B00ADW4I9O|5.0|This is the soundtrack I've been waiting twenty years for. Wonderful interior text, quality recordings, missing songs long thought lost, and variants of some.<br /><br />I would have bought this set for one song only, the wickedly hedonistic tune from the Tower of Set. I got soooooo much more.<br /><br />Best buy of 2012 for me, hands down.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I think many people have become too complacent about email, social media, etc.  As an amateur radio operator I learned very early that the air waves are a party line, like the telephone used to be.  This book really pointed out how vulnerable it all is.

B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun if you are into hidden object games. Hard to progress if you are not willing to use actual money to purchase the things you need to advance and complete challenges.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Some of the music for me took some warming up to, but after listening to most of the soundtrack a few times over, I found many of the songs to be very good. I think this soundtrack, arguably, rivals Howard Shore's previous soundtracks for The Lord of the Rings.<br />My favorite song on the soundtrack is actually \\"The Song of the Lonely Mountains\\" (which, after reading another review on Amazon and finding out Howard Shore had nothing to do with this track, I feel kind of guilty for, but still enjoy this song the most). However, most of the soundtrack was written by Howard Shore, and there are many other great, orchestral pieces on the soundtrak. Some of my favorites include \\"Axe or Sword?\\", \\"The Adventure Begins\\", \\"Dreaming of Bag End\\", and \\"Erebor\\". Its nice to hear songs from the book on here, namely, the songs \\"Blunt the Knives\\" and \\"Misty Mountains\\". Both of these songs are great, and \\"Misty Mountains\\" comes in as a close second as my favorite song. You can also hear themes from the origianl Lord of the Rings trilogy on here, too. The song \\"Hidden Valley\\" uses the Rivendell theme (as it no doubt is the song used for when the group comes to Rivendell), and at the end of \\"The Adventure Begins\\" there is a more upbeat version of the tune used in \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" from \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" soundtrack.<br />I have not yet seen the movie (though plan to go this very afternoon (December 22, 2012)), and this soundtrack definitely makes me excited to go see the movie, and I recommend it to everyone interested in The Hobbit and who enjoys movie scores.<br />Finally, like I mentioned in the title, the ONLY reason this soundtrack gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the packaging of the special edition. The special edition is set up like a booklet, with some photos and lyrics in the middle, and the CDs are put in envelope-like slots on the inner side of the front and back. This makes it difficult to get the CDs out of and into the case. I would havemuch preferred if they had put plastic over the inner side, and made it so the CDs snapped into plastic holders like on most cases. I did burn the CDs onto my computer and will probably mostly listen to them on my computer, but I still think the packaging should have made it easier to get the CDs out and into the case. However, considering we do live in a digital age and most people won't be using the actualy physical soundtracks, this is a small issue and I still recommend The Hobbit soundtrack. Just be warned if you order the physical edition of the special edition to be careful getting the CDs out.<br /><br />Update 02/17/2014: I added a star back on because, even though the packaging of the CDs in the envelope-like slots on the inside is still a poor way of packaging the CDs, it is now irrelevant! The Desolation of Smaug soundtrack also came similarly packaged, but it was no problem because in the last year Amazon came out with AutoRip, which is probably one of their best ideas ever. You get the MP3s automatically delivered to your device upon purchasing the albums (and you have them right in the morning on the release date if you pre-order the album), and you do not need to worry about getting at the CDs to download your music and possibly damaging the CDs in the process.

B007C7UZIG|5.0|I love Steam. Super convenient way to be able to reinstall your games (not ever having to worry about CD keys or discs).
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I admit to being a fan of this genre, but a PICKY one at that. Rebecca Hamilton's writing is well structured, imaginative and original. This \\"prelude - lovesong\\" to \\"The Forever Girl\\" series is a wonderful embellishment to the storyline.<br /><br />With characters both strong and flawed, I was \\"compelled\\" to read this straight through. I don't want to spoil anything for current and future \\"Forever Girl\\" readers, but this (for me at the very least) gave an additional strength and feeling for the main novel and overall saga.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and do not hesitate to recommend it to lovers of paranormal romance, and those looking for unique storylines in this genre.<br /><br />I wait eagerly for the next installment of this series - and any other novellas and/or short stories that add to this reading experience.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|...this movie is for you. Every frame is a master piece. The humor is brilliant. I'd say every actor is outside his/her traditional role.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you streamed it from amazon it was a tad buggy at least more so then netflix but since netflix didnt have it,I had to buy it from here.Great show however, much better than the 2nd season.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie at first I thought would be a waste of time and money, but has proven me wrong. It has open my eyes to a variety of things. Job well done to the director and cast for making a very intriguing and funny movie. I would suggest this movie to friends and family. Its good to watch the movie first and see what you think of it before judging it..lol Bravo
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun, reminds me of being at the carnival when I was a kid. Wish there were more games like this out there for tablets.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Picoult's story was absolutely intriguing and a real page turner. I couldn't put it down! I loved her writing and how connected she allows you to get to the characters. If you are looking for a book that will pull at your emotions, get this book!

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a really high quality gaming mouse. It's not overly large, like many gaming mice, and it's got removable weights in a very nice box that allows you to tune the weight of the mouse. the mouse is about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide at its longest and widest point, respectively. The ergonomics of the mouse are very nice; it fits very well into my hand. The buttons are placed well on the side and top of the mouse. The cord is covered in woven chord, keeping it very durable. I'd recommend this item for anyone, from amateur game enthusiast to serious \\"full time\\" gamer. Greatly enjoy it.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|this is the best game ever for pocket edition!!!!!not only it lets you get FREE gold it lets you get stuff thats in the next update!buy it already!!!!i wish i could rate it 50000000000 stars!!!!:)
0385341008|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is a lovely story and the language reminds of of when I lived in Europe. It is full of quirky British humor and has a huge heart.  I would say it is a peaceful read. I hope you enjoy it as well.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I like puzzles like this because, as a child I did not have many opportunities to use manipulatives while learning.  As an adult I realized that I was spatially challenged.  Puzzles like these are a good way for me to exercise my brain.  At first I found myself randomly moving the pieces, but after a while, I started to think ahead and develop strategies for completing the puzzles.

0802130208|2.0|I had tried once to get through the first chapter of A Confederacy of Dunces before putting the book down in utter frustration. I stuck it out and read the whole thing this time, but still didn't care for the book.  It seems the majority of the readers love this novel, but I really couldn't wait to be done with it. Virtually every character is unlikable and obnoxious to the umpteenth degree. The sheer obnoxiousness of this novel is difficult to bare. The author tries to make Ignatius as some sort of Don Quixote of 1960 New Orleans or antihero spouting his philosophies on Big Chief tablets, but it just doesn't work and comes across as rather sad and trite.<br /><br />One issue was simply that these weren't characters; they were cartoons.  People commend the book for its dialogue, which they say is \\"real\\", but it felt more like a sitcom to me. And, much like an episode of Seinfeld, the dialogue and situations went in circles in A Confederacy of Dunces with little substance. Virtually every character behaves on the level of a maniac. Many of the other characters, seemingly caricatures, continually repeated the same cycle of badgering and belittling each other in the various episodes (Jones and the  bar owner, Mr. and Mrs. Levy, Mancuso and the sergeant, Ignatius and his mother, etc).<br /><br />Yeah, I get it: it's a farce, comedy, satire, etc. Still, the ridiculousness of the subplots and the level of humor just made this novel feel cheap. The whining, yelling and general chaos was more of a chore to get through than entertainment. Sure, A Confederacy of Dunces might be mildly entertaining at points (I thought some of Ignatius' intelligent journal entries were humorous), but most of the humor is sophomoric. I vacillated between despising Ignatius and feeling genuine pity and sorrow at his pathetic, deranged existence.<br /><br />In final, this is a novel that really irritates more than entertains, which is a pity, because I had high hopes.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Not much point in even writing an elaborate review - the headline speaks for itself - buyer beware - High probability of disappointed kids everywhere on Dec 25th!

B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Very good book<br />I really liked these books I read every one of them<br />Very good best books !!!!!!!!!! Great
B004LROUNG|3.0|Maybe Grisham did too well in his earlier books so I'm spoiled.  The Firm is still one of the best books I have read in this genre. Simple yet exciting; predictable yet engrossing.  Man do I long for those days.  The Pelican Brief and so on.  What happened to THAT Grisham.  However, I'll still buy anything he has written for adults and will definitely enjoy it.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|This movie started out fairly well, with a gripping and emotional storyline. As it progressed however, the characters developed poorly and the ending was anticlimactic. Very disappointing.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|SPOILER-FREE<br /><br />I was worried about season 2 of Homeland; worried that they would not be able to re-capture the atmosphere and intensity of the first.  In a way, I was a little right.  I personally think the first season is quite a bit better, but being in one of the top 5 television dramas currently on television, it's easily a 5/5 stars still.<br /><br />It's really hard to say too much without giving away spoilers.  The best way to put it - things change...and they change A LOT.  The whole dynamics of the show are different this season.  A startling revelation is discovered early on and turns the show completely on its head.  The formula is different, but for the most part, the outcomes are the same.  It is still one of the shows best at creating tension and suspense and is a true CIA thriller.<br /><br />CAST - the actors are superbly cast.  Mandy Patinkin as Saul is incredible as ever this season, and even gets almost a whole episode dedicated to his acting talents.  Claire Danes is perfect as the emotionally unstable, yet brilliant Carrie.  Damian Lewis as Nicholas Brody has a lot of emotions to balance, obviously, and does it well.  The supporting cast is also pretty talented.  Homeland also garnered a lot of attention when they practically stole the Emmys with Best Drama, Best Actor in a Drama (Lewis) and Best Actress in a Drama (Claire Danes).<br /><br />STORYLINE - things are definitely different this season.  Does Carrie get her vengeance for what Brody did to her at the end of last season by telling Estes?  Do her and Brody get romantic again?  You'll just have to see, but things are shaken up and are very different from last season.  And they happen quickly.  It's incredibly difficult to give away much without spoiling, but there's always a black cloud over everything, and you never know what will happen next.  Sometimes it's surprisingly predictable, and other times it's really out of nowhere.<br /><br />BELIEVABILITY - okay, things get a little murky here.  On one hand, this *is* entertainment, not a documentary.  On the other hand, viewers and critics tend to value at least some semblance of realism in their dramas these days, especially on premium cable channels.  There was one episode in particular this season ('Broken Hearts') that really upset a lot of critics and many viewers due to how far they stretched the realm of the possibility.  Forgivable?  Definitely, for a show like this.  But they *were* somewhat resorting to cheap plot tricks to make stuff happen like a B terrorist movie instead of clever writing, so hopefully it was a fluke.<br /><br />FUN FACTOR - lots of fun!  It's a high quality action/thriller/terrorist show, so you can expect plenty of drama, chases, near-deaths, plotting, deception, character moral ambiguity....there's definitely so many fun aspects to it that make it worth watching.<br /><br />If you want to be in the loop of the best shows on television, you should definitely be watching Homeland!e murky here.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I have a wee bit of an addiction to flashlights and this, without a doubt, is the finest one I own. It has a crazy brilliant LED lamp that has what to me is the perfect amount of long distance spot beam with enough side splash. The reflector is perfectly smooth as it the beam that it produces. The two buttons take a few minutes to get muscle memory and are very positive and easy to work. The light feels very sturdy and the grip has a very aggressive texture which makes for an easy hold. The bezel has flats so that it doesn't roll. since it runs on eight AA batteries it has lots and lots of available power.<br /><br />The light feels very sturdy but not too heavy - fills the hand very well.<br /><br />I use this hiking in the desert where the low power 10 lumen setting allows just a bit of light to see where we're going. A push on the button bring up the power quickly to spot a distant animal with ease. On \\"turbo\\" I was able to illuminate a distant hillside over 100 yards away. There are two strobe modes - one where the flashlight cycles between rapid and slower strobes which is very attention grabbing. The second mode is a slow and steady SOS Morse code.<br /><br />You know you've bought a serious flashlight when it comes in a plastic semi-hard case!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|SPOILER-FREE<br /><br />After last year's somewhat abysmal season and painfully unfair cliffhanger finale, season 7 (the one before the last!) really picks up.  There's a lot of good 'ol fashioned Dexter drama, and while there was plenty of over attention to guest star storylines while neglecting the main cast (like always!), the best part of this season is how the relationship between Dexter and Debra is really explored.  Debra has to deal with a LOT of emotions from what she witnessed in the season six finale, and this season is very Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall focused (Debra and Dexter Morgan), which is a GREAT thing for this show.<br /><br />DEBRA/DEXTER - hands down, the interactions between the two are the best moments of the season.  They're better than all of the other interactions and character development combined by far, and Hall and Carpenter are such amazing actors that other actors at times have difficulty keeping up with them in terms of skill (Velez as Laguerta is a good example).  Carpenter is definitely one of the most underrated actresses on television.  While I know Dexter may not be the best show of all time, Carpenter could literally be given the worst script ever and turn it into gold.  Carpenter is really what makes this season shine to its fullest, and it's really a travesty that she wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe!  And her performance in the finale was really heart-wrenching and beautifully done.<br /><br />Oh, and no, and the show didn't forget about Debra realizing she's in love with her brother.<br /><br />LAGUERTA - Laguerta finds a blood slide in the first episode at Travis' murder scene and starts to do some serious investigation into whether or not the Bay Harbor Butcher is still alive and well.  This causes a lot of drama and confusion for Laguerta, who becomes increasingly more prevalent as the season progresses.  Matthews also comes back, and he's just as big of a jerk as ever.<br /><br />JOEY QUINN - eh.  Definitely one of the worst storylines of the season.  Something about him and a stripper and some guy is mad about....I don't know.  It was so boring I literally already forgot about it.<br /><br />BATISTA - Batista is also incredibly pointless this season.  He has dreams to open some lame restaurant and retire.  I don't know.  Dexter tends to value its guest stars a lot more than its core cast.<br /><br />Speaking of....GUEST STARS -<br /><br />HANNAH - Hannah McKay was the accomplice of a serial killer as a teen, and ended up being let go for a variety of factors.  Hannah and Dexter have great on-screen chemistry when they talk to each other, and there's something hauntingly ominous in her eyes that reminds Dexter of himself.  They have secrets to share.  And she becomes a huge part of the storyline as the season progresses, including a couple very vicious verbal run-ins between her and Debra.  A bad character?  No.  But the way her storyline turned out toward the end of the season really leaves me scratching my head in confusion.<br /><br />SIRKO - Issak Sirko is the boss of a Ukrainian criminal organization called Koshka (which means little kitty cat in Russian...very scary) and played by the amazing Ray Stevenson (Titus in HBO's Rome).  Unfortunately, as much as I love Stevenson, his storyline was one of the biggest bombs of the season.  While I'm glad they decided to use Hannah and Sirko as guest stars this season instead of one big, bad menacing evil person, Sirko fell flat because he seemed to be nothing short of a cartoonish villain.  I never found him to be particularly interesting or scary, and it's comparable to Quinn in the terms that it's so bad that I'm almost blocking it out of memory.<br /><br />FUN - this season is fun because with a couple of exceptions, it wasn't trying to be bigger than it's supposed to be.  Dexter always thrives when it tries to be more classic fun and thrilling rather than thought-provoking and touching.  While it doesn't always failat that, I do feel the writers have difficulties at times when trying to make their characters too deep.  Without spoiling anything, there's a certain scene later in the episode where Dexter has some kind of daydreams (or maybe they were dreams) of what his future could be like, and it just felt cheesy, out of place, and even spoiled the ending of the episode if you really paid attention.<br /><br />However, there's not a whole lot of that this season, and the finale is one of the best I may have ever seen on Dexter.  It wasn't a disgusting cheap cliffhanger like last season; it wrapped things up nicely for the season that just finished while still leaving plenty of loose ends.  It sets a darker, ominous tone that we've ever felt on Dexter before.  And with next season being the last (most likely), expect for the traditional Dexter formulae to change dramatically...there really is no telling what will happen next!<br /><br />What is truly worth watching it though?  Even if every other storyline *was* terrible this season?  The interactions between Dexter and Debra.  Not only are the acting performances amazing, but Debra is so well-written and completely believable in every difficult line she delivers.  Debra has been a very consistent character along with Dexter since the beginning of the series, so seeing the two develop their relationship between each other so much is really a treat to watch.at that, I do feel the writers have difficulties at times when trying to make their characters too deep.

The emotion and longing Mr. MacFadyen expresses with one look, most actors would need a full page of dialog to convey.  This is old fashioned romance at its best

030758836X|3.0|Wow, about 5 thousand reviews on Amazon; a raging bestseller, one of the 10 top books of the year according to Janet Maslin, and I am about to trash it!<br />Shallowest of shallow characters. The vernacular is of the adolescent/Howard Stern type of vulgarity carried to an extreme length which makes people like me cringe. Do<br />I have to delve into such sexual details that leave nothing to the imagination but throw up an aura of unbridled depravity?<br />The story itself is partly interesting, one thinks of the recent cases of pregnant wives disappearing and it does hold its suspense for some time. The logicality of the twist<br />and double twist (at the end) defy human emotions. I am not giving away the plot, but it's nothing new and has been done better. The supporting cast, in this case the sister, the flamboyant<br />attorney, the parents are given the cursoriest of character traits that are not found outside of the usual trashy literature.<br />Well, it sells. It's selling. I don't have anything against that. I can almost bet, twenty years ago, even ten, most top publishing houses would have not caused this book to see print without some drastic cuts. Lady Chatterly is finally vindicated: although that was sleaze with class.

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|If you're losing at this game, try this: Switch to a gamepad, or even a Bluetooth keyboard. On small screens (smartphones) you will fail a lot more often trying to mash your fingers against a tiny screen. Even though this is a touch-friendly remake of a classic gaming style -- it's still the same type of game that is best played with a gamepad/joystick.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|I gotta say, Chris Hardwick missed this one.<br /> Despite his gloomy review, I risked 4.99 (Amazon prime price) for this great chunk of movie nosh.<br />  The original story line, with a dream within a dream, is always a difficult script to shoot.<br />  But, both editing, and surprisingly good acting, puts this on a must see list.<br />  A lush, but not overly sold (Think, Jon Carpenter) scenery gelled well.<br />  Overall, a strong, achievement for both cast and crew.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|Great Christmas music in James Taylor fashion. Easy listening and great background music. Will definitely play this Christmas Eve and Christmas Day when family is opening presents.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great book.  Takes you through every emotion you've got!  Crying one minute and laughing out loud the next.  Would recommend to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|After you get used to how to nagigate, you will be able to find a chapter and verse very quickly. Can't imagine it being any quicker to navigate. I use the KJV version consider to be a literal translation but can very easily compare it to the GNB translation a paraphrase for seventh or eighth graders. For me most the time this is as good as a commentary and answers most the questions that I am not sure of in the KJV translation. Not only that but you get right to the same book, chapter, verse that you are currently studying very easily. It will increase your enjoyment of reading Gods word (hopefully will be addicting :). It has many other features not mentioned, check youversion.com. You can turn off the wifi and use it at home or Church. But thats only if you download the various translations to the device (I use a kindle fire HD), currently have 4 translations downloaded (were also free) Praise The Lord, Am thankful for the Church that does the programming, and continual commitment, and upgrades,  amazon for providing it, and am thanfull to who were involved in the pricing, its still hard to believe its free for such a quality product. Would recommend this to any and everyone one. Thank you
B000PMLFRA|5.0|All 3 dvds in 1 case, shrink wrapped & given as gift.  Excellent condition, have watched all 3 with no scratches, skips or problems.  Excellent value for hard to find item.  Thanks!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection of 5 books is one of the more original stories I have read in a long time. They are well written with characters I found myself caring about. As others have said, it truly is hard to put this down. I lost some sleep reading these.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|As far as simple, free games go this is one of the best ones out there.  I don't like games that I have to think too hard over (I'm in my 40's, work at a call center & use games like this as a distraction when I'm in between calls or if I'm waiting somewhere like a dentists office) & this one is a lot of fun.  It's a great way to kill time, the graphics are really nice (no skipping or jumping around/doesn't sieze up) & there's a lot more going on than just pushing coins.  There are several levels to this game & I've played it off & on for over a month straight (probably 60 hours at least).  It's easy to level up & get more coins without spending any real money for upgrades (you can get to level 5 in about 10-15 min) & the whole format is just well laid out.  Hasn't gotten boring yet & you can't beat free!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie is so bad, need to be flushed into public toilet! Maybe it only works out with some dirty middle aged guys but, for mankind sake, please save your time and money for something worthy.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Its hard to make that sunday tv reservation some times so this is perfect . Can't wait for the second half of the season.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Somehow, this movie doesn't give you the magic feeling as the original Bourne movie.  There are a lot plots that you feel like borrowed from somewhere else, for example, the opening scene is kind of deja vu from &#34;Hanna&#34;.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was hilarious, and exactly what I was expecting from Seth McFarland. If you are going to watch it, watch it unrated!
B003JBHQP4|5.0|How often we find ourselves with memory cards from any electronic device and don't have the corresponding Card Reader for that device that we can use to read its content. This little gadget hooks up to the USB port and reads 21 different card types. Highly recommended.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game. Except that I can not beat the last level. Otherwise it is superbly completely surely awesomely awesome.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book was not what I was expecting. If you are into science and explanations of those kind then this is perfect for you. if you are wanting to hear about his actual experience in heaven then this is not it. The book was like going to a movie but only seeing a preview. He also never even mentioned the bible or Jesus.
1609611543|5.0|I am learning a lot about this and it does make sense.  When I was very young, wheat was different than it is today.  It has been genetically altered to creep into our foods, as Americans are getting bigger and sicker.  Read it and weep, but learn which foods are ok to eat.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|What more could I ask for? It's great paste and cheap, too! I've never had a single problem with it!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a quick read, not a lot of concentration needed. The premise was different but as in all good romance stories the couple finally get together.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I know and  respect  navy seals a lot more after reading this book and how dedicated they are to our country.  I'm very proud of our military and proud to be an American.
B007VUCAVO|3.0|Good but only says how long the battery will last and it also works on kindle fire HD very good
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|If you love the tv show NASHVILLE you will REALLY love this CD.  Even though my husband and I have never been big country music fans, we started watching this tv show and got hooked on it.  Right after we received the CD from Amazon, we put it in our CD player and started dancing around the family room.  After being married for 26 years, my husband said he didn't know I could still dance like that......ha ha :)  The music is really energizing, sexy, and fun.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was expecting a really good suspense story from all the positive reviews. What a let down!  I rarely review books and this is my first negative review.  The author is a talented writer, and because she made me dislike the characters in this book so thoroughly,  is the ONLY reason I'm giving this book two stars. The story started a bit slow, never really picked up and at about twenty percent into the book you knew what the end of part one was going to be. I continued to read because I hate not finishing a book, which leads me to that ending... how implausible....  I can suspend disbelief better than most and I love all kinds of good stories...  This was not one of them...
B007ZUVDPY|5.0|This is a tremendous book, very easy reading, but could be very deep, and could provide life changing experience. I, as a serious Christian, sometimes struggle with my faith and reality of the world. This book helped me tremendously to find the bridge between the two, so I experienced the great freedom!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great reading keep me interested on the edge of my sit knowing most of this really happen.  Would recommend this book to all who served in any branch of the service.
B008XBASVY|5.0|The book was well-written and had a great story.  It kept me wanting to know more.  Chris Colfer is as great a writer as he is an actor and singer.  Loved this book!
B000067QMD|5.0|I wanted the cabs to have a save close for our bottles when traveling. This happend to be the case, what makes this caps the thing I needed and wanted to have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the first time I started reading this book I knew I was hooked. Great character development and an engaging story that mesmerized me right from the beginning. Left me wanting to learn so much more about the story. Can't wait to read the other parts of the series!!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Bought some of my favorites to watch with my granddaughter.  She is 12 and she loved this movie. We watched it over and over and even did karioke with the music. Good memories.
B00062PN6I|5.0|THis headphone set has exceeded my expectations- it is exemplary! I would tell anyone about it if they were looking for a set.
B002MW50KO|4.0|Though I like Dylan (who over 50 does't), listening to him sing classic Christmas songs was well... weird. I kept expecting something about &#34;Chirstmas in 'Nam,&#34; or a protest song about the commercialization  of the Holidays.<br /><br />Yet, there is one exception,  &#34;It Must Be Santa.&#34; This fast-paced polka styled Christmas song some how fits that deep-whiskey voice of his, I think he has fun singing it, and the listener has more fun hearing it, This song is one for your holiday collection<br />l
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. I have played their Pc games and am highly impressed with the app. The graphics ;gameplay; and puzzles are excellent.
B00003CXB7|1.0|Well, I decided to watch M*A*S*H again, after some three decades.<br /><br />My, how times change!<br /><br />I saw this movie several times as a teen back in the 70's, and just loved it. It has been called the first great movie of the 1970's, a seminal flic in that decade of great American cinema (perhaps the greatest.) And it shows Robert Altman at his finest, with natural dialogue and multi-layered scenes. Throw in the all-star ensemble cast and you you should have a winner.<br /><br />What I really liked was the hyper realism of the operating room and the medical scenes. I'm sure people thought it was pretty gory for its time, but the realism is far less ostentatiously bloody than a recent movie, like say Academy Award best picture \\"The Departed.\\"<br /><br />Mind you, my opinion has now changed.<br /><br />First, the movie is undeniably sexist. Women are objects in the movie, and we are talking the absolutely vital nurses that, as we now know, are the real backbone of any hospital. And there is a whiff of homophobia.<br /><br />Additionally, I read a NYT review that suggested that this was the first mainstream movie to openly mock organized religion. Now I like a good laugh at the expense of a holy roller just as much as the next guy, for sure. But, while there are few very humourous moments, mostly these scenes come off as cruel and disrespectful.<br /><br />I know that this movie was really a critique of the Vietnam War dressed up as Korea (while that war was going on!) but there are just too many sour bits for me to enjoy the movie anymore.<br /><br />Perhaps the most annoying thing is that the movie vacillates been hyper-realistic seriousness (which it does with panache and really well,) and plain silly comedy. You know, if I was the editor, I would have taken out a few of the sillier scenes, and a lot of the sexism, and I think you'd have the \\"classic\\" that many people feel M*A*S*H is.<br /><br />But I'm not the editor, and I won't be watching it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok so. my friend told me it was free but I got on my mom's phone and saw it cost 6.99 and it does too on my kindle. Why does it cost spool MUCH!!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very Funny and thrilling. Very well researched novel of fiction.<br />Love the main character's interactions with all the other characters
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is fun fun fun me and my brother both play this game. all the time and we both love this game
B000G8P1VE|4.0|I received in mail promptly. I enjoy watching this movie over the years and look forward to watching it unedited.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its a good game but its not the best in the world I have better games on my kindle fire
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|My 6 year old grandson absolutely loves this.  He actually will even repeat some of the puzzles.  He calls it the elf game.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next book to come out!!!! I've read this 3 times already. Can't help but feel what the characters are feeling and root for Travis.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Only gotten thru it once but overall a winner,  Florence has such a smooth and powerful voice.  A good one to relax to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the reason how I new about tho game is because my friends told me to get the app and it was totally worth using the app space. I would recommend this game to people that like temple run. you get chased by Santa and roudolph in the Christmas special in the game and then in the regular version you get chased by a dog and investegater. it is a must have app. you have to get it.,
B003ELOQD4|3.0|Great quality picture and sound.  You can really tell how they aged.  But it is a good show.  They could have done a better job with picking some older and better tracks for the show.
1609613937|5.0|I was on Atkins long before Atkins. :-) I ate very little starch and was about 25 lbs. overweight. I committed to the Starch Solution 13 days ago.  I have lost 14 lbs.in 13 days.<br /><br />I almost quit the 1st day. I never ate oatmeal. The first time I tried to cook the natural stuff, it boiled over. Gag! it looks horrible. But I succeeded in the simple task of cooking oatmeal. It is delicious, and I ate 2 serving and a banana. No coffee! Just water! That is the  most filling and energizing meal I have ever eaten. I did not eat again for about 8 hours. The I ate a baked potato wirh salsa and backed spinach patties and a sliced tomato..I took a B-12.<br />Next week, I will have the lab work done. I an encouraged by the weight loss and tremendous energy. About 30 years ago, a good friend told me to quit the meat. I wish I had listened. What do they say?  &#34;Too soon old...too late smart&#34;. Very true..
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector:<br /><br />Good story line and flow. Characters are true to life as is the story line.A very plaucible scenario.A must read!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Just what I enjoy on a weather source. Runs equal to my local weather source on my lap top and is always up to date,easy to use.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Very enjoyable movie for a Saturday night.the 3d on this disc is really good in every shot. Worth the 19.99.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|cannot figure out out to use it!Have tried many times and I am pretty smart with this kind of aff.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a big fan and this season was the best yet. I don't regret buying them at all, and can't wait until next season. You got me on the edge of my seat!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting with proof of heaven. He reports it from an experience with medical evidence. He truly was chosen with a purpose.
B00AE2J93I|2.0|Nothing exciting. Has references that younger kids may not understand. This is one of those movies you only watch once.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I instaled this app like 2 weeks ago, it haves good grafics, is very entretaining but it crashes a lot on my ematic 4xl tablet that it suposed to be good for games and internet activities, it may be the tablet, guive this app a trie it may work better fo you...
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Rihanna is a very good entertainer and I enjoyed her new album. It is a good album to just mellow out to.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pick this book up and just enjoy the ride. It's not a masterpiece, but an immensely fun, quick read that at times will keep you guessing, and at times make you think about the authors (many) influences. This is a book I'd imagine I'd write if I had the time or talent. The pacing is just right, and the plot, albeit a bit \\"I've seen this before\\" is engaging enough to keep the pages turning long into the night. The only downside I'd give it is other than Ethan, the protagonist, there isn't all that many characters and this not much development. Those seeking a character filled story to drive the narrative should look elsewhere.
0316069434|4.0|Sometimes you just want to settle in with an old friend and get lost in his world for awhile and it is easy to do with Harry Bosch. The plotting, at least with regards to solving the mystery is clever and full of \\"where does he go from here and how does he get the information\\" points that make this series so enjoyable. I agree with some of the other reviewers that there is more of a TV script like quality to this one, and I found the principal perp's ability to pull together what was happening based on a few random clues to be a bit improbable but the book held my interest and was an enjoyable read.
B001EO748M|5.0|THIS WAS NOT MINE I AM JUST FILLING OUT THE FEEDBACKS I DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT i WATCHED THE FIRST ONE AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYMORE SO MOM MAY HAVE SENT THEM BACK I AM NOT SURE AND SHE IS NOW DECEASED i AM JUST FILLING OUT OLD FEED BACKS THAT NEVER GOT A  ANSWER..I AM CLOSING OUT THIS ACCOUNT DUE TO A BAD PROBLEM WITH AMAZON SO I WANTED TO GIVE THE PEOPLE THERE FEEDBACKS THEY DESERVE
B005IQZB14|4.0|amazing story and well written however I was struck by the author's narcissism which while it did not take away from her writing skill, certainly irritated me as the reader.  Nothing was as important as her goals.  No one else' feeling seem to matter and in fact, she took advantage of many of her well wishers.  Interesting for her guts.  Little personal insight which is surprising considering the experience she undertook.
B000P12LWY|5.0|AS I HAVE WROTE I AM CLOSING OUT THIS ACCOUNT DUE TO A ISSUE WITH AMAZON IT SHOULD BEEN CLOSED 4 YEARS AGO SO MY MOM IS GONE/DEAD AND I TRULY DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS I SAW TE FIRST ONE ON TV BUT IF SHE ORDERED I HAVE NOT SAW IT AROUND THE HOUSE IN 4 EARS SO I AM NOT SURE IF SHE  GOT I OR SENT IT BACK TO BE HONEST ITS NOT WITH THE CD'S WE HAVE.
B001JU4S44|1.0|Boring.  I would enjoyed a rerun of one of the old tv shows much more.  I honestly fell asleep.  Boring.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Great special effects, however storyline is very slow starting out. Acting is average, I was hoping for much better. Worth a watch, but that is all.
B0020M99LC|1.0|No plot.  Movie went on, and on, and on, we kept hoping it would end.<br />Really America? Is this what entertains us?  Feel as though we wasted an evening.<br />Wasn't aware of the torture scene.  Seems like a PG-13 rating was not strong enough.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very good novel with a good message.  Would highly recommend for all dog lovers. Would like to read more of this author's novels
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I read every page of this and was entertained the entire time! I believe it's the equal of the previous books. I don't agree with a few other reviewers who don't see the point of its story. It covers a lot of new ground and new places. I'm moving on to Dance with Dragons.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer is a very interesting read. You like the main character from the beginning and held captive to a world that is unknown to most people. I have read most of the books written by Grisham and this is one of his best.  I highly recommend this book as it is a real page turner.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved this movie!  Watched it on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" and the animation is Beautiful!  I'm a forty-something year old big kid, so even adults would enjoy this film.  Highly recommend!!  :o))
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it and all my dragons. I can play my same game over multiple devices, which is nice for on the go play. Can't think of one complaint yet. The game runs as expected every time and the seasonal updates don't look cut and pasted... Great job with this one backflip! :)
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I was really enjoying this game, with it's cute graphics and storyline. I went to go play it again and it put me back to level 1! I was at level 25 with about $55,000. I'm very upset by this and cannot bring myself to play a game that will randomly do this to me.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|This cd had a good mix of some of my favorite Kelly songs as well as a couple I had not heard before.  For the price I paid on AMAZON it was very well worth buying .
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|it's worth a buck, I guess. the point on some cams is terrible but it can't be avoided so I'm not going to accuse the app or developer
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Not Compatible With My Impression 10 tablet.  My grandson was looking forward to it.  May be some time in the future it will wotk
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its awesome I thought it was going dumb but Its addicting and I love it Try it out because its soooooo fun!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this series with each book getting even better.  I give it 5 stars because I can't seem to stop reading it!  I am actually in the second book for the second time.  =)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I was curious about the angry bird games after hearing my elementary school age children talk about them.  I was happy to check it out for free.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I only recently rediscovered this show as I had forgotten all about it.  I used to watch this as I child and I was reluctant to start watching it again.  It often happens that returning to the shows that we loved in childhood will taint those happy memories because they are very seldom as good as we thought they were when we were young.  I am so happy that I decided to give it a shot.  Even now, 20 years later, this show is just as entertaining and inspiring as it was all those years ago and, I think, I enjoy it more now because I can actually follow the storylines and character arcs.<br /><br />IMHO, this is a good, wholesome family drama that can be enjoyed by all ages.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't believe they s[plit the season in half and I have to wait until February to see what happens next!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I see why this is a popular game.  It is fun and addicting.  I can't get my new kindle away from my husband when he is at home.  He has always got it playing angry birds..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A typical John Grisham read, with a good cast of characters, and lots of action.  Plenty to enjoy and well worth the cost.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I read the Hunger Games in a day and it took me about three days to read Catching Fire. I'm planning to read Mockingjay to finish the trilogy. I didn't plan to see the movie, but decided to take a look. I thought the visual look of the film was well done. The casting was also well done. The only problem with the film was that the story was flat and seemed to just string together choice scenes from the book. Not much time was spent on character development. So it was hard for me to root for the characters. Maybe it is an editing problem because some scenes are too long or some scenes jump ahead that it seems something was missing in between. If people that saw the Hunger Games haven't read the book yet, I'd definitely recommend that they read the book to fill in the blanks.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|The extraordinary overabundance of lengthy explanations, lead-ins and just pure verbal crap ruins the enjoyment of an otherwise good premise for a story.  A long-time fan of Nelson DeMille, this is the first of his novels that I was tempted, over and over again, to just give up on.  The meat of the story probably didn't comprise 200 pages.  I was truly disappointed.
B0086HJW76|5.0|Having been a Joe Walsh fan since the early '70's maybe I'm kinda biased. This album is not for the top 40, follow-the-leader, conformist crowd. This album is for his fans! Walsh is back! Analog Man shoots straight from the hip and is very thought provoking. If you like straight talk, tongue-in-cheek comedy and great rock 'n' roll then this music is a refreshing change from the crap the music industry is pushing at us these days!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun and interesting, but some of them  are hard to play because you can't see everything because of your hands being in the way. Otherwise it a great collection of games
B003NX76BM|5.0|Enjoyed this from beginning to end.  It was very suspenseful, but yet romantic.  Would read it over and over again.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|It is beyond comprehension that this so called highlights album would omit the biggest hit song in the show-\\"Do You hear the People Sing\\". It's like \\"Hello Dolly\\" or \\"Mame\\"without the title song. It makes no sense. Yes a two disc full soundtrack will be released and will rip everyone off as it will mean people have to buy this and then the full soundtrack later on (my advice is to wait) but so many people are clamouring to hear what these actors sound like ,singing live . !!!(this aspect has been ridiculously over emphasised in the publicity, it has been done before-\\"At Long Last Love\\"(horror) and Rex H in \\"My Fair Lady' for example).<br /><br />The editing of key songs is a manipulation, as there have been other highlights albums that have included all the main songs from the various stage versions.<br /><br />As to the album itself ---- lets be kind and say what is there leaves a lot to be desired and without the visual, listening to Russell Crowe is torturous. (why would you leave his death scene on a highlight album and leave off \\"Do You hear the People\\". \\"Heart Full of love\\" etc)Some very bad decisions have been made in the marketing of this album. Are Universal that desperate they needed to rip off their listening public? Decisions like this tend to back fire and leave a bad taste not just about the Cd but the movie itself.
B000W93CHC|5.0|What a great reading experience.  I was completely absorbed in the story from start to finish.  Ken Follett did it again
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is good no glitches ... I waste a lot of time in here but its fun runs kind of slow sometimes though recommends this app
0439023491|5.0|This book was hard to put down and I am really enjoying the series. The ending builds you up for the next book and I am glad I am a bit late reading this one so I can just keep moving on. Very enjoyable read
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The book keeps you engaged because it is not only historical but it is a novel about the lives of people their struggles in a new nation that could have taken a very different direction had it not been for people like Lincoln whose strong conviction in what he believed shaped the nation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The Fifty Shades series of books has thouroughly captured and enraptured me! The Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele characters will remain in my mind for a long time. I thought the series would be mainly about the sexual relationships but the author really showed the reason behind some of the need for the unconventional sex taking place.<br /><br />Cant wait for the next book. If the last one is any indication, we may hear things from Mr. Grey's side...
B003INBNXO|5.0|Donnie Yen has done a great job of bringing the legendary Wing Chun Kung Fu Grandmaster Ip Man's life story and wonderful Kung Fu back to life in this entertaining and action packed film. It is a fitting tribute to a true legend in the martial arts community.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|A must see. Johnny Depp never fails to deliver a great performance. I would have givin it 5 stars but I though it could have been funnier.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Deep, powerful, and exciting! I really love the innovative yet believable culture and customs. This could be a hit at the box office. Can't wait for the next book!
B00A7CI82I|4.0|What's not to like? Good, intelligent story, great action, great acting, great locations, etc. First class film making. I'll watch it again and again.
B0035FQ1UU|3.0|Don't watch this thinking it's anything other than a disaster film.  There's very little serious plot, the acting is just above average, and the science is beyond laughable... but who cares?!?!<br /><br />The action and effects are fun, the movie is pretty, and there is just enough of that minimal plot and acting to tie all the crazy together.<br /><br />Younger kids might be traumatized, but everyone else will likely be entertained.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Such a wonderful telling of a deep story...thoroughly enjoyable reading...read it before I saw the movie and glad I did.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A family moment for all to enjoy during the holidays!  Plan with hot chocolate and cookies and sit back and ride the Polar Express!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook app for Kindle Fire only shows the latest (from entry) posts. Then about five blue blocks of posts. There is no option to show more posts. Also the events, including birthdays do not show up..nothing. I am very dissapointed....I bought the Kindle because I love Amazon, Kindle is great but I'm not happy with the apps. I guess I'm spoiled with the Google apps on my GalaxyPhone...Please fix this Amazon!!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is by far the best show to ever be canceled! Just ahead of Stargate Universe...  :-(  Nathan Fillian and crew make this sci-fi show a classic to be watched again and again!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|this app is so stupid I paid for this app and then it undownload I didn't even think that was possible until it happened and get this it redownloaded and paid for it AGAIN!!!!!!!!:-(
B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher books are always good!  Adventuer and good characters as usual.  never a dull moment in these books. Fun to read.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I saw the previews for John Carter last year and as a fan of sci-fi and action flicks I was instantly interested.  While I had heard of the books, I had never actually read them but was told that many of the most respected movies of the genre owe something to these novels.  I missed the opportunity to see this in the theater and when I heard the critics decrying it, I assumed it must have been poorly made.  When it was released on DVD I relegated it to a certain &#34;queue&#34; and figured I would watch it whenever it showed up at my door.<br /><br />The long and short of it is that after I finally watched it, I not only purchased it, I started reading the original Edgar Rice Burroughs novels.  It's a shame there won't be sequels to this as I would love to see how they would have culled more material for the big screen.  While the acting isn't Oscar caliber (as is typical of most action films), the lovely Lynn Collins is captivating as Dejah Thoris.  There is plenty of action throughout but it is PG-13 so young children may be bothered by some of the violence.  I enjoyed the extras as it gave me greater insight into the process involved in bringing this particular story to life as well as the history of the source material.  The visual and audio quality is on par with typical Blu Ray releases.<br /><br />It doesn't matter now, but I think Disney may have had a greater success in marketing this if they would have named it &#34;A Princess of Mars&#34; or just left it as they had originally titled it, &#34;John Carter of Mars.&#34; Between the critics' panning it and the fact that many folks likely haven't heard of this hero from a century ago, it's no small wonder that the movie became one of the biggest box office disappointments in history, a recognition it does not deserve.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read! Can't wait for more. I'll be checking out everything else written by Hugh Howdy now that I've discovered his talent.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It  was a great movie.<br />The grandkids  really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it myself. I like to get movies for my grandchildren.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Love this housing, no more fish eye movies, it has a cover to protect the lens and I could order a red filter to enhance the colors in my video while diving!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Ok I must admit, when I began watching the movie I was a bit confused with what was going on and had a little trouble understanding what was being said. However as the movie progressed things began to clear up and the flow started to take shape. I have seen all the Batman Movies and this to me was not like any that I was accustom to seeing. It was darker, but with more of a human touch, and frankly I thought it moved from action hero type film to action movie. The supervillain Bane, was one mean guy and the story line had some interesting and unexpected twists. Some of the special effects were just well, WOW! I do think the movie could have been shortened a bit and still would have held up. I have no trouble saying \\"thumbs up on this one\\"
B007SGM084|1.0|Love the fact that I was able to download it on my tablet. Sorry I bought all three books. I think all the whoopla about these books were mainly from women that don't have sex lives. My suggestion is to any book by the author Zane... and see what a real page turner is in comparison.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Lee does not disappoint. It's another splendid Reacher caper! Jack is a blunt instrument that yields to nothing. Buyers beware its hard to put this one down!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book.  The first half was suspenseful and kept my attention, but the twist in the middle is the really fun part.  Couldn't put it down.  This is a great summer read.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson is an amazing writer.  He brings you into a new world with it's new magic and rules so quickly you forget that it is a world you didn't already know about.  This is a lovely short story.
B007V65R54|4.0|I haven't finished it yet, but it's changed my perspective. I now consciously try to separate the 'signal' from all the 'noise'. The book is a fascinating read. I kept seeing in words what I have been thinking for years. This should be required reading for any critical thinking class.
B008KE3960|4.0|I've recently received a Kindle Fire (1st gen) and was browsing for a tower defense game to try. I found that Air Patriots went above and beyond my expectations with it's touch interface! Because the 'towers' are mobile, you continually get to interact with them by drawing out their paths or patrol loops and change them as you adapt to the waves of baddies coming through. I dig the game's strategy and intuitive game play with it's engaging use of my tablet's touch-screen.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Puzzles were fun but not too complicated and I felt game was well worth the cost.  Happy to finally play a game that was a casual adventure game without being a hidden object game.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars is brillant.  I can't stop playing!!! Maybe Angry Birds The Hobbit and  Lord of the Rings next hint hint!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|If you like hidden object games this is a good one.  Some areas a difficult, especially in the timed one.  The story is good and the graphics are good.  It is long enough that you don't finish before you have started.  Some of the puzzles are hard.  I have played it through with the timed edition, now I am going to try it with the untimed one.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Mark Wahlberg is great. As a general rule I like most anything he does. Ted (the bear) was excellent as far as appearing to be real and the relationship between the two were a great fit. I think the writing fell short however. The entire storyline was lame.In all fairness it did have a few side splitting hillarius scenes. Ilistened to Wahlbergs interview on Howard Stern, and saw many of the trailers for this movie and was really looking forward to seeing it. Maybe I expected too much.
B00005JPLW|5.0|It motivates me to get off my fat butt and hit the gym.  Gory, but in a way you could assume is historically accurate.  Educational... I learned I never want to get shot with an arrow or have my head cut off.
B006O6F932|5.0|Received on time and just what expected, my daughter´s gonna love it she´s all crazy about Monster High´s stuff !
B000IOM1RI|4.0|There are some great songs on this CD.  There are also some very terrible songs on this CD.  I bought the next Tenacious D CD because I trust in the D. The D will live forever.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|This book is easy to read and takes me back in history. Even if it is fiction. I would recomend this book to my friends.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I got this app for my 8 year old granddaughter.  She loves it!  She can play everyday and enjoys playing for everyone.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Very well developed game  I had a little trouble toward the end but rebooting straightened it out. love the game and just could not put it down  i will purchase any and all games by Alawar  Thanks and keep them coming
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book commanded my full attention from the first page. The arch of the story is perfectly sculptured, and the characters are both lovely and flawed. I absolutely would recommend this title. (Just don't read it in public!)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book just reassured why I always read the book before bidding by what others say. It surpassed all my expectations very well written and easily understood appropriate for all ages.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My son fell in love with movie this year on demand and watched every day so we HAD to buy it. Instant classic
B001EN71DQ|5.0|This movie was bought as part of a order for my Mom, who is a huge fan of the Star Wars series. It arrived in good condition and on time, and was watchable from the start. I will definitely be buying more products from this seller in the future!
B007FH9GA6|3.0|The writing of the mystery portion was excellent.  The movie as a whole had the feeling of the Tom Hanks movie &#34;Road to Perdition&#34;.  Dark, dark, dark...nothing redeeming about the characters...constant disappointment with people...I guess Lisbeths ability to fight her way through what a Godless world has thrown at her, gives me a feeling of respect for her that she has survived the evil things that came her way....but to what end?  I wanted to give it 2 stars but the mystery of Harriet's &#34;murder&#34; was well done in my opinion....don't think I will watch the other two flicks and will probably delete this one....
0439813786|5.0|This book was ordered as part of a bundle of textbooks needed for the Fall 2012 semester. The books arrived within two days due to my Amazon Prime subscription, and were in brand new condition.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Don't mind the Charlotte 's Web reference, this game is fun and WAY addictive!  It's nowhere near mindless, and that is its appeal! Get ready to blow several hours playing this game.e!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't like the subject matter of this book. I don't know why I bought it but I am trying to finish it
B0001YRVN4|5.0|These Star Wars films were bought for my Mom, who is a huge fan of the Star Wars series. I ordered them, and within two days they had arrived at my door! They were in perfect condition and all of the films play as if they were brand new. I am very satisfied with my order, and will continue to order from this seller in the future.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My kids and I really enjoy this game with its wacky blow dryer and the funny faces they make. I love how the eyes watch your every move.<br />Highly recommended.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game with good graphics and storyline.  Fairly easy puzzles.  Wish it was a bit longer but it does have a bonus game once you complete the first game._
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I choose this rating because it is just so helpfup and i really need a portable dictionary . So it really helps you alot and i choose to read this book because i learn and build up my vocabulary.But even though its helpful i already have a dictionary so i dont really need it but its still very helpful .thanks dictionary (muahh)
B004J64QSI|5.0|This DVD is amazingly wonderful!  It has the return of the 25 years ago cast and the current cast sing together!
B000FC12Z0|5.0|As always, an awesome book from Agatha Christie! It has an incredible ending and this is one of the most famous books of hers!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I heard about this on a news program.  Was delighted with Season One.  It was refreshing to watch from the other series I'd been watching, not that they were bad, just a bit violent.  This was a new idea on an old premise, but very intriguing.  Very comfortable and with great stories.  The costumes are magnificent and they wear them more than once to give the Granthams and Crowleys more of a reality.<br /><br />Well Done!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|First. Les Miserable is my favorite musical.  We've been able to see it in Singapore, London, New York, San Francisco and San Jose and have seen the performance almost 20 times.  I listen to the music at least once a month.  Second.  Hugh Jackman is one of my favorite actors.  And, I've even enjoyed some of his singing performances in the past.  So, I was really looking forward to the soundtrack.  It's ok, but just that.  Russell Crowe can't sing.  Jackman sings ok, but is really doing more acting than singing with his voice.  But, thank God, the rest of the cast does an excellent job.<br /><br />Now, I haven't seen the movie yet, so once I can hear all this with the full experience, I may appreciate the soundtrack more.
B0079KGAOY|1.0|I purchased this Lethal Weapon BluRay Collection from you because on the main page it said Steel Book.I didn't get the Steel Book but the reg. blu ray collection. I paid 10.00 more for it than I had to pay from anyone else because it said steel book. I will never purchase anything else from you. I am very upset.
B006ON41FC|1.0|every time you start the game, it flips to upside down even if you flip the . other way... any ideas how to fix it?
B000TETHPQ|5.0|Suicide's debut album still sounds relevant and fresh today. It's great to hear electronic music that still has grit and soul. Many newer artist could learn a thing or two from this album
0812984412|4.0|I bought this from Audible and thought I would really love it.  But.  After the first 2 chapters, I put it down, so to speak, and moved on to another audiobook-Gone With the Wind, talk about shifting gears.  I only resumed reading this because it was my book, I'd paid for it and didn't have any other fresh material on my MP3.  I'm glad that I was forced to do so.  Although I'm not quite done with this book yet, I have found it to be eloquently written, well crafted and intricately thought out and deconstructed after a fashion.  If a reader can get past the first couple of chapters which to me were insanely confusing and frustrating-I think that it is well worth it.  While there are several themes of the weak vs the strong, technology and mankind destroying himself, etc.  As has been pointed out by many, many other reviewers, this is nothing new under the sun.  What makes this book so masterful is the tapestry that Mitchell has woven.  I believe that this book will end up as one of the \\"classics\\" of English literature in a few short decades if not possibly sooner.  As this is not really an original philosophical nor profound work, I would almost cringe to ever see it taught as such, as the book is not *that* great, but when taken as a piece of literary artwork deserves intense appreciation. My interest is now piqued, and I may read more of what this author has written.  Not for everyone.  I think that a person really has to have a love of cunning story telling and patience to embrace this.  I look forward to finishing it, but not a book that I'll be recommending to very many of my friends.  Not at all to say that this is super highbrow lit (I didn't feel that it raised my IQ one iota) but I'm pretty sure that only a bare handful of people I know would enjoy this because of the style and less of the subject matter.  In some ways, this book reminds me of some of Philip K. Dick's writings, but I feel that Dick was a far more accessible author and is therefore more widely read.  I've enjoyed every step of my journey on the Atlas so far.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This product is good in my opinion, I do not understand why this unit and the Us power connecter do not come together.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|I love the CD. IT arrived as promised. It's a wonder I haven't worn it out already!! I need more RUFUS!!!
B005HSL626|3.0|I like this game a lot it's a blast and is addictive. I don't like the fact that it would stop and go black screen on me all the time right in the middle of a great run too!
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I have audible and book.  I found it easier to read the book.  Maybe it was the actors that put me off.  The different voices and acting and over acting changed the feeling of the story.  The actual story is good and holds up to todays writing on similar themes.<br />Overall I thought the story was very drawn out, maybe an abridged version would have got to the point sooner.
B00A2FSTC4|4.0|I enjoy this sort of movie, meaning sci-fi futuristic strangeness. I like the action and have always watched it when replayed on some cable channel and finally got tired of the commericals and decided to buy a copy for myself.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I was hoping this would be funny, even a little bit funny. A lousy film- no redeemable qualities other than it does end at some point.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Don't like it don't get it maybe I'm old school but it was like texting and waiting for the response of someone who's ignoring you.
B001QB5S3G|3.0|ok, but a bit depressing. If you want to watch something unbelievably beautiful but sad then this is for you.
B008XG1X18|3.0|It's fun to check out all my friends Pinterest. I like the DIY's. Otherwise I'm not sure why I should go to the site.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Mrs Collins has done the unthinkable with this book! Her words have infiltrated my sleep. Her characters have become my loved ones. Katniss' emotions have become my own. No book has ever been able to do what The Hunger Games & Catching Fire have done to me. My chest still hurts from the thrashing & pounding it sustained while reading. I have found an inexplicable and all-consuming love affair...so much so that I'm afraid to read the last book & let it all come to an end...
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I feel like there is so much info they still left out.  Other than that it was of great help only in formats.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl - what a thriller!  I could not put this book down!  Recommended by a friend.  I did not read the description as I find it more surprising.  My thoughts took left turns and right turns and did 360's and by the end of the book, I couldn't pull my jaw off the floor!  READ IT!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all of these on my kindle fire and I was happy I bought this trilogy. Once I was finished with the first I could roll right into the second one with no wait time. Perfect for me!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Enjoy!<br />Fun game even if you do need cash.<br />I like that the game autoruns whilw you are away. Going to attempt to play without it costing me.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think my little pony is an awesome game and an awesome movie !what I think it needs is they should look exactly like the animated movie, not all trying-to-be-all-3D-ish. If you know what I mean.well I hope our enjoy this game, it is truly awesome!!!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Don't waste your time or money.  Worst of the Resident evil movies by far.  Barely a plot to the movie.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Maybe I'm too old for kids shows?  Naaaw.  UP was one of my faves and Pumba's my BFF.  This was an okay movie - just not one that I'll bother to recommend to friends, for their kids, or other adults who still enjoy kids movies.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like angry birds so i thought i'd really like going through space with  the pigs, the space ships neet nooks and cranneys
006074748X|5.0|I read this book for the first time in a Reader's Digest Condensed Book's version and have been hoping ever since to find it in the &#34;real&#34; version.  Reader's Digest is GREAT ... but one always wonders.  As a horse lover, this book particularly appealed to me.  A nice, relaxing read.  Keeps one engaged; however, there's no horrible, worrisome drama to give one nightmares.  A super story.  If you don't know anything about Lippizaners and and the Spanish Riding School, may I suggest that you do what I do and Google things in books that you aren't familiar with.  I have pretty much given up reading books without my computer at my side.  Too much to learn!!!  I love looking up places, foods, and etc.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Very condensed and to the point. Easy to understand and I found some good suggestions.<br />Definitely recommend this book to young people and to those who need to brush up on social skills.
0205313426|5.0|I've read this book twice now and it's one of those books that should be read every few years. The breavity and concise manner that this book is written should be a model for all of us that have to write for a living. Whether you are writing reports or emails this book will help you get your point across more quickly and effectively. Although it was written many years ago it is still amazingly appropriate for today's writers. In summary, one of the most useful and valuable books anyone could read and use.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|“Suddenly it's here”, and....Wow!  Despite the mixed reviews that this CD is getting, I think that this is by far the best performance of many of these songs.  The idea of singing live has given the music new meaning- and new life.  It’s raw and emotional, and so believable you feel like you’re in the story!  It's like listening to a completely new soundtrack- you hear every word like you never have before.  Every song will come alive here.  They are more than just songs: they are stories, masterfully acted, vividly told and sung better than ever before.  Here is a synopsis of each track:<br /><br /> &#34;Look Down&#34;- This is the best recording that’s been done of this song.  The singing is much more gritty here than previous recordings- and the new orchestration is *amazing*. But...it ends slightly sooner here than it has before- it’s not the whole song.<br /><br /> &#34;The Bishop&#34;- This is more an excerpt of audio from the movie than a song, but it’s well done.<br /><br /> &#34;Valjean's Soliloquy&#34;- A great example of what singing live can do for a song!  Hugh Jackman is amazing at portraying the inward struggle of Valjean at this point- Hugo would be proud.  The new orchestrations here are amazing, too!<br /><br /> &#34;At the End of the Day&#34;- This song is not quite what I hoped it would be.  Although the opening few moments are amazing, this performance digresses towards the end.<br /><br /> &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34;- WOW! It is hard to write a review worthy of this amazing performance of Hathaway's part. This is beyond a doubt the best recording of this song ever done.  As Hathaway put it: &#34;There seemed to be something selfish about going for the pretty version.&#34;  The product?  A haunting and emotional performance- without the flashy Broadway singing that so often almost negates the heartrending words of this song.  It is so beautiful, you won't have dry eyes by then end.  The whole CD is worth getting if only for this song.<br /><br /> &#34;The Confrontation&#34;- The singing for Javert's part makes this a lot less powerful than what it could have been, though not a bad performance.<br /><br /> &#34;Castle On a Cloud&#34;- Amazing singing on the part of Isabelle Allen!  The orchestrations here are quite good, too.  Once again, it’s not the whole song.<br /><br /> &#34;Master of the House&#34;- The duet here between Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter is awesome- and hilarious!  As usual we hear comical sound effects from the guests at the inn.  But new hear is singers that actually take the trouble to act as well as they sing- making this head and shoulders better than previous recordings.  Another amazing product of live singing.  Once again the new orchestration here really worked well- it’s definitely a highlight.<br /><br /> &#34;Suddenly&#34;- Okay, it's not every day that a song is added to a production 20 plus years after its original release and actually blends and even compliments the story.  But it’s been done here:  and not only is it good, but it’s just as good as the best of Les Mis.  It’s sung by Valjean just after he gets Cosette, and feels something he never knew till then: love.  Beautiful and vivid, this song is a tear-jerker.  And the singing!  Outstanding!<br /><br /> &#34;Stars&#34;- I was disappointed in this one.  The singing is not nearly as powerful as it could be and the orchestration is lacking.  I was sad about this- I really wanted it to be good, but alas...<br /><br /> &#34;ABC Cafe/Red and Black&#34;- This is really a good recording.  Great singing and acting on the part of both Redmayne and Tveit.  Here, too, the song is cut short on both ends, and some in the middle.<br /><br /> &#34;In My Life- A Heart Full of Love&#34;- This beautiful rendition of this song is easily one of the best I have heard.  The singing is beautiful.  But once again, another song missing music.<br /><br /> &#34;On My Own&#34;- A Beautiful performance by Samantha Barks.  Way more emotional than the other versions that I heard.  She is an amazing Eponine!  Bravo!<br /><br /> &#34;One Day More&#34;- Epic!  The amazing singing, new orchestrations, and powerful performance of the entire cast make it the highlight of the entire CD- and probably the film, too!  Another smashing hit!<br /><br /> &#34;Drink With Me&#34;- Complete with sound effects from the live recording (good thing?) this is actually pretty well done- much better than both the London and Complete Symphonic recordings, in my opinion (as long as you are okay with the extra sounds.)  Also slightly cut short.<br /><br /> &#34;Bring Him Home&#34;- This one was kind of disappointing to me.  I am not sure if it was just not meant for Jackman's voice, or it is just the performance its self, but I was not as pleased with this one.  However, that’s not to say it's not good, just not exceptional.<br /><br /> &#34;The Final Battle&#34;- This one is the only score that we get on this CD.  Beginning with the motif at the beginning of 'Red and Black' in the brass, it quickly progresses into an epic orchestral score, complete with reprises of many themes heard throughout the latter part of the musical.  It culminates with a reprise of the main theme to &#34;Red and Black&#34; before ending with a haunting reprise in the strings of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34;.  Masterfully composed and orchestrated, with sound effects  rarely pulled off in musical score with this kind of skill, I was blown away by this one:  what an experience!  Hopefully this is only the beginning of more great score to come.<br /><br /> &#34;Javert’s Suicide&#34;- This one’s not quite what it could have been had the singing been more intense, but still pretty good.<br /><br /> &#34;Empty Chairs and Empty Tables&#34;- Much better than any of the other recordings, this is another song that really benefited from the live singing.  I am not sure if this song has been edited for the movie, or if they, once again, just pulled out music from the song we will see on screen- also missing music.<br /><br /> &#34;Epilogue&#34;- Great ending to a great story!  The singing is great- although some music has been edited from the front half.<br /><br /> The only thing that upset me about this recording is that &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#34;, &#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34;, and &#34;Who am I&#34; are not included.  However, I’m sure &#34;at the end of the day&#34; they will end up releasing a more complete soundtrack, which will undoubtedly include some of those excluded songs and excluded parts of songs... and maybe more score!  For being a compilation of highlights, this is great.  Bravo, Mackintosh!
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Flat.  No character or plot development.  Just chase scene after chase scene - and very predictable.  Main character needs something to survive, they get it while being chased, technology wizardry, couple happily together in the middle of nowhere.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was suspenseful and funny [in spots].  I loved it so much I loaned it to my daughter and am now going to loan it to my friend who likes stories like this.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I don't usually read legal books, but I gave this a shot based on good reviews.  It did not disappoint.  This book is so well written, and so compelling, that I did not want to put it down.  I finished it in 4 days.  I would recommend it to anyone. This is the first book I have read from this author but I will definitely be looking for his other books.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|this was an electronic order that was for an I PAD<br />great movie for every age<br />watch again and again<br />cheaper than DVD too
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I do not much care for first person narrations, however this trilogy was quite interesting. What I found most redeeming of the first person point of view is how realistic the world was. How realistic the limits of these children werre in the books and their progression as you went through the books. Even the ending was realistic yet happy and though it didn't end the way I thought it would, I was happily surprised and not found cheated. It certainly was a story needed telling in whole and bravo, it was an overall good one. I commend the author for not going overboard and making her characters superhuman with no consequences on mind and body. Also, for choosing the right man for her. Bravo.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Brisinger by Christopher Paolini is Awesome, what is the name of the 4th book. I want it! Please contact me
B008JF8O9M|1.0|When trying to download full version said it didn't work with my kindle. Only sample did for one print!! Not happy!! Tried and tried!!!
0385736002|5.0|I love the mythology in Michael Scott Alchemyst series. He weaves many mythologies into this series and makes an exciting credible world out of it. I wish more people would read this series. It is far better than Harry Potter and on par with Hunger Games as good novels for teens/preteens. It hasn't gotten the notice that it deserves. It is a brilliant series. Try it!
B005IQZB14|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but it was not a favorite. Her description of the scenery was very good, and the characters seemed very real.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I was extremely impressed by the book to movie translation. The movie makers actually added in scenes that gave greater meaning to the story. A few changes bugged me, but overall, very impressive. Great cast who played their respective roles wonderfully! Can't wait for Catching Fire!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not bad game play. I'm not real good at most games but I have had a pretty good time figuring out these.  great gameplay for old and young alike.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Very , very good book,everybody suppose to read this book to try understand why so many peoples don't believe in god.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have got to admit the app's adds are a little annoying. That is the reason I took one star off. But other than that the app was great. I have a kindle fire and this app has been great with it! I really do enjoy this app and recommend it.<br />&asymp;WARNING&asymp;Some of the games are cheesy!!!
B007URCTOG|5.0|I was dissapointed in the movie because it did not go with the true story of the book. The movie was ok.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|if your into your super heors like i am this is the one to own. the movie has everything and much more.
B0050C863G|3.0|I rarely not finish a book but this is what happened with this book. The tips to meditate were good and you get them early in the book and that was sufficient for me. I was bored and aannoyed by his personnal life stories.
B005HSL626|5.0|Im addicted! :). I have this game on my phone and kindle! I play it more than any game. Its fun
B00684J49U|5.0|Thank you to Shonda Rines for this amazing serial! it is full with real life emotions and experiences!!! I LOVE IT!!
B00846F1YW|2.0|I can't get past chapter thirteen.  There is a glitch in the game. I've contacted them by email and they're working on it.  It's a fun game that I want to finish.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Got me all refreshed for the new season and the dvd's where new and simple and easy to navigate. Love this show
B00563M11M|4.0|I always enjoy Vimes & this book didn't disappoint at all!! I'd recommend it to all Discworld fans everywhere. :-)
B007FEZQF8|4.0|As a longtime fan of comics (though no longer collecting) this has proven to be one amazing title.<br /><br />The artwork, simplistic in its lack of color is amazing. On par with the classic TMNT or the original crow. Many of the full page panels had me pausing in the story to appreciate the art.<br /><br />I've been aware of this title for quite some time, and have been a fan of the AMC series, which is why I give this volume (and, for that matter, Volume 2) only four stars.<br /><br />Shane did not play a very large role in the comic. Which was disappointing.  His presence, in the series, allowed Rick to be a much purer hero early on. Shane was the protagonist, freeing Rick to be the hero we needed him to be early on. Without Shane Rick has to play both roles.<br /><br />So, great story, amazing art, and mostly fantastic character development. If only the AMC writer who utilized Shane' s  character had been a voice for the comic. It would have been a 5 star.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This was an interesting novelty for about five seconds, after that - useless, even more useless than it was intended to be.
0321885112|5.0|The primary reason I bought this book was to get into drawing. All my life I've told myself I can't draw. After reading this book and watching the videos, I was drawing faces, buildings and everyday objects. I was quite surprised at the progress I had made in 2 days. I can draw, after all.<br /><br />I want to use Sketchnotes for travel notes -- making notes about places I've visited, impressions of food markets, monuments, churches, etc. Although the point of the book is to get you to make great notes when you attend a conference, you can use the skills you learned to make notes about anything. For people who keep diaries, like me, it's a fun and creative way to record thoughts, feelings and impressions using drawings instead of words. It makes a diary much more interesting to read.<br /><br />I love this book because it is beautifully done -- thick paper, gorgeous drawings. The flow of the lessons is easy to follow and makes a lot of sense. This is one of the best books I have ever bought. The video clips are well done, very professional and easy to follow. They do add to the learning process and provide you a good overview of what's in the book. The book deepens your understanding of Sketchnotes and allows you to practice further.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game does a great job of holding your interest while being pretty simple, straightforward play. Many different objectives and stuff to buy in the stash make this worth playing for hours.
030788743X|5.0|This is a must read. Well written, nearly perfect. I never got tired of the theme, cared for the people. I wish that I had discovered this book 10 years from now so that there would be more from the author to read.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|If you like good movie do not watch this one. You will never get these 2 hours of your life back.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|This was a fantastic read from an individual whos career I've followed since I first the video for \\"Wake-up Dead\\" on MTV Headbangers Ball. A must for any fan of the band. I have every album by the band and there was nothing better than reading this book while having the whole discography playing on shuffle mode.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I agree with other reviewers that this product has the worst audio reproduction I have ever heard.  It is full of distortion and does not have any good quality.  I will keep it and may use it for voice only amplification but cannot listen to music with it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John's stories are a &#34;Graet Escape&#34; for me from a world of strong rules and day to day troubles. He makes us wish we were his characters. This is another example of this. Excellent story, highly recommended.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It was great that the language was not profane and the violence did not show a lot of gore.  PG13 was very good.<br />I watched the movie in parts on my Kindle, Roku and Blu Ray player.  The Blu Ray was the best.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app. I choose to check weather. Also would recommend to other users. Doesn't need any improvements. Give it a ++++
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Kept my attention to the, disappointingly abrupt, end. I did not guess the resolution and all I'll give away is that Missourians are weird.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Would recommend app to others. Great recipes and ease of use. Can't see where it needs any improvement in app
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good book with lots of suspense. Good work on Tellowknife history and about diamond exploration. Good work also on inuit culture.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I love weather apps. This one disappointed me. I uninstalled it because I knew I'd never use it. The data is so basic. Nothing special. I could not find a weather map, although the description said there was one. If you want a great weather app, just buy Weather Bug or Weather Bug Elite. I am quite well served by those.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Recently watched this wonderful story,we forget that a dog has emotions too, so faithful,loving and always there.<br />They know when we are sad and need comfort. I have experienced this with 2 of my dogs,they have passed on but never forgotten. we need more family films like this.Richard Gere was excellent. thanks again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to read, worth the value, good to carry on tablet.  recommended for travel version. easy download, fair to read
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Phillip sounds like a young Bruce Springsteen! Love this CD! Really great! I love listening to this on my way to work!
B000001IQH|5.0|I bought this album for a penny and it is worth much more than that. I highly recommend this album.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|From the outset, this book had me turning from page to page until I came to the end.  The story is well-crafted and kept me engaged the entire time.  The writer does an outstanding job of attending to the nuances that are present when someone is dying.  Twisted my heart and gave me hope, both at the same time.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Many times, when Hollywood makes a sequel to a hit movie, they don't have original ideas. This is soooo different! The movie is fresh, exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat! The villan is especially scary in a disturbing way - and Josh Brolin is the younger embodiment of Tommy Lee Jones! It does not disappoint!!
B007FTZDN8|1.0|The idea of TED conferences is very appealing to me.  It doesn't matter how appealing the concept is when I can't download some of the lectures.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This was a good read.<br /><br />It did not use as much advanced technology as previous Clancy books did for their time.
0307744434|5.0|This book is very well written, and has an unexpected ending and plot twist. Finally a story that has not been told yet. I got this book as a gift after the author of shiver recommended it. I wasnt disappointed.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Amazing adventure for kids! This is the best game ever for kids or adults in the app world for kindle fire. Highly recommended. 5 out of 5 stars for this one :)
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I tried reinstalling it tthree times .  It will not play in a droid razor maxx,it just keeps restarting.  Has anyone else had this problem?  It needs zero stars at this point.
B004A7OQKY|5.0|This is my first review of a work-out video, but I had to give this 5 stars. Erin is awesome! I'm 27 weeks along with my first pregnancy. Before I became pregnant I was working out about 6 days per week, but my first trimester was really hard. I stopped working out all together and lost my motivation. My second trimester has been much better and I'm trying to build that strength back up. This video will definitely help!<br /><br />What I love about it:<br />- I love that its in Erin's home and that she uses coffee tables and couches for some stretches and workout moves<br />- Erin is both motivating and soothing at the same time<br />- None of the workouts felt like I was putting myself at risk<br />- I was definitely challenged!<br />- It was fun, I don't think I'll get bored with it before its delivery time!<br /><br />The first section is about 35 minutes long which is perfect for me. The second set is done with a partner which I have yet to try - but it looks fun too!
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I liked most of the songs, and I only buy a CD if I like 4 or more of the songs.
B00A757EFW|5.0|It's a old time classic  I love it. Me and and wife love it and can't get enough of it
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is great and interactive. I really love to draw all the stuff. This game is a bit challenging, but it is very fun.
B0086700CM|4.0|I'm so glad that temple run is out for the kindle but its harder with it being bigger then the ipod or iphone. but for the most part great
B007T99ENE|4.0|I enjoyed this - an easy fun read . Rather lighter in themes than Atonement and some of his others. I am not absolutely sure about the interpolated short stories attributed to the character who is the subject of covert surveillance by British Intelligence in the 1960's. I believe they are based on some of the author's own early work. Is this cheating?  The jury is out, I guess. His heroine is fun though naive, and as irritatingly smug as her career path suggests!
B008XG1X18|5.0|My niece badgered me until I finally joined Pinterest.  I have found so wonderful recipes and ideas since joining about 2 weeks ago.  this is a nice app if you are stuck for an idea for just about anything as they have a great variety.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Best soundtrack and movie,i haven't stopped listening to it since I have got it,I'm obsessed.<br />Run,don't walk,to the nearest amazon near you.
B009329Y30|3.0|I really can't rate this movie. I purchased it for my Kindle to take on vacation, but did not get to watch it before the rental expired.
0823003035|5.0|This is a beautiful book! I wasnt sure what to expect or the shape it was in. When i saw it it was more than i had in mind! Cannot wait to get drawing!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't get enough of this show. As soon as one is episode is done I need to turn on the next one.
0525958002|3.0|I loved Duran Duran, and John Taylor was my favorite, so I was expecting to LOVE this book, but oddly I found it to be very boring. He did have a co-writer, so maybe the book was written by the co-writer? As others have said, its detached and unemotional and doesn't spill the beans on anything (except his rampant cocaine use). Even his love relationships get only a few bland sentences here and there. He also doesn't go into any detail about Roger, Andy, Simon or Nick. I was wondering what their personalities are behind-the-scenes. Reading this made me wonder if John is some kind of soulless narcissist? Ditto the reviewer who was disturbed to reach the last page of acknowledgements to find out that John thanks Roger, Simon and Nick for being in Duran Duran with him - leaving out Andy. I had to reread that a few times to be sure I didn't miss something! What sort of hatred does he have for Andy that he refused to include him? He does redeem himself a bit in the last few chapters, about his dad's death and his time in rehab.
B000G28IZ6|5.0|The fit is excellent. Classic styling, good color, nice quality. Great purchase. I would recommend to all old school friends.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a very useful app.  I use it all of the time.  Here are seven words for the minimum.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game to play and I am sure others will enjoy it. Keeps you thinking of your next tradegy move.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is the best game ever made in history!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay soho soho soho
B0099116AY|1.0|First, let me say that this is not a movie I would be drawn to rent or buy.  That being said, I checked this film out at my local library thinking it might be entertaining.  Boy was I wrong!  Most of this film is devoted to Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones' characters exploring intimacy with one another to salvage their marriage that's in the dumps.  I can't begin to express how uncomfortable I was in seeing these aging stars try to develop chemistry with one another.  It was pathetic at best and not something, as a viewer that's enticing to see.  I'd much rather watch a love story with much younger stars like the upcoming Nicholas Sparks film adaption of the novel Safe Haven.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the show and its funny to go back and watch the first season and the dynamic of the characters then compared to the current season.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I have to say that Persona 4 Golden is the best game in the Persona line up so far. Also was the reason I bought my Vita.
B009VL28W2|3.0|Short and to the point: the video quality is atrocious for a blu-ray; it looks like a YouTube video upscaled to blu-ray resolution.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|good movie. less action than the original but great modern day twist. It definately keeps you guessing through out the movie.
B009ZE27US|5.0|If you don't like it then there is a little button that says 'Remove from device' go click it instead if complaining (;
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Of course, they are Kindle Books, made for Kindle readers, but the app is universal. The free book collection is great and extensive. I often find the book I am looking for, for a reasonable price. Lists my collections well.<br /><br />I love it.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Such an amazing woman and a beautify written piece of life. Elizabeth Gilbert takes you with her through the pain an growth that's more than a book it's a guide for any woman who is looking for some stability after heartbreak. Gilbert has a way with words that makes this book hard to put down. I'm off to buy all of her books!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm is very cool and simple. It wasn't a problem at all and I think I'm gonna keep this alarm for a while. I recommend this for all those who aren't looking for something too complicated or just some dumb plain ol' alarm clock although I wish they would allow you to play your own music that's on your kindle for the alarm music.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Really wanted to get this on dvd. The price was perfect and the DVD came unscratched and in perfect condition. Case was perfect as well. Would buy from here again.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Everything she writes is good. This is verycompelling because is brings back concerns about conflicting feelings regarding a family members involvement in the deaths of other family members.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I found this book to be an easy and fun read.  Only the ending pulled down the rating.  The cast of characters were well thought out and developed.  While the book ended with a setup for a sequel, I was disappointed by the ending relative to the first 95%.  If you like fantasy with some thriller mixed in, I would whole heartedly recommend this book.  I enjoyed Ransom Rigg's literary style and look forward to the upcoming  sequel
B0002NRRAG|5.0|where did they find her - back in the 40's? she's better than ella!  a cross between billie and rosemary. what a gift of voice.
B001706I5I|5.0|I purchased this so my grandkids can watch it.  I love it!  It's a fun movie for everyone to see.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I enjoyed this novel which is written in much the same style as many Grisham books. The pace is good, the characters are real and there is a sense that not all is as it seems. There are enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. It is not Grisham's best book but it certainly engaged, entertained and is worth a read.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I use a large (1.7MB) spreadsheet regularly for my business.  (It happens to have several tabs and is macro-enabled - even though OSP6 doesn't yet handle macros.)  I originally purchased OfficeSuite Pro 6 for my Kindle Fire (1st Generation), but it wouldn't handle my spreadsheet.  I systematically went through the other productivity apps, as well.  No dice!  But, I just upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD with 32GB and much to my pleasure and wonder - it works!  Finally, a productivity pack that handles the big stuff.  Since I had already purchased the other apps, I also loaded and attempted my spreadsheet on the HD with them, but they still can't handle it.  Whatever the difference is, know that OfficeSuite Professional 6 is the productivity suite for the serious professional who wants the convenience and features of the Kindle Fire HD-32GB!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I want the UN-edited directors cut just like the original Alien, and Aliens. Ridley did this film a huge disservice on the cutting room floor.
B00821OW8K|5.0|This series is amazing....I found it while home with the flu and watched season 1 & 2 back to back. One of the BEST science fiction television series to come along in a very long time. The story line is believable and the effects are truly amazing....can't wait for season 3.
B006V3UMB2|4.0|I bought this book for a college course.  It's pretty good.  You have to understand the language that is being spoken, but it's very well written.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Wasn't sure about another \\" high school musical\\", but this cast turned a possible dud into an actual comedy. This film has some sexual underlying content but if you can get through prime time tv this is no problem for the whole family.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|This CD has been the best purchase all year. I listen to it often~ to work, at work, from work: this Album is a masterpiece!
B008G59IKO|2.0|Uno was such a great & powerful album.  So much buildup, everyone couldn't wait for the trilogy to begin!  And then came Dos...what a letdown.  No huge release, no big news, just an extremely sub-par album that trickled into existance.  The whole thing is just one big filler - no good songs - like they just wanted a break between Uno & Tre (which also rocks!).  Hopefully they'll skip over this album on their 2013 tour.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This thing is wonderful! It's fast, powerful, and accomplishes everything I throw at it with ease. The cooler that comes with it is also wonderful, and should be installed if an aftermarket CPU-Cooler isn't readily available.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is hella fun! At first, I didn't get very far in the game because I didn't realize that there are times when you actually have to tilt your device. Once I figured that out, I was on the road to addiction! I've used the game with and without a stylus...seem a lot easier with a stylus, but that might be just me! Either way, get the game and have a hella good time!
B0000X61VE|5.0|Great workout!  I find it just challenging enough to be tough and effective, yet I can complete the entire workout which makes me feel confident!  Great exercise video!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun, witty, and sexy story! Waking Up Married was a page turner that I loved!! I'm recommending this to all my friends!
0525953728|5.0|the book is very good! it's really exciting to read it! the writer talks about his experience as a SEAL
B0015AARJI|4.0|its the mandatory bought to the ps3 for playing with others partners good autonmy of the battery despite to have micro usb 2
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and game play. Story is  interesting love all the g5games they are awesome. Definitely recommend this game.worth the money for sure.<br /><br />Wendella
B002ZG98UK|4.0|if you want to enjoy a real 3d experience in your home bought it because there isnt best movie that have many 3d effects like this
B0061PEAUY|5.0|If you like the TV seris, ' Bones' then you will love all of the Temperance Brennan series of books.  The characters and their personalities, are even better in the books than in Bones.  You will love the friends you will meet in these books!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman are outstanding in this movie. The story is very moving. Recommended viewing for anyone wanting to understand Nelson Mandela and South America a little better.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Sequels are rarely better than the original, but this is satisfactory. Who would of thought the same actor who plays a sleazy tabloid journalist in Mr. Deeds could do so well as the calculating Professor Moriarty? Indeed. Still not sure why Noomi Rapace is in movies, so many other qualified actresses out there. Then again the only other movie I've seen her in is Prometheus...<br /><br />Nevertheless. Plenty of entertainment, looking forward to the next Sherlock installment.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I suggest that everyone should see this movie. Autism is extremely common these days. If you know anyone with it, you MUST see this. Dr. Temple Grandin is truly amazing. Claire Danes is outstanding. The movie is funny, sad and informative.<br />[[ASIN:193527421X The Way I See It, Revised and Expanded 2nd Edition: A Personal Look at Autism and Asperger's]]<br />[[ASIN:0307739589 Thinking in Pictures, Expanded Edition: My Life with Autism (Vintage)]]
B007MDB548|4.0|Our whole family enjoys this series. Crisp, beautiful, animation paired with good story and consistent voice acting. Never condescending or preachy, just quality entertainment. Recommended.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|What's the issue? You accidentally deleted it on DVR and you have a strange craving to see this movie again? Because you've obviously seen this movie, right? If not, please stop reading reviews, scroll up, and purchase this movie. It's an American Christmas classic, for Pete's sake. You're better than that.
B001ILFUD2|4.0|I always loved this movie from when my kids were little, and now when my friend had a baby boy that she named Oliver, I thought it would be great to give him a 'namesake' DVD to watch when he grows up.  Just what I wanted.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This classic warms the heart through the ages. It's fun to be transported back to an earlier age and realize that the spirit of Christmas is the same.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the orgeon trail alone so when they turned into one of these games BOOM best freaking game EVER!!!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for one of my sons because he loves \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" and I knew he would enjoy this.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I played this on my friends I pad and I loved it. I searched for it on the app sore for months and it finally came. I played it for a while then found it was just as good as the ipad version. GET THIS GAME IF YOU CAN.
B003498SDA|5.0|I bought \\"Collateral\\" for one of my sons for a Christmas present. He really liked the movie so did I.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I think this is a great movie for yourself and your family to watch together.  It brings back the real meaning of Christmas.  Loved it.  Saw it in 3D at the movies and it was even better.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I bought Rise of the Planet of Apes as a Christmas present for one of my sons. He really enjoyed the movie when he saw it at the theater, so I know he will like having his own copy to watch when he wants.
B008MM9630|4.0|Just got it but so far I like it enspecially since I can take it on the go.  Cant wait till I get my land bigger
B00447L4JG|5.0|Classic Tim Burton, and if you love his movies, this is a &#34;must have&#34;.  This is my favorite of his films thus far.
1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan keeps me on tenderhooks, waiting for the next books in the series. I have read all of his Percy Jackson/Gods of Olympus series, and they just keep getting better.
B008MC175A|5.0|Love the Blueray disks for HD quality and clarity.  Could there be any more X-Men/Women in the near future?  Hope so.......
0785139168|5.0|Jane Austin's stories, are delightfully captured by the artists from Marvel. Delightful artwork and dialogue bring to the readers a great rendition of this classic tale.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|It sounds just like the movie - the next best thing, until it comes out on DVD! A lot of ambiance/instrumental music, but it's lovely to listen to while reading or typing a review. :)
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Well since I have read all the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child on my Kindle Fire you must know that he is one of my favorite authors. I do recommend  ALL of Lee Child books. Once you start you can not stop. I have read one a day until I just finished Wanted Man.....Love, love, love
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|good, great, awesome, off the hook, exciting, adventuress, amazingly awesome, amazing, challenging, hard work, fun, funny, funky, exploring, mysterious, creative
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not put it down, finished in a day. Love Sylvia Day and can't wait much longer for Entwined in you.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game!  not too hard, not too easy!  payed to play but worth it in the end.  if you like this kind of game give it a try.
B00004SZWD|5.0|My grandmother remarried in 1987 and the wedding song was \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You.\\"  I was a little kid but ran out of the ballroom as soon as I heard it.  I'm not sure if I like the song much more today.  For years, I thought of Stevie Wonder based on that song and a few others like Part-Time Lover.  Then I decided to get this album since it was so acclaimed.  Boy did I do a 180 on Stevie Wonder.  This album made me such a fan that I bought Innervisions and Talking Book immediately.  And as great as those albums are, I love Songs in the Key of Life the best.  I can only imagine the joy that came through the people making this album, similar to what it must have been like when The Beach Boys recorded Pet Sounds.  Music is rarely so good on so many tracks.  And while Stevie had incredible musicians as backups, it is the man himself that can create this magic.  Take Summer Soft, a challenging vocal to get right.  There is a video on YouTube of India.Arie singing that song and Stevie Wonder in the audience swaying to the music.  Now, India.Arie can sing, but she is like karaoke hour compared to the original version.  And that's just one song.<br /><br />This album gets high praise from Rolling Stone to major recording artists.  And why not?  It's simply one of the very best albums that will ever be made.  I hope your purchased version nails the recording.  Like a steak, you want it cooked perfectly right and not too rare nor well done.
B0076DELIG|5.0|When ever I find Michael Connelly  has a new novel being published, I immediately pre-order it.  I DEVOUR his books and this A BLACK BOX was most delicious.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|This game is a fun diversion and I enjoy playing it, but some may get bored after so many levels where all you have to do is find hidden objects. I would appreciate more of the puzzle boards. Still, it's fun.<br /><br />The graphics are very nice and overall the game plays well. However, I have the 8.9\\" kindle fire and find that I have to hold it right up to my face to see some of the tiny objects hidden in the dark, crowded rooms. Pinch to zoom would be an extremely welcome addition.<br /><br />However, I imagine that if pinch to zoom were enabled, you would get penalized for random taps every time you used it. The penalty for random taps is another flaw in this game. You get penalized even if you are tapping on a hidden object but don't hit it \\"just right.\\"<br /><br />Also, there's one board where you're in a dark room and have to move a circle of light around to find anything, and anytime you touch the light to move it you get a random tap. This adds up to a lot of penalties and is annoying.<br /><br />Overall, it's a fun game for the casual gamer and will keep you occupied for quite awhile, but there are some minor annoyances during gameplay.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|The songs are great, ABBA's album tracks, most which I had never heard before, are very strong. Listening to each album doesn't feel like a few hits and a bunch of filler. Each album is consistent and listenable from start to finish. Very few songs are lemons.<br /><br />Each album is housed in a cardboard replica of the original album, with front and back artwork. Nothing fancy, but it works. Also included is an informative booklet covering all the albums, including track listings and an essay.<br /><br />I have a burning question though: I think one song is missing, \\"Put on Your White Sombrero,\\" which I heard on the radio a few times. A minor quibble, I love this box set.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|i rented this earlier on my xbox 360 because I recently got xbox live and wanted to test out the amazon instant video app on the 360, anyways, the point is this movie is exactly what I needed after the horrible week i've had.  this movie had me dying from laughing so hard, my eyes kept watering it was unreal.  i'm from the middle east i grew up in New York and my parents along with my brothers are completely muslim.  i converted to agnosticism many years ago, but I digress.  the reason why I put all of that out there is because of what i'm going to say next.  people seriously  need to get over the entire racism garbage, when are people going to realize we are ONE race called the human race? this movie is beyond hysterical.  you just have to get over yourself to actually enjoy it.  everyone seems so worried about what's offensive and what isn't, instead of just enjoying life to the fullest every single moment.  i HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this  movie if you're looking to laugh and have fun.  easy 5 stars!!! and god bless!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This trilogy is really well done.  Grabs you from the start, and keeps you wondering what will finally happen to the main characters throughout.  I love books that make you lose track of time, and make you wish your day away because you want to get back to the book to find out what happens next.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Much better than the last few Tom Clancy books.  While not as detailed or intricate as his early novels, this is an enjoyable read.
B0030B624E|5.0|Man I love this show. Wish I had the DVD but a few bucks to get it on my amazon account isn't bad. Great to watch through the Roku box!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Just as others have posted, it only shows the first 10 feeds.  I don't like that they made that decision for me.  If I want to look at older posts I should be able to.
B002NQ3AAQ|4.0|A very good movie to watch with your children - not just for the cultural differences for an American kid, but the similarities in anyone having an uphill struggle to pursue a dream. A young boy in a tough Irish neighborhood dreams of the unconventional - to dance. He hides his desires from everyone, especially his father, but is found out and suffers for it. The story is told with touching acting, and yet, there is a huge goof you rarely see, when the camera caught the boom mike in the shot and no one edited it out or reshot it. Bargain basement filming techniques, I guess. However, as much as it glaringly makes the viewer &#34;fall out of the picture&#34; and remember it is only a movie, the story is still one I would recommend highly for anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Satisfying read. Can't wait to finish this review so I can start book three! Ah-maz-img book, terrific story! Love it!
1452110581|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this view of the world from a cat's perspective. For me today, it was &#34;I could vomit on this&#34; .
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book. Alot about the history of apple, but mostly about him. I can't put its down. It's s great book
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I like this hidden object game. It looks like they added the zoom feature recently, and that helps a lot. You have to be careful that it doesn't register too many false taps when you move the zoomed screen around. Put your finger on it and keep it there as much as possible so you aren't penalized.
B004LRORES|1.0|Little Women begins the 3-book saga of four sisters and mother. Their father is off at war and this tale tells of their growing up in the mid 19th century.<br /><br />The girls and their \\"Marmee\\" are struggling financially, but find creative ways to amuse themselves. Each girl has her own virtues and flaws, making them quite believable. Their neighbor, Laurie, is a 15yo boy living with his benevolent grandfather and becomes very close friends with the girls. His follies both amuse and annoy the girls.<br />This book is a classic and should be required reading for junior to early high school literature, because it teaches as well as entertains.<br /><br />The story focuses mainly on Jo, the second eldest girl of 15 with a hot temper and a passion for writting.<br /><br />Written over 150 years ago, (I believe), Ms. Alcott is obviously dead-on correct with the details of the time. Having read this book three times, which is something I rarely do, takes you on a journey to a period where children are raised with a strong sense of morals, yet still make the mistakes children will make.<br /><br />This book is followed by the books \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\". Both of which you will want to sink your teeth into if you enjoy \\"Little Women\\". All are free on Kindle. They're perfect stories to curl up with on a snowy day. I believe girls and women will enjoy it more then boys, due to the lack of explosions, super-heros and race cars. (LOL).<br /><br />Having been forced to read the terrible \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and the classic short story \\"The Lottery\\", I wish my school made this a required read as opposed to the aforementioned books. Boys WILL enjoy the antics of Laurence \\"Laurie\\", and though they won't admit it, they too will probably enjoy this book as well. They will definitely enjoy \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" much more. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did and I hope this review helps. Merry Christmas! @LorrieLife.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book. Better than the movie. Can't wait to start the next one.  This book is definitely worth reading.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, but it proved to be an exciting, entertaining, fast paced flick. The glue that holds this movie together, however, is the stellar performance by Guy Pearce. He's always great in any role (too bad he isn't used more often in Hollywood), and his snarky, charismatic character in \\"Lockout\\" is one of his best. Something kind of weird is that he actually looks to be younger and in better shape than he did in \\"Memento\\", and that movie is over ten years old!<br /><br />As previously mentioned, \\"Lockout\\" is entertaining. It got me engaged during the early going, and the pacing is fast and furious, without too much reliance on action. If the movie relies too heavily on anything, it's Pearce's one-liners... yet, somehow, they work. The plot is a bit hokey (though it seemed awfully promising initially), and it defies logic oftentimes (ONE BUTTON is pressed to release EVERY SINGLE convict in the entire prison at once!), but this is not \\"The King's Speech\\"... it's a popcorn action flick with sci-fi elements, and on that level, it's a success.
B00913DPW2|4.0|This app is creepy and very very difficult but very fun. If you like mysteries this is for you. I have been playing for a week and I'm still not done maybe its because I'm only 12 I don't know.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I got this book because I wanted to see how it held up to the TV Series 'Castle.'  I found the mystery good and difficult to guess, and I thoroughly enjoyed the interaction between the characters, just as in the series.  I plan to read more of Richard Castles books and hope to enjoy them just as much as this one.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Actually loved this one better than the first. Great action, and of course all the old fav's playing in it. Will for sure watch again and buy the DVD
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|By far the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. It you like Family Guy or any of Seth McFarlane's other stuff you will probably like this.
B000W93CHC|5.0|A brilliant tome!! You cannot put this book down. A real page turner!! Ken Follett has done it again! I highly recommend this book to anyone!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another John Grisham classic novel.  It is fun and very suspenseful. Love the way Grisham unfolds the story and keeps the reader guessing.
B001PP9ALY|4.0|Extraordinarily violent, tending to gruesomeness... ridiculous and implausible... but fun enough to rate 4 stars. The special effects are very well done, the acting is good, the semi-tongue-in-cheek is fine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen did it again. This book is awesome ,it touched my heart from the first page and I couldn't put the book down. Dean and Skye are perfect.  I don't want to say to much because it will spoil the story for you if you haven't read it yet. But it is a must read!!.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I really enjoy watching this movie. Amazon offered it for a great price, and I was excited to be able to buy it!
0307744434|1.0|I never write reviews for books.  I always take a look at other people's reviews before I read a book and being that this book got an average of 4 stars, I thought it looked good.  This book is so uniteresting and lacks any character development and simply anything that would draw a reader into the novel.  I am so dissapointed in this novel.  I would love to get a better sense of what it was that made people give it such a high rating.  I found it boring and extremely hard to get through.  If you embark, good luck, and hopefully you find something that I did not.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Amazing offer for this DVD. My children really enjoy this movie and I was able to get it for a great deal.
B000H7I6CU|5.0|Not only does it have regular Spanish, it also has the Mexican version Spanish!! Kids will definitely love it and it shipped super fast!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books, and I was so excited to see the movie. It did not disappoint.  I was so glad to be able to get the movie for such a good deal on Amazon
0374214913|5.0|It's difficult to put into words how much pure joy one gets from reading this work. This book is, at the same time, an old-fashioned mystery/detective story, a techno-thriller, historical fiction, an homage to &#34;real&#34; books (i.e., cloth covers, pages you must grasp to turn, special fonts, and tactile appreciation), a testament to friendship, and the value of an old, experienced mentor. Integrating the very old, the old, and the new, both technologically and in human terms, this is the story of the fortuitous relationship of a mysterious old bookstore owner and a curious young clerk, and the unintended consequences of this relationship---namely the quest to solve a 500 year old mystery.<br /><br />This is not great literature. Some have commented that it is not believable. Some have said that its ending is disappointing. People have a right to their opinions. My opinion is that if one seeks pure, interesting, thought-provoking, entertaining reading, this really is the book for you.<br /><br />What's wrong with finishing a book and wishing that there were more, while at the same time feeling a sense of warmth and having a smile on your face?!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|If this tale doesn't make you rejoice, then your soul is broken. The harshest critique I might raise is that some turns of phrase are so out of use that there are moments when it becomes hard to follow. Still, this is an absolute must-read tale of redemption.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was very entertaining and funny. My daughter read it first and recommended it to me. I was leery at first as she & I usually don't like the same kind of books but we both enjoyed this one very much.
B004T4KQJS|1.0|I think the book was well written but I was expecting some ideas that I haven't heard about. Mainly this explains how the<br />Universe could have formed. I was hoping to hear thoughts on what nothing would be like.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love my Kindle and I love my Kindle app with one exception.....I would really, really like to be able to organize my books within the Kindle app on my android tablet and computer/laptop.  I find this very frustrating as I must scroll through ALL of my books (I have quite a few) in order to find a specific one I haven't opened in a while. Other than that, I am quite content.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great<br />1 was great, 2 sucked, 3 brought back my amazement in the creative process.<br />I would highly recommend it.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|Nice story about Amy in Dingle Ireland, and what music she liked. I've watched it many times over! Highly suggest for Amy fans.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This series was not created for the stupid. I appreiate a television show that does not assume I am stupid or inane.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I bought this cd for myself and have since bought  9 more for Christmas gifts. I gave them out early for all to enjoy and everyone loves it. Heck, it's one I could easily listen to after Christmas. Rod Rocks!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The movie was so bad that when froze up so that I could not watch the rest of it; I considered a Christmas blessing!
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE 3D BLU-RAY.<br /><br />I will start this review the way I felt when I first saw it in the movie theater...<br /><br />1. You have to LOVE Cirque Du Soleil. Not just \\"like\\"...you have to love them.<br /><br />2. Don't spend even one second trying to analyse the plot. It's about a young woman who is mesmerized with a young male aerialist and she tries to find him again when they are separated. Everything else are sections of different Las Vegas Cirque shows and even in their entirety don't always make sense. If you try to understand why this is here or that is there, you will run out screaming. Turn off your brain and just let your eyes enjoy all the spectacular.<br /><br />3. It helps a lot to have seen at least a few of these shows in Las Vegas because the movie selects some of the best parts from each.  This will be sort of a video souvenir book for you.<br /><br />4. Did I mention you have to LOVE Cirque du Soleil?<br /><br />The thrilling sequences that the couple encounter individually are from the Las Vegas productions of \\"O,\\" \\"Ka!\\", \\"The Beatles' Love,\\" \\"Mystere,\\" \\"Chris Angel's Believe,\\" \\"Zumanity,\\" and \\"Viva Elvis!\\"...and they come back together for a romantic aerial (updated from \\"Ka!\\").<br /><br />The 3D was spectacular on the movie screen and I have absolutely no qualms about giving it a full 5 of 5 for the 3D Blu-ray.  Scenes from \\"O\\" will have you putting down towels in case of water spilling out of your TV.  There is excellent depth and a few really wonderful popouts.  Colors are glorious!!!<br /><br />I have been to most of these shows in Las Vegas.  While I feel there is never ever any way to capture the experience of seeing them live, especially when performers fly overhead of you, this film does something that seeing it live never could: you will never see the performers this close up, no matter how good a seat you have.  The 3D cameras would occasionally be anywhere from 40 to 80 feet in the air, right there with the performers.<br /><br />Audio is likewise a 5 out of 5.  Great sound all around the room.  (Speaking of music, my favorite Cirque show in Vegas is \\"The Beatles' Love\\" and there are about six scenes from it (with Beatles music in the film, too), including \\"Get Back,\\" \\"Octopus's Garden,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,\\" \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" and the film ends with a group shot of curtain moments for the different show casts set to \\"All You Need Is Love.\\"  \\"Love\\" fans, rejoice!)<br /><br />Extras are really minimal and are located on the 2D Blu-ray disc.  A behind-the-scenes look with James Cameron that is only about 2-3 minutes long.  There is a featurette with star Erica Linz that looks at creating a series of acrobatic moves, and that 10-15 minutes is only minimally interesting.  The remaining extra is an ad for several Vegas Cirque shows.<br /><br />For fans of Cirque du Soleil and 3D, this comes highly recommended.
B00464F19Q|5.0|Beautiful acting, a great story, and more morality them most people find in a church. Not for the faint of heart.
0446572993|1.0|Third party seller again sends me a Book Club or Book of the Month book verses the full publisher copy that I expected.  Threw the book in the recycling bag.  Don't want my money back.  I enjoy reading and look forward to getting the book I ordered.  I only read the publisher versions that are full size, full weight, have the standard font size, and good quality paper. I'm real tired of Amazon supporting companies that are either despicable and greedy, or just don't know what they are doing.  Amazon has shown no interest in fixing this issue, and I've started going to Barnes and Noble for books.I may pay  little more but I'll be assured that I'll receive the book I ordered and not a cheap imitation.  All Amazon has to do is require their 3rd party Seller to list Book CLub or Book of the Month Club books as such in the description of the item on the sale page.  Simple - just do it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so much better then I had expected! I can't wait to read the next one to see what happens next!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The birds and scenery are different from the others.  Makes it like a new game. Fun. I would recommend buying it.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great cover art. The music and lyrics are wonderful and the phrasing is very different from what I am used to. But, very nice for a change. Very comforting in the same vein are Mountain Music can be.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The graphical layout and display is nice but compared to the other weather services we have it seems a bit slower in presenting the forecast.
0670022411|5.0|Had the paper-back, but knew I would wear it out quickly, as I know i will be readin this again time and again. So I was thrilled to be able to obtain this in hardback.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The instructions for how to use this are barely workable. I had some problems figuring it out, but it did seem to work under lighted conditions best.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|What a bargain to enjoy this funny series without commercials .Also bought the 5th season .I rank this series as the finest I have ever viewed and dare I say it's better but not by much than Seinfeld.I just cant understand the writers being able to consistantly keep the quality so high.Now we are in the 6th season ,I feel it's lost it's funniness ,I mean writers cant keep writing great lines forever ,sadly they should just pack it in .They have left us a legacy and I have been watching this series over and over since May and I still laugh although I might have seen each segment 4 or 5 times.Ironically we where in the UK and I saw my first episode by accident while surfing our tv at a B&B we were staying at the Lake District and loved it .<br />Also I see the price has risen ,I Paid about $54 for this.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I found this to be really useful and it seems the graphics are much better than the computer version that I use.
B001AFF25W|5.0|After I read this book, I already have changed! It was very good book indeed. EASY to read!<br />Totally different from the regular books that I tend not to finish after reading a few pages.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Always playing it. I have to stop what I'm doing to check on my village. I JUST LOVE IT TO DEATH
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Every year at Christmas, I pull out this book. This is my very first Kindle copy and I adore it!  The illustrations are absolutely lovely!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was slow to capture my attention, but once it got going I was intriqued.  Unfortunately the ending left me feeling frustrated and unsatisfield.
B001706I5I|5.0|This is a long film, but it keeps me and the kids entertained the whole time. Great music, great humor! Fun for all ages.
B007PFD90G|4.0|I've alwasys been interested in Salman Rushdie's experiences after the Iran fttwa.  He goes into great detail on his experiences, sometims too much, especially when naming international authors/celebraties (probably 2% I recognized.).  Don't know if these names added much to the story.<br /><br />Written in the third person, he he contrasts his experience with security in the UK and other European countries, as well as South American countries with his eperience in the US, which highlighted the advantages we have in this country.  Nowhere but the US did he have any measure of freedom, which speaks well of our country.<br /><br />I'd have rated the book five stars, without the over abundance of names that meant nothing to me.  But it did meet my expectations and I thought it was impressive that he linked his experiences with Ismamic redicals to the 911 attack.<br /><br />Book was writen by an intellectual fot intellectuals.
2070612767|5.0|Aiment ce livre! I haven't read it but it's apparently very good. It's a different dialect of French than they're used to (standard modern French) but that gives me an opportunity I teach them vocabulary :) The parents of the kids love that I improve their kids' language skills while I watch them haha I bought it used and it looked new- dont be afraid to buy used!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Eye opener for me, although I am not surprised by what I learned, having worked on a wheat research farm as a teenager.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book, in fact all books by Tim, are incredibly inspiring, informative, and practical. Most people with this kind of knowledge keep it to themselves. It's always refreshing to see people that sincerely want to inspire and build others up to become more capable, intelligent, and grounded in action instead of theory alone. I'll buy anything this guy puts out and I hope you see the value in this too!
B00881PPTO|3.0|When I used Kayak, I wasn't bothered by ads. I simply picked this up because it was free at the time.<br />We don't use it much at the moment, but we will be traveling a bit more next year and it will be nice to have it available then.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|SUITS IS OUTSTANDING!!!!!PLEASE CONTINUE TO RUN THIS SERIES. EXCELLENT CAST AND WRITING! PHOTOGRAPHY  ON NYC IS TRULY BEAUTIFULLY DONE. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|This felt like Twilight to me. When I saw the Twilight movie, it was okay, but it made me want to read the book.<br />Hunger games was about the same. Well done, but lacking the depth that a book might deliver.<br /><br />It may just be me, but it felt like the camera was bouncy. At the beginning of the movie the way everything moved felt fast and unnatural and made me a little dizzy. I tried adjusting settings on my tv, but I didn't notice a difference and I eventually adjusted to it.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Hubby loves the movie and I really like watching it with him. Plus it got here super fast. Blu ray rocks!
B005LAII08|4.0|I started watching this in 3D, but it turned out the disc was messed up and I had to send it back to be replaced.<br />No problems with Amazon. They replaced it very quickly.<br />I finished watching the movie on just regular Blu-ray with no issues, and it was great.<br />I don't think it was Pixar's greatest story, but still a beautiful movie.<br />I'm torn between four and five stars. I go with 4 because, although I love Pixar and Disney, and the story had a great message and was beautifully delivered as usual; an overall look at the story left me thinking it could have been a little better.
044656740X|3.0|This book is reasonably good, but the whole thing is available as an audio book on youtube. Also, after listening to it, I found out that Kiyosaki completely made up the whole &#34;Rich Dad&#34; story, and has made the great bulk of his money from selling these books on making money. He's kind of a phony.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|It was a fun movie to begin with.<br />Now on blu-ray it looks better than ever. I'm not a professional, and some people get nit-picky about their HD.<br />To me it looked good, and not like they simply burned the VHS to Blu-ray.
B00005JPFH|5.0|This is one of the top movies in my list. I loved all 3 and am happy to have this to complete my collection.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved the movie.<br />Put together very well. Sure, there hare errors here and there, but Joss Whedon did an excellent job balancing all the characters. I enjoyed Captain America much more here than in his own movie.<br /><br />Looks great on Blu-ray, looks great in 3D.<br />Overall I thoroughly enjoyed The Avengers.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|We live in a new era...most of our stress comes from &#34;taming excess&#34;.<br />I just read &#34;Radical&#34;...taking a biblical look at the same issue...so in the spirit of the book, I will read it on my Kindle and keep it from cluttering my bookshelf!
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I wasn't sold at first, but after watching it again, I will give it the thumbs up.<br /><br />The characters seemed a little hard to connect with, and it felt a little scripted; didn't flow as well as the great movies do.<br />It took the second watch through to appreciate it more.<br /><br />I haven't tried out the 3D yet, but I expect good things.
0920668364|5.0|A friend of mine read this to a support group for young mothers several years back. She passed away this summer and no my children have children of their own. I plan to share this book with my grandchildren at our annual birthday party for Jesus. A very precious rendition of the cycles of parenting.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Some people say it's ET for the next generation.<br />I thought it was enjoyable, but doesn't quite stand up to ET.<br /><br />The indie Zombie film was the best part!!
B009K916ZK|4.0|Okay, it's not magic, but this does what it says it does. And it's nice and sturdy, unlike the cheaper knock-offs.
B006H5120E|5.0|Everyone knows the movie was great.<br />Now we can say that they returned to it and did an excellent job bringing it to life again in 3D.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|This was kind of like an episode of the X-Files where all week the teasers said this week's episode will answer many questions, only to find after the episode that you understand what's happening even less. So these super aliens started all life across the galaxy? Or they're out to destory it? And the traditional alien creature we know from the other films is born at the end because why? And we all have the same DNA? Sigh.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Good app for purchasing music on the go and accessing my music on Amazon Cloud.<br />The big disappointment for me is that I can't purchase albums with digital booklets.<br />I don't know why digital music doesn't all include the booklets anyway, but that's an industry thing, I guess.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This sucks you in.  Even though some of the games are kind of lame you will want to play them to see what is coming next.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|A great film; to be sure. I still feel it went too quickly.<br />Too powerful a villain to be killed off in one movie.<br />The story line seemed to jump from challenge to challenge, without any true development, and then you're at the final showdown when it feels like you're just getting started.<br /><br />I did not get into the special features yet, so they aren't included in this rating.
B00846TTDG|5.0|An action film lover's dream.  Don't know if this was close to the real thing or not, but who cares!?!  Highly predictable, but still a great escape for two hours.
B00198X0VS|5.0|It was a fun movie to begin with.<br />Now on blu-ray it looks better than ever. I'm not a professional, and some people get nit-picky about their HD.<br />To me it looked good, and not like they simply burned the VHS to Blu-ray.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|Es un entretenimiento muy divertido para los niños y mayores. Sus gráficos son muy alegres y con mucho colorido. Lo recomiendo para disfrutar con toda la familia, especialmente para jugar con niños pequeños. lo recomiendo.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|The movie was a great product to rent.  The actual movie had an okay story line.  Still disappointed in the amount of love story and lack of vampire fighting.
076115728X|5.0|This book I bought before and LOVED the message and the art within it.  We lost the book during a move across country so I reordered on amazon.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A well written and amazing story. I could visualize the story as I read the words. Although it nearly brought me to tears, I couldn't stop reading.
B005SZAEYO|1.0|The scariest thing about this episode was/were the numerous shots of Dylan McDermott's ass. Other than that, I think this will appeal to the younger (most likely female) audience.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Smart dude. A clairvoyant individual indeed. Someone real yet untouchable. Beautiful yet reflective of the disgusting entity we call humanity.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First, this is my first Colleen Hoover book. I have not read Slammed/Point of No Return. I can promise you, that is about to change.<br /><br />Hopeless is one of the most amazing books I have read in 2012. It has firmly planted itself second behind The Sea of Tranquility, which unfortunately a lot of people have compared it to.  Yes, there are similarities. But I can find similarities with it and other books as well. It is absolutely silly to spout plagiarism or other nonsense. These authors word tirelessly over these stories and they deserve to be appreciated. Okay, with that said, let me tell you why this book is a beyond 5 star read.<br /><br />Funny! &#34;Breckin shrugs. “I’m new here. And if you haven’t deducted from my impeccable fashion sense, I think it’s safe to say that I’m…” he leans forward and cups his hand to his mouth in secrecy. “Mormon,” he whispers.&#34;<br /><br />Sexy! &#34;“Let me inform you of something,” he says in a low voice. “The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you’ve never felt anything when someone’s kissed you, then no one’s ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.”<br /><br />References my favorite book! &#34;I’m not a sucker for happily ever afters, but if these two characters don’t get theirs I might climb inside this e-reader and lock them both inside that damn garage forever!&#34;<br /><br />The story of Sky and Holder is one that we will all remember and all think about months after reading. The twists and turns this young couple experience, are like none you could ever imagine. The game of &#34;firsts&#34; was amazing, beautiful and even partly frustrating The storyline takes your breath away and at times makes you want to scream. The additional characters added even more. They didn't feel wasteful or unimportant but rather built on what can only be described as a love story for all ages.<br /><br />I agree with many reviews when they say block out a time to read this. DON'T PUT IT DOWN! I promise you won't regret it! Experiencing my &#34;first&#34; Colleen Hoover book is one first I will always remember.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game and the regular Quell.  Played them both on my Kindle fire,  then re installed months later. My go to game for relaxing...but I must get it perfectly!
1611133408|5.0|there is nothing better than travelling back to your childhood and the audio book just makes it better! chris' voice is very versitile and so angelic its perfect to listen to
B008NB0SQO|4.0|This is a wonderful movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is very disappointing that they decided to remove at least one of the songs from the original version.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love the movie, so I also love the book, although the movie is better than the book. I didn't like the book, also, because it is different from the movie.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Awesome seller very fast shipping perfect seeing I'm a last minute shopper.  great show great acting always exciting always something new to get your heart racing most defiantly a seat clenching series!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Ted was a pretty enjoyable ride. It starred Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, with Seth MacFarlane using his familiar [[ASIN:B000083C6V Family Guy]] voice to give life to Ted.  Perhaps over the top at times (but that's what the movie is going for), Ted kept me entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />The humor is often rude & crude, but expectations should be set for that knowing that Family Guy creator MacFarlane directed, produced and wrote the movie. There is silliness, ridiculousness and corny 'o plenty, along with a well put together story that had me mostly smiling or laughing for over 90 minutes. Keep in mind that prior to the DVD release this was an R rated movie, so don't make the mistake of thinking that this is some cute for the kids teddy bear comes to life movie. The R rated version earned its R, and the unrated version will delight fans of...well...unrated stuff.<br /><br />If you're looking for laughs you'll certainly find some in Ted. If you're not a fan of Family Guy humor, then move to the next movie in your queue.<br /><br />3 ½ stars.

B00555X8OA|5.0|This is one of those rare works in psychology that can occur only when an author of powerful vision appears (maybe once per generation) who can see an organizing principle whose simplicity (few \\"working parts\\" with great combinatorial capability)makes possible limitless diversity). Thinking Fast and Slow is a remarkably clear view of how a human brain perceives and interprets the medium in which it has evolved(all the more convincing for \\"blind spots\\"--really what the book is about--which are vestiges of in situ evolution).  This is the only review of scientific work I know of that posits what is stranger than we can imagine without violating its premise.<br /><br />Jack E.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|this is a beast when it comes to cooling your cpu .... silent and when the second optional fan ... damn!!! its a force to reckon with. Cooler master always the pros when coming to keeping you system kool under pressure.<br /><br />Cons: To mount it was abit tricky as you to have to mount a new backplate, and flip the mobo couple times to ensure that the screws all go in neatly and securely.<br /><br />All in all, great construction .... great airflow and great cooling. Thankx coolermaster
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Got this for my nephew's Christmas present. This is his favorite movie! Constantly, wanted to take my mom's, but being her favortive movie she wouldn't let him. Looked everywhere could not find it. Till, I looked on amazon!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I am currently reading it now and am enjoying it so much ...saw the movie...the book is so much better.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Daughter loves it. Really Fun!!Its a game she's been wanting for a while now. Keeps her busy for hours on end.
0689815816|5.0|We love the book as well as the acted-out activity that goes along with an audio book version-it's a great extended-activity, anytime!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|keep it everywhere. client phone lists and recipes. I have it on my phone computers and kindle fire. I access it at the grocery and client sites.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I chose this game because friends were playing it.  I found that it is very addicting!<br />Some of the levels are really challenging, so it keeps your brain going.<br />I love it!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|This cable is simply a needed accessory, however, I suggest keeping an eye on it to be sure it won't suddenly disintegrate like my last one did.  How can someone rate a cable five stars. Why, because it works?  That's what it's paid to do.  Now, if it automatically plugged itself into my Kindle when it &#34;knew&#34; it needed to be refreshed, well, that would be a five star rating.  Otherwise, it's okay, it works.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Nope, no Data here. Not at all. Those 50-odd reviews and hundreds of spoilers online totally are lying about Commander Data being resurrected in this book.<br /><br />...yeah, this is probably the worst-kept secret since Spock's death in Star Trek II. But honestly, it's done really well. David Mack brings together just about every single loophole from the TV series, movies and even other novels to bring back everyone's favorite Android in some fashion. And the most incredible thing is that it really flows quite well.<br />I'll admit to being skeptical when a major plot-twist was thrown my way, but the switch from a third person narrative to more of a first-person journal-esque format to explain where this plot twist came from really worked incredibly well. Rather than going \\"yeah, right,\\" I wound up actually more invested in the story than before. I can see where others will probably blow it off, though, and be completely disinterested for the massive 3/4ths of the book that segment takes. It's a risk, but it paid off spectacularly in my opinion.<br /><br />While nowhere quite as engrossing or shocking as Mack's previous trilogy, Star Trek: Destiny, the first book of this new trilogy seems to be setting up a really interesting story with quite a few 'hidden secrets' that will come to light. And espionage, too, which is always a plus.<br /><br />If you're a Data fan, you really should check this out. And if you're just a regular 'Trek fan, then you should still read it too.
B0064W652A|5.0|Amazing story, can't recommend this one enough.  It's been awhile since I read a Batman story that I've enjoyed this much
0375842209|1.0|I had really high hopes for this book but it did not come close to delivering them.  Boring, slow, extremely weak plot.  The multiple stories of Liesels life were very disjointed and did very little to push the story to its ending, which after reading I still don't know what it is.  And the foreshadowing ensured that there was not a single surprise to be had.  Waste of time!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A fairly well-written book about a fascinating dream that this man had while in a coma. Unfortunately not entirely believable.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|In general I loved it and am waiting on tenterhooks for the next book, but I have some serious dislikes as well. My main criticism, not just with this book but the entire Heroes of Olympus series, is that it doesn't have that same slick, well put-together feeling of the original series. It almost feels like fan-fiction in comparison: the multi-character narration feels very disjointed, and in this book in particular I didn't get any sense of personality from half the cast even when other characters are getting fleshed out more. I know that it is very hard to handle eight main characters, plus countless secondary characters, but a better jo could have been done.<br /><br />Again, over-all I loved the story, I think I've just gotten spoiled by the quality of the original series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun and entertaining!!! good game for kids and adults. this game will keep you preoccupied for hours.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Beautifully done complete with illustrations. Love the assortment of Kindle books available.<br />At your fingertips any time you need! Wonderful!
B00802EYDO|4.0|This disc sounds pleasing enough, but compared to other sources out there (vinyl, CD, SACD, DVD-A, high-resolution downloads) this disc sounds more \\"pretty\\" than it does musical. I thought the same thing of the 2L sampler, which came with a much better sounding SACD of the same material (as on the 2L Blu-ray disc).
1451627297|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book. Stephen King rarely disappoints and this novel is no exception. It kept me up past my bedtime many nights.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|First of all, I can not get any weather on it. It comes up with the default for Los Angeles weather, but I can't even get that. Second of all, it does not allow me to add/enter my city for weather. I can't believe how crappy this app is.
141659521X|5.0|This was a gift to my husband - he said it was great to see Mitch Rapp back in present day.  Vince Flynn keeps getting better and better!  He is great at predicting the geo-political dynamics and writing a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat to the very end!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Nice little training tool. Good for the novice and the well trained, and a whole lot of fun to play!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game everyday and love it! Very addicting game. So happy I started playing it. LOVE IT LOTS!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I wish I didn'[t have to pay for this first of all, second of all, it faces the person taking the picture, so hard to take pictures (other than of yourself)...sometimes pictures come out kind of fuzzy too...definitely needs work. Easy access to your pictures and videos though, so plus for that.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I absolutely love it!! All MJ fans will love this. includes unreleased songs!! One of the best box sets ever!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|this book was my first kindle buy! such a great tear jerker and awesome story.very well told by the perspective of a dog.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|No plot summaries here, just a review of this great movie's transfer from SD to the current Blu Ray version.  Included here is a DVD digital copy and the Blu Ray Disc.  I already have the Standard Def version on a previously purchased DVD and have not looked at the SD digital copy, so this review covers only the Blu Ray copy.<br /><br />The video transfer is the star of this film as Universal really seems to have put some real effort into bringing out the best possible imaging onto this blu ray disc.  The colors just pop all over the place with no artificiality at all.  In the beginning of the film there is a lot of red on the carpets and elsewhere.  Any one who knows about filming and editing and such knows that the color red is very difficult to reproduce due to color bleeding and artifacting.  This is one reason why you rarely see red used in credits.  However, the reproduction on Casino is gorgeous.  There is no grain that you will notice nor stair-stepping of any kind which you might have seen in previous versions especially when the strip in Las Vegas is shown with all the different lights down the street.  No aliasing or artifacts anywhere.  A great transfer to Blu Ray.  5 stars.<br /><br />The audio is lossless DTS HD MA and sounds like it.  The audio score envelopes you in so many places.  While this film is mainly dialogue via narration, most will be coming from your center speaker and there is little for the LFE sub channel to work with, however, the surrounds are subtly used for ambience as well as the score.  There is very little use made of your discreet channels and hardly any directional foley fx which is a shame as in the casino you would think there would be plenty.  While following the film, you forget about this, still more discreet directionality from the surrounds might have be included.  Never the less, the audio levels are perfect so set it the way you want and kick back.  The audio, I would give 3.5-4 stars.  The movie as a whole, including the transfer to Blu Ray stays at 5 stars for me.<br /><br />The extras include a few outtakes which they say are deleted scenes, a 15 minute documentary on the real gangsters and start of Las Vegas and a nice 45 minute reprint of a History channel documentary about the truth of the story and characters portrayed in Casino.  I had no idea this movie had really happened in real life.<br /><br />All I can say is that the video transfer to blu ray is DEMO worthy and the upgrade from Standard Def to Blu Ray is well worth it.  I just need to know what to do with my mint condition Standard Def disc.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksthe transfer to Blu Ray stays at 5 stars for me.<br /><br />The extras include a few outtakes which they say are deleted scenes, a 15 minute documentary on the real gangsters and start of Las Vegas and a nice 45 minute reprint of a History channel documentary about the truth of the story and characters portrayed in Casino.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I could not put this one down it just pulls you in as any great story should. The characters were well thought out as was the plot. I love that Pendergrast and Procter were bested by Alban it just gives their character more depth. I love the Nazis in the story with their base in the jungle residing in a volcano. Simply put this was a book well worth waiting for.

1442362901|5.0|There are more details in this audiobook than I can even describe.  It is an inside look at what goes on behind the scense of the highest job in the land.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I should have read a couple reviews or at least a synposis before I bought this.  I'm bored with the supernatural crap.  And I can't say much for the writing either.  A stilted psuedo formalistic style that did nothing to move the prose along.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|I cant wait until the next season.  Even with the new actor it is a great series and excellent to watch.
1419705849|5.0|This is the only book series I can get my eleven-year-old to read and enjoy. I don't know how Jeff Kinney did it, but I'm glad he did. I also enjoy reading these with my son.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Love every single track. This movie was awesome, fun, and a wonderful surprise. Listening to the soundtrack always brings a smile to my face and I can't help but sing-along most of the time. It would have been an even fantastic soundtrack if they had included the Titanium duet between Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow. Also, those mash-ups that Beca compiled in the movie.

6305428042|5.0|I bought this movie from Wal-Mart yesterday, to begin with.<br />I'd seen the movie on TV before, and whenever I seen it, it was just average. It wasn't an above-the-top Halloween movie. What I didn't know was that what I was actually watching on the TV was a watery version of the movie. It was run through a supreme filter. I like to use the image of making coffee. The movie is the coffee grinds in the coffee pot that the water comes through. They sit there and the water goes through, but all that comes out is the FLAVOUR of the grinds without the grinds themselves. That perfectly paints the picture in this case, actually. They filtered it so you could get the TASTE of the movie, but you wouldn't get the real bulk of the movie.<br />I realize now, being the owner of the DVD, that I horribly underrated this film. I didn't really know that the movie was what it was because of those superfilters for the movie.<br />Basically, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you're hating on the movie because you saw it on TV, get the DVD because it is a lot better when you see the movie unedited, as it was intended to be seen.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My daughter immediately loved this sweet little doll, her new favorite! A pretty little doll that my 2 yr ld just adores
B004V9MU86|5.0|Best thing I have read all year. It stands out from the rest with an unexpected style of delivery and plot.
B0096CDG0O|2.0|There is no point to this game because all your doing is rolling the dice to make a match of the dice.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 3 has been nothing short of amazing.  The shock and awe moments of this season make true fans fall even harder for the show.  No character is safe from the looming death or after death effects and it makes watching this season truly filled with great anxiety wondering what will happen next.  The characters are beautifully developed and the growth of the key players stand out as well.  This has been the best season yet.  And watching on my kindle en route from my military installation to home made the trip that much better.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|This game is not fun because theirs really nothing to do or play. It's plain and I would not recommend it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Loved the book. Good honest book. Not very well written but a great read because it is a real story of real events.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best minecraft ever I recommend this app and thanks mojang for the minecraft and make a update for creepers and other things
B00006AG5N|5.0|I bought this CD to brush up on my Elvis music prior to taking my Mom on a trip to Graceland in Memphis. I didn't consider myself to be an Elvis fan but when you listen to so many compelling tracks all crammed together on a single album, there really is no denying the genius that was Elvis.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very in depth of Dr. Alexander experience.  I am interested in how the human body functions and he gives a very good physiology of how the brain works.<br />Here we have a man who just went through the motions of his Christianity, was a scientist and and just didn't buy all of the stories of Heaven, thought there was a valid physiological explanation for people who claimed they had near death experiences....until he had his catastrophic medical event, where he found out that God does truly exist, as well as Heaven.<br />The book is very well written, and understandable even for those who claim no knowledge of anatomy and physiology, he explains it all.He brings his beautiful experience, to light, of finding Heaven to people who claim there is no God and no Heaven I fully enjoyed this book in all respects..
B009ZE27US|1.0|just a waist of your time don't get it. totally not worth it now I am just trying to get the 20word minimum thing so yeah I am done.
B005A1ER0I|4.0|I would recommend this album. Its solid in my humble opinion. Of course there are a few songs that I may not like but overall it is well put together.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|BIggest issue with this presentation?  Visual's are good, not great.  But big turn off is the constant selling of the global warming issue.  Keep the politics out of a potentially good video!
B009XY97VC|4.0|This is definitely different from any other albums produced. Overall, its a good album. There are one or two songs that I don't like but its a solid album.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|If you want a really good read in terms of styling and plot then this is a timeless masterpiece of a thriller.
0547995660|2.0|this book has a great story line, but a terrible ending. I really wish the auther would hve either taken off the last paragraph or so, or added a few more chapters. also i found that the way that people were released was a bit disturbing, but the way that jonas's dad releasesd the newborn child was the most disturbing of all, especially how he lied about it. Good book, just skip the ending.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I did give this book one star, only because I found one or two pearls of wisdom!  Other than that it was a waste of time and money. I should have followed my instints early on and stop reading it about 40 pages in or sooner, but I almost always finish all books I start-just a habit that I may need to break after this waste of time!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Too much medical lingo, not enough simple, what to eat and what not to eat. It has all the info, but too much digging is needed
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good way to pass the time. Some are tough enough to keep you busy for quite a while. Not a bad app.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is a must read for anyone who loves American history. It uniquely captures the wit and skill of Lincoln.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This was pretty long but it didn't feel like it.  I could have watched another 3 hours of it.  I bet the book wasn't better.  Great action and story.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Had been looking  for a caffeine eye treatment---finally found it. After just a few days I can see & feel the difference. I will keep using it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book is all about character details. You will know every tiny detail of what each character thinks and feels. I enjoyed it for sure but I didn't love it and race home to read another chapter after work. At times I wondered if anyone in this town could be happy for five minutes and a little variety with all the nasty character traits would have been a nice mix to throw in. Overall, I would definitely recommend it.
0307454568|3.0|After reading the first two books in this trilogy I decided to complete the set. This book is very long and convoluted with countless people who have interminably long backstories. The beginning drew me in, but after about a hundred pages it just took too long to get where it was going...and the journey was painfully slow. It almost doesn't pay to review this book because the author unfortunately died. Hornet's Nest doesn't even seem totally like Mr. Larsson's style as others have pointed out. Read it if you must complete the trilogy, but don't have high expectations.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|if you build out of que it wont let you gain reward for the build. unfair really. not all of us play with the same methodology. you have to destroy buildings and then waste money to rebuild to get the rewards. wth
B0084U0IEG|3.0|The book was a very slow read for me...in fact I haven't finished it yet because I'm just not interested in the ending. I expected much more action or suspense in the novel since it is based on a female in the spy business but there isn't.
B005KIR3PC|4.0|My grandsons  have never been disappointed  with any Lego products. I was told by one that this one is cool because you have choices to make 3 types of vehicles
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Grisham and this book did not disappoint! Hard to put down!  You won't be disappointed!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I love Family Guy.  I think the one liners are funny and efficient.  But over an hour of them with a cgi bear is too much.  Save your money and catch this one on cable.  All the cameos are only to do Marky Mark a favor here and none of it is funny.  I think Mila Kunis knew it was a stinker when she read it but Marky Mark made her some monetary promise.  This one plain stinks.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Plot was a bit thin, but well acted and directed. Music was spot on. Always a pleasure to watch Jessica Chastain and Tom Hardy.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry goes back to an old case that has been bothering him for over 20+ years.  He needs to contend with a superior who is looking to dump him.  Keeps you thinking and has some twist and turns.  I recommend this for any mystery fan.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Without giving away the plot, wait, sorry there wasn't much of a plot.  What little there was took a lot of time to develop and left you flat at the end.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a must read. It will have you smiling from beginning to end. The author did a wonderful job making you feel like u are apart of the story. Great characters and I loved how they were developed. I finished this book in 4 hours
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn did another good job putting this story together.  It is a little different, which is a good thing.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|I'VE REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING ALL SECTIONS! NOT TOO HARD BUT FUN! ENJOYED THE VARIETY OF PUZZLES AND ADVENTURES TO FOLLOW.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Couldn't wait to get this movie because I didn't get to see it in the theater.  I was a little disappointed, not with the acting, but with the story and special effects.  It just didn't measure up to the first three Bourne movies.
B004R0YHI0|4.0|I really enjoy movies based on true stories.  Even though movies embellish the plot to an almost unrecognizable story, still, I find them interesting.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This was a good series, but I dont understand the crazy following it received. Well written with unexpected twists and turn. Definitely a read versus a watch. The movie ruined many wonderful things that were in the books.
B0027WNRJ0|5.0|The music will go on forever. I am glad to finally see it digitalized for the modern group of us listening
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is beyond worth it. I have re-read the series 3 times already. It took awhile for me to get into the first book- definitely pushed the boundaries of my comfort zone.
B009B0L324|5.0|Great music from a great band. I was thrilled to see that they are still playing and putting out good music. Rock on!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is beyond worth it. I have re-read the series 3 times already. Well written and keeps you guessing!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|i payed amazon to stream it and i couldnt stream it to my laptop.  then when i contacted customer service about it they said that they were not allowed to process refunds for streaming videos.  awesome.  but they did eventually give me my money back but only after slapping me in the face with that comment.

Darn it all.!<br />I think the attempt was wonderful but the outcome just not that moving...  Samantha Barks is the best of the entire ensemble.  I sincerely am trying to love this recording as much as I love every other album recorded in the name of Les Miserables.... THE GREATEST BOOK TO MUSICAL EVER!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is beyond worth it. I have re-read the series 3 times already. Well written and keeps you guessing! Unexpected ending that keeps you guessing until the very end.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I don't see how the movie could be better. It was a thrilling story, and I could not put it down 'til it was finished.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was a good series, but I dont understand the crazy following it received. Well written with unexpected twists and turn. Definitely a read versus a watch. The movie ruined many wonderful things that were in the books.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I struggled through some parts of the book, many in fact, that were a lot of words that I thought added very little if anything to the lengthy story line. When I got my kindle I promised myself I would read the classics and I have read a lot of them and found most of them to be very wordy and this tome is no exception. When I heard the movie was coming out I wanted to read the book first and I'm gald I did. Now, when I see the movie I will be able to follow the story line better I'm sure.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I did nôt think it was as good as most of his books.  I believe it was a mediocre effort by Connelly.
B003CIG7AO|5.0|This is one of the best albums I own! All of the songs on the album are amazing and really speak to me. The voices blend amazingly well and the lyrics are beautiful!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I have been playing the free version for a while and decided to get this 'HD' version. My hope was that it would migrate my progress from the free version. No such luck there. Then I thought at least the better graphics would be worth replaying the levels. What a joke! I opened both versions and switched back and forth and never noticed any better quality. It is the exact same game. Don't waste your money.
B000E6GCJS|5.0|I really like Band of Horses and their first album is amazing. From The First Song to the last song, the album really speaks to me.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|My son likes the game so far. seems to work fine, without any problems yet...good kids game and fun for adults to join in
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Christmas season must see! Grew up watching this as a family tradition every Christmas eve and/or Christmas day and will continue the tradition! Laugh out loud no matter how many times I have seen it, and if you havent seen it yet-buy because you will want to own it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this clock, I rely on it every morning to get me up for work and it has never let me down.
1451695195|5.0|I found Dr. Alexander, in this book, to be sincere, his credentials impeccable and his argument--that his brain's cortex was just about dead, yet he was conscious--persuasive.<br /><br />A number of people have dismissed Dr. Alexander's account as wishful thinking, a delusion, a hoax he's using to make money.  They seem determined to shoot down anything that doesn't fit their own set-in-stone convictions about the nature of Life.<br /><br />But one thing I've found helpful when asking myself, \\"Could they be right?  Am I only 'wishing and hoping' that what Dr. Alexander and other have written is true?\\"<br /><br />That thing is to distinguish between resonance and fear-assuagement.  That is, am I filled with fear about the afterlife (the \\"unknown\\") and my believing accounts like this makes my fears diminish--at least for a while?<br /><br />Or, as I read, do I feel my whole spirit opening up in warmth and love to the experience, and saying, \\"This *feels* true\\"--with no fears involved.<br /><br />That's resonance.<br /><br />Even though Dr. Alexander's title is misleading--he can't factually provide \\"proof\\" of heaven (no one on earth can, nor were we meant to)--if my spirit expands with every word I read, then I have my proof.<br /><br />We live in a world in which fear motivates us more than love.  I believe that's one of the lessons we're here to learn: how to be motivated by love rather than fear.  (That, I believe, is the reason why so many fearful things exist here: to give us lots of \\"practice\\" in learning this lesson.)<br /><br />Our organized religions use fear to \\"bring us to God.\\"  Yet, in all the centuries we've had these religions, we seem as far away from the God of Love as ever.<br /><br />Interestingly, though Dr. Alexander says he's a Christian, he doesn't, as I recall, mention meeting Jesus in his NDE, nor any element of traditional Christian theology.  Most importantly he emphasizes that there's no hell.<br /><br />Could it be that he didn't meet \\"Jesus\\" in his NDE, not because Jesus doesn't exist, but because we've been taught to think of Jesus as the one who saves us from a wrathful God and eternal torture?  And you wouldn't meet *that* Jesus in the place Dr. Alexander describe.<br /><br />I think humanity's finally learning--through NDE testimonies like Dr. Alexander's--that fear and God are at opposite poles.  Far from considering \\"God-fearing\\" a virtue, we're learning to see it now as a contradiction: where there's fear, there can't be God.  Where there's God, there can't be fear.<br /><br />So I recommend that when you read accounts like these--and in everything, really--be conscious of whether an experience is allaying your fears, or opening your spirit.  If the former, question the experience.  If the latter--embrace it.  It's bringing you home.<br /><br />One final word about hell: when you listen to people preaching it, notice the energy they're giving off.  I've invariably found it to be angry, bombastic, gloomy, dour, melancholy.  Does that feel like God energy?<br /><br />Now check out Dr. Alexander on a video clip (just google for them), and notice the energy he gives out: soft, gentle, kindly, never raising his voice.<br /><br />Let your own spirit (minus every fear) tell you which energy feels most like God.
B001UE276A|5.0|This box set is a must for the die hard DM fan!!!! I've been a DM fan since the early 80's and still amazed that they and a few other 80's bands are putting out quality material to this day. In addition to the 3 CDs, the DVD and the 2 books were like bonus items!!! There's even 5 postcards included which have great art work on them. I can't wait for DM to come out with their new CD and the tour following in 2013!!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I've been (and still am) a Zep fan from their very beginning, bought their first album when it was released in 1969. Every album and even some bootlegs I could get my hands on. Some bootlegs were much better than their 'The Song Remains The Same', of which I always found it's just an 'okay' album.<br /><br />Now, Celebration Day, wow, listen to it, watch the DVD and every day is a celebration day. The video editing could have been a  lot better, but the concert itself is unbelievable. Dim the lights, lite some candles, even some incense for that real 70's feel, put that DVD on surround sound, crank up the volume and you'll feel like you are there. Me and my friend were bouncing up and down the couch and we caught ourselves cheering, clapping and going crazy like the public did. Two hours of total bliss.<br />CD in the player in the car makes driving through whatever traffic a breeze, you might even wanna look for a traffic jam :)<br />I've seen these guys live in '73, heard many live albums, nothing like this one. It is a HAVE TO have or you are not a true Zep fan. Don't miss out on this one
B009MO57H6|2.0|I’m a fan of the Resident Evil movies and especially Milla Jovovich. But Resident Evil Retribution is a flop on many levels, or all levels. The movie had the obligatory scene with Milla half-naked, and Zombies coming out of nowhere in particular. The plot, if there was one, was predictable. Milla showed her age in close-ups. The graphics were same-o, same-o. The story appeared to be written by a fifth grader, just in time for Christmas sales. This is the last movie with Milla I will buy. I’m glad I still have movies to enjoy staring Kate Beckinsale or Kristen Stewart. If you want to complete your collection of Resident Evil, then make this your last R.E. buy.
B00A135YUW|4.0|Lana stays true to the style of her first album, mellow vintage sound. The only difference is this album is explicit, which I don't<br />mind at all; but others might. Regardless, I enjoy this album for the drive home from work.
B00913DPW2|3.0|I'm a fan of Mist (1,2,3, and 5), Loom, Journeyman Project 3, and several of the Monkey Island games.  Overall I found this game fun, but it had some major problems:<br />1) A lot of the puzzles involve finding some very small object, hidden in a complicated scene.<br />For example, the flashlight...  The flashlight is important, and very hard to see in the scene where it's hidden.  Worse, you don't know you're looking for it, and you don't know where, making it easier to miss.<br /><br />2) A lot of the \\"mini games\\" don't have any feedback or instructions.<br />The \\"rotate the wire\\" puzzle comes to mind.  You have to rotate the wires to bring \\"power\\" from the supply to one of the end lights.  Simple enough and easy to guess EXCEPT that's not the actual puzzle.  Actually, you have to bring power from the beginning to the end without any open ends.  The problem is, there is no feedback until you solve the entire puzzle, so you either guess the rules right, or you get stuck.  Not a good design.  If this were something like Myst, you'd be able to see graphical feedback showing the leak, and the end not having enough \\"pressure\\" or similar.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|funny movie - great to forget yourself for a few hours.  Love the fight scene, hard to believe he filmed it acting against a standard stuffed teddy bear and nothing else
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This book is in the same world as Elantris, but can be read independently.  There's two major &#34;call outs&#34; but those were really only put in as &#34;Easter eggs&#34; for loyal fans, and you don't need to have read either to fully enjoy the other.<br /><br />This story is slow, very thoughtful, and has a fun twist at the end.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|This movie is great for anyone who is considering dating and/or a relationship, is dating or in a relationship, or is wondering if they have a good relationship or should they get out of it.  The movie demonstrates (very well) many different types of relationships, both good and bad, and gives us some insight into what we might be doing wrong, or where we need to draw boundaries.  Also, pay attention to the in between scenes in the movie, where they cut away to people who are not in the movie -- those scenes are hilarious, but oh so true!  I suggest following up with the book.  It has a lot of little quips in it that really open your eyes to what's really going on.  Save yourself the heartbreak and/or embarassment, and move on until you find the one who treats you well!  In the meantime, keep both feet on the ground, and remember that you do matter and your feelings matter!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I liked the book but had some reservations. There too many wise cracks which often impede the flow of the thought. I really enjoyed the history and geography of Yemen and the descriptions of it's politics.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG! She's done it again. I never write reviews, but this isn't really a review. This is more of a gushing outpour of my love for Colleen's books. The emotion that she invokes in me as I read her books is so profound that I am in tears every time, desperately wondering where this amount of emotion comes from.....truly. I have read more breakout novels of the year than I can even remember and none of them hold a candle to Colleen's books.....period. With that being said, I would really love to see some 'grownup' books in her future, displaying the depth of passion she has put forth in her previous novels. Thank you, Colleen, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing your gift with the world. :-)
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is one of the best Christmas movies ever. It arrived ahead of schedule there for we were able to enjoy it over the holiday. Great price for a blu-ray!!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|All the movies in this series are so sweet!  I can't wait to give it to my daughter on xmas day :)
B000YHG72E|5.0|This by far is one of my favorite Christmas movies ever. You can't help but laugh and the whole family loves it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Temple run is about 2% better than this. it is also very exciting with all the missiles that you get shot by! My friend Alexa. thinks that&quot; ITS VERY COOL. I HATE TEMPLE RUN&quot;  My other friend Evan said that &quot; I ENJOY THE JETPACK IN THE FACTORY,BUT I HATE TEMPLE RUN. ITS BORING!!!!!!!&quot;
B0053O89WY|5.0|You can't go wrong with the Big Bang Theory. The item was delivered quickly and at a great price. Didn't even get a chance to watch it before friends were asking to borrow it.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Works so seamlessly with Google you swear it's a Google app.  Best system for reading and organizing RSS sources on a mobile device.  Happy that there is wide spectrum of platforms.  Works ad great on Kindle Fire as it does on my Android mobile phone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen has done it again. This book will have you laughing and crying. I was hooked and couldn't put it down. If you like a good romance with a powerful storyline than this book is for you. I highly recommend it!
0545265355|1.0|The story could have been so much better if the ending wasn't CRAP! Don't waste your time on these books...
B004F4HWPS|5.0|This deluxe box set is complete. The construction is sturdy, the booklet and information is good. The sound quality is GREAT! I have been looking for the audio for this concert for years. A must have for any musical enthusiast, let alone a Marley fan!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it's a great game but after you buy 2 things, the app will not open ever again no matter what you do and Amazon dose not help you with the problem so you have to uninstalll and start over
B0002O7XVI|5.0|I have been looking for this version on DVD, at a reasonable price, for a long time.  So glad to have found it at last!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I love this album. AMAZING guy , amazing work...love you Abel . XO  Everybody that loves good R'n'B...good music in general..should support him and buy this thing ! &#60;3
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Can hardly wait for the rest of Season five; and to own that dvd.  One of the best tv series.
B0063IH60K|4.0|too many ads. just click skip every time without even noticing what they are for. the game is entertaining.worth the trouble.
B008VBYN80|3.0|its a good game to kill time, its not really free, then again nothing really is anymore. anyone needing another friend just send me an invite.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I'd love to learn to play the piano but I have no musical talent with this program there is no one to judge you it is just fun entertainment.
1419705849|5.0|My son who is now 10yrs old used to hate reading. Every night it was a battle. He said, \\"mommy, this books are boring!\\" The next day we went to the book store to find books that interested him. He found the world of diary of a wimpy kid. He was hooked from the first moment he picked up the book. Now my son is interested in reading and he's now waiting for the next book to be published. Thanks Yall..<br />Happy mommy
B00632HWOG|4.0|it is pretty good and  easy to use but when I click on a address to send an e-mail all my contacts appear and block the page so I don't know whether it is sending to all those addresses or just the one in the send window.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love this app. tried a few first,this was the only keeper. love being able to layer sounds and fine tune each effect to my personal preferences.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hugh Howey pulls you in with very short chapters at the beginning of the novel, and then keeps you rapt until the very end.  He puts a very interesting twist on the post apocalyptic novel, and serves it up with some very likable characters that will leave you begging for more.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I've mostly stopped buying movies on DVD/Blu Ray only because I only end up watching them once.  This one is fun to watch due to its creative story, beautiful scenery, and humor. It has just enough of a Woody Allen charm for fans of his films, but not so much that makes it a niche movie.  This also is a movie that doesn't rely on its cast (though its a good one) but more on the fantasy story line, which is terrific for fans of the period, art history, and or the city of Paris.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Sorry I bought this. This CD is average at best and her worst work to date. After 2 listens this is going to be put away forever.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is a great app. a lot of fun. Fun to add your own photos. My grandiose like it also.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is even better than the movies and wi totally make the readers ook at the whole aspect of how the story happened. I completely recommend othe Kindle users to purchase this book!
B009TZBEKW|5.0|A lot of the songs on here are actually quite catchy! Sweet nothing with Florence actually became my favorite<br /><br />A must buy for those of us who actually buy our albums
B0072OFM28|3.0|I have only two problems with the Spartacus Series; It is a well made and realistic (Time Period) drama....except......I'm not sure that the Romans used the F--- Word this much; I stand to be corrected, no problem if I am wrong; It seems to me to be totally unnecessary to constantly say this.....It's like the character is selling drugs on a rough side of town. It really ruins the whole Movie/Show to continually be F-Bombed to oblivion. When I bought this Item, it was very cheap; So cheap I couldn't pass it up; I only watched it once, but it appears the 3rd DVD is scratched in spots, so much so: that a used DVD store won't take it; It was sealed, so either it was sent damaged, or the VERY POOR packaging has caused it; It doesn't seem like a good idea to slide a DVD across cardboard (Especially if you paid list price).
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it love it love it. you will too. dont leave lep hangin. brutha needs yo help. be somebody. lep would do it for you.
B003C1SPX8|5.0|I don't know why, but this (As Well As Many Good Movies, Still Not Released) had to take so long to be released on DVD; One of the greatest live rock performances in history; Mark Knopfler, Guitar Genius, calmly and effortlessly weaves his legendary magic for all to enjoy; Songs for all appetites to appreciate; I remember when this came out on LP (2 LP), how this was a monster album; When I went back and listened to some of the studio versions of some of the songs.......Forget About It........All songs are exponentially better when performed live by Dire Straits. Some people think they can play guitar......try playing it backwards (Or Upside Down) fretting with your picking hand, and picking with your fretting hand. Left handers were at a disadvantage, even then. If you get a chance to watch Woodstock, notice Jimi Hendrix playing his guitar upside down, because he was also left handed. He put the strings in reverse order, and played it up side down; So many of us complain about how hard life is.....and some just grab what they get, and do incredible things.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it this game is so much for the family. my mom myself my sister all love it you have to try it you wont regret it
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love this game so much that I want to get the full vertion of it. my brother is ask much of a lame he doesn't like this game. he is only 10 years old.
B0047SF41G|5.0|Rarely does an action movie include character development, but here it is. If you like pithy dialogue as much as you like technologically advanced alien predators, you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Strangers from earth find themselves stranded on what turns out to be an alien planet. As they try to make their way to safety, they mete out details of their pasts in small doses, and keep you guessing as to their true motives. Along the way, there is plenty of alien battle action.<br /><br />Truly a rarity among science fiction movies and destined to become an underground favorite.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game is the best boat game ever! You cant control the throttle, which adds to the excitement! I recommend it to any need for speed fan!
1594203334|5.0|My wife loves this book and often quotes parts of it to her friends.<br /><br />Neither my wife or I had much experience with kids before we had our own, so there have been a lot of anxious moments. This book helps alleviate a lot of that anxiety by showing that our beliefs about how kids can and should be raised are justified.<br /><br />Children do not have to be picky eaters. Parents can spend time with other parents while their kids entertain themselves. These ideas seem obvious to most people. However, kids know that the squeaky wheel can frequently get the grease. But part of the job of parenting is learning when and how much attention should be spent on children.<br /><br />Are you feeling burned out because your children are sucking up so much of your time and energy? Read this book to find out how to escape the prison in which you have ensconced yourself.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|if I wanted to watch ads all day, I would on my Tv. the amount of ads here is amazingly terrible. do yourself a favor and spend .99 cents for ad free.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Since it updated,  it's not working anymore. I wish I could revert to the old version. Right now my e-mails are not loading and I can't send anything. It's useless and frustrating. The old version worked fine!
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Ive always been a fan of Will Smith's acting. This movie is emotional and passionate while also suspenseful and action filled.
1567184855|5.0|To learn about what your life is like between lives was absolutely fascinating! Some of the spirituality of this book crept into my own. Once you learn something, it becomes part of you and you end up expressing it whether you want to or not. When you die, you go to the Spirit World, review your life, and come back. I don't know about you, but after the life I have had, I never want another one! I read in this book, or in its sequel, that the souls in the Spirit World respect your wish if you choose not to reincarnate. I choose not to reincarnate! It's far too painful down here on Earth. I never want to come back.<br />From Erren Grey Wolf, author of Beneath the Surface: The Lost Boy (Volume 1).<br />[...]
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Started watching this show right before the second season began. My husband and I watched the whole season in three days! This has become my favorite show on TV.<br /><br />Claire Danes does an amazing job in this series. I even bought this season for my mother for Christmas. They always say to give a gift you would love to receive!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!!! You gotta try it!!! I cant stop playing it!!! My son showwd it to me, now I have all my friends playing it!!!
B009ZE27US|2.0|I tried this scanner app several times and it just did not work for me. I just wish I was the age it guesstimated me to be. I tried both thumbs at different positions and it came up with an age of about half my real age. I also had other friends and family try it with similar results. In all fairness I will say it did work better and was a little more accurate on younger subjects.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|As in many franchise movie productions, the first one is usually the best.<br />That holds true with this one too. The second film is good, but does not continue<br />the more personal aspects of their entertaining dialogue. Special effects never<br />compensate for content. Downey and Law are brilliant in their portrayal of their characters.<br />My only minor complaint is that they have taken the liberty of turning Holmes into a<br />\\"Super Hero\\" doing the impossible instead of the unlikely as in Doyles writings.<br />Who better to play an eccentric with a penchant for a 7% solution of cocaine than Downey.<br />I, for one, am thankful for Downey's success in coming out of his addiction and back into the world<br />of entertainment with his flair and superb character development in each of his roles.<br />Great film. Get the Blue ray....definitely!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was a ton of fun to watch.  It made the plane ride fly by.  I am considering purchasing it.  Fun story with great characters.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Well written and easy to read.  It all makes sense.  Want to read all of his books now.  Definitely recommend.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is so much fun I could never be board. it has something about it that make the way it is
B005RYF5JA|4.0|Wonderful concert and the dvd has vivid color, however, the sound track has some noise.  I enjoy the dvd anyway.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its ok cuz it always start me over and some times it get on my nerve.. work some times&divide;never work =3stars
B006M4F67A|5.0|Plenty of variety in the levels to keep you occupied for a long time.  Enjoyable and challenging enough for even those who are not beginners of this game
B009FZHYKU|5.0|How could you go wrong with the best most watched TV show of all time.  The Walking dead is hands down the best Zombie production ever made.
0446554995|3.0|I devoured each volume of this triology as it was published.  Waiting for Two Graves to come out, I reread the first two stories because as a true Preston & Childs fan, I adore Pendergast, and didn't want to miss anything.  Well, maybe I need to reread this one, too,and try to get more involved.  I feel like I have been running and running and ended up back at the beginning, with only a little more time spent watching my strange hero, not really knowing him more.  I realize this is fiction, but in our minds as readers, we want more Pendergast...not the normal convention and stiff manners. A little more vulnerability and passion.  Please, take us closer into his humanity.<br /><br />I enjoyed the writing. It keeps your attention and I love the descriptions they use throughout...I just want...MORE.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and enjoyed the fantasy. I could not put the book down. Read it in 2 days and could not wait to geat to book three.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|there are lots of fun puzzles; graphics are well done; plenty of game time; well worth the price of admission.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The treatment we all hoped would happen did. Sure, there are a few continuity issues and some wtf moment, but they don't really detract from the movie.<br /><br />Except for the Lokey Pokey stick.<br /><br />And Hulk..well this is the Hulk we've been waiting for. Hulk smash and Hulk smash good!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game. The only downsize is the letters and figures are alittle small..other than that, I can play<br />it for hours..
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Okay lets get this out -if you are a fan of Family Guy, then rent the flick. Sure Ted sounds at times a cross between Peter Griffin and Brian the dog, but Seth can only do so much lol.<br /><br />And Ralph Garmen as the Dad..he does voicework for Family Guy, and does Hollywood Babelon podcasts with Kevin Smith. Could have used more of him in the film.<br /><br />And Sam jones...wow whoever came up with him t add spice to the plot..well cool. We don;t see enough Flash in the world now.
B007HACDLK|2.0|I am a Flynn fan but found this one tedious , slow moving definately not a fast read for me.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Yes they are mostly all here - all of your favorite action heros from the 80s flicks. Enjoyalbe movie, if sometimes a bit silly - but hey, most action adventure flicks from the 80s were just that.  Only thing that really made me go come on what contrived bs was the huge cannon in the nose of the plane. Sorry but that plane would have fallen right apart form the recoil. Anyway, rent it, and you;ll geta chuckle or two, and see the high body count.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Love this movie and loved the deal I got -- it's not Blu-Ray, but for $1.96?? (The Blu-Ray was all claimed on the deal already). Great movie and fast shipping~!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Not a bad movie, even if the makeup is a bit over the top. Woody does a good job as usual. Worth ordering to stream.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I didn&#34;t realize I had  the app until I lefted my cell phone @work, which I use as one of my alarms. very simple to use love the new alarm sounds, Thanks
0060899220|4.0|Anthony warns you, this is a book for chefs. But it's also a book for anyone interested in what its like to be a chef in resturants large and small. And, everything inbetween. He is totally irreverent and not ashamed about it. His take about celebrity chefs and well, being a celebrity at all, is interesting to say the least. He is not a fan. Being a chef is hard work. Being a sucessful chef is even more dificult. Want to change careers at say 40 or 50 to open your dream resturant. Think again. Most likely you'll fail.<br />If you like his TV show you'll like the book.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read 50 Shades and a friend (who also read 50) recommended this book. I feel this book is better than 50 in terms of the quality of writing is much better. The storyline is pretty good - exciting and fast paced. At the end of this book I was debating if I would buy the 2nd one, it took me a while to decide. I finally did because I was curious, but I think I could live without knowing what happened next.<br /><br />Overall it was an OK book; I enjoyed reading it but it's not something I would read over and over again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just love this game I think it's a great game to share with family and friends. My grandchildren also have fun playing.
1608871452|5.0|My 13 yr old is a huge supernatural fan. This book is amazing!!! It covers the first 7 seasons, has tons of cool pictures and little trinkets in the book. It has postcards you can pull out, a car freshener, stickers...tons of fun little things throughout the book. It's a big book too. VERY nice...you won't regret it for a supernatural fan.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Not a bad game, keeps me entertained when i am board but worth the try. Not sure if i would recomendthough
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Ok I read this book about a year ago but I was so confused when I saw the movie.  The fighting and killing wasn't what I remembered.  Of course not everyone has a visual mind when they read so they had to sell movie tickets with a lot of action.  I am happy I reread this story, it is a true love story, from all angles.
B00913DPW2|1.0|Can't figure out how to play game, gives no clue as how to begin or what u are suppose to do would not recomend
B005XN0SGU|4.0|The one issue I have with this app is that the bookshelf button doesn't work, it sends me to the home page. I changed the home page to the bookshelf and that solved that issue though. One thing I'll say about the bookshelf is that, for me, it's easier on the eyes and brain if I group the comics by title or reading lists in separate folders within the main bookshelf folder. That way I'm not just looking at a slew of random comics all on one page.
1416987118|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas gift for my nephew. My husband has the book, got when he was a child and now buying for another little boy to cherish story time
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Okay.  I am going to eat a little crow on this one. This movie was not what I expected. I was expecting a less contrived raunchy slapstick comedy.  That being said, I seem to watch this little film EVERY DARN TIME it is on.  So there has to be something there. Right? Even if I still can't figure out what. I still think, given the talent, it could have been better.  However, this movie has launched several people's careers.  Who am I to argue with that or the success of this movie?  Original Review (1 star) I have been waiting for this film's release; as I could not get out to the theater to see it.  I was expecting something ala &#34;Waiting for Guffman&#34;.  What I got was a blend of &#34;Bring it On&#34; meets who knows what.  Even the gifted talent in this movie could't make this stink bomb smell better.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The Bone Bed is one of Patricia Cornwell's best. She finally got back to the good & interesting. Not a sleeper.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Listen, there isn't a whole lot more to be said about this book. It's value is that Sledge just lays it out, more like he's talking to you than writing for you. That intimacy will hold you from the first page and make you take a little more jaundiced view, perhaps, of rah-rah military books. Worth ever minute you will put into it.
B0032O6S4I|5.0|This is a well-made toy with endless play value and lots of little details that kids like.  My grandchildren love it. Worth the price.  Was delivered quickly and in great shape.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Started out okay and then seemed to bog down in lengthy descriptions. This story could have been told in fewer pages. I will, however, try her again.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great app for anyone, young or old. When I'm bored I know I can use this app to entertain myself.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I enjoyed seeing the film after reading the series. Jennifer Lawrence played the part perfectly.  There were things missing from the book, but that usually happens when books get adapted to film.  I still look forward to seeing the sequel.
B00AMBMF1Y|4.0|I have no further comments and don't like that I'm &#34;required&#34; to do more than choose stars when my rating is supposed to be voluntary /:
006441034X|5.0|This book is outstanding! It is easily my favorite book with its magic,its beautiful plot and well developed charecters make you fall in love with the cowardly Howl pen-dragon. This book is great for all ages and anyone seeking to escape the real world and fall into something brand new and exciting.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The best show of this milenium, saw by 18.000 lucky fans from 50 countries ! The performance is remarkable and the quality of the sound and video is oustanding. The deluxe edition with the full reherseal four days before the gig is a must have to all Zep fans. I got a huge collection of DVDs and a not so big of blu-rays and this one is the best, for sure !
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|What a mellow album of some favorites as well as a couple of surprises in that famous, low-key, comfortable way James Taylor has of making you feel loved.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I don't know if there is a compatibility issue. I have an Archos 80 G9 and it never downloaded. Maybe I will try again later in the future.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Love the sound effects and retromess of this game. It was just like the first. Eat the ghosts and power up.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next one. I love all his series. It's more serious than his other series has been. Hope the next one has a little more comedy.
B009NPK1IO|3.0|I felt that this was a good time to end the show.  They had pretty much done as much with it as they could.  I enjoyed all six seasons though!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Best game I have ever played on kindle fire I would love it if they would keep adding to it. I like the snow level too.
B0034G4P80|5.0|received product well before estimated delivery date and the product was exactly as described.  if you are a fan of all the other marvel movies you will love this
B0063GORYU|5.0|love the game and this program works well, never any problems or glitches no matter how long I continuously play.
B00933JL0A|5.0|Townsmen is a cute game, you don't have to buy extras with real world money. Like other games which means kiddos can play.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was even better than I anticipated. My husband was so unhappy when I asked him to watch it. He was like &#34;It's like Glee or something?&#34; NO! It isn't! As it turns out he LOVED this movie. In fact right when it was over he watched it again! It was hilarious with a great story line and I was really impressed. Rebel Wilson is HILARIOUS! I'm so happy that I bought this movie. I almost NEVER buy movies either. This is the second movie I bought thee entire year!
B004UFEJW6|4.0|Forget that this was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (even though he handles it competently enough) and remember that it was written by David Webb Peoples, who scribed Blade Runner and Unforgiven (one of the greatest scripts of all time). This is an intelligent, thoughtful film with a heartbreaking, near-silent performance from Kurt Russell, playing a brainwashed super-soldier who, after being rendered obsolete by a newer breed of warrior, struggles to understand what it means to be human. This really isn't even an action movie until the finale, but when it does kick into that gear, it does so pretty spectacularly.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|This might be a game for a beginner.  It is very cute, but slow. Nice, if you're a Hello Kitty Fan. But, not challenging enough.
B006PTL1GC|3.0|A Dangerous Method certainly can't be accused of a lack of ideas. During it's all-too-brief 99-minute running time, it attempts to tackle the birth and eventual dissolution of the friendship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, Jung's almost subconscious dissatisfaction with his family life, the torrid, potentially destructive affair Jung has with one of his patients, a major load of various psychosexual and philosophical themes, and the birth of psychoanalysis and - eventually, in many ways - modern psychology. That's a whole lot to heap on one film's plate. And that's just the problem; it is simply far too much to satisfactorily explore with any real depth in a mere 99 minutes. In order to succeed, one of two things needed to be done:<br /><br />1. Expand this to at least three hours.<br /><br />2. More realistically, choose one of those ideas and explore it at length. Wrench every last drop of psychological drama and substance from it. Use it to present a small, focused set of themes and ideas that form a film with substance. Use them to suggest something interesting. Use them to say something about human nature. Use them to do anything memorable!<br /><br />Instead, screenwriter Christopher Hampton seems too married to all of the different story elements of his own play to effectively edit out what may be unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Personally, I think this would have been most interesting had it focused solely on the relationship between Jung and Freud; what initially connects them and unites them as colleagues, and the eventual personal and ideological conflicts that inevitably lead to their parting ways, and what could arguably be considered a rivalry. But all of the other pieces of the film - mainly the relationship between Jung and his mentally unstable mistress - get in the way of that potentially fascinating storyline and, as a result, everything the film presents feels surface level, as if we're only seeing the tip of the proverbial iceberg.<br /><br />There may be no type of film more frustrating than A Dangerous Method - a film so rich with ideas and so unsure of what to do with them.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I liked this for my purposes. I needed to check melody flow and pitch since I do not have a working keyboard or a piano. I allows me to check the melody line for my choir songs without waiting for rehearsal.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This has got to be the most heartbreakingly delicate film I've ever seen, thanks largely to Fairuza Balk's tender performance and Walter Murch's surreal, careful direction. Murch seems to have put a painstaking amount of detail into this - the film is bursting at the seams with psychological hints and allusions that reveal themselves more and more upon repeat viewings. Beautiful, moving, quite frightening at times, and ultimately unforgettable. Forget the moderately enjoyable Wizard - Return is the real masterpiece of this series.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is a excellent movie to watch and have as a collector's piece. Real Navy Seals were the actors in this movie making the plot and scenes very believeable. If you love your armed forces who protect this country and others, purchase and watch this movie to learn more about their job and their lives.
B007G5K066|2.0|Subtlety can be a tricky thing. In the hands of a craftsman like Elia Kazan, it can be the pathway to a masterpiece. But in the new adaptation of John le Carre's espionage novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, director Tomas Alfredson banks on the trait so heavily that the rather simple narrative at the film's core is quickly lost in a convoluted mess of long pauses, meaningful glances, and generally frustrating storytelling.<br /><br />It should be noted that this approach works wonders during the film's opening ten minutes or so. The early sequence of a potentially volatile meeting between two edgy gentlemen looking very intense and covert unfolds with palpable tension and remarkable attention to detail, playing out almost like a description-for-description visualization of a novel. However, this alluring scene - followed by a silently character-developing credits sequence - is as far as the thrill goes. Things unravel quickly as characters, subplots, and flashbacks are introduced and subsequently passed over in a whirlwind of information that, upon closer examination, really isn't all that complex. It's just that Alfredson wants us to believe that it is. This decidedly impenetrable structure is the film's ultimate undoing, as it creates an uninterested distance in the audience and renders the proceedings dreadfully dull and boring. In the end, Alfredson favors intricacy over forward momentum and forced style over character development. When the identity of the mole in MI6 is finally revealed, all one can muster is a disinterested shrug, as one can hardly tell the difference between any of the suspects in the first place.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|I may be right in a game that I might have gotten a good time and it freezes and it also switches to another game while I'm doing one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Onto number 3.  Such a good read a 60yr old can enjoy it. Exciting and action packed with life and death.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This movie is excellent. The actors and actresses did a wonderful job on there parts.<br />Very action oriented. Action flick fans will love this one.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I have a kindle fire a i downloaded this game but it required additionnal 848 mb. I think that it will never have a success like this. Yalla galops la choops
B009VB97EY|3.0|I liked it a lot. Especially the men dancing.<br />I didn't realize it had to do with drugs though!<br />But all in all good movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Again, Connelly hits the mark right on.  Great mystery, action, keeps you hanging til the very end.  A worthy read.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was the cutest movie! And no violence. Loved it.<br />All the different personalities, and the surprise at the end!
B000TEMRXA|4.0|Great music. The 80's were very good to me. This album brings back a lot of fond memories that I will keep with me forever. This was an album played a lot at my high school dances. I would recommend this album to any of my fellow 80's children.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its ok, I enjoy playing,  but the energy runs out to fast &amp; not enough rewards,need to have more diamonds.shouldn't have to us money.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|IF YOU CAN GET THIS AND ALL YOU WHANT IS DVD FORMAT ( NOT THE BLUE-RAY) THAN YOU WILL BE VERRY HAPPE
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I randomly stumbled across this series, but I couldn't put it down after starting.  The worst thing was, I  was very disappointed that the storyline had to come to an end.  I really hope Howey picks up where he left off!
B0092MJOMW|5.0|All the songs are high pace and adrenilizing. My favorite song on this album is Altar of Sacrifice. Great album from one of the greatest death (thrash) metal bands of all time. This is an essential album for all death metal listeners. Enjoy as I did.
B0099114WO|1.0|This movie has an awesome cast. I was soooo looking forward to a great movie. HOWEVER, this movie was soooo slow and boring and not even funny. I honestly fell asleep watching it.
B007TK77QE|1.0|In would love to give a review but unfortunately I have not been able to download the book onto my Kindle and very disappointed
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The book started out slow. About halfway through I could not put it down! Sadly, the ending was a disappointment.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting sometimes I can't even get myself to stop playing. If you have nothing to do I suggest this game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is an incredible story. I finished this book the day before I went to the movie and I cannot tell you how glad I am that I had the fortune to read the book first!
B009ZE27US|1.0|When I saw this app I thought it would be fun and I was WRONG! This app was a complete waste!!
B003MC5N28|1.0|I read this book because a young adult friend of mine recently started a philosophical discussion using it as a springboard. I was immediately disappointed in the overly simplistic way in which the author puts together her ideas. However, it was a quick read and I was able to finish it easily within a couple of days. It was a stark contrast to the book by a Japanese author which I had just finished reading.<br /><br />Obviously, a person who writes this sort of book has an agenda to comment on her  society - to warn about trends that she sees afoot, and to offer some ideas for potential solutions. That's what visual artists would call the \\"grand narrative.\\" I also imagine that there is a \\"lesser narrative\\" as well - that is to say it may be something of an allegory for some aspect of her own relationship to the world.<br /><br />I can see why this book spoke to the heart of my friend. I compare it to a similar book (and series) I read when I was young - the \\"White Mountains\\" by John Christopher (pen name for Samuel Youd). Certain very caring and smart young people who find that they don't really fit in, here in the culture of the USA, latch on to these kind of stories as being those which might possibly provide guidance for them as they seek to navigate their social problems. I just wish that the authors of such books would have more of a sense of nuance of the problems and possible solutions for these young people before they set pen to paper - that is, if they really are trying to serve the needs of that type of kid.<br /><br />I can see how Lois Lowry ticked off all the boxes when she was designing the plot of \\"the Giver\\" - she was careful to cater to all the preconceptions (prejudices) within the sensibilities of the American reader population. She even included a Christ-like figure in the book. Because of this practice, I feel the book ends up as a hollow and empty shell of what it could have been. The author does not seek to challenge her readers and share newinsights, but instead her book becomes a perfectly resounding part of the echo chamber of the way that left-leaning American thinkers see the framework of the problems of society around them.<br /><br />However, I suppose this is exactly why it is popular, and why it has become an award winning novel. People will only devote the time to reading things which confirm what they already feel about how the world works.<br /><br />Children's novels need to use simple language, but there's no need for simplistic ideas. I would have also appreciated a more realistic character arc for Jonas. It's odd that his big decision to leave his community comes out of nowhere and becomes decided upon in his mind over the scope of three or four pages of the book.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as a stocking stuffer. It is by far one of the funniest and best Christmas movies!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This was a fun read. It took me some time to ge through it and it seemed to slow down at times but I really liked it. It was hard to keep track of the time frame in the books as it jumps around. The author was great at describing the characters and settings and the illusions in the circus and it was very easy to picture everything. I imagined it being very 'Tim Burton-esque'. I can't wait to see the movie when it's completed. It should be interesting to see how some of the stories play out on screen.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|the pen is what i was looking or in terms of form factor - i wanted a large pen for use with gloves - but the sensitivity on this pen is so low as to make it unusable at times. it is simply going back. nice idea, bad implementation
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I couldn't stop playing this game! Ended up buying the full version, but totally worth it. It had a good story line and challenging puzzles.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|My daughter LOVES it. She plays it or watches it all the time.  Thanks it's great.  Really think this purchase was worth it.
B004JNB4UO|4.0|Nothing like making &#34;Dugout Doug&#34; look his finest and brightest. My uncle served directly under him and while some of the movie is true, a lot was left out. If anyone bothers to read a &#34;good&#34; book about MacArthur, you will see what I mean. Don't bother with the book entitled, &#34;American Caesar&#34; by William Manchester published in 1978, it also is just a pontification of Doug. Don't get me wrong, he was and still is considered one of our greatest generals, but if you delve deep you will find that a lot of his problems were of his own making and his ego got in the way of quite a few things. However, the movie is a good romp through a war in the style of both John Wayne and John Ford.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Quite frankly, it was one of the best movies I've seen in years.  Yes, it is almost 3 hours long, but I have no clue why people would give this 3 stars or less.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed the book but some additional plot twists would have been nice:  we could see most, if not all, of what played out.
B0002TKFR2|5.0|This is a great CD. I already had a CD of Heifetz playing the Mendelssohn but only had him playing the Beethoven on tape. This provides over 62 minutes of fantastic listening. Over the years I have tried to decide which violin concerto I like best; Beethoven, Mendelssohn or Tchaikovsky (the Bruch so far is in fourth). They are all different and wonderful but I have finally decided that the one I am listening to is the one I like best.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A boy and an adult Bengal tiger in a life boat together floating through the Pacific Ocean.  Seems unbelievable?  It is.  I was not expecting such a strong religious theme.  It was a good book though, worth a read for sure.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch at his best with a few twists thrown in to keep the reader in suspense.<br />An excellent read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series. Captures the essence of late victorian culture in all of its hubris, temerity and ignorant brutality. Fine performances from all. One of the best shows currently running.
B00785P2QC|4.0|if they make it eazzyer to get energy it whould be 5 star but till the its 4 fun fun fun
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Being a Kristen Stewart fan was mainly what drove my powerful interest in this film. She is the only reason I enjoy the Twilight films and I figured there would be a similar effect in Snow White. Having seen it three times now, I can definitely say that she is not the only draw, and is also not the only enjoyable thing about the film. Snow White & the Huntsman sets out to be this sweeping, big-budget action/fantasy epic with a grandiose story (and soundtrack). It only partially succeeds, but what's there is still (to me) an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />The main problem the film suffers from is a lack of consistent pacing and tone. There are many important scenes which drive the emotional bond between characters, whether it's between Snow White, the dwarves, Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman, or a combination of the three. These scenes are done well, but the transitions between them and the action sequences in the film are often messy. We are often jolted from action to emotion in weird and awkward ways at times, and it disrupts the natural flow. Still, the final product is worthwhile and still succeeds (through fantastic performances from its stars, most notably Charlize Theron) even as it suffers from weak transitions and pacing.<br /><br />The audio quality and picture quality are fantastic, and the set comes with a number of interesting extras that really delve into the production and costume design for the film, as well as the thought process behind bringing a darker, grittier version of the Snow White fairytale to the screen.<br /><br />As it stands, Snow White and the Huntsman is a missed opportunity for what could have been a genuine summer blockbuster. However it is still worth a watch and the blu-ray boasts excellent audio and picture quality, as well as a healthy dose of extras. Recommended.
B00384NXX6|5.0|great movie and  a good price, what else is better than all these guys in a movie together. a must get
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have followed this character since book 1.The ONLY thing I don't like is that Harry is aging. But I guess so am I.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Ok, I have officially added myself to the gushing masses of a 5 star rating. He is just that good! You know how you buy a CD and expect nothing but great music? Well, just how often do you buy one blind and get the satisfaction of every song sounding great? Yeah I thought so, same here. Not so with Joe! I have yet to be let down. Got more to buy though but this one I can listen to without any buyers remorse than accompanies so much of &#34;todays&#34; music.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I have a three year old and a five year old. This is a wonderful movie. Good lesson and well done for their age group. Combo pack is great. We have blu-ray at home. G-ma and papa only have DVD and the digital copy is great for long car rides. We split up the pack and are happy all around.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really enjoy this game, for it is not too complicated and a mystery at the same time! Also, I let my mom's friend's kids try it and they would not let go ofnmy kindle! now what does that say? ;)
B003RNXIBK|3.0|I am a lot older than most of his fans. But, I understand him and appreciate what he does. This particular album only has 3 songs on it I really appreciate.
B002VECMAE|3.0|the ordering process for this movie was fine. the movie was just not what i expected after seeing the trailers. interesting story line that did lead to further research on the subject. would not recommend as entertainment.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Bane is not the best bad guy in the series and the douche bag that plays batman is just a douche bag.
B002RI9ZUE|4.0|The book is a dark telling of the authors trails with mental health. She writes beautifully, but at times not in the most coherent of ways and there were a few spelling errors I blame the editor for which add to the confusion. I'd have given the story five stars had it not been for the confusing errors.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Stupid movie for stupid people. Its exactly what you would expect no plot surprises no thought provoking scenes. Hollywood just doesn't seem to care anymore.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Relies too heavily on pay-to-play features, but it's nice for a free game. Decent graphics and sound. Play time not very long for those that don't want to use real cash.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Not kid friendly, too much potty mouth, however,it had a few good laughs.  rainy afternoon kind of movie. I like Mark Wahlberg
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Any age 12+.  Gain mental images before a movie does it for you. Great trilogy. Wraps up the series nicely.

B000PMG16U|1.0|for my generation, there is only one \\"episode 1\\" and that's \\"Star Wars: A New Hope.\\" the prequels don't tell a single bit of backstory worth knowing before watching it. Lucas used the prequel series to explore new technologies. the result is a bunch of already-dated effects work and an awful overabundance of green screen.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|i would consider this 2- disc set to be  a good cataloguing of this songstress' hits and misses from her career. have heard others cite issues on the audio quality, but i would only say that the menu had the music too loud. i was able to get okay audio once i had pressed the audio button on my player's remote to change from the default audio to Dolby 2.1. the default did not sound good ,especially when listening through wireless headphones. i would have also thought that the packaging could have been a bit more inclusive, such as having a booklet with info and photographs. the sleeve photo wasn't anything great as far as i'm concerned either, i've seen better pictures of Madonna, and since this was a 25 year career - spanning compilation, i think it should have been presented with a lot more flair. would consider the video portion acceptable, but not the best.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I hate to write this review because I enjoyed this author's other book \\"Slammed\\" a good bit. But, this book seems that it was rushed to market to piggyback off her recent success. Recently, she raved about a book called the \\"Sea of Tranquility\\" which I read because of her review. As I started reading this book, it appeared as if she had taken that successful plot and just recreated it in this book. There are so many similarities that it is laughable. Two teens with secret pasts. A new girl at school with a reputation she chooses to play into. Heroine is a sugar addict and loves to bake. Running is her hobby. There are just too many similarities to mention in this review, but I was very disappointed in this book. Maybe she intended this to be fan fiction, but I didn't think so.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game comes with a great story line, it's fun, exciting, everything you want it to be. On the kindle fire, you are asked to pay $2.99 and on the iPad you are asked to pay $6.99. On whatever device you're on, it's worth the pay.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really love this game but sometimes it freezes and makes me crash but other than that very addictive and fun.
B008JF8O9M|3.0|Still need a direct Wi-Fi app to print without going through Google..It does print but would rather just go from my phone straight in.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Lots of action but in my opinion not as good as the three preceding Bourne movies. Waiting for the sequel to see if the storyline gets better.
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|When I heard it was coming out in the android appstore I was really excited, but when it wouldn't install I was pissed. Amazing game, but it just wouldn't work and I payed 2.99!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game that merges the classic Star Wars and the recent hit Angry Birds.  Game play is smooth, challenging and fun.  Love it.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Everything up until Revolver sounds much better in mono. You can actually hear the drums and bass. After that it could go either way. Pepper is very good in mono and quite different. Rubber Soul sounds AMAZING. Almost worth buying the box for this alone.<br /><br /> They should have had both Stereo and Mono on each CD as the albums are short enough to fit. Maybe charge a bit more.<br /><br />Re-mixes anyone?
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I thought this would have been funnier than it was........glad I did not buy offer go to the theater to watch.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I love this album so much, I purchased on release , the vinyl album, when things changed to 8 track, caset, then Cds, it has always been one of my first replacements ( along with Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon. Only thing left to say \\"buy it\\".

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoy Colleens books so much.  She really digs into your inner emotions with her tales of love and hardship.  Keep up the great work.  Wonderful book to read!
B005PSG4JS|5.0|After reading this book and knowing that Rubin Carter is a free man, I still wonder what kind of Justice we have in this country.All the conspirators that sent this innocent man to live the rest of his life behind bars are free, yet I know that there are still bigots and racists in this country that believe that Rubin Carter committed this outrageous crime. The real murderers were never caught, and the conspirators who sent an innocent man to prison were never punished. American Justice System?
B003BOUKRU|5.0|I couldn't rate Céline or make any comments. Simply MAGIC AMAZING WONDERFUL PRETTY LOVING CARING. A real DIVA. Love so much!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This CD has some of my favorite songs on it such as:<br />The Prayer<br />The Voice<br />and Scarborough Fair<br /><br />I love this music and Celtic Woman has an amazing sound. I just wished that my seller had been more descriptive with the condition as my copy didn't come with a Irish Charm.<br /><br />Other than that, GREAT!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I bought this collection for  $1.00. The stories are timeless and the illustrations a great. I always loved mystery stories and this is classic mystery.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book ever read it in two days. Could not put it down. Read this book you won't regret it
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I won't give you the info to spoil you.  I will say that if you don't know what this film is about, but you are a die hard Sci-Fi fan, you'll love this film.  The film is slow to get going, and I originally rated it about a 3.5...you know, one of those films you can have going in the background while you do your Sunday chores.  However, it got my full attention in the last minute of the show.  And it got the 5.0 rating.  And after the ending, and you're sitting there, thinking to yourself, mentally taking stock of all the stuff you thought seemed familiar...you finally realize all that came before and all that can come from tomorrow.  This might seem cryptic, but it's because you need to see this film.  Trust me, you won't regret it.
B008220D5K|4.0|\\"This Is 40\\" is a sequel of sorts for two characters which first appeared in Judd Apatow's 2007 \\"Knocked Up\\" movie. Now 5 years later, we catch up with these characters, Pete and Debbie (played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, a/k/a Mrs. Apatow in real life) along with their daughters Sadie and Charlotte (played by the real-life daughters of the Apatows).<br /><br />\\"This Is 40\\" (2012 release; 133 min.) starts off as the family is getting ready to celebrate Debbie's 40th birthday, only the cake reads 38 as Debbie does not want to face up to her real age. Soon we see Pete and Debbie arguing over petty things, and also life's larger issues, between themselves and also with their daughters. At one point, when 13 yr. old Sadie keeps watching old \\"Lost\\" episodes much to the chagrin of Pete and Debbie, Iris exclaims \\"'Lost' is not melting my brain, it is blowing my mind!\\". At one point, Pete and Debbie take off for a weekend without the kids and that helps things a bit, but not for long. In the second half of the movie, as they prepare for a big party at home for Pete's 40th birthday, things keep going downhill. Will Pete and Debbie save their marriage? Will they find a truce with Sadie? To say more would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />A number of comments: first off, the movie's writing is sharp from start to finish, and I found myself chuckling a lot, if not outright laughing. At one point when Pete and Debbie are arguing again, Pete extols in exasperation: \\"We're like Simon & Garfunkel and you've turned me into Garfunkel\\", to which Debbie responds: \\"What's wrong with that? Garfunkel has a beautiful voice!\\". The one thing that seemed a bit strange to me is that money (in particular the lack of it) is a big issue for Pete and Debbie, as they argue about it a LOT, with Pete's business not doing well and Debbie's clothing store also struggling, yet somehow they live in a million-dollar house, the kids attend private school, and there is a BMW and Lexus in the driveway... There is an amazing array of side characters in the movie, and of all of them, Melissa McCarthy makes the most of her small role (basically replicating the character she played in Bridesmaids), make sure you don't miss the outtake when the credits role, you'll see why..., but Chris O'Dowd (who also appeared in Bridesmaids) shines as Pete's trusted employee. Last but certainly not least, music plays a key role in the movie, with Pete as the head of a small and struggling record label, and there is a nice side-story involving Graham Parker and the Rumor. (The excellent movie soundtrack is available on CD.) In all, I found \\"This Is 40\\" to be Judd Apatow's most mature and ultimately most satisfying movie to date. Not just a comedy, it brings a great look at life in general. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!nd there is a BMW and Lexus in the driveway...

B007QPFGJW|5.0|As always, Nesbo has written a great book.  Harry Hole stories are exciting and thoughtful.  Looking forward to see what Nesbo writes next!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|If you come across a book by this author, do yourself a favor and read it!  The way he interweaves his interesting, believable, and well-planned characters never disappoints, and more often than not, exceeds expectation.<br /><br />Red Country is that latest in the adventures of the nine-fingered Northman, getting on and years and seemingly mellowing with age.  That is, until the opportunity to kill lots of people arises.  Unlike most killers, this one feels bad about it, and even though he laments about being a killer, you know Joe Abercrombie will not give him a break.<br /><br />Thank you again for an entertaining read.
B0086DBE62|3.0|Kids will love it, just enough laughs and adventure. Graphics are great too. Just too smarmy for me and I do like kids movies.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|This is the best Freecell game. I especially like being able to use my own pictures for the background.  I would recommend this to anyone. In fact I did soto my sister.
B0035LJZ1Q|4.0|Dark, atmospheric, just enough creepy towns people to keep you guessing who it may be or what it may be. Not too bad.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this in a day and a half while on vacation.  I just couldnt put it down.  It was a very easy read and enjoyed it very much.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Thought a tad expensive though since this season was abbreviated due to Emily Deschanel having a child. I love the characters and the stories. I am a true Bones fan.
B005ZUR724|4.0|Not every good<br />I can't do the new update witch is really dumd this is the reason I'm deliting it sorry
0316228532|4.0|The first 1/3 is drudgery I must admit, but once you get (and remember) who the main characters are, it really takes off. It's not really an adventure book, it's more of a thought-provoking book about living in a small town and how those people affect the others, in ways never seen. I look forward to her next adult book.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Being a big horror fan, I was very satisfied with this product.  It was actually a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it!  The zombie head is creepy as hell.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was close to the book and was interesting. My husband, who didn't read the story, liked it. It did end totally different from what I was expecting and the action was goosed up for the film. Not exactly the story line, but close enough. Will probably watch the rest of the series.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Pitch Perfect is very predictable, but cute in its own right. Music was good. It is an enjoyable movie if you are not expecting a blockbuster.
B008EQIJQO|4.0|- it could have gone there, but didn't. Well direct, well acted (especially since there are very few silent movie actors left) - silent film acting is totally different from what we are used to. Both actors were very good in their roles, though the movie did have a predictable ending and of course the dog is there for comic relief. This is more a re-telling of a classic story that than anything new. Great for a movie night with the family.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a amazing game and I can't wait till I have a ton of dragons but still it must give us free rubys!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Wow, who knew Charlize was so mean? Loved this movie, especially since Kristen Stewart has very few lines so she doesn't destroy the film. Liked the whole premise and setting of this film. Well done.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good except for the periodic glitches l even lost some money I had purchased . buyer beware but the game is very addictive.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game was very captivating and had me entertained the whole time.  I played it on my Samsung Galaxy III which has a large screen.  The game has great color, nice music as well as puzzles that are not so difficult that becomes frustrating.  I recommend it.

1451695195|5.0|I was stunned to see this book featured in Newsweek because it was written by the neurosurgeon who operated on my husband. I immediately ordered it and read every word. In the past I've read NDE accounts and wanted to believe, but was not really convinced. Because I KNOW Dr. Alexander and respect his brilliance and integrity I DO believe. For me to think that my husband and grand daughter could be experiencing heaven as he did is enormously comforting!
B007C9N4H8|5.0|The Muppets is a perfect movie. So many of us who grew up with Star Wars felt the prequels were....of the mark. I'd wager there's a huge overlap of Star Wars fans and Muppets fans, and when this movie was coming around, trepidation is putting it gently. Will it be a sell out to trying to appeal to Kids Today? Will it be pure homage? Will my kids hate it such that The Muppets can't be transgenerational?<br />No.<br />The Muppets is a brilliant blend of sentiment with kid jokes, grown up (family-friendly) laughs, a taste of the past, a view of the future, with smashing music numbers. Basically, it's like The Muppets. of Jim Henson.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I believe the Dark Knight series is the best trilogy ever made.  Sorry Frodo and friends.  Christopher Nolan created a character that is both human and inhuman.  Batman will go out to save the world (or Gotham City) but he cannot save himself.  The &#34;exit&#34; of the Dark Knight is seen when the Dark Knight rises.  Best movie of the last few years.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Excellent fun loving encounter of two people who DO NOT want to experience love, but in the end find that they are meant for each other.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies of our generation. Seth Macfarlane and Mark Wahlberg are s great pair. I highly recommend this movie if you are in the mood for some raunchy laughs.
B00AB0AXU6|5.0|We are die-hard Resident Evil fans and went to the movies to see this one.  It was so much better than the last one which was disappointing.  It was non stop action and had a great setup at the end for the next one(which I hope will come out soon!).  For people who whine about a plot in a zombie movie, seriously?  It's a zombie movie, do you really expect a more complicated plot other than kill the zombies and try to stay alive?  If you love Alice and the Resident Evil series, this is a must see.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I purchased this movie for my grandparents, who loved it dearly when we all saw it together back whn it was in theaters. They also have the soundtrack and are brought back to that Christmas whenever they listen or watch. Highly recommend this well made animated film<br /><br />Hot chocolate!
B007MDB71O|3.0|... to make this above average action film one of the most colossal \\"bombs\\" in cinematic history.<br /><br />What the hell happened here?  The theater I was in was pretty full, the local reviewers were pleasantly indulgent towards it, it wasn't universally reviled or hated by everyone.  Why did it fail so catastrophically?<br /><br />What we have in the movie is basically the quintessential MIGHTY WHITEY action/adventure film, featuring a badass caucasian man placed in a foreign world and becoming the greatest warrior/leader/tap-dancer of them all and bringing peace to the realm.  Considering this story was written around 1917, when those sort of stories were still all the rage (Lord Jim, Robinson Crusoe, etc) there was really nothing they could rightly do, other than to make the helpless natives white too.<br /><br />Pretty much all the common clich&egrave;s and tropes associated with films like Dances With Wolves, James Cameron Presents: Dances With Wolves 2: The Smurfs Edition in 3D, are in this film.  The way it's played straight by all the cast almost puts it beyond reproach; it's less like a tired rehashed story requiring almost no effort to write, and more like the honest, genuine efforts of a first-time writer or filmmaker.  Whether the filmmakers are doing their first movie or not is irrelevant.<br /><br />Simplistic as all the elements are, it's only fair to approach them simplistically, and for a simple story, characters and dialogue are surprisingly good, just on the very brink of being dumb, plodding, but avoiding it either by being sparse and plain, or by sheer earnestness.  Even John Carter stops being a boring little twit at some point in and fits more comfortably into his role (though a better actor would have done marvels).<br /><br />The aliens themselves are at their best when they're utterly unphased by any turn of events, as if what they said was absolutely right; they are not the cause of the disaster and horrors, but simply feeding upon the naturally occurring collapse of civilizations.<br /><br />In all, it's hardly consistent with a catastrophic Hollywood bomb, and certainly deserves more than the sort of money churned by even worse action films like Battleship.ly occurring collapse of civilizations.<br /><br />In all, it's hardly consistent with a catastrophic Hollywood bomb, and certainly deserves more than the sort of money churned by even worse action films like Battleship.
B008602KQI|5.0|My title has little to do with the review except a poorly executed reference to the theme of this story. Was actually quite surprised how well the movie followed the book and portrayed a story written entirely in the first person (katniss). Recommend you watch it, but PLEASE make sure you read the trilogy first.
B00571F26Y|5.0|After reading the book and putting it in to practice I feel great.  I lost nearly 10% of my body weight in 3-4 weeks and can go all day with very little food.  My day no-longer revolves around the constant need for high-energy food. The book has completely changed my approach to food and given me an insight into the negative effects of a high-carb diet.  I consider myself very lucky to have stumbled across a recent newspaper article about the effects of wheat that led me to this book!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I love but it takes another whole 105mb after you install the first 7mb other wise I would give it 5 stars
B0071T4BVC|1.0|was hoping for .. a little more..  something similar to his earlier works ... so.. was a little dissapointed. but.. it's okay.. easy listen...
B0086700CM|3.0|At first I loved th game and never put it down. But After a while it got kinds boring!!. But I like that you do not really need Sufi.
B000Q7ZO8U|1.0|We bought the video and book thinking that it would be a fun Christmas tradition to start.  Boy were we wrong...the train ride is scary, the hobo has a very creepy laugh, comes across as more of a criminal than a Christmas spirit.  The North Pole reminded me of my travels in East Germany and many of the other Stalinist Soviet Union places I have been.  I almost gave it two stars because my boys loved the hot chocolate scene, best part of the movie, and a few other small parts; but I decided against because it was just a little too creepy overall.  Also, would it have hurt the producers to have the elves smile on a few occasions?
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Its was such a good series I bought the books, and they are just as good with a lot more detail, its great.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Loved it. I like how the relationship grew and the back story of the mystery with the back story. I did get tired of the sex
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|I look forward too Part 2 of the Dark Knight Returns. I only wish when they had Peter Weller doing the dialog, that they would of had him say what he was thinking during the course of the story. Like they did in the book. One example was when he carried the mutant up too the highest point in Gotham, he didn't say anything. In the book he thought, \\"It was tough work carrying 210 pounds of psychopath up the Gotham Towers, (sorry I don't remember if he said towers or not), the highest point in Gotham, Just the scream alone was worth it!!\\" Or when he tackles Two-Face's gang on his return. When he pulls a punk down from under the floor, he doesn't say anything. In the book, he says, \\"Welcome too Hell!!\\" Course the animation is well done, just like Frank Miller's version long ago.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|While I applaud this series ... the Anne Frank part was over the top, not scary or funny .. just kinda lame
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game, rather addicting. The only drawback is how quickly you loose energy and how much real money you need to spend in order to get the better upgrades.

B0062NAX1U|1.0|In recent years there has been a trend of very loudly Christian individuals embracing cinema and new media both, to spread their message of a) the personal need to seek virtue and b) the need to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with that. Nothing in what I just said necessitates bad art. The problem is that the individuals in question seem to care very little about trying to make *good* art, and the result is a focus on the Moral of The Story without any of the pieces that would make that have any kind of impact. The acting is poor, the pacing is odd, and the plot rambles from one odd episode to the next, with only the bookends really connected to each other.<br /><br />You might enjoy this, if you are the kind of person who can un-ironically enjoy the worst of television and film, but, as a religious person myself, I would beg you to spend your money elsewhere. We deserve better than this. We deserve objectively good films that can appeal to anyone, rather than films which will do more harm than good to the public appearence of american religious communities by the implication here that we care not about doing a good job, not about praising our creator by making something truly good and beautiful, but only about preaching the same tired sentence (&#34;you must accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior&#34;) over and over again.<br /><br />Recent films you might want to enjoy instead:<br /><br />Ida (if you're ok with subtitles)<br />The Tree of Life<br />Calvary<br />Silence<br /><br />In the comments to this review, people complained that Hollywood refuses to make Christian movies; this is untrue. Hollywood does not make bad apologetics movies. Good movies about God and Christianity can be and are made, movies that wrestle with the problems and complexities of religion; Terrance Malick is the most significant person making religious movies today, though the McDonagh brothers are obviously both intensely concerned with Christianity and its struggle in a modernist world. If you are willing to look beyond the English speaking world, you'll find more examples. If you're willing to look across the past century, you'll find that many of the individuals whom even the most liberal of hollywood elites regard as titans of film, people like Tarkovsky or Bergman, are Christian individuals who made incredible religious films.<br /><br />Again, my point was we deserve better-- so spend your money on better.world.

B00005YU1O|5.0|my art teacher had us watch this in school and ive been in love with it since. If I had to guess how many times Ive watched this I would say like 20 times. Its so wild that I learn something new each time and there's something I hadn't noticed before. Its really  my favorite movie.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Fun game. Easy to play. It is also fun to customize the cards with personal pictures and really make the game your own.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It takes up your time building your own little world. Its a little different than the xbox edition but still fun.
B000JML90Y|5.0|This was the first time I had actually read Charles Darwin.  I should warn the reader that going through book is a bit like taking a semester long college course. If you are unwilling to do this I recommend skipping it.  I gave it 5 stars because it is a book that cannot be left unread if you ever wish to argue for or against evolution, or just follow these debates. I read it at the rate of  about five pages an hour and wrote copious notes. After reading this book, I came to the conclusion that Darwin's theory was almost certainly incorrect.  Don't get me wrong, I believe life evolves, I just have a hard time believing it happens the way Darwin proposes. After reading this book, I read The Decent of Man. This really shook my belief in Darwinism. I recommend that these two books to everyone who calls themselves informed, just wants to be informed about this subject. Also, I recommend they read them in the order they were written.  Origin of Species was written almost a decade before Decent of Man.  I especially urge the reader to study section three of Decent of Man - this is perhaps the most glaring  example of the competence Darwin's science, I am willing to bet that if more people read this section, Darwin's influence in public education would decrease markedly.
B000V6ADNW|5.0|This album was 50 at his best. From top to bottom, it's flawless and definitely should be considered a classic.

This Heirloom Collection is formatted perfectly and the table of contents works great! If you are looking for a good complete collection of Sherlock Holmes this would be a great one to choose!
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Having seen the first one years ago I was not sure what to expect out of this one.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting, while not top notch, was fairly decent.  The plot was similar to the original, but enough was changed so I did not feel like I was watching the same movie.  The dancing was fun to watch and had me smiling at parts.  I must admit I even watched the ending scene twice.  In my opinion, the best character in the movie was Willard.  He made me laugh because he represents every person who is shy of dancing.  Overall it is worth watching.  Don't listen to all the people who hate it because it is a remake, some people will never be happy with a movie they feel trounces on the hallowed ground of a favorite movie of their youth.  Watch it, enjoy it and you might find yourself dancing after you finish it.

1908538694|4.0|This review Does Not address the worth of Hitler's book. But it is necessary to read it to understand what happened in World War II.<br /><br />This is the James Murphy translation of the First edition of Mein Kampf. It says it was the &#34;Official 1939 Edition&#34; and the &#34;only version officially sanctioned by the Nazi Foreign Office&#34;, but this is incorrect as NO version was sanctioned. There were authorized Abridged versions, but not a full translation. The Propaganda Ministry had ordered Murphy to make a full translation in 1936, but changed their mind six months later. The Hutchinson company (Hurst & Blackett in 1939) slipped it in under a technicality and got away with it. Reynal & Hitchcock also released an uabridged version in 1939 (which can be found in used bookstores occassionally) and Houghton Mifflin put one out (Manheim&#34;s) in 1943. The R & H version was allowed to go out of print in 1942 in favor of the 1943 Manheim translation.<br /><br />Murphy used the first edition and is, as far as I know, the only English translation to do so. The most common version available now is Ralph Manheim's (an excellent translation) that relied on later copies, so the texts are slightly different. Murphy's translation is literal and good, but like all translations makes Hitler appear a much better writer than he was. This is particularly true with Murphy. This is not a criticism, but a statement of fact. Anyone who has suffered through Hitler's vulgar rambling German and so of his convoluted Bavarian phrases will realize how good the Murphy work is. Manheim tried to render some of the oddities of Hitler's style.<br /><br />James Murphy's edition could not be sold in the United States because of British-American marketing agreements, and the printing plates were destroyed by German bombs in World War II, so for a long time it was only available in used copies if you could find them (and could spend the money). I never could, so I was happy to see Coda Booksreprint it. The copy is clear and readable and the book appears to be well bound. If you are a history nut and have tried to collect all the trans lations in English, then this is a welcome addition. If you only want to read Mein Kampf (Good Luck! Almost nobody ever manages to fight their way through the whole mess!) then I would suggest Ralph Manheim's easily aquired version.

B004SBX112|5.0|love the game and the concept, like that you can play holiday games or seasons, some are very hard some are fun and easy
0982954352|5.0|This book is a Christmas classic - obviously. This makes a great read by the fire this time of year.
B004GVUPFE|2.0|too hard to play with the invisible blocks that come up, love the game tetrus thought it was similar but its not haven't played much since I got it.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|Scratches the surfaces of a lot of topics, has some useful information. You can't really fault Ferriss for not going too in  depth on whatever he is talking about, whether it is cooking or learning Japanese; his advice is to focus on mastery of 20% of whatever you are learning as an effort appear competent in that task/topic. I think that is good advice if you are aiming to impress others in a multitude of contexts.
B005LAII08|5.0|IT was GREAT!!! I loved it!! It also had wonder 3D effects, it was a perfect movie for the family
B008MA2698|3.0|The one thing I did not like was the fact that you could only use the 4 pair of glasses that came with it to see the 3D, you could not use your original 3D glasses that came with the TV like you can for other movies. I ended up buying another DVD that I was able to use the other glasses.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This guy is so talented! I have never been disappointed in any of his songs. I can't wait for the next album.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The thing to remember is that this a soundtrack to a movie, not the theatrical version. The voices are good but not as full or operatic as the original, Broadway version. Also, the orchestral score is not as full. However, these trade offs are understandable because in a movie, you have a lot of visual distractions to the music. The album has all the songs without the talking in between scenes.
1449415881|5.0|Great product. I have used it for the last five years. It's a great way to start your day. Thanks
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Good solid adventure.  Puzzles were fun.  Liked the storyline involving Tesla.  Played on my Kindle Fire and had no problems.  Worth the price.
B005VTGB0S|1.0|I use Amazon for nearly all of my shopping and am pleased with most of your products. This leather folio cover was not the case. The first day I received it, the leather material on the cover started to separate from the layer below it, creating bubbles on the surface. Not a chance I will return it because although I have been your customer for 15 years I have only returned 4 items. The last was a iPhone juice pack. It was obvious  I had mistakenly ordered the  item twice. However could not get around to returning one of them for several months. It had not even been taken out of the box but the guy gave me a rough time and docked $30.00 from the price I paid. Shame-shame. Just look at my record.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|it seems to work ok although it does not have the same appearance of the desktop version you see online.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Beyond the most recent 8-10 posts you just see a blue activity log showing you other people have posted, but you can't see those posts. Pretty lame, especially if you haven't been on facebook in a while and were hoping to get caught up.
B006UKC566|4.0|For action and adventure this movie has some great scenes and it will keep you glued to the screen! recommended.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie has become one of my favorites!  My family watches it every year at Christmas.  It puts us in the Christmas spirit and keeps us laughing throughout the story.  The story is one that emits all the feelings that Jesus came to earth to bring....love, joy, peace, and a relationship with mankind.  This is a must have in your library of favorites for Christmas time!  We like it so much, this year we ordered the blu-ray version!  Merry Christmas!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce Willis is fantastic--very good DVD, Bruce Willis is my favorite actor--very action packed and worth seeing a couple more times a year.
B0091VTNZC|5.0|Instant Classic- silly Christmas tale of a human raised by elves who finds his real father and brings Christmas joy to NYC.  And saves Christmas of course. Honestly I know of only 1 person (she may be lacking a soul) that doesn't love this movie. Of course there will be non believers but I'm hard pressed to think of a movie more universally loved.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|sons of anarchy is the best show ever, thank you so much for having the seasons as me and my husband watch this show all the time and reruns
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Went against my normal policy here and wanted to see the movie before I read the book. That of course would be pure sacrilege so I bought the book kindle style an read it te day before I saw the film. Quick easy read and a great story. Which story do you think is the real one?? Btw the movie is also excellent. Visually pleasing and well done. See it in 3d
0143118757|4.0|Good read on basics of negotiation!! Read it and follow it for great results. I would infact read this book more than once
B00009AOBI|5.0|Mask was one of my fav movies as a child I can't wait to watch it again with my kids
020530902X|4.0|Even though this book is only 85 pages, it packs a punch. This is not a modern book, but more classical in it's teaching and message. It is simple, but profound. The book focuses on form and composition. It quickly and succinctly shows the reader what is appropriate writing style within the parameters of the English language. Chapters include, \\"Do not join independent clauses with a comma,\\" and fun statements like, \\"Avoid fancy words.\\" This book has been in my purse to read and re-read. For some reason we all know proper English (or think we know) but need to be reminded. This book was recommended by a fellow writer while we were talking about good reference books for writers. I believe this book is timeless, and a wise purchase.
0143034901|5.0|absorbing, well written, page turner<br />just visited Barcelona - may familiar sites<br />well developed characters and engaging story line<br />enjoy!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this for my grandchildren as a Christmas present. When we rented the movie they watched it on repeat!!!
B004M3GDI4|5.0|FANTASTIC. The light performs incredibly well. It does everything it said it would do very well. I would highly recommend.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|The game was neat but trying to land the plane with a tablet is really hard. My kids thought it was neat but lost interest quick. I am a console player and really enjoy a joystick. The game graphics are really great and for someone used to playing a tablet then this will probably be a great game. It just isn't my cup of tea.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Arrived in pristine condition, no problems here.<br />Kids watch it over and over. A little corny but entertaining.<br />Was on the wish list.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Kindle cables are unique and I liked the ability to use my apple power adapter interchangeably to charge the kindle.
0385342063|4.0|I listened to the book on cd and was delighted with it, not so much because the story was cute (it is unbelievable) but because the narration is absolutely charming (at least for this American).
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I bought the Eric Church albums backwards, starting with chief, then Carolina, then finally sinners.  I love the songs on sinners, lightening is such a beautiful song, they are all great (with possible exception of two pink lines, just because radio played it to death back when)
B0085A9J18|5.0|This is one of those movies where you read breathless reviews talking about how amazing the action scenes are and you think, \\"Yeah they couldn't live up to that hype.\\" But the scenes in The Raid totally do. There is a lot of gun violence in the first half but once the hand-to-hand combat kicks off it never lets up. There are some incredibly intricate and lengthy fight scenes, particularly the final showdown where it's two against one. The fighting is a perfect mix between carefully choreographed and clearly trained moves and wild-eyed, fight to survive pummeling, which makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen. Some other reviewers have said there's not much plot but I thought the brother vs. brother storyline as well as the crooked police lieutenant were solid enough plotlines for a movie that's entirely about the action sequences. This 100 minutes flies by!
B009GESJH2|3.0|I love kid rock, have seen him in concert 4 times. His last two albums have made it tough for me to defend him.  The album before this at least had a couple good, catchy tunes that were unique to kid rock, some duets with zbb etc.  this doesn't really have that one good song that makes up for the others.  I hope his next album steps up his game a bit.  I don't mind the softer, country side of kid rock, but he needs some better song choices.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Every version available, some you can listen to. Great reading plans and very customizable. You even earn badges for reaching milestones. Great app!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|this game is verry fun...it deffinately makes you think. I love it it also seems like you are in the game and that makes it seem more adventorous
B008M721MS|4.0|No review as of yet just trying to get started. I'm not good at computer gadgets, but so far i love it because it has everything I need at the palm of my hands!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless<br /><br />Sky Davis has led a sheltered life. Her adoptive mother Karen doesn't like technology so<br />there has been no television, no phone, no internet, nothing. Sky was homeschooled<br />and it wasn't until her senior year of high school that her mother agreed to let her attend<br />a public school.  That's when her life changes and she questions her entire existence.<br /><br />Dean Holder has just returned to town after being away for a year and when he sees Sky<br />for the first time he thinks he knows her.  He is drawn to her and quickly discovers why.<br /><br />What an emotional read, not only has \\"Holder\\" had to live with the pain of loss but Sky<br />questions the last 13 years of her life.<br /><br />The story line is so real and heartbreaking I couldn't stop reading, I needed to<br />know what the outcome would be and hope it wouldn't be \\"hopeless\\" for Holder and Sky.<br />Wow, sums it up!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I was looking for a cheep flash that could fill my needs and this one fit that bill to a tee...
B000YDG5W0|5.0|1st the price can't be beaten for such a comfortable boot which looks awesome with jeans.  Super light and warm for my use.  these are my 1st pair of timberlands and I am very glad I decided to go with these- zero regret with my purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is even better than when I played it on my friends ipad! I just love it. and I really thought that it would cost money but its free!!!
B001OQCV2O|3.0|I literally waited 3 years to watch this movie on this date. Well, the Mayans were wrong and can't do anything right. Everyone worried for no reason at all. Anyway, on to the review. The movie was pretty good. Very entertaining. John Cusack stars as a sci-fi writer named Jackson Curtis (50 Cent's name backwards) Somehow, this guy can survive every explosion, volcano, earthquake, tidal wave and everything else the apocalypse has to offer as he tries to get his family to safety. If you like Michael explosions, you'll like 2012!!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is a fun movie that definitely kept me entertained.  The singing was great, and I can definitely see myself watching it again.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I read this every year. Dicken's classic Christmas tale never seems to grow old, and it always leaves me ready to enjoy the holiday season with a new feeling of appreciation for this wonderful author.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is the panacea for all the gloom & doom, apocalypse is imminent books out there. This novel makes you feel like everything is going to be okay, that it's human relationships that make the difference in life, that our interconnectedness is the key to immortality.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Good purchase. Something on the inside was a little sticky, but the DVDs function properly and was in overall good condition, just a few ruff dents on the box.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Use it in your backpacking/camping gear bag for those times to sharpen a blade at the camp site or tools around the house.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie put huge smiles on the faces of all three of my kids. The price put a huge smile on my face. Love this movie...
1595822003|5.0|Oh, Bernie Wrightson, great God illustrator of classic Gothic Horror. Where can you go wrong with Bernie Wrightson?  Back in 1983, out of sheer love of Mary Shelley's classic novel, Frankenstein, comic illustrator Bernie Wrightson made a fully illustrated edition of the classic novel (currently available on amazon). The illustrations are nearly exactly what Mary Shelley described save for a strange liberty in making the creature's nose look like the nose of a skeleton.  This was not described in the original novel and I was never quite sure of the point behind it.  Oh, well.  Bernie did the job for free.  A nice, hard cover reprint of this book with an introduction by horror icon, Stephen King is currently available on Amazon for less than thirty dollars.<br /><br />  Bernie Wrightson was the illustrator for comic books for many years and even did the artwork for a Color the monster book back in the seventies.  I used to have the color the monster book actually signed by Bernie. I bought it in Upstate New York.  Now it has disappeared on me, probably accidentally thrown away by someone who did not realize what it was.  He also did the art work for Stephen King's Cycle of the werewolf (made into the movie Silver Bullet) and Creepshow (also made into a movie).<br /><br /> The artwork here is beautiful and atmospheric and has a classic Gothic quality to it that you may only know from certain very old comic books.  As I said before, the onlyd etail I'm not fond of is how he doe the nose of the creature. That was not how it was described in the novel. Otherwise this is perfect.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|My first review, because I want to honor this book in some way and after reading dozens of eKindle sci-fi I can't think of a better one to start with!  A nail-biting, laugh-till-you-cry but afraid to turn the page story about an astronaut who could be your next door neighbor stuck on Mars after a violent sandstorm separates him from his team.  The author deftly balances action on Mars, Earth, and the capsule returning from Mars with the rest of his team and you can't wait for each thread to be revisited.  Amazingly realistic, the author brings \\"down to earth\\" what it takes to continue surviving on the Red planet with what the rest of his team left behind for the next team.  A better .99 could not be spent!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I played it on the airplane on my way to Mexico and at the beach when i was there too.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|This totally exceeded all expectations ! The colors are so bright they almost hurt my eyes. The 3D made me feel as if I was part of this fantasy world... Excellent value for money !
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Has great different levels to play:-)  recommend it highly:-)  different levels different puzzles to play easy directions if not familar with game
B008NB0SQO|4.0|The Muppets are always a fun and colorful bunch with a good sense of humour. This blu-ray disc is a welcome replacement for my old DVD. The Muppets have found a loving home at Disney so they now get quality re-releases on blu-ray disc that are Disney-worthy.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I was able to catch Peter in Mesa, Arizona with two dear friends and acquired a multi-cd set of that nights show from the people who ran his tour for a nominal amount.<br /><br />This show was a little bit more &#34;raw&#34; than the one I was at, but equally amazing. I wish there were more shots of all the things that were shown on the screens behind the band, i.e.,shots of all stages of Peter's career and pictures of his musical idols and friends. The sound of the Bluray and camera work are 1st rate. I recommend you listen and watch on high quality audio and video gear.<br /><br />The part of the show that I enjoyed the most was, believe it or not, the part after FCA is over and he does a mish mash of his Humble Pie & solo material as well as a spine-tingling version of Soundgarden's &#34;Black Hole Sun&#34;.<br /><br />I wanna  go to the sun...
B0084TWN9K|5.0|One of Canada's best storytellers has outdone herself once again. This collection is beautifully written, poignant and moving. A true journey through life - and death.
B005E2PQTE|1.0|Unless your BluRay player was manufactured in the UK or maybe Europe also, don't but this title. You won't have a picture to watch.
B000V7J82S|5.0|amazing product, i go to eep listening to the songs everynight. and it got to my house on the first day it was expected.
0307341550|4.0|I burnt too many kettles so got one with auto switch off. My parents used to own a Russell Hobbs electric kettle years ago so I got the same one for myself and one for my daughter.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I can't believe how overrated this book is!  The first part was ok but it quickly became almost laughable- the story line was so lame. I didn't really care to even finish it. I am so glad I didn't pay for this book.
030758836X|4.0|getting  into twisted psyche's makes for scary reading.It was an easy read- hard to put down once started .have not read her other books yet.
1451695195|4.0|It certainly is an interesting book from the point of view of the remarkable experience of a man of science<br />and former doubter of anything spiritual after death.  The format used, however,<br />seemed to me not the best, diminishing somewhat the essence of the story.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Well the product seemed nice, but with the 2nd fan attached it just would not work with my computer setup. Would interfer in two of my memory slots. So i wen't with a different cooler.  Thanks Pitbullman
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie. Great price - this was delivered when our elf arrived from the north pole. The kids watched it at home and school.
B008US25E8|5.0|This CD brings back memories for those of us who grew up listening to Aerosmith!  True to form!  Lots of new songs-same old style!  Luv it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best app ever on the kindle.  its worth 7 bucks. so glad it came out on the kindle fire.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this to navigate on my kindle fires, as it shows folders that I make, where the kindle fire system does not.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I chose this rating because it has some cosmetic wear but other than that it was in great condition. It is a present for my husband and I'm sure he'll love it.
B004QWKIYQ|5.0|DOO-WAPS & HOOLIGANS:  Gotta love that Bruno Mars.  Bruno is a gifted musician. Highly recommend this CD--even though I don't know what a Doo-Wap is!  Many thx.
B008220AVW|5.0|This movie was for my daughter and we receive it very quickly and in good order. She loves it cause she is number 1 fan and she enjoyed a lot because it resume the life of Katy and her concerts .
B008HK3RVY|5.0|I checked out several cases for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; before settling on this one. My Kindle fits snug and the Velcro flap keeps it secure. The sleeve has enough padding to protect the Kindle without being bulky. The color kind of grows on you after a while. I'd but it again.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|My mom bought this for me and i rated this &#34;I Love it&#34; because this is a pretty good Album because it have all my favorite songs from Katy and i liked sooo muchh!!... And Yess i would like to recommend this product to all Katy Fans out there.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie is just another bad remake of a good movie. The special effects and set design are subpar (just like most movies made in todays tight economic times). Rent the original instead, you won't regret it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a first major novel for this author. I was greatly surprised by the structure of the plot - I found the past and the present experiences of the main characters drew me into the story. I found parts of the story deeply moving and by the end wanted to keep reading into a hopeful and happy future I could visualise. It was raw, real and connected to the histories of many people who have experienced the harshness of being orphaned.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice and conveinient app and its. free. great great great great great great great great great and awesome app app
B007V508CC|5.0|i love every song on the CD. Well worth the investment into this CD. I would and will definitely recommend it
B008133DO8|5.0|I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan and this undoubtedly one of the greatest adaptation of the novels in many years. It maintains your interest throughput the entire program. The show has its humorous moments along with just enough drama that feels believable. My only complaint is that I cannot wait for more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King has long been one of my favorite authors. His characters are always engaging and his stories compelling. In 11/22/63 we find ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, people just like friends and family. In addition to the usual paradoxes of time travel, this book poses ethical and moral dilemmas, while taking the reader on a breathtaking tour of the country in the 60s. It explores the social climate of the time, good and bad. Frequent readers will enjoy the references to other King novels.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|My wife rented and watched this. She said it was the worst movie she had seen in years. She even said that his acting was so bad that \\"I've lost respect for Matthew McConaughey\\". Her words not mine.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|When i started playing i completely lost track of time. It is very fun, simple and challenging. I would definitely recommend purchasing Osmos :)
B00932ANQM|4.0|Your standard chick flick but worth watching considering all the half baked movies being produced these days. I wanted to be Zac Efron by the end of the movie. I used to consider chick flick to be a bad term but with the crappy action and scifi movies these days, these give us something entertaining to watch.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it. When I noticed that it was so inexpensive to buy, I just had to have it. If you like Nicolas Cage and action, then you must own it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very can't even imagine meeting someone like that. Teaches us how to guard the things we say and mean it
B004ZNAXX2|4.0|If you love Pink Floyd, then you must own this box set. It comes with great versions of the wall songs and some added bonus music and toys.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Enticing, intriguing, captivating, heartbreaking... probably the most amazing book I have ever read. I definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I've seen the movie several times and I still love watching it! Great visuals! The way in which it is filmed is second to none...
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Pi tells his remarkable tale of survival while easing the memory of a great loss.  The reader is drawn into the story through skilled writing.
B009CPES4I|3.0|A decent, but very bland movie.  Only rent if nothing else catches your eye.  Nothing objectional, but nothing exciting at all
B009ZE27US|5.0|its funny how they think your 39 when your 2 and 21 when your 9 my little sister is 2 and she got 59 so funny that's why it's funny here's the bad part IT SHUTS MY KINDLE FIRE DOWN DONT GET THIS APP IT TAKES 5 OR 4DAYS TO GET IT BACK IF YOU GET THIS APP YOUR GOING TO BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie and when it was over I thought it was just ok and wouldn't really recommend it to family and friends.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My four-year-old granddaughter loves this game!  It is repetitious, but she is adorable when she is talking to my Kindle Fire and telling the &#34;patients&#34; everything will be fine!  She also chides them for throwing trash on the floor, which she picks up.  I have seen my 8-year-old granddaughter playing the game as well, she is a huge animal lover, but it doesn't hold her interest nearly as long as the 4-year-old.  She will, however, load up her little sister's hospital with patients and then walk away!  The little one just chats and taps - over and over until the hospital is clear.  Very cute game, it does help with computer skills in that there are several &#34;cures&#34; that require manipulation of objects on the screen.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan captured my respect and admiration when she beautifully sang her way into our hearts on Britain's Got Talent in 2009.  She only gets better! Each time an album comes out I am already hoping for the next one! Her versions of the standard classics on this album stand the test of time and repeated listenings.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Very cute movie, I don't regret taking the time to watch it, but I wouldn't watch it twice.  It is primarily about several different couples getting through the pregnancy experience.  I found it to be truthful, heartbreaking in a few scenes, and amusing most of the time.  The deliveries will have you laughing on the floor if you have ever had a baby - not so much if you haven't.  Worth the rental, I won't be purchasing it.
B004UJN1XA|5.0|Has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. So absolutely well written, acted and directed that all of that hilarity actually turns into very poignant messages in the end. A great one to watch if you've had a bad or sad day!!
B009FB3W9G|5.0|It was worth the cost even though it doesn't show the tribute only the singers who sing songs associated with Barbra. Lea Michele, Faith Hill and Bill Maher (who was the only celebrity that spoke) was worth the money. I also noticed one man who I didn't recognize (and I'm in the entertainment field) was close captioned often and I never seen him before. Lack of Streisand being the focus also annoyed me, but I love Barbra and would pay to hear her read the alphabet.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|This thing is awesome. Personally I can't stand intel, and intel is so incredibly expensive! AMD is what I have used for the past 7-8 years and right now I don't see myself changing to anything else! Thing is awesome!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It was funny, but not the funniest movie ever. Love fat Amy. Some good one liners. I'd watch it again.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|it takes for ev er to load<br />its a good game but it takes forever<br />I like how the shark eats the people
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Because of our unfortunate but understandable obsession with the unthinkable, post 9/11, this resonates in a way that is too close for comfort....and yet...to dare to be uncomfortable is a compulsion of its own.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Probably shouldn't laugh at some of the jokes--but you will. Funny stuff. Good way to pass a Saturday evening at home.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|Liked the Movie but the bad language was not necessary but of course I'm from the generation that didn't have to use that kind of language to enjoy a good movie or any life in general.  Too bad times have changed.  No wonder the youth of America don't know if their up or down.  The examples they have to follow are terrible!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It had a star studded cast- Weisz, Norton, Renner, and that scary looking asian guy- oh la la! Yet it didn't deliver. It's what someone said, this movie only needed a good director. Too bad. I really like Jeremy.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|All good Floyd great elo is an undiscovered diamond willburys a little slower then I thought.overall very satisfied and happy
B009439HEY|5.0|Thank you Steve Hackett and friends for keeping early Genesis music alive. A must have compilation for early Genesis fans.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great processor very quick, works well with ASUS P8 z77- v LK. Very easy to install and setup the bios.
B001ADQXHA|5.0|Just rediscovered Meat Loaf. Takes me back to my youth:-)<br /><br />Powerful vocals with outstanding musical arrangements. What can I say? It's Meat Loaf, buy it!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|delivered in a timely manner. was in condition as advetised.  delivered in secure package.  Would buy again from this seller.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|We struggled through what we hoped would be a lovely Christmas movie, but threw this one in the trash.  I couldn't understand what this story, or mix of stories had to do with love. I realize I'm old-fashioned, but I am so disappointed that anyone would believe the ideas presented here are healthy, happy concepts of real love.  I'm so weary of films with gratuitous, meaningless sex and meaningless stories. We never looked at the rating beforehand, since this was presented as a Christmas movie.  An R-rated Christmas movie? If you want a warm Christmas movie, try the old black and white stories; you will be more likely to find a little more real warmth and love, and maybe a bit of real Christmas.

B004LWZW7O|4.0|Overall, a great movie! The story line is different and the characters are good. I'm an action fanatic and this was fast enough to keep me interested and excited. I recommend anyone who's looking for a great action movie with a bit of a different story than the normal hero plot to give this a try.
086571701X|4.0|I bought this for my husband because he's interested in this sort of thing.  So he read it just to satisfy his curiosity.  He enjoyed reading it, but some of the examples require a large investment and he just wanted to know how things worked.<br /><br />So, yes, it fulfilled the purpose for which I bought it.  Yes, it's complete in its coverage.<br /><br />I recommend reading it even if you aren't going to follow through and do the gardening.
B002VWNID6|1.0|Not even half of the movie was on the DVD. When I was watching the movie, the disc suddenly stopped and jumped to the main menu. When I looked at the scene selection page, not all the movie chapters were available.
B005V20JKI|4.0|I just got it and it is blast and I have fun playing it it is one of the best apps
B004M5HUXE|4.0|It certainly kept me guessing. It was very risque for it's day. It was feminism before it's time. Very strong women discovering their sexuality.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was drawned to this book.  However, it is a little repetitive but I enjoyed the story line.  Read for yourself and don't trust all the bad reviews!
034580404X|5.0|Big fan of the books! Enjoyed getting lost for hours in the story line! Author does a great job of drawing you in to the plot of the books. Recommended this book to all the my lady friends & even a few guys!! ;)
1451638450|5.0|OK, so it is mainly space opera, so what!  Anything by Lois McMaster Bujold is so well written that I gobble it up like chocolate!

B00005V9IK|5.0|It took a little time to get to me but otherwise very pleased. Very happy that it was in great condition.  Great sci-fi action film. Will smith is great and the aliens are gross. Thank you do much, will order from you again.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|It's a great product , even at more surrounding noise the mic does the job pretty well. Must mic for the Vloggers.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|My DVD came very quickly just before the holidays. Was in good condition and packaged so well. I love this movie and now I have on DVD . Thank you so much.
0316067601|5.0|I really thought this was a great book,very tragic but also inspirational.Marcus Luttrell has lived thru what most of us never will experience in our safe and boring lives where we look up to overpaid movie stars and singers to inspire us.In my opinion he is the real deal and deserves every accolade he gets.The man is an inspiration who put everything on the line to serve his country.Read this book to see what real brave men are all about,and not a Hollywood star in sight!
B009OA57MI|3.0|I loved the free version but now I'm trying to download the full version and there's an error.... Is this costing me 2 bucks? Will I get my full version?<br /><br />...to be continued
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I  bought this set for my 8yr old son who loves it when waiting for dinner at a resturaunt or anywhere we play is really fun!
B006QQCCOY|4.0|But for some reason I just couldn't hate the guy in the movie.  If the girl would have been a little more convincing actress I would 5 star it.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Pretty good action movie.  Keeps you watching, with the action throughout.  Acting pretty good too.  It's actually a 3 1/2 star movies, but no ability to mark it that.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love it works well with my kindle fire .it's really good and it is a freeby ell you can't beat that I really like amazon as well
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Wasn't great, but not too bad. Definitely worth watching.  I give it three stars, but really it is a 3 1/2 star movine.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Whitney  what a voice.Very good cd.You should buy it if you love Whitney. When ever i think about her and the loss of her voice.I put it on and cry.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|I've seen this movie in theaters, long ago when it was released. And had forgoten the grace a subtlety that surrounds the charactetrs.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|Who doesn't know Barbra. I think she is one of our best singers still going strong.The fact that she came back to Brooklyn and new her roots.This is great and I'm not disappointed at all.
B005GHN2GG|3.0|I really like fantasy books, but this one was a bit of a stretch even for me. Master of Crows was a little harder to get into than most other books in its genre. I enjoy a small bit of romance in most plots, but I found this book a little heavy on the &#34;heaving,&#34; this and &#34;throbbing&#34; that. There's a lot of redundancy with the almost-but-not-quite-sexual tension that the author could've done without. Overall, I felt the use of sex in the book was excessive. The book is interesting enough to start and finish, but plot-centric.. and even if you're looking for a plot-driven read, this still isn't it... I think if you're the kind of reader that liked the Chronicles of the Warlands series by Elizabeth Vaughan, then this book will probably be right up your alley. Otherwise it's just another &#34;C-&#34; read in the fantasy world.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was great I loved it.  It's a very emotional book it really tugged at my heart you cant help but fall on love with Hazel Grace and Augustus.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is a blast. I played this game for 2 HOURS and I still wanted to play but the kindle ran out of batterys  :(. I was super sad so sad that I wanted to buy another kindle and download the game.  My favorite character was the black girl I made her look like Taylor swift.There are really cool hair styles that u can do.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Totally gripping - as if am living in the time frame (WW 11).  So much fear, hope and passion expressed.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I don't play but the kids do and they love it. So that's what matters to me cuz im not really into the games.
B005HSL626|2.0|My youngest daughter loves playing this game (even though she tends to slice bombs more often than fruit), however I end up having to force close nine times out of ten! It's constantly freezing or telling me it needs to close, sometimes as soon as the game starts up! Maybe it just needs an update, but I'm very disappointed at this point.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I loved this book. The plot was fascinating, it moved quickly, I loved the characters and particularly the dilemmas they faced. The book worked very well and left me with much to think about.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it`s a great game to play for all ages and for all sex groups. any person who is thinking about this game get it
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I really enjoy Alice Munro's writing. I had read at least two of these stories elsewhere. She brings you right into<br />the life's of her characters.
9626340959|5.0|This is a lovely version of, &#34;Emma&#34;, by Jane Austen. However, I discovered it was one of my least favorites by her, so I now have &#34;read&#34; it via audio book and can now say I don't need to buy the hard back version. Thank you for your great service.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a typical Vince Flynn novel with constant action.  The plot is intricate and Mitch Rapp never lets you down!!
B002APU580|4.0|This movie so closely followed the novel that I enjoyed re-reading the novel.  Also enjoyed the natural and more historically accurate scenes -- the laundry, the servants, the dining scenes and the simplicity of the clothes.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. Pictures are great on the fire and the story was well written. A sweet and strange story about the \\"peculiar people\\"<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|After enjoying the 4 hour Workweek and loving the 4 hour Body, I was anxious to get my hands on this book. My pre-order arrived punctually and I was thrilled to dive in. The intro had me hooked and I'm skipping though and trying things like vinegar balls and herb tasting. I'm just about ready to try my first dish, thanks Tim.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love this book I couldn't even put it down I would stay up all night just to finish it
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I have it plugged in and it transmits the signal as it should.  Nothing to complain about on this one.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It was as good as, if not better than, The Expendables.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that Arnold and Bruce saved the day and they are not part of the team.  In effect, the directors put them in debt to these characters.  Plus, why didn't they take the other sea plane that was just sitting there next to the rattle trap they were given?  I also missed Jet Li.
B008JAG2AA|3.0|not like the original. Allison Hanigan cannot act her way out of a paper bag. Lacked the humor of the earlier movies. Cannot imagine ever watching this one a second time.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Originally I didn't see The Dark Knight Rises at the theater because of the length. However it was good to watch from home (Amazon on-demand) so we could spread out over 2 nights. Very well made and excellent ending but it could have been a bit more condensed in the first half.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|best game ive ever played if you buy this game you will have absolutely no regrets and if it says error you probly don't have enough space on your kindle
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I am a fan of the music of composer, Ennio Morricone.<br />Add in the talent of Yo Yo Ma with gorgeous arrangements and I find myself listening to this CD over and over again.<br />I do not tire of it at all.
B007IUBU86|5.0|I like Mike Portnoy and that's how i found out about the band.<br />Good album. Hope they'll come up with more
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I hesitated on this for a while, because of average reviews. Boy was I stupid. This is a masterpiece of a musical, and anyone that truly appreciates good musical Theatre will love this. Maybe some Johnny-come-lately bandwagon fans of Phantom that don't appreciate or understand musicals will complain, but it is truly magical. Yes the actors sing most of the dialog, it's supposed to be like that, duh! It emphasizes the few times that they don't, and continues in the same vein as PTO, and other classic musicals.<br /><br />I never heard the score from 2 years ago, I just saw the finished version on this Blu-ray. It has been a long time since I have sat down and had my breath taken away while watching a show like this. A Great score, fantastic performances, and visually stunning as well. You'll never believe that these extraordinary sets and smooth scene changes could fit onto one stage. As a technician, I've watched it a few times and am still amazed. Whatever bugs there were in the earlier works (2010 recordings)have all been worked out and perfected in this Blu-ray. I really hope this version comes to the US. I can't wait to see it live. Please, don't be a sheep and decide based on someone else's like or dislike of it. You owe it to yourself to watch it and decide. For a few more years I will dream of playing the part of the Phantom! Thank you Mr. Webber! :)
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My husband is very interested in World Wat II.  I bought him this set as a gift and he absolutely loves it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. it is very entertaining and fun to play when you may bored. I love that its challenging and makes you think.
B009186JYI|4.0|While this does not really come off as a full narrative, and certainly doesn't have the well crafted quality of A Hard Day's Night, Charlie is my Darling is a fascinating look inside the life of the Stones in the early 60's.  I can't believe we watch Mick and Keith song writing, and hear them sing covers of Beatles tunes, and a rousing Londoner anthem!  They also seem to be having such a wonderful time - it's a pleasure to see.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A definite Grisham classic with a myriad of twists and turns throughout; it will keep you guessing. A good read.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|LZ pull this off magnificently.  Bonham, Jr, does great work.  Makes one wish they'd tour (although not if they'd charge the kind of anti-middle class prices the Stones were able to get the rich to cough up)!  Finally, also, a film that spends some time focusing on the fabulously talented John Paul Jones.  All in all, this is a must-see for any serious Led Zep fan.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|will i love the one song they do called, hold on, and was hoping they`d have one or two more but was disappointed when i heard their album, sorry i waisted my money, but i do like the one song
B008GFI418|4.0|I have always thought George Martin was a genius, and was undeniably the &#34;fifth Beatle.&#34;  There really would have been no Beatles as we know them if it hadn't been for the masterwork production of George Martin.  This documentary gives us more insight into who he was and how he did it.  Very cool!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Until I read this book, I was unaware what a massive labor/slave state North Korea is.  This story both amazed and saddened me.  Shin is a great hero to me now.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is informative, thought provoking, and evocative.  At first it is difficult to understand the leaps the author takes from one incident to another, but that's the way emotions work.  They come to us when we least expect them.  The use of flowers as an alternate form of expression is engaging.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great story line and characters. Very effective at relating to real life situations. Easy to follow!<br />I would recommend to all my friends!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This had good reviews and I liked the price being free.  However when I got into it I discovered you have to buy the coins in order to play.  No thanks it was deleted just as free.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Got it in time...great movie. Had my order gift wrapped aswell and it came looking pretty good. No problems here
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! Exciting and kept me guessing. Love the twist at the end and can't wait to see what awaits in book three.
0894803123|5.0|This book had a whole slew of great recipes. They were easy to follow and fun to make. Recommend it.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I heard this album by accident on a plane. I noticed it because of the pun from the 1930's Mississippi Sheiks. I loved this album from the first time listening. Wonderful dramatic yet down-to-earth vocals. Smart, sharp songs of love and loss - mostly loss. Strikingly sophisticated music. These songs hit you in the heart and they stay with you.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's been years in the making.  Something so big, so ambitious, fanboys across the world couldn't help but geek out at the mere thought of it.  Five individual films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America), all with intersecting story lines, lead to this mega event.  Six superheros in one movie.  This is, The Avengers.  Let's go.<br /><br />What I liked about the film:<br />Our Heroes<br /><br />One of the problems with superhero films that flop is, there are too many characters, and not all of those characters get a their fair share of material.  That is not the case in The Avengers.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, a mysterious man with his own agenda and ways of doing things.  Jackson gets to shine by keeping the audience guessing.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man.  And of course, he is given the best dialogue in the film.  Downey exudes wit and charm in the character we have all come to know and love.  Chris Evans delicately plays Steve Rodgers/Captain America.  He is the &#34;fish out of water&#34;, who's returned to America after being frozen for 70 years.  Evans stays true to his character's beginnings in the military and plays the hero with a sense of honor and respect.  The rest of the team is made up of Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye.  There are also great supporting characters played by Clark Gregg and Stellan Skarsgard.  The cast is wonderful and demand our attention on the screen.<br /><br />You thought I left out one of the heroes didn't you?  No way.  It took a few tries, but the Hulk is finally &#34;done right&#34; in this movie!  Mark Ruffalo plays a wonderful Bruce Banner.  He must have been the most difficult character for the film makers, in more ways than one, but it superbly done.  Ensemble films like this usually wait until the third act to give every character something to do, that is not the case here.  Every character is an important piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />The Conflict<br /><br />Our heroes are by no means perfect.  By bringing all these characters together, there was bound to be conflict.  Everything from egos to ideals, the movie portrays conflict among the gang perfectly.  Check out the forest scene, where three of our heroes go at it, awesome!<br /><br />The Special Effects<br /><br />Bar none, the best special effects of any superhero film ever made.  Marvel spared no expense.  The movie is a spectacle to be enjoyed by all.  What I find amazing is the animators had to recreate characters that other companies have already used in previous films; all while making us believe the continuity.  The third act is non-stop, amazing action.  The best part is, it is all to serve the story; it never gets repetitive or boring.<br /><br />Joss Whedon<br /><br />The script by Writer/Director Joss Whedon is phenomenal. His talent shines through every minute of the film.  He was literally the best man for the job.  Whedon has created, and directed, amazing sci fi movies and television shows.  He's written comic book stories as well.  His script gave every character a fair chance to shine.  His choice in almost every aspect of the movie is perfect.  The tone of the film is great, reminiscent of the Iron Man films.  The editing and pacing are spot on, never leaving a dull moment for the audience.  The character arcs are treated with care, to ensure we can relate to these super humans, and not just view them as Gods, with no humanity.  I can only hope he is hired back to direct the sequels.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film:<br />The Villain<br />Let me be clear.  I loved Tom Hiddleston in this movie, but I didn't fear the threat of world domination by his character.  Loki is of course the God of mischief, but come one.  These are the Avengers.  Loki was already taken down by his brother Thor once before; now you're talking about six superheroes.<br /><br />The Score<br />A memorablemovie needs a memorable score.  I remember sitting in the theater waiting for the explosion of music to come, and it never did.  Alan Silvestri is a two-time Oscar nominee, but he missed the target on this one in my opinion.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Simply Amazing<br /><br />That's the word, amazing.  Marvel President Kevin Feige had a vision that began in 2007, during the filming of the first Iron Man.  What if there was a scene at the end of the film credits, teasing an Avengers film?  After all the characters in the team returned in-house from other studios, it would become a reality.  I mentioned it in the title, and it is no over exaggeration...  The Avengers is the most ambitious film of all time.  To bring six characters, from five previous films together; and do it with the care and style that Whedon has done, is unbelievable.<br /><br />The latest news this morning is that the film has the biggest box office opening of all time.  $200 millions dollars.  That tops 2011's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 at approx. $169 million dollars, and 2008's The Dark Knight with approx. $158 million dollars.  After watching the film, it does not surprise me at all.  The film will appeal to young and old, male and female.  And THAT, is the sign of a great movie.  Congratulations to all the players in this amazing journey.v
B000002GL4|5.0|I don't actually have a review, just a comment. Why, on just about every list of best \\"Rock\\" LP's off all time is this recording always left off?<br />The Ultimate Classic Rock website left all Frampton songs off the list of best \\"rock\\" songs and this LP never makes any critic's list of Top 10, 20, 50, 100 LP's. Thankfully I don't listen to critic's. Last time I listened to Frampton he was in the category of Rock. I hate to categorize musicians but these days it seems a given. Was it the Sgt. Pepper movie or the \\"I'm in You\\" LP cover photo that erased him from the \\"Rock\\" list. This was, at one point the biggest selling \\"Rock\\" LP of all time. Back in the 70's every metal head had a copy of this record, right along side Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|It's already been two years?  Holy wow, I can't believe how time flies!  In 2009, The Hangover became the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time.  Rightfully so.  With a blend of unique characters, a funny premise, and shock value to boot; it was a homerun.  It catapulted Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis to stardom.  And it proved director Todd Phillips was a someone with longevity in this business.<br /><br />The first movie followed the three main characters as they tried to find their lost friend after a night they couldn't remember.  The movie took place in Las Vegas and the city was a great backdrop to the story being told.  This time around, the &#34;Wolfpack&#34; finds themselves in a similar situation, only this time, they've lost a friend in Bangkok, Thailand.  Oh no... The Hangover II.<br /><br />What I liked about the film:<br />The Wolfpack (including the monkey)<br /><br />This is an obvious one.  Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis have an unbelievable chemistry together.  The three actors feed and play off of each other so well, they're totally believable in their roles.<br /><br />Galifianakis steals most of the scenes again, as he did in the first film.  Helms plays the paranoid panic attack very well.  And the contrast to Helms is Bradley Cooper, who never seems to get phased by anything.  Ken Jeong and Paul Giamatti round out some great supporting characters as well.  And don't forget about the much talked about monkey.  Baby Carlos has NOTHING on the cigarette smoking, drug dealing monkey in the sequel.  It was cleverly worked into the film and actually served a purpose in the plot.  Great!<br /><br />The setting<br /><br />Vegas was a great place to setup the last film.  It just made sense for the guys to wake up in their hotel room, not remembering much.  This time, they pushed the envelope.  Thailand is so visually busy, the movie will need a second viewing to catch everything.  Tying in Jeong's character into the setting was great.  Watching the movie, you got a real sense of how difficult it was for the cast and crew to work in such busy conditions.  I've read interviews with director, Phillips, where he says it was his most difficult shoot to date.<br /><br />The one-liners, memorable<br /><br />I hate when I go to a movie and leave not recalling a thing.  That wasn't the case with this film.  My wife and I left the theater repeating one-liner after the other.  I am well aware of all the criticisms of the film being identical to the first (I'll get to that in a minute), but the movie is very memorable and will hold up against a lot of other comedies out there.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film:<br />Sub-plot<br />I find myself disliking a lot of film sub-plots.  It's because it feels like the movie wouldn't have suffered if they took it out completely.  Without giving anything away, the sub-plot involves Jeong and Giamatti's characters.  The writers used it as a device to take the main characters from one place to the next, but once the sub-plot is revealed in full, there's no pay off.  I didn't like it and wished they would have written it out of the movie.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Loved it, KNOWING what I was walking into<br /><br />I think people just wanted to hate the film.  &#34;It's exactly like the first one.&#34;  &#34;They couldn't have thought of anything better?&#34;  Interesting how you weren't criticizing the movie while laughing so hard I couldn't hear the dialogue.  Look, the first trailer showed us all that it was going to have the EXACT same format as the first film.  So I knew what I was getting myself into and was very content with it.  To me, it was fresh and funny in ways the first one wasn't; and it was enough to satisfy my hunger for another grown-up comedy after Bridesmaids.  Check out The Hangover II, you will not be disappointed!at.  Watching the movie, you got a real sense of how difficult it was for the cast and crew to work in such busy conditions.

007174889X|3.0|The classic heavy and verbose textbook of internal medicine. With all of the information online, it makes you wonder if you will need to purchase a textbook once you are an experienced practitioner. Web links are helpful. May not be as up to date as web based medical sources.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Captain America is one of the most beloved Marvel Superheros ever. It's kind of sad that it took this long to get his own movie considering what he represents.  The character of Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans, is an interesting one.  He is small, puny and wants nothing more than to be a soldier in the U.S. Military.  When a doctor creates a serum to help him become physically superior soldier, that's when all the fun happens.  Let's go!<br /><br />What I liked about the movie:<br />The Cast<br /><br />The cast, both starring and supporting, were very impressive in this movie.  I didn't know how to feel about Chris Evans as Captain America.  I always thought he was a good actor for genre films, but didn't know if he could command attention as a superhero.  Rest assured, he's great!  In the first act, pre-serum injections, his acting ability really comes through.  The audience will feel sympathy for the kid from Brooklyn who wants nothing more than to serve his country.  Evans shows us that Steve Rogers was a good MAN, way before he was a good superhero.  Nicely Done!<br /><br />The supporting cast was very awesome!  Hugo Weaving as the main villain, Red Skull, was great.  Even the cheesy accent was ok with me.  Weaving has the voice, arrogance and presence needed to play the villain.  I enjoyed his work very much.  Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter was a delight on screen, not the usual damsel in distress.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a perfect Colonel in the Military, he is compassionate enough for us to care about him, but stern enough to lead in a war.  Stanley Tucci... is there anything Tucci can't do?!  He's awesome as the Doctor who invents the serum for Steve Rogers.  Sebastian Stan plays Bucky, Steve Rogers best friend, nicely done by the young actor.<br /><br />The Setting<br /><br />The movie mostly takes place during World War II.  The production design team does such an amazing job with the set pieces, the costumes, etc.  What's also impressive is the lighting, and camera work.  Shelly Johnson used just the right lighting that gave the movie an older feel without overdoing it.  It was nice to see a superhero film that wasn't in modern day times.<br /><br />The Story / Writing<br /><br />Simple, easy to follow and exciting.  Hugo Weaving's character believes in &#34;magic&#34; which was stolen from Odin's vault.  It is the Cosmic Cube which has been referenced in the Marvel Universe of films.  It has a great deal of power and, if harnessed correctly, could destroy every major city in the world.  Captain America and company must stop Red Skull from doing so.  The writing is clever and I never rolled my eyes at any horrible dialogue.  The writers were clever and even made fun of the Captain America suit before we could as an audience.  I love when writers acknowledge things like that without making it obvious!<br /><br />What I liked and didn't like about the film:<br />The Director<br /><br />Joe Johnston has done a lot of work in Hollywood.  He made a great name for himself with popular films like Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Jumanji, October Sky and Jurassic Park III.  I think he's a good storyteller, but there are aspects of his films that just don't click.  His movies always look great, he can always get a terrific cast to work with him, and the stories are usually pretty enticing.  I will tell you this, this movie is MUCH better than the atrocious The Wolfman from a few years ago.  Most of the things I enjoyed in the film are because of him.  As are the things I didn't enjoy.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film:<br />The Action<br /><br />It's too bad, this is an action film and the action is silly.  There are multiple action scenes with hundreds of henchmen at war with our Military.  Henchmen and soldiers alike are being killed so often, we don't feel any real loss.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, action should only compliment the story, not take it over.  The final action sequence was impressive though with many intricate camera shots.  Didn't totally leave a sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />The Score<br /><br />I feel I pay very close attention to film scores.  I can tell you which ones work and which ones don't in my opinion.  The average movie going public probably doesn't even care, but I do!  It didn't evoke emotion, it didn't make me care and I never felt like I was pulled into 100%.  The score should have been big, uplifting even.  This is Captain America damn it!  He's viewed as the leader of The Avengers and the score should have matched.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Liked it very much<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie very much.  I know I listed a few things I didn't like, but they weren't deal breakers.  It was great to see a modern day superhero in the past.  We grow with the character, figuratively and literally.  Steve Rogers is a good man who just lacked the physical stature to do great things.  He stood up for those who are bullied and did what was right.  I can't wait for The Avengers next year, it will be another chance to see Captain America in action!s impressive though with many intricate camera shots.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I'm one of those late arrivals to the Harry Potter world.  I never read any of J.K.Rowling books about the boy who lived.  I didn't know anything about the wizarding world, or witches, or where Hogwarts was.  I saw the first three films in the theaters, but skipped the rest.  Now?  Now, I love everything about the movies.  A few months ago when Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 was released on DVD; I started a Harry Potter marathon from the beginning.  I watched them all in order.  Since then, I've watched all the DVDs, four times.  That's 28 viewings of Harry Potter films all leading up to this.  The epic conclusion to the most successful (critical and commercial) series in cinema history.  Let me begin.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie:<br />The Story<br /><br />If this isn't obvious, I don't know what is.  An orphan wizard, magic spells, and an unknown connection to an evil wizard named Volemort.  The movie is easy to follow as a lot of the set up was done in earlier movies.  This is a balls to the wall action epic.  The final battle between Harry and the wizards against Voldemort and his army.  You really must see the previous films to fully appreciate the conclusions in this film.  The one thing that is important above all else... above all the explosions and magic and spells is simple... friendship.  The story of three best friends and their journey to this epic conclusion is unmatched by any other film I've ever seen.  THAT'S ultimately why these movies are so satisfying to so many people.  I don't want to say too much more, if you were looking for a plot summary, this review is not the place.<br /><br />Characters / Actors<br /><br />As with any great story, there must be great characters. And for 10+ years, the world enjoyed these characters.  Rowling has given the world so much.  And what this film has been able to do is showcase them all.<br /><br />I believe the supporting cast must be recognized.  The marvelous Ralph Fiennes as the evilLord Voldemort.  Alan Rickman as the mysterious Snape.  Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange.  Jason Isaacs and Tom Felton as Lucious and Draco Malfoy.  Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom.  And the lovely Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall.  There are many more.  Maybe they weren't showcased for long periods of time, but every hero, every villain and every wizard in between is included in the story.<br /><br />Then there are the three main characters, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) who really shine.  Their character development is key to the success of the film.  They each go through a transition and grow as a character.  It's amazing to think the producers have been able to keep all the same actors in tact for this epic series of films.  The best scenes in the movie involve the three best friends.  Like I've been saying all week... Harry, Ron and Hermione... I'll miss you.<br /><br />The Score<br /><br />The theme to Harry Potter was written back when the first film was released, by none other than John Williams.  The same brilliant man that brought us the scores to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman and so many more.  Alexandre Desplat scored HP and TDH Part 1, so it is fitting that he has returned to score the finale.  The score is beautiful.  I actually purchased it yesterday and I am listening to it as I type this review.<br /><br />The emotional weight of the score is vital to the story (you're going to read a lot about the emotional weight of the film in this review).  The music alone tells the story.  I was chatting with a friend about the film and told her I could discuss the score alone for hours.  And I really could.  The score was so impressive in relaying the emotion as well has elevating the action.  It was was enough to put me on the edge of my seat, literally.  And never forgetting the original theme created by Williams, it is weaved into this film as well.  Bravo Mr. Desplat.<br /><br />The Editing /Pacing / Tone<br /><br />This is something that doesn't get a lot of recognition in Hollywood, but it is so important to a movie like this.  If the editing and pacing is off, the entire movie crumbles.  You know by now there is a lot of emotion and also action in the movie.  How do you work those two together?  The editing is key.  Mark Day did an amazing job of keeping the film nice and neat.  There is no deviating from the plan.  For the most part, the film is told in chronological order, and there was a lot to cover.  The tone was perfect as well.  And I believe it is the marriage of cinematography, editing and score that sets the tone.  Great all around!<br /><br />The Director<br /><br />Really, what the score, editing, pacing and tone all come down to is the work of David Yates.  Yates has directed the last four Harry Potter films in the series.  And there is a reason for that.  He understood the material, he understood the world.  The producers of the films understood Yates is a fantastic director.  His work on this film proves you could have a huge Summer blockbuster, and still carry the emotional weight of a drama.  It was perfectly balanced and Yates is the man to thank.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the movie:<br />Length<br />Ironically, this is the shortest film in series.  If only that wasn't the case.  I understood Warner Brothers' motivation for splitting the two films in half.  But in retrospect, I wouldn't have split the movies where Yates did.  I would have included some of Part 1 in Part 2.  Just my opinion.  Maybe it's because I didn't want it to be over I was enjoying it so much!<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Amazing, what all Summer movies should be<br /><br />We've come to expect explosions and special effects in our Summer movies.  But what we are missing in most of those films is the emotional weight to make us care.  I know I keep repeating myself, but this movie made us care.  We felt invested in these characters and the final outcome of their stories.  This all goes back to Rowling and her writing.  Without her imagination, none of this comes true.  Brilliant, simply brilliant.<br /><br />While watching some of the special features, the producers refer to the films as a series, NOT a franchise. This is true; the movies are a series spanning 8 films to tell an overall story. It's not a franchise of unrelated events.  So to see the 8th and final film combine so much was amazing.  There are aspects and remnants of all the prior movies in this film.<br /><br />It was difficult to say goodbye to all the amazing characters, but the beauty of cinema is this... great stories and great films stay with us, forever.  Whether it's E.T. and Elliot's remarkable friendship, or Harry, Ron and Hermione causing trouble... we're reminded, through film, of what it was like to be a kid again.  I sat next to a little boy at a sold out screening and was mesmerized by his reaction to the film.  He laughed, he cried and he covered his eyes at times.  But he was so engaged in the film, it was an awesome sight.  Movies like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 give me hope for the future of cinema.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Giving this to one of my kids for Christmas and I know they are going to love this collection.  Blast off.
B004G6009U|4.0|It's been a while and I may be rusty, and I know I'm about 2 weeks late on this film, but let's get started. I am a male, and didn't really grow up knowing this fairy tale. I knew Tangled was originally titled &#34;Rapunzel&#34; though. Disney attributed the failure of The Princess & The Frog to one thing; little boys didn't want to see it. I enjoyed the that film, but could see where little boys had no desire to watch it. So Disney quickly changed it's title and marketing scheme; showcase the male character! And so the adventure began.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie:<br />The Animation<br />Pixar gets a lot of credit for their films, as well they should. Dreamworks has always been in second place with their films. Disney's in-house animation doesn't get the credit it deserves though. They now have three successful films in a row (Chicken Little & Bolt).<br /><br />This is probably the last time I'm going to list this on my &#34;likes&#34; list. The quality of the animation SHOULD be spectacular. The animators have no boundaries to make these films look amazing. Tangled does not let us down. From the different settings to all the various characters and of course, Rapunzel's insanely long hair. There are a few fight sequences that stand out in my mind that showcase the animation. There is one involving Rapunzel and the other involves the male lead character, Flynn Ryder, awesome!<br /><br />The Voice Acting<br />This is going to be a tough pill to swallow folks; but Mandy Moore did a great job as Rapunzel. There I said, don't make me say it again. So you know why that was tough... I can't STAND Mandy Moore's acting. This is sort of a nice fit for her though. She started as a singer and this movie showcases that &#34;talent&#34;.<br /><br />Zachary Levi from &#34;Chuck&#34; is a great lead. His character, Flynn Ryder, is funny, and this is due to Levi's delivery. The character has to be witty, charming and sarcastic, Levi conveyed all of those things. Ron Perlman, Jeffrey Tambor and Brad Garrett round out the supporting cast who are great.<br /><br />The Story/Heart<br />This is pretty cheesy to talk about, considering I'm almost 30 years old, but hey, it's true. Disney has always done well in this department. Their stories can be summarized into one sentence and this movie is no different; its about an innocent girl eager to learn more about the world. There is one scene in particular that has no dialogue that had my wife and I reaching for tissues. You'll know it when you see it, as most of the people in our theater were teared up (it was a packed house by the way).<br /><br />What I didn't like about the movie:<br />The Settings<br />One thing Pixar does so well is create a larger than life experience in their films. Whether its Nemo in the ocean or Woody and Buzz in a daycare, they create these amazing worlds for the characters. Tangled didn't offer up the same. Most of the movie takes place in the tower where Rapunzel is being held captive. When our characters do venture out into the world, it's not very far. There's the woods, a bar and the tiny village. It didn't have the scope of other Disney films like Aladdin for example. With Aladdin, you felt how big Agrabah was, the marketplace, the palace, etc.<br /><br />There really wasn't too much else I didn't like. I wish there was just a bit more humor to appeal to adults, but overall I was very entertained the entire time. The cast was great, the story was solid and the execution was there. The songs were very fitting on the story and that's always nice, unlike some B movies out there. I would recommend this movie to young and old, but keep in mind it's very G Rated. My wife and I watched in 2D and believe me, it was just fine that way. Save your money and avoid the 3D version, I just don't see it adding much to the experience. Other than that, be a kid for 2 hours, go see Tangled, and you wont regret it.
B004J64QSI|5.0|a stellar cast in an outstanding musical with the original 1985 cast at the end including the writers and producer
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Ever since the trailer debuted, I knew I wanted to see this movie.  Warrior is directed by Gavin O'Connor.  He directed another great sports film, Miracle.  In this film, we get not one, not two, but three great performances by very gifted actors.  Tom Hardy (Inception), plays Tommy Conlon, a Marine veteran.  He has just returned from the Middle East and is finding it extremely difficult to live a normal life.  Joel Edgerton (King Arthur) plays Brendan Conlon; a physics teacher and former UFC fighter trying to save his home from foreclosure.  The men's father is played by Nick Nolte; a former alcoholic and terrible father to the boys when they were growing up.  Now the brothers enter a Mixed Martial Arts tournament for redemption, and ironically, to bring their family back together.<br /><br />What I liked about the film:<br />The Story<br /><br />I don't normally explain plot in my reviews, but I have to divulge a little bit here.  The story of the brothers is so good, so intriguing, we're drawn into the film.  At a pivotal age, the brothers are separated due to extreme circumstances (I wont spoil why here).  They each have resentment towards the other, and both resent their abusive, alcoholic father.  But the story is not thrown in your face with flashing lights.  We discover the pain the brothers have gone through in bits and pieces.  All of which comes to light before the finale of the tournament, when the brothers fight each other.  Don't worry, I didn't spoil anything the trailers didn't tell you already.  I also liked how the MMA fighting takes a backseat to the hurt in their hearts.  The best sports films focus on the person, not the sport.<br /><br />The Acting<br /><br />Tom Hardy attracted a lot of attention after Inception.  In this film we see a different side of him.  He's angry, bitter and relentless.  But at the same time, he is reserved and in charge.  He walks a fine line between controlled and crazy so well, we never know what he's going to do onscreen.  Joel Edgerton has to play a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders.  A mortgage he can't afford, hospital bills, a sick daughter, an absent father and a failed UFC fighter.  His character is the underdog, one that will never quit.  Then there is Nick Nolte, who plays a man trying to get sober.  He's been clean for almost 3 years and is trying his hardest to patch things up with his sons. The three men are riveting.  I was floored by the three men's interactions.  Compelling and entertaining, amazing.<br /><br />The Action / Cinematography<br /><br />The Mixed Martial Arts in the movie is nicely shot.  There are some wide shots from the bleachers, as well as up-close, in your face action shots. The character development scenes are nicely shot. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi creates tension with a slightly bouncy camera shot that feels like it's someone eavesdropping on the conversation.  Great stuff.<br /><br />The Score<br />I've said it before and I'll say it again; score is so incredibly vital to a movie.  As I've gotten older, I've developed an ear for the score in films.  And one thing I noticed is, score can make or break a sports film.  Mark Isham creates a wonderful soundtrack that evokes tremendous emotion.  The highs are extremely high and the lows are extremely low.  Nicely done.<br /><br />The Climax<br /><br />I have been fortunate enough to be blessed with an incredible brother.  He has been my best friend since he was born.  We've lived together as room mates until the day I was married.  And with that being said, we had some great fights throughout our lives.  But there's something about a brother's love that can't be explained.  You can fight and hurt each other, only to make up five minutes later.  The climax of the movie is the culmination of years of pain and suffering by both men.  They both have pent up anger and frustration towards the other.  They are both fighting to move on from a troubled past.  They're both fighting for prize money that will solve their economic woes.  The fight itself, along with the aforementioned cinematography and score create an unbelievable build up to the climax.  I wont give anything away, but I will tell you this; my sold-out theater went from weeping for the characters to literally a standing ovation.  It was so powerful, and so emotionally gripping, it will stay with me for a long long time.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film:<br />The Pacing<br /><br />I understand pacing and editing are purposefully done (for the most part).  But the first and second act (before the tournament) needed to be touched up a bit.  There are character development moments essential to the build up; however, there are other scenes that needed to be re-cut and sped up.  It is my opinion that these long, drawn out scenes could have been cut down and you wouldn't lose anything towards the overall story arc.<br /><br />The Verdit:<br />An amazing metaphor on so many levels<br /><br />Sports can be a great metaphor for the different struggles in our lives.  The underdog vs. the front runner, picking yourself back up, feeling like we're up against the ropes, etc.  Commentary on the wars in the Middle East, alcoholism, our country's current economic downturn, the housing market and drug use are all touched on in this two hour film.  Give it up to great writers, a great director, terrific acting and a solid story.  It's very VERY rare I see a movie twice in the theaters, but this will definitely be one of them.  Now everyone call your brothers and tell them how much you love them.  Then go see this film with them.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I was expecting more but that the movie and the story line was just ok.  I can't remember all of it because it didn't keep my attention.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Battleship, the movie?  Sounds terrible right?  A movie based on a board game where the objective was basically to guess coordinates.  Well, Peter Berg didn't see it that way.  From the minute he signed on as director, he was begging audiences to give his film a chance.  When the studio saw that American's were already 'knockin' it before tryin' it', they decided to release the movie overseas a month before the United States.  The outcome?  Well, let's go.<br /><br />What I liked about the film:<br />The Story<br /><br />The STORY, not the script.  The story is quite simple really.  Aliens have crash landed on earth to take over satellite communication with their home planet.  By creating a force field around a small fleet of Navy ships, the aliens have forced the fight on water.  The script is being shredded by critics, and for good reason.  But the story was simple enough to justify the existence of the aliens on our planet, and in turn &#34;justifying&#34; the action.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch's character is a hot headed young man who's joined the Navy after his older brother (played by Alexander Skarsgard), refuses to financially support him any longer.  Skarsgard's character is a captain in the Navy and is the man in charge once the navy begins their war on the aliens.  What's important to note is, Kitsch's character actually does experience a growth, a nice arc.  He may not be the best actor doing these genre films, but he is getting better with every performance.<br /><br />The Action/Special Effects<br /><br />It's not an easy feat to create a war over water.  As an audience, we've come to expect the best of the best.  The movie creates action set pieces that have never been seen before.  Another complaint I'm reading online is, the movie completely disregards physics... really?!  What did you expect?  This is a movie about aliens invading Earth for satellite communication!  Come on people.  Writers Eric and Jon Hoeber wrote a simple,action packed script with some bad cliches.  But Berg choreographed some great action that made even the most mundane objectives exciting.  I especially liked the way the filmmaker incorporated the simple strategy of the board game into the film, without throwing it right in our faces.  Those hating on this aspect of the film need to get over it.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film:<br />The Characters<br /><br />Beyond Kitsch's character, there is not much more to be proud of for the writers.  The great Liam Neeson is restricted to a few scenes from a chair.  Brooklyn Decker plays his daughter, and Kitsch's love interest... for no reason.  She literally serves no purpose to the film, other than eye candy.  Then there is singer/actress Rihanna.  She is a pleasure to look at, but again, has nothing to do in the film that a nameless character couldn't have done for her.  The trailer sold her as the daughter of a Navy veteran who predicted the alien attacks.  But the script does nothing to further explore that one line of dialogue.<br /><br />The Cliches<br /><br />Speaking of the dialogue.  The writers must have tried their best to put in every action film cliche into the script.  There is the &#34;Mahalo Mother F-----&#34;, BOOM, SHOT TO THE FACE.  There is the slow motion walk used in countless action films.  Only in this film, it's a set of 1940's Navy veterans asked to be a part of the final action sequence.  No seriously, I didn't make that up.  I wonder if the studio asks writers to put these things in their scripts?  Does anyone know?  I'd be curious to find out.  Nonetheless, a silly script with silly dialogue of course.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Berg &#62; Bay<br /><br />The above equation says it all for me.  I'll take a Peter Berg movie over a Michael Bay film any day of the week.  The similarities between Battleship and Transformers can not be ignored.  Berg however has a way of making the action more meaningful, placing more importance on theheroics of our main characters.  The movie is not great, by any means.  But by no means is it as bad as I thought it would be.  In fact, I rather enjoyed the mind numbing action.  There are a ton of 'money shots' to get hypnotized by.  I believe it is going to flop in theaters, and maybe this is the film to finally get through Hollywood's thick skull.  More original material (Inception), less tie-ins (Transformers).  Either way, take a date to this movie and enjoy the eye candy for two hours.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Decent sequel movie.  I liked the story line and I have watched it a couple times now so I guess that says something.
1419703692|5.0|This is the most compressive collection of artwork, photos and interviews, with all the filmmakers of this amazing trilogy.  The large format allows for great detail in every photo.  There is an equal amount of content from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight; with just a bit less from The Dark Knight Rises.  If you've ever watched the special features on the DVDs or Blu-Rays, you'll recognize a lot of the preproduction work done on the films.  This book documents everything from the writing process to the editing of the films.<br /><br />It's a great coffee table piece, or gift for Batman fans.  I enjoyed it and I'm sure anyone who buys it will too.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Liked the story line.  I wouldn't say I liked it as much as the last one with the joker, but I thought it was still good and worth watching.
B007XIC1GI|1.0|The description of this book made it sound more interesting than it actually was. The behind-the-scenes stories didn't really inspire me to care, and it felt more like they were written for a teenager full of angst than a fan who has been a part of Marilyn Manson's success through all the years. The plot (if there was such a thing) of the biography was riddled with stories and events that didn't seem to have much of anything to do with the emergence and success of the band itself. I would have liked more embellishments of how songs were created, what inspired different tracks and albums, how certain live shows left an impression on the band than others, and stories from their history that gave some thanks to the fans that made them famous. This book really missed connecting with fans. The book needed more &#34;We met with a band/fan/group who really inspired us to do XYZ...&#34; as opposed to &#34;I've done all these things that most people haven't done and that makes me different and special and you'll never understand me or be like me because I'm so different than everybody else.&#34; Maybe someday Brian will take the performance mask off and write a true memoir himself that connects better. This one was really just another show that we've already seen.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Another dumb movie by Oliver Stone.  I know he's a big name but I think the last few movies that's he done have been really lame.

0385535147|1.0|I feel like every time I read contemporary literature today written by established uber wealthy and famous authors (Stephen King, Robert Parker, John Grisham etc.), I'm in the middle of a political rally. When literature becomes an excuse for state propaganda, it's a sad day. Stale prose doesn't help.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pitch Perfect is so much fun! For me, Pitch Perfect is the most fun movie of 2012. Quick wit like the name of her a capello group was the minstrel cycles, or Treble Makers, or A cabellas. Would you please get your head out of your asp; it's not a hat. Lots of one-liners, and of course, great singing. Very upbeat. Light-hearted fun! This movie is a great pick-me-up!

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Couldn't get this to work properly.  No tutorial, so I spent about 2 to 3 minutes and died.  Never could do anything.  If I approached an animal, it killed me and fighting back was useless.  If I didn't approach any animals, there was nothing to do.  You could walk around for an hour and nothing happens, so I don't understand the point.  Maybe if there had been a tutorial.  Not sure if the non-demo version of this game does anything better, but couldn't recommend it based on this demo.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|The cameos in this movie saved it from being a complete failure. I thought the premise was completely moronic and found little to no redeeming value at all. If you can watch it for free then it might be worth your time, but I wouldn't pay more than $0 for it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Challenging and fun.  All puzzles are solvable if you have the patience to figure them out.  I played this on my Kindle Fire.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Very funny movie although definitely not for kids.  Was amazed at times with how much Seth could get away with in terms of stretching the boundaries of comedy and political correctness!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The photography alone makes this a great movie, but Peter O'Toole does a marvelous job of portraying T. E. Lawrence.  Another movie to watch over and over again to see the subtle acting that O'Toole gives in order to show the mental nuances of this character.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love all kinds of solitaire. If you do not win, you can choose to play it over and over again until you do or just go to the next game.  I have played it on my iphone especially while we travel. Now I am playing it on my new Kindle Fire which also gives you choices on what difficulty to choose.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|Great movie.  A most have for every video library.  Alec Guiness is priceless in this movie.  Without giving away the ending (although everyone should know it by now) you don't realize the mental instability of his character until almost the end.  His acting is subtle, so this is a good movie to watch again and again in order to pick up on his subtle mental changes throughout the movie.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Since I first heard about this movie, I could hardly wait to see it.  My son has a speech disorder, so the basis of the movie hit close to home.  I finally saw it last night, and the word that comes to mind is \\"brilliant\\"; The King's Speech was brilliantly written and brilliantly acted.  Helena Bonham-Carter (the king's wife) did a beautiful job of portraying the emotion involved watching someone you love struggle to find their voice.  The anticipation, the way our hearts and minds almost attempt to will those words to come for them, was palpable in Bonham Carter's performance.  Colin Firth brought the king's character to life with such incredible intensity and passion that I didn't doubt his authenticity for a second.  This movie was well-researched and addressed so much of what people with speech disorders go through, and did so in a way that was neither sugary-sweet nor overly pessimistic.  The King's Speech is inspiring, and while it is not riveting in the action-drama sense, it never lost my interest during the entire two hours.  While, admittedly, the movie has a greater appeal to me because of my son's speech disorder and my understanding of how truly genius the writing and acting were, the movie is an absolute winner independent of that fact.  Just...brilliant.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great app. really enjoy it. graphics are wonderful. new twist around every corner. only downfall is you have to buy diamonds.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am a huge Harry Bosch fan.  I have read every one of them.  This is another great read for Bosch fans, but for those who have never read Mr. Connelly you will not be able to put the book down.  I love the way Harry follows every litttle clue, anything that might lead him to the &#34;black box&#34;, the real mystery solver.  Harry always gets &#34;his man&#34; and this one is so much fun to find out just how he does it.  I highly recommend this book.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Im not very good at league of legends so I thought to give this a try and it was really fun try it
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This batman movie was the best written the best directed and the best cast of actors you could want from a movie of this magnatudie, simply the best
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|During the entire movie, i did not stop to find myself not laughing. To be honest i was fascinated by the stupidity of the acts that this man and his bear would partake on. And on the plus mila kunis is in this movie and she is a beauty. Overall i picked the rating that i did; for the great actors that played in this movie, the good script that was written and the laughter it got me.
1400069289|3.0|It is definitely not a self help type book. Mostly it just gives an analysis of studies that have been done that show the power of habit on peoples buying habits. Some interesting stuff on how companies use market information to decide on advertising and promotion. The book can give you insight on some of your buying habits and how you think of products, but this book doesn't really give much guidance on how individuals can improve their lives by understanding their own personal habits in everyday life.
