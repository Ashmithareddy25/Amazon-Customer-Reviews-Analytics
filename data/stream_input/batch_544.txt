B000AL730O|5.0|This is an excellent album.  Songs like Jenny Wren,Too much rain,Riding to vanity fair stand alongside Paul's best works.  There is an overall introspective,moody feel to the album - which is probably a reflection of Paul's current life.  Without any doubt this is a great album.
B00005R24K|5.0|the 1st time i saw this i was blown away by how gorey it was.<br /><br />yes the acting could be a bit better. but damn it is nonstop action. chainsaws,axes,dead bodies oh my! this is a great cult classic. its like the night of the living dead on crack.<br /><br />i love it

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna made her mark with dance music and proves she is the best in that genre.  Whether you're twentysomething and go to dance clubs or of her generation and more likely to hit the gym, the whole CD makes you want to move your body...and keep going!  It's great how every song segues to the next.  Some have complained that it doesn't have deep lyrics...well, what do you want, it's DANCE music, not folk!  But having said that, the lyrics in \\"Forbidden Love\\" make the song stand out even in the first listen, like a story.  Close your eyes, and the music takes you to the dance floor with smokey, swooping lights and strobes... <br />   One of the best CDs of the year, and best from Madonna in a while.
B000092Q7O|5.0|Roman Polanski's \\"The Pianist\\" tracks the incredible struggle for survival of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist in 1930s Warsaw. As the film opens, Wladyslaw is recording on Polish radio, but a bombing raid forces him out of the studio and into the panicked streets. We soon meet his family: a headstrong brother, gentle sisters, and aged parents who are aghast at the more and more extreme measures taken to dehumanize Polish Jews: wearing armbands, not allowed to walk on sidewalks, not allowed to sit on benches in public parks or eat in Gentile establishments, and finally, the move to the Ghetto. Wladyslaw's tight-knit family struggles to stay together as conditions become more and more dire.<br /><br />The film traces the disintegration of order in Warsaw from 1939 to 1945. Wladyslaw's life goes to new lows as the Ghetto is evacuated to the work (death) camps, and he must go into hiding, his situation becoming more and more dire as he is forced to flee from place to place and scrabble for food. He is taken advantage of, nearly dies from jaundice, and is nearly killed several times, but throughout the music in his head, heart and fingertips still burns brightly. Towards the end of the war, a single act of kindness by a Nazi commander proves that there is still decency in humanity, and finally Wladyslaw is once more able to give the world his musical gift over Polish radio.<br /><br />This film, while perhaps not on the same level as Schindler's list (there is very little dialogue for much of the film, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it becomes an almost Cast Away tale of solitary survival at its rawest), highlights the indignities perpetrated against European Jews. Dead bodies litter the streets, and the Nazis indiscriminately kill or humiliate whoever they so desire. Human dignity has no worth. The film's violence serves to underscore how much like animals humans can become, filled with primitive blood lust, or like the Jews in the Ghetto, forced to survive on an animal level: an old man attacks an old woman to steal her food, and as the mush splashes on the filthy pavement, he hungrily stuffs it into his mouth off the ground. This is powerful filmmaking, based in part on some of Polanski's own remembrances. (Rated R for graphic violence).to survive on an animal level: an old man attacks an old woman to steal her food, and as the mush splashes on the filthy pavement, he hungrily stuffs it into his mouth off the ground.

0553801503|5.0|Alot of you people have written that there is too much useless info in the book. Hello! What are you, stupid? When do you get alot of information about something that hasn't been put to good use? When we learn about all these new people and places, it adds to the already richness of the story. This book, and probably the next(both being the same book but split in two), will be set-up books. To reach the climax, or the top of the hill, you need to tread on the steps first. These two books are the steps to the climax, or as I like to call it, the feast. So, if there are too many characters and too many places and too many concepts for you, loser, then try something of a smaller scope-Velveteen Rabbit.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Even though this has a five-star rating with more than 280 reviews in, I think it's worth restating what a gem this DVD really is.   <br /> <br />The quality of the performances is top-notch, from the brilliant Indian pieces music and the Python segment right through to the efforts of Clapton, McCartney, Petty et al.  The artists were chosen perfectly with all having had real connections to George (there were none of the usual artists who pile on at tribute time).  Clapton gets a free pass through the Pearly Gates for the way he put together the musical components of the show. <br /> <br />The real reason I want to comment on this, though, is the quality of the production.  It's a visual delight.  <br /> <br />In an age where rapid-fire editing is absolutely ruining a lot of (most?) concert DVDs, this film gets it right.  The camera work is by no means static, but there's no ADD-induced jumping around either.  Shots are held long enough and there are plenty of perspective shots of the ensemble.  The cameras acknowledge the audience but don't keep coming back to it.  Which means the viewer can savour the concert - musically AND visually - without being distracted by superficial editing nonsense. <br /> <br />In short, it's perfect.  Or it would have been had George made the gig! <br /> <br />
B0000019PA|5.0|The theme of the album, as you may know, is the life of Anne Frank. Or more specifically the time she was hidden in an attic room in Amsterdam and the fate that later befell her.  <br /> <br />This is like watching a play or a concert put on by the occupants of those cramped rooms. The costumes are homemade out of what they can find. The performances are amateur but endearing. The audience applaud even the mistakes. The instruments sometimes sound cracked and broken as they \\"... dance round the room to accordion keys\\". But as a lump may have been brought to the throat of the proud parents, so will you find this at times. <br /> <br />The title track is quite wonderful, and so are the two parts of Two Headed Boy.  <br /> <br />The cover art comes from an earlier Edwardian period but wouldn't this be the same for some of the family's cherished possessions? Perhaps an old toy, or a sewing box. <br /> <br />Its an album that's been painstakingly put together, and Magnum has produced one of the very few pieces in the \\"Popular Music\\" cannon that can also be judged as a work of Art. His genuine feeling for the subject permeates the whole, and the lyrics, although at times obscure, are worth your efforts, as they span the whole claustrophobic and sometimes sexually charged atmosphere - \\"Your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies. While you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park\\", together with the soaring escapism of Anne's diary \\"Anna's ghost all around. Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me soft and sweet. How the notes all bend and reach above the trees\\" , and graphically illustrate the barbarity of her fate - \\"And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />At just under 40 minutes the album flies by. <br /> <br />You should buy this and cherish it.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Sure the lyrics are on the weak side and the themes are the same thing she's been going on about since Ray Of Light, but at least she has a message unlike most of her peers (i.e., Mariah, Kylie, etc.) The album was marketed as a message free dance-a-thon but that is not the case. Most of the songs are pretty dancey but not a lot is out and out dance. And the last half is centered around her views of fame, family, kabballocks, and what not. <br /> <br />This record is certainly a step up from American Life. While AL wasn't a bad album it was lacking in melody and memorable hooks that COADF has in abundance. Though I really wish she'd get over this minimalist kick she got on with Music and start writing better lyrics again. Oh well. <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up,\\" \\"Get Together,\\" and \\"Sorry\\" are a pop gold trilogy. \\"Future Lovers\\" is a grower while \\"I Love New York\\" is a rocking tune if you ignore the lyrics (york/dork, mad/sad/glad). \\"Let It Will Be\\" can be a bit plodding at first but really builds and takes off. \\"Forbidden Love,\\" \\"Jump,\\" and \\"How High\\" are the second trilogy. All single worthy. \\"Isaac\\" and \\"Push\\" are growers to but take effort to really appreciate. That guy on Isaac is irksome to me and Push is a bit to Gwenish. \\"Like It Or Not\\" finishes off a fine album, maybe some questionable couplets, but a good song. Oh I forgot to mention the vocoder/robo singing effects are perfection. <br /> <br />The Queen is back and looking sexy in leotards.
B00000634L|1.0|This album is some of the worst noise ever recorded.  The only good (and radio-friendly) song is \\"Everywhere\\".  Every other track is horrible, horrible noise.  It's basically a patchwork of samples that don't even make 'music' when put together.  I would give it one-third of 1 star.  After I forced myself to listen to the entire thing, I gave it to my dog to go bury in the backyard.  For the love of God, don't waste your time!!
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Danny Elfman's score begins. I hate Danny Elfman, but of course he would be used, he's in every one of Burton's endeavors. A CGI factory makes CGI chocolate in what seems like a mockery of the same imagery used to make cookies in the beginning of Edward Scissorhands... the narrator starts; in Burton's typical fairy-tale style comes images of fairy-tale times with fairy-tale dilapidated old houses, and I'm really beginning to not like it until...<br /><br />...it all sucks you in. You watch Charlie's family as they anticipate the finders of the Golden Tickets, and their quite acute comments on the nature of the winners. You watch as Charlie simultaneously tries to hide his hope and maintain it at the same time, along with his family's fluctuating eagerness to get a Golden Ticket. And as Charlie finds a ten dollar bill on the ground, you suddenly realize, \\"Geez, this movie's a lot like the book... well, of course it was one dollar and not ten dollars, but who's really counting?\\" And a lot like the book it stays, with a few minor deviations which frankly are brilliant. Wonka's flashbacks into his childhood are perfect addendums to Depp's quirky new creation of the beloved character that most could not separate from Wilder, and in the end Wilder's character is still maintained because he is not blaspheme'd. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make a new Willy Wonka that is standalone enough that all thought of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory becomes mere nitpicking by people annoyed by change.<br /><br />In fact, considering the book, Willy Wonka movie, and Charlie movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is truly brilliant. It holds true to the book while still maintaining cinematic appeal by becoming it's own thing. It is not a remake of Willy Wonka, and thank God (or just Burton, as it was his choice anyways, right?) for that, because even though I like the older version, remakes are just incredibly tedious.<br /><br />Special appeal to Burton fans would be the almost demented acting of Johnny Depp... the strange grins when kids get in trouble, the timid voice when he becomes unsure of himself, the reclusive germophobe he makes of a once maudlin and glurgy character. In fact, all the characters are perfectly translated to the screen, even if they do look like porcelain dolls from time to time (I hypothesize this comes from the drawings found in many of Rhoad Dahl's books).<br /><br />Another great aspect of this movie is it's adherence to the musical bits in the book without really being a musical itself. Other than one other song, the Oompa Loompas sing everything, and though their music isn't really that good (I'd like to have it on a CD for laughs, but I don't really care for it otherwise), at least the situations are pretty funny, especially since all of the Oompa Loompas have the same face... and aren't like Munchkins.<br /><br />Another good thing to focus on is the insane amount of allusions.  Did I say \\"mockery of Edward Scissorhands\\"?  It's no mockery, the beginning channels that work for a reason.  Kubrick, Hitchcock, and Burton's own films are easy catches, but can you catch all of the homages in this film?<br /><br />As the movie progresses, it deviates more and more from the book, which is fine because it feels at that point like the trust has been salvaged. If people are still worrying about details so far into this movie, then I don't really see how they enjoy very many movies at all. About the time we reach the television room scene, it begins to feel a little tedious but right then wraps up everything pretty nicely (not to say there isn't more good stuff to come, but I'm not going to give away ALL the details). Eventually the credits roll and I'm suddenly realizing, \\"Wow, that was two hours... felt like two minutes.\\" A sure sign of a pretty good movie if there is one.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBmost demented acting of Johnny Depp... the strange grins when kids get in trouble, the timid voice when he becomes unsure of himself, the reclusive germophobe he makes of a once maudlin and glurgy character.

B00005JNX0|3.0|If they would have made the Penguins the main part of the movie and  the other 4 the sub-plot then we would have had a definite winner on our hands, but instead we get a decent Dreamworks movie with a few very funny, great scenes. I have a great idea for a movie people, check this out.....Take all the supporting characters from all these movies (Donkey from Shrek, Dori from Nemo, the penguins from this, the Jamaican characters from Shark Tale, Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story 1 & 2, the crazy squirrel from Ice Age) and give each and every one of them there own movies, cuz' most of them are all better then the main characters they are \\"supporting\\"<br /><br />Anyway, enough of that, back to the movie. It seems Marty the Zebra (Decent vocals by Chris Rock) wants to go back to the wild, and he and his 3 buddies get carted up and get shipped away on a boat. Of course they somehow fall overboard and end up on this island (Madagascar) There they fall in with some Lemurs and Foosa's (Still not sure what the hell these were) while trying to avoid becoming lunch from Alex the lion, who is a good lion, but is seeing everyone as steaks, cuz' the poor guy is missin' life at the zoo!!!<br /><br />Ben Stiller actually overdoes it as Alex the lion, he is non-stop chatter and it gets kinda annoying after a while, shut him up and let the penguins have some more screen time. David Schwimmer is the Giraffe, nothing special here, maybe a few funny lines when he is stuck in his crate, but that's about it. Then there is Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria the hippo, completely useless and really not needed in this movie at all, very few lines, even fewer funny or even decent lines, get rid of her so our penguins can have some more time!!!!!<br /><br />The chemistry between any of these animals is not very strong, Alex and Marty are supposed to be best friends but ya don't feel it, the animation is decent, not at a Shrek or Nemo level, but still fun to watch.<br /><br />The positives? Gee, what do you think I'm gonna say? OH HELL YEAH!!! THE PENGUINS BABY!!! they absolutely steal the show, every scene they are in is hilarious, problem is, they just aren't in it too much. They are military in everything they do and the jokes never stop coming and all of them work. Towards the end they are sunning themselves on the beach deciding wether or not to tell our heroes that the boat they think is going to get them home is outta gas, gotta love it...<br /><br />Here is what you do, when you get to the main menu, scroll until you find the penguins short movie called \\"Christmas Caper\\" watch that, it's better then the movie and ya don't get those other 4 animals.......<br /><br />acting.....2.5 stars, Too much Stiller and Pinkett-Smith<br />directing....3 stars, Maybe a little generous, some fun too be had<br />special effects....3 stars, Lemur dance scene is awesome<br />comedy rating....2.5 stars, Some good laughs, some not so good<br />quality........4 stars, Most of the CG looks amazing, few gliches, nothin' serious though.L YEAH!!!

0440237688|5.0|I was always encouraged to read this in middle school, but I never got around to it.  Now I'm a twenty-something, and we selected this for a book club discussion, and I was completely blown away!  I highly recommend this as a book club selection because it is short enough that everyone can finish it on time, but it packs a serious punch and there are dozens of published discussion questions and ways to explore the book.<br /><br />There's no need for me to recount the plot in this review, and doing so wouldn't explain why this book is so essential.  It has timeless themes, one that will be studied by students for years to come, I am sure.  This is an outstanding book for any teacher wanting to discuss diversity, and how our individualism makes our world so wonderful.  My one word of caution is that the book is deceptively simple to read.  I've heard of 5th and 6th grade teachers teaching the book, and while it is technically readable at that grade level, some of the themes about reproduction, adolesence, and the like are more appropriate for students who are just a few grades more advanced.  Other reviewers have mentioned the age-appropriateness of this book, too.  I recommend it to middle schoolers, no younger, despite the fact that it is technically readable at a younger age.  Middle school students will be able to identify with the changes Jonas is going through as he matures.

And Brando once again teams with his acting partner Karl Malden from Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront. This was before Brando started going off the deep end as he did in such films as Missouri Breaks.

This movie does a decent job of capturing his energy and musical genius.  I challenge you to find a cd with the musical diversity of this one.  Most musicians can't reproduce there studio recordings in live shows.  This is the only musician I know that is better live then recorded.  Please don't think this is his only cd that is worth buying.  His body of music is great from start to finish.  Show me a better guitarist.
0385510454|3.0|This book meanders like nothing else.  There was some sharp political and legal action, and then Grisham got completely lost in character development.  There were paper-thin plot strands running around everywhere that didn't get tied up by the end of the novel.<br /><br />So many reviewers have said it, but I need to add my voice--this book is a love affair with Italy.  There is no reason for our main character to be hiding in this foreign country, not knowing the language, other than as a convenient plot device for Grisham to throw out Italian history and culture.  Is this a travel guide or a legal thriller? (It is the former, for most of the novel.)<br /><br />The absolute worst is Grisham's closing notes, in which he explains that he knows little of electronic gadgets and espionage.  Is this supposed to be some lame apology for not doing his research correctly before writing a book about modern internet-based espionage?  Email is a mystery in this book--it can be instantly 100% secure when it is convenient to the author, completely unbreakable, or, if he needs it as a plot device, Grisham can devote pages to complicated adventures to thwart email spies.  Please, do your homework and write a consistent novel!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|[...] And it's amazing to me that Madonna can even effect people like that. I love Mariah, but don't compare the two. MADONNA is a TRENDSETTING, CREATIVE, EVER EVOLVING artist, and MARIAH still think she's a teenager singing DAYDREAM. On to the CD.     WOW.     First of all, this is a dance record. So don't expect \\"RAY OF LIGHT\\" lyrics, because its meant to be pure fun, not analytical. The lyrics and hooks are meant to be SIMPLE, CATCHY, and DANCEABLE - like most DISCO and 70's/80's dance songs. A lot of kids who don't know music are comparing this to KYLIE M. type dance. Don't you know that Madonna was doing the BIRTH of that music with 80's early-techno songs like EVERYBODY and BURNING UP?     What 47 year old you know, and Mariah's getting there, can turn out something like this? It's ENTRANCING! I bought it today and haven't been able to get past the first three tracks! \\"GET TOGEHTER\\" and \\"FUTURE LOVERS\\" is MESMERIZING! and I hope they're singles.     THERE'S SOMETHING 4 EVERYONE HERE. Especially if you like disco, ambience, triphop, house, r&b, pop, techno, and even bits of rock -this will make your day. If not, you probably won't like it. To me its pointless to compare this to other works of hers, because she has changed and is certainly not the same person she was 2, 5, 10+ years ago. I'm not rating songs. Each person will like different tracks.     It's NOT a PERFECT CD by any means, and in my opinion certainly NOT THE BEST, but it ranks up there with them respectively. So go in with an open mind, and no pre-judgements.  MADONNA HAS COME FULL CIRCLE WITH THIS.   CHECK IT OUT!
1400032717|1.0|i read this book over the summer as a high school reading requirement. I read the whole book but I tell you that it was very painful to read...cause i can say 2 words about it...it sucks. I mean this book had a dry and plain plot with uninteresting characters. Christopher had no personality and his father was a major a**hole. I was tricked into thinking that this was a good book by the synopsis on the back. It was so boring i kept putting it down after ever 17 pages. Besides being boring this book had so much explict languge it's not even funny--they said the f word more than 60 times. Please avoid this book at all costs.
0553801503|2.0|Okay, you are going to buy this anyway.  So that's not what this review is about cause we all have to have this book, you know that.  But I'm totally lost on this one.  I gave it 2 stars because of the huge conglomeration of people, names, politics, and just freekin STUFF that Mr. Martin somehow manages to keep track of cause I sure can't.  I am going to follow the advice of previous reviewers and skip this one and pray to Orlando Bloom and Hugh Jackman (I worship these guys, the two sexiest monkeys on the planet)that he gives us a synopsis in the next one.
0307276902|5.0|I read the book and I very much enjoyed it.  I read very infrequently because usually books bore me.  Music is more my niche than reading for whatever reason.  This book however was the exact opposite.  It drew my attention so much that I neglected doing anything BUT read this book start to finish.  My mother got me this book after seeing the author James Frey on \\"Oprah\\".  It turns out that many of my friends parents got them the book.  Not a one didn't enjoy it.  I liked this so much that I am most definately getting his other book \\"My Friend Leonard\\".  Apparently its based on his friend Leonard from this book.  Im so excited!!!  Someone told me that Jame's girlfriend in the book has a book out about her life as well.  Can't find that one.  When and if i do Im not going to hesitate to get it.  This book is one of the most motivational writings i've ever read.  I highly reccomend it to everyone and anyone.  If you are an addict or alcoholic you'll find that it inspires you as well as reminds you vividly of what you dont wanna go back to.  If your not an addict or alcoholic but a family member or friend of an addict or alcoholic (i would guess that 95% of people are friends or know someone thats has this devistating disease), then your priviledged to get a front row exhibit of what alcoholisim and addiction are all about! <br /> <br />I myself am a heroin and crack addict.  Despite numerous treatments of all different varieties, I always go back.  My addiction has brought me to places out of a horror movie (physically, mentally, and emotionally).  Currently, my addiction is running rampant.  Despite offerings of rehab, meetings, and doctors, I continued to decline.  Continued until I started reading this book.  This book has motivated me more than ANYTHING I have ever encountered.  I am now a week away from entering a 6 month treatment facility.  And until then I'm gonna read Frey's next book \\"My Friend Leonard\\", and tough out the sickness.  Thanks to Frey for theseunbelievabe pages of motivation and inspiration.  And for those of you pondering getting this book.  I highly reccomend it, more than highly reccomend it.  I require it!!!

0895260131|5.0|To the reviewer below who speaks of the \\"sad state of things\\": I'd say people writing reviews of books they obviously haven't read is pretty sad.  Does this guy actually think Spencer doesn't deal with the absurd \\"jihad refers merely to internal struggle\\" argument?  Or that he doesn't address the supposed \\"no compulsion in religion\\" argument? <br /> <br />Spencer's book is not the product of ignorance.  Calling Islam the \\"religion of peace\\" is the product of ignorance. <br /> <br />Spencer clearly notes that most Muslims are neither evil nor inclined toward terrorism.  What he does say is that everything a jihadist needs from an ideological point of view is just waiting there in Islamic teaching for him to exploit. <br /> <br />And don't give me the argument that Christians have had their faults too, since that proves you haven't read the book.  Spencer answers this argument.  If you disagree with his perspective, fine, but if you're going to prove to me that you read the book you at least have to acknowledge that it exists. <br /> <br />The fact is, whenever a suicide bombing occurs these days, no one says, \\"There go the Methodists again!\\"  Why is that, exactly?  And what exactly is wrong with at least posing the question? <br /> <br />As for the \\"no compulsion in religion,\\" Spencer shows that major Islamic scholars consider those peaceful verses to be \\"cancelled\\" today.  Islamic apologists like the one-star reviewers here then cite the peaceful verses, without mentioning that they've been \\"cancelled,\\" and then have the nerve to accuse SPENCER of taking Islamic verses out of context! <br /> <br />Read this book for yourself and see which side of this debate is really playing fast and loose with the facts. <br /> <br />(Oh, and by the way, although most Muslims are indeed not terrorists, imagine this: suppose 9/11 had been perpetrated by Mother Teresa's nuns.  We'd never hear the end of all the Catholic apologies.  Catholics would be heading up all the relief efforts, would be coordinating anti-terrorist seminars, going after Catholics who teach terrorism, etc.  The response would be swift and systematic.  In the Muslim world, on the other hand, we get the occasional muted protest -- with the notable recent exception of the Lebanese -- that is always hedged by qualifying phrases and excuse-making.  Why are we permitted to draw no conclusion from this?)
B000002UJQ|5.0|When i first thought of radiohead i thought of a group i wouldnt normally listen too. But after hearing OK Computer in full i realized i had been missing out on a lot. This album all the way through except for maybe fitter happier because that will get annoying is very enjoyable and mind pleasing. Its not the normal music u would hear on the radio now i mean i dont even think any of the songs have chours' that it self is not the norm but trust me if u give this album a chance like i did u will not be sorry and maybe it will open your mind to some new and different kind of music hope u enjoy
B0006399FS|5.0|Wow, U2 are 25 years old, and look at the album they have released. It sounds as if they are only starting out again with new ideas and a new lease on life. People can criticize Bono's voice, the fact that the CD 'apparently' sounds like All That You Can't Leave Behind Part II but this CD just emphasises the depth that U2 have in their music and their ability to \\"think it all up again\\". If your a U2 purist you'll love this CD as it, again, molds the band into one that sings about world issues, much like in the October and War days. If you are just a casual fan this is a great opportunity to listen and learn from the greatest band in the world.

0064431789|5.0|Where the Wild Things Are, by Maurice Sendak, was first introduced to me in my children's literature class.  I was hooked just from the title because it sounded so intriging.  This is a book that all children will enjoy.  Max gets sent to his room for misbehaving and in his room his imagination takes over.  Sendak expresses children's broad imgination and shows that their is a real purpose to it.  Max is able to escape his punishment by making beleive he travels to a land where he is king of all wild things.  In this place he gets to make the rules unlike his situation at home.  Most children dream of having this power to go whereever they want and do what they please. This book takes that dream and makes it a reality for children.  Eventhough they can not escape Max did escape and he returned home safely.  Children will relate to Max's situation and will feel pride in continuing to use their imaginations.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Batman has obtained cult status with all ages. And of course I am a fan of the big black bat and own all the other movies. <br /> <br />Actionwise this movie is fantastic. The special effects in the battles are very good. I have seldomly seen better. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that there are some changes in the storyline which have already been explained in the earlier episodes. I think that takes a lot of the realism away. For instance some parts of the beginning of batman have been changed, where little bruce see's his parents die, which was a main part of the movie with the Joker. But I don't want to kill the suspense. <br /> <br />I really think this movie is worth watching and I am glad that I got it. I definetly recommend it for any Batman fans.
0684833395|4.0|Joseph Heller does a great job in piecing together this story. Each anecdote acts as a new puzzle piece. As the story progresses the pieces start to fall into place to form the overall picture: a criticism on the aristocracy of war. <br /> <br />If you are into abstract stories that make your mind wonder what the author is truly trying to say, you will love this book. The writing style Heller presents is very unique. It leaves his readers split; you will either love it or hate it. The complexity of this text is better understood when reading it the second time through.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is a great disco/pop/great cd!  Great samples from 70's disco music.  I really hope that disco can be reborn with this cd and catches on!  This is for the people like me who were too young to grow up in the disco heavy 70's...maybe this is our chance!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Plainly stated, this is the best thing to come out of Madonna in a long while. With hints of what she's learned from 'Music' & 'Ray of Light,' Madonna takes her electronic euphoria to the next level in 'Confessions.' There are some cheesy lyrics, but like Madonna referenced, this album is to be fun, light and make her listeners feel buoyant. No doubt for the purpose of getting through the next two years of the current political climate. Everyone needs a vacation and this is the little mental escape her fans have been yearning for!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|WOW was my first reaction to the whole CD especially the non-stop album... each songs flows into one another to the very end at \\"Like it or not\\"... I was totally impress with how she sounds on this album... she may not have the best vocal cord in the world but God did BLESS HER WITH A VOICE that can change into many different tunes on every song she has ever recorded.  This album is a real BLOCKBUSTER.... got great disco feel to it and catchy tunes to dance to... some slow and more fast songs.  This is DEFINITELY one all fun political-free album everyone can enjoy.  I LOVED THIS IT AND PLAY IT NON-STOP!!!! MADONNA WILL ALWAYS BE THE QUEEN!!!!
B000B8QF14|3.0|not much to say about this other than the fact that it's full of annoying cuts where they go to backstage shots of the band talking about things...that would be okay if you weren't expecting a concert dvd.    Also the fact that songs are cut from the show..and a few songs are cut from the cd...adds up to failure for being an amazing product.    Might be a must have for any hardcore green day fan but I still don't own it and have essentially everything else they have put out. I don't have it because of the aforementioned sloppy job of piecing it together...
B0009A40ES|3.0|A cult-classic, American Psycho, is about a young, well-off young man, who loves himself almost as much as he loves killing.  Christian Bale (Batman Begins) plays a homicidal maniac so well that I seriously was stuck in the moment-by-moment details of this movie.  I stayed up all night just imagining the scene where blood splattered against his face as he killed one of his victims.  This movie really shows the sickness that can be under a seemingly \\"normal person.\\"  Wealth means nothing, beauty means nothing....your co-worker could be a murderer.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Many an Opeth fan likely has had mixed feelings about the directions the band has taken in the time and events leading up to this album.  After their 2003 album _Damnation_, many had thought that Opeth had \\"gone soft\\" (a great misunderstanding, as the band had originally planned on releasing _Damnation_ along with its predecessor, the ultra-heavy _Deliverance_, as a two-disc album of two wholly contrasting songs).  What's more, they ended up leaving their longtime record label Koch to join the far more mainstream label Roadrunner.  And if that wasn't enough, Opeth hired a fifth full-time member - a keyboardist!  What all these things could amount to, nobody was sure.  Ultimately, however, these changes were for the best; on August 30th this year, Opeth released what may well be their best and most varied work to date. <br /> <br />On _Ghost Reveries_, Opeth's musical style may at first appear to be the same as they've always composed: ultra-heavy riffs and death metal vocals, as well as mellow, acoustic/clean electric guitar and tender vocals, all within the same song.  However, there are several differences on this album, some subtle, and others more obvious.  For one thing, there are actually more clean vocals on this album than any of their previous (heavy) records - again, this is not to say that Opeth have \\"gone soft.\\" <br /> <br />Opeth had recently been incorporating keyboard sounds and styles into their music more and more (a big influence of the producer of their past three albums, Porcupine Tree leader Steve Wilson); the arrival of Per Wiberg into Opeth's lineup made for a perfect opportunity to further explore this new style.  A former touring member for Opeth as well as studio/touring member of Spiritual Beggars and Arch Enemy, Mr. Wiberg is no stranger to keyboard-metal fusion.  A few highlights include the beautiful harmonies in the choruses of \\"Isolation Years,\\" the atmospheric background harmonies and excellent piano melodies in \\"Atonement,\\" and thebrilliant, swirling sounds and textures in the outro to \\"Beneath the Mire.\\" <br /> <br />Even with the various new directions explored, _Ghost Reveries_ is still distinctly recognizable being Opeth.  The melodic metal stylings, the emotional vocals, the acoustic breaks - it's all here.  Songs such as \\"The Baying of the Hounds,\\" \\"Beneath the Mire,\\" and \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" could have (more or less) been on _Blackwater Park_ or _Deliverance_; there are a couple of ballads (the aforementioned \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Isolation Years\\"), and there's even a short instrumental (immediately following \\"Atonement\\" on the same track) comprised of clean electric guitar strumming and keyboard harmonies. <br /> <br />The rest of the band is in great shape.  Mikael's switching up his death metal voice a bit more (using the higher, raspier tones of such early albums as _Orchid_ and _Morningrise_ as much as the deepest growls of _Blackwater Park_ and _Deliverance_), and his singing voice has not been more crisp.  The guitar styles from Peter Lindgren and Mikael are naturally in top form (distorted and clean electric, and of course acoustic) as they continue to weave beautiful harmonies with ultra-heavy riffs with brilliant ease.  Martin Mendez has usually followed the traditional path as a metal bassist (i.e. generally being lost in the heaviness), but on _Ghost Reveries_, his bass lines are actually quite audible most of the time for a change (likely due to the band's self-production).  And let's not forget Martin Lopez behind the rhythm section, skillfully adding the right bone structure to each song with his versatile and highly distinct playing styles, while adding some new touches (most notably the conga beats switching up with a more jazz-oriented percussion on \\"Atonement\\"). <br /> <br />The entire album is worth a listen, and as a whole, it is simply a masterpiece.  However, there is one song which is a particular standout which deserves a large amount of attention on its own, and that is the dark epic \\"The Grand Conjuration.\\"  The song is largely driven by the same harmony, played alternately in faster and slower tempos (over which Mikael's growl sounds more monstrous than ever).  It's during the verses where the true power of this song lurks; the main harmony is played in a slow, absolutely menacing series of riffs, with Mikael's singing voice low and distinctly cold as he recites a chant to a dark deity.  The song starts off dark, but it gets even darker, reaching into the blackest voids of infinity with a harrowing display of evocative songwriting, touching on the twisted center of evil in such a simple series of keyboard and guitar notes.  This might not make a lot of sense in any kind of description; rather, it takes only a listen to make one understand the quiet, brooding menace of this song. <br /> <br />There's not much more that can really be said about this album, simply because it leaves the listener speechless with awe.  With such brave exploration and originality on this album, more so than ever before, Opeth have created what is likely THE progressive metal album of 2005.  Going beyond anyone's expectations and even beyond any of their own previous excursions into progressive music, _Ghost Reveries_ is, without a doubt, Opeth's finest and best album to date, and simply put, a masterpiece.
B00006RINF|4.0|If you havn't heard of this album yet, you're out of the loop and you need to buy it (just joking).  Seriously though, Comalies is the album by the Goth-Metal band Lacuna Coil, that really got them known and famous.  Featuring the most popular songs \\"Heavens A Lie\\" and \\"Swamped\\", Lacuna Coil proves that Italy has some really talented musicians.  Christina Scabbia (lead singer) has a definate angelic voice that, although many times compared to Amy Lee's from Evanescence, is one of a kind and captures you.  Andrea (male vocalist) also brings something special to the mix, his voice is very deep and angsty sounding, yet powerful at the same time.  The pair does coompliment eachother, however, Christina goes above and beyond when comparing the two.  Great album, check out their earlier ones as well!
B00005J6T1|5.0|Look at that face,man. I am in love with Madonna. She is the sexiest of all the stars EVER! She still is too.<br />Back in the days when I had a small time garage band, we played a gig doing strait up Madonna songs as a tribute to this kitten. I think we started here with HOLIDAY and LUCKY STAR. These are the obvious hits, but now that I think about it maybe we should have covered BURNIN UP or even BORDERLINE. These songs are pretty solid too.<br />Madonna is a bad ass, no matter how poppish the songs get, you can't help but like them.<br />This album IS a little bit dated, and she still sounds very young- compared to the later more assertive sound that her voice obtained. Still, if you a are a fan, you will dig these songs.
B000AP04L0|5.0|A bored, badgered employee (Ron Livingston) at a run-of-the-mill tech company is accidentally hypnotized into blowing off his job, just as two of his co-worker friends are about to get laid off. His carefree attitude helps him woo a sexy, disgruntled waitress (Jennifer Aniston), and he and his friends hatch a plan to plant a computer virus that sends fractions of pennies from the company's transactions into a secret bank account. <br />You have to get this special edition if you love Office Space.  Special features and laughter all the way....
B000803PKY|5.0|The reviewer who writes: \\"the music is great, but the DVD is nothing more than a collection of pictures...\\" fails to understand the concept of a DVD-Audio disc.  Along with that \\"collection of pictures\\", there is a high resolution 192kHz 24-bit stereo track and a brand new 96kHz surround mix.  Each of those alone is worth the price of admission.
B00005JNJV|5.0|To date, this is the best Matman movie yet.  I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive since the Batman movies of the past seemed plain out cheesy, however, Batman Begins proved to be the exact opposite or it's predecessors.  Starring Christian Bale, Batman Begins is more \\"true-to-life\\" than the one's of the past and emits a dark, goth, atmosphere.  More Underworld-like (the movie).  You have to see this for yourself.
020530902X|4.0|Small, easy to carry around and flip through. Short and too the point. It's one of the books on my shelf I forget about. I end up searching high and low for an answer before I remember I have this little devil and within its pages is usually the answer I've been looking for the whole time. It's a required reference book for any writer.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Snatch is a movie in which the plot circles around a stolen diamond that everyone is trying to get ahold of.  Featuring a conglomeration of ultimately crazy characters, Snatch is a mix of fun thiefery.  Brad Pitt truly plays his part well as an Irish gypsy that you just can hardly understand as he mumbles about his mother whom he would kill for.  Two men, Turkish and Tommy, are forced into getting Brad Pitt's character to do some underground fighting that leads them all into a dark world.  Amidst, the very satirical mayhem, you will find Benicio DelToro playing \\"Franky Four Fingers,\\" a man with...well...four fingers and a brief case handcuffed to his wrist....Rade Serbedzija as \\"Boris the Blade,\\" a ruthless killer, and Robbie Gee as Vincent, a really bad criminal that finds himself and his friends in a lot of trouble throughout the movie. <br /> <br />So if you like comedy,criminals,murderers,mayhem,satire,cruelty, and fighting...this movie is for you!
B00005JNJV|4.0|We enjoyed this new instalment telling the story of Batman's creation. This episode was more about story than action and special effects although what was there was great to watch.<br /><br />This episode was lighter on the comic relief and more on the story. In the beginning Liam Neeson (who plays a pseudo mentor for Christian Bale) reminded me a lot of his Star Wars character. Michael Caine was excellent as the caring chaperone butler but I expected him to go into his \\"Kings of England\\" speech a few times. Katie Holmes was her cute little self but nothing to write home about. Morgan Freeman had a wee role. All the supporting characters have had better roles but it was fun to see them as supporting cast. And they really do support Christian without stealing the spotlight.<br /><br />This is a splashy role for Christian but he was hot. This was a huge difference from the Machinist which I've seen recently (definitely watch it to see the physical sacrifice this actor goes through). He was enjoyable and believable as the dark Bruce searching for a purpose and societal role.<br /><br />We enjoyed seeing the creation of Batman's gadgets: the car, the belt, the suit etc. My husband didn't like the car though. My only disappointment? Absolutely no features. Excellent movie.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is a must-see movie.  It all plays out like a comic book, and the special effects are hypnotizing and artistic as hell.  Along the way we meet hookers,mobsters,police offers (good and bad),strippers, and heroes.  A great cast including Benicio DelToro,Bruce Willis,Britney Murphy,Rosario Dawson,Jessica Alba, and many more.  Truly a masterpiece.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is really an amazing book. Heller opens with many random character descriptions and stories. Within the first few chapters it is easy to feel confused and/or lost. As the book continues, everything that was once confusing starts making sense and the book becomes rather interesting. This is where Heller puts the icing on the cake. Everything starts connecting with each other and the whole book becomes a masterpiece.  <br />Heller also constructs different feelings and views on war and the effect of it. If you are in the mood for an exciting, mind boggling, and action packed book, I suggest Catch-22!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Underworld is a beautifully crafted movie about Selene (a vampire) who tries to help a human that the Lycans (wherewolves) are after...all while trying to find out many unanswered questions....why do they want him...has one of their own betrayed them?  She finds herself liking him and goes on to help him even though it's forbidden to do so.  She soon learns that her human, Michael, is someone very special...This all happens while a war between vampires and wherewolves are going on.  The uncut version includes a sexual scene that was cut out of the movie, just for your information. I highly reccomend it...look for Underworld: Evolution...coming to theaters soon as well!!!!
B000001FTQ|4.0|Wide Awake in America is an EP released after U2's career-defining appearance at 1985's Live Aid.  It consists of live performances of \\"Bad\\" (NOT the version from Live Aid) and \\"A Sort of Homecoming,\\" both from 1984's The Unforgettable Fire, as well as two outtakes from that album, \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" and \\"The Three Sunrises.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bad\\" was recorded in November of 1984 in Birmingham, England (not in the U.S. as the EP's title suggests), well before Live Aid.  This version of the song is absolutely amazing- it's infused with all the passion of the studio version as well as the energy from the audience.  \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" was recorded at London's Wembley Arena several days later as a soundcheck- the audience noise was edited in later.  While knowing that somewhat dampens my enjoyment of the track, I still must say that it's performed with great energy and enthusiasm that were less present on the studio version.<br /><br />The two studio tracks are quite good, and I agree with the other reviewers that say that they belong on The Unforgettable Fire in place of some of the questionable material from that album (\\"Elvis Presley & America\\" in particular).  \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" is a slower, brooding piece not unlike \\"Bad\\" or the title track from The Unforgettable Fire.  \\"The Three Sunrises\\" is more joyous and uptempo, and has a sing-along feel to it.  These are two of the best U2 B-sides.<br /><br />Wide Awake in America is a fantastic EP and something that I'd recommend to anyone interested in U2.  However, there's the matter of this being an EP that's sold at an LP's price.  Myself, I downloaded the whole album from iTunes for $4.  That's probably the best way to go with this.
0553801503|4.0|Martin's new Feast is pretty slim pickings, and its no surprise. For those of us who have been following the series it should be obvious that this book would be the weakest in the series. George Martin originally tried to skip over this period in his story, but found he couldn't make it work. He came back to this part to fill it in, but ended up writing so much that his publisher wouldn't publish it as one volume. To keep the story coherent he decided to cut out half the characters instead of half the story. This book is in essence half of a new exposition for the third act. <br /> <br />So its no surprise then that Feast does not deliver like the other books. The conflicts that drove the first three have ground to a halt, and the characters who are doing exciting things are cut out of this installment. For now the story, like the kingdom of Westeros, has had all the fight beaten out of it. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this is George Martin, and his writing style and uniquely realistic fantasy are back. Arya and Sam break out of the monotony with exciting and revealing chapters (easily the best in the book), and Jaime continues his transformative character arc. The book suffers from its place in the series structure and the publishers' pocketbooks, but it is still recognizable as a product of one of fanstasy's modern masters.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I bought this dvd for my son. He loved it and so did I. <br /> It's a great movie.
0679731369|4.0|This very charming and lively study of the life and work of Gustave Flaubert poses an interesting question: would you rather read a book about a subject matter that completely mirrors reality or a book that takes some license with the truth for the sake of art?  The narrator of _Flaubert's Parrot_, Dr. Braithwaite, a Flaubert afficianado, delves into the master's literature and into his personal background, and comes up with various sets of facts depending upon the point of view of the source.  Mr. Barnes quotes Louise Colet, a poet and Flaubert's mistress, Flaubert's friends, as well as citing from Flaubert's masterpiece, _Madame Bovary_.  Mr. Barnes also presents the reader with two alternate chronologies of Flaubert's life, one idyllic and the other providing quite the opposite impression.    What I found particularly delightful about this book was the narrator's discussion of the parrot in Flaubert's novella, _A Simple Heart_.  Braithwaite compares the colors of the alleged real stuffed parrot, supposedly acting as Flaubert's muse while  writing _A Simple Heart_, with the parrot's description in the novella.  There is even some doubt that the bird-muse that Braithwaite temporarily has in his possession was in actuality Flaubert's.  Braithwaite also quotes from a Flaubert critic who chastizes Flaubert for his consistent inaccuracy in stating the color of Emma Bovary's eyes, rather than concerning herself with the novel's artistic merits.    _Flaubert's Parrot_ also concerns itself with Braithwaite's sad personal life, which may help explain some of his interest in Flaubert's romantic entanglements.  This helps to lend this book a multi-faceted flavor. That, together with its rich detail and its unique take on art and its critics, makes _Flaubert's Parrot_ an unusually holding work.
1573301051|5.0|I just can't understand why everybody tries to run down Mariah, Celine and the rest of these singers. Why can't you just accept that everyone of them is a brilliant singer and that it just depends on one's personal taste whether one prefers one singer over the other. I Myself like Mariah best and it's ridiculous to hear a voice student say that Mariah has lost her voice: her voice has always sounded like this, perhaps you should listen to mtv unplugged! Or has she lost her voice even before mtv unplugged? Apart from that a voice doesn't have to be clear in order to be a nice/good voice: Or would you say Tina Turner can't sing just because her voice is not as clear as Celine's??  <br />I really enjoyed listening to this music and I can recommend this product to everyone who loves real music!!
B00097DX3U|2.0|i'm want to get things straight i'm a huge soundgarden fan loved all there albums they did badmotor finger being my favorite and i loved chris cornell's one and only solo album   also i like about 5 tracks from audioslave's first album it wasn't a classic but how could it stand up against previous band efforts either by garden or the rage it couldn't and it got luke warm reviews from critics   now for their second album out of exile which i've just finally purchased because it was going quite cheap and heard it was a great album with audioslave finally getting their sound together     now i've just put this cd in my player and was blown away out how much it sucks...it's a mediocre album with just stupid weird solo's   and cornella lyrics don't hold up much to his previous efforts   just out of the rhyming dictornary...  the singles released from this album are the best songs so don't wate your money on the album like i did get the singles and save yourself some money   to buy any of this supergroup best effort go be yourself that's all you have to do
6304711891|5.0|One of the must have movies of recent times.  Sean Connery, Nick Cage, and Ed Harris on Alcatraz with VX gas...what more could you need?  I love the scene when Cage corrects the FBI agent by saying \\"that's chemical superfreak.\\"  Great car chase scene from the Fairmont hotel with Connery in a Hummer, Cage in a Ferrari, and the cable car.  If it's not in your DVD collection, it ought to be!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I have Powerslave, Number of the Beast, and Piece of Mind. I just recently got Brave New World. Maybe I'm crazy, but Brave New World is my favorite so far. This CD is very epic and large sounding. I can sink into it and be absorbed by its sound. It has a bit of everything, Number of the Beast style rockers and then it has progressive songs such as songs off of Somewhere In Time and 7th Son. The first half of the disc has \\"shorter\\" rockers(if you consider 6 minutes short). The second half has the big epics. These are all great. The instrumental sections of these songs are hair raising as well. I'm going to give a song by song review of the album <br /> <br />Song-By-Song Review: <br /> <br />1. The Wicker Man (10/10)- I hear this is the big hit off the CD. I can see why, the chorus is amazingly catchy. There is an extremely addictive little melody, and the double bass drums sound good during the chorus. Another great Maiden opener that stands tall with the other Maiden openers. One of the poppier songs, but one of the best. <br /> <br />2. Ghost of Navigators (9/10)- This song has everything and a great prog rocker. Its fast, heavy, and has great time changes leading to the chorus.  <br /> <br />3. Brave New World (10/10)- Of the first 5 tracks this one is my favorite. It begins melodic and builds up to the great chorus. This contains some of the best solo's and harmonies I've ever heard. <br /> <br />4. Blood Brothers (8/10)- This is a longer song at 7 minutes. It also has lots of clean guitar parts. It builds into another great chorus. Brucey shines here. I give it 8 because it can get slightly tedious. Definitely not one to skip, this has great instrumental sections and solos. <br /> <br />5. The Mercenary (10/10)- Another classic here. Contains my favorite solo. Nice harmonies, and the chorus is so huge sounding. The chorus is repeated many, many times but it is so good you won't notice or care. <br /> <br />6. Dream of Mirrors (7/10)- Maybe I am impatient, but this song takes a little too long to get to its climax. I never skip it, but I have to focus to keep from zoning out. At 9 minutes, this is one of the longer songs. <br /> <br />7. The Fallen Angel (10/10)- This one is like the Wicker Man, its one of the shortest songs at 4 minutes and also one of the catchiest and best. The solo's and chorus are great.  <br /> <br />8. Nomad (11/10)- This song is another of the epics. Its nine minutes(or eight?) of epic music with an Arabian feeling to it. Bruce's vocals are godly here. What makes this song the best song of the album(along with the last track), is the amazing section in the middle that lasts for a few minutes. At first listen it might seem a little dragged out, but actually listen to it and close your eyes...amazing. <br /> <br />9. Out of the Silent Planet (9/10)- What a surprise, another great song. I love the chorus(is there one weak chorus on this whole album?). The song in my opinion should have been placed before Nomad, that way have Nomad and The Thin Line would be consecutive to each other. <br /> <br />10. The Thin Line Between Love and Hate (11/10)- I could get sacrficed for this, but I like this even more than Hallowed Be Thy Name...yes it's that good. It's 9 minutes long and still too short. Contains great verses, choruses, harmonies, and the ending part where Bruce sings, \\"The Thin Line between Love and Hate\\" with the clean guitars is amazing. This song has Bruce's best vocals. <br /> <br />Overall: <br />This is my favorite of the 4 Maiden CD's I have because I find no weak tracks at all. As great as those earlier ones are, I found some weak spots or tracks I would skip. Piece had Quest For Fire, and Number has Gangland. I love this progressive sound that Iron Maiden uses. I definitely want to get 7th son and Somewhere In Time as they are probably even better albums. If you want emotional, epic, and skilled music buy this. I promise you will enjoy this.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|this is really a great cd by P!ATD that brings a flare to rock not seen by many bands.  P!ATD isnt a normal rock band and they infuse many different genres into their music.  Overall, a very good album. <br /> <br />1. Introduction - n/a <br />2. Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage - 9/10 - a very good beginning to the cd that has pretty good lyrics and a good rhythm. <br />3. London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines - 10/10 - in my opinion, one of the best on the album.  lyrics are the best part of the song.  make us it, make us hip, make us scene. <br />4. Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks - 7.5/10 - a pretty good song, but definitely not one of their best <br />5. Camisado - 8.5/10 - very catchy and as always very catchy lyrics. <br />6. Time to Dance - 10/10 - In my opinion, the best song on the entire album. <br />7. Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off - 9.5/10 - not the best one on the album, but a very catchy tune <br />8. Intermission - n/a <br />9. But It's Better If You Do - 7.5/10 - Isn't that good of a song, but is not that bad.  Just dont care for it <br />10. I Write Sins Not Tragedies - 9/10 - a very good song and has a good beat.  a bit repetitive. <br />11. I Constantly Thank God for Esteban - 6/10 - THE worst song on the album.  Should not have put it on the cd. <br />12. There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't - 6.5/10 - Not much better than number 11, and also should not have included on album <br />13. Build God, Then We'll Talk - 10/10 - a very good closing to the album and very addicting.  Once again, very original lyrics <br /> <br />Overall, this album has very very good songs that outweigh the bad ones to give it a five star rating.  P!ATD is one of the most original bands and has some of the best lyrics of the rock world, heck, the music world.
0553801503|2.0|<br />I'm one of the ones who pre-ordered this book and waited impatiently through the recurring delays for the release of this book. I had high hopes that Martin would not sucker his fans into having to buy yet another book after this one to get to the end of this story. This seems to be the trend with fantasy authors these days, and frankly, I'm getting fed up with it. This book needed some heavy editing, and if it had been edited, maybe yet another book would not have been necessary. I was very taken with Martin's writing style in the first three books, and I found it refreshingly different, but when it's strung out, it can be excruciatingly boring. I will not pre-order the next book, but will wait for good reviews before buying. Caveat emptor!

B000BGH22W|4.0|There is always a certain amount of anticipation and dread when a new composer takes over for a well known composer in a major film series.  Just look at the various responses here along with this review.  Sometimes the dread is well placed; note what horrible things followed when Bill Conti and Marvin Hamlisch took over for John Barry in the James Bond series.  Fear not with Patrick Doyle's score for the fourth Harry Potter entry, \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\\"  From the first notes of \\"The Story Continues\\" Doyle's music dispells any worries, and pulls you into the  magical world of Hogwarts.  Interweaving obligatory main themes by the great John Williams, and developing his own themes and motifs, Doyle has put together music that goes beyond just \\"serviceable.\\"  Indeed, in places it's \\"bloody  brilliant.\\"  Menacing, majestic, mysterious, heroic, even romantic and amusing, Patrick Doyle hits all the right notes; even \\"Neville's Waltz\\" and \\"Potter's Waltz\\" come off well.  Certainly, Williams is missed, but this is a very capable, and enjoyable score that should not be underestimated. The soundtrack recording is nicely produced and packaged by Warners Sunset/Warner Brtothers, but some may be put off by the songs tacked on as the final three cuts (other vocals such as those in \\"Underwater Secrets,\\" on the other hand, work very well).  Welcome to Hogwarts Mr. Doyle!  <br />

Have you woken up to find that all the laces of your shoes are tied together and that your dog has a large bald spot on its head? If you answered \\"yes\\" to any or all of these questions, then there can be no doubt that you have a member of the faerie world living in your home. Is it a boggart, a brownie, or a knocker? What do these mysterious creatures look like?    Within the pages of this remarkable guide you will find the answers to these and many other questions. Without a doubt this is one of the most comprehensive and fascinating books of its kind. Co-authors Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi have taken pages from Arthur Spiderwick's famous Guide and used them to create a book that is beautiful to look at and full of valuable and useful information. Where else will you learn how to stay on the right side of a brownie, and how else will you know that the gargoyles you see on buildings may in fact be alive?    Packed with luscious color illustrations and numerous pencil sketches, this book is a must for fans of The Spiderwick Chronicles. Readers of all ages will get lost in the pages (some of which fold out to reveal beautiful illustrations) and in no time will be convinced that they indeed are looking at the life's work of Arthur Spiderwick, which thankfully has been reproduced here by the talented duo of Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi.       --- Reviewed by Marya Jansen-Gruber, editor of Through The Looking Glass Children's Book Review ([...])  [...]
B00097DXZS|1.0|Turns out that Sony has copy protection on their CD's that can cripple your computer, let it reboot by remote request, download and install any software from any website without your permission and changes its own security rights to bypass any you have set. <br /> <br />Ok, all that stinks for the honest people. <br /> <br />However, if you are a pirate this is super since this Sony software can EASILY hide any of their copying programs from detection. So, Sony managed to empower the pirates to the point they can't be found at all, while completely obliterating the privacy and security of their PAYING CUSTOMERS. Nice combo meal. <br /> <br />How is that for irony? The pirates love that Sony software since they can use it to steal this CD (and others).

The key is being able to relate to the lyrics, you probably need a couple under your belt to really get songs like the fantastic 'walk on by' on an emotional level, and some crappy job experience to understand 'you turn the screws'.<br /><br />Though it may not have the pop hooks of fasion nugget it stands alone as a remarkable accomplishment.

B000A6T1KE|5.0|A righteous infliction of retribution, manifested by an appropriate agent. An opponent that cannot be beaten or overcome. One that inflicts retribution or vengeance.  <br />Keep this in mind when you watch this movie and see how many different ways the Nemesis theme comes across or carried through. The Nemesis theme is almost overwhelming from the start but if we pay attention one can find beleifs and values that transcend all adversity providing hope for the future. This movie does not attempt to do more than what a movie is capable of providing.  <br />Movies are comprised of 5 stars. Have them all and you have a 5 star movie.  <br />1)Does the movie tell story? <br />2)Is the story easy to follow within the movie? <br />3)Was the director effective in telling of this story?  <br />4)Did the movie accomplish this in the allotted time frame? <br />5)Did the audience leave the movie talking about the story they just experinced? If the answer is 'yes' to all 5 of these ?'s - the Movie is 5 STAR.  <br />Nemesis is five star becouse it accomplishes all of these things. <br />Word of Caution: If you have your \\"cool\\" card in your wallet...this movie is sure to disappoint and if you are expecting this movie to be anything like the televison series, again it will sadly disappoint. Now, if we take out the cool cards, view with minds open - Nemesis is complex, exciting, and has all the elements of the previous nine Trek big screen releases plus the movie-making technology of today. If we look back to the previous movies they also had little in common with the TV series other than the familiar names and faces along with Star Fleet terminology. A well-done movie provides entertainment value regardless of prior exposure to the subject matter. Nemesis can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of previous Star Trek exposure.
B000002I4W|5.0|1959 was probably the biggest year for jazz in history. Out of that year we were introduced to instant classics such as \\"Kind of Blue\\", \\"Giant Steps\\", \\"Time Out\\", \\"Mingus Ah Um\\" and of course, Ornette Colemans \\"Shape of Jazz to Come.\\" It is not surprising Coleman's release was originally criticized by many as the red-headed step child of jazz music. Many were outraged by Coleman's tunes that lacked an explicit form or set of chord changes. However, much of what we listen to now in the contemporary world of jazz has been shaped by this important artistic album.<br /><br />If one listens to many of the groups that are on the contemporary scene these days such as the Dave Holland Quintet, it is very hard to discern any type of particular form or distinct chord changes that the players are improvising over. The reason you can't tell very easily is because well, there isn't one. We have Ornette Coleman to thank for this innovative concept that has created an entirely different world of jazz for us to enjoy. Many of the contemporary groups today have extracted much from the avant garde concepts that Coleman initiated on this record.<br /><br />One might be curious, how in the world can players improvise when there is no explicit form or chordal structure? The answer lies in one word: chemistry. The interplay between Charlie Haden (bass) and Billy Higgins (drums) with the soloists (Coleman on sax and Don Cherry on coronet) is amazing. The players are always conscious of what the others are doing at any given second. Because the chemistry between the players is so well-developed, the music has bite, edge and a sort of abrasiveness that rarely if ever sounds racous, out of tune or unmusical. Granted it is abstract and unconventional, but it stays away from being so vaporous that it cannot be comprehended by the untrained ear (an issue that some contemporary musicians err on too much).<br /><br />The only warning that I have about this album is that it is not intended to be background music of any kind. You can turn on Kind of Blue or Time Out and occupy yourself with something else and be just fine. This is not the case with \\"Shape of Jazz to Come.\\" Coleman's disc requires a much more attentive and engaged ear to really appreciate it. Many of the people who refer to this album as incoherent abstract garbage probably are not listening to the album the way it was meant to be listened to. Listen closely and you too, may truely appreciate the shape that jazz has taken.o be background music of any kind.

B000005JA8|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. I am completely unschooled in music theory, and although I listen to a good deal of the composers to whom Beefheart is compared, I don't pretend to understand what makes them great. <br /> <br />With that said, it strikes me as obvious and undeniable that Trout Mask Replica is a work of art. Everything I find bland and predictable in contemporary and \\"classic\\" rock and roll is simply absent in Beefheart's music. His songs lack repetitive, cyclical choruses and verses. His vocal range is astonishing. Rather than paying a guy to tap out the same 4:4 drum beat for 3 and a half minutes, his (often spastic) rhythms are consistently kept with creative, engaging drum fills.  All the instruments meander in directions that are both complementary and completely at odds with each other.  <br /> <br />More importantly, and on this I stand in direct opposition to any negative reviews that this album has received, most of the songs sound good. I really love the song Ella Guru. Pachuco Cadaver is genuinely fun to listen to. In Hobo Chang Ba, after all the instruments go around for a while and finally come back together in the end, the vocals add an entirely new dimension to the melody, and it's just brutal as hell.  <br /> <br />In summation, I really didn't notice how boring most of the music I listened to was until after hearing this record. Go buy this at a record store and avoid fueling the fire of amazonian corporate greed.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|As far as I am concerned, this boxed set is at the higher-end of mediocre spectrum.    In the show, The Ancients, the builders of the stargates and ancestor of modern humans left in a city-ship called Atlantis to the Pegasus galaxy and never returned.  10 million years later, an international team of scientists and military go on a one-way trip to Pegasus and discover the city underpowered, underwater, unihabited and hidden from Pegasus' version of thte Goa'uld: The Wraith.    PROS: The interior design and cover art is pretty good (in contrast to the box cover).  There are 4 episodes per disc, and each one is in 1.78:1 aspect ratio; the episodes themselves are 1.5-1.6GB in size, the same size as the disappointing MACGYVER boxed set episodes, but definitely better.  The sound, image, color and transfer is crisp, clean, smooth and polished with pixellation visible at 40X magnification.  Beautiful.  Audio commentaries on plenty of episodes even though I haven't listend to them all yet.    CONS: The cover box art is disappointing; I'd expect that design from overseas collections.  There are no bonus features aside from obligatory and sparse production documentation, so bloopers, deleted scenes and the like are out.    WORST: Forget about skipping through episodes to get to your favorite parts: THERE ARE NO CHAPTER STOPS PAST THE SHOWS INTRODUCTION; skip ahead from chapter 3 and you'll end up at the credits.    *NOTE* Reports about a Disc 5 glitch have been listed: allegedly, some sets may contain a Disc 5 that has Episodes 1-4 RE-printed on it instead of 17-20.  My set is fine, but you might want to look into this report.    These things and the final one especially stripped the 5th star from my review.    Other than that, this is one of the better spin-offs and this is definitely one of the better Season 1's you'll find (thanks to franchise budgets).  The quality of the image, compactness of the box and tone of story make this set worth the buy.
055358202X|1.0|This was self-indulgent crap.  Way too long.  Way too detailed (ok, he can make up like 1000 medieval sounding names, yay), and way too BORING.      And, the idea of splitting it by character not time was a disaster BEFORE he took multiple years of producing mini-nothing-works, and spending his time getting feted by fans at geek conventions.  Given the separation between the books, the character instead of time split is now Germany invades Russia level stupid.    Watching a great talent destroy itself like this in utter self-indulgent (Crows, and the waste of the last few years) is very sad.
B000A6T1HC|4.0|I am not a big Bartoli-Fan but I'm always intrigued by the oddities she digs up. And IMHO this is a clear winner among recitals. She sails through the difficult fioritura with flying flags while also giving drama & meaning to the text. One thing I do not like is the Bartoli-yelp in some of the fioritura. Her trill is also unsteady at times in slow pieces. But with arias as difficult as these it would be nipicky to harp on little flaws. Yes, Cecilia Bartoli has grown indeed and I hope that there'll be many more albums as good as this one.

B000059R8Y|3.0|Eric Clapton from time to time comes up with an album that is below his standard. I have to say This is subpar at best.  Clapton is in a mellow mood and it shows with songs like I Believe In Life and Dont Let Me Be Lonely tonight.  The songs on this album that are of note is the title track Reptile which sounds like something George Benson would do.  Clapton has not played much jazz in his career and I have to say I like the sound of this song.  Come Back Baby is a remake of the Ray Charles classic. This song alone is worth the price of the CD.  As a band memeber says when the song is finishing \\"Lord Have Mercy\\" This is one of Claptons finest blues songs he has ever recorded.  Sylvia and Son closes the album with an acoustic song that is very pretty.  Clapton from time to time does insturmentals such as Peaches and Diesel, this is another outstanding effort.  This CD is for Clapton collectors like me.

B00007E8V4|1.0|Well, I had to give it a one because it won't let me rate it as a zero or negative number. This band proves that you do not have to have musical talent to make a cd! There are maybe a couple of songs that are slow paced, but even they aren't very good. If you like fast paced music with nothing but screaming and yelling, then this album is for you. Otherwise my advice would be to operate several pieces of large equipment (such as saws, drills, sanders, etc.) for a more pleasant listening experience.
B000066F6H|5.0|Its been a while since a band like the Hives have been around. Bands liike the Stooges and the New York Dolls were bands that had the energy, the anger, and the talent to pioneer punk rock. Raw Power by the Stooges especially showed what a breakneck speed thrashing guitars, anthemic, though at times repetitive drum work, and a screeching voice can do. The Hives remind me so much of these great bands, and they certainly hold their own.  <br /> <br />This album is packed into a half hour, but after that short half hour, you will feel like you need to sit down somewhere and take a breather. The screaming, breaking vocals of Howlin' Pelle never ceases to amaze me. One reviewer stated that musically this album was amazing, but the voice was horrible. But in response to that, how many other singers could keep up with their music, and maintain the energy??  <br /> <br />This is such a fun album. Some of my favorites are the anti-capitlaist Die, Alright!, Main Offender, Hate to Say I Told You So, and The Hives Introduce the Metric System of Time. one thing to know about this album, not to stray from the quality of the album, is that it just might have been the Hives golden age. Their debut Barely Legal is faster, harder, and much sloppier. this approach has its appeal, but it isn't the amazing punk rock record that this is. Their followup to this album, Tyrannosaurus Hives, was good, but it seemed to have mellowed some. I guess most bands don't feel they can only put out continually crazy albums, and i am proud of them for experimenting with more serious forms of rock. but their specialities are seen here. so pick this up, and prepare to fall in love as you are rocked straight out of your socks! (heh heh sorry for the bad pun, it just seemed to fit!)
B000B8QEZG|2.0|When I first heard Madonna's single on the radio, I thought what is Abba getting back together? Did I miss something? HAHA.

But when 47 year olds start singing clubbing songs it makes me laugh....its like my 73yr old gramma hitting the club scene.  <br /> <br />There is nothing orginal about taking someone else's work and putting your own lyrics to it.

B00004U8JV|3.0|I'll start by saying that this is my \\"least\\" favorite of all the JP's, but still a very solid film. You get to see the raptors a bit more than the first, and the T-Rex, plus there are more people running around so it gives the adventure a little more depth. The main problem i have is that all the \\"great\\" or \\"once great\\" directors seem to have forgotten there roots and now rely on the directions of computer based gaphics instead of good ole fashion modeling, scaling, and actually working with costumes instead of CGI. Now i must say that this particular film doesn't rely half as much on CGI technologie as part 3, but everyone is \\"giving in\\" to the world of computers(myself included). Technology is actually becoming \\"scary\\" with all the new innovations such as Satellite Radio, DVD players for Cars(ok like there arent enough wrecks as there is?), Copy this Copy That, Cell phones for KIDS!! my god, what ever happened to using your imagination? <br /> <br />At any rate most movies such as these have lost there originality, and again the mighy \\"dollar\\" must be made in sequels that never match up to there predecessors. Star Wars is another good example of a movie that should have been left well enough alone. But instead George\\"show me the money\\" Lucas had to go back and use all this modern technology to \\"redo\\" the old films. As if they werent good enough by themselves? So everyone i think(especially Hollywood) should take a good look at all the money wasted on sequels and just the overall CRAP that we don't need to buy in our everyday lives. For example on the Lost World DVD there are so many features that if anyone has this much time on there hands to actually go through it all, i feel for them. Who the hell is gonna watch the \\"Entire\\" storyboard of the movie from beginning to end? And then again who the hell cares?? Back in the days when i was a kid(the 80's) movies were classic even though we didnt know it, lets bring back some of those shall we. Society in 2005 is nothing more than a totally self absorbed, make all the money while you can before you die bunch of morons that i have ever seen, and no not just because of a DVD, but the way they want to make everyone Lazy(No wonder half the US is Obese)(No offense to people with a medical condition). I'll bet most people don't even remember \\"getting up\\" to change the channel. The movie makers are no different they just want to make the movie, make there money back and enjoy there lives. Hense the reason very few classic movies are ever made anymore. Its a shame when you see people with no food, no homes, and ones who can't walk out of there houses for fear of getting shot, or blown up, while we live it up worrying about when the next big \\"trend\\" will hit. So think about this next time you watch another DVD, if thats all you have time for. And remember the good ole days of movies, when they really \\"mattered\\". Watch Lord Of The Rings, even though its a lot of CGI effects it has heart, and so does Peter Jackson. He makes Spielburg and Lucas look like Mr.Rogers. At any rate this movie is just another Hollywood adventure film that lacks what the first had, originality. And it gave me a chance to say some things i had to say. Adios:)
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When I got wind that Madonna was finally releasing some new material, initial reports were that it was going to be her \\"Rock album\\" a la Franz Ferdinand and Killers.  So wasn't I surprised to hear later reports that not only was she not going Rock, but that her new release was actually going to be a straight-up Dance album! <br /> <br />I was a little nervous about the whole thing after the somewhat disappointing Music and the tepid reaction to American Life.  Although I loved that album, despite it's #1 debut, it was clear the rest of the world was not in agreement (despite, again, the fact it includes seven, yes seven, Top 10 dance singles). <br /> <br />Maybe this is why she decided to get back to her roots, as they say, and give the people what they want.  An album to pop on to dance around the room and forget the world exists. <br /> <br />I certainly had no need to be worried. <br /> <br />Madonna has returned to the dance floor, and she has come back with a vengeance. <br /> <br />The album kicks starts in overdrive with the blistering ABBA-sampled lead-off single, \\"Hung Up,\\" her best single in years, and doesn't let up for the first nine songs of the album!  The album includes two of the best songs she has ever recorded, \\"Sorry\\" (rumoured to be the second single and the best mainstream dance track she has recorded since \\"Vogue\\") and \\"Forbidden Love\\" (not to be confused with the song of the same name from her Bedtime Stories album).  It also includes a song which is a wink at her very own \\"Holiday,\\" as \\"Get Together\\" is seemingly loosely based on the groove that threw Madonna onto the edge of superstardom twenty-two years ago. <br /> <br />Honestly, there are nine seriously strong tracks on this album of twelve.  Each one has it's own feel, it's own vibe, but each one with a killer beat. <br /> <br />I feel she lost her footing a little by putting the \\"spiritual\\" track \\"Isaac\\" on here.  It seems very ill-placed on the album and is definitely, by far, the weakest track on the album, but not nearly as big a blemish as \\"I'm So Stupid\\" was to American Life.  \\"Let it Will be\\" and \\"Like it or Not\\" (produced by Bloodshy & Avant, best known for producing Britney Spears' worst single, \\"Toxic\\"), although two sufficiently good songs, are forgettable in the long run in comparison to the other nine slammin' tracks.  The fact that nine of twelve are strong, however, is far more than most albums can say these days. <br /> <br />The album is made up of high-BPM, high-concept dance tracks, slowing only ever-so-slightly near the end for the RnB-tinged \\"Push\\" which will hopefully get a release or a remix somewhere down the road. <br /> <br />The album showcases some of the best production she has ever done and some very clever lyrics.  Stuart Price, musical director of her Re-Invention Tour, but best known for producing and remixing this years dance sensation Juliet, along with his numerous dance remixes of artists like No Doubt, Killers, FischerSpooner and his very own remix of Madonna's \\"Hollywood,\\" co-produced eleven of the tracks on this album with Madonna.  The man is absolutely brilliant and truly brought out the best material Madonna has recorded in ages. <br /> <br />The most notable downfall of this album is that it is continuous.  Each song mixes into each other, and that really is a downside for those, like me, who prefer to listen to albums on shuffle.  Here's hoping there is an eventual release with all the songs separated.  And take note that the limited edition, featuring one extra song entitled \\"Fighting Spirit,\\" will be in stores on December 13th, just in time for Christmas. <br /> <br />Believe me, just for that one song, I will be first in line. <br />
B00020HEG6|4.0|I generally think John Williams is a little overrated--great, no doubt, but overrated.  There are simply way too many great composers out there for one to get the spotlight this often.  In addition, I think that his inspiration has been running dry as of late--other than his Star Wars, Iniana Jones (pretty much all of his '80s work in addition) and Schindler's list scores--he's been getting a little flat as of late.  Not anymore.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great score. <br /> <br />Williams pretty much does away with Hedwig's theme most of the time, instead putting more emphasis on his new themes.  Those are: <br /> <br />A Window to the Past - This is one of the best themes Williams has ever composed.  Its representation on the album is a little short for someone like me who simply isn't satisfied with concert themes but rather integration of the theme into the rest of the score.  However, its power is undeniable. <br /> <br />Double Trouble - Not particularly great, but very effective in its contexts.  <br /> <br />Buckbeak's Theme - Another golden theme for a particular character scene from Williams. <br /> <br />The major problem with this soundrack is its arrangement on album--Williams sometimes has a problem with this.  In his best scores, he has concert arrangements of the major themes on album with the addition of lots of thematic development within the score.  Not so here.  \\"Double Trouble\\" is the only theme notably represented outside of its concert arrangement and \\"Finale,\\" and it works, but there's simply not enough coherence in the second half of the score.  Still, this stands as a wonderful achievement.
B000BGH22W|5.0|At first I did not like soundtrack at all. It has little to nothing form what John Williams created, and being a big fan of John Williams a was really mad. But I keep lesing to it and I stared to like it. The music sound better in the movie, and if you don't see the movie, you would probably think that this was not a Harry Potter soundtrack.
B000BGH22W|5.0|Unlike many, when I first heard that John Williams was replaced for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I didn't mind in the least.  The truth is that John Williams isn't as great as people make him out to be.  Don't get me wrong, he definitely is a great composer, but he gets the spotlight way too much, and other composers who are as good (if not better) but simply different get shoved to the side.  I enjoyed Williams' Potter scores, even if I didn't think they were as magical and coherent as they could have been (with the first two films I blame that on the director, and with the third I blame it on the album arrangement), but I still thought they were very good.  So I was very open-minded to hear what Patrick Doyle would bring us, having heard little of him but having loved what I heard.   <br /> <br />At first, this soundtrack struck me as a little flat.  After the second listen I decided that I had been temporarily deaf--this strikes gold in a way that Williams had never done.  Given, in a way, he was never given a chance to do this--Columbus was too cheesy, Cauron too subtle (but still brilliant) to really  work with this kind of material--but the fact remains that Doyle has crafted the first truly incredible large-budget accomplishment of his career. <br /> <br />The soundtrack, unlike the other three, moves chronologically through the film, and skips the attempt at concert suites.  For this reason, some may not pick up on the themes upon first listen.  I haven't seen the film so I can't say for sure, but I'll briefly outline what I believe to be the two major themes of this score: <br /> <br />Harry's Theme - Begins with a nice majestic treatment in \\"Foreign Visitors Arrive,\\" then moves through various modes:  a tender flute in \\"Harry Sees Dragons,\\" a bold, heroic statement at the end of \\"Golden Egg\\" and \\"The Black Lake,\\" and evolved into a tender love theme in \\"Harry In Winter.\\"   <br /> <br />Voldemort's Theme - Simple, but effective.  Its basically a sixnote ascending theme.  Its heard too many times to count, so I won't even try. <br /> <br />There are many other gorgeous themes, motifs, and rhythms in this score that makes it a very rich and complete listening experience.  The only detriment of the album is having the songs at the end.  I certainly think they will be appropriate for the Ball, but putting them at the end of the album kills the somber mood at the end, and in addition the lyrics are way too cheesy.  I'm not particularly fond of the style, either. <br /> <br />In the end, Doyle's score reigns supreme.  Here's to hoping he'll be kept for Order of the Phoenix in 2007.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is THE BEST rock album of all time. It never falls short to please the entire way through.  To quote one of my peers on here, this album seems like it had to come \\"from another planet\\".  It is so tight melodically that you can hardly believe your ears.  From the first bass lines of \\"Come Together\\" to McCartney's yearning, soulfull \\"Oh, Darling\\" to Harrisons \\"Something\\", and finally to the very fitting \\"The End\\" the album becomes something more than just music...it becomes an experience that everyone should know of, with a message found in every religion.  \\"And in the end, The love you take is equal to the love you make\\".  What you put into the world is what you will get out of it.  The Beatles gave something wonderful to the world here.  It is almost a sin to not have heard something so beautiful.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I bought this movie and had high expectations for it. ALthough I did not put it in my dvd player for about two days, I was happy when I did.  <br />The Story <br />Kadag, Loz and Yazoo are all searching for Jenova's lost head through cloud. They refer to CLoud as big brother.  <br />Kadag seems to be able to summon creatures called shadow creepers and a large behemoth called bathomet or something. The fight scenes are very impressive. Some of the best moments in the movie are with REno and Rude of the Turks. I was laughing real hard when they appear on screen. Their are little moments in the film that you'll have to watch for, like when Tifa is fighting Loz in the church and he is buried under some debris, his cell phone starts ringing. Listen real careful to his ring tone, although I'm sure you'll hear it anyway. <br />I bought the single edition, but I'm going to buy the Double disk edition if it ever comes out ino America. The two disk set is worth waiting for because it has an anime on it about when Cloud and Zac were traveling alone and when Septhiroth finds out that he is descended from Jenova. This movie is a must have for any Final Fantasy VII fan.

0385510454|1.0|Mr Grisham for an advertising travel guide about the secret corners, exotic avenues and dishes of Italy. I really appreciate your enthusiasism. I have plans now to visit that country...     But please next time do a little favour to us, your humble readers, and do not forget to add a story along the process. The Summons and King of Torts were half-lacking it but at least there was something that resembled a story among the entire jumble. But this atrocity takes the cake...One of the worst books released in 2005 and that says many things, given the fact that it was published very earlier this year, in January actually.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This has got to be one of Madonna's Greatest Albums Ever.  It is non-stop dance.  Lyrically the greatest album.  Just like the song say \\"This is who I am You can like it or not You can love me or leave me\\" Well I love Ya Girl. <br /> <br />
B000BGH22W|5.0|Yes! Thank you! Finally something I actually want to listen to! Not saying I didn't like John Williams rendition of Harry Potter but come on, it was getting a little old. i was very excited to hear something new! and i think Patrick Doyle really caught the feeling of the Goblet of Fire which is my favorite book of all the series. harry is growing up. this book is also the turning point of the series. things needed to change. less of the baby stuff and more of a mature harry potter( this film is rated pg-13 after all). my fingers are crossed for the movie. please let it be good. Once again i want to say Thank you Patrick Doyle!!! Hope to hear you again on the future harry potter soundtracks.
B00005JO1G|2.0|This movie proves to be a definite improvement over the book, only because the excessive sniveling have been limited due to the interest of the movie. If this' an one man's view of his experience in the Marine Corps, its a pretty sad one at that.<br /><br />In Swofford's experiences, the US Marine Corps proves to be nothing more then but pronographic loving, lewd mannered sniveling jarheads who survived Operation Desert Storm only because their Iraqi enemies were even more weaker then they were. But this is one man's view and he wasn't a very happy Marine for sure. It pretty hard to called this a \\"war movie\\" since it really wasn't much of a war. The self-inflicted stress and trauma these Marines on screen suffered from were home sickness, boredom, losing their girlfriends and wives to guys at home and lack of enemies to kill. I am sure that the veterans of Vietnam, World War II and Korea wishes their stress and trauma were that terrible as well.<br /><br />The movie overall, however, appears to be well produced, directed and acted. Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good job playing the main sniveler, Swofford. Swofford proves to be an interesting character because despite of all the whining he does on screen, he still tries to do his duty the best he can. Jaime Foxx also shine as well as Swofford's squad leader and the movie appears to be well supported by fine acting.<br /><br />However, if you watch...let say...Saving Private Ryan prior to watching this movie, you will probably feel a great deal of contempt toward the whining Marines of this movie. And if not, you will still feel like questioning if this is the ideal model of \\"the few and the proud\\" Marine Corps material. I hope not!
1591396190|4.0|Kim and Mauborgne present a compare and contrast analysis of Red Oceans (where most companies engage in bloody competition in a wide range of industries) vs Blue Ocean (where companies operate in new, uncontested waters).  The authors' description of Red Oceans is spot on - as they describe many industries with little real differentiation and the resulting intense competition.  Blue Oceans, on the other hand, offer the enticing prospect of clear differentiation, competitive advantage, and higher profit margins.  Although the framework, model and tools presented are interesting, it is not clear that the companies cited as operating in blue oceans actually went through anything resembling the strategic tools presented in order to create their \\"blue ocean\\" opportunities.  It is more of a post-hoc review.  That gripe notwithstanding, the book is worth a read, especially by those involved in strategic planning, market development, and new product development.
B00097DXZS|2.0|I'm glad I read the reviews here before putting this disc into my computer.  I've dealt with copy protection schemes on VHS, DVD, and computer software, and I have yet to see one that doesn't cause major technical glitches, to say the least.  However, what I'm reading here is going way beyond that.  Hopefully the backlash on this will be strong enough so that Sony and the other manufacturers will back off on this sort of nonsense.  (For details, see other reviews.)<br /><br />I doubt if Carlos Santana or any of his musicians are responsible for this.  I'd wager that the decision was made after the album was delivered and that Santana personally has no control over it.<br /><br />As for the record... this is another attempt to recapture the magic of Santana's big comeback hit, \\"Supernatural\\", and like its predecessor, \\"Shaman\\", it falls short.  There are some interesting songs, but it lacks that Spanish feel that made the diverse offerings of \\"Supernatural\\" fit together.  It's smooth and mostly enjoyable music, but nothing special.<br /><br />It's worthwhile for an old fogey like me, who grew up on Santana's earliest records, to get some exposure to newer performers, even if I'm only getting a taste.  \\"Supernatural\\" got me listening to Everlast, and I'm now a big fan.<br /><br />Note: I have an old stand-alone CD copying deck and had no problems burning a copy of this disc.  Perhaps CD-ROMs are so widely used that this type of deck is no longer being manufactured, but in any case the copy protection scheme is clearly doing more harm than good.  Based on what I've read here, I wouldn't take the chance of installing this on your computer.  Fortunately the album is not that great, so you can pass it up without missing too much.
0761119752|5.0|We received this book on my daughters 1st birthday.  She immediately loved it.  We sing the book to her as this book easily lends itself to song.  In the beginning we pointed to all of the different objects the text refers to: the moon, pink pajamas, blue pajamas and such.  After a few readings, she is now pointing to the objects as we sing the book to her.  She loves it, and it has made putting her down for bed such an ease.  We sing the book two times and then it time for \\"night-night.\\"  This book is heartily recommended.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I wonder how many of you !diots actually ran out to buy  \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\" I listened to it for free and I thanked my lucky stars for not spending one dime on it. I was hoping that this CD would be innovative and exciting, but it's just the same old boring Eurotechno pop she's being doing for the past 5 years. On 1995's \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" Madonna had a song  produced by Babyface called \\"Forbidden Love.\\" Why in the world does she have a song called \\"Forbidden Love\\" on 'Confessions'?  Don't be fooled- it's *not* the same song. Madonna has never been that great of a singer, but she was entertaining and somewhat creative. She basically doesn't have anything to offer people anymore and 'Confessions' is further proof of that.  Madonna should be retired by now, but she knows as long as she slaps together something quick there will be millions of poor souls buying it.  Conclusion: This CD is straight up wack and will clear a dancefloor in seconds. Skip this and get \\"The Immaculate Collection.\\"
B000002LLC|1.0|Even though I'm a GREAT Madonna fans, I have to say that this album DOES SUCK!!!! <br />I do not understand why Madonna has made it; it's totally cheesy!!! <br />Buy it just if you want to complete your Madonna collection and/or if you want the original version of Vogue (still her best dance song).
B000AGTPUA|5.0|Addressing the review Soulles Christmas. <br /> <br />Since when does a move (book, painting, poem etc.) need to have a universal theme? Certainly there are many who don't have Christmas as a cultural tradition, but certainly find other reasons to enjoy the company of family and friends in the spirit of giving at least once a year (well apparently some don't). How exceptionally dull this world would be without cultural distinctiveness anyway. Of course there are some inclined to force their views upon those around them with a sense of indignation toward the recipient. Have we not learned the folly in this yet?   <br /> <br />I don't see why some feel it is compulsory to view Christmas from the standpoint of capitalism (slaves and coca-cola, that descends to inventive level). Is it possible to realize that the central idea could be about giving (that should be universal)? Of course when someone finds it necessary to preface any gift giving they do with \\"You know how hard I had to work to buy you these things,\\" I prefer they keep the item and work a little less, they may realize that giving isn't really a sacrifice (you can actually feel good doing it - imagine that).  <br /> <br />Polar Express is simply I fun movie wrapped up in a Christmas theme. If Santa gets under your skin, because he offends your grown-up, seriously minded, it's all about me, soulless view of the world, go back to your scheming ways and board rooms this movie will grate on your nerves. If you like trains and unique animation give it a go it's actually quite fun to watch. <br /> <br />PS Edward Scissorhands is a great movie also &lt;g>.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has really done it this time. She's managed to give something to the die hard fans that have been with her from the early dayz, as well as those who jumped on the late train in her career. The album explodes with glitter amid disco balls that flash you back and jerk you into future disco with a non-stop stream of dance pop that's finger snapping/toe-tapping good. \\"Get Together\\", \\"Sorry\\" \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"Jump\\" will make you jump out of your seat. This is by far M's best album since Ray of Light. Trussst me darrlinks. You won't be disappointed. But never mind me. Hop to it and find out for yourself.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|The very best of Anastacia!!! There are all her albums' hit singles, and this should be enough to decide to buy it, but the new tracks make it a real masterpiece!!! 'Pieces of a dream''s simply hypnotizin' and addictin', and with 'Everything Burns' you'll cry and shout as you've never done!!! 'In your eyes' and 'I belong to you' with Eros Ramazzotti are romantic and touchin', great songs!!! The 'Megamix', mmmh, well, is a mega-mix!!!It's too bad she didn't include her single 'Boom', but if you're a real fan of Anastacia, absolutely, in any case, YOU MUST OWN IT!!!
B000BGR0OM|4.0|It really is known that when it absolutely comes to greatest hits records, they most of the time can be either a hit or a miss when reflecting upon an artist, and their careers. Yet, most of the acts from the 80's have always made some great comebacks with hits packages. This year has been no acception with hits packages from Bryan Adams, Mike & The Mechanics, and other acts. But out of all the universal acts, the Eurythmics have been one of the most down to Earth ones. With Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart's collaborations, they've made a part of pop music history that has been untouchable. Now that music has been packaged all into one.<br /><br />The Eurythmics Ultimate Collection, is a single disc compilation consisting of all of their big 80's hits. The album and the tracks have all been digitally reissued, and repackaged nicely. The album includes so many great songs including Here Comes The Rain Again, the 80's anthem Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), There Must Be An Angel, and the driven Missionary Man, to name a few. The album also includes a few recent favorites like their reunion track 17 Again from their late 90's album Peace, as well as a few new additional tracks, which sound great.<br /><br />Yet, for those who have the 1991 Eurythmics Greatest Hits package, might not be so sure about this compilation. Nevertheless, this is a better reflection of one of the most unique groups of the 80's. It is just so easy to forget about of the great 80's acts, but the Eurythmics will make you rejoy those Sweet Dreams.

B000AA305M|2.0|I have been a David Gray fan for many years.All his previous albums are four or five star rated.But this one is just not up there for me.Its way too refined.I am/was used to his loudish voice,stand out acoustic guitar and the rawness that came with it. <br />Not his best.Songs to look out for are 1.Alibi ;7.Aint No Love;5.Slow Motion. <br />Maybe it will grow on me with time.David Gray albums tend to do that.As of now its still 2 stars.. <br />What copy protection are you talking of??
B000000OUJ|5.0|Well I really do not need to get into a long review about this album because everyone else pretty much said it for me.  This is one of the best hip hop albums ever and along with Nas's first album Illmatic, the best lyrical album of all time.  The beats are all grimey and bangin too.  I do not have any one favorite track on this album because this album is very consistent and no one track on this album outshines another.  This album along with Raekwons: Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, and Wu-Tang Clan's first two group albums are all classics.  One Love...Wu-Tang Forever

B000B8QEZG|3.0|Well, as a Madonna Fan, I was expecting an espectacular album production. Sadly, I was really disspointed...I`m starting to think that Madonna`s talent is going so far away. Where are those cool lyrics? I mean...since American Life she has been going worse and worse...what the funk is that of : \\"I don`t like cities, but i like New York...\\" and then that stuff about she feels like a dork\\"????? Maybe she needs again the BIG help from Patrick Leonard to make cool songs like \\"Frozen\\" That`s a real song...Anyway...Let`s talk about the tracks: <br /> <br />there are some high-lights in the album like <br />\\"Hung Up\\", it`s a good dancing song, and that`s all. Lyrics are simple and anyone could have written`em. \\"Like it or Not\\" is another nice song, it makes me think about a bographical song. <br />\\"Get Together\\" reminds me of the \\"Metro Remix\\" for Cher`s 2001 \\"Song For The Lonely\\" (which i liked more), but it`s ok... <br />\\"Future Lovers\\" has a very similar rithm and sound to Kylie Minogue`s 2000 track \\"Light Years\\" <br /> <br />Confessions On A Dancefloor is a good album, but just that. Madonna could have done  a better work on it and she didn`t. <br /> <br />
B000BTJDGC|3.0|If nothing else it was nice to see a \\"possession\\" movie that wasn't just a clone of 'The Exorcist.' I didn't really expect very much from the film though, and was pleasantly surprised when I wound up liking it. <br /> <br />Playing devil's advocate though (pardon the pun, I couldn't help it), I think I understand why some people may be a little critical. For me, the movie seemed very schizophrenic; as if it was torn between wanting to be a horror movie or a courtroom drama. This seeming indecision on which direction to take the film is noticeable and it hurts. The change of pace between the legal scenes and the flashbacks is severe. <br /> <br />The acting, I felt, was average. Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson were both very good; conversely, Campbell Scott was just awful as the lead prosecutor. So, call it a wash. <br /> <br />The story's interesting, even despite the issue I mentioned earlier with the pacing. The production value is good, I felt like all the effects were all pretty well done. There was no half-hearted CGI shots inserted anywhere (i.e. `End of Days'). <br /> <br />Overall, I'm not sure you NEEDED to see this in the theater; I felt it would translate just as well as a rental. You could have honestly done either with a clear conscience though. Although I certainly wouldn't say it's a \\"must-see\\" it's definitely worth your time.

B000BGH22W|2.0|OVerall, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Soundtrack was an enormous disappointment. Sadly, I found it lacking in memorable themes, the magical whimsy of its predicessors, and utterly out of place. <br />   Patrick Doyle is not a bad composer, don't get me wrong. However, I don't think his area of expertise lay in this genre and it was a mistake of the producers and directors of this film to choose him in light of John William's Absence. (for those of you wondering, Mr. william's did not write this score due to poor scheduling on his part (he was too tied up with \\"memoires of a Geisha\\")) <br />   Now, to the music itself. <br />    OVerall, i found this listening experience very unmemorable. Doyle is suited for a more historical, classical film style. He is excellent at composing for a more reminiscent, neoclassical feel (heard in the beginning of \\"QUidditch WOrld Cup\\"), which Harry Potter most certainly isn't.  <br />   With the exception of \\"The Black Lake\\", I found most of his more intense pieces were composed mainly of blaring horns and rushing strings, repeating the same frenzied antics over and over again. <br />   For his slower pieces, such as \\"Potter waltz\\" or \\"Harry in Winter\\", I found them to be very simiple (not necessarily bad) and difficult to follow. By this, I mean simply that music is supposed to tell the story. Many of his slower pieces gave off a feel, but not a sense of accomplishment. These generally revolve around a simple pattern used by many composers consisting of a major first, fourth, and fifth, and minor thirds and sixths. String these together with some well placed traveling notes in between and ta-dah! We have \\"Harry in Winter\\" (for example). <br />   Unlike my previously listening experiences with Mr. Williams (very magical times to be sure), I felt unsatisfied and groping to remember even the simplest of themes. However, the music is still good and I will put it on every now and then. <br />   Finally, we come to it at last. Thefinal three songs. I am not a fan of Jarvis COcker. I hadn't heard of him before he did this music and pray desperately that I will not hear him again. \\"Magic Works\\" and \\"THis is the Night\\" sounded vaguly reminiscent of a post-Beetle style (a group I also dislike emmensly), but much, much worse. <br />   Then, if that isn't bad enough we come to \\"Do the Hippogriff\\". If you really want to know what a man having his entrails and fingernails removed with an old, rusted knife sounds like, listen to the first thirty seconds of this song and you'll know what I'm talking about. <br />     If you are looking for some decent backround music, I have to say that this is deffinitely better than some of the stuff we have out there today. Just ignore the abominations at the end. <br />
B0009I7NNA|3.0|This new cd from sevenfold is ok.....Nothig special but then again the music did get a little better guitar wise but what happened to the badass vocals now he sings more booo.....but overrall it's ok cd definetely worth money....rec check out there other 2 albums for u newcomers much better....
0553801503|2.0|Admittedly I am only 300 pages into this book but up to this point I have been very dissapointed.  I have been so dissapointed in fact that I came back online to see what others were writing about this book.  I researched and realised it is only half of a book and most of the characters that I enjoyed in the series are not written about at all in this book.  Supposedly those are coming out in a later book, I'm not sure, go to his website if you want.  The whole book was going to be too long so Bran, Tyrion, and Daenerys are not even included along with other very intersting characters.  I found the story with out their presence to be dull and uneventful.  Everything that does happen is to characters that I personally don't really care about.  Its not only that, this book needs a new editor, I'm finding it slow.  The information that is included is often just to show off Martin's knowledge of his own world(ex. he often writes long lists of knights, their standards and their house for no reason).<br /><br />Some of the chapters and characters are good, but so far for me it has not been worth reading through the dregs in the other chapters.  If you like series about the characters and like following the characters you fell in love with then maybe this book is not for you.  There is a big difference between killing off a character (understandable) and just plain not writing about one half of your characters, and probably the more exciting half(lunacy).
B0002F6AZC|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when i was little at the theaters. I was not scary but it was fun. I'm not into anthology movies but i like this movie even though is not like the first one. The segment the raft is the best. Like the animation wrap around too.
0679745653|3.0|The central theme that brings together the stories in the book Breakfast at Tiffany's is personal loss. In the story \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" Holly and her husband separate, which is the first personal loss in the book. In \\"A Diamond Guitar,\\" an old man loses a younger man that he loves. This theme is present in all the stories.<br /><br /> The way these stories are all based on a common theme makes in easier for the reader to connect the stories more like a novel rather than a collection of short stories. This theme also serves as an organizational structure for the book. Although all the stories are unique, they all focus on the same issue.<br /><br /> The aspect of this book that sets it apart is its excellent organization. The way the stories are put together and all relate to each other shows how it is organized very well. The order that the stories are in also portrays the good organization because as the book progresses, the stories develop each other to form a main concept that is complete at the end.<br /><br /> In conclusion, Capote's well written book Breakfast at Tiffany's has an exemplary connected theme throughout all the stories it contains. The book connects to everyone who picks it up by relating to personal loss in several circumstances. Without a doubt, Breakfast at Tiffany's is Truman Capote at his finest.

B00005JNJV|3.0|...where all's been done and seen before, so where all the \\"Best movie ever!\\" or \\"Fantastic!\\" comes from, well -personally I have absolutely no idea. It's a good movie, it's mindless fun -fantasy, and that's all. The beginning of the movie reminded me instantly of \\"Highlander\\" (the first one of those), the rest of it could have been inspired by a thousand other \\"dark\\" action-movies (\\"The Crow\\" as an example). So take it easy now, Batman-maniacs. Bale is a good actor, and \\"suits\\" his part -Oldman sadly wastes his talent (my favorite actor), the same goes for Freeman and Caine. No disaster, but nothing remembarable here. I couldn't help feeling that the script was missing something. And from the beginning it is in such a hurry, and at the same time this is quite a long movie. Not a good combination. In other words; Highly overrated, but entertaining. And worth seeing. I'd rent before buying though.
B000B63EZG|3.0|Sew up \\"Master of Puppets\\" with Iron Maiden and In Flames riffs and a predisposition towards gothic lyrical melodrama and artistic expression a la The Cure (\\"Tears Don't Fall,\\" \\"Hand of Blood,\\" \\"Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do),\\" etc.). Then, add some kids with a tour van full of black hair dye and replacement belt studs, and you have this band.<br /><br />Like other albums made by bands pillaging the legacy of Gothenburg, \\"The Poison\\" is chock full of harmonized lead guitar set against a pounding rhythm section, and the vocals swerve between the extremes of an on-the-verge-of-suicide Billie Joe Armstrong and Varg Vikernes with a sore throat. It's too hard to be pop, but it's too whiny to be metal; it's too derivative to be praised as a classic, but Bullet for My Valentine are too Welsh to be overlooked by record companies in the wake of other successful acts from Wales like Funeral for a Friend and Lostprophets.<br /><br />Like the records that inspired it, \\"The Poison\\" gets old quick, but moments of unadulterated six string masturbation sprinkled throughout will bring you out of the inevitable tunnel vision reverie Bullet for My Valentine's songwriting will induce.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're itching for a new Atreyu record, here it is. Otherwise, skip it.

If u like this kind of film u must be sick..Watching 2 girls getting stabbed, cutted and raped and beaten...I dont know why i watched this..
B000BGH22W|3.0|First off, I want to conduct an experiment - I'm writing a detailed review - albiet a negative one about this score, though I am sure it will garner tons of \\"unhelpful\\" points because fans will use it simply as a popularity contest(well, we'll see).  I have been somewhat indifferent to John Williams' previous Harry Potter scores.  Granted, they have been memorable, and his themes were great, but somehow I felt there was so much more potential and that Williams' score was too \\"ordinary\\".  When I heard Patrick Doyle was now doing HP4's score, I didn't know whether to be interested or not.  I haven't heard too much about him doing this kind of work, so I decided to just wait and hear it before making any prejudgements.  And so, here we are.    Doyle's score is not memorable.  That's not to say it is bad.  Only that it doesn't quite give you anything to stick in your mind after a listen.  Perhaps it fulfills the job of sticking with the image on screen and presenting underscore to fulfill it's duty, but other composers have shown us music can add to the film rather than just support it.  Doyle doesn't not do this.  John Williams sometimes did this too, but at least he presented some good themes mixed into the mush.  Doyle does provide themes, but they are not too memorable.  I don't know how well it works in the film, but it just sounds too \\"heard it all before\\".  There isn't much original concepts.  And again, reused concepts can sound good when done well (like John Williams), but Goblet of Fire just ends up sounding like one big mush of unmememorable music.    The CD opens with \\"The Story Continues\\" which presents some expected kind of music with Hedwig's theme popping up but not doing much other than being present.  There isn't too much of Williams' previous themes being used throughout the album.  \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" is something of a joke.  We swiftly move through some uninteresting tracks of average underscore, the kind that you watch in the movie and don'treally remember later, and find \\"Rita Skeeter\\", a track which certainly does not live up to the potential of it's subject.  Some unexciting string play is what Doyle uses to represent this character.    We continue with the uninspiring underscore in \\"Sirius Fire\\" until we reach \\"Harry Sees Dragons\\", an average track which manages to hold interest while again, not presenting much in originality.  \\"Golden Egg\\" starts with some bombastic material and continues into the cliched action scoring.      \\"Neville's Waltz\\" is of course appropriately title as a waltz.  It is really the first interesting track in the album, and leads to the next track \\"Harry in Winter\\", which opens with a theme that sounds like it's for another movie.  Nevertheless, I can say it is the first track I enjoyed listening to thusfar, and I hoped it would bring about more good parts to come.  His approach to the track isn't that new, high strings playing the sweet melody with a lower support.      The big higlight, is, of course, \\"Voldemort\\", as it represents the big villain and climatic higlight.  The approach isn't too original, scary chords with brass and rumbling percussion.  \\"Death of Cedric\\" was really the moment I was looking forward to in this movie, as it is a fantastic emotional moment in the book, but I was severely disappointed with what Doyle provides.  It is just way too dull and formulaic with it's \\"sadly\\" vibrating high strings and doesn't get emotional at all, leaving you wishing for something that did.  The score kicks off with \\"Another Year Ends\\", which I suppose is a satisfactory \\"The End\\" piece with it's balance between happy and sad.    I may have seemed a bit harsh during my review of the individual tracks, but I will say, as a whole, the track isn't bad.  It's just that there are zero memorable moments present.  It is a decent film score to support the film, but it never amounts to anything more than that.  It sounds too much like \\"auto-compose\\" and I never hear anything original or anything which really gets your attention.  It is an average film score and not more or less.  Is it better that Williams' previous scores?  No, I don't think it is, but it is a decent score in it's own right to support the film.  However, I don't think I will relisten to it any time soon.
0804106304|3.0|The Joy Luck Club, I cannot help but admit, is a good book. It is a book that is precisely what daughters and mothers should read as I believe it reveals a lot of the infrastructure of these relationships, and has the capability to make such people aware of their own relationships. Not that I'm saying this book is a tell-all self-help book, revealing the Top Ten Secrets to Successfully Getting Along With Your Daughter, or the Top Five Real Ways that Daughters Piss off Their Mothers. It is, of course, fiction. It is a book of interlacing short stories about Chinese mothers and their American/Chinese daughters. It is a story of the clash between mothers and their daughters, both literally and metaphorically through the addition of the cultural differences that seem to separate them. Each daughter has her own trial that she must overcome, and, in some way, it is reflective (or refractive) of her own mother's trials that she struggled with while still in China. Amy Tan beautifully demonstrates that the relationship of the mother and daughter is so closely related that it moves beyond blood and into circumstance, and that not even culture or language can separate them. <br />The only problem with this book comes from the fact that I am a guy. I have no doubt that I am a guy, and therefore am quite secure in saying that this book is not for guys. A guy may read it, may be entertained by it, but it won't hold the same impact, the same punch that it delivers to the women who read this book. Only vicariously can I feel the emotion that Tan is putting into this book, and that only through seeing someone else, female, reading the book and talking about how close to home it hit them and how close to tears they got. Otherwise, all I see is a bunch of women having their problems, arguing about them, and coming to some sort of conclusion by the end. Though, I say this while at the same time complementing Tan's prose, and being amazed at her ability to put words and cultures together to create such a beautiful volume of stories. I don't know, maybe it's just the fact that almost every guy in this story seems to be described as being ignorant, dumb, or, in some form, a dirty rotten jerk. I've heard bad things about my sex (being gender, just so you know), but I'm not convinced that we're all bad (or that these women aren't, in some way, just as bad... but I will duck away before I make anyone mad and cease my meandering comments).  <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I was really skeptical when I first listened to the album but I was so blown away by what I was listening to I was pressing the repeat button for almost every song!!!! Okay, so it ain't no Ray Of Light or Like a Prayer but thank God it ain't no American Life either! And before anybody starts bitching and moaning about how Madonna has totally lost it and how this album sucks, think about this for a minute: She still got you talking about her even after more than 2 decades.
0596007124|5.0|I mean, I agree that this book wouldn't exist if not for the GOF book, but seriously, I think these people have done such a better job of actually teaching and presenting the patterns to everyone that I think everyone should first read this book before they read the GOF book. Now, it's a different question whether you can stand the dull style of the GOF book after having read this awesome and fun to read book.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|Must everybody mimick and repeat what someone else has said, this whole review of Mariah's album  releases has turned into a slinging match and to who's benefit, it's a review of the album not about her backside or how she should kill herself.<br /><br />I am disgusted at some of the inhuman cattyness and immature behavior of some people, think about it and stop being so judgemental about her personality and choices.<br /><br />That is what other websites are for, go say what you think on that.  It is a fact of life that people do things to boost their status, so what! I am sure we all do it at some point, unless your Mariah Carey does it really matter, you make a choice to buy a new edition or not and if you don't fine, if you do fine.<br /><br />Like Mariah re-releasing her album hear yourselfs bringing up the same tired/nasty arguments which is annoying.<br />This is about the album which is what is matters here not the other crap.<br /><br />Well I like it, I think the work with other artists is a bit overdone and some songs sound similiar to others, but overall I think is a good piece of work.  No I wouldn't buy the diamond deluxe version that came out on 27th of December 2005, I think one copy is enough, I really like the Ultra Platinum Edition [ cd/dvd combo] with the 4 extra tracks and the dvd with 4 video clips and the website link to don't forget about us video which is probably the best value for money, so instead their are websites avaliable where you can probably download the extra songs such as don't forget about us pt 2 and the extra we belong together versions and if you did purchase an earliar version, well I'd do the same and when she decides to re-release it again well someones bound to have it online on a paying site, which is what I would do, I think it is a smarter move.<br /><br />Mariah Careys new style of music, since Daydream has definately grown on me, since following her career from the begining, I know shes now singing what she loves, so if your like me definately listen to her album a few times and the others, she certainly has versitility and talent, this album has all the goods.bum a few times and the others, she certainly has versitility and talent, this album has all the goods.
0340818867|5.0|I'm English, and having just devoured this book in a day or two I have to say that it is extremely accurate! It made me laugh out loud on the train while reading, which as you'll see from this book is an unusual occurrence for someone from my country... <br /> <br />This book describes the amazingly complex and intuitive set of rules by which we English live. It covers our obsessions with privacy, understatement, humour, anti-boastfulness, excessive politeness and all the other motives and societal rules behind the way we act.  <br /> <br />Non-English readers will cry \\"What?! Is that really true? Do the English really think and act like that?!\\" - and I can assure you that we absolutely do...  <br /> <br />An enlightening, funny, thorough and brilliant portrait of the English. <br /> <br />
B00005NB0H|4.0|I recently wrote up a list of some of the greatest live albums in the history of rock and pop music.  I never really considered the original release of 'Live at Leeds' in that list although when I had this CD in my collection way back in the early '90's, I could say that it wasn't one to disappoint.  I recently obtained this (The Deluxe) version of 'Leeds' and this can more than just be added to the list, this should also go down as a masterpiece of rock music.  I've always been a fan of the rock opera Tommy and the fact that they included the original performance of this is truly a spine-tingler.  The band is in top form on this recording and the performance stands out considerably.  This marks an achievement especially with what technology was at hand back in that time (late '60's, early '70's).  An excellent addition to the collection. As well, a timeless addition to my digital (MP3) collection.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When fans and pop radio stations lost interest in American Life (which was a decent album, saved by Die Another Day, Nobody Knows Me, Hollywood, and Nothing Fails), Madonna knew she had her work cut out for her.  She decided to put her preachy, Kabbalist perspective on hold in favor for fluffy dance music.  The stretch from Hung Up through How High is breathtaking.  Highlights include the most commercial track Hung Up, followed by my personal favorite Get Together with its Daft-Punk inspired soundscape.  It's reminiscient of the remixed rendition of Holiday from her smash Re-Invention Tour.  It's followed by the rumored 2nd single Sorry.  The chorus is beyond catchy.  Mirwais pops up with Future Lovers, a brilliant filler, for an album heavy on potential hits.  As silly as the lyrics to I LOVE NY, Madonna's confrontational, in your face persona reappears and boi do we wish we saw more of it throughout the album.  It's followed by another great filler, LEt it Will be, perhaps sampling Die Another Day?  NO complaints here.  Forbidden Love is another favorite of mine.  This is the closest moment we get to touch a ballad.  Perhaps my favorite filler of the bunch.  Another potential single is JUMP, reminding us of how capable Madonna is in creating a simple, catchy pop tune.  The buzz ends after How High, a highly entertaining, however preachy, song.  The final quarter of the album, containing ISAAC, PUSH, and LIKE IT OR NOT is rather disappointing, primarily due to Madonna's incessant belief in conveying 'deep' messages to the masses.  However, there are 5 potential global smash singles, and between them are excellent fillers.  Perhaps one of Madonna's greatest albums and a must buy.  Album of 2005!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah Carey, the comeback queen of 2005, shocked the industry with her deservedly successful album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\"  (See my 4-star review for my thoughts on the music)  It achieved what was considered unthinkable just three years ago: multiplatinum sales and a string of hits for the once-troubled diva.  Apparently, that's not good enough for Universal, the parent company of Mariah's label.  This week, they've released two additional editions of \\"Mimi,\\" and, frankly, neither of them is worth your time and money.  The \\"Ultra Platinum Edition\\" has four bonus tracks and a DVD featuring the music videos \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"We Belong Together,\\" \\"Shake it Off,\\" and \\"Get Your Number.\\"  Before I get to the bonus material, I can't help but wonder why Universal felt the need to release a total of FOUR versions of the same album within one year.  It's part of an unsettling trend in the music industry (forcing fans to pay for the same music at least twice), and it proves just how desperate these labels are for sales.  The additional bonus songs include the single \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" and a remix of her Number One hit \\"We Belong Together.\\"  They're not bad, but why couldn't these tracks be released separately on an EP?  Adding a mere four songs onto previously released material is frankly insulting.  As I mentioned before in another review, I have nothing against labels that reissue classic records.  But re-releasing a multiplatinum album within months of its release is tacky and it's an all-too-transparent way to milk a cash cow dry.  If you have no version of \\"Mimi,\\" and you really love Mariah, then this edition is the way to go.  But if you already have the original release and you feel the urge to grab this one, then you should follow the advice of one of Mariah's titles: shake it off.
6305137293|4.0|HALLOWEEN 2  HE'S BAAAAAACK     Michael Myers returns to reek havoc on teens every where, and Jamie Lee Curtis is at the top of his menu. Of course Donald Pleasence is still on the hunt for the serial killer, and this film will be the one to leave a Permanente mark on him. When viewing this film it is easy to see that even though the film is good it just isn't the classic the first movie was. The thing that might be the answer to that is probably because a different director steps up, Rick Rosenthal. Don't get me wrong he does an excellent job but he's the having to follow up behind John Carpenter. Speaking of which John and Debra Hill {R.I.P.} return as both producers, and writers. Which pleased me greatly.      The story follows as such, it picks up directly where the last left off with Myers being shot out of the house then not being there. Michael is after Jamie again and to get there he has to visit the hospital. Of course it's the same slasher thing, Horney people getting cut up, nothing new. But it still serves its purpose when Michael lurks from the shadows in one scene where his mask slowly comes forward. That was great, truly worthy of mention.     Over all this is a worthy sequel all though at times it falls flat.
B000002MY3|5.0|This album is a voice for a generation and I was a part of that generation. It's my favorite cd in my collection and a true gem and everyone need to pick up this cd to see what all the fuss was about. The song a wonderderful from start to finish and I wouldn't wanted any other way. The rawness of her voice and how she sings each song it wonderful. She pave the way for artist like P!nk because before P!nk their was Alanis. She will always be the one true rocker of the 90's if you ask me.
B000003RCY|3.0|I began listening to Rammstein when Reise, Reise was released. I was so impressed that I bought both Mutter, and Sehnsucht because I loved the band so much it made me sick. Then, recently, after hearing Herzeleid for the first time, I realized how much Rammstein has progressed since that time. This album, with the exception of Hereite Mich and Rammstein, is sub par and lacks the essential combination of neu Rock sound with heartfelt lyrics. Rammstein is my favorite band, but I can't seem to find anything breathtaking in this particular album.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to admit. This album was completely above the standards I expected from her, given the trivial matters of her last album. Well, this album is not for ballad lovers. So, don't grumble. That's one thing that needs to be said. So if you like ballads, please skip this album.   Madonna makes a smashing come back with this retro 80's anthem styled album. In a sense Madonna has gone back to her roots. This album showcases a diva on the disco floor no doubt giving her confessions as she says on the dancefloor.  Her first single \\"Hung Up\\" Sample's with an ABBA an anthem that makes the 80's edge go for a modern spice up. The single went to number one in 25 countries worldwide since it's release. The remixes are also not bad for the single again.  The second single to be released this Febuary 2nd which is \\"Sorry\\" is a song filled with a thumping disco driven bass and repetitive choruses. This song is about forgiving and not hearing of it. Here we see her speaking in many different languages all of which say sorry. It's interesting to see her going on a cross cultural tour in a way.  The next may be single is \\"JUMP\\". And it really does mean jump/ Because the track has a disco thumping background that immediately puts hydrenaline into your veins. it has a heavy 70's and 80's disco influence. Something you might find back in the days of \\"GREASE\\" and other films of that time.   \\"Isaac\\" is a rather rare choice song for such an album. The background instruments add a Middle Eastern flavor that, in this case works incredibly well. I think it may be an experimentation but it really does deserve a applause. The track talks of faith and freeing yourself. The track stretches for an amazing 5 minutes and 51 seconds nearly 6 minutes.  The next worthy note again unusual is \\"PUSH\\". The same influence of Middle Eastern. But a bit slower. Making it an all rounder groove marathon for both tracks.   The rest of the album is injected full of energy vibes that will make your heart thumpingwant more. But one thing's for sure. You won't stop grooving. This album is for club goers definitely, if you like retro club driven songs, 70's & 80's club anthem marathons. Then this is for you! So check this out and listen!
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|Ok, so we all pretty much have seen this already, why even release it on DVD over here? duh........anyway, I found this movie to be really boring and it didn't make too much sense.  The visuals are extremely good however.  I'm also not a huge Final Fantasy fan, so maybe that factors into my rating as well.
0780626966|5.0|This is just what I have been waiting for.  A complete box set of the greatest horror movie series of all time.  Nightmare 1 was awesome, introducing the idea that someone very evil could have the power to invade your dreams.  Even though the story for Nightmare 2 deviates from the Freddy bible by having him possess a teenage boy, it is still extremely good.  Nightmare 3 was fantastic with the return of Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson as Freddy works to off the remaining Elm Street Children.  Nightmare 4 is the MTV version of Elm Street where Freddy finishes off the last of the Elm Street Children and moves on to fresher prey.  Nightmare 5 is disliked by many fans but I personally loved the dark, gothic-y feel they gave and appreciated how they tried to put Freddy back in the shadows.  I was a bit disappointed with the slipshod rush job of Freddy's Dead.  I felt they could have made it a little bit longer and really flesh out Freddy's past a bit more.  It is still watchable, however.  Wes Craven's New Nightmare is freakin' genious.  Only Wes Craven could devise a way to take the movie out of the movie and turn it on it's ear into reality.  The 8th and last disc is the Nightmare Encyclopedia with every extra I could think of.  I highly recommend this box set for any Freddy fan or horror fan.
B0009NSE1K|1.0|A friend gave me this CD because he got it for free and hated it. I also hated it and threw it away. I think my friend is a total jerk for giving me crap like this. I guess this would be okay if you drive a Camero and wear a backwards baseball hat and a shell necklace. This type of music is a cultural dead-end.
1573223026|3.0|The premise of Nick Hornby's new book sets the tone accurately for the whole book. Four characters meet by chance on the top of a tall building, all of them having planned to throw themselves off, and they fall to talking and gang along for awhile.<br /><br />Not exactly realistic, is it, but as long as it's done well, not so eye-rollingly absurd as to make you quit reading.<br /><br />That's pretty much how the book goes. There were a few points where I laughed out loud-- once at Jess' teenage embarrassment, and once at Maureen's polite and innocent incomprehension of racy rudeness. Those two characters were a little on the stereotypical side, but fun. I sometimes mixed up the voices of the other two of the four; they just weren't as distinctive.<br /><br />At one point, JJ is leaning against a fence, wondering just what music he would play as the soundtrack to this moment, supposing he had an iPod or a Discman. At moments like this I felt the author himself was casting around, trying to feel his way to a story. I have a high tolerance level for that stuff, but if you like tight, plotted fiction, you'll grow impatient.<br /><br />The overall tone of the book is wistful, hopeful, and somewhat optimistic by the end.
1559408855|5.0|A group of bourgeois Fascists brutalize and degrade until the nastiness a host of teenagers. I must admit is not an easy going film to watch. Somehow this infernal state of desperation and anxiety was marking somehow the last days of this disturbed filmmaker. There are many points in common respect Fassbinder and Querelle in what it concerns moral degradation and the image of his own and fevered existence.
0451147960|3.0|I found this to be a rather unsatisfying book which left me with an itch to scratch..if you will forgive my allusion. Two reasonably, but not massively, successful artists are fed up with the ridiculous prices that art brings on the market, arguing that it's a form of snobbery which has no real bearing on the true value of the work. They set out to prove this by painting a series of brilliant forgeries of well known artists and selling them as previously undiscovered early works, with the intention of revealing the sales to the world press and causing a major scandal in the art world. There are several characters floating around in the story, such as the famous actress who starts taking drugs after meeting a new boyfriend who could be classed as a \\"bit of rough\\", and makes the reader wonder what on earth she's doing in the story, as well as the gallery owner whose wife favours multiple sex partners and who has no part at all to play in the overall story. I was very disappointed with this book.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan since the beginning. The quirky keyboard riff from \\"Everybody\\" still makes me smile. Madge and I did disconnect over some of her years as an artist. \\"American Life\\" and \\"Erotica\\" did kind of miss me a bit. But this album absolutely makes me want to jump around and do my best Madonna-rama in the living room. Excellent production and great vocals just make this album shine. I have read many reviews, some of which were lass than flattering. These people obviously do not care for her music to begin with. How could any Madonna fan not want to just want to put this CD on repeat and listen to it constantly. Some people find it better to be negative, like its cool or maybe its to get attention. The light you send out always comes back. Its a great album and I think Madonna is one of the most powerful artists of our time. She has sculpted pop music into many forms. To those that don't enjoy Madonna just listen to \\"Future Lovers,\\" \\"Let it Will Be,\\" or \\"I love New York.\\" How could you not like these perfect little pop gems. I love you Madonna, see ya later girlfriend!
B000B8QF00|4.0|Is Alanis hanging it up? After the startling mediocre acoustic remake of the classic \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album earlier this year, we now receive the first overview of Alanis' 10 year career.<br /><br />Simple titled \\"The Collection\\" (18 tracks, 73 min.), this is a somewhat awkward bringing together of many (but not all) of Alani's greatest hits and many (but not all) of her odds-and-ends tracks. Of course the emphasis is on \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", and rightfully so, but despite the 5 tracks from that album, no \\"All I Really Want\\", which was a huge radio hit. \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" gets only 2 tracks (\\"Thank U\\", now renamed \\"Thank You\\", and \\"That I Would Be Good\\", but no \\"Baba\\" or \\"Unsent\\"), the outstanding \\"Under Rug Swept\\" album gets only 1 song (\\"Hands Clean\\"; contrary to Amazon's listing above, \\"So Unsexy\\" is not on here; also no \\"21 Things I Want In a Lover\\" and \\"Precious Illusions\\"), while the mediocre \\"So-Called Chaos\\" album is represented with \\"8 Easy Steps\\" and \\"Everything\\". The remainder half of the CD is a hosh-posh of soundtrack contributions (including the classis \\"Uninvited\\" from City of Angels), B-sides, a song from the MTV Unplugged album (\\"Princess Familiar\\"), and one new song, the Seal-cover \\"Crazy\\", which is not bad, but certainly not essential.<br /><br />I think the public at large would've been better served with a straight-up \\"Greatest Hits\\", while the more in-depth fans would've been more interested in a true cleaning of the vaults. That said, there is no denying that there is a lot of good music on \\"The Colletion\\".
0446577383|1.0|This was exciting book, no doubt about that.  I did NOT like though the bashing of US in it.  I have read all his other books and didn't see ultra liberal messages in them.  I can get those messages from plenty of sources.  I am vet of VN War and don't like this kind of far left garbage like is hinted and stated in this book.  I wondered at times if moveon.org had written it.  Thanks
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Madonna, Who wrote the lyric's?? Your Kid's?? I have always been a fan and bought all your albums.  But I am not with you on this one. I can't believe that this Album is being compared to Ray Of Light.  Ray Of Light was a work of Art, this is just ok at best.  I understand that this is a dance album, but can't we have a little more thought and meaning in the lyric's?? And what is going on with your voice?  Well I guess you don't need one if there is nothing to say. I just think your better than this.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|It is great to have Annie and Dave working together again for now.  I love the effect time has had on Annie's Voice.  She has gotten better and stronger with age.  Her Sound is much more husky now then in the past. She is becoming a great soul singer.  The new song Ive Got A Life is a good opener and contrast for the rest of the tracks on the CD.  The rest of the CD has some of the Eurythmics greatest hit's.  This is a enjoyable collection for a Eurythmics fan.  This will hold you over until the next album.  We hope soon!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Every Album Madonna has done has been different and its what makes her great. Aside from Like a Prayer and Ray of Light which were lyrically and musically probably the best, Confessions is a great dance album. It's fun and upbeat. And to all those with negative thoughts comparing madonna to her old days... wake up! its 2005 not 1985. Music changes, times change and you obviously are still stuck in the past. So even more points to madonna for being in the \\"Now\\" and for being creative and just having a blast with this album. This is a cd to have fun and dance to not to critisize really! cmon...buy it and enjoy it
B00004RFCM|3.0|Hearing about this show for a long time I thought I better watch it to see what everyoe was talking about and it's actually pretty good. I cans ee why women love it and some men like it alos. I found the charactors really funny and wella cted. The stories where good but at times I wasent interested and found myself board with the topiocs the women where talking about. Overall the show is very real and that's great it's time they start to show real stuff on tv.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Just had my first full listen full blast on my  hifi... and I don't see a single reason for anyone of you still thinking of buying it! It's awesome! wow wow wow! The music is incredible...  great :) great :) no words to explain how this album make u feel!!
B000BIQKXM|5.0|It's been one album a year for Westlife since their debut in 1999, and after last year's Sinatra tribute \\"Allow Us To Be Frank\\", this one is a nice switch back to the pop ballads that made them famous.<br /><br />You may recognize several of the songs on this album, especially the first single \\"You Raise Me Up\\" made popular recently by Josh Groban, except that now it has bagpipes.  Second single \\"When You Tell Me That You Love Me\\" features Diana Ross, and music fans will also recognize \\"She's Back\\" (Human Nature); \\"Desperado\\" (The Carpenters, Eagles and others); \\"Colour My World\\" (Backstreet Boys, even if theirs is spelt Color); \\"In This Life\\" (Bette Midler, Ronan Keating) and \\"Heart Without a Home\\" (Nick Carter).<br /><br />The rest of the album is typical Westlife, except for \\"Hit You With The Real Thing\\" which sounds more like N'Sync or Five, and \\"Change Your Mind\\" which has a retro sound reminiscent of \\"I Can't Help Myself\\" (Sugar Pie Honey Love)\\" by the Four Tops, The Supremes, The Temptations and others.<br /><br />An album that will make most Westlife fans very happy.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 18, 2005
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 is one of the most inspirational and respectful rock groups of all time. Their music has stood the test of time and in many ways is associated with the soundtrack of our lives. They have sang through the turbulent 1980's, the complacent 1990's and have now established themselves as missionaries for a new and peaceful world order....and all the power to them, after all it is not common place nowadays to actually find a celebrity pop or rock group who are actually a good influence for a new generation of humanity. \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is a wonderful new beginning for a band that has never failed to inspire. Although it is not a groundbreaking piece of work, it is nevertheless a very good beginning for a new rejuvenated U2, singing in a new, uneasy era. \\"Atomic Bomb\\" is indeed a miracle drug for the masses....give it a chance, and it just might heal you... <br /> 1) vertigo (9/10) <br /> 2) miracle drug (10/10) <br /> 3) sometimes you can't make it on your own (10/10) <br /> 4) love and peace or else (8/10) <br /> 5) city of blinding lights (10/10) <br /> 6) all because of you (8/10) <br /> 7) a man and a woman (8/10) <br /> 8) crumbs from your table (7/10) <br /> 9) one step closer (8/10) <br />10) original of the species (7/10) <br />11) yehweh (8/10)
B0002S947K|5.0|First heard \\"Wild Horses\\" on public radio, and from that song alone, I had to have the album.  It is just \\"WOW.\\"  Smooth, quiet, sexy, yet powerful and bewitching in a way that I cannot decribe.  I have the cd in my computer at work and never tire of listeining to it. Good stress relief music.
B00000JCB2|1.0|When this album came out I remember two guys at school arguing about this group, one guy was saying that this album was so great that it blends rap and metal and turns into a masterpiece,\\" I mean this album will always be a classic\\" he said \\" they will sure save metal and become pioneers of rock\\". The other guy said that this band is dumb and terrible at best and that real metal was Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Pantera,Slayer and metallica and this band will fade out soon. I believed the first guy he said that they had great riffs and a hardcore singer and wow I felt duped buying it. First off if you bought this album and hate them now we should have a support group and sue Bizkit and their label for mental anguish and failure to put out a great product. To the album itself, My question is who told Fred he could sing, rap and write lyrics and how Nookie was ever popular at all. The guitar is good at best and I thought man where have all the riffs and solos gone. DJ was not a good add here, too many unnecessarry scratches and non guitar sounds. The songs were very immature, now I see why they were popular because it appealed to stoners and teens who spent hours watching MTV, they also never had any depth whatsoever which is only a recipe for a one hit wonder instead of musical classic or a genius work. At ending this group may have turned several good nu metal bands into pirayas and ultimately resulted into the dumbing down of the world, just look at their fans and ask yourself any question about them.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I'm dating myself by saying that I've seen both versions of the movie at the theaters. Now, I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time comparing both versions. Because if I did, I might as well be comparing apples and oranges. <br /> <br />Tim Burton has done a magnificent job with his interpretation of the story, and if you think you're going to see a remake of the original, then you're in for quite a treat. If you've read the book, it follows it more closely than the original. And most of all, if you like chocolate as much as I do, your mouth will be watering.  <br /> <br />Just as the you would expect, the movie is full of vibrant colors, wonderful effects, and surprises around every corner. The story of Willy Wonka and how he came to be is a welcome addition to the story, and Johnny Depp's portrayal of the estranged maker of sweet treats is outstanding. The Oompa Loompas in this version are very different from the original, and the guy who plays them is a riot. The performances by all the other actors are also terrific. There's no point in going into any detail about the story line of this movie other than you just need to see it for yourself. <br /> <br />Both movies are very different from each other, and you have to view this version knowing that. If you're expecting to see Johnny Depp make an attempt at copying Gene Wilder, then you're not giving him enough credit. As I mentioned before, this is not a remake of the original movie... this is simply Tim Burton's way of transforming the book into movie form, and presenting it in his own unique style. <br /> <br />Anyone who gives this movie a negative review simply doesn't get it. Their minds are closed, their imaginations lost, and they do not see this movie for all it's worth.
B000006OAM|5.0|I had never obtained anything by Natalie Merchant before purchasing a secondhand copy of Ophelia at a local used CD store. I was simply blown out of the water by her beautiful lyrics and incredible voice. Since this CD, I have also listened to Tigerlily and Motherland, the latter of which showed a deeper and more mature voice. Both CDs showed incredible talent (in my humble opinion), Motherland especially.  <br /> <br />I have to say though that Ophelia has moved me beyond compare. Ms. Merchant's voice, the enunciation of each syllable to its completion, the sense that she might be smiling during a certain word as it is being sung, singing the lyrics with such emotion from soaring and commanding to nearly a whisper---it's hard to describe, but just her vocal skills alone completely overwhelmed me, as if I were in a small room sitting next to her. Like other people who have reviewed this, I seem to gravitate toward certain songs such as  \\"Life is Sweet,\\" but more to my liking:  \\"Ophelia,\\" \\"Thick as Thieves,\\" \\"My Skin,\\" \\"The Living,\\" among others, all of which I could expound on the implied messages (as I interpret them). \\"When They Ring the Golden Bells\\" was also beautifully executed, brings a tear to my eye, as the message is so sweet and utterly hopeful, no matter that the words were written so long ago. The final portion of the CD, instrumental, reprises the first selection (Ophelia). Beautiful. Gorgeous. <br /> <br />I could not recommend another CD more highly. Yes, some of the lyrics might sound depressing, but who on this earth hasn't ever struggled with difficult issues in their life and hoped for comfort or understanding? This CD gives both and more. Buy it and play it on a quiet night, when you can listen to it in its entirety with no interruptions. Depending who you are or what you like, you may keep listening to it many more times to come. I would give it 10 stars if I could and nominate it for Natalie Merchant's best offering so far.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Madonna reminds me of the movie character \\"Charlie\\", who started out somewhat mentally challenged and then progressed into a more intelligent person, but by the end of the movie had regressed back to being retarded.  <br /> <br />Evidence: Confessions on a Dance Floor.  She basically hit a high note with Ray of Light and has been copying the Euro trance-dance mood from that album since, with little tweaks here and there.  Remember when Madonna would completely change it up with every album?   Now we get a string of rehashes.   Imagine Ray of Light, but with the lyrics written by her daughter.  And most of the songs sound like they USED to be a song, but the DJ she hired to produce it watered it down into a club song. <br /> <br />Is it danceable?  Somewhat.  Does it possess catchy hooks and melodies.  A little.  Are the lyrics horrible infantile?  In many cases, yes....\\"I love New York...other cities make me feel like a dork\\".   Nice.  And of course, we get the mandatory Kabbalah crap so that she can think of something \\"deep\\" to write about.  It doesn't work. <br /> <br />The album has some bright spots like Future Lovers and Push.   But for the most part, this is a yawner.  There's nothing worse than a 47-year old trying to act 25 years younger.  It's ok to be 47, but we expect more from someone with this much experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0553801503|3.0|I hate to say it, but this book was painful to read. I got into GRRM from the bad reviews on the Jordan books, saying \\"For a more enjoyable faster moving story read Martin\\". They couldn't have been more correct. I ripped through each of the first 3 books in 2 days each. I also didn't have any of my 3 children and my job was much less demanding at the time. So this may have something to do with why it took me so long to get through this book. <br /> <br />The real problem is that Martin is doing exactly what Jordan did (although none of Jordans books even comes close to GRRM). This book advances the story very little and it sounds like the next one will take place in the exact same time span. Translation..we are 6 to 7 years away from any plot advancement. We may be expecting a lot from GRRM's life expectancy. I think we run a real risk of this series not being finished. I hope for all of our sakes GRRM tightens up his story lines, sticks to the main POVs like he did in the first 3 books, and gives his editor enough time to strip some useless chapters out of the last books. <br /> <br />I gave this book 3 stars because GRRM is like Pizza. Even when he is bad he is still pretty good. If anybody is looking to fill time with some good fantasy reading try David Gemmell.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I just wanted to drop in and say that this is one of the best albums that I've purchased in 2005. I've been a Mariah Carey fan forever and this album has lived up everything it's been made out to be and then some. The vocals on this CD are great. In my opinion this album is equally as good as her debut. This is different from her others. It's a little more contemporary in feel and style which is good. This has been an incredible year for Mariah Carey on the charts for both singles and sales. I think the Ultra Platinum Edition is a amazing way to close out a great year.
B00005JKN9|5.0|this film is truly wonderful.  with a cast including leonardo dicaprio, daniel day-lewis, cameron diaz, and many others this film is nothing short of fantastic.  it takes place in the Five Points of new york city where the irish are fighting against the native americans. leonardo dicaprio plays an irish young man who's father was murdered in battle by the head of the americans in the five points. this film had wonderful cinematography and a wonderful cast! although this movie did not recieve as much praise as it derserves, it is still a sensational film with great acting and a great story.  this is a wonderful historical film and i would reccomend it to anyone!
B000001ELR|5.0|Kiss definitely kicks major rump on this album. despite Ace leaving with the making of this album, this album sounds much heavier than its predecessors.
B000002P74|5.0|This album is totally strong all the way through.<br /><br />From the mellow blues of Curtis Loew to the blazin' riffs of Workin' for MCA, Skynyrd nails it with this one.<br /><br />AWESOME!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|In 2003, Madonna went wrong with the release of her album American Life. There were quite a few filler songs and she didn't sound interested. <br /> <br />But now, she is back to her roots with a twist: Future Disco. <br />The tracks are amazing, and I mean it. You will want to get up and dance to every single one. Well, except for Forbidden Love. Here is my track by track review on a 1(lowest) to 10(highest) scale. <br /> <br />1.Hung Up 10/10 <br />The track is amazingly catchy. Even if you hate it at first, you will end up liking it. The chorus is so catchy, and ABBA is to be thanked partly for it. It runs over 5 and a half minutes, which is excellent because you can dance all the longer. <br /> <br />2.Get Together 8/10 <br />This song is a very feel good song. Its very clubby, even more than Hung Up, and has Madonna singing about love in a smooth, sexy voice. Running 5:30 minutes. Its a very Euro club dance song. \\"Do you believe in love at first sight? Do you want to get together?\\" asks Madonna on this hook up song. <br /> <br />3.Sorry 8/10 <br />Get Together leads into this next song where we hear Madonna saying \\"sorry\\" in diffent languages. The song builds up to the chorus and then boom. The chorus kicks in and we hear the old Madonna again. She proclaims her independence and tells us that she can make it on her own. Its slower that Hung Up and Get Together, but you can still dance to it. <br /> <br />4.Future Lovers 10/10 <br />I gave this song a 10 because of one reason: the beat is one of the most amazing beats I have ever heard. You have to wait a whole minute and a half before the chorus kicks in and its psychedelic. Its probably the only song that has a very 70s (yet futuristic) feel to it. <br /> <br />5.I Love New York 8/10 <br />The beat is very catchy. I didnt like it at first but then after a few listens I loved it. Cheesy and fun lyrics. <br /> <br />6.Let It Will Be 7/10 <br />This song is a little dark, yet its still very dancy. I dont know what to say about this song, to be honest. Its just pretty awesome. <br /> <br />7.Forbidden Love 4/10 <br />The weakest and only filler track on the album. Why she put this on here is beyond me. But the other tracks more than make up for this song. It just is no good, you can't dance to it. Check out Forbidden Love on her Bedtime Stories album though. That song is amazing. <br /> <br />8.Jump 9/10 <br />Very catchy, dancy song. One of the shorter tracks that could've been longer.  <br /> <br />9.How High 7/10 <br />Madonna sings about fame here, with a thumping beat playing in the background. Great song as well. <br /> <br />10.Isaac 7/10 <br />A Hewbrew singer joins Madonna on this song, the only song that really involves some Kaballah-ness to it. The song builds up and is quite funky. You can't really dance to it, but its still a good listen. <br /> <br />11.Push 10/10 <br />One of the best songs on the album. It sounds nothing like the rest of the album, but it still is amazing. It has a Middle Eastern vibe to it and is an extremely sexy song. <br /> <br />12.Like It or Not  <br />Has a very musical show beginning and the song is filled with \\"if you dont like it, oh well\\" lyrics. Great song.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie was absolutley brilliant. Even though I have the biggest crush on Johnny Depp, I would of still liked it without him (but I was glad he was in it). I remember the first night I saw it; I had some chocolate (ofcourse)and I thought to myself, what could be better than Johnny Depp in a movie about chocolate while eating chocolate? Let me tell you.....NOTHING!!!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|You have to give props for Mariah Carey to this great cd and she sings so beautiful and great that the same time. I think Mariah Carey and Mary J.Blige are the best singers of all times. My favorite songs is It's Like That,We Belong Together,Shake It Off,Say Somethin' Featuring Snoop Dogg,Stay The Night,Get Your Number Featuring Jermaine Dupri,To The Floor Featuring Nelly,Fly Like A Bird, We Belong Together remix Featuring Jadakiss,and Styles P and the new single Don't Forget About Us. If you don't have this re-release cd of The Emancipation of Mimi and go get it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the Zone takes Britney from her pop roots to . . . well, in the zone. I'm a big Britney fan but I didn't really expect much from this album. However, most of the songs on this album are HOT: <br />Me Against the Music 8/10 <br />Toxic 10/10 <br />Everytime 9/10 <br />OUTRAGEOUS 11/10: The best song on this album b/c R Kelly did his thing with production. <br />Showdown 9/10 <br />Early Mornin 9/10 <br />Brave New Girl 7/10 <br />I Got That (Boom Boom) 9/10 <br />Shadow 8/10 <br />Touch of My Hand 10/10
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is the album fans have been waiting for. Madonna continues to beat her own drum and has created \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\"--12 songs that sound like a holiday pumped with precious Madonna power. \\"Confessions\\" beats and lyrics  are reminiscent of songs past.  The continuous CD has somewhat of a trance/disco (unlike Erotica which is more electronica) vibe that'll have you shaking your shimmy even if you're not a fan. \\"Sorry\\" and \\"How High\\" are definite future hits. Madonna has gone full circle closing it with \\"Confessions\\" an hour long celebration that's bursting with energy.
0307276902|1.0|My mom heard all the hype about this book and rushed out and bought copies for everyone she thought would want one.  She didn't even get half-way through it and I have to say I'm still struggling trying to finish it.  If you have a weak stomach (constantly describing bodily fluids) or are offended by profanity (often uses the f-word) or enjoy correct grammar or punctuation (he uses none throughout), skip it.<br /><br />I would never have bought anything solely because it was recommended by Oprah anyway, I already made that mistake with rushing to the theater to see \\"Crash\\", she said, \\"If you see one movie this year, see Crash!\\"  I say, if you want to enjoy what you're reading or watching, skip Oprah's advice!
1400031087|1.0|Since there are over 700 reviews already posted for this book, I'd normally hesitate to add another, but maybe I can save someone else from being scammed by Mr. Frey. First, the writing is, as others have pointed out, repetitive, ungrammatical, self-indulgent, and repetitive (read one page of the book and you'll understand). Second, while many other reviewers have hailed this book's brutal honesty, they are only half-correct in their assessment. Brutal it certainly is, both in the things Frey describes and the method he uses to describe them, bludgeoning the reader into submission. Honest, however, I doubt that it is. Not only do I have a hard time believing some of the things he claims happened in a respected, world-famous re-hab facility, much of the characters, scenes and dialog are reminiscient of a bad movie. I suspect that ninety percent of this \\"memoir\\" is fiction. For instance, I Googled for stories of a former featherweight champion being shot outside of a crack-house (or just being murdered anywhere) and I came up empty. Gee, you think something like that would have made the papers.   <br /> <br />I have no doubt that Mr. Frey's journey through addiction, re-hab, and recovery was harrowing. I also have no doubt that, in that journey, there is a story worth telling. My guess is that he realized early on that he wasn't a good enough writer to make the story of that journey compelling, so he filled it with a tough-guy pose and host of made-for-TV dramatic clichs. In so doing, he crosses the line between poetic license and fiction. Of course, if this book had been marketed as fiction, no editor would have bought it. It's just bad, self-indulgent writing. <br /> <br />Oprah, your book club is great, but you need to have a higher standard than just the author's willingness to be on your show with his mom.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After the disappointment of American Life I was really hoping for Madonna to come through this time with her new album.  I enjoyed Ray of Light and Music a lot but I still enjoyed her pre-Evita music much more.  Madonna comes through with a dance inspired album that never lets up and rivals anything she has done in the past.  There are no really weak tracks on the disc and the album actually goes together quite nicely unlike the awkwardness of American Life. Confessions on a Dancefloor is a great party mix, car CD, workout CD and is great to just listen to. Madonna makes a complete rebound with her twelve new songs: <br />\\"Hung Up\\": Her first single, a great dance song to sing in the car or dance at a party.  A great catchy single, one of her best dance songs. <br />\\"Get Together\\": I didn't like it as much at first but after listenting to it a few times it has grown on me as it has fun disco beat.  Give it a chance and you will enjoy it. <br />\\"Sorry\\": One of my favorites. Great lyrics, great music, all together a great song. It'll get you moving.  Great choice for a single. <br />\\"Future Lover\\": Starts off a bit awkward and slow but picks up but after listening to \\"Sorry\\" it won't seem as good, but still a good fun dance song.  It has an 80's feel and will bring you back to Madonna's first album. <br />\\"I Love New York\\": A great song, even if you are not from New York, great catchy lyrics (aside from \\"the dork\\" line) and you'll see yourself humming it at work.  Get ready to here it all the time in the Big Apple. <br />\\"Let it Will Be\\": A good song with a nice 70's feel and a good beat but maybe my least favorite song.  I enjoy it but I don't connect it with like I do the other songs. If this is the \\"worst\\" track you know you have an unbelievable album. <br />\\"Forbidden Love\\": Both songs with the same title (the other being from her Bedtime Stories album) are fantastic.  I enjoyed the fast beat and another great club song. <br />\\"Jump\\": A fantastic song! Great music.  Hopefully it will be a single. <br />\\"How High\\": A tie with \\"Jump\\", another fantastic song.  These two songs in a row pack quite the punch. <br />\\"Isaac\\":  A good song and I enjoy the male vocal for a change and it seemes a bit similar to a sped up \\"Frozen\\" but a very good song and a nice change with the two vocals. <br />\\"Push\\": A tribute to her husband, a great song with a different beat and feel than the other songs.  I loved this song, could also hopefully be a single. <br />\\"Like it or Not\\": Maybe the slowest song on the album and that's saying something.  The first time I heard it I didn't know what to think of it but after hearing it a few times it has some great lyrics and music to it.  The last songs on her albums have been hit or miss with \\"Take a Bow\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\" being hits while \\"Gone\\" and \\"Mer Girl\\" misses and this defintely is in the former group.  A great way to end the album. <br />All in all, one of Madonna's best works, and not just Madonna's but one of the best albums in recent history.  I daresay it rivals \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"The Immaculate Collection\\".
0671799320|5.0|I was amazed by this book. On almost every page, I found myself gasping, and wanting to share the latest development or information with whoever happened to be in the room at the time. If I was on my own, I often still said 'wow' out loud.<br /><br />It's not just the information that is in this book, but the masterful way in which it is written. It is as gripping as any thriller.<br /><br />Ostensibly, it is the history of the oil industry, but this becomes so much more than a book about business. It's an excellent version of the history of the twentieth century, with all it's tribulations and compelling twists.<br /><br />I think this would probably be my desert island book. I plan to read it many, many times.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|I had not listened to my vinyl version of \\"Guilty\\" in its entirety in a long time, but after hearing the 25th Anniversary CD version, I was reminded of something that I first realized way back in 1980 - this is just a brilliant pop record. It has great songwriting, great production, and amazing vocal performances. Writing for Streisand brought out some of Barry Gibb's best songs, and singing these songs created some of Streisand's best vocal performances. Streisand is never less than amazing to listen to, but there is just something extra in her singing on \\"Guilty\\" that reaches a new level. I think that something extra is that she was having FUN singing these songs. The new interviews on the Dual Disc version seem to confirm this. Working with Barry Gibb at the height of his creativity was one of the best decisions that Barbra ever made and the result was this glorious example of pop brilliance.
055380457X|5.0|\\"The Google Story\\" is a book with a very wide appeal. Written by a journalist (David Vise), it is pretty much structured as a tale that can be enjoyed as much by the technically inclined as it can be loved by the ones focused on the business side of things. As much as you could argue that it's rather one-sided, I have yet to meet people who hate Google, in the way many people hate Microsoft. I am no one to say there's nothing to dislike about them (as a matter of fact, the book gives you plenty to read about this matter), but part of the point the book intends to get across is that they are very particular in terms of the way they positioned themselves from day one (notice I didn't say unique).<br /><br />Under the mantra \\"Don't Be Evil\\", the story of Google is one that is intimately tied to the personalities and life visions of founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. And as much as their success and meteoric rise of their stock may bother some, when you read the book you understand why they have gotten so far. Quite simply, it shows how they layed one brick upon another, focusing on developing an extraordinary product that addressed real needs of users, rather than burning expensive advertising dollars to create a buzz around empty promises (quite the norm at the time of the Internet boom, during which they started their company).<br /><br />A must for entrepreneurs at heart. One tale after another that geeks will enjoy. I give it five stars without a doubt. You will find yourself devouring it in no time, after you pick it up.
B000BT97AO|5.0|I had the very good fortune to see this little gem on the big screen. It's a lot to absorb! This is a movie clearly written for grown-ups who still retain their ability to sit still and let go with their imagination. It's a true work of art, and as a result, was not commercially viable in the United States. It barely made it into the theaters! What a shame!<br /><br />What is wrong with the vast majority of American movie goers? Here in the States we fawn over and spend huge amounts of money on formula-film-trash. But when a film with heart, mind-boggling originality, real imagination, great storyline, stimulating soundtrack, decent acting, wonderful cinematography, and amazing special effects by some of the greatest animators in the entire world, it barely makes a blip on the radar screen. Was this the fault of rather timid distribution? I'm sure it didn't help matters! But ultimately, it's the American desire for violence and perpetual petulant titillation that runs many a decent movie into the proverbial financial ground!<br /><br />I'm truly looking forward to purchasing this gem when it becomes available on DVD! One of the very few movies I have seen this year, which I would like to see a second time. While most of 2005 has been a year of terrible flops, and way too many disappointments, Mirrormask gives me hope for a brighter movie going future! Thank you all for sticking your collective necks out by making this surprisingly good film! It will certainly stand the test of time!
B000002UA2|4.0|Pink Floyd seem to be a band to hit the nail in the head every time they set out to do music for a movie. They can even record an album (supposedly) timed to a movie (\\"Dark Side...\\") even if it wasn't the original music FOR the movie. \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is the second album they recorded for a Barbet Schroeder movie (\\"More\\" being the first one), and the third soundtrack they'd put together. With the title track as one of Pink Floyd's darkest opening songs, the album navigates eventually into mellower territory, landing in \\"Wots... Uh the Deal\\", one of the most beautiful ballads they ever recorded, and yet another ballad (\\"Stay\\") which I cannot help enjoying too. Ironic how an essentially dark album, which opens and ends with eery instrumental tracks, can yield some of the band's softer works in years. If you are putting together your PF collection, there may better albums to get first, but this one will not stay away from it for too long.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Now, for every 10 people that love this band, there are 10 that despise them. Isn't that the great thing about opinions? Well, i'm sure by reviewing this I may be alienating myself from the underground BM scene for which I have loved many years. However, I don't care. I have been a Slipknot fan since 99. This is easily their best, it seems they are slightly limited in the studio, live though, nothing holds them back. The song's sound twice as heavy and they did a great job. I have always been a fan of live albumm's so this was a great suprise. i remember watching the \\"Disasterpieces\\" dvd a few years ago and hoping for a live album. I figured if the new album did well, there would be a good chance a live album would appear. Well, i'm sure you know the rest of the story. This is Slipknot. This is live in the eye of the storm.<br /><br />Chapter no. 1:<br /><br />1. The Blister Exists: After a short intro, the song kicks into full gear and is much heavier than the studio version. Great way to kick off the album. 5/5<br /><br />2. (Sic): Classic song from their first album. The drumming is wonderful and it really gets your blood pumping. Exspecially 23 seconds into it when the classic \\"Here comes the pain.\\" sample plays. 5/5<br /><br />3. Disasterpieces: My favorite Slipknot song ever. \\"Are you ready for a f**king war?\\" The song fully kicks in 1 minute into it. Corey's vocals aren't as dark as they are on the album but still great. 10/5<br /><br />4. Before I Forget: An emotional track. My favorite song off of Vol.3 the live version is as good as the studio one, Corey's vocals are awesome here. James guitar is even better that the studio 5/5<br /><br />5. Left Behind: Lead single off the Iowa album, I would have rather seen \\"My Plague\\" rather than this but still a great song. 4.5/5<br /><br />6. Liberate: as soon as Mick starts that single riff, you can FEEL the excitement in the crowd, the song does not dissapoint, live version is better than the studio one actually. 5/5<br /><br />7. Vermilion: I never was really sure of this song on the Vol. 3 album (part one or two) I t hought there we pretty good but never though that highly of them. However, like many songs they're actually better live. This is no exception. Corey's vocal's are almost spoken word like at the start. Haunting song live. 6/5<br /><br />8. Pulse of the Maggots: When I first heard this song a few months prior to the release of Vol. 3 I always thought this would be a song that they would rip up live (in a positive way) they don't let down. The siren kicks in and Corey's passionate intro/speech. Then Chris, Clown and Joey kick in with their drumming. A song to get hte blood pumping.<br /><br />9. Purity: \\"This next song...is about a girl in a box\\" On the first version of the \\"Slipknot\\" album. My second favorite Slipknot song ever. A truly dark and gritty song. Great live as well. One of the best here. 10/5<br /><br />10. Eyeless: Another classic track from their first album, 133's influences really shine here. 4.5/5<br /><br />11. Drum Solo: A long solo from Joey. Showing how great of a drummer he is. I mean, if he could fill in for Frost during Satyricon's American tour, I would not exspect anything less.4/5<br /><br />12. Eeyore: Hidden track from their first album. A song that just crushes, a mosh pit anthem at Slipknot shows. A good way to finsih off the first disk. Some of the most distorted guitar's Slipknot has ever used. 4.5/5<br /><br />Chapter no. 2:<br /><br />1. Three Nil: Definetly a favorite of mine off Vol. 3. This song builds into a giant. Sid shines here. 4.5/5<br /><br />2. the Nameless: I always enjoyed this track and it is actually better live too. The clean guitar portions are very emotional and so are Corey's vocals. One of the highlights off disk 2. A good suprise 5/5<br /><br />3. Skin Ticket: a song Slipknot NEVER played live before. Corey even announces they have never done it live vefore and it may be a \\"train wreck\\" it isn't though. It loses some of the atmosphere the studio version has. Still great though. Anything but a train wreck. 5/5<br /><br />4. Everything Ends: Another track I didn't exspect to hear. A fast paced song, with lyrics regarding Corey's attempted suicide as a teen over you guessed it....an ex-girlfriend. Joey does an incredible job here. Corey has a great \\"speech\\" at the end of this song. 4.5/5<br /><br />5. The Heretic Anthem: A true \\"anthem\\" from the \\"Iowa\\" album. has the o so classic chorus. Another song which is better live. Corey's \\"speech\\" in the previous song is actually refering to this one. 5/5<br /><br />6. Iowa: Geez, does Paul do a great job here. I love his bass here. A classic song, which is  actually suprising to hear live. One of the darkest songs Slipknot has to offer. The atmosphere is still here. 5/5<br /><br />7 Duality: Lead single off of Vol.3 Corey's vocals in the intro always remidned me of \\"Wait & Bleed\\" crowd really gets into this one. 5/5<br /><br />8. Spit it out: Actually, my favorite song off this album. So much better than the studio version. Few songs get me as pumped as \\"Spit it Out\\" live does. The studio version is about 2:30 minutes the live version is 5:29. The whole \\"Zero Bulls**t\\" thing is great. This is the song with the most crowd interaction. 25/10.<br /><br />9. People = S**t: One of the most \\"fist pumping\\" song's off \\"Iowa\\" is even more intense live. One of the heaviest song's here. 5/5.<br /><br />10. Get This: Lyric wise, a joke song. Off the \\"Slipknot\\" digi-pack. Hyper and fun is the best way to describe this. 4/5<br /><br />11. Wait and Bleed: more haunting vocals from Corey. Classic song and beautiful lyrics. The crowd is singing along the whole time. 6/5<br /><br />12. Surfacing: Classic live song. Also, the perfect closing song. Between the lovable angst in the chorus to Mick's screeching guitar. A memorable end to a memorable album. 5/5<br /><br />So, in conclusion. This is one of my favorite live album's as well as my favorite Slipknot album. If you love slipknot, get this know. They're not called one of the best live acts ever for nothing.d it may be a \\"train wreck\\" it isn't though. It loses some of the atmosphere the studio version has. Still great though.

B0000C0FJB|2.0|Sorry.  couldn't resist.  It's true though.  As one who has almost all the Rush vinyl (including rush through time)and both the early live LPs, I was really disappointed by sound quality.  I mean, I have boots (black forest comes to mind) that sound 10x better than this. <br /> <br />Guys gotta keep it sharp in their old age.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I would recommend getting this version of the CD. In my opinion the 4 extra songs and the videos are worth the price of this one. Mariah's current single \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is #17 on the Hot 100. \\"Makin' It Last All Night\\" is #3 on the AOL Music Songs chart.  \\"So Lonely\\" which appears in a longer version on Twista's album is included on this CD also. I prefer the one on Mariah's CD, but they're both good. And the \\"We Belong Together - Remix\\" is great. I would give all of the extra tracks a 5/5.  <br /> <br />The packaging for this is great. The CD booklet has a glossy cover and back. Mariah's name has silver embossed letters on the booklet. The DVD is terrific. All of the music videos are presented very well. This is an elegant package.  <br /> <br />If you were planning on buying this CD as a gift for the holidays. Then I would get this one. Don't be fooled by the backhanded compliments or negative reviews. This is a GREAT re-release. And for those that are big Mariah fans that already have the original, I would pick this one up also.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I heard, in July, that Roadrunner was going to be putting this CD together.  Then I saw that Joey Jordison was going to be one of the songwriters, and figured I would give it a listen when it came out.  Then, a couple of weeks before the release, Roadrunner released \\"Annihilation By The Hands Of God\\" for download on the site, and I was simply blown away by the sheer awesomeness of that song.  I knew that this album was a must buy if even one song sounds as awesome as ABTHoG.  Turns out, I love every song on the album, except \\"No Way Out\\", which has Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw on vocals.  The way he sings the song, it just doesn't sound like a typical Roadrunner song.  My favorite song on the album, however, is \\"The Rich Man\\" with Slipknot's own Corey Taylor on vocals.  He has such a range in singing, clearly demonstrated in this song.  He talks, sings, and screams in it. <br /> <br />I rate the songs as follows: <br /> <br />The Dagger: 10/10 <br />The Enemy: 10/10 <br />Annihilation By The Hands of God: 10/10 <br />In The Fire: 10/10 <br />The End: 10/10 <br />Tired 'n Lonely: 10/10 <br />Independent (Voice Of The Voiceless): 10/10 <br />Dawn Of A Golden Age: 10/10 <br />The Rich Man: 20/10 <br />No Way Out: 5/10 (Music is good) <br />Baptized In The Redemption: 10/10 <br />Roads: 7/10 <br />Blood & Flames: 10/10 <br />Constitution Down: 10/10 <br />I Don't Wanna Be (A Superhero): 10/10 <br />Army Of The Sun: 10/10 <br />No Mas Control: 10/10 <br />Enemy Of The State: 10/10 <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend that any fan of metal, or any band under the Roadrunner Records label definately check this CD out.  At least listen to it, if you don't buy it.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I am a hardcore Alanis fan and I totally love the album!!!  However, there are so many good songs that did not make the cut first of which is my all time favorite song by Alanis: SO PURE!!!!  Personally, I think she should have made a singles package with all the radio and tv singles released over the years.  Yet, the selected songs all have a special meaning to Alanis and hence the reason for their inclusion.   <br />She said: \\"Ultimately, I put this collection record together to have something to show my great-grandkids one day, and to reflect with objectivity on my own evolution as a writer and singer. I've always felt like acknowledging an era or a chapter of my expression is like a slate-cleaner, I really see this retrospective as a sorbet between entrees--and an opportunity for me to see where I'm coming from and indicating when I want to start out when I'm writing my next record next year. Also I've done a lot of far-flung things over the years--songs from movies or other projects--and I thought it would great having everything together in one place.\\"  <br />So the final cut was just about 18 songs.  If Alanis were to release a greatest hits package, it would ultimately mean re-releasing all her albums, cause they all contain great hits and songs and while the world acknowledged Jagged Little Pill, they failed miserably to give kudos the gems that followed. (SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE, ALANIS MTV UNPLUGGED, UNDER RUG SWEPT, FEAST ON SCRAPS, SO CALLED CHAOS, JAGGED LITTLE PILL ACOUSTIC) The Collection gives them an opportunity to taste what they have missed!  And right now, even as I type this, Alanis' latest single \\"CRAZY\\" is blasting over the radio!!!  I do hope that Alanis gets the credit she deserves and is not continually judged based on the whimsical desires of people...She is a true artist and will be around for a very long time! Keep rocking ALANIS!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is great!  I have been listening to this CD for the past 2 weeks and I love it!  I have it on my IPOD and its great to music to walk to!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I knew she had good reviews for this CD but when I heard it - WOW! I was so pleasantly suprised and blown away. From the FIRST listen I was on my feet dancing. This is without question the BEST CD Madonna has made and certainly one of the TOP dance CD's ever. Really great stuff. I can't stop playing it. You can dance to it... work out to it... drive to it... doesn't matter. I LOVE IT!!! DEFINITELY won't waste your money if you buy this one. Madonna you've outdone yourself. Keep it up!!  <br /> <br />
B000B8QF14|4.0|What I can tell you is this: If you were lucky enough to be a part of the live audience on the American Idiot Tour of 2005, you will have to have this CD/DVD set! Filmed at a live concert in England, this is basically a souvenir of the concert tour. Those who were present at any of the tour dates will be amazed at just how closely this concert footage mirrors their own experience at the show. Plus, the documentary part of the film gives insight into the unknown realms of the tour and the band.<br /><br />It takes some time to watch. The DVD is well over 2 hours long, but you can watch it a chapter at a time. I'm still astonished at the level of energy that these guys exert. It was truly an awesome show.<br /><br />This is not a \\"must have\\" album except for those who saw the band on the American Idiot tour or those who collect everything Green Day has done or those who wish they could have gone to the show. If you are a fan, you will love this CD/DVD set.<br /><br />If you went to the show, be sure to watch it with someone who didn't get to go. You can tell them things like, \\"Billie Joe did that in __________, too!\\" and \\"Wow! When that happened, we could feel the heat from the flames!\\" By the end of the film they will pretty much hate you.
B000002LAC|5.0|This recording, almost 20 years old now, has everything going for it: a varied and beautiful selection of songs, excellent backup musicians-- and most importantly-- the heavenly voices of Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. The rumor is that these fine artists wanted to do these songs for years but couldn't get their managers in sync. So we have a perfect example of what happens when performers and not the money men get their way.<br /><br />There are so many good songs here-- where to start? \\"The Pain of Loving You\\" by Ms. Parton and Porter Wagoner as well as \\"Making Plans,\\" also sung by the Parton/Wagoner duo. There is also Phil Spector's \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\" and a Jean Richie song \\"My Dear Companion.\\" Ms. Parton includes one of her own compositions \\"Wildflowers,\\" which is all about leaving home in order to grow. David Lindley's lacy autoharp playing is a perfect accompaniment for the women's etheral singing. One of my favorites is Jimmy Rodgers' \\"Hobo's Meditation,\\" which is straight out of the Great Depression and asks the plaintive question: \\"Will there be any freight trains in heaven/Any boxcars in which we might hide?\\" Then there's the last two selections: \\"Rosewood Casket,\\" where Mark O'Connor's weepy mandolin is perfect for setting the mood for this little tear-jerker; and the traditional hymn \\"Farther Along,\\" where each artist sings solo on a verse and is joined by the other two for the chorus.<br /><br />And if all this isn't enough, the women camp it up in long white lace dresses for a photo that goes with the notes, and paper dolls with clothes are included for those into that sort of thing.<br /><br />This perfect CD should belong to everyone who loves beautiful music.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|DIANA IS BACK ON TOP FORM. WONDERFUL SINGING AND PLAYING.GREAT ORCHESTRA AND ARRANGMENTS. VERY ATTRACTIVE COVER TOO.ENJOY!
0553801503|3.0|I still have great memories of when I was first introduced to this series. Storm of Swords had just come out, and I spent a couple of weeks racing through all three books as fast as I could. Ever since then, between re-reading the books and incessantly checking GRRM's  website, I've been waiting with millions of other fans across the world for the next volume of this epic tale. And after tearing through the book, all I can say is that reading a Feast for Crows turned out to be like eating a salad for dinner...tasty, but not really satisfying.  <br /> <br />It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is wrong with this book. The punchy, detailed prose that characterizes all of GRRM's writing is still there. The memorable characters (GRRM is the master of moral ambiguity) amd well-written lines are still there. And the many kingdoms of Westeros are so richly imagined that I seriously often forget that they are not real places. Yet, still, in terms of real plot, there just isn't much substance to this book. <br /> <br />OK I understand that this is the \\"rebuilding process\\" after the carnage of the wars. I understand that not every book can kill off 10 leading characters. A good story isn't defined by how many hairpin twists it takes, I understand that. Yet, it seems pretty obvious to me that this book was not edited well. Brienne's viewpoint, all 100+ pages of it, could have been cut without doing anything to the story. What was the point of the Samwell chapters, did they do anything? And I sincerely hope that GRRM knows what he is doing adding all these new viewpoints, because this series is teetering on the brink of unwieldiness (can it really be finished in 7 books? A 70 page appendix?).  <br /> <br />I will mark this book down as a slight misstep, and trust in the judgment of GRRM as he has obviously shown his talent in the past. Enjoy the Cersei, Jamie, and Arya viewpoints, digest the historical tidbits that help flesh out Westeros, and take this opportunity re-visit this compelling world. Just don't be surprised when you find your stomach grumbling after finishing.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to admit that I was very skeptical at the thought of  Madonna's release of a \\"dance\\"-type CD, as I am a bigger fan of her earlier stuff than her most recent compilations (i.e. American Life).  Boy was I wrong!  I am happy I went off of the other reviews on Amazon and by what others around me were saying by going out and purchasing it, this CD is truly terrific!  I have been playing it in my car for three days straight, it's great for lifting your mood and giving you a sense of renewed energy.  Shame on me for not thinking the Material Girl still had \\"it\\" in her, I am happy to say that I was proven wrong!
B000002UA0|4.0|This 1967 debut from Pink Floyd is not bad at all if you like this style of music and are in the mood. It's basically your late 60's underground British psychedelic blend of music from then genius and Floyd founder Syd Barret. Way before PF hit the BIG time with Dark Side, and way before Roger Waters went on his rampages and way before David Gilmour reached \\"Legendary\\" status, the band was started and dominated by a soon-to-be doomed but genius (considered by many) Syd Barret. His style of music is a far cry from what PF would become in about six years, but is treasured by many die-hard PF fans. So give this album a try with an open mind and don't expect your \\"typical\\" Floyd sound. But however different it may be, it still has it's high-points and is a great debut from ONE of the GREATEST bands of all time. Give it a shot- you just may be happy you did.
B00005UKE0|3.0|Yagh this is definatly the best album put out by Goerge in his solo career.  I just wish on the song my sweet Lord he was sining about Jesus and not Krishna.  Geroge is a grreat guitarist and his career with the Beatles is far better than anything solo. GodBless
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album makes me feel something new and something old.  It brings me back to the days when people actually danced.  When people actually appeared to be happy on the dance floor.  It gives off a totally happy vibe which you can't find in most of our music or on the dancefloor these days.  Madonna has always been one to re-invent herself but I don't think she's done that at all in this album.  She took her roots...the music that got her started and added a little sugar and electricity to it.  I've been there from the beginning of her career on the charts and although I've always loved her, I love her even more now for giving me back that FEELING.  I feel happy every time I listen to this CD..it's turning me into that weird guy driving down the road and dancing his ass off and singing while I'm driving.  I must confess it's been too long since anyone has created a carefree dance CD that's not all hip-hop or bump and grind.  There's no aggression or depression to be found here if you are looking for someone or something to relate to your sadness(for those of you who would prefer to #$%$# about this CD), but if you just want a happy carefree vibe I recommend buying this CD. It's totally catchy and don't be surprised that you are bouncing to it at the most odd moments. <br /> <br />Oh and for those happy people out there...My favs are hung up, sorry, and jump.....Well the whole album is my favorite these days....what can I say...I'm a dancefloor queen who misses the old days....when people actually danced and had fun... <br /> <br />\\"EAT YOUR HEART OUT DEPRESSION JUNKIES\\"
B000002KHY|5.0|This is just a very good album to have and it,s great music.  Yesterdays music is so much better than todays death meatl hardcore rap.  GodBless
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I'm not going to let all of the negativity spoil my excitement for Mariah's re-release. As someone who purchased \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" the first time, I don't feel cheated or betrayed by this re-release. In fact, I've been looking forward to it for months. I love all of the 4 new songs. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is another classic Mariah Carey ballad. \\"Makin' It Last All Night\\" reminds me of \\"Sweetheart\\" from her #1's album. \\"So Lonely\\" with Twista is a great song as is \\"The We Belong Together Remix.\\" The reason why I prefer the re-release better is because the 4 new tracks add a little more bounce to the album. I like the fact that the last 3 tracks are danceable songs, they're groovier, you can bop your head along with them. And personally, since I don't spend a lot of time watching MTV's TRL, I'd rather have the videos from this album on DVD. This re-release turned out to be better than what I actually expected. I'm impressed by the DVD. They didn't have any of the extra songs or videos prior to the original release. If they did, they would have released it as a DualDisc the first time as many artists have been doing now. Mariah is 15 years into her career. So if she wants to re-release an album for the first time, I'm not complaining. So many other artists have done it with the result not being anywhere as good as this one. In conclusion, I can only  give my highest recommendation for this product.
B000AP04NI|2.0|This is a review of only the Todd-AO version of the movie included in the recent 50th anniversary edition of Oklahoma. The main Cinemascope version on Disc One is outstanding and deserves 5 stars and more. However the accompanying Todd-AO version on Disc Two looks abysmal in comparison.     For those who are unaware, the producers filmed two versions of Oklahoma simultaneously, the one commonly seen which is the Cinemascope version and the other, the Todd-AO version which is the one that Rodgers and Hammerstein preferred. It is seldom seen because theaters did not possess the special equipment to project these Todd-AO movies (extremely widescreen with curved edges to give an enveloping effect). The 2 movies are not the same. They did not just use different cameras or lenses to film the same scene. The films are different in that every scene is restaged specifically for either Cinemascope or Todd-AO. This is obvious in a side by side comparison - the individual scenes are subtly different. Some scenes are shot at slightly different angles, some scenes are shot at different times of the day, some scenes include cast members seen in one version but not the other while all scenes show subtle variations in performances between one version and the next. But the most obvious difference is that only the Todd-AO version includes the Oklahoma Overture as well as the Intermission, En'tracte and Finale (Exit Music) which Richard Rodgers wrote for Oklahoma but never included in the Cinemascope version. The end result is that the Todd-AO version runs for 147mins while the Cinemascope version runs for just 139mins, a fact that Fox fudges by giving the runtime of the movie as 145mins.    The Todd-AO version presented here is virtually unrestored. It is so dark you can barely read the opening credits. It is grimy. Todd-AO is shot on 70mm film (Cinemascope is on 35mm), so it should reveal exquisite detail. Instead the transfer is so soft and blurry, it is like watching a second-generation VHS tape. And although Todd-AO is shot at 30fps, as opposed to 24fps in standard film, for the express purpose of reducing film flicker, there is more flicker on the Todd-AO transfer than on the main Cinemascope version. This is a very sorry presentation of what should have been the definitive edition.    If you are buying this solely for the Cinemascope version, you won't be disappointed. It is indeed a sight to behold. If you are thinking of buying this for the Todd-AO version which few audiences today would have had the chance to see, I'd recommend waiting till Fox reissues a properly restored edition of it. In fact the Todd-AO version looks better on the old laserdisc from more than 10 years ago.       A sidenote to Fox: Please do not harangue your customers with those extremely loud, obnoxiously noisy anti-piracy messages placed at the front of all your DVDs. People who buy these DVDs are not the ones pirating your movies. I inserted this DVD into the player expecting to be greeted by the lovely music of Oklahoma only to be assailed by the abrasively loud banging, thumping and thudding of your aggravatingly annoying anti-piracy message. Do not punish your legitimate customers or you'll find us all going to the side of the pirates.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Gladiator Extended Edition. <br /> <br />First, if you are considering this DVD and you don't have DTS ignore all the whining by the DTS crowd. While its disappointing it is not there. It doesn't destroy the set. Especially, keep in mind the majority of us don't have 1000 dollar audio setups to enjoy the DTS sound. Its a minority all in a hoot on this one. <br /> <br />As for the film - its a improvement. Many have said it, so I'll be succinct. The added character development (Lucilla, Politics, Proximo and Commadus' scene in the basement) all augment the characters wonderfully.  <br /> <br />So, without recycling other viewpoints? If you are a fan of this film, more than likely you'll find the Extended Edition enjoyable as well.  It takes what you saw in theatrical release and adds a layer or two in spots. Thats a welcome addition to me. <br /> <br />Only downside - if this was to augment the original DVD release why include the theatrical release again? Space used for the Theatrical release could've been use more wisely. They should've just made this Extended Edition only. <br /> <br />Other than that, great movie - added scenes for the most part add to my enjoyment of the film.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|In this spectacularly terrible flick the director puts his characters on a rollercoaster ride through a cardboard version of what hell is supposed to be like when people envision it when they are about 12 years old, and in one hand the director holds a knife putting it on the viewers' throats warning them to \\"Really get shocked now, OR ELSE...\\" and his other hand is on his crotch, masturbating over how he thinks he knows a thousand ways to traumatize the masses into addoration...the only thing that shocks me here is how he actually manages to get the masses on their knees, scary!
B00005JXY3|4.0|Karate Kid II.    Such division in the views on this movie. Chalk me up as one who loved this one. I'll go as far to give it a notch up on Karate Kid I.    Several reasons for my views on this. One - Additional depth of the characters. I love that Mr. Miyagi is the center of the story. The movie gave him a back story and explained him much more. It humanized him. Second - It isn't all about Laruso. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the first film and its themes. It was brillance on the part of the writers make Laruso a secondary character to Miyagi in this one. Third - the themes are intact and expanded upon (honor, loyality, love etc) others have mentioned it. I whole heartidly agree.    On the sappy front I love Daniel's relationship with Kumiko. It was touching and felt much more honest and real opposed to Daniel's love intrest in I. Too bad Kumiko didn't return for III. Could've been some nice development there.    In regards to the acting - Its very good contary to some others opinons expressed here. The only exception being Miyagi's father's death scene. I thought the \\"death\\" was the only weak acting point. The scene is good, just the actor who played Miyagi's father I think overplayed the death. Other actors peform well.    Overall, this film avoids the cliches and trappings of sequels. It develops the characters and shows you new sides to them. It also keeps the themes intact of the original.    This film still holds up well. Its a bit different in that it doesn't play the bullying card the way the first movie does. It isn't just about Daniel and winning respect. This one is about support and love to a friend and mentor in his time of need.     A wonderful sequel that has earned its spot next to I.    Highly recommended.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|There are a precious few artist/musicians who can claim to have remained valid for forty years. Bob Dylan is one, Van Morrison another. Perhaps the same can be said for Paul McCartney, but of this list, it is arguable that Neil Young did the best job of remaining relevant for most of that time. His music has accompanied me throughout my life, and with \\"Prairie Wind,\\" it appears as though that journey is bound to continue.<br /><br />\\"Prairie Wind\\" is about reflecting on old times, and acknowledging the importance of good friends, family, and time well spent. Listening to this album is like getting a letter from an old friend who you haven't heard from in a few years. The reminiscent tone is immediately familiar and deeply touching, especially as he discusses old memories from the perspective of a person who wants to communicate thoughts that may have gone unspoken, as in \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\"; \\"It's such a precious thing, the time we share together. I must apologize for all the troubled times.\\"  Philosophically speaking, it is pretty much true that most of us do not get to really know many people - In a lifetime, we might claim a few family members and a handful of friends as truly close. Young suggests this himself in the song \\"The Painter,\\" when he sings \\"I have my friends eternally, we left our tracks in the sound. Some of them are with me now, some of them can't be found.\\"<br /><br />Over the course of his career, Neil has often confounded the public by constantly changing directions, including a few chameleonic shifts in style. However far he wanders, though, he eventually returns to his roots as a reflective country-folk artist. In that sense, \\"Prairie Wind\\" was inevitable, and it is welcome because it allows Neil Young to be extremely honest with himself and with his audience, at a time when honesty is a very rare commodity. \\"Prairie Wind\\" is the most reflective album in Neil Young's entire catalogue, with many songs that are culled from old memories and which then evaluate how well his time has been spent. Perhaps the album's centerpiece is a track entitled \\"It's a Dream.\\" It starts with Young comforting a loved one after a bad dream, and then drifts into a dreamlike vision of a young boy fishing by a river piling. The next verse conjures an old man who watches as a train pulls away from the station and vanishes in the distance. Each time, he concludes with a chorus that states \\"It's a dream. It's only a dream, and it's fading now, fading away...just a memory without anywhere to stay.\\" The emotional effect of these words is deeply sad, and yet it is simultaneously comforting, telling us that in the end, we are left with our memories, and even these fade away from us, so it is good to acknowledge those who have shared their time with us.<br /><br />The great illusion of pop culture is how it deceives us into believing that we actually know the artist. Unless it's abused, I don't think that's a bad thing. We listen closely while they share their innermost thoughts in an eloquent, artistically appealing song. We interpret their words, relate to them, and develop a sense of familiarity that in some ways transcends many `flesh and blood' relationships. Over the course of four decades, I have come to feel as though I genuinely know Neil Young, and \\"Prairie Wind\\" does nothing to dispel that notion.<br /><br /> A-  Tom Ryand which then evaluate how well his time has been spent.

B000AU9UYM|2.0|*snort* Oh please. People really need to go THINK about something for five minutes before they wax philosophical about something like this movie. *whooosh* Batman swoops in. *Whoosh* Batman swoops out. And all the 14-year olds in the movie theatre (Even the ones that are certified public accountants) go \\"COOL!\\".  <br /> <br />Somehow, no matter how much psychobabble they try to slap on top, and no matter how many Pseudo-Literati Youngin's trying out the skills they learned in their first English lit class talk about it, they'll never quite manage to cover the fact that this is a movie about a DUDE that wears a costume with BIG RUBBER MAN MUSCLES (nipples included) and BAT EARS on it. WHY would I be interested in what this fellar has to pontificate about while he kicks people and shoots at things and drives around in computer-generated gadgets? THE DUDE IS WEARING BAT EARS AND RUBBER MUSCLES. <br /> <br />Did Chuck Norris star in this movie? I couldn't quite tell. There was so much posturing and mooning around in costumes that Orville Redenbacher could have been Batman and I wouldn't have noticed. In fact, given the aforementioned RUBBER MAN MUSCLES, Orville Redenbacher COULD have been Batman.  <br /> <br />This was an unimaginative, uninteresting rehash of a movie. The philosophy was suitable for NFL voiceovers, and the action mostly revolved around explosions and swooping. If this is what people think it is to be a MAN, no wonder we've got so many fools running around our country. You know who was a MAN? Gandhi was a man. Poundmaker was a man. Kierkegaard was a man. Zeno was a man. The Apostle John was a man. Being a 'Man' isn't a function of the size of your muscles or the amount of butt you can kick. If you think it is, you need to turn off the media boxes you're intravenously connected to and go do something with yourself. <br /> <br />2 Stars - one because I have to give everything AT LEAST one star, and one because I laughed at the man muscles. <br /> <br />Asa matter of fact, I may go into the rubber man muscle business - it may be a bright new industry. Any investors out there?
1573301183|5.0|Which isn't on this collection, but then some  songs wouldn't translate to an unplugged perfomance.  The most amazing contradiction to this was \\"Would?\\", which absolutely rocks both on Dirt and on this DVD!.  All songs are great, though you can see Layne fading away and screwing the the lyrics on \\"Sludge Factory\\".  Layne, RIP.  Jerry Cantrell is the leader of this group that by this time had Mike Inez as the bass player.  Who's the drummer again?  My wife says he's one of the best drummers around.  What does she know???  Yeah, ok, he's good.  This DVD rocks, its a must have, even if you aren't a metal head.  what the hell is a metal head anyway?  This is just damn good music...  Oh yeah, I forgot, I'm a metal head.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I've read a lot of the over 400 reviews about this movie on Amazon.  The bottom line is some people love this movie and some people hate it.  Personally, this is actually my favorite movie of all time (and that's saying a lot because I've seen a lot of movies).  But it is a make-you-think movie that touches on a number of dark realities of the lives that many people live.  If you're the kind of person that does not like seeing any darker side of life at all then this is not the movie for you.  Having said that, this is definitely the movie for you if you're like me and have always thought how your life could be completely different if a few things in your past had been different.   <br /> <br />Before seeing this movie I was not a big fan of Ashton, but after seeing this movie I have gained a new respect for him (even though I still hate Punked).  One more thing, watch the theatrical version first.  It is by far the better ending.

B000B5IPLK|1.0|I have her first 2 CDs.  This one has been in my shopping carts for weeks now.  I kept putting off my purchase because of the [copy-protected] heading.  However, I thought it would be like previous CDs where certain tracks hissed when copied.  That would be inconvenient because I couldn't have a copy in my car, but it wouldn't be the huge deal it's turned out to be.  The copy protection is actually a hidden program that's installed on your PC whether you accept or reject the license agreement (EULA).  This is bad because 1) it's done w/out your permission and 2) creates an exposure that hackers have already exploited.  [...] contains details and steps to manually remove the software.   <br /> <br />I understand the need to protect your investment, but this is not the right way to do it.  I think I'm done purchasing CDs anyway.  It doesn't appear they try to have a great CD.  They go with 4-5 good songs (if you're lucky) and the rest are just filler.  From now on, I'll download the tracks I like and make my own CDs.   <br /> <br />As for her voice, she sounded great on Good Morning America.  She might have been hoarse when she did Unplugged.  Record companies, managers, etc. say 'the show must go on' but I'd prefer they reschedule instead of sounding like crap.  I haven't heard this CD in it's entirety, so can't comment on her vocals.  The \\"1\\" is for the copy protection crap.
B0007OASII|5.0|First off, as a singer myself, I had to laugh at the user who commented that Khan has a bad voice; they must not sing. <br /> <br />Now onto the ratings.  In the past, I admit it, I'd listen to Kamelot for Roy Khan's awesome vocals.  I then got a hold of this album and realized for the metal idiom, it is a very very good album.  I very much enjoyed all the songs on this album and would recommend it to anybody who's not afraid to listen to some metal.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|You've got to hand it to Warner Bros.; they finally got it right.  With Memento director Christopher Nolan at the helm, Batman is finally given the right treatment that the classic DC Comics icon has deserved as Nolan and co-screenwriter David Goyer take the Dark Knight back to his roots.  There's no major celebrity villains that take up most of the film, there's no fourescent colors, there's no Bat-nipples, and there's no Robin; this is the way Batman should be.  Christian Bale wonderfully cast as the brooding Bruce Wayne, searching across the world for a means to battle crime as he is haunted by the death of his parents.  He meets a man named Ducard (Liam Neeson), who trains him and offers him a place in the League of Shadows led by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  After a spectacular action sequence, Bruce returns to the crime ridden Gotham City which is under the fist of crime lord Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson); and with the assitance of his faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine, perfectly cast), technical genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and honest cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, wonderfully cast against type), Batman is born.  Unlike the other Batman films, Batman Begins really gets to the heart and soul of the character, and Bale couldn't be better as the Dark Knight.  The cinematography is superb, the fight scenes are nicely orchestrated, and the rest of the cast is great as well, including Cillian Murphy who is perfectly creepy as the vile Scarecrow.  The only weak point of Batman Begins is Katie Holmes as the Gotham DA/love interest, but her she doesn't have a significant amount of screen time.  All in all, Batman Begins is a magnificent return to form for the character, and it's one of the best comic to film adaptations ever.
0684833395|3.0|I guess yu can say that I started this book with high expectations. From what I read and heard, this is considered to be a masterpiece. I began with the preface and all Heller does is praise his book and he goes on to tell us-the readers just how well the book did.I didn't like being confused more than half the time. I must admit Catch 22 had its moments where I laughed, but it doesn't make up for all the other chapters where I was left scratching my head. I did admire Heller's choice of descrition of his well illustrated characters, but I felt that all the story did was drone on.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is by far the best Batman movie I've ever seen.Christian Bale was the right choice to play the Caped Crusader.The writing and the stunt work was very good.I am not taking anything away from Michael Keaton's perfomance as Batman,but Liam Neeson deserve a Oscar for his performance.I can't wait for the sequel.
B000068R1X|4.0|After the huge loss of Randy Rhoads in a plane accident, Ozzy was able to find a worthy replacement in Jake E. Lee. Jake had played briefly in Ratt (and Rough Cutt I believe) before teaming up with Ozzy. I have great memories of getting this on cassette for Christmas in 1983. The album kicks off with the title track Bark At The Moon. Jake's rhythm playing is tight and the solo is well-constructed. The video for this song was classic featuring Ozzy in a full werewolf costume! The next song, Now You See It, is a decent song but after that the album hits a low point with You're No Different. This song is quite bland and should have been kept off the album. But the album gets right back on track with probably my favorite track, Rock N Roll Rebel! Great riff, great lyrics, great vocals, and several cool lead breaks from Jake. The next song, Centre Of Eternity, features a cool gothic intro with a bell tolling, monks singing, and a church organ. The riff is pretty good and the chorus is catchy. Jake plays another great solo. Next is the album's ballad, So Tired, not bad but a little too sappy for my tastes. Ozzy sounds whiney telling us how tired he has become. After that is Slow Down, a good rock song with a catchy chorus and yet another great solo section from Jake! The album closes with the haunting Waiting For Darkness. This song is a slow paced gem that features great emotional vocals from Ozzy. The re-issue features the song Spiders. I think this song would have been a better choice than You're No Different even though it doesn't quite fit the rest of the album. All in all a good debut album for Jake! I put this album just after the two Randy Rhoad's studio albums.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|This movie is a work of pure comic genius, from an unexpected source! Who would have expected a Chinese director to come up with a Warner Bros.-style, Kung Fu, live action cartoon? Not me! Stephen Chow has OBVIOUSLY spent some time either in Hollywood, or in a history of film class drinking in the work of Tex Avery and Robert Clampett! This movie is a HOWL! Imagine if you will, (submitted for your approval,) The Zucker Bros. or pre-\\"High Anxiety\\" Mel Brooks getting a hold of a troupe of Chinese kung fu actors and using every \\"Looney Tunes\\" gag they can think of to milk the laughs for everything they're worth!<br /><br />Stephen Chow has all the earmarks of a master of kung fu slapstick, something this country hasn't really ever seen before. Aside from the great sight gags, he has also assembled a real soupcon of characters, from Rabbit-Tooth Jane, an unusual girl to say the least, (she acts VERY effeminate and has a look I really haven't seen in oriental women before,) to the bossy, battle-axe landlady, who also happens to be a dormant kung-fu doyenne, to her husband, a fellow, middle aged kung fu master, to a sweet, mute, Japanese-looking girl who sells ice cream. There are others, too numerous to mention here, without tiring you out!<br /><br />The director himself is the hero of the film, and he goes from being a sleazy, gangster wannabe to being a deadpan kung fu messiah during the course of the movie. One hilarious scene, while he is still a sleazebag, is when he tries terrorizing a poor community that has managed to avoid the wrath of an evil cabal called the \\"Axe Gang\\", in order to IMPRESS said gang. He calls for a challenger to step forward and to take him on, and he warns them \\"No cheating!\\" He calls on a humble lady farmer and dares her to hit him in the stomach, which she does, doubling him over immediately. Recovering from that, he starts picking at random...first a fella he refers to as \\"Shorty\\", who turns out to be about 7 feet tall when he stands up from his sitting position. After reminding the crowd \\"No cheating!\\", he then calls out a mousy looking guy with glasses, asking him to step forward. He does so, exposing a physique all out of character to his nerdy face. He then scans to what looks like a seven year old boy, who steps out, ALSO revealing a Charles Atlas-like upper torso! Fed up, (and completely cowardly,) he moves on.<br /><br />There is one very poetically done scene involving two hitmen who don't work in the ordinary way...and this is where a major fantasy element joins the cartoon zaniness: In the still of a nearly cloudless night, two assassins hired by the Axe Gang seek to take out the brave inhabitants of Pig Sty Village, who have stood up to their terror. These assassins use a long, autoharp-type instrument to strum out very sino-fiendly chords that somehow manage to produce lethal weapons and figures out of thin air. They set these against the tailor, the baker and the landlady, the tailor and the baker having surprised you earlier with their kung fu expertise...with images of flying sabers, armored zombies and spears. The landlady manages to take them out with her patented \\"Lion's Roar\\", sending them whee-wee-wee, all the way home!<br /><br />If you buy but ONE kung fu movie in your life, make it this one!

B0000039QA|5.0|Biggie, Pac, who cares, it is all about good music, and both released some exceptional albums.  As for Life After Death, I don't like it as much as Ready To Die, but there is no doubt that it is still an absolute classic.   <br />I like Big's humor:  For example, the ending to N*ggaz Bleed, the start of Nasty Boy, Brooklyn's Finest (from Reasonable Doubt, Jay-Z). <br /> <br />Long Kiss Goodnight is an ok diss song toward 2pac, but the whole yo yo yo yo yo yo is somewhat annoying.  Also, Puffy sounds a bit funky yelling. <br /> <br />The entire album is a classic, some of my favs are: Somebody's Gotta Die, N*ggaz Bleed, Miss U, Going Back To Cali, Ten Crack Commandments, You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills you).
B000002UAO|3.0|This is actually a pretty good album by the Beatles.  But they have a LONG way to go before they can be respected like the Backstreet Boys, who are much better.  Lennon and McCartney's songwriting can best be described as competent if cliched, but George Harrison's use of that sitar gets annoying real fast.  I'd say after a couple more albums, these guys will be as good as the Backstreet Boys.  But they have a LOT of work to do if they want to achieve that level of greatness.

B000AP04NI|5.0|UPDATE:  My review was based on the HORRIBLE DVD set... the new BLU RAY is absolutely amazing and the TODD AO Version smokes the BR of the Cinemascope version.... I am choosing to leave the rest of the review intact as Amazon.com will apply it to everything with Oklahoma in the title and it still stands not only for the DVD set BUT... the DVD that comes with the recent Blu Ray still stinks... they did not upgrade the DVD version of Oklahoma when they found the new elements and upgraded the Blu ray discs.... so... If you are looking for a review of the Blu Ray... it's 5 stars... the DVD is 1 star and that review and comments follow...      I am happy to see a bunch of other folks were as horribly dissapointed as I  was to throw  this DVD into the player and instead of being treated by what should be a breathtakingly sharp and stunning Todd-AO version on disc two....see a muddy mess...which isn't near the 35mm version on disc one!    Fans of the Todd-AO process (watch Patton some time folks) know what an absolutely unsurpassed format it was....and the DVDs that have come out (like the aforementioned PATTON) that have been taken from  it stun with clarity and  color...  I don't know  how  many generations removed from the  original disc 2 of this set is  ....but its not  worth a $50 DVD players time...    Its particularly ironic that 20th Century waste so much other space on the disc on short features extolling the virtues of Todd-AO...only to present such a garbage transfer....  SHAME ON YOU FOX....this should be as gorgeous as the Sound of Music ...and its a big big letdown....and I like many others have been counting the  days for this release...    ....I am updating this review...with the official excuse from FOX home Entertainment...which follows..    A STATEMENT FROM TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT REGARDING THE  50TH ANNIVERSARY DVD EDITION OF RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN'S \\"OKLAHOMA!\\"    In recent days we have heard back from a small number of consumers  regarding the DVD of the Todd-AO version of \\"Oklahoma!\\" and specifically  that it appears less detailed than the old Fox DVD release from 2000. We  feel it is very important that we communicate the issues on hand  regarding the Todd-AO version of the film.    As you know well, director Fred Zinnemann filmed \\"Oklahoma!\\" using two  separate film techniques. The 35mm CinemaScope version and the then new,  large gauge 65mm film format called Todd-AO.    Firstly, the good news is that the first disc features the CinemaScope  version of the movie for the first time on DVD, and looks superlative.  This is the main feature of the new 2-disc Anniversary edition.    However, when it comes to the bonus disc featuring the Todd-AO version,  we have received reports from concerned fans that the Todd-AO version  looks 'fuzzy' or 'less detailed' than the old DVD release from 2000. How  can that possibly be?    When \\"Oklahoma!\\" was first released on DVD in 2000 it was the relative  infancy of DVD, and Twentieth Century Fox utilized a widescreen video  transfer of the Todd-AO version that had been made for VHS and laserdisc  back in 1994. The resulting widescreen transfer (with black bars top and  bottom) was a very pleasing presentation of the Todd-AO version.    Now, in 2005, Fox DVDs are mastered for the highest quality, supporting  widescreen TVs and HDTVs that feature a 16x9 screen format (as opposed  to 4x3 TV format). We could not simply re-use the old 1994-vintage 4x3  video transfer of the Todd-AO version because on an HDTV the old format  would reveal ugly video artifacts, anomalies and edge enhancement that  would detract from the film. This would be immediately apparent on any  widescreen standard definition TV and more so on a high definition TV.    That being decided, it was back to the IP of the Todd-AO version for an  all new high-definition transfer.    This is where time plays a detrimental role in the process. The Todd-AO  print had severely deteriorated since the 1994video transfer and  presented a nightmare for the authoring of the DVD.    A painstaking restoration of the original elements was undertaken. The  negative was so damaged that a 'wet gate IP' had to be created in order  to preserve the film source. The biggest problem inherent in the Todd-AO  version is the appearance of soft focus and considerable color  breathing. The digital restoration team agonized over using the right  amount of dirt removal ('DRS') in order to remove the glue stains and  tears, while still trying to keep the already soft image from getting  any softer. They addressed the color breathing as well, but too much  adjustment would ultimately further harm the video presentation by  introducing ringing and aliasing caused by artificially sharpening the  picture.    Indeed, if you look at the 'Auctioning Ado Annie' scene (chapter 30) on  the Todd-AO DVD, you can still see very severe color-flashing on the far  left side of the frame. So sever was the flashing that no amount of  digital correction would help.    The process of restoring a poor element is a difficult one, and Fox  stands by its decision to give accurate representations of source  materials. While artificial edge enhancement fixes one problem, it  actually introduces more problems.    Ultimately, the decision was made to allow the DVD to present the  Todd-AO version as accurately as it can be without artificially making  it appear sharper.    In 1954/5, \\"Oklahoma!\\" was the first studio feature film to utilize the  new Todd-AO process, and as such, the movie was a shake out for the  system. Todd-AO lens and equipment were retro-fitted to existing camera  technology, which resulted in anomalies that would prove significantly  challenging some 50-plus years later in the digital age. By the time of  \\"Around the World in 80 Days,\\" released nearly two years later, the  Todd-AO process was significantly more stable.    Sadly, in this day of high definition programming and movies, the  currentTodd-AO print of \\"Oklahoma!\\" does not stand up to scrutiny of  what we think a large format film should look like. It simply isn't as  sharp or as detailed as we remember it being. And it certainly doesn't  compare to today's high definition programming.    So while the CinemaScope version is stunning, the Todd-AO version of  \\"Oklahoma!\\" confounds DVD fans and aficionados 50 years after it was  created.  It may indeed suffer by comparison, but is, in its own right,  a good transfer given today's technology.

You have proved the haters wrong with a string of hit singles, multiplatinum albums, a GRAMMY, a loving husband, and a healthy baby boy.  These hits prove what a legend you are, and I am so proud of you!      As for the rest of you, if you skip this album in favor of a classic rock release, you don't deserve respect.

B00005214X|5.0|This is George's first real solo album (not counting the electonic cds)and he aptly demostrates that he had the keenest musical ear of all the Beatles, he has blues (the Jams)country tinged rock Behind that Closed Door,rock/pop in My Sweet Lord,heavier rock in songs like Wah Wah ,Let it Down. A keen sense of spirituality embodies the music . This remastered is excellent,the wall of sound is there as it should be. I never was a big Beatle fan only owning Let It Be and Abbey Road however I have heard all of their music and George's always stood out. I don't mean to diminish the other Beatles as they did write some great songs towards the end of their career. Solo however only John comes close to George. Paul is just to damn sweet musically alot of his material sounds as if it were written for children (think of the Ram Cd).The musicianship is outstanding on this cd and it definitely is one of the best 100 cds made. This is a must have. Clapton along with Dave Mason are given credit as guitarist along with Badfinger (strictly rythmn). Which outside of the jams where Eric can be clearly heard as the dominant lead, I have to wonder about the leads on the rest of the cd. George was an excellent lead guitarist and on some songs it is apparently him. If you have never heard this cd go and buy it. You will not regret it. Great songs with great hooks and leads,lots of melody and just listen to the lyrics and think about your own immortality.It is unfortunate that George passed away as the music world is missing one of heavens voices.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I am so happy for Michael Jackson.  He adores children, and he would never do anything to hurt a child in distress.  It saddens me that people think he's weird and evil.  He's a perfectly normal person.  And, best of all, he's been acquitted of ALL charges.  I'm sad to see that he'll no longer live in America, but that's our loss, not his.  We were unfairly cruel to him.  Back to the music.  It is awesome.  You're gonna love it!
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration was the Cure's first album I bought at its actual release - I was 12 and 16 years later I still see this album as the finest of the Cure's works. This album is probably among the finest works of the late 80's and is still totally listenable after all this time and is certainly shaping up to be a classic.  With HP using \\"Pictures of You\\" in their recent ad campaigns - this music is still relevant and what might have been extreme at release now finds its way into the mass marketplace.  <br /> <br />Deep and distant beats and the perfest use of Guitar keyboards and bass create a consistant soundscape throughout that is emotional yet not depressing.  Within this continuity there certainly are high points. These songs include \\"Fascination Street\\", \\"lullaby\\" and \\"Pcitures of you\\" The other tracks are also very good and overall I would relegate none of the tracks here to filler. This is an album that you can listen to straight through without boredom or the desire to skip tracks. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to any cure fans (of course) but also to fans of synth pop,Ladytron or anyone looking for a truly gratifying musical experience.  Time tryeth truth and the truth is this album is excellent and probably marks the Cure's finest moment.  <br /> <br />Ted Murena <br /> <br />
B0007XH5OY|5.0|If you want some insight into what fueled the \\"British Invasion\\" this is for you.  Young Brits took American blues, plugged it in, amped it up, and quite honestly, gave us back a new and improved version of our own idiom.  What an all-star lineup!  Beck is a monster, and never better.  Rod Stewart has that scotch-and-cigarettes rasp that fits the music exactly.  (Long before he fell victim to years of dreadful material).  For good measure, there's even Nicky Hopkins on the piano.  Lounge lizard nightclub electric blues supreme.  The U.K. version bonus tracks are fantastic, with only a couple of exceptions.  (The genius who included Love Is Blue needs to take a nap.)  Forget the wretched, self-indulgent excess of Led Zeppelin and their ilk.  This is the real deal.  And that's the truth.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's great to see so many fans enjoying this album.  While I admit I did enjoy American Life, I think \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a real winner.  Kudos to producer Stuart Price, who not only does a great job producing most of the individual tracks, but does a superb job mixing the album.  The album is non-stop energy and I like that the songs are not too long, but reasonable length just to keep the party moving along.  My favorite tracks include \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Get Together\\", \\"Future Lovers\\", \\"I Love New York\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\".  Madonna continues to excite and entertain, and I hope this album does well for her.    Madonna fans who have not paid much attention to her in recent years will enjoy this.   <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watch TV but had never even heard of this series, until an enthusiastic friend loaned me her DVD set and I put it on one night - amazingly, I have now become uncharacteristically obsessed with this show. It's incredibly, incredibly good! It's a western/sci fi so yes there's a lot of action, but it's also laugh out loud funny, poignant, romantic, and mysterious (it's also truly sexual and erotic occasionally). The characters are some of the best ever written for TV and the actors are just picture perfect in the roles. I cannot believe how likeable they are - all of them.     Much to my regret, I did not see Serenity in theaters because I totally missed the entire buzz surrounding this film and its Firefly background. Since I've become obsessed as I've said, I did some research on the web and it's clear that there is a huge following for Firefly, and within this set, Serenity was the event of the year. But I do not think marketing was done properly for this film outside of that group and now it looks like Serenity sadly has not done very well. Everyone hooked into the sci fi world knows about this show, but I think it needed to be marketed to a wider audience like me - someone who isn't necessarily a sci fi fan but who will devoutly watch a show with a great storyline, acting, poignancy and humor. The one good news about the film is that I think it brought more people to view the series DVD.    In any case, the question now is, how can this show be brought back? There is so much more great story-telling to be done for this series and it will be a TRAGEDY if it never gets told. So any creative ideas? If a network such as HBO or Sci Fi picks it up, I'd be willing to bet that millions of viewers will happily pay weekly/monthly fees to keep the show going (set up a special PayPal account?). Or alternatively, we can set up a special fundraiser and have all the fans chip in so that a check can be handed to a network as a down payment to pick it back up. I don't think I'mbeing Pollyannaish in saying that I think this can raise tens of millions of dollars. Firefly can be the first truly viewer supported series on TV. Over the years there have occassionally been new TV shows that got cancelled which I've liked.  I regretted them but got over it pretty fast.  Firefly is different. Something has to be done here....it simply cannot die like this...it's just too damn good.
B00008G9JO|4.0|This album deserves to be far better known and beloved alongside Tull's more straightforward rockers. It's a cohesive set of compositions performed with tight musicianship, wonderfully arranged, acoustic and electric beautifully balanced. 'No Lullaby' is a jarring inclusion—it's much &#34;heavier&#34; than the other songs, and outsized—but otherwise the songs are both satisfying in themselves and richly blend the genres they draw from, contemplative and wistful without veering into sentiment. The bass line in &#34;Journeyman&#34; and flute in &#34;One Brown Mouse&#34; are particularly striking. There's always potential for steeliness even when Tull is delicate, and when Martin Barre's guitar kicks in at the end of 'Weathercock' it makes nostalgia feel triumphant.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie is more than just another comedy vehicle for Bill Murray, it's a true diamond--a \\"point of light\\"--in the tradition of \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\"  This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder if maybe it wasn't inspired by angels instead of written by the usual Hollywood hacks.   <br />   There is a powerful lesson to be learned from this movie, and jerks who watch it (isn't there at least a little bit of jerk in all of us?) can actually learn two of the greatest lessons of life from this movie: 1) it's important not to be a jerk, and 2) how not to be one.   <br />   This movie is much more important than the casual viewer might think it is. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|She, once again, is stating what the whole world already know: She's the one to follow and the one and only Queen of Pop.  What a taste of it? Hear Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry and Forbidden Love from this album.  It just doesn't get any better.  Her best album, along with Like a Prayer and Ray of Light/Erotica.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|For the young, 47-year-old mother of two who also happens to write children's books, Madonna has left her imprint in the music world and beyond.  O.K., so her most recent recording \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" isn't going to exactly make music history.  But here is the point:  Madonna continues to make music that's hip and appeals to a cross-section of people, and she's doing it well into a period in her life where many artists have sputtered and gone into obsolescence.  Personally, I do not expect to hear Madonna of the 80s or 90s.  I want to hear the Madonna of today.  And here she is, making the dance world go 'round and 'round.  That's Madonna!  Amazing charisma, talent, and staying power, Madonna is #1!
B000A2H812|4.0|Ukranian Eastern European New York gypsy immigrant punk cabaret, sung in broken English by Eugene Hutz [who needs an exorcist] and played with ferocious intensity by his merry men and women.  The most thrilling CD I've heard all year - you'll be singing along although you'll have no idea exactly what you are saying.  My grade:  A
B000BI0WOA|5.0|At last, a Dire Straits compilation WITHOUT edits, which was why I found the 'Sultans of Swing' compilation disappointing.  And whatsmore the studio versions of all songs are on here - the superb 'Telegraph Road', 'Love Over Gold' in its original 6min format and all the rest that we know and love.  Even 'Money for Nothing' and 'Brothers In Arms' are in their full length versions.  All the better tracks from the 'Sultans' compilation are present - 'Sultans of Swing', 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Tunnel of Love'. <br />In 2CD form, the second CD is mostly Mark Knopfler's solo work and there is some good stuff here as well, especially 'Sailing to Philadelphia'.  An excellent compilation well worth buying, whether you're a fan or looking for an intro to this classic band and their legendary frontman.
0804106304|4.0|The power of storytelling is a very significant and prevalent theme in the Joy Luck Club, which is most likely used because of the barriers between Chinese and American cultures and language, poignantly evidenced in the stories of mothers and daughters.  Storytelling is used to communicate love, pride, self, history, and family history.  The exchanging of stories helps control fate as well, as mothers can encourage independence, forge identity, and yet retain their own legacy in their daughters' own lives. <br /> <br />Each vignette is a fascinating story in and of itself that weaves the reader into the created world and into the midst of four daughters and four mothers.  No one story is more or less important than another, and the structure of the interrelated stories is just as important as the voices in each tale.    There is a fascinating tension and bond in these relationships that will be heartwarming for mothers and daughters alike, and a compelling read for every one else.  Whether this book is a novel or a collection of stories is up for interpretation, but the accomplishment of Tan's writing is fairly recognizable.  Tan is an excellent story teller that has woven together a painful and beautiful picture of the poignant mother-daughter relationship, told through the lens of the dynamic Chinese-American culture.  Conflict, confusion, and delight abounds.
6302158249|3.0|This concert has its moments... I saw the group live in 1985 touring after 'Brothers In Arms' was released and that concert was definitely better than this one... also saw them live in 1988 with Eric Clapton. <br />On the debit side, Mark Knopfler's vocals are rather weak at times on 'Alchemy', and he has a tendency to change the lyrics. This version of 'Romeo And Juliet' is a stinker.  The best tracks by far are 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love' and most of all 'Telegraph Road'.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album proves Madonna is the coolest and brightest star in pop music, but she has proved that a million times before. Hell, she's the biggest star in music period, like it or not.  While it might borrow from the past Confessions is a very futuristic album, in my opinion.  It has great melodies and the production is perfect, just like it is on all of her albums.  The songs speak for themselves, and yes, they're THAT good.  It is so fun to see her come out time and time again with a different gimmick.  She is definately entertaining to watch.  Pick up this album as soon as you can, because it is probably the best album I've heard all year.  And it's an ALBUM....it's not a couple of singles and a bunch of filler material.  It's a proper album from start to finish.  Not many people do that anymore.    Favorite tracks:  Let It Will Be, Sorry, and Push.
B000B8QF14|4.0|The DVD plays on over 2 hours but only 65 minutes of that is music. What kind of concert DVD is this?<br /><br />Chocked full of the band talking about how amazing the album is, Billy Joe blurts \\"I'm the son of rage and love, the jesus of suburbia\\" \\"frightened\\" him? He was never so scared? I wondered how much crack he was smoking to be that afraid of some lyrics. The endless stutter that ensues over trying to describe how amazing the song was made me feel embarrassed for him. The interviews and backstage footage are largely forgettable back-patting spliced in no particular order (we see the set-up for the show half-way through the show) and spend most of it whishing they'd get back to the concert we paid to see.<br /><br />But where is the concert? They go on and on about these big shows, the 130,000 people in two days, etc., etc., but where are these shows? Lost in editing mostly. Three quarters of each show is cut out leaving us with only half a show in total. That half a show,  a mish-mash of fast cuts, black and white and widescreen - fullscreen innercuts that make you whished they'd format the thing to fit on one screen or the other.<br /><br />Don't blame Green Day, these guys work thier asses off on stage, blame the people who put the disk together. It's like the DVD is a promo to the live CD which is disappointing because they cut so much out but left 15 minutes of blank space. Better Live sets, Pearl Jam at Madison Square Garden, Sarah Mclachlan Mirrorball, Evanescence Anywhere But Here are everything this disk fails to be, a complete show experience.<br /><br />I really wanted to be able to stick this DVD in and get two hours of Green Day live and loud, but instead I got a high-school quality documentary spliced with some okay concert footage.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This CD is absolutely and hauntingly addictive! I believe this will be one of Madonna's greatest triumph to date.
0553573403|5.0|I'm giving this book five stars only because it is truly well written and I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. HOWEVER, after finishing this book, I can tell you I will never read any of his sequels. WHY? because I read fantasy fiction as a diversion from the treacheries of real life - to temporarily escape from a hardly perfect world. So while Martin is a great story teller, he reins his readers in with a swift slap-in-the-face reality check with a story that reads more like a historical account of life in the Middle Ages.<br /><br />It was childish, I know, but I was so disappointed in the book I tossed the book in the garbage can.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First off, I couldn't take it out of my bag, I have to play it in my car, at home, in my laptop. It's addictive! All of the songs are just mesmerizing, but GET TOGETHER and JUMP were phenomenal! I think GET TOGETHER alone is worth the price of the CD! I felt like being transported to a club everytime I listen to this music. Madonna, thank you thank you thank you!!!
B000059MEK|5.0|Okay, the fact that I am even writing this review surprises me a little because, I am a rock fan through and through. There as only been two other techno albums that have caught my attention like this before, \\"Legion of boom\\" and Dirty vegas's last one. So the fact that I stumbled acrossed this one and like it enough to write a review about it suprises me a little. I really think the appeal of this album is the fact that it is just fun. For some damn reason, I'm not sure why, they can get away with doing some of the weirdest crap that I have ever heard, and it comes acrossed interesting. I would definitly reccomend this if you are a club-hopper and like this kind of music, but I would even go so far as say that if you have an open enough mind to even look this up, at least pick up one of their albums, they're all good. Thank you for your time.
B00005RHF8|1.0|As a fan of the Bronte sister's writings and of George C.Scott's performances, it was a wonderful delight to see that the made-for-TV movie was actually on DVD.  As delighted as I was to find the movie, is as disappointed at watching this DVD.  The editing butchers the story line, complete chapters are missing, dialogue that moves the story along is omitted and it seems like miniplays with no connection but the characters.  DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. IT IS NOT WORTH EVEN A PENNY.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I know, a lot did this already but I have to make up something. Let me start off by saying that this idiot has overall a BAD taste in music, the only good bands he like are Rainbow and Black Sabbath. His favorite band is Helloween, who are a horrible overrated Iron Maiden rip-off who could be a good band if they had a little talent in their nuts but sadly they don't. Believe me, Pantera makes Helloween look like Simple Plan. Plus he spits on Metallica and Pink Floyd therefore what he says is unimportant.   Note for Pantera hater: Nobody likes or respects you and your dumb opinions. Take a loaded 9mm pistol and deliver 5 bullets to your head if you can survive the first (most likely not). Thank you.  Ignore Captain Flint and the kid above me, they are f**ktards as well, just some other Pantera hater's a$$kissers with big mouths, no balls and no life.    Back on the topic  This album is fantastic, it was released in 1990 which was fullof classics, Megadeth had 'Rust in Peace', Slayer had 'Seasons in the Abyss', Priest had 'Painkiller', Alice in Chains had 'Facelift' etc. This is also Pantera's first thrash metal album, they had in the 8o's 4 forgotten hairmetal albums ('Metal Magic, 'Projects In The Jungle', 'I Am The Night' and 'Power Metal'), which are even not available on Amazon.   Dimebag Darrell was no Jimi Hendrix or Eddie Van Halen he but still very good, he had cool riffs and solos. Rex Brown's basslines are completely audible unlike most thrash metal bands. Many people claim that Phil's voice sucked back then, I don't see whats wrong with it, his vocals are perfect in 'Cemetery Gates' and in 'Shattered' his voice sounds like Rob Halford (from Judas Priest). There are no filler tracks here. I'm still trying to decide if this or 'Vulgar Display of Power' is their best. Anyway the best songs are the title track, 'Cemetery Gates', Message in Blood' and 'The Sleep'.    Rest in peace Dimebag Darrell :'(    F**k off Pantera hater and all their haters around, as well the 2 morons above me. Like other person said I hope you all get shot just like Dimebag or the dumb f**k who shot him.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I already reviewed the original album, but i gotta say i love the new tracks and Bonus DVD......This is a perfect Gift for the Holidays, Mimi really brings it vocally and her songs are soooo good, hardly any filler on this album. The New single \\"Don't forget about us\\" is really chill love song, \\"So lonely\\" with twista is an awesome uptempo track with tight production from Dark Child and is gonna be the 5th and final single off the Re-release, \\"Make it last all night\\" featuring JD is also a good uptempo song, and last but not least \\"We belong together\\" remix with Jadakiss and Styles P. is one of my Fav remixes from her i love it. The DVD is well put together and u get all the Music video's from the era and u can watch the DFAU video on ur computer cause it's not on the DVD......Don't let the same J.lo fan who gave this album a ton of 1 star reviews discourage u for buying this, any R&B/Hip hop or Pop fan would appreciate this CD.
B000062YB1|4.0|Slayer started their golden era in 'Hell Awaits' and pretty much ended here, all their later releases were less succesful commercially. Although I think this album is somewhat overrated. I think their Latest album 'God Hates Us All' is superior to this, those who claim that album was a sellout can jump off a bridge. Many fans considering this to be Slayers ultimate album along with 'Reign in Blood'. I personally think 'Reign in Blood' and 'South of Heaven' blow this album out of water. RiB was perfect from the beginning to the end. SoH had one song that was decent but I didn't really like (Ghost of War). The reason I rate it 4 stars and not 5 is because I really see 'Expendable Youth' & 'Born of Fire' as 2 of the worst songs Slayer has ever done.    First it is a great album which contains many classics like the title track, 'War Ensemble' and 'Dead Skin Mask'. 'War Ensemble' has great vocals and cool riffs and solos, 3rd best Slayer album opener next to 'Angel of Death' and 'South of Heaven'. The title track is the longest song slayer put ou up to date although it is not that long (only 6:40), but the best on the album and IMO the 2nd best metal song of '90 (2nd to Judas Priest's 'Painkiller'). 'Dead Skin Mask' has maybe the greatest intro to a Slayer song and its has the best composition from the album. Plus the songs here are longer than the Slayer songs on other albums. But I feel the guitars are are less complex than in RiB and SoH, the riffs are slower (it doesn't mean bad). Other good songs here are 'Spirit in Black', 'Blood Red', and 'Temptation'. 'Hallowed Point' and 'Skeletons of Society' are only decent, they have good melodies and solos, but they aren't very memorable and have some weak vocals. The only 2 songs that I don't really like are as I said before, 'Expendable Youth' and 'Born of Fire', EY is being the better of them and is not that bad but annoying verses. BoF sucks because the guitars are boring and Tom's vocals are lame especially in the verses.    Overall recommended. But I suggest that you get 'Reign in Blood' and 'South of Heaven' or even 'God Hates Us All' first.
B0007GAERG|1.0|read the title and you can rate the album
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Maybe its the excellent plot ... brilliant characters & development ... great acting & chemistry amongst cast ... or maybe its just the first TV series to successfully combine a unique storyline with a carefully balanced mixture of humour, action, suspense, romance and a bunch of other wonderful stuff  <br /> <br />Absolutely the best Sci-fi/drama TV series ever !
B0000029GA|5.0|A hungry 19 year old Nas.  Everything on here is classic.  His rhymes, and beats from legendary producers.  This album set the standard for how rap music should be and still to this day, there is nothing like it.  I still love the Gap Band sample on \\"Life's a B!tch\\" featuring AZ.  It's a short and sweet album that is still classic.  It is Nas in his hungriest state, to claim the king of NY title, and this is why: <br /> <br />1)  NY state of Mind:  Classic <br /> <br />2)  Life's a Bitch:  Classic <br /> <br />3)  The World is Yours:  Classic and so is the video <br /> <br />4)  Halftime:  Classic (More kicks than a baby to a mother's stomach) <br /> <br />5)  Memory Lane:  Classic (Comin' out of Queensbridge) <br /> <br />6)  One Love:  Classic (prouduction by Q-Tip & a hook!!!) <br /> <br />7)  One time 4 your Mind:  Classic (Nasty the Villian) <br /> <br />8)  Represent:  Classic (straight ish is real) <br /> <br />9)  It ain't hard 2 tell:  Classic (Vocabulary spills i'm ILL+MATIC) <br /> <br />If anyone is a true hip hop head, you will OWN THIS........PERIOD.   <br /> <br />NO BOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTLLLLLLEEEEEEEGGGGGGGGGSSSSSSSSS  ALLOWED....PERIOD. <br /> <br />Best Nas CD.  10 mics!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Peace!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />

Our purpose is to keep Mariah, the biggest female musical icon of all time, on top.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the no-talent ****, Madonna, is still being referred to as the \\"Queen of Pop,\\" even though her most recent album, American Life, and her Reinvention Tour have really made her the \\"Queen of Flops.\\" Madonna used to be successful, but that's because she slept her way to the top. Mariah, on the other hand, has sold millions of records based solely on her amazing talents and being a great role model.  <br /> <br />Mariah has had sixteen number one singles. Her last two number one singles, \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" have broken worldwide records everywhere. Mariah's most recent Charmbracelet tour was a critically acclaimed smash that played to millions all over the world. Roger Friedman, a well respected music journalist, called the concert one of the greatest he's seen in the past ten years. Mariah is, indeed, the biggest musical sensation since the Beatles.  <br /> <br />Within the next couple months, Madonna will try to take away Mariah's crown by releasing \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" along with the single, \\"Hung Up.\\" There seems to be a lot of buzz , but most of it seems generated by Madonna's desperate, pathetic fans. TeamLamb will do everything we can to make this project a flop for Madonna. We will organize by calling radio stations and telling them how much we don't like her new songs, write letters to several magazines and confirm that she is, indeed, over, and spread negative messages about Madonna on several Internet blogs.
0553801503|4.0|I've been reading some of the negative reviews about \\"Feast\\" and I couldn't disagree more.  It is a really good book.  I think the problem is Martin set the bar so high with the first three, that people aren't going to be happy with anything he puts out.  <br /> <br />As far as the book goes, it does pick up right where \\"Storm\\" left off but only with half the characters.  It also introduces a couple new points of view such as the ironmen and the Dornish (which we knew very little about from the first 3 books).  When people say nothing happened in the book, I totally disagree.  The war is over so what did you expect?  Another huge war right away?  This book deals with the aftermath of the war and tries to show the desolation and the struggles of the people to deal with what has happened. <br /> <br />If you liked the first 3 books you should like this one.  I will admit that the end left me very curious about what is to become with Cersei and Brienne and I did not like they way the book left Arya.  I would also have liked to see more about Arienne and the rest of the people in Dorne and I will admit I'm a little confused about what is going on with the Hound. <br /> <br />All in all, it is a very good book that continues the story well (it is still some of the best fantasy around).   Is it as good as \\"Storm\\"?  Absolutely not, but you can't expect the story to stay that intense the entire time.

B00005JNEI|5.0|The movie was put together pretty well. I found it entertaining from begining to end. <br /> <br />Politically, you might either hate this movie and call it anti-US propaganda or you might decide you have a lot of questions about the US government and how fairly it governs us. The best way to watch this movie, i feel, is with an open mind. <br /> <br />Last time I watched this movie, I did so with a room of Staunch Democrats and Republicans. I can tell you it lead to a lot of interesting conversation afterwards. <br /> <br />Anyway, to conclude. It is well done, and entertaining. How you view the material is up to your idealogy and your open-mindedness.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is what it's all about people! This is what the \\"true blue\\" Madonna fans have been waiting for! Thank you, Madonna!<br /><br />Maddie has finally crawled out of the hole that she dug herself into! This album stands on it's own! Madonna has once again regained the attention of her original audience with this \\"dance\\" driven delight!<br /><br />\\"Confessions\\" is not your conventional \\"pop\\" album and it definatley isn't a straight up \\"dance\\" album either. There are a few songs (I Love New York) that are pretty \\"vapid\\" but ironically remain very very catchy. This album grows on you. I admit that I was very bitter after the atrocity that was \\"American Life\\" and was very skeptical of Madonna's future musical endeavors. But thank the Gods of Disco Heaven!!! Madge still has it in her!

B0000A7W14|4.0|What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is \\"I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job.\\" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, \\"I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too.\\" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how \\"real\\" Furious was. \\"Young\\" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today.

B00006F7S4|5.0|This was my first introduction to Beck (guess I got lucky). What a wonderful CD. I don't really need to add to the 100s of reviews for this CD. But...I will suggest people who like this take a listen to (early) John Martyn. Many reviewers have made the obvious connection between songs on Sea Change and those by Nick Drake, indeed the orchestration on several songs is obviously derived from Drake. But...John Martyn worked with Drake, was his friend and recorded with the same producers (early Island Records). If you love Sea Change listen to John Martyn's Solid Air (the song of the album's title is writen about the then dead Nick Drake) ...and for the ultimate break-up album \\"Grace & Danger\\". This album has songs of such intensity Martyn's record company refused (initially) to let him release it. It was ultimately released when produced by Phil Collins (yeah we won't go there), who'd also recently separated from his wife.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|When my fiance first told me about the term browncoats, I laughed because I had no clue what he was talking about.  And I never heard of the show.  And I watch more TV than him.  He tried getting me to watch the show a few times, but I was bored.  Needless to say he kept bragging about how we're going to see the movie the day it opens, etc..  I kept thinking \\"oh great\\" another Star Wars kind of movie.  But I was wrong.  This movie was excellent.  I even tried making myself not like it so he wouldn't see that I did.  But in the end, I thought it was excellent.  Not my type of movie, but very very good.  I actually wouldn't have minded seeing it again.  But shhh.. :)  And anyone can watch this and never have heard of the show.  It's realy easy to follow and everyone's idtenities are selfexplanatory, if they don't tell you in the movie.
B000003C4K|5.0|In my own little world this may be the single best album ever released, and it bothers me that so many reviewers feel the need to qualify their 5 stars with the THRASH label. Just as todays bands are jammed into little boxes marked \\"Grindcore\\" \\"Melo-Death\\" \\"Doom\\" etc, metal in the 80s was broken into ever fracturing sub genres. So Exodus was Thrash? So was D.R.I. and the two bands aren't exactly identical. Metallica was Thrash? What was Slayer? Was Dark Angel Death Metal? And can someone please get out the Brother P-Touch for DEATH Angel? <br /> <br />When describing any of these bands in the historical context of heavy music, labels are pointless. <br /> <br />Exodus was the best at what they did. For one monster of an album they had no equal. If there were no Exodus then . . . . make up you own dismal 311 or Audioslave populated future here. The California bands were so intertwined in the early 80s that one without the other could have meant the existence of none. And without them Gothenburg would still be a picturesque city where people eat meatballs and listen to nothing but Abba and Ace of Bass. <br /> <br />Bonded by Blood is one of the 5 most important heavy records ever made. You pick the other four.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Though Madonna previous album American Life flopped on sales on America, it did well in Europe and Asia where the singles of the album did fine and the remix album had solid sales. Now, Madonna did know what she did wrong on the last album. Politic shouldn't go on along with queen and her reing of dance pop music.  <br /> <br />Madonna's leadin' single 'Hung Up' is a song considered for critics 100% club party song. I really enjoy that she used the sample of Abba's Gimme Gimme Gimme but the lyrics on the song does't make justice to the sample. Hung Up profiles as a disco song with such potential and hability to be settin' on a DJ's session and fit just well. Now other songs like Sorry, Future Lovers and Get are exactly like that and keeps on movin' Madonna's style. Clubs wouldn't miss no single on this album for sure. <br /> <br />Now I enjoyed this dance anthem to glorify 70's and aswell Madonna's carrer (this should be called her reinventation) but I like most her pop albums. Dance sounds good on Madonna of course. Next album should be a remix album of this set single probably it would get re-released as the hit album on this years as part of marketing process and lookin' for more fat sales. <br /> <br />Madonna discover in this album a more undiscriminated and ambition music passion for oldies and bring them back alive as they were created on these era. But lyrically she remains the same (this isn't only my opinnion, this comes since the beginnin' of her career) that limit this album to be more excitin' and enjoy-able not only on the dancefloor. Guess it was just meant to be.  <br /> <br />Comparin' on other dance pop album this is outstandin' ok but not reachin' others like Kylie Body Language but gettin' close to it....
B000063DI9|5.0|THE BAND: Steve Harris (bass/keyboards), Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Nicko McBrain (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1988) 8 tracks clocking in at approximately 44 minutes. This is Maiden's 7th album. After releasing 3 in a row in the Bahamas, Maiden opted for a place closer to home - Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. The disc contains a 22-page booklet with a brief intro, lyrics, band pictures and thank you's. Song writing credits: Steve Harris has his name on 8 of the 9 songs; Dickinson co-writing 4, Smith co-writing 3. The enhanced CD features a nice multimedia section for your PC - including 2 videos (\\"Can I Play With Madness\\" and \\"The Evil That Men Do\\"), the band's catalogue of albums, band history, family tree, itinerary from the '88 Seventh Tour Of A Seventh Tour, and more. Digitally remastered in 1998. Cover art by the one and only Derek Riggs.<br /><br />COMMENTS: In my opinion, \\"7th Son\\" was the last great album the band put out before the original line-up got back together in 2000 for \\"Brave New World\\". Even though the synthesiser had emerged on \\"Somewhere In Time\\", the synth sound really came forward on \\"7th Son\\". I still have mixed feelings about the direction they went, but at the time, the sound was huge. I still prefer the stripped down guitars, bass and drums from their eariler albums. With that being said, \\"7th Son\\" still rocks the house. I rank it 4th in my Maiden catalog of albums - right behind \\"Piece Of Mind\\", \\"Number Of The Beast\\" and \\"Powerslave\\". I rate this album so high due to 3 of my favorite songs being here... \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" (though short at three-and-a-half minutes), \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", and perhaps my all-time obscure favorite \\"Moonchild\\". \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" was the band's highest charting single at the time - reaching #3 in the UK. \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" would wind up being the 2nd biggest single reaching #5 in the UK. The 9+ minute title song and \\"Only The Good Die Young\\" are classic Maiden rocking tunes as well. This is a concept album, a first for Maiden, following a mythical figure (the 7th son of a 7th son) who has special paranormal powers. As bassist Steve Harris notes on the disc, this is his favorite album. This is the last of the classic Maiden albums from the time when they ruled the heavy metal world. Great Disc.c Maiden rocking tunes as well. This is a concept album, a first for Maiden, following a mythical figure (the 7th son of a 7th son) who has special paranormal powers.

B00097DXZS|5.0|If you've been reading the news about the Sony recall of their spyware infested CD's, you'll see that the Santana album was not one of them.  This CD has anti piracy installed by Suncomm, not by XCP.  The XCP ones are the ones that had the Rootkit problem.  Since Sony does not have a deal with Apple to have their CD's played in iTunes, none of their titles that has any copy protection whatsoever will work there.  That doesn't mean that the Suncomm ones will infect your computer!  Hopefully, Sony will realize that if someone purchases their music, they have the right to listen to it on their computers and put it on to their iPods (or do whatever else they want to do with it once they own it).  For now, though, do what I do - buy it from iTunes, burn it to a disc and then listen on your iPod.  Not only is their no copy protection to worry about - at $9.99, it's cheaper.  And oh yeah - about the music?  This CD rocks - Carlos is en fuego!!

B000002A46|1.0|And whilst your listening to this CD, that will be more clear than ever, as you will wonder what you did wrong to deserve such a toturous experience. Mariah's voice seems undeveloped, and the production is non-existent. The songs are contrived and cliche, and  the overall quality is poor. Mariah's huge ego stops this album from having any real warmth, and her snobbery shines through on many of the songs, paricularly 'All i want for chistmas', where it is obvious that she is a woman who always gets what she wants. For a supeior, and warmer christmas album, purchase Dolly Parton's 'Home For Christmas'.
0740748475|5.0|I am not sure if Calvin reminds me more of myself or my kids growing up. I also have always wondered if Calvin and Hobbes were related in Bill Watterson's mind with the Jean Cauvin (John Calvin) and Thomas Hobbes. In looking through these I keep trying to see if there is a resemblance. Are the characters' characters like those characters? Was Calvin so tempermental? Was Hobbes so easy and care-going? I wonder....<br />Imagine how much more understanding kids can be with wonderful materials like this to inspire them and give them a sense of self reflection!
B000B8QEZG|2.0|i'm a madonna fan and really enjoyed her last album.  there's nothing on this one to compare to \\"love profusion\\" off of american life.  it's all shallow disco with a 16/16 beat.  the music is uninspired, dull, and repetitive.  at least the producers decided to lose the annoying pitch-shifter they have been using on vocals since cher's album \\"believe\\".  it's time to hang your pumps and ho outfit up, madonna, cause you jumped the shark with this album for me.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|The commentary for RISING includes Joe Flannigan, which is great.  I actually enjoyed the commentary, unlike some of the SG-1 commentaries where they seem to talk just to be able to say all or most of the episodes have commentary.  I haven't listened to the other commentaries but this is the set to get for good commentary, logic says, because the series is new and they have stories as yet untold.  Also, I just got confirmation that the U.S. sets are fine.  It is the Canada sets and only the Canada sets that have the disc 5 problem.
B000040OBS|5.0|The things written about this album already are 100% true. It is a fabulous, and innovative album, and influenced many subsequent acts in many different genres of music. The thing that seems to be missing from those reviews is that fact that, in my opinion, this album is TERRIFYING. Alan Vega's howling, desperate cries over Martin Rev's grinding synths and drum beats could be the soundtrack to your nightmares. Check this awesome record out. <br /> <br />Also, if you can track down a copy of the (I think out of print) book Cripple Nation, by Alan Vega, you should. It's a pretty interesting look into the man's mind, in the form of lyrics, poems, prose, and drawings.
B000000H6Y|5.0|Ha..so many different type's of music fan's all agree this album RULE's!!!!!    I have had this one..for ever!!!!! well at least it seem's..THIS BRING's back so many teen age memorie's..we(people I hung around/talked to) all use to love this album( I still do!!)    I remember I use to think TYPE O was ''coal chamber'' there fore I said they ''sucked''!! HAHA..I can still remember stupid thing's like that!!    This was maybe the best ''commerical''(well POPULAR let's put it!!) METAL album of the 90's..make's PANHORDER sound like korn!!    I feel sorry for a teenage kid who didnt grow up with ''Christian Woman''...That song till this day still make's me think!!!!    If you are 14 ...hey BUY THIS NOW!!!! YOU WILL THANK ME!!    Was DEF a life style!!    ''JESUS CHRIST LOOKS LIKE ME..''..THIS ALBUM IS TIMLESS TO ME!!!
B000BO0LKY|1.0|Mariah carey must be the most greedy and worthless artist in the music industry today. Her fake love for her fans, coupled with her over-produced B-grade music, is untolerable. By re-releasing this album, she has shown her true colors, as this is an abdonimable display of greed. The album was mediocre to begin with, and with lots of luck, it sold fairly well. However, Mariah is pushing her luck with this release. She should have at least lost some weight before she released it! <br /> <br />She constantly strives to prove that she is 'street', when she simply isn't. Her voice is weak, and only seems to shine in the studio (I wonder why). Her lyrics are cliche, and serve to make us beleive that with all that money, she actually has struggles. Give me a break!! The only struggle she probably does have is that huge rear end of hers. <br /> <br />If you want to here what real talent and music sounds like, then purchase madonna's new album 'Confessions On A Dancefloor'. A stunning mix of dance, disco and nostalgic seventies funk, this album may be the best of madonna's career, and certainly the best of 2005.
B00000IWVS|5.0|I would buy this just for the 1st and last recordings and you get even more than that. So Horowitz is close to perfect. But what about her? Pure talent!! This recording was withheld for many years due to competing recording company contracts. You would be doing yourself a favor for buying this CD.
0385338686|5.0|I got this book on a whim.  I have been trying to read different types of books than what I would normally look for.  I kept seeing this author in the book store and though to myself that I should check one of her books out one day.  I don't think I started from the beginning (if there is one) of the series, but this was fun!  I enjoyed that it was written from a person with an English vocabulary.  It was a hoot trying to figure out what some words meant.  Also trying to put a dollar amount on the pound when they use it.  This is truly a fun story. I can relate to the being embarrassed and running from it only to find out that I didn't need to.  Check it out and enjoy.  I am getting ready to read another one soon!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|In the late '70s there was a recession and it was disco music that brought people together, helped them forget their blues and just dance and be happy. Madonna's comeback album is a complete 180 degree turn from American Life, which was a serious, dramatic, and emotional journey and reflection of our times...from the political to the romantic.  It sounded like nothing else before or since. It was a misunderstood masterpiece, and yet Confessions on a Dancefloor, which is so different, is equallty brilliant and suited for our times.  It took a few years for the music industry to catch up with American Life, and now we have acts like Green Day making similar political statements in music. <br /> <br />Well, Madonna is still one step ahead and here she reinvents disco.  It's revolutionary disco music, meant to make you happy and surge dance music into the future while also recalling the glory of its past.  What would dance music be without Abba and Madonna--well there are references to Abba disco as well as her own career and others throughout the disc.  It is energetic and forceful music, very psychadelic and magical. Madonna is definitely back and as good as ever. It's too bad American Life was ignored, but Confessions on a Dancefloor will put the queen of pop back on top where she deserves to be. <br /> <br />My personal favorite track on the album is \\"Forbidden Love,\\" a crossover dance-ballad which has the power to haunt your dreams.  There are not any true ballads on the album, and most of the lyrics lack a great amount of depth, but that is intended--this is not music to make you think, but just to turn your brain off and feel the overwhelming joy of FUN music! <br /> <br />Madonna is a force in the industry, a legend, and perhaps the greatest musical pioneer and act of our time. We have no other stars quite as influential or popular or as creative as Madonna. Let's not be sexist and judge her by her age--she is a great woman of our times and Confessions on a Dancefloor is her latest reincarnation.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Wow I was really surprised at \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" because I never really liked the band before but wow they really know how to rock hard ALA: \\"ATTACK\\" or \\"KILLING ME\\". To cut things short this is a fantastic album nothing is anywhere near bad and this band has risen to the top very quickly! GO OUT AND BUY NOW!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|There is nothing that I could write in a review to convey the beauty of this music.  You cannot dance to it, but you can certainly revel in it.  You would be hard-pressed to sing along with it, but certainly can understand the emotion.  For all I know, it is the Music Of The Spheres.  I don't know whether Sigur Ros are heirs to Pink Floyd and progressive rock or heirs to The Sugarcubes and post-punk or whether they are just so completely original that their only connection to anybody else is that they play the same instruments with human hands and sing with human vocal cords.  They are otherwise completely unique. <br />
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Hands Down 'BEST ALBUM RELEASED IN ALL OF 2005' I love this CD alot.. Vocally Mariah's on point flawless nobody can top MC or say she can't sang cause she can.. Lyrically one of her best works in years.. the new 4 tracks are amazing(why didn't she put these on the 1st one?).. <br /> <br />People don't listen to these people giving it only 1-star.. There jealous,immature teenagers who have no taste for good music and there Jennifer Lopez fans(enough said)..
B000BGH22W|4.0|First off, we can never compare ANYONE to John Williams, the original composer for the first three Harry Potter soundtrack (also composer of the best movies in the universe, the Star Wars saga, and other included Jaws, E.T., Indiana Jones...just listing a few). John Williams is the best man for this type of classical music soundtrac business, but I am not here to discuss about how I am such a fan of John...but about this soundtrack.<br /><br />Patrick Doyle is just like any other movie composers, you know, composers such as for those movies besides Harry Potter, so there's really nothing I have aganist him (I tried not to, at least). So by being fair, I will no longer discuss about how he is not as good as John Williams.<br /><br />The soundtrack; pretty good overall. I can hear that Pat likes a lot of sixteenth notes and notes that are faster than that, for the violins, which is okay. The whole fast music brings up the feeling of how dark this movie is, which is dark, by the way...maybe not as dark as those dark movies, but pretty dark compare to the other Harry Potter movies. So, dark movies need to have dark music, and I think by listening to that, I can envision the dark things that are happening (I haven't seen the movie yet, but the premiere is tonight and I am going!). I usually watch the movies and then buy the soundtrack, but this time, I decided that, why not buy the soundtrack first? So I did.<br /><br />Wondering if this worths the buy? Ummmm...Yeah I guess, if you are waiting for the movie to come out in DVD then you should buy the soundtrack right now and listen to it til the movie comes out.
0380002930|4.0|When a friend mentioned that he was in the midst of reading a book about the adventures of rabbits, and suggested that I pick it up - I kind of scoffed at the idea.  Rabbits?  Adventure?  Yeah, right.    Yeah.  He was right.  This story of a few brave rabbits that choose to leave their home rather than suffer a terrible fate was not easy to put down.  In search of a new warren and a new life, Hazel and his band of rabbits face some serious adventure that most certainly matches up against that of any trendy teenage wizards.      They are cunning, they are clever, and although they didn't all get along at first, these rabbits grow to appreciate what each character brings to the mix.  As a reader, you'll appreciate them too... They are alive, and they are intent on risking it all to thrive in a new place.    After finishing the book I was left with the feeling of total satisfaction that only one of the greats can deliver.  Filled with legendary heroes and evil villains alike - I am embarrassed that I ever wondered if rabbits could raise the bar.    Read it.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Fantastic album from the queen of pop. The best CD from Madonna in a long time.. I can't stop listening to it and you wont be able to either. All Dance, non stop fun! My favourites are Hung Up, Let It Will Be and Get Together. You could not want more from a CD Madonna and Stuart Price make magic!
B00004U2GH|5.0|I'm a Johnny Cash fan, since I \\"discovered\\" his music about 3 years ago with American IV.  This is a good album, with a wide variety of songs and several minutes of Johnny Cash rambling on the microphone.  It's not quite as tight as Folsom Prison Blues, but it's live and it really shows how good he and his band really are.  I like the \\"spirituals\\" that he performs, they are done very well and add some real emotion to the album.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin remind us what real men, integrity, honor and heroes are supposed to be about.<br /><br />Great film LOOSELY based upon actual events.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Just when you think that the Batman franchise was dead, in comes a new film to give the franchise a breathe of fresh air. \\"Batman Begins\\" takes the story of the superhero Batman right to the beginning. The viewer sees what lead Bruce Wayne to become Batman and not in just brief flashback scenerios. The first 45 minutes of the film goes into great detail to how Bruce Wayne acquired the skills that he knows as Batman through his rigorous training with Liam Neeson's character Henri Ducard. In the begining, one can't help notice the similiarities between Henri and Liam's character in \\"Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace\\" Qui-Gon Jinn. Christian Bale was an excellent choice to play Batman. His quiet intensity gave Bruce Wayne/Batman proved to be the most convincing since Michael Keaton. The film was a bit slow and sluggish at times. I found Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes a bit unbelievable. I just couldn't believe that she was an assistant d.a but she wasn't completely terrible. I think she was just a bit too young for the role, not to mention the wrong actress to play Rachel Dawes. I think the film would have been better had there been no romantic storyline between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes. I always didn't like it in the Batman films when Bruce Wayne would hook up with some attractive young woman except maybe for Catwoman. I found the romantic storyline a distraction in the film. I think the film should have had a pre-Two Face Harvey Dent instead of Rachel Dawes as the prosecuting attorney. Michael Keaton was excellent as the butler Alfred, and gotta love Cillian Crane/Scarecrow. After the last two awful Batman films, \\"Batman Begins\\" definitely gave new life to the franchise.
B0006284JQ|4.0|Okay, so this girl ain't got Mariah Carey's chops but few female artists do these days. But in her early days she could sing, even if mediocre at that. Still there is no denying Spears' musical power to persuade regardless if her singing talents may be lacking. From her very bubblegum beginnings in 1998-1999 (listed here \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Crazy\\") to her latest sophisticated techno-pop (\\"Me Against the Music,\\" \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Outrageous\\"), Britney, in a whirlwind six year span, has become the epitome of the perfectly packaged pop star. Her stance as the industry's reigning No. 1 female entertainer is only intensified here on her first Greatest Hits album. Call her a skank, call her a sellout or call her a bad influence; but amazingly Spears has been able to maintain on top through all the accusations and become the fastest selling female performer in history. On this her Greatest Hits record, the now-24 year-old Britney is out to create even more of a stir since a Greatest Hits is usually after 10 years in the business, and she has only six. But the important thing to realize (compared to other Greatest compilations like Mandy Moore's, for example) is that Britney Spears is such a cultural phenomenon that only she can put out such a record and keep it at the forefront in sales. Almost every track on this album has been a sensation on the charts, from her award-winning, Grammy-nominated smash debut \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to 2000's best song (also Grammy-nominated) \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" from mature (also Grammy-nominated) \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" to 2004's best single and Grammy-winning \\"Toxic.\\" Sure, it has its low moments, like the I-can't-believe-it-was-a-single \\"Boys\\" and the fact that it's missing vocally-decent (in Spears terms, of course) songs like \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,\\" \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,\\" but the cover art alone is more than enough of a reason to purchase this CD. So love her or hate her, that doesn't matter, folks, because whether you like her or not, Britney Spears is a musical force to be reckoned with.

I sat down on a park bench and read it in an afternoon and laughed out loud while reading it.  This made me put men into perspective.  They are not hard to figure out.  If a guy wants you he will work to get you.  He will ask you out.  He will call you.  Otherwise, he may like you a bit but obviously not enough to actively pursue you or want you in his life.  Great, great book.  Very funny.  Wonderful advice.

B00009W0U4|1.0|Trust me, you do not need to be exposed to brutal murders and rapes. It's an overrated experience you can do without. <br /> <br />IRREVERSIBLE presents these crimes for viewing, and they amount to psychological assault. I will say this; Noe is very good at providing the viewing public with this \\"material.\\" I believe that the only stuff that can match his movies would be recordings of actual people committing such acts, almost representing snuff movies. <br /> <br />The dialog was mostly improvised by the actors. Noe just followed a rough outline indicating the direction for each scene. The acting was for the most part good, although with this type of direction is unlikely to notice bad acting, since good or even bad actors can just resort to the characters they portray best. <br /> <br />The chronology is reversed (hence it's title), and the story is about a couple of lovers with a friend (female's ex-boyfriend) who went out for a night of fun. They do drugs, her lover takes her granted and the girl leaves the club upset of her lover's behavior. On her way home, she gets raped and beaten almost to death in an underpass by a pimp. Her lover and ex-boyfriend go out in a rampage seeking revenge. Once in the club a confrontation with the alleged rapist turns gruesome and the ex-boyfriend, who was acting as \\"the voice of reason\\" on the way to the club, ends up beating the hell out of the rapist with a fire extinguisher. <br /> <br />Not much of an original story, so what does the \\"director\\" decides to do. . .? reverse the chronology and twirl the camera around senselessly to give the illusion of her lover's state after drug abuse and state of mind after finding out the tragedy. Reversing the chronology does something in this movie. It does make you deal with what you just saw and adds sympathy to the characters when you otherwise wouldn't care less. At the end, you feel worse, and horrified, since the end is the beginning of the movie and you already know what will happen. You don't even get a sense of justice since the rapist gets away in the end. The wrong man was killed and the rapist stood there watching and smiling knowing he got away with his crime. Also, the music adapted is not music at all, is something a very low in audio frequency that may be used to disorient a crowd of people; it is very disturbing to your senses. The language is horrendously offensive, (vulgar, racist, homophobic, misogynistic), and they are other disturbing glimpses in scenes that although may not be as devastating as the rape and murder, complement the film's eagerness to shock. The \\"director\\" thrives in making us uncomfortable. <br /> <br />I guess all the fancy camera twirl, reversed chronological order, long uninterrupted scenes, and the fact that this movie is in French set this one into the \\"Art genre.\\" Personally, I think this is all pretentious work from a director with a short time-line to get a movie done. Monica and her husband (who also plays her lover in this \\"film\\") had a schedule to work on the Matrix, Noe had to hurry up and get this out. A long time was dedicated to the rape and the murder where computer effects were applied to indicate the horrifying graphical depiction of a head being batched with the fire extinguisher over, and over. The rape was rehearsed over eighth times to \\"get it right\\" and sound effects were amplified to enhance the violence to the Monica's beating after the rape. <br /> <br />If you take away the two notorious scenes that entice people to watch it (rape and murder), you would end up with absolutely nothing; no plot, very little direction, and some nudity from probably one of the sexiest and most beautiful and talented actress/models in Hollywood today (referring to Monica Belluci, of course). Monica is the reason I check this movie out, I'm a big fan of her work. <br /> <br />Taking into consideration that I would only recommend a movie with the premise that it will entertain its audience, no way in hell can I recommend this to anybody. It's not about the story, but how you feel after watching the horrendous scenes. This goes for all features from Gapar Noe.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, you can classify this movie as simply an exploitation flick. Usually, you can do that and dismiss it. Although the two scenes that make justify placing this \\"movie\\" into the exploitation category, the fact of the matter is that the rape and murder are just shown for the bad crimes that they  are. Nothing has being enhanced to portray it worst, or make it gorier. <br />  <br />Why only 1 star? Simply, because I can't give it 0. A work of art make of Sh$t is still a bundle of Sh$t. Exposing myself to this type of movies is just not my idea of a pleasant time.  <br /> <br />To those individuals who seek to watch this for its horror; I hope it is in fact what you are seeking, because this one will delivered just that.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is absolutely incredible. Stephen Root makes this movie a classic with his \\"I will set the building on fire\\" lines. No one could have performed this part better. All of us have had a job like this. That fax machine that says there is a paper jam when there is no paper jam. That boss who just doesn't get that you might have a life outside of work. Those thoughts about stealing millions from the company. And most importantly, that dream we have all had about seeing the building go up in flames. Ahhhh, poetic justice.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Wow, I couldn't believe how bad this was after all the hype and great reviews! I own a lot of Madonna's earlier work, most notably the Immaculate Collection. Now, that's dance music. This is boring, droning, repetitive, mechanical and monotonous. It reminds me of a broken record, every song blends into the next until 45 minutes later, you realize how bored and tired of the whole affair you are. It ain't disco folks, it's \\"Techno\\" and it stinks. Anyone who calls this a return to form or even suggests it's disco music is either under 21 years old or needs the wax removed from their ears! A real piece of crap. This will let you know why the music business is hurting.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|The remastered CD sounds great but as mentioned above the nearly 4 hours of bonus DVD material is the real reason to buy this boxed set. The mini-lp cardboard/packaging is very cool if you are into that kind of novelty (although the Japenese mini-lps do a better job with the actual dimensions but then again they are not remastered). The CD media device is even on one of those that looks like it has the album grooves and labels. Oh yeah, and the 48 page booklet is nice too....<br /><br />...But back to the DVDs. The 1975 Hammersmith show is the real jem. This is the Holy Grail for long time die hard Springsteen fans who know about his bootleg material. It will also please those who are new to the Boss. This has been available on bootleg for almost 30 years now. And has been remastered almost to perfection in bootleg form. However, there are gaps of film and audio missing in what is available on bootleg and only half the concert was there. This version has the FULL CONCERT, all the film and audio which very few people knew existed!!! I can't begin to explain how excited I am that the entire show is finally available and in terrific video and remastered 5.1 audio. The \\"Making of\\" DVD is a great set up for both the album and the Hammersmith show. It provides great insight into the overnight sensation Springsteen was in 1975 and how this was - after two critically acclaimed albums which didn't sell but 200,000 or so copies - this was as he mentioned in \\"Rosalita\\", his \\"last chance\\" (although I don't know how much of \\"a big advance\\" the record company had given him at the time). More importantly, you see what a huge undertaking this album was, the efforts put in by everyone involved, the striving for perfection, retaking, rewriting, rearranging. Bruce was involved in every little detail of everything, from every note of Clarence's Saxophone solos to mastering of the final product. The B&W in studio footage is precious. Further study and insight of Springsteen at this time will tell you the BTR album was on the fringes of Rock and Roll at the time. No one could concieve of an album like this. His popularity and the excitement about Springsteen in the fall shortly after BTR was released no doubt hit the pop/rock world in the U.S. like an unexpected tidal wave. But the Hammersmith show is in England where he gets a lukewarm reception despite an amazing performance. The only thing in pop music that I can compare his overnight rise to stardom in the U.S. is the Beatles on Ed Sullivan in 1964 and the release of Nirvana's Nevermind.<br /><br />In summary, the jem is the 1975, 2 hour Hammersmith performance. The rest of the material, the booklet, remastered BTR and the making of BTR titled \\"Wings to Wheels\\" (an early title for the song \\"Thunder Road\\") are great to have as well. There are an additonal 3 songs from a show in 1973 which shows you how his music and lyrics had changed between 1973 and 1975. The jazz members of his band leaving after recording only one song on BTR which took 6 months. If you know about his later work you know how he simplified things and the songs became, less dense, more sparse but no less artistic. BTR has a \\"Wall of Sound\\". It is huge lyrically and musically.<br /><br />I paid $28 for the box set and would have paid at least that for the full concert of the Hammersmith show alone. This is a must have for any Springsteen fan. A great history lesson for those who know little about the Boss but are interested in his music.

B0000029AP|5.0|RECORD!  If you're looking for the best songs in Aerosmith history, you'll find all of them on the band's 1975 breakthrough, \\"Toys in the Attic\\".  I've had this album for five years now, and still listen to it at least once a day.  Why you ask?  Because this album kicks a mountain of @ss!  All the songs are awesome, no filler what so ever.  You even get the best song Aerosmith ever recorded in their entire career----\\"Big Ten Inch Record\\".  I mean this song kicks so much @ss, it would make the entire Aerosmith catalogue look like the soundtrack to \\"Saturday Night Fever\\"!  And the lyrics...I have never heard such gut poundingly hilarious lyrics in my life! <br /> <br />\\"Got me the strangest woman <br />Believe me this trick's no cinch <br />But I really get her going <br />When I whip out my big ten inch <br />Record of a band that plays the blues <br />Record of a band that plays the blues <br />She just loves my big ten inch <br />Record of her favourite blues!\\" <br /> <br />So if you want to hear Aerosmith at their best, go whip out your big ten inch.  Record, and play all the songs on it.  You will be amazed!
0380789019|5.0|This was my first book by Neil Gaiman, which I picked up because I remembered loving the Sandman comics when I wore a younger man's clothes.  The first 10 or so pages had me a little weary, but once this story picks up (ie. the main character finds Door) this book just blew me away.  It became one of those addictive books that are so good you blow off all of your friends and make excuses so you don't get made fun of for spending a Friday night reading.  Not quite sci-fi, not quite fantasy, this book chronicles the story of a man suddenly propelled into a world he never knew existed beneath London, and offers many interesting characters and ideas.  It's hard to review without spoiling, but just trust me, if you have taste, get this!
B00097DXZS|3.0|The updated media reports state that Santana's new CD does NOT contain the Sony/BMG's damaging copy protection technology.<br /><br />Apparently it was manufactured just prior to the rollout of the XCP technology-- Developed by  First 4 Internet, this is the copy protection program that creates the rootkit issue.<br /><br />It does, however, contain the older style copy protection system, which is annoying enough. Carlos Santana & his wife have responded with anger  over the situation with their record company,  issued an immediate apology that their album would cause distress of any kind among their fans, & had a showdown with their label to  push for an immediate recall of all of the label's cds \\"infected\\" with XCP technology.<br /><br />Hmm. Stoner musician seems to have smarter business sense than experienced corporate execs. Where did Sony execs learn their P.R. skills? The Bush administration?<br /><br />As for the actual musical content--  I'll say adequate, yet disappointingly pedestrian. I'm not talking just plain awful, like the worthless output of \\"Santana the Corporate Rock\\" entity of the 80's. This is pleasant enough to throw into a randomized mix playlist.<br /><br />But for a collaboration with some stellar talent, this is surprisingly less than stellar.

B000002GQJ|5.0|Question of Balance was one of my first records back in the 70'ties, more precise in 1974 if I remember. Along with Machine Head, Black Sabbath and Grand Funk.     The record has this mysterious sound and atmosphere, not found on any other records ( except perhaps other Moody Blues albums ).    I never get tired of listening to Question of Balance, good for listening late in the evening, an evergreen and among my top records. Its not a party record, unless you are an old flower power freak with joints and all that grass. Definitely not an extacy record.    Buy it and get a record for life, no matter your age, taste, height - as long as you are a lower of quality music. The remastering of the old 70-record is quite good, and sound just OK on my good old JBL L100 Century speakers. Unfortunately many of the records recorded in the 70-ties lacks good recording quality, which the JBL L100 will discover immediately.    I also have the Seventh Sojourn which I also warmly can recommend, close to Question of Balance.
B000002MM8|5.0|About the Band:<br /><br />Dead Can Dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre.  In fact, the name of the label, 4AD, which carried many of the 1990s DCD releases, is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music, which is a fusion of subtle electronics, vocals, drums, world music, and a near limitless count of instruments.  Brendan Perry sometimes has been described as a gothic Frank Sinatra.  Lisa Gerrard's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to Lisa.  I count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem.<br /><br />About the Album:<br /><br />Compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks, the 50-minutes of Into the Labyrinth would seem short, if it weren't for the fact that I like to listen to this album over and over again.  I count this album as one of my all time favorites, and certainly my most prized Dead Can Dance CD.<br /><br />One of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both Lisa's and Brendan's ghostly vocals.  On some tracks they accompany each other, while others feature only one of the artist's chilling or mystical sounding vocals.  Simply put, this is beautiful music to relax to.  I honestly give this album my highest recommendations!<br /><br />Two tracks I'd recommend sampling: \\"Towards the Within\\" (featuring Lisa's vox w/ Brendan backing) and \\"Tell Me About the Forest\\" (featuring Brendan's vox).  I believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album.  Please note that while all the tracks feature vocals, the lyrics for only those sung in English are included in the liner notes.<br /><br />Similar Artists:<br /><br />Chances are if you aren't yet familiar with Dead Can Dance, that you've not yet discovered some of these other bands, but I highly recommend them as well: Das Zeichen, Impressions of Winter, Love is Colder Than Death, Qntal, Corvus Corax, or Helium Vola.  There is a rather large (and somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can Dance.  Please check some of them out as well.a rather large (and somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can Dance.

B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah sung her way onto the music scene 15 years ago and blew people away with her great voice. And once again, she has made an incredible return enchanting listeners all over again. This is a comeback for the ages. Mariah Carey has always been known for her great signature ballads like VISION of LOVE, HERO, and MY ALL. And now with this great album she gives us WE BELONG TOGETHER, MINE AGAIN, I WISH YOU KNEW, FLY LIKE A BIRD, and DON'T FORGET ABOUT US. Mariah has also been known throughout the years to do rap-sung collaborations. So you get notable guest appearances by Snoop Dogg on SAY SOMETHIN', Twista on ONE and ONLY and SO LONELY, Jermaine Dupri on GET YOUR NUMBER and MAKIN' IT LAST ALL NIGHT. I have to say that I'm really impressed with this re-release. Mariah made a great album even greater. Don't hesitate to buy this excellent CD/DVD.
B000002GQL|5.0|Very nice album from Moody Blues. If you are new to Moody Blues, you may want to start with the Question of Balance, but Seventh Sojourn is close behind and could be your second Moody Blues album. <br /> <br />Both records will remain among my top records in my collection. <br /> <br />I rate the album a 4.5 star album, mainly because Question of Balance is a clear 5, and this album is slightly less, but since its only possible to give full stars, I give it 5.
B000B0QOJA|4.0|Hi folks, well I'm not nearly the jazz expert that many of the other reviewers here seem to be but I would like to add my two cents. It's a shame the sets are not complete but it can't be denied that the quartet is BLAZING on these cuts. Boy, once 'One Down, One Up' hits about the fifteen minute mark you have no doubt that you are listening to something special. No question there are other Coltrane recordings a new listener should start with, live or otherwise, but for a Coltrane aficionados this release is a real treat. <br /> <br />However, I have to say I was rather shocked to hear the numerous dropouts in sound during the title track. I realize that this release is a large step up in fidelity from the bootlegs that are floating out there but proper jazz companies on the whole are usually quite honest about sound quality issues.  <br /> <br />Having said this, don't let it prevent you from picking up this double cd. Any chance to hear the quartet in a live setting is a real treat.
B00002Z88D|4.0|I have seen Metallica in concert and an avid fan for most of there work.  This CD compilation came to be with the orchestral care of the late Michael Kamen (notable from Pink Floyd's The Wall and Nothing Else Matters). There are some really great works here and there are some disappointing parts.  The Call of Ktulu, Master of Puppets, No Leaf Clover (new one here), One (monumental), Enter Sandman, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Outlaw Torn, and Fuel are good here.  The rest of the pieces are done moderately well.  I am not much of a fan of Reload tracks (except Fuel was done well), and feel that they could have chose better songs to orchestrate like Orion.  No Leaf Clover is one of Metallica's best, and works well with the orchestra. It is a good album and you feel a part of the crwod for awhile.  The recording could have better better mixed between the orchestra and band.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is Madonna's best since \\"Ray of Light.\\" I've been a big fan for years. It's hard to forget all of the great songs that she's recorded. There's no one else quite like Madonna. She's a genuine legend and this album is proof of that. Words can't really describe how clever and creative she is. For Madonna, reinvention has always been a good thing. And this time is no exception. \\"Confessions on a Dane Floor\\" will quickly become a Madonna classic. I would pick this CD up right away. It's worth every penny.

0684833395|4.0|The spotlight in which Catch-22 has remained since it became so very popular during the 1960's, is one of great significance to literature.  Heller was ingenues in the way he compiled the stories of these seemingly simple characters.  The further along in the story the more attached you become the each character.  You fall in love when they do, feel loss when they are morning and find humor when you realize the foolishness of their situations.  <br />This book was the first of its kind in the way it was organized.  It's plot is not in chronological order and you find things out long before you truly understand what they mean.  This book is a wonderful piece of literature and recommend not only reading it, but possibly reading it again to fully understand it.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Although `Cream' were known as the first Supergroup this certainly was not their intention when they formed in 1966. Eric Clapton who had made his name as a guitarist of undoubted ability first in the `Yardbirds' and then in `John Mayall's Bluesbreakers' was looking around for a new gig. One night Ginger Baker, ex Graham Bond's Organization, sat in on a `Bluesbreakers' gig, afterwards suggesting to Eric Clapton, \\"How about getting a band together?\\" To which Clapton responded, \\"Ok, How about Jack Bruce?\\"<br /><br />Now here was the first problem as Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker had already played together in `The Graham Bond Organization' and had hated each other so much that during one physical fight Ginger Baker had actually tried to stab Jack Bruce with a knife. But Eric Clapton wanted Jack Bruce and would not budge without him so bridges had to be built.<br /><br />Since his flight from `The Graham Bond Organization' Jack Bruce had played temporarily with `John Mayall's Bluesbreakers', a couple of gigs with Eric Clapton when a mental note had been made by the lead guitarist, and then had been lured away by the devil money to play with pop band `Manfred Mann'. But when offered the job with a real band again by the other two, musically he was only too glad to jump ship.<br /><br />Even though they never got along personally, musically as a rhythm section Bruce and Baker were a match made in rock `n' roll dreams. Add to that Bruce's stunning voice and harmonica work, you have the perfect foil for Eric Clapton's mercurial guitar histrionics. When they started out the idea was to be a blues trio to play small clubs like Buddy Guy with a decent rhythm section.<br /><br />But in 1966 the whole world was turned on its head with `Psychedelic's, Hendrix', `Sergeant Pepper's', etc. Baker, Clapton, and Bruce, calling their trio `Cream' naturally rose to the top. They only actually lasted for twenty eight months from July 1966 until November 1968 when they walked off stage at the Albert Hall for the last of their farewell tour gigs, after which three of them did not share the same room for 35 years. But during those short sweet months they achieved so much.<br /><br />They had three hit albums: `Fresh Cream' (1966), `Disraeli Gears' (1967) and `Wheels Of Fire' (1968) a double album, half live, half studio, which went number one all over the world. This astonished their record company Atlantic so much (that they had a band that could sell over two million dollars worth of product with one album), they invented the Platinum album as a tribute to them. Their final tour of the United States of America grossed over 540,000 dollars in six weeks, and it is not surprising a lot of company executives cried when they split up. You must put in context how much a million dollars was in 1968 to get a real grip on how huge `Cream' was at the time.<br /><br />In the three years after the band had finished, Atlantic put out four more albums. The contractually binding `Goodbye Cream' (1969) which included three live tracks and three studio cuts; `Badge' being one studio track co-written between Eric Clapton and George Harrison never played live by the band until this reunion. `Badge' is probably one of the songs `Cream' were later best known for. `Best Of Cream' (1969), which was followed by `Live Cream' (1970) and finally `Live Cream Volume Two' (1972). These were all top ten hit albums worldwide. There have of course been hundreds of compilation and exploitation albums since.<br /><br />In 2004 Eric Clapton mooted the idea to Baker and Bruce about a possible reunion. Both at first were resistant to the idea, but arms were twisted, and eventually a meeting was arranged. Time had, as is often the case, healed old wounds, and it was decided to hire a rehearsal studio just to see! It went well.<br /><br />The Albert Hall was booked for four nights in early May 2005 (The tickets sold out in minutes, and swapped hands for thousands on e-bay). The risks were musically staggering, time has moved on so much (we are talking thirty seven years here), would a power trio be able to cut the mustard in today's age of technology, backing tapes, click tracks, etc? Would Ginger Baker kill Jack Bruce during rehearsals, or vice versa? Could Eric Clapton still put the hammer down on the electric guitar as of days of yore?<br /><br />Actually, the only problem was an attack of nerves by the normally nerveless Baker who wanted to pull out two days before the first concert, but was talked round by Clapton. To top it all this was a band that was volatility itself, one night the best in the world, but on another day ... Oh dear. What if the first night was not all it should be! Would any of them turn up for the next night?<br /><br />This DVD is positive proof that nothing like that happened. They saunter on stage for opening number `I'm So Glad' on the first night, and the old magic bounces between the three musicians. All four nights were recorded; afterwards the band watched the tapes and decided which was the best version of each song and put it out as a complete concert in its correct running order. (If they could not make up their minds which night was better, they simply tacked it on as a bonus track to the DVD.) You know which night each song was taken from as a little sign pops up at the beginning of each song to let you know.<br /><br />All of the great `Cream `songs are here, including the never before played `Badge' and the wonderful Ginger Baker sung `Pressed Rat and Warthog', both from `Goodbye Cream'. There is even a version of Ginger Baker's drum solo number `Toad', which may have been cut from its seventies length twenty minutes, but at over seven minutes still shows that Ginger Baker is not ready to pass on his greatest jazz/rock drummer title yet.<br /><br />Jack Bruce's vocals and Harmonica playing are better than they ever were, whilst his bass playing remains as inspirational as ever. Can Eric Clapton still give every rock guitarist in the world a run for their money? After only one song there is only one answer: a huge big yes. All of the playing is simply better than you could possibly wish for.<br /><br />The DVD is stocked full of bonuses including interviews with all three of the band. The concert alone is over two hours long. Eighth song in `Politician' after the bass introduction, the rest of the band join in as they slip into that `Cream' groove, Jack Bruce looks up and smiles at Ginger Baker and Ginger Baker smiles back - now that never happened the last time they played the Albert Hall.<br /><br />Mott the Dog.o much (we are talking thirty seven years here), would a power trio be able to cut the mustard in today's age of technology, backing tapes, click tracks, etc?

076790592X|5.0|Just like life this book is simple and true and full of Love and usually it takes something as dramatic as death to find the Love in all pores of Life itself.<br /><br />My boss recommended this book to me and said: if you do not cry your eyes out you have a heart of stone. I did cry - at home, at work, on the train on my way to work, with my friends, it touched me and it will stay with me for the rest of my life. This book is a true blessing.
B00068ULLY|2.0|I thought Pulp Fiction was the best film of the 90s, which pains me to say, because the decade contains Goodfellas and Martin Scorcese is my favorite director. When you consider PF along with Reservoir Dogs and the True Romance screenplay, Tarantino emerges as one of the singular voices of the past 35 years. But it seems he has lost it.<br /><br />Yes, there are flashes of brilliance in Vol. 2 (Uma's initial meeting with fighting master Pei Mei is mesmerizingly cool and surreal). However, it seems as if more than 50% of this film is spent in having to listen to David Carradine's Bill ramble on about the film's backstory. It's a film Quentin, not a novel-show some of the exposition, don't put it all in the mouths of your characters.<br /><br />And am I the only person who thinks Uma Thurman cannot deliver a line without sounding like she is acting? From Pulp Fiction to Beautiful Girls to the Kill Bill set. She blantantly lacks the requisite chops to carry a film with so much dialogue.<br /><br />I am baffled as to why this movie was greenlighted to be a two-parter. Maybe there's a decent two hour film in there, but as is, these were overwrought and soporific.
0307276902|1.0|As a recovering addict, I knew there would be tragedy at the end of this book. Maybe the James Frey Program worked for James but it didn't work for Lilly and probably won't work for the majority of addicts. What if \\"The Rules\\" and the 12 steps had worked for Lilly? I believe that his helping her to rebel against \\"The Program\\" and \\"The Rules\\" was completely, utterly selfish and irresponsible. The steps that he disdains might have given her tools to deal with her Grandmother's death. I am not impressed with this book at all. I hope James Frey feels some responsibility for Lilly's death. So sad.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ever since 2000's \\"Music\\", my interest for Madonna and her music started to wane. Not because of the actual performer. Madge has always been great at what she does! But mostly due to the fact that she had started to abadon her pop roots in favor of songs that seemed to rely a lot on political or just gibberish (what am I talking about? \\"American Life\\" anyone). But, that all changed when I decided to purchase Madonna's new album, Confessions of a Dance Floor. And I'm glad I did. This is her most accessible and best album since \\"Ray of Light\\" <br /> <br />It took me a few listens to absorb each track and bask in it's electronica-type goodness. There are a couple of tracks I could do without, but the rest of the album is great and screams the Madonna we all listened to and loved. I'm so glad Madonna crafted this masterpiece. A true homage back to her roots indeed.  <br /> <br />Standout tracks for me on the album include: <br />\\"Future Lovers\\"-a great song with a beautiful beat that seems to sound like it has a tiny sample of Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\". But a Madge original that gets me jamming. The line \\"..in the ambience of it's brillance...\\" sticks with you throughout this gorgeous song. (at least that's what I think the line says) <br /> <br />\\"Sorry\\"-An interesting song with a hopping beat, with Madonna chanting out 'Sorry' in different languages, as well as singing a catchy chorus. <br /> <br />\\"I Love New York\\"-Most likely my favorite track on the album. A stand-out ode on her love for New York. A great beat with a good bass line and catchy vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Forbidden Love\\"-Sounds like a mix of \\"Fever\\" and \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\", but much better than the other two songs mentioned. This has a robotic Madonna's voice thrown in with a bit of ambience. A good beat,too. <br /> <br />\\"Jump\\"-A great new-wave/disco type beat accompanies the great lyrics for this song. Probably my second favorite on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Issac\\"-You know, it took me a few listens to actually dig this song. I'm starting to appreciate it for it's eccentric rhythm and Madonna's airy vocals. I was expecting something along the lines of \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" from her \\"Ray of Light\\" album. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are good for what they are,too. If you appreciate pop music in general, or a fan of Madonna, get this album. A great listen!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|It's interesting when you first hear songs leaked on the internet or on AOL Music because you can never really get a sense of the true size and scale of the song. It's hard to wrap your mind around it completely until you've heard it on the CD. And that comment relates to the 4 additional tracks: DON'T FORGET ABOUT US, MAKIN'T IT LAST ALL NIGHT, and the WE BELONG TOGETHER (remix). They sound so terrific on the CD. The leaks just don't do the songs justice. You have to hear them on the album to fully appreciate them. The production on this CD is excellent and very consistent. I didn't buy the re-release because of clever marketing, I bought it because I really like the new songs. I don't do much downloading. So for me, the album is a better investment. I like to consider the re-release like a textbook. It gives you a more complete view of the subject than just an outline or syllabus. So in other words, the re-release paints a bigger picture than the original because you get the video's also plus the extra songs. If you decide to purchase the original version at this point, it kind of negates the fact that anything took place afterwards. The first vision was not finite, it continued towards a greater resolution. The first was the midterm, this is the final. Mariah took a big risk by essentially trying to improve upon something that was already great. And I think she passed with flying colors. She did an excellent job on both versions. But musically, I find the re-release to be the most rewarding.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I went to see this film to see what the fuss was all about. The answer is: nothing. If they gave Academy Awards for \\"pre-film buzz creation,\\" this would surely get it. Unfortunately, there's not much to the film. I jadedly felt like I'd seen it all before (except for the blood, which, however, was nowhere near as gruesome as some critics would have you believe).<br /><br />Jim Caviezel was a pedestrian Jesus, while Monica Belucci was thoroughly forgettable as Magadalene. Only Maia Morgenstern was memorable (as Mary). She brought a touching pathos to her role.<br /><br />I searched hard for anti-Semitism and found none whatsoever. I also searched for a protagonist that I cared about. Sorry, but just because the movie is about Jesus, that doesn't give Mel a free pass to create a character completely detached from the viewer. Remember: this is a still just a movie. I found myself not really caring about the suffering, as no character development had been done leading up to that point.<br /><br />For a far more affecting look at the life of Jesus, see Scorcese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ.\\"<br /><br />(Finally, on a purely theological note, I fail to see the great \\"sacrifice\\" made by Jesus. If I knew that I was going to sit in judgement of all mankind at God's right hand, I would let them pummel me for a month. How is it a sacrifice if you're trading earthly existence for paradise? Sorry, that is NOT a sacrifice.)

0553801503|3.0|Yes disapointed, I did not believe I would be this disapointed with this book as the first three in the series are amongst the best fantasy ever writen but Martin changed the stuff that made the first books so good :    - POV : there are too many POV in this book and some have only one chapter, what is the point ? what was good about diffrent and limited number of POV is that you had only a unique view of one situation and when a new POV appeared in other books you got to have their point of views. So you had a lot of guessing to do, now you have to many points of view for a given situation, what is the point of having 1 chapter for some POV especially Arys ?    - The way the book ends : all chapters ends abuptly and let's you beg for more like any other book around: in the other books in the series it was the whole story that made you want more ! Here you just want to know what happens next for Arya or for Cersei but you are just concerned about the next few lines not the whole story just what happens after the last word, and you will learn it in the first chapter of that particular POV, so why cut it like this like any other writer would have done ?    - What has the title to do with tis book ?  A feast for crows : I was expecting wars and dead in the thousands...  How can crows feast when in the whole story there must be a handfull of death ? Martin should have changed the title when he split the books !    - And last but not least : the story did not move forward. Almost nothing happens in the book ! at least nothing requiring 1000 pages, if Martin had kept the pace of the other books and his style with POV we could have had the same number of pages but with much more happening and perhaps not a seventh book.    all in all I am disapointed but keep expecting the next installment because my favorite characters are in the other book and given their situation, there should be a lot more to tell about them.    Wait and see !

B000000WCA|4.0|Who doesn't remember this group?  You could truly say at one time these 5 sexy vixens dominated the world.  This group was pure gold, from their style to the very thing they stood for.  Each girl had an identity for people on all walks of life, from the cute (Baby) to sexy (Ginger).  From athletic (Sporty) to rich (Posh), and even just plain loose and crazy (Scary).  And together they represented the very message of \\"Girl Power,\\" a lingo that girls followed like the bible it's self.  And their music, given each girls limited vocal skills, managed to branch and change people's lives across the world.  One might even call their debut album \\"Spice\\" part one of dominating the world.  \\"Spice\\" was an instantaneous hit, and if one listens they can see why.<br /><br />Things start off with the song that you can still hear on commercial ads to this day: \\"Wannabe.\\"  Who doesn't remember this song?  Wether you appreciated for the pure fun it was, or mocked it by switching up the lyrics, this song truly goes down in history as the song that started it all.  And things were proceeded by follow up singles \\"Say You'll Be There\\" to my personal favorite Spice Girl song \\"2 Become 1\\".  On \\"2 Become 1\\" the girls managed to stay sexual sensual by mixing up \\"I had a little love, now I'm back for more\\" then following it up with \\"I wanna make love to ya baby\\" in seductive balladry that no one could resist.<br /><br />But of course as opposed to a lot of mid 90's albums, fun doesn't stop at the singles.  You'll find yourself bobbing your head to \\"Love Thing\\", or singing under your breath to \\"Something Kinda Funny\\", or even getting a little steamy to the seductive \\"Naked\\".  The album is pretty much a straight through listen, with the exception of \\"Last Time Lover\\" and \\"Mama\\".  However, the album was still pure fun and though it contained some filler.  But with songs like \\"2 Become 1\\" and \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\", one hardly cares.<br /><br />The Spice Girls had such a musical influence on the world, and in some ways you can still feel their presence in music to this day.  This album, along with their sophomore effort \\"Spice World\\" are two of my personal favorite albums of all time.

B000053V7O|5.0|\\"Round Midnight\\" is a masterpiece of a film that portrays the life of a jazz musician on an extended residence in Paris in the 1950's whose struggle with alcoholism and abuse by his \\"handlers\\" invites the friendship of a young Frenchman who attempts to aid him in sobriety and salvation.  The protagonist jazzman, \\"Dale Turner,\\" was based on a composite of real-life jazz legends Lester Young (tenor sax) and the tortured and enigmatic Bud Powell (piano).  In fact, while much of the film is fictionalized, much of it is drawn directly from the memoir/biography \\"Dance of the Infidels\\" written by Francis Paudras, who in real life befriended Bud Powell during his Parisian expatriate days and on whom the character \\"Francis\\" is based.       The tone of the film is wistful and tragic as it follows Turner's struggle as an artist creating incredible beauty but destroying himself with alcoholism, and the desperate attempts of his friend to save him (if you like happy stories over realism, stick to your standard Hollywood fare).  Tavernier defied the movie studio by insisting that real-life jazz tenor sax great Dexter Gordon (who himself played with Bud Powell in Paris in the 50's) play the role of Turner (he also helped to revise and rewrite the script).  Gordon has a soft, but gravelly voice that is difficult to understand on first listen, but his acting is top-notch (he is after all, playing someone he knew, as well as himself to some extent) and he nails one scene after another.  He captures Turner's struggle with disillusionment, death, loneliness, paternalism, racism, and the constant pressure to create art to a T.    I don't think you need to like jazz to like this film, but it probably wouldn't hurt.  There are a lot of extended scenes where Dexter Gordon is playing the music, along with a supporting cast composed of other real jazz legends such as Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, John McLaughlin, Wayner Shorter, and Pierre Michelot.  The result is an authentic portrait and tribute that captures the Paris jazz scene of the 50's, along with a stellar soundtrack (released in two parts as the official soundtrack \\"Round Midnight\\" and \\"The Other Side of Round Midnight\\" under Gordon's name).

The second time around they actually grew as vocalists, making their sophomore album Spice World even better than their debut.<br /><br />From the start one was in love the Latin driven \\"Spice Up Your Life\\", the pure pop \\"Stop\\", and the slick ballad \\"Too Much\\".  However, singles weren't all they had to offer.  Spice World was quick to back even more punch with the r&b flavored \\"Denying\\" and the futuristic \\"Move Over\\" which was featured in a Pepsi commercial.  And things only got better with the let-your-hair-down song \\"Saturday Night Divas\\" and the perky \\"Never Give Up on the Good Times\\".  But the album hits pure gold with the slower ballad \\"Viva Forever\\" and the Frank Sinatra inspired \\"The Lady Is a Vamp\\", each brilliant in their own way.<br /><br />Spice World offered a lot more variety than it's predecessor.  This is what made the album an all around work of art.  Though it wasn't exactly critically acclaimed, probably due to that by the time this album dropped the Spice Girls were getting on people's nerves with over marketing.  But despite that, this album is purely original compared to what was out there at the time.  Girl power was what the crowd wanted to hear, and it's what they got, and it's girl power that drove Spice World to the top.
0345298349|3.0|I had really high hopes for this novel. I actually enjoyed the film, though it was flawed. The reviews were universally popular too. Yet I found the novel slow, disjointed and rarely involving. <br /> <br />The initial mystery of the bodies in Gorky Park is quickly solved and forgotten. In fact, the story is really not a thriller at all. The film is much tighter and thrilling even though the rather tedious and unbelievable sable story is similar. <br /> <br />After the initial Gorky Park killings the film meanders without direction as it develops into a romance. The romantic plot is okay though never convincing. It also ends abruptly and in a less than convincing manner given the previous chapters. <br /> <br />The story really falls apart towards the end as Renko is holed up in a country house outside Moscow before going to the US.  <br /> <br />Overall there are some excellent passages in the book, but it didn't live up to my expectations.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|Playing The Angel continues Depeche Mode 'phase 2' since Alan Wilder left the band after their Devotional Tour. (Though strictly speaking, of course, it's Depeche Mode 'phase 3' if you count the fact that the band line-up had already changed previously following Vince Clarke's early departure.) What they've done this time around is an album perhaps better than Exciter in terms of being more focused and accessible, but not by any means as good as Ultra, an often quite beautiful album (one of their `top five' in my book.) Ultra is still, to my ears anyway, their best produced album since Wilder left (the arrangements on \\"Home\\", for example.) However, one of the things which made Depeche Mode such an exciting prospect while Wilder was with them was the way they sounded - the sonic richness and depth that was used to match and flesh out the songwriting.     And while I'm not discounting the role that people like Flood and Daniel Miller for instance must have played as regards the way the Mode once sounded, Wilder's absence is still felt on Playing The Angel. However, while the production on PTA is nothing like what went before in terms of depth or arrangements to go with the melodies, it's alright despite being something of a mixed bag too. Generally it does the job and sometimes it's very good - for instance in \\"The Sinner In Me\\" and in \\"The Darkest Star\\" - while also helping occasionally to make some of the weaker songs more interesting overall (like \\"I Want It All\\".) The reason I'd say the production is a mixed bag though, is that it at times also feels a bit tinny and overly technological without necessarily being interesting, and sometimes this happens in the very same songs in which the production is also in some way appealing.     While I can accept that they went for a different feel with the sound, part of the difficulty I have with Playing The Angel is that, as with Exciter, there are only a couple of songs that make a connection at an emotional level in quitethe same way as say, \\"Clean\\", \\"Enjoy The Silence\\", \\"Lie To Me\\", \\"It Doesn't Matter\\", \\"Stripped\\", \\"Here Is The House\\", \\"The Things You Said\\", \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\", \\"Home\\", \\"The Bottom Line\\" or any number of other songs from their past do. For me the best songs here are also those which have the greatest emotional resonance somehow - \\"Suffer Well\\", \\"Precious\\" and \\"Nothing's Impossible\\".     \\"Suffer Well\\" is the best of the Gahan-penned tracks in terms of sheer momentum and single-release quality. It has a highly singable chorus and enjoyably crunchy guitar that moves it forwards nicely. \\"Nothings Impossible\\" is a grower, and while it never gets off the ground in a big way, also because of Dave's filtered singing, the submerged monochrome quality is a large part of its appeal. It is darkly optimistic and has a 'we're in the gutter but looking up at the stars' vibe so the dark and 'twinkly' production suits it well. \\"Precious\\", I think, is the best single Depeche Mode have released since some of the singles that were released off Ultra. It's simultaneously heartbreaking and generous, bittersweet and yet uplifting and Dave's singing is the perfect vehicle for it. The openness and stark production work to great effect to foreground the nakedness of the emotion in the lyric.     Though there is nothing new on offer lyrically, \\"The Sinner In Me\\" is the most exciting track production-wise, rewarding as it is in the sonic detail which drives the song and gives it its edgy atmosphere. \\"Lilian\\" and \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" are also, for me, among the tracks that make an impression but I don't like them without reservations. \\"Lilian\\" is one of the better songs on the second half of the album and is catchy, but unfortunately almost annoyingly so since it also tends towards being lightweight and formulaic. \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" has existential angst and a catchy chorus to recommend it but it's compromised somewhat by the fact that the band saw fit to revive the plastic-sounding goth noise of Exciter's \\"The Dead Of Night\\" in an attempt to lend the song some sort of appropriate drama. Don't know. . . beyond a certain point the song also doesn't really 'say' very much to me.     While there's less that tugs at the heart this time (an area where Exciter, despite it's several flaws, perhaps succeeded more) it's generally skillfull the way they've sometimes taken elements of their past to create something new without also going too far with it. \\"Precious\\", for instance, echoes \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" but not in a way which feels like a rip off. There are other examples, too, like \\"John The Revelator\\" for instance. While it does feel more calculated this time around, it's also clever the way the gospel feel of Songs Of Faith And Devotion is briefly revived in the chorus. The song itself however, while succeeding as a short, broody stomper, is not as sophisticated or thought-provoking as songs they've done before when venturing into similar territory like \\"Personal Jesus\\" or \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\".     The other difficulty I have with PTA is that, as with Exciter, there are again problems in the 'editing-of-lyrics' department as some of the songs are compromised by patchy or excessively self-indulgent lyrics (the Gore-sung ballads are a prime example.) Also, since Exciter, Depeche Mode seem incapable of making albums that deliver right the way through. Granted, there are also weak songs on their past albums but their albums before Exciter are generally much more solid from end to end. Only the first half of PTA offers some sort of consistency. PTA is also, unfortunately, poorly mastered, dynamic range in the recording having been sacrificed for the sake of loudness.     In the end, as I see it, PTA is more of a stylistic return for the band rather than being \\"their best since Violator\\" or, as some have said, \\"the emperor's new clothes\\". It's 'Depeche Mode reclaiming Depeche Mode', if you like - enjoyable on its own terms, and often well crafted and yielding some good songs - but, rather like Exciter, it doesn't have a consistently strong set of songs comparable to the best of their past work despite also referencing as well as trying to update their musical past. It's a good effort where it succeeds and has elements of what makes Depeche Mode special but it isn't one of their essential albums.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney has produced an excellent album album. It actually takes a few listens. Good songwriting and production. I think the stand tracks are: \\"How Kind Of You\\", \\"Friends To Go\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\", but there is nothing weak here. He avoids the banal lyrics that tend to adorn his lesser works. These songs hold the line at sensitive and sad, rather than sappy.  <br />Highly recommended!

You found a way to communicate to me on a level somewhere between awareness and the sub-conscious; Aeroplane resonates with me in a way I don't fully understand.<br /><br />After listenting last night to \\"Live at Jittery Joe's\\" (a recording of Jeff playing alone for friends at a coffee house) for the first time, I realized how much Aeroplane was your own creation and how much it must have taken out of you to create it. I have often wished you were following-up on Aeroplane with a new CD every couple of years, but that is asking too much. Aeroplane was enough. Thank you.<br /><br />I don't know what fear or pain drove you away from recording and performing, but I hope you have found peace.<br /><br />Now for the review:<br /><br />Neutral Milk Hotel is the best of the Elephant 6 bands and Aeroplane is the best of NMH. I found the NMH after sampling other E6ers--Olivia Tremor Control, Apples in Stereo, Elf Power, Circulatory System, Sunshine Fix, Beulah. Neutral Milk Hotel is definitely the folk end of the E6 spectrum.<br /><br />What NMH shares with the other E6 bands is a lo-fi approach to recording, unexpected instruments (saw, bagpipes, Indonesion bells?), unexpected influences (New Orlean funeral marches, Anne Frank), and a belief that music can open up a new consciousness (isn't that what psychedelic means?).<br /><br />NMH inherited genes from Dylan, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. With Jeff and NMH out of the business, I have spent months looking for bands who can fill the NMH void. There aren't any. Those who have come closest are the Arcade Fire, the Decembrists, and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.<br /><br />After more than a year, I listen to \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" almost weekly. It is raw, sincere, surreal, cathartic, earthy, and trascendent. Buy it. If after five listens it hasn't taken root in your soul, you may not be human.the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" almost weekly.

B00001U03Q|5.0|Eric Clapton over the years has actually become more popular.  In the 60's his music was more underground but today is more mainstream.  The psychedelic lead guitarist of Cream is now a household name that even wins Grammys.  Clapton has done some great work in the last 20 years including Tears In Heaven, If I Could Change the World, Running on Faith and a whole host of others.  If you are a Clapton fan you have heard these songs before.  One song of note that appears on this CD and appears nowhere else is Blue Eyes Blue. Blue Eyes Blue is another classic acoustic song in the tradition of Tears in Heaven among others.  The one song that does not appear here that should was the \\"B\\" side of If I Could Change the World. On that single he did a killer instrumental version of Danny Boy that only appears on the single. If you want some greatest hits or you want to introduce yourself to Clapton this is a great way to start
B00008G9JM|5.0|Actually 4 1/2 stars . A Passion Play is a bit more melodic than Thick As A Brick .There is less of Martin Barres guitar and more of John Evans synth . The themes of the album are quite similar to Thick ' ... one wonders if Gerald Bostock had a hand in penning the lyrics , although The Hare Who Lost His Spec-a-ticles would suggest otherwise . I've heard a lot of people mentioning the fact that Jethro Tull should be in The Rock And Roll Hall of Fame . Its albums like Passion Play that will probably keep them out . All of rocks royalty from the Stones to the Clash To Zepp to Aerosmith couldnt , in their wildest dreams come up with something as imaginative as Passion Play . And while these and future hall of famers like Nirvana and Metallica are at the podium having thier butts kissed by the industry and thier peers ...I'll be sittin at home grinning over the fact that Tull is not a part of this nonsense .
B000002G85|3.0|in 1970 Eric Clapton came out with his first solo album.  What you have here is him recording essentially with Delaney and Bonnie's band.  The songs of note on this album are his version of After Midnight which to this day is one of his classics.  He also has his classic Let It Rain on this album  Easy Now is another fine acoustic song I would recommend that is on this CD.  Bottle of Red Wine is a good Rocker with a short but sweet guitar solo.  For a first effort not a bad album.
0804106304|4.0|Okay, a confession... the title was just to get you to read this review. In reality, I really liked The Joy Luck Club. Although I know there must be better novels out there, simply because it seems there is always something better to read, The Joy Luck Club is one of the best reads I have had in a long time. As modern novels go, it is very positive and encouraging despite the difficult circumstances in which the characters find themselves. Furthermore, The Joy Luck Club has enhanced my understanding of mother/daughter relationships. Amazingly, it did this without being preachy or overly sentimental.<br /><br />  As I have understood, the top complaints about this novel are that it is too critical of the male sex and that it does not portray Chinese culture very accurately. Although I cannot speak about the accuracy of the book's portrayal of Chinese culture, not being very familiar with this topic, I can speak about the novel's portrayal of men. As a man, I do not feel that The Joy Luck Club bashes males or treats them in any way unfairly. That said, I should qualify my statement by letting my readers know that I have recently finished The Color Purple, which might affect (not to say color) my perspective on this subject. In my opinion, if Amy Tan committed any sin in this area, it would have to be the fact that she simply does not have any central male characters. It must be understood that this novel is not about men. There are several rather contemptible characters that are men, but there are also several women who come across as rather awful people. Amy Tan's purpose is not to disrespect the male gender.<br /><br /> The decision of whether or not to read a novel ultimately comes down to whether you think you will enjoy it or not. Unfortunately, you often have to read a novel first in order to discover if you find it enjoyable. It's kind of a catch-22. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is. My advice is not to set up unreasonable standards for this book after hearing all the hype and glowing reviews. Instead, give this novel a chance. Sit back, relax, and enjoy a good read.aring all the hype and glowing reviews. Instead, give this novel a chance. Sit back, relax, and enjoy a good read. <br />
B00004Y6NK|4.0|Eric Clapton at this point added Nathan East and Greg Phillenganes, who have both backed Michael Jackson. The result was a very funky CD. <br />Its In The Way That You Use It was recorded as a soundtrack number for a Tom Cruise movie. It had a lot of air time on MTV when it came out. <br />I will hit the highlights. Bad Influence is a cover of the Robert Cray song. Clapton does it very close to the way Cray recorded it. Miss You is a strong Rocker with some great guitar. <br />Holy Mother is the best song on the CD. This song is absolutely haunting, and shows you the pain he went thru at some point. <br />Behind the Mask is another great song. <br />This is not one of his best, but certainly worth the money it coasts. This is for collectors like me.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I think someone else might have said \\"leave it to Madonna to do it again\\".  I would agree as she has with her latest disc here, a 12 song non-stop trip back through time into early disco while experimenting with futuristic trance and electro dance music. <br />\\"Hung Up\\"-wow, what a treat, especially if you're a true Abba fan as I and instantly recognized the \\"Gimme Gimme A Man After Midnight\\" hook.  Madonna so cleverly combines the hook with the catchiest lyrics and dance groove to make me want to play this song over and over.  Some may disagree, but I think this is one of the most enjoyable tunes that has come out in a long time, it's pure ear candy. <br />Following up this headliner are my favorites \\"Sorry\\", a club stomper with a fabulous catchy chorus, and \\"How High\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Let It Will Be\\" and a special surprise at the end \\"Like It Or Not\\" which has a classy accept me or don't chorus which I truly respect.   <br />The good news for me and so many other Madonna fans who have written positive reviews is that we truly like it! <br />This is a true escape CD to pop in and I dare you to try to listen to this disc and stay still, for me, it just doesn't work! <br />Enjoy! <br />
B00004Y6NM|4.0|Behind the Sun was Eric Claptons second album on Duck records.  At this time he is moving into a new direction.  This is his first album with Nathan East and Greg Phillinganes.  Nathan East has been with Eric Clapton ever since.  On this CD you have the hit song Forever Man which also had a video that had alot of playing time on MTV at the time.  Other songs of note are She's Waiting , Same Old Blues, Tangled in Love and a cover of the song Knock on Wood. Just like a Prisoner is haunting and has a killer guitar solo as well.  Phil Collins also works with Clapton on this CD and adds drums as well.  This is a must for any Clapton fan and a great album.  I would recommend this to anyone
B000BO0LLS|1.0|This is just another cheap move by MC's company to milk the cow and abuse it's loyal fans by releasing for the 4th time (yes, 4 times) the same album with additional remixes. <br /> <br />And to milk the cow even more, there's 2 versions of the ultra-platinum edition, one with only the new CD and one with a DVD with 4 of her videos (yet again the same songs, only that now I can watch her move 2 steps...) and a documentary (that is frickin' hard to activate) <br /> <br />Waste of money. Buy her Christmas album instead which is more appropiate for this seasons.
B000002G8J|3.0|Slowhand was one of the finest albums of his career. This is the follow up. Eric is in a very laid back state of mind. <br />Bob Dylan contributes two songs to this albun. Walk out in the Rain and If I dont be there by Morning. Both are strong Dylan songs. <br />Early in the Morning is Clapton playing slow blues. I love it when he plays slow blues.  <br />Promises actually hit the charts in the late 70.s. It was a moderate success for him. I think it topped out at aroud #10. <br />Golden Ring is a fine acoustic piece and Tulsa Time with its slide guitar is probably the best song on the album. <br />This is one of those albums that is not great but has a few great songs, for collectors only.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|Some browncoats I know really wanted me to go see this film. They were bugging everyone they knew about it. I wanted to see it anyway and went along to shut them up. They told me I wouldn't \\"get it\\" (not being a browncoat, and all) and then insisted on telling me all the bits I should be laughing at. They reckoned I'd laugh in all the wrong places otherwise. When we came out of the theater I told them I didn't really enjoy it and couldn't get excited like them. When they realised I wasn't joking they didn't like it one bit and got real cranky.  <br /> <br />I guess I was unlucky not to see it in better circumstances but I still don't think it's as great as some people say. It was an okay film. It had a couple of good set-pieces but I thought it was a bit derivative. The characters didn't reach out to me and the jokes weren't as funny as I kept being told they were. If you like sci-fi you should check it out. If you don't like sci-fi I don't guess you'll be reading this anyway.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Eric Clapton for years has recorded song by Robert Johnson. The two together seem like a natural fit. <br />If you study Clapton over the years he does fragments of Robert Johnson songs. <br />Crossroads for instance is made up of lyrics from Crossroads Blues and Traveling Riverside Blues. <br />Now you are able to hear Clapton sing the lyrics they way they were originally written. <br />This is Claptons intrepreation of Robert Johnsons' music. <br />Many of the guitar riffs are taken from songs already recorded by Clapton. What appeals to me is the \\"Down Home\\" atmosphere this album has. <br />You feel like Clapton is on the porch playing blues guitar for you. <br />This is Mississippi Delta Blues the way Robert Johnson intended it. <br />Clapton along with Billy Preston are a lethal combination. <br />They're Red Hot shows Billy Preston playing the way we all know he can. Clapton appears to be very relaxed. <br />The next song of note is Me and the Devil Blues. I think that back then blues players called their women devils. With the legand of the Crossroads you wonder though. <br />The version of Travelin Riverside Blues is much more interesting than the version Led Zeppelin did. <br />Stop Breaking Down which was also covered by the Rolling Stones is very strong also. <br />Kindhearted Woman has been released before, this version is not new, in my mind its recycled. <br />The best three songs on the CD are Come On In My Kitchen, If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day which Clapton recorded before as Rollin and Tumblin. This is the entire song though. <br />Love in vain also appears here and is entirely different than the version by the Rolling Stones, Claptons version is much more like Johnsons' <br />Hell Hound on My Trail I guess is about the torment he feels and is one of the \\"Gems\\" on the CD. <br />Clapton plays a lot of blues slide guitar and Billy Preston is phenominal on keyboards. <br />This CD is one of Claptons career albums and a must for any blues fanor any Robert Johnson fan. This is Mississippi Delta Blues at its very best........ENJOY
B000002OX7|5.0|WHO'S NEXT RELEASED IN 1971 IS A CLASSIC ROCK MASTERPIECE. THIS IS THE ALBUM WHERE THE WHO BROUGHT THE SOUND OF THEIR HIGH POWERED LIVE ACT TO THE STUDIO. THE DRUMS AND BASS ARE POWERFUL WHILE TOWNSEND'S PLAYING IS AT HIS BEST AND DALTRY SOUNDS GREAT.DON'T BOTHER WITH THE LAME REVIEW SLAMMING THE MEMBERS FOR HOW THEY LIVED THEIR LIVES. IT'S THE MUSIC PEOPLE. LIFE MAY END BUT THE SONG IS NEVER TRULY OVER. THE ALBUM IS WELL PRODUCED HAS GREAT MELODIES WITH GREAT SONGS. BABA O'RILEY, WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN, BARGIN, ITS ALL GOOD HERE.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I think this movie blew away Star Wars, which had become some ADHD fight fantasy.<br /><br />I rarely saw any sort of advertising in the months leading up to the theatrical release, and many people I know had no idea what it was when it appeared at the theater. I would imagine many people I don't know felt the same way and didn't bother to watch it.<br /><br />I will admit that I'm a browncoat, own the DVD series, and had a pretty good time at this movie, already knowing the backstory... went three times, in fact.<br /><br />I'd like to see this DVD do the same as the format did for the series. If not, I'll have to settle for fanfic.
B000AGTPUA|2.0|As a technological feat, it has its moments.  In spite of the weirdly passive storyline, the atmosphere of snow and night and travel has a kind of kinetic beauty.  But there's no getting around the story, which, in film and book, is the product of reactionary minds.  Why this boy?  Why now?  Why the nauseatingly patriarchal and self-congratulatory Santa?  Why the masses of worshipping elves?  It's all very \\"Triumph of the Will\\" -- \\"Metropolis\\" with a Christmas Tree.   <br /> <br />Actually, the irrationality of giving the first present of Christmas to the boy is even more pronounced in the film, in spite of the filmmakers' effort to make him a worthy and active hero.  The little African American girl (the children aren't even dignified with names), the real greatheart of the story, is condescendingly dismissed by Santa, as if she were a faithful cook or a maid when, in fact, she's the one who should have been given the present.  Revolting. <br /> <br />The message of the film is, of course, dictatorial: Believe.  That's an imperative, folks, and the implication is that if you don't you'll go to hell.  We've heard that song before.  This is a movie for people who think the capital gains tax should be eliminated, that people are rich and successful because God loves them more than He loves others, and who blindly support the oligarchic horrors of the current administration in Washington. <br /> <br />Achtung, baby, and good night.                <br />
B000BJS4OY|4.0|To begin with, this is a wonderful package. An unreleased live DVD of Springsteen's 1975 Concert in London, a well done \\"making of\\" DVD, a book of unreleased photos, and the reason for the existance of this package, \\"Born To Run\\" itself, completely remastered. Most Springsteen fans know that \\"Born To Run\\" was remastered before, back in the early nineties on a gold disc using Sony's SBM method. It was a big improvement over the original disc. Naturally, one would expect the current remastering to go even further sonically. It does and it doesn't. While the disc sounds brighter and less muddied, there is also an increase in distortion which, sad to say, is to be expected. The master tapes are, after all, 30 years old, and Springsteen was laboring to create a \\"Wall of Sound\\" presentation for these songs. When you start peeling layers away, funny things are going to happen. There may have been a better result if this project had been handled by a group like Mobile Fidelity, but it is what it is.  The big question for Springsteen fans is if this marks the beginning of a complete, sorely needed remastering of the rest of his catalog, similar to what was done for Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. An artist of Springsteen's stature and impact certainly rates the royal treatment when it comes to reissues; hopefully \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\" will be the first step.
B000AL730O|4.0|I just wanted to give an updated review... I have now listened to the CD (maybe 20-30 times), My favorites on the CD has changed quite often but I tend to go back and forth on: <br />a. How Kind of You, b. At the Mercy, c. Friends to Go, d. Too  much Rain and e. A certain softness <br /> <br />I also think now that Comfort of Love should have made the final cut on this CD. <br /> <br />Finally after watching the AOL sessions (which contains quite a few songs from this CD) I feel the whole band concert pumps some more life into the songs. I think paul should perform this entire CD live with his band (including strings and a horn section) for a TV special.  This CD is definitely a mood setter and I love it... <br /> <br />Rock On....
140004281X|3.0|This collection of stories was my introduction to Alice Munro.  The stories are  well written but, tedious at times. I read this book for a book discussion and there is lots to discuss.  I didn't look forward to  reading this book after work. The interesting thing is that the more I think about the stories, the more I appreciate them.  Except for one of the stories, the plots are really different and Munro is able to tell a person's life in a short amount of time.  I recommend this book with reservations.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I first bought The Emancipation of Mimi back in April and was very excited because it was a return to form for Mariah. But this re-release is even better. If you're just a casual fan, I would still recommend purchasing this version because you get 4 extra songs: Don't Forget Aboout Us, Makin' It Last All Night, So Lonely (One and Only Part II), and the We Belong Together (Remix). In addition, you get the music videos for: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Shake It Off, and Get Your Number. This is a great sounding CD and great DVD from start to finish. I would highly recommend this CD/DVD package.  <br /> <br />
0307276902|3.0|The story was hyped as a true story.  From the word go you can tell it's not.  I'm sure the only true thing in this book was the author's name.  If you have any medical experience, any airline experience, any real life experience, you know that this story is false.  Boo on Oprah.  She really got it wrong this time.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm not sure if people are aware, but Mariah re-released \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" on Tuesday in an expanded CD/DVD version. You get 18 songs + 4 of her music videos on DVD. The retail stores (Target, Best Buy, and Circuit City) have it on sale until Sunday for $11.99. Refer to your Sunday circulars. That's why I'm bringing this to your attention. If you buy the \\"Ultra Platinum Edition,\\" you'll get Mariah's current hit \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" and the video for her #1 hit \\"We Belong Together.\\" Plus 3 other great songs and videos for \\"It's Like That,\\" Shake It Off\\", and \\"Get Your Number.\\" If you're buying for the holidays, you should get the \\"Ultra Platinum Edition\\" while it's on sale.
B000056K04|3.0|Although a huge fan of DMB since before they were DMB, I am disappointed with Everyday.  Note to self:  This is what happens when you change producers.  Many of these songs should have been on Remember Two Things or Recently.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Madonna has never been 100 % original. She has always borrowed ideas from other artists but she usually masked those ideas with her own originality.  Unfortunately, on this album, she does not even hide her blatant borrowing and it seems she is running out of steam. She borrows ideas from ABBA, The Jacksons, Kylie, The Police, GoldFrapp, and Donna Summer. She even borrows ideas from her former glorious self. Part of Madonna's problem is she is relying too heavily on Euro Pop. Since Ray of Light, Madonna has used Euro Pop to mask other things she has been lacking. What's lacking are passion and energy in her voice and meaningful and creative lyrics. Clearly, Madonna at 47 is at a crossroad...she needs to make a decision on continuing to be Queen of Pop or just another Euro Pop female singer. Having said that, this cd is not bad but it is not to the level that we expect from Queen Madonna. <br /> <br />The best songs in my opinion are Get Together (because it sounds like vintage Madonna), Future Lovers (the most futuristic song on the album that owes a lot to Donna Summer's I Feel Love), Forbidden Love (yes, it is true Kylie took a lot of ideas from Madonna and on this song Madonna does a reverse), and Sorry (a great bass line from the 70s Jackson). The other songs sound like filters. I do not regret buying this cd...I enjoy it. But while I still listen to Madonna's earlier materials (except for AI)...this album will find its way to my basement in the near future. <br />
0451529065|4.0|It's really amazing how polarized people's opinions of this book are!  Whether you accept evolution or not though, it would be foolish not to read Origin of Species if you expect to have an informed opinion on the subject.  I gave it only 4 stars because it gets pretty dry in places, however I definitely recommend reading this book.  Reading it two or three times would be an even better idea.
0684833395|4.0|if you liked momento, you must love catch-22...this book is like a piece of art,even if you don't like to read books, you are going to be addicted to it.Some reads it over 10 times to understand how it connects to real life, but some others read it for the first time to comprehend it. <br />
B00026WU64|5.0|In my opinion this is Bob Dylan's best.  If you prefer Dylan's early pre-electric material then perhaps you will agree.  I don't even like \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" or \\"Masters of War\\" but all the other songs on this disc are excellent, and more than make up for the ones I'm not in to.  I absolutely love the mildly sarcastic and jaded style of humor that he displays so well in \\"Talkin' World War III Blues.\\"  Other songs like \\"Girl from the North Country,\\" are just nice to listen to, and not surprisingly have been widely covered by artists ranging from Altan to Rod Stewart.  This CD is also my favorite Dylan because of the wild and sometimes rythmic sounds he pulls and pushes from his harmonica so sporadically.  It's something you can listen to over and over again and still appreciate.  Highly recommended to folk and Dylan fans.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I believe this album is like one of those movies you hear so much about and see pictures in the cover of magazines and then when you buy the ticket and sit down at the theater right in the middle of the movie you realize this was another marketing plot to sell an average or mediocre product. The album's best cut are 'Hung Up' and 'Isaac', the rest is not so good. <br /> <br /> From her most recent work, 'Bedtime Stories' is her best 5 star album following 'Ray of Life' and 'Music', this album is not at the same level at all.  <br />If you want to hear some good music this year by a pop icon get Sinead O'Connor's new reggae album 'Throw Down your Arms' its brilliant and a more genuine effort than Madonna's hyped work.. and it is on sale here at amazon.

B000002IAS|5.0|So many people have discovered this album by accident, usually attracted by 'with Eric Clapton' under the title. Some great raunch and R&B on this album, it's a blast to listen to. A little sloppy at times, but that's what live shows were like before everyone copped an attitude and shows became choreographed and epic fireworks displays. <br /> <br />But more than just a recording back when rock was pure, this is a companion to the best albums of '70 and '71. Delany & Bonnie's collection of friends gave Eric Clapton the comfort level and confidence to become their frontman as Derek and the Dominoes (Layla, Bell Bottom Blues, I Looked Away, Badge, etc). The same cast served as George Harrison's band for All Things Must Pass, then toured as Mad Dogs & Englishmen with Joe Cocker.  <br /> <br />Clapton would later cover some of JJ Cale's songs (he's not on this album, though) like \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\", and \\"After Midnisght\\" ... Mark Knopfler would copy Cale's guitar licks to produce Dire Straits' most distinctive music. Harrison called on these friendsa and others to play the songs again in the Concert for Bangladesh, which created the benefit rock concert, launched Billy Preston and Leon Russell and brought Bob Dylan out of seclusion. <br /> <br />And it all started with this party of a tour...
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I never much liked George Clooney until I saw this film and realized how wildly funny he can be.  His compulsive haircare and the fit he pitches over FOP vs. Dapper Dan just kill me!  The acting is great by all though, and the characters are truly priceless!  I am tempted to describe all my favorite bits from the movie here, but it would just be way too much writing.  In my opinion, the best humor in this film is subdued, but it is also extremely clever and biting.  I also appreciate the loose connections with actual events and people from the period: Tommy (Robert) Johnson at the crossroads, George (Baby Face) Nelson, TVA projects, etc.  It probably helps if you don't hate old-time music and bluegrass, but being steeped in it myself I really couldn't say.  For me, purchasing this movie was worthwhile, because I never get tired of watching it.  I hope you'll like it too.
B00025ETIW|2.0|I must say, this album was a guilty plesure for a little while. I think theres are well written pop rock songs. good hooks and everything but see this band live and it will change your opinion. I saw them last year open for Lost Prophets and they SUCKED so bad! It made me realize just how much of this album is production. The singer is TONE DEAF!!! He can't sing for his life! The drummer plays the same beat over and over again the guitarists have no idea what rythem is and the bassist may as well be playing a mop. This band is a train wreck live! MCR got lucky they got their songs produced this well! because before this album all they had going for them was their straigt out of hot topic looks. Download this album or buy it used because its not awful but for the love of god, don't see them live or pick up the first album because both of those experiences are quite painful.
B0009MAP90|5.0|For me it is really rare to find an album where I like every song.  This is one of those few.  In my opinion this is an extremely close second place to the Frewheelin' album for Bob Dylan's very best.  If you like Dylan's older acoustic/folksy songs then you will not be disappointed in this.
0316666343|3.0|Every now and then, people at my job will leave books available for anyone to read, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was one of them.  I picked it up and started to read, every chance I had at work (lunch, after work), I went through the book.  The story was tragic, sad, mournful.  But, it was also funny and uplifting.  I felt that it was well written and painted the mental pictures very well.  Get a copy at a good price and decide for yourself!  Three stars!  P.S., when I finished the book, I put it back for someone else to read/enjoy!!  It is a good book!!
6301969588|4.0|Even people jaded by the extreme \\"realism\\" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.
B00000IPAX|5.0|blink 182 is tied with guns n'roses for the greatest band in the world, seriously. i dont know who this idiot \\"jessica\\" is, but she is wrong in every sense. blink has never been about the money, its always been about the music. granted, they are a bit perverted, but they are ORIGINAL pop-punk. i mean alot of people will take them and group them in with simple plan, yellowcard, sugarcult. let me set this straight, all those little \\"punk\\" boy-bands are all blink 182 wanna-bes, and YOU KNOW IT!! tom delonge, (and that lip ring!!) with his style and amazing voice and ability to make the most boring chord progression musical magic and pure catchiness is something truly beautiful. i HIGHLY reccomend this album, especially if youre buying your first blink cd, this one is incredible. then get \\"take off your pants and jacket\\", then \\"blink 182\\", the new self-titled, and then dude ranch. blink 182, there is no other.
B000093BDX|3.0|This album is a collection of the standard Beach Boys hits that everyone expects such as \\"Surfin USA\\", \\"I Get Around\\", \\"California Girls\\", etc. It also includes some horrible late 70s hits like \\"Good Timin\\". \\"Come Go With Me\\", \\"Rock and Roll Music\\". It also includes the 3 singles from Pet Sounds(\\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"Sloop John B\\"), and some pretty good late 60s songs, 2 of which were supposed to be on the unfinished Beach Boys album \\"SMiLE\\". (\\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\" were the ones slated for release on SMiLE. \\"Darlin\\", \\"Wild Honey\\", and \\"I Can Hear Music\\" are also some welcome selections on this compilation.) Missing are: some of the great songs from the Boys first greatest hits album Endless Summer (\\"Let Him Run Wild\\", \\"Wendy\\", \\"You're So Good To Me\\", \\"All Summer Long\\", \\"Catch a Wave\\", \\"Girl Don't Tell Me\\", \\"The Girls on the Beach\\", \\"The Warmth of the Sun\\"), also missing are songs from Freinds, Sunflower, Holland, Surf's Up, and Carl and the Passions.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|dude, g'n'r is possibly the greatest band ever. followed closely by blink 182, mind you ;). seriously, you cant beat anything about them, their style (the tight leather, the hair, the bandanas), their looks, their MUSIC, their vocals, their guitar (SLASH!!!) now of course you cant contain their greatness in a single album, but for the casual listen, i highly reccomend this disk. if youre really into Good Music and you know it, get as many of their albums as possible. These were the days, baby!!
B000002JKA|4.0|This is a great album, but there are too many filler tracks. But first I'll go through the songs worth listening to: <br />Caught in a Web - Fantastic riffing from John, and Kevin adds a good backdrop with the keyboards. <br />Erotomania - Listen to this for the incredible string skipping solo from Petrucci. <br />Voices - Moody, intense, and climactic.  <br />The Mirror - Sweet. <br />Lie - Sweet. <br />Scarred - Epic and amazing. <br />Space Dye Vest - Good album closer, and a sort of valediction from Kevin Moore to exit the band. <br /> <br />The problem with most of the weak songs is that they're lame ballads. Now, I want to make it known that I'm not a ballad hater type of person. But some of the songs on this album just make me wanna gag. <br />6:00 - I don't hate it per se, but I've just never been able to get into it. <br />Innocence Faded - Ugh. Lame cheesy chorus. <br />The Silent Man - This is even worse. Bad lyrics, bad use of the acoustic guitar... <br />Lifting Shadows Off a Dream - ...nah.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions kicks arse! Once again, Madonna proves her exceptional talent and her incredible grip on the pulse of what is hot in music. Confessions may be a \\"throw back to disco days\\", as some reviewers will say, but I just don't agree. Confessions gives us all a taste of the now and future of dance music. Dig in and enjoy!
B00005J6SZ|3.0|Oh yeah, the wedding dress. MTV Music Awards 1985? What do you mean you don't remember? I remember and I was like two years old. Thats right, two years old and I already had the hots for Madonna- how could you not when she was dry humping the stage on live television?<br /><br />The reason that this album made Madonna so huge was due to the fact that in 1985 she was the only pop icon that had any balls. Madonna pushed the envelope all along the way, but this album (her second) had a lot more to say than her first did. Sure MATERIAL GIRL is a wretched song (Me and Madonna  both agree that we HATE this song)but there are a lot of solid hits here.<br /><br />MADONNA made her music exciting. Thats why she was so popular. She excited her audience,thats what its all about. Rock and roll. She became the bar for everything else pop to be based on with LIKE A VIRGIN, and not a single one of these bubble gum girls have ever touched the realm of this album.<br /><br />Personally this is my least favorite MADONNA album; its the only one that I would be embarrassed to be caught listening to by myself. Later stuff is all ok, this album is just to girly gum music. MADONNA is mad hot though in that wedding dress!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|From my blog:<br /><br />http;//theglenblog.blogspot.com<br /><br />Bruce Springsteen's 30th Anniversary edition of Born To Run was released this week.<br /><br />And it is incredible.<br /><br />Did I mention I love Bruce Springsteen?<br /><br />It's hard to believe it's been 30 years since I was basically dragged out to see Bruce on the Born To Run tour back in 1975.<br /><br />Of course I had heard the album. I worked in a record store, and there was essentially no escaping Born To Run that year. It was everywhere. Rolling Stone was boldly proclaiming this guy as \\"the future of rock and roll\\". Similiarly bold pronouncements could be found in cover stories for both Time and Newsweek. The hype was absolutely enormous. And it was everywhere.<br /><br />Personally, I thought the album was decent enough. Basically equal parts Dylan; Phil Spector; and Roy Orbison, the influences we're the right ones, and Born To Run had a cool \\"thoughtful street poet\\" sort of vibe to it...even if the cinematic scope of some of the songwriting was a bit, well \\"dramatic\\" and none too subtly overwrought. My own tastes in 1975 veered more towards the prog rock found on albums like Genesis \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" anyway.<br /><br />But a free ticket to see \\"the future of rock and roll\\" was still a no-brainer.<br /><br />30 years (and some 31 Springsteen concerts I have seen since that life changing night in 1975) later, and I am still thanking Jerry Fritzmann (God rest his soul) for that ticket.<br /><br />Bruce and the E Street Band's performance at the Paramount Theatre that night not only did live up to all of the hype (no small task), it actually surpassed it. Not since I saw the Beatles on TV as a seven year old boy did a single rock and roll performance leave such a lasting impact on me.<br /><br />Springsteen actually DID become the \\"rock and roll future\\" Rolling Stone had so boldly predicted, although it would be several years later before the public would fully catch up to the fact.<br /><br />The 30 year Born To Run commemorative boxed set released this week is simply a beautiful package. The set contains a newly remastered version of the CD, that faithfully recreates the original package...right down to the original gatefold sleeve artwork and even the disc itself...presented as a \\"black vinyl\\" duplicate of the original LP. It even has \\"grooves\\".<br /><br />The sound in it's remastered version brings new dimension and clarity to the original as well. The multi-layered \\"wall of sound\\" leaps out at you in crisp new detail here. There is also a very well done documentary DVD on the making of the landmark album, with original footage, new interviews with present and past band members, and some choice performance footage from a few years earlier.<br /><br />But what brought the memories flooding back for me is the remarkable DVD of a complete 1975 show from London's Hammersmith Odeon. Bruce has remarked often in interviews that he was not fond of the performance that night (he offers a new, revised perspective in the liner notes here).<br /><br />Here, on the shows first few songs I found myself in agreement with Bruce's original assessment. Bruce and the band are still lacking some of the \\"stagecraft\\" (though the chemistry, especially between Bruce and Clarence Clemons is undeniable) that they would hone to diamond like perfection on later tours. The band also looks somewhat ridiculous viewed thirty years later. With their matching wide brim hats, disco lapels (is that actually a pink suit Soprano Steve Van Zandt is wearing?), and even a bearded Max Weinberg sporting what looks suspiciously like a short mullet. Bruce's wool stocking cap is also an oddly chosen stage prop in retrospect.<br /><br />But about halfway through, the band catches fire and you can start to see why they became arguably the best live band in the world. On a scorching \\"Kittys Back\\" especially, the band takes off an an extended jazz improvisation with Roy Bittan attacking the ivories like a madman as Max pounds away a backbeat that never loses a step.<br /><br />I've gotten a lot of flack from my friends over the years because of my \\"obsession\\" with Bruce Springsteen. And I have to admit I occasionally question my own sanity over things like travelling clear across the country just to catch one of his shows (which I've done more than once).<br /><br />But rediscovering the Born To Run album and tour on this great commemorative box makes it crystal clear just what it was, and still is, about Springsteen that makes me believe in the promise of Thunder Road's \\"One Last Chance To Make it Real\\".<br /><br />Did I mention I love Bruce Springsteen?nded jazz improvisation with Roy Bittan attacking the ivories like a madman as Max pounds away a backbeat that never loses a step.  <br /> <br />I've gotten a lot of flack from my friends over the years because of my \\"obsession\\" with Bruce Springsteen.

B000002MUW|5.0|I'm putting up one more for MADONNA before I go to bed. BEDTIME STORIES, secretly (sshhhh) I am a fan of this album. It's very catchy and very sexy. I like the songs on this album because they are very structured and diverse. Its not a bunch of pop, or techno beats. This is from her earl-mid nineties when she got very into her writing. Remember USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND? Thats not on here, but you understand... its not all about dance songs. Its about songs. This album is like a bedtime story, its nice and mellow, you got that blues band backing her a little on SECRET. Her voice is very mature sounding on this one, she could seduce the pants off of a priest in church with this stuff. She writes a lot of personal type stuff and that makes this one very versatile and easy to listen to. Cool.<br /><br />When I was about fifteen the band I was in decided to play a set completley dedicated to this KITTEN. The songs covered from this album were SECRET (its a great song, man!) and INSIDE OF ME. It was pretty frigin' rockin!<br /><br />MADONNA you can read me a bedtime story anytime you like! Please...
0425188809|1.0|In reading the reviews of this book, I thought to myself, \\"Wow! One of his Best?  I've got to read that one!\\"  Now that I've finished the book (which although I wanted to put it down on multiple occasion, but slogged through only so that I could write an honest review), I must choose my words carefully to get across the right message...<br /><br />  THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!  There's no suspense in a book when you can guess (on or about page 40) exactly how it's going to end.  But that's not the worst part about this book.<br /><br />  The worst part about this book is that all of the main characters are pathetic, cheesy, predictable and borderline mentally retarded.  Einstein, the dog, was especially terrible.  It wasn't so much the concept of a super-intelligent genetically engineered golden retriever that was bad, instead the dialogue between the dog and Travis/Nora is so sappy, cheesy (yes, i realize i've used this term twice already) and contrived that it made me nauseous.  The final nail in the coffin was towards the end of the book when it spells out \\"HOME IS WHERE THE WEENIES IS\\".  So awful.<br /><br />  The thing that really upsets me about this book is that it took me about three days to read.  That time I spent reading this book is time that I will never be able to regain.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK!  IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE...JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE.<br /><br />  NEGATIVE 5 STARS!!!!
B00008WT5J|5.0|The title track is basically the only \\"new\\" song on this album, other than the two instrumentals. If you are unaware this is the soundtrack to MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, the movie that was actually directed by Stephen King himself. The movie is the balls, man, if you've never seen it. King, notoriously a huge AC/DC fan himself contacted these guys to write a score for the movie that he was putting together at the time, and what evolved was the song WHO MADE WHO.<br /><br />PISSER! If you think about, this song probably contains the most thought provoking AC/DC lyrics that there ever were. It is based on the movie, which is about an evil spirit that brings machines to life (its sooo good, did I mention that yet?). The song in similar vein basically is about how one could believe machines are taking over but in the end we are human f'in beings for gods sake and how are machines gonna destroy us? WE RULE! WE RULE THE FOOD CHAIN! WE RULE THE FRIGGIN' WORLD! Computers? Computers are fags. They ain't got nothing! That goes for you too robots! By the way, the boys are IN the movie too, as themselves. They actually get killed by the demon (you gotta see the movie man!)<br /><br />As for this album, it rocks A TON! The only problem is that its all previously released songs from other albums... but hey, casual liteners no doubt will dig. Its like buying a greatest hits almost. The songs are mainly from the eighties (all excellent tracks though) except for RIDE ON, the only BON SCOTT track represented here from Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (that happens to be MY favorite album, you should check THAT out.)
B000BO0LLS|1.0|1. Yes, it's the fourth release: \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\", \\"The Emancipation of Mimi: Limited Edition\\", \\"The Emancipation of Mimi: Ultra Platinum Edition\\", \\"The Emancipation of Mimi: Ultra Platinum Edition + DVD + Interview\\". That's 4 releases. <br /> <br />2. Granted, they're not all REMIXES, 1 of the 4 is, another one (So Lonely) is PART II of One & Only (which sounds the same), and the other 2 are very reminiscent of other work on the Emancipation of Mimi, now, changing the title to songs that sound the same as previous work does not make them \\"new songs\\". <br /> <br />3. Some 1-star reviewers MAY be saboteurs, others are long time fans who feel CHEATED because they bought this product already and now are betrayed by this new release which doesn't bring ANYTHING NEW. <br /> <br />4. \\"Great songs\\" is a very subjective thing, that depends entirely on the buyer. The videos are a nice add-on indeed but that doesn't make it any less cheap, because it's from songs we already heard, and it doesn't even fills the space of a DVD, at least they could've put the entire collection of videos. <br /> <br />5. I Agree, but ONLY if you don't have the original.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! is by far one of the greatest albums of something to listen to that doesn't get boring. Their lyrics are great, the songs are amazing, and I can listen to them all day long and not even think about changing the CD. In all, every song is different in its own way, and that is what is so special about Panic!.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Elizabeth, brings to the screen the story of Queen Elizabeth I, the woman responsible for transforming England into a major world power. <br />The setting is England in the 1550's, and Queen Mary is dying without an heir.  With her death in 1558, Elizabeth assumes the throne, though her grasp on power is far from secure... <br />Cate Blanchett and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!   <br />The clash between England and her adversaries (notably France, Scotland, and Spain) is as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism. <br />In addition, the film does a GREAT job of presenting both the queen and the woman in Elizabeth. <br />The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />History, Politics, and Intrigue, are all about. <br />Strongly recommended along with Elizabeth R (starring Glenda Jackson), and Mary Queen of Scots (starring Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson), Elizabeth is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4  Stars
B0000262TL|5.0|This made in Thailand version looks and sounds just as good as its more expensive Japanese cousin.  The mini-lp sleeve is cool and the tracks have been remastered well.  My favourite Eagles song is the title track and I think this and even \\"The Long Run\\" are better overall albums than \\"Hotel California.\\"  This album represents the high point of the band and all the tracks are great, not just the singles.  Highly recommended for all fans and this version is great value for money.
B0002N4ZEW|4.0|Certainly a vanity project if there ever was one, but quite listenable all the same. In the late 60's and early 70's this might have passed for a near-death experience. As it is, here in the 21st Century, it all a bit schizoid, man. But a lot of fun. Hopefully, Wilson had his tongue in cheek. Some passages soar beautifully in pre-Dark Side Pink Floyd mode. This could almost have been titled \\"Son of Meddle.\\" Anyway, you'll never consider YES's TALES excessive again. Now on to DEADWING....
B00016ZQXE|4.0|This is one of Queen's best albums as all the tracks are great and have a great flow. The recordings have been remastered but sound only a little better than the old Hollywood version which I think is due to the not so mint state of the original master.  That would explain why the sound is a little muddy on some tracks and the volume levels aren't as high as they should be on the others.  Some very good ballads like \\"It's Late\\" and \\"Spread Your Wings\\" provide a nice contrast to the rockers like \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\". A very good balance of hard and soft tunes with the usual eccentric Freddie Mercury contributions make this a worthy addition to any music lover's collection. The mini-lp sleeve packaging is also a work of art.  Recommended.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" doesn't have the quality of introspection \\"Ray of Light\\" did, or the subtle anger of \\"American Life.\\" Instead, it's a complete homage to dance-all-night clubland, with each song covered in beats so energetic and dreamy they'll make you instantly ready for Saturday night. Each song morphs into the next like a DJ set yet each track has its own message. Nothing too deep, however; this is a guilty pleasure album to be sure, meant only to be enjoyed like any good night out. After the heaviness of her last few albums, it's a nice change of pace. There's great energy throughout, ending on the mellow comedown of \\"Like It Or Not.\\" The last lines are classic Madonna, with her telling us \\"This is who I am, you can like it or not. You can love me or leave me 'cause I'm never gonna stop.\\" Let's hope not.
B000BIQKXM|4.0|After the career mishap of &#34;Allow Us To Be Frank&#34;, Westlife return to familiar territory. Big ballads, carefully selected cover versions and a duet with one of the biggest names in popular music, Diana Ross. Their first REAL album as a quartet will keep longtime fans happy, even though Bryan's voice is still missed in the mix the four lads from Ireland manage quite well. The stand out track for myself is &#34;Hit You With The Real Thing&#34;. An absolute stomper. A couple more tracks like this would have been welcome but a good effort none the less. Glad to have the boys back.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I got this album when it first came out and i admit that i didnt like it very much.  I thought it was not poppy enough or catchey enough.  I was wrong on both counts.  Confessions is pure pop/dance perfection and all the songs are VERY catchey.  I guess what i didnt like when i first got it is the fact its a dance album.  Its not an album full of True Blue or Like a Prayer pop ditties......but its still pop music though.  My favs. are Hung Up...obviously, get together, sorry, i love new york (i dare you to get the chorus to this song out of your head), jump and.....well i guess i like ALL the songs on the album.  Its about time an american artist released an album of pure pop/dance music.....and that american artist could only be Madonna.
0446577383|2.0|I had high hopes for this book because of prior pleasant experiences with some of Baldacci's thrillers.  Camel Club contains some fine story telling.  The story was at times very, very engrossing.  There are, however, some problems.  The ending is poorly crafted, confusing and especially disappointing after such a good start and middle.  The romantic subplot is thin and contrived; the post-failure depression of the secret service agent is bizarrely histrionic, terribly inconsistent with the agent's essential character as developed earlier; and the nearly super-human capabilities of the primary bad guy are like something from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Further, the shameless concept borrowing from The Dante Club (a much better written book) is painfully apparent.  (But perhaps -- as they say -- imitation is the sincerest form of flattery).  More disturbing to me than the thin subplots, and the idea borrowing from The Dante Club, however, is Baldacci's left-wing preaching.  The book is laced with liberal talking points and revisionist, speculative [anti-US] history.  It is not surprising that Baldacci names one character Oliver Stone.  An obvious homage to the well-known conspiracy peddler, Baldacci has obviously bought what Stone has sold.  Like the rest of us, Baldacci is entitled to express his views.  Unfortunately, however, Baldacci's story suffers from the periodic presentation of politically-correct pablum.
B00005Q66T|3.0|What a bad compilation job if I ever saw one.  Here was a golden opportunity to present the real hits from 1992 to 2000, but instead we get quite a few odd selections.  Missing are:    - Bad Girl  - This Used to be my Playground,   - Rain   - American Pie  - You'll See  - I'll Remember    Instead they have filled valuable space (where these could have gone) with \\"Drowned world\\", \\"What it feels like for a girl\\" and \\"Bedtime Story\\" all of which were minor hits or definite misses.    The other problem with this CD is that 90% of the songs are edited radio versions, or versions you are not familiar with.  Instead of putting the dance version of \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" which was the hit, they have opted for the slow version which kind of spoils this compilation.    It's best to stick with the individual albums and make your own compilation.  Don't let record companies dictate what are greatest hits.
0803730470|5.0|The Gruffalo is a wonderful book that is clever, smart, scary, and fun.  Unlike many children's books that are for children and children only (I tend to fall asleap reading them), this book keeps both the parent and the child racing through the book to see what the ending is.<br /><br />After two weeks, our child, 20 months old, has turned this book and the Gruffalo's Child into is \\"MUST READ\\" bedtime story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000099T2L|3.0|Dangerously  in  love  was  a  Destiny Child  song.  I  think it  was  unfare  of Beyonce to put it out to be just  hers. She made her album to better  than  Kelley's cause she's  the one that wants to be in the spotlight.And to tell the truth I think some of the songs on this album are from Destiny's Child.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|It kinda doesn't meet the HFO concert they did. They also need to get Don Felder back. The onstage magic is kind of gone. I personally also was a big fan of Meisner work. Unfortunately, Glenn Frey lost a lot of his range. if you are getting it for his music I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you like the Eagles as a whole you will be very impressed with this concert. Joe Walsh's One Day At A Time is one of the coolest songs ever. If you like Joe Walsh you should definitely buy this. The same goes for Don Henley. The concert is very good. I am just a little picky. It probably deserves 5 stars but the Frey Issue, and the lack of Meisner takes at least 1/2 star from it. Steuart Smith is okay but he doesn't interact like Don Felder did. I think that that also takes away another 1/2 star or maybe even a whole star. Still very enjoyable.
0393317552|4.0|If you already understand the principles of cultural ecology, this is a great book that neatly synthesizes the basic theories and applies them on a grand scale. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, if this is the case, then the book is a tad redundant (as far as not providing new knowledge) and does not get into the fun nitty gritty details.  (Though this is obvious as this book is claiming to tour world history in under 500 pages) <br /> <br />If you don't already understand cultural ecology, then this is potentially a great introduction.  It is a good review of the bisc priniciples.  Assuming, of course, you read the book with an intent to understand his princples.  If your only response is, why don't the tropics have a state government, then you need to reread the book, because you did not understand and missed the point entirely.  This book is not an exercize in political correctness, it is an excercize in cultural ecology. <br /> <br />The basis of his argument is only certain areas were predisposed to develop agriculture, which allows greater population, and from this comes specialization, technological advances and organized government.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I saw Confortably Numb and I have been waiting quite a while for this. This is one of the collest concerts ever! I own Led Zeppelin's How the West Was Won, The Eagles Farewell I Tour, and both Simon and Garfunkel concerts. None of them even come close to matching how engaging this concert is. A must for Pink Floyd fans. Some people say Pink Floyd lost its skill. I disagree. I think Confortably Numb is far better at this concert than the album version. (Led Zeppelin's was definitely second best and is really worth buying too!)
0321146530|1.0|Non-coders will have problems with this book because Test Driven Development is about the process of development. Specifically, this book expounds, in fine detail, the XP concept of writing tests before the implementation and how to use the results from the tests to drive another XP concept: emergent design.<br /><br />This book is excellent for any developer who wants to use the concepts of writing tests first along with emergent design and has absolutely no clue where to begin. In my 12-year development career, I have met three people falling into this category. Few competent developers can comprehend emergent design along with test first and not know where to begin.<br /><br />Read the following sample passage from the book: \\"This probably sounds a bit like magic. How do we know to think of creating an imposter here? I won't kid you - there is no formula for flashes of design insight. Ward Cunningham came up with the 'trick' a decade ago, and I haven't seen it independently duplicated yet, so it must be a pretty neat trick.\\" While reading the book, I often wished Kent Beck was sitting beside me. I wanted to hit Mr. Beck on the head with my book for each tedious chatty interlude of which, there are several per chapter.<br /><br />Combined with the noisy chatter is a tediously slow pace. Reading the book, is like standing behind a programmer who is a perfectionist. You admire what they are doing and appreciate its elegance, but you realize this person is going to produce nothing useful anytime soon.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is the second best concert I have ever seen. It falls behing Pink Floyd's Pulse concert. Jimmy Page's amazing guitar solos make this worth buying for any guitar enthusiast. If you are a percussionist John Bohnam is one of the best drummers in rock history and you should really see this. If you just like Led Zeppelin this is an amazing insight into their music.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|As a Madonna fan from day 1...from the early days of Danceteria and Funhouse in NYC...i'm dating myself.  I lie about my age...but i was there when this delicious pop-tart danced and sang and got up to do her thang... <br />An underage little club boi emerging, thanks to her, a proud and confident gay man. <br />This is one KICKIN' cd.  Anything her Madgesty utters will find itself in my cd rack...but looking at the 340 reviews on just the second day of the release says something in and of itself. <br />Madonna has grown...and so too have her true fans.  There will always be the haters but after 23 years...who cares... <br />Madonna doesn't.   <br />Just go buy this cd...here...or anywhere... <br />Put it on and prepare yourself to #1-if you're over 35...to be reminded of the early glory days...you'll find yourself smiling...and within 2 minutes and 4 seconds...dancing in your living room... <br />#2-if you're NOT over 35...finally find out what all the fuss has been about. <br />She started it...and despite what any negative reviewer says... <br />Will be around to see it end... <br />Again...I bow to her royal highness... <br />She deserves it.
B000B8QF14|4.0|Finally a full lenght live album from GD. I think it had almost all of the songs. i've seen green day many a times live and i have to say this is probably the best they have ever been live. i still think the WARNING TOUR and the Pop Disaster tour (they smoked blink)as my second and third favorites. and to the guy who said GD were from SF for the record green day is from the east bay (Oakland) not SF. That might not seem like much difference to most people but its a world of difference to most people in the bay area.

B000AP04NI|1.0|This is really funny, now that I've realised that it is much better to see this problem by the tragicomedy angle.<br /><br />After the shock reaction with the first viewing of the 2nd disc of this pack, three months ago I wrote something, published in this section, and the question was put \\"in the name of dignity\\". What a fool I was, now that I realised that Fox have done nothing till now, to offer a solution to the customers.<br /><br />I've return today to the 2nd disc and folks, I've discovered another error from the called \\"professionals\\" that had the responsabilty of this edition. The sound of the featurette THE MIRACLE OF TODD-AO is absolutely out of synchronization!!!!. It 's true. Those,like me, that have yet the pack, can verify that in the end of the referred featurette when the Harley motorcycle appears filmed by a car running at is right side, the respective sound is listened around 2 seconds earlier. The same problem that, affects all featurette, is very noticiable in the final crash too. Last week I've compared this version in DVD with the original 70mm copy that exists in the vaults of the portuguese CINEMATECA and there's no doubt; the original film is absolutely syncronized and this one is not!!<br /><br />Funny is'n it?<br /><br />Shame on you, once more, 20th Century Fox.<br /><br />João Pereira Bastos<br /><br />LISBOA PORTUGAL<br /><br />Lisboa 03 MARCH 2006
B00005JO1P|5.0|In WALK THE LINE, Joaquin Phoenix shows that he's come a long way since his role as the crazy Caesar in GLADIATOR.<br /><br />Those going into WALK THE LINE thinking it's a comprehensive film bio of Johnny Cash may perhaps come out slightly disappointed. While there's a relative brief sequence of his early years growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm, an even briefer sequence of his time in the Air Force in the early 50s, the film really begins in 1955 when, failing as a door-to-door salesman and wannabe gospel singer, he cuts a rock 'n' roll record for Sun Studios in Memphis and his career as a CW crooner takes off. The film ends with his marriage to June Carter in 1968. In between, against the backdrop of early hits, it focuses on his failed marriage to first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), his self-destructive abuse of amphetamines, and rocky relationship with singer/actress Carter (Reese Witherspoon), a twice-divorced single mother of two.<br /><br />The real treat of WALK THE LINE is watching Phoenix and Witherspoon amaze with Oscar-caliber dramatic performances. Who would have suspected that the latter was capable of anything other than light comedy?<br /><br />In case you haven't seen the film and you're wondering, Phoenix and Witherspoon themselves sing the Cash/Carter material; they're surprisingly effective. Mind you, I've never been such a Cash fan that I've possessed any of his albums, and I've only previously downloaded one of his songs (\\"City of New Orleans\\"). Indeed, when Phoenix and Witherspoon recreate the Cash/Carter duet of \\"Jackson\\", my first thought was: Didn't Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood do that?<br /><br />Coming out of the screening, my wife remarked that Phoenix sounded very much like Johnny himself. My response was a non-committal but prudent \\"Mmmm\\". Back home at the computer, I downloaded a couple more Cash songs, including his \\"Jackson\\" duet with Carter. To my ears, the real Cash had a singing voice that was slightly hoarser, and with a more pronounced slow drawl than Joaquin's version. While that doesn't detract from the actor's performance, it may cause purists to grumble.<br /><br />The film's opening scene is of two guards on a tower at Folsom Prison listening to the bass \\"thump, thump, thump\\" washing over the prison yard from the hall in which Cash is about to perform his famous concert before the inmates. My wife and I were sitting in the front row of the studio screening theater and the sound reverberated through our bones. I knew then that WALK THE LINE was going to be an exceptional film.n Joaquin's version. While that doesn't detract from the actor's performance, it may cause purists to grumble.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|I love this movie, although I wish they would have made it a little less dirty so more people could enjoy it. I don't mind all the cursing and stuff but I think it prevents some people from enjoying it. My dad was a big fan of the old 'Fireball XL5' kind of \\"british action puppet\\" shows so I really got a kick out of them. Like the South Park animation, it is kind of made to be crappy so its funny. The movie takes some great shots at the Hollywood-Leftys as well as the \\"Kill'em all-America is perfect\\" group. Kim-Jong IL is a pretty easy target. How intimidating can you be with Harry Caray glasses? It is the only thing to come out of the industry that dosen't pander to the left. If your looking for 2 hours of making fun of how the president talks, go watch any other \\"political satire\\" tv or movie. MATT DAMON!
B000BB1MI2|2.0|First, I like Tim Burton as a director, I can't imagine any other director who could even attempt re-making Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The problem is that this version is too dark and creepy for kids and too silly for adults. <br /> <br /> The film has the usual Tim Burton touches: Johnny Depp as the star, Danny Elfman music, very creative art direction and weird characters. However, the musical numbers are terrible, completely uninspired. Also, the entire movie has this dark atmosphere, not really a barrel of laughs. <br /> <br /> I rented this film, avoiding paying $$ to see it at the theatre and I'm glad that I did. If you do buy it, don't pay too much.

B000A6T1JU|1.0|I've been a fan of this film for years and was eagerly anticipating the \\"Director's Cut,\\" only to be dismayed when I realized that all Hill did was add childish, amateurish, comic-book-style transitions for the scenes, making a mockery of his own film! In his taped intro, he admits that some might not like this version of the film. What was your clue, Mr. Hill? The fact that you ruined your own movie? Imagine taking \\"The Godfather\\" and, in between every scene, cutting to a shot of John Cleese saying, \\"And now for something completely different ... \\" and you'll get an idea of how badly Hill junked up what was a solid, gritty, fun, action-packed thriller.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This has not been re-released 4 times. The original \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" was released in April of 2005. This is the only other time it's been re-released.    The 4 additional songs are not all remixes. There is only one, the \\"We Belong Together Remix\\" which is terrific.    The Re-release has 18 great songs + 4 of her music videos. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" her current hit song is included along with the other 3 additional tracks: \\"Makin' It Last All Night,\\" \\"So Lonely,\\" and the \\"We Belong Together Remix\\". Videos: First single \\"It's Like That,\\" #1 Hot 100 hit \\"We Belong Together,\\" #2 Hot 100 hit \\"Shake It Off,\\" and \\"Get Your Number.\\"    If you don't already own the album, this is the item to get. You're really getting the most for your money with this CD/DVD package.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I haven't listened to the remastered Born to Run closely enough yet to pick up the difference in the sound (what can I say- it always already sounded good to me)-  but even if there was NO difference- any Springsteen/E Street Band fan needs this set for the incredible DVD of the 1975 Hammersmith Odeon show!  Here we are only a few years from Bruce's audition for John Hammond, the band just beginning its transition from playing clubs- and you can already see the explosive energy, joy and drama that would make the Springsteen/E Street Band shows some of the most incredible shows in rock'n roll.<br /><br />There are plenty of highlights, but my very favorites are the stripped down \\"Thunder Road\\" with just Bruce on harmonica and Roy Bittan's hypnotic piano, the breathtaking \\"Lost in the Flood\\" about the 1969 Asbury Park race riots, the rollicking \\"Detroit Medley\\", followed by Bruce sitting down to play solo piano on an intimate \\"For You\\", and then ending it all with a boisterous \\"Quarter to Three\\".  Throughout it all, the band is tight as a drum- you can see the look on their faces \\"Hey, world- get a look at US!\\"<br /><br />I haven't yet seen the \\"Wings for Wheels\\" documentary except for the excerpt Amazon had for viewing for the past month or so- and it looks great- but even if it was TERRIBLE and you decided to use it and the BTR disc as COASTERS, the money for this set would be well spent for the incredible Hammersmith disc.  Enjoy!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|While Mimi has been emancipated, all of her lambs have been placed into bondage to keep buying any lame CD she puts out. Mariah Carey went downhill back in 1997 and I haven't supported anything she has done since then. She doesn't appeal to me anymore with her whispy vocals, implants, and attempt to be down with the hip-hop thang. So now in the \\"music\\" world you have this new thing where you re-release the same lackluster album, each time adding a little something on that doesn't contribute anything worthwhile. Simply because it's  Mariah Carey that's reason enough to get this so-called \\"Ultra Platinum\\" CD/DVD edition. What's the next re-release going to be called? Emancipation of Mimi Super Duper Maxi Ultra Platinum Plus? Anyway, this re-relase sucks just as much as the original, probably much more since it's a greedy attempt to rip off folks. But hey, you suckers get what you pay for: nothing.
B00009V7T2|5.0|when the celebrated Texas band At The Drive-In broke up and splintered into two seperate groups, alot of people were bummed...but very excited at the possibilites of what each group's music would be like. everyone knew that both groups would probably be great...but i don't think that anyone could have predicted the sheer brilliance and force of this amazing album. even when i heard the Mars Volta's previous release, the excellent Tremulant ep, it only hinted at the greatness that was to come with this full-length. these songs share a lot in common with ATDI, the driving melodies, the strong guitar lines that are heavy on the fretboard fireworks, and the overall energy that is presented openly within their songwriting; but now there are alot more interesting elements and twists thrown into the mix. the songs are much more developed and there's a generous amount of strange sound affects and loopy psychadelic electronics that submerge the whole album in a thick, dense texture. for some, De-loused In The Comatorium will be too intense, and too busy..maybe too muddled in it's approach and it's ideas...but for those who enjoy a challenging listen, it comes highly highly recommended.
B00018D44U|5.0|Soul/bluegrazz/jazz is how you descirbe Norah Jones. With great songs thoughout the album, its no wonder why she went platinum with this one.

B00005AQE8|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS EVER, ALONG WITH ALL HIS OTHER ONES!!! AND THERE ARE 2 DISCS! AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE TUPAC??!!
B000B8QF14|3.0|<br />There's no denying that the concert featured on the DVD itself is simply great-it's shot well, sound is impeccable, and the crowd seems really into it. If you're a Green Day fan or just a fan of AMERICAN IDIOT there's no chance you won't enjoy the concert. <br /> <br />The annoyances and qualities that make this release less than 5-stars are many, however. As others have stated prior, why did whoever was in charge feel the need to insert interview/documentary footage in between the songs performed at the concert? And why is the audio CD not a complete mirror of the concert, track wise? <br /> <br />The packaging is a bit lacking as well. It's not even a traditional DVD box, which wouldn't be a problem really if they had just tried to push the envelope and be a bit more inventive and original with the official packaging. With a title as daring and \\"in your face\\" as BULLET IN A BIBLE there were so many great directions they could have taken this, maybe making the inside fold-out actually look like a bible or something-anything more creative than the cold plastic tri-fold wrapped in a flimsy plastic cover. <br /> <br />Great concert, great content, annoying editing, \\"meh\\" packaging = 3-stars for an otherwise 5-star worthy band.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to admit, the first time I listened, I was not 100% impressed.  A few catchy tunes, enjoyed the continuous play.  However, after I took a break from the CD and came back to it, I realized it's attraction and artistry.  Now, I cannot stop playing it.  Truly is one of her best.  Sure, some lyrics are \\"dorky\\" but that's part of the uniqueness.  She has come back to her niche (dance) and expresses her fondness of not taking herself so serious and just enjoying life.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This package is a must have for any Springsteen fan.  A great job was done remastering Born To Run.  This one is by far the best sounding of any version.  And my testing has shown that the CD is free of the disgusting Sony copy protection that has been in the news lately.  I was able to rip the CD to iTunes with no problem.  The DVD of concert footage is tremendous.  Well worth the cost of the box.
B00004XPQM|5.0|If Sir Alfred Hitchcock were still around, he probably would have enjoyed this film. In fact, there is a character in this film named, \\"Billy Hitchcock\\" as a homage to Mr. \\"Good Evening\\".<br />  Similar to Hitchcock's films, this movie has so many twists and turns you'll find it hard to stay on the edge of your seat.  Don't spill the popcorn!<br />  A group of college students are about to board Flight 180 to Paris, France.  Alex Chance Browning (Devon Sawa) will be on that airplane.  He is superstitious and has noticed a few suttle things already.  His birthday is on 9-25, the flight leaves at 9:25.  He sits in Seat I (9th letter of the alphabet) in Row 25.  Alex's dreams have been premonitions.  He dreamed the plane exploded.  He wakes ups on the plane before take-off and goes berserk. Alex is thrown off the plane. His teacher (Kristen Cloke) and his classmates (Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott, Chad Donella, Amanda Detmer, Christine Chatelain) go with him into the lobby.  The plane takes off with the other group and suddenly the plane does explode.  The six people are alive because of Alex.<br />  Thirty-Nine days later, during the memorial, some of Alex's friends are scared to death to be around him.  Some are glad to be alive and grateful to Alex.  It was Fate.<br />  Fate is about to happen to Tod (Chad Donella).  Alex had a piece of magazine paper land on his knee.  It read \\"TOD\\".  In fact, Tod just cut himself shaving and unknown leaking water is behind him on the bathroom floor.  Suddenly, Tod slips and a laundry cord strangles him dead.  Fate returns.<br />  Fate is like a spider waiting in her web for a fly.  The fly could not see the web.<br />  Fate is waiting for more of Alex's friends.  They can hide, they can run, should they turn left instead of right?<br />  Fate is going to get them.

B000002G8J|4.0|This is just another example of how Eric Clapton was a victim of expectation.  The poor guy got slammed so many times by reviewers because he didn't record the kind of songs they wanted him to at the time.  But this disc has weathered time very well and it supports what I told my friends back when it was released in '78: this is good stuff.  Not his best, perhaps, but more than worth a listen.  \\"Watch out for Lucy\\" is a catchy pop tune and \\"Roll It\\" is an interesting song that might not sound like EC to many listeners but I still like it.  The highlights for me are \\"If I Don't Be There By Morining\\" and \\"Tulsa Time\\", both excellent funky tunes.  It's interesting to compare these studio versions with the live versions on \\"Just One Night\\" which were recorded a year later in Japan.  I actually prefer the live versions but these studio cuts are also excellent.  By the way, the Cd also includes the full length version of \\"Early in the Morning\\", another excellent tune.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I don't consider myself a sci-fi fan. In fact, I don't really consider Serenity a sci-fi movie. The loveable, lived-in characters and identifiable triumphs and struggles are what make this movie great, not the fact that there are space battles and spaceships (although those are fun too). If you're not into Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, or any of that stuff, you will probably still enjoy this flick. The themes and people will grab you and provide that good old-fashioned thrill missing from so many of today's movies.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Easily in the top ten best albums this year. The sound is amazing and his voice is truly unique. Mighty Rearranger takes you back to the Zeppelin days, and honestly what's so bad about that:) This peace of music is perfect but don't expect any heavy Page-like riffs, although they should put something stronger together than Walking Into Clarksdale. If you need some peace of mind and some serenity of heart than this is THING for you. If there's a reason why you haven't bought this album yet than grab you wallet and run to the nearest record store because it's worth every penny !
B000B8QEZG|3.0|This cd is well produced and does have a throbbing beat throughout.  Unfortunately it is so laced with rehash, cliche madonnaisms and loose references to other artists and other madonna songs that I must say I am a bit disappointed.  There are \\"like a prayer\\" moments, \\"secret\\" moments, \\"ray of light\\" moments, but when she dares to utter the words \\"every step I take, every breath I make\\"--like we all haven't heard that Sting song before, my respect begins to wane.  There's even a moment where she almost seems to borrow partial melodies from Tom Tom Club's Genius of love.  The elements of this album that I like are the disco Giorgio Moroderesque moods.  But, I am afraid that Madonna has written so many children's books that she can't even say the f word in her music anymore.  The cover art is fantastic and she looks hot in her fuschia leotard.  I'd say her \\"Music\\" album is a more innovative departure for her.  Madonna's spiritual psychobabble is simple and clumsily delivered.  This is not an all bad album but I was expecting a real disco comeback and not the same old electronic production values she's been using for the past few albums.  Where's the horns?  Perhaps she's trying to be to deep to what should be shallow fun music.
B0000A118M|5.0|One of the problems about music writing is that some albums get built up so much , that they become cheapened and burdened by all the praise heaped on them - and the praise is REALLY heaped on this album . <br /> <br />After all , a great record is an accident . It is so hard to have all the factors come together at the same time - the songs , the musicians , a good engineer and a producer who will let the recording experience unfold without trying to impose a personal 'sound' on the finished product . <br /> <br />Despite all these things being in place , things can still go wrong . <br /> <br />On this album , it all went right . <br /> <br />The main reason for that is the great empathy , understanding and respect between the musicians .  <br /> <br />To my mind , this album is about a state of mind and its unfolding . If that sounds obscure , it's not meant to be . <br />I can't think of any other way to put it . <br /> <br />Listen to this once in your life , even if you don't like jazz . <br />You may find something missing from other music after you listen to this . Stick with it , as the mood changes throughout . <br /> <br />It is a classic , but it's also a record made by human beings . Do keep that in mind .

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album was long defined as a \\"dance\\" album. I have to disagree to a certain extent.  This release leans more towards the electronica genre than dance, but merges them nicely together.  The other thing I really enjoy is that the songs actually have meaningful lyrics (for the most part) and are not your standard \\"run of the mill brain dead\\" dance lyrics.  This release bears the mark of Madonna's originality and delivers quite well. <br /> <br />For me the highlight(s) of this album was not \\"Hung Up\\", which has caught fire on the Billboard Dance charts, but it was two songs listed on the promo sticker: \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\".  Each of these have a powerful and driving bass line, with extremely catchy melodies.  When I get in my car, I look forward to playing #3 and #7!  I also enjoy \\"Hung Up\\", and funnily enough, \\"I Love New York\\", despite the lyrics are a bit corny and she actually says \\"dork\\" in the song.  <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Madonna fans will find themselves spinning this disc over and over.  It's a mature version of Madonna's dance roots and really delivers.  Are you ready to Jump?

B000BB1MI2|4.0|Director Tim Burton's macabre sense of humor meets writer Roald Dahl's macabre sense of humor in this adaptation of Dahl's novel \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\". I hated the first cinematic incarnation of the novel, 1971's \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\", when I was a child, so I loaded this one into my DVD player with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised to be at least mildly engaged in the story and generally entertained, though I have the same qualms about showing \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" to young children that I did about the 1971 film. The film's sometimes sadistic humor may be genuinely disturbing to children, and the eccentric Willy Wonka is just plain creepy. I actually thought it was a horror film when I was a child.<br /><br />Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is an \\"ordinary little boy\\" who lives with his impoverished but loving family. One day, the reclusive candy magnate Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) announces that he will allow 5 children to tour his huge and mysterious factory, one of whom will win a grand prize \\"beyond your wildest imagination\\". Five Golden Tickets have been placed randomly in Wonka chocolate bars, and children all over the world vie to find them. Poor little Charlie has a wealth of luck and comes up with one of the tickets himself. He chooses his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) to accompany him on the tour, and off they go with four other children and their parents to see how Willy Wonka makes all that delicious candy.<br /><br />Johnny Depp can make creepy, antisocial characters interesting, and he brings a sense of innocence to Willy Wonka that helps. But to tell the truth, Willy Wonka is an unsettling guy who doesn't even like children. Worse, the fates that await the youngsters could easily be the stuff of nightmares -so be careful if you know your child is sensitive. The child actors do a great job of expressing their characters' over-the-top personalities. If the writing has any fault, it is that Charlie is a good boy but a bland character, while his more mischievous companions have stronger personalities and do more to entertain. Annasophia Robb is especially fun to watch as ultra-competitive Violet Beauregarde. \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is obviously intended for children, hence the lessons on the value of family and consequences of disobedience...and the silly song and dance numbers. But the film is peppered with jokes and allusions aimed at adults. It's admirable that \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" strives to entertain its entire audience, but I wonder if the adults won't be just mildly entertained while the kids are just creeped out.a bland character, while his more mischievous companions have stronger personalities and do more to entertain.

B000001XN2|5.0|This recording is a must have for any real lover of singing:  Corelli and  Price together, LIVE, not to mention  Simionato.    Karajan keeps things at a white hot clip, and the velvet of Price with  the trumpeting of Corelli make for the kind of over-the-top opera  experience one lives for.    Given the year and conditions of the recording, the sound is excellent.  I'm one who can tolerate less that state of the art sound for the  excitement of live historic performances.    Price occasionally interpolates unexpected high notes, and then  caps the \\"Mira\\" with a high c that would have best been left at home,  but these are just a few tiny pimples on an otherwise stunning face.  And at these prices, it is a complete steal.  Buy it.
0380820846|1.0|This was a nice little story and mildly amusing but, whatever gave Ms.Dyer, in her editorial review, the idea that this was sensual AT ALL, MUCH LESS give it a 7 rating!  Good grief!  I kept reading, hoping it would get better but I finally gave up at page 300.  I RARELY give up reading a book but I couldn't take the issue of Ms. Whistledown any longer.  I will not be buying any more of this author's books.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The lyrics are there and they're not. (not mind-blowing but to the point )... The sound is driven by the same club thumping that can, in most cases, get all too repetitive... HOWEVER, interweaving between all of the familiarity is a presence of artistry that excites and stimulates an energy from the listener to just move the body (whether your a fan of Madonna's or not)... A subtle, swelling sensuality dresses the typical beats to replace what could have been essentially, a 'monotone' album, with a more 'matured' and pleasing design of music... <br />Not a 'core' fan. But a fan of musical exploration and she is an explorer...Music is for the open-minded. Don't hate on what you don't like. <br />I really enjoyed this album overall but the two stand-outs for me are 'Forbidden Love' and 'Isaac'. Take a listen...
B000BJS4OY|5.0|A classic must-have album, steam-cleaned and revitalized. The original 'wall of sound' concept is left intact but what we have now is the ability to hear everything more clearly. one can hear more of the instrumentation involved, and not in a sterile, isolated, 'digital' way. Each part works together to make the joyous incredible sound that every fan has always heard, but now the work can be done solely by our ears, not our imaginations. This is not to say the original release was flawed, it's just that the same overall sound we had back when it was released has been cleaned up for a new 'listening sensibility' rather than being left as a love letter to the wonderful work of Phil Spector. Times change, and the way we listen to music changes. This is the same album, and it sounds the same - but better. Clean. Not muddy. Not indistinct. It's the best of many worlds.<br /><br />Add to that the amazing, amazing timepiece of the Hammersmith show and a look at an artist, a band, on the brink of worldwide superstardom, and a great documentary that never bores but informs and entertains.<br /><br />This is a no-brainer purchase. If you decide to opt for 'just' the CD that's been around forever (aka the 'Nice Price' disk), you're going to get a great album that sounds like mud - still a great album, but one that will have you adjusting your stereo constantly in an effort to make sound better.<br /><br />Get the box and get so much more.

The result is simply awesome. After this album, Metallica is dead; a ghost of its former glory, never again to reach such high heights or to plumb such deep depths. Highlights for me on this one are Blackened, the title song with its powerful bridge (one of the most memorable moments in music for me), One which is so, so sadly and hauntingly beautiful as to seemingly evoke tears of joy, and To Live Is To Die. BUY IT NOW!!!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|It seems, as I was reading the reviews, that everyone is comparing Mariah against Madonna. It seems that Madonna fans (I am one) believe that Madonna and Mariah hate each other. It could be that they do not talk or that they are too busy to worry about what each other are doing. The fact is, who cares. Can't I like Mariah and Madonna? I bought multiple copies of the original version of TEOM and bought multiple copies of the Ultra platinum edition for me and and people I know who can not afford to buy a cd. Get this...I bought multiple copies of Madonna's new album COADF. Seriously people..Mariah fans are not trying to knock Madonna down! In fact, I will bet that most fan are either gay men or straight women. Gay men, in fact, LOVE Mariah and Madonna..and Cher....and Tina Turner...and celion dion...the list goes on. If you do not care for Mariah, that is ok. She is used to diversity. The fans are used to being called names or what not because they stand up for Mariah. Mariah IS a diva! Madonna IS a diva! Get over it..buy both cd's...and enjoy the music. I am SURE their are MORE great remixes to come for both albums. Mariah and Madonna never disappoint! Enjoy!
B0002S947K|5.0|I'd never even heard of Ray LaMontagne until a few days ago when I saw a brief ad for \\"Trouble\\" on SBS TV here in Australia. <br /> <br />Well, I only needed to hear a few seconds grab of a couple of the songs for me to instantly fall in love.  I knew immediately I was listening to something great. I rushed out the next day and bought a copy and I haven't stopped either listening to it or singing the songs in my head wherever I go. <br /> <br />What a voice! What passion, pain, love, longing and joy he manages to convey in this beautiful, beautiful album of 10 marvellous songs.  I love every song on the album (but special favourites are Hannah, Jolene & Forever My Friend). <br /> <br />I'm going to pass the word amongst family & friends to buy this CD.  As many people as possible deserve to know about and appreciate such a talent as this!
B000B8QF14|5.0|Just as all the Green Day fans that participated in going to one or more of their shows knows, this does lack a good few songs from the full events. It's disappointing, yes, but all together it really is STILL a near-perfect (perfect with those songs back in, but still deserves five stars in my opinion) show to watch in your DVD player. The CD also cuts even MORE from the actual show on DVD, but it's not enough to really notice to an extent unless you're a very close listener. <br />My advice to you is that if you've NEVER seen Green Day in concert, you will NOT be disappointed with this DVD if you've wanted to see them, but haven't gotten the chance. To you that have attended a show or more of theirs on this tour (which includes me), you won't be disappointed either, trust me! I enjoyed it and was able to get into it quite well! True, the documentary points between songs could have been seperated from the actual performance, but all-in-all, it almost seems they were appropriately placed in to make everything go smoothly so you don't have to lose the thrill for the next song to come.
B00004THAY|5.0|'Riding with the King', the much anticipated collaborative album by B.B. King and Eric Clapton, was bashed badly by critics upon its release in 2000. The thing is, that with a pairing like Clapton and King, it's easy to set your expectations too high, and thus it's easy to be disappointed. I'm not sure exactly what these reviewers expected - some epiphany, maybe, some kind of masterpiece that will change music forever. That's not what it is. What 'Riding with the King' is, in truth, is a perfect, repeat, perfect blues album, and one of the best electric blues albums ever recorded. And even if it's not quite as soulful as some of King's early recordings - I said IF, mind you - it's certainly the best he's recorded in decades, and it's clearly the best recording the Slowhand had pulled in many, many years as well. 'Riding with the King' is one of the most exquisite displays of blues guitar I've heard, showing not only virtuoso abilities but also soul and sensitivity from both generations of master axemen, and it's an album that never for a moment ceases to amaze and astound. <br /> <br />The song selection holds very few surprises - there are a couple of blues standards, played by either Clapton or King or both many times over the years; a couple of King classics; and two new songs composed by one of the album's two supporting rhythm guitarists, Doyle Bramhall II. Bramhall's songs, I Wanna Be and Marry You, are both jumpy, funky blues-rock pieces with a strong wah-wah riff; the others are for the most part classic blues tunes, be it the standard Key to the Highway or King's Ten Long Years, and King pours out his soul as he always did into the raw, primal twelve-bar blues. Worthy of special notice are the beautiful Help the Poor, which was recorded by King many years before; as well as the two songs closing the repertoire - Issac Hayes' classic Hold On I'm Coming and the old Ray Charles favorite Come Rain or Come Shine; both these songs draw more from the realms of soul and gospel than from that of blues, and the duo's treatment of them is beyond spectacular. In the aftermath it's the delivery and not the songs that make the album, and nobody delivers like these two. With help from an excellent backup band that includes Bramahll, Andy Fairweather Low, Joe Sample and Steve Gadd, and with a top-notch, flawless production, Riding with the King may not be classic raw blues - but it's the definitive blues experience for the 21st century. <br /> <br />Riding with the King is an essentiality for blues lovers - even if devout classic and acoustic blues lovers may find if overproduced and over-polished - and for fans of either of these spectacular players, and is a treasure for any other music lover too. It's a beautiful, soulful, powerful, sweeping listening experience, with catchy riffs and rhythms and astoundingly beautiful guitar playing, and it's perfect traveling music. A highly recommended experience - buy it now.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I'm sure no Madonna fans will like what I have to say about this, but it is Madonna's weakest album.  I too am a fan, and have ALL the studio albums.  Dance music sits mostly on the surface--beats, production, samples.  A few \\"dance\\" oriented artists go further, and make good pop--Erasure, Depeche Mode in the 80's, and above all, Madonna.  Even on the much-disparaged \\"American Life,\\" Madonna was challenging herself and the genre.  This new CD is entirely regressive.  In harking back to the early days of dance, or what Madonna construes them to be, she is not, as others have said, taking a bold step further.  This is Madonna's most conservative, underwritten album.      That is not to say that it doesn't have its moments.  Despite reusing the title, \\"Forbidden Love\\" is a great, wistful song that uses the vocorder backing vocals to the best effect.  \\"Hung Up\\" is hugely addictive, largely thanks to the Abba sample, but also because Madonna knows how to write a pop song.  The bridge on this song (I can't keep on waiting for you...)  is insanely catchy.  Jump is good, but lacks energy.  As for the rest... again, not Madonna's best.
B000006MS3|5.0|<br /> <br /> I might get the Worst reviewer Ever! amazon prize, but I'm simply at a loss for words... <br /> <br /> It's just perfect! It's like a daydream! <br /> <br /> I dunno what to say, cause words are not enough to describe it.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|\\"McLintock!\\" is a superb film that features John Wayne at his comedic best, and is aided by stellar production values and an excellent supporting cast!<br /><br />And now, the long-awaited release of the \\"official\\" DVD is finally available, and the wait has been worth it! While the features may be minimal compared to other Collector's Edition discs, the film itself is worthwhile, presented in widescreen format with stunning picture and sound!<br /><br />If you're a fan of John Wayne, then this DVD edition of \\"McLintock!\\" is definitely worth it!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A
0767834739|2.0|Is it even possible to make a decent movie out of a video game? As we continue our tour of movies pre-made from video games, we're starting to doubt that. Video games have already revealed everything. Where can the movie go and stay true to the video game (assuming \\"staying true\\" has any meaning in such circumstances). In RS2 we're given every genre gimmick and stereo-type in the book trying to flesh out a story that is already very well-known. Nothing can ever succeed on that basis. Good movies--great movies--are new, strange, and exciting. The writing needs to go in utterly new directions to be meaningful. It's a tremendous risk... and probably one the studios are unwilling to take. But there is a precedent. Shakespeare himself took stories--well-known stories--and wove them in new ways to create the greatest stage-plays ever written. Is this so entirely different from taking concepts from video games and putting them on the screen? Video games provide a shorthand and background that screenwriters could exploit if they chose. Instead, the choose to exploit a too-willing audience.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD SEE THIS <br /> <br />As we've often stated here at Inchoatus, there is a certain charm in going to see some kind of mindless film. Well, this film is utterly mindless. And it has swearing, nudity, blood, and fighting to go with it. If you want to get seriously drunk and go see some women kick ass, then you've probably found a movie. Go rent it and just make sure you're pretty damned drunk when you go see it. There is no reason--none at all--to see it sober. The film is void of any artistic merit whatsoever.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID <br /> <br />The goal of Inchoatus is to elevate the genre. We're founded precisely to encourage people to avoid films precisely like this. There are actually some decent films out there that feature blood, nudity, and fighting. Conan the Barbarian is an excellent example. The Event Horizon is another. Even Underworld had some merit to it. The anim film Ghost in a Shell is a tremendous film. As the core audience for all things speculative fiction, we don't have to automatically succumb to this kind of stuff just because they market it. If we can just muster the strength to show a little resistance to this kind of schlock, producers will be forced to provide something better. Is there a better reason to avoid seeing this film? We think not.  <br /> <br />Obviously, anyone who isn't well and truly immersed in zombie movies or horror flicks--or has a very serious thing for Milla Jovavich--should avoid this film.  <br /> <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
B000B8QEZG|3.0|This will make die-hard fans happy but those who have yet to be hooked by Madonna will not be converted by this one. I find it okay.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie so it isn't all too closely related to the book which i also love the movie is highly enjoyable and has fantastic special effects and awsome bloody and gory action. It is a movie i just can't get enough of. As far as science fiction movies go this is the best of the best everything you want. So if you like sci-fi movies starship troopers is a must own!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who said that \\"American Idiot\\" is one of the worst songs on this album and may even go one step further to say it is THE worst on the album--and it still isn't a terrible song. <br /> <br />This is my first encounter with Green Day and I love it.  The songs are all so energetic; some are downright angry.  But they all have wonderful melodies and thought-provoking lyrics.  The songs blend together seamlessly but have enough differences to set each apart as its own entity.
B00005JO1P|4.0|4/ 5 <br /> <br />136 minutes <br />released November 18, 2005 <br /> <br />Walk The Line is an excellent film and is elevated above being a typical biopic by the stellar cast and the performances by the two lead actors. I wouldn't be surprised if Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix receive Oscar nominations,not to mention a Best Picture nod for the film itself. Director James Mangold received acclaim for Cop Land (1997) and Girl, Interrupted (1999, in which Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for best supporting actress.) <br /> <br />Phoenix's portrayal is understated and subtle as opposed to being over the top and flashy. It seemed realistic and heartfelt as he struggled through bittersweet moments. You see the tough upbringing he had with a drunken, cold and seemingly loveless father (Robert Patrick (1958), X-File's John Doggett and Terminator Two's T-1000). The friendship with his older brother ended due to tragedy and his father placed some of the blame on Johnny, who was fishing at the time. He felt guilty about this his whole life. Over sixty years later, Cash talked about how he looked forward to meeting his brother again in Heaven. His first marriage turned cold as his wife took little interest in his life on the road. At the same time, you he pinned for the lovely and divorced June Carter (1929), who constantly rebuffed him as he took to a life of popping pills, further digging himself into a pit of despair. Or a ring of fire. He used to listen to radio broadcasts of the Carter Family, which included a young June, in the 1940s. <br /> <br />It's interesting to note that all the Johnny Cash and June Carter vocals were sung by Phoenix and Witherspoon. And they did play my favorite Cash tune, the crackling \\"Jackson\\", which won them a Grammy in 1967, in the Best Country & Western Performance, Duet, Trio Or Group (vocal or instrumental) category. <br /> <br />One of my favorite scenes in the film was the audition for Sam Phillips (1923), owner of Sun Records, the seminal early roots and rock'n'roll label that helped launch Elvis, and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others. He gave honest feedback regarding the gospel song that Cash's band performed to try and get a deal. He asked Cash that if he was in a car wreck and had time to sing just one more song before he died, what would he sing? Cash to performed one of his non-gospel, from the heart songs, written while he was in the military, and this was the very first Johnny Cash recording, \\"Hey Porter.\\" <br /> <br />Until now, I have always thought of Reese Witherspoon as a credible but limited actress, a flyweight. This is arguably her best role and is a terrific performance. She's razor sharp and when she's on stage with Phoenix, she's totally convincing as a performer. <br /> <br />If you ever wondered how Johnny Cash ended up recording Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison (1968), you get the explanation and see the resistance. For years, he received a ton of fan mail from inmates and incareated men, people who could relate to the songs about lawbreaking and the outlaw life. <br /> <br />I couldn't help but feel sorry for Cash, due to certain scenes, especially ones involving his father. During one Thanksgiving at Cash's beautiful new house and waterfront acreage, his dad couldn't say a kind word but instead levelled criticism at his famous son, who, in 1969, was arguably the hottest act in the world, outselling even the Beatles. Meanwhile, it was apparent that Johnny Cash so desperately wanted his father's unconditional love, something that was long overdue. <br /> <br />You do get to see Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings and the Killer, Jerry Lee Lewis, but they in no way overshadow Cash in this story. You also get to see how Cash and June Carter had a chance to develop and solidify their friendship and love. They toured together with a few other artists, and later, together. <br /> <br />True, this film is not unlike last year's Ray: poor boy grows up to eventually become hot young star, takes pills, does some womanizing, ends up in the slammer, eventually comes clean and lives out the rest of his life trouble-free. <br /> <br />If you see this film, there's bound to be emotions that you can really relate to. Johnny Cash was a performer people truly identified with. He's hard his share of hard knocks, disappointments. His attempts to come to terms with his outlaw lifestyle in light of his strong spiritual beliefs, was what he sang about.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|This album is pure trash. Madonna is a sell out, plain and simple. Her last album talking bad about policts flopped, so now she is just working with hot producers and making dance music because it is popular, she just wants money. She is a sell out. She can hardly even sing, and she is unoriginal. Most of these dongs aren't even danceable, Madonna you are almost 50, quit acting young and making this crap, it is not even good or enjoyably, SELL OUT!!
B00006M183|5.0|First of all, Nero (see below) wouldn't know good music if it slapped him in the face.  \\"Riot Act,\\" while it certainly doesn't represent the band's best work, does contain some of their best songs to date (\\"Save You,\\" \\"Thumbing My Way,\\" \\"You Are,\\" and \\"I Am Mine\\") that showcase their loyalty to their roots of hard rock and grunge as well as ballads but also their ambition to experiment with satisfying results.   <br /> <br />But I've always said that you can't appreciate Pearl Jam unless you hear or see them live because even some of the seemingly worst tracks on their albums sound great in concert.  \\"Binaural\\" is a perfect example of this.  There's nothing wrong with any of the songs on this album, only the recording quality.  Pick up any of the 2000 concert bootlegs and you'll see that the songs from \\"Binaural\\" provide some of the most crowd pleasing and rockingest moments.  I don't know why the sound quality is so bad but I love hearing these songs live.  With \\"Riot Act\\" better sound quality is back and we see them in a creative stage not seen since either \\"Vitalogy\\" or \\"No Code.\\"   <br /> <br />People who criticize Pearl Jam for being a failure as a band simply do not understand WHO they really are or what it truly means to be a Pearl Jam fan.  Pearl Jam does not care about ratings or in making music that they think their fans want to hear.  Any PJ fan who has done their research knows this.  They know who they are as a band and they write the music that they want to write and tell their fans to love it or leave it.  People who criticize PJ do so from the flawed perspective that making music is all about giving your fans what they want.  If you want that go listen to Britney Spears or Limp Bizkit.  Pearl Jam has transcended this.  They are who they are and plenty of people love them for it.  I just got to see them live in Philadelphia as part of their 2005 North American tour and they were phenomenal.  Still able to sell out a large arena while not even promoting a new album.  They have definitely not lost their edge or their fan base.  They also seem ready to slam the industry with a long-awaited album next Spring that promises to really rock.   <br /> <br />I wish people would stop comparing them to grunge. THEY'RE NOT A GRUNGE BAND! And I'm sure that they would take issue with being labeled as such, even back in 1992.  They're Pearl Jam.  If you really want to hear their influences, listen to Neil Young, Bob Dylan, or the  Who.   <br /> <br />Again, in response to Nero, \\"No Code\\" is one of Pearl Jam's best albums.  Every one of the songs on that album is great. But comments like Nero's are probably what the band would expect from someone who is not a true fan and doesn't really understand their music.  \\"No Code\\" was PJ giving their middle finger to the industry and saying, \\"we'll write whatever the heck we want to write,\\" and the result was songs like \\"Red Mosquito,\\" \\"Smile,\\" \\"Present Tense,\\" and \\"Around the Bend,\\" which really show the band progressing as a creative unit.  Mike McCready even said in an interview that he thought that \\"Who You Are\\" was the best song the band had ever written.   <br /> <br />So \\"Riot Act\\" is a great album and every true fan understands this.  It contains timeless classics destined to become permanent additions to the Pearl Jam catalog.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|i'm a madonna fan and really enjoyed her last album. there's nothing on this one to compare to \\"love profusion\\" off of american life. it's all shallow disco with a 16/16 beat. the music is uninspired, dull, and repetitive. at least the producers decided to lose the annoying pitch-shifter they have been using on vocals since cher's album \\"believe\\". it's time to hang your pumps and ho outfit up, madonna, cause you jumped the shark with this album for me
B000000OF6|4.0|I would say this would sum up all the greatest of Queen except one song \\"These are the days of our lives.\\" How could you forget about that great beautiful balled? That would be the only complaint.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is a real dance treat, I've listened to it non stop in my car for the past 3 weeks.   I like the whole album but My favorites are:  Hung Up     Get Together    I love New York (which for some reason a lot of people don't like but I think it's a great dance anthem)    Jump (probably my favorite)    Push    Isaac    What I do have to say is that the album  really reminds me of Kylie Minogue's last albums and I don't think it's a coincidence  But Madonna is still the queen and all the other pop tarts can f off (except kylie).  Have Fun
6300214435|2.0|If you want to believe, don't bother reading this.  <br />After much anticipation, I just finished viewing Temple of Doom and found it a dissapointment. Indy's 2-dimensional companions \\"Willie\\" and \\"Shorty\\" seemed to toggle between desparate comic diversion and self-serving audience identification. The main villian spouted exotic gibberish to some styrofoam god gave the term \\"heart wrenching\\" a new definition. The insects were slimy also. I'm sorry- it may be my 12\\" TV or maybe I am in a cranky mood, but I found this movie to be a skeleton from the 80s best locked away.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Very realistic caper; everything is highly probable and believable, and it's very likely real thieves are studying it carefully for professional tips, just like they did \\"Rififi\\". There's a few things I didn't quite understand --- like why didn't Spiderman get any billing, and why was his costume so loose-fitting and badly made?  I'm sure his role was significant, but you'll have to look hard, or you might just miss it. Luckily we've got dvd replay facilities these days: check out The Moment of Truth. And what's this place called OHLLYWODO? And then, obviously, what about that golfer? A guy with that handicap I'd like on my team.    WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT SPIDERMAN IS DOING IN THIS MOVIE?    Well, come on people! Hasn't anyone else noticed Spiderman yet? He's there, in the street, for about three frames. Stop the action at the Moment of Truth. This is a great opportunity to make constructive use of that \\"Comment\\" box --- so far the only comments on my reviews that I've seen are completely stupid.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Admit it guys, if DCFC would have stayed on Barsuk, you would all be hailing this as their finest album to date!  Sure, you can bitch about the fact that the production is a bit too slick and the songs are a bit too poppy, even for them...  But when it comes down to it, most of you are just mad because the band we've loved for so long is now mainstream, and not indie.  IMO that's just selfish.  We shouldn't be mad just because other people less open to indie are now enjoying the DC that we've always loved.      There's also the fact that now Gibbard has a big expensive Atlantic records studio to work his magic in, we should expect some even more positive things coming from him in the future.  Yeah, I will admit some of these songs sound a bit too polished and cut-and-dry, but it's not really that big a deal.  The tracklist is varied enough for most, and the intsrumental arrangements are what we have come to expect from the standard DCFC lineup.  I have heard a lot of complaints from people saying the keyboards are not as prominent on here as in previous releases.  I completely dissagree.  There may not be a clear cut piano on every track, but the ones that feature it are phenomenal.  The organ on \\"Marching Bands of manhattan\\" is one of the best piano uses ever in a DC record.  \\"Brothers on a hotel bed\\" is another outstanding keyboard track.  The melody is so soothing you will not believe your ears.      All in all, this is more like Transatlanticism than the older releases.  That's either a good or bad thing depending on what kind of fan you are.  \\"Plans\\" simply perfects what DCFC started with \\"The photo album\\".  Whether or not you think they perfected it too much is your oppinion.  Personally I'm a bit split in two.  I both love and hate the new production.  It's a lot cleaner but it sounds almost restrained.  Of course, what DC album isn't?    Lyrically, this just might outdo \\"transatlanticism\\".  \\"Plans\\" is much more philosophical than anything DCFC have ever putout.  Of course the love/life thing is still present, but approached a little bit differently.  Most of the songs will give you a combo feeling of sadness and comfort at the same time.      Whats really impressive though, is how DCFC made the transition to a major label without screwing their fans over.  If you'll all recall, Nirvana/modest mouse/ect...  Had rough transistions from indie to big time status.  DCFC does is with smooth style.  There's not one filler song on here, and that's saying something.  It would have been easy for Gibbard to write \\"Soul meets Body\\" and release this with a bunch of other crap tracks, then ride on the success like a russian race horse.  But no, he is loyal to his fans and compiles a tremendously enjoyable pop album that is still indie at heart.    Overall, the questionable production is not near enough to take this below a five star.  The songs are just too good.   Buy this now.
B000069HJN|5.0|Brother where you bound is second favourite album from Supertramp after Breakfast in America.This album is a classic right from the first to the last track and is hugely recommended to all fans of good classic rock music.
B00004VWAF|5.0|This is my favorite Miles album. That doesn't mean it will be yours. Some people still don't appreciate any of his electric stuff. I always liked In a Silent Way but this was harder to get into. Once the late sixties hit every jazz musician was trying to regain the rock audience with dated organ freakouts or Beatles covers but Miles was one of the few who GOT IT RIGHT. From Silent Way to B. Brew to Live-Evil, then suddenly the people who got all these albums were blown away by On the Corner. No one can call this selling out because its just so out there nothing else can touch it. On the one hand it covers the urban street life vibe yet at the same time it is a psychadelic jam, perhaps a little more focused then what followed it (Dark Magus, Pangaea).  As for its influence, great artists such as Squarepusher can rightly claim it whereas many of today's half baked jam bands should leave it alone. Anyway, buy it, listen to it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah's career has been a freefall since day one. This album is nothing as good as earlier MC's hits. The first albums (particullary Musicbox) are what Mimi should have done always.

B000B8QEZG|1.0|This cd is well produced and does have a throbbing beat throughout. Unfortunately it is so laced with rehash, cliche madonnaisms and loose references to other artists and other madonna songs that I must say I am a bit disappointed. There are \\"like a prayer\\" moments, \\"secret\\" moments, \\"ray of light\\" moments, but when she dares to utter the words \\"every step I take, every breath I make\\"--like we all haven't heard that Sting song before, my respect begins to wane.

It's no wonder that the American reviewers find no fault with this film because only 1-2% of them have passports but for anyone who understands what the word geography means you will be too sidetracked by the juvenile stereotypes to really enjoy this film.  <br /> <br />Most of the time you will be thinking to yourself:- \\"how pathetic\\".  <br />
B00005MNP8|5.0|This was the second album i bought by Blondie.when i first heared it i was listening to the best music in the world! <br />and of course it is my favorite album! <br />who doesn't like One Way or Another or Hanging on the Telephone? <br />11/59 is also a great song so is Picture This and I Know But I Don't Know. <br />i love all the songs on this album!
B0009S4IHY|1.0|Well let me start off by saying that I like a lot of these movies. This one was just well..... dumb. It was really dumb. I like dumb kung fu movies but this one crossed the line. It might've been better if the entire movie you didn't have to read the bottom of the screen or be fluent in Japanese to undertand what they were saying. The movie it self is not good. Very boring and the fight scenes are overrated. There is one good scene where these people with nine inch nails kill off some kung fu masters, but that is it. The rest is gay as Fing he11! Don't by this DVD. If you really want to see it rent it so you don't waste your money. Try Kung Pow Enter the Fist, it's better and the characters talk in English!!!!!
B000BHHVPO|5.0|My husband and I were at the London concert. It was amazing. I could not believe when I won the tickets to attend. Me, some crazy American, participating in history. I am anxious to see if we made it into the footage, as I gleefully waved to every camera I saw. I'm just glad no one filmed me falling down a flight of stairs at the subway station(hee-hee).
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's new album is something special.  The songs are so exuberant and powerful and fun and magnetic that only a robot could resist them.  Give yourself over to the frenetic vibe and just have fun!  Enjoy it for what it is and if you've spent the last several years bad-mouthing Madonna and everything she does, it's OK to rescind your negativity.  We die-hard fans will forgive you and welcome you back into the fold of Madonna fans. <br /> <br />I love the message on \\"Like It or Not.\\"  Like Madonna or not, you'll be boogeying your butt off to this music for years to come if you just give it a chance.  Take that, you haters!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I listened to samples of this album before buying it to find that I knew I HAD to have this album, and sure enough, I was right again!   Pat Metheny's distinct sound and style has quickly turned me into a HUGE Metheny fan in just a matter of months.   I don't understand why people are like, \\"that album sucks\\" but I KNOW this album is amazing, even though it has four very elongated tracks.   But to understand this properly, this album is structured like a suite, with four movements.   Although these movements are very long, why I enjoy this album so much is because of its different musical phases this album goes through.   Part one on this CD introduces the main theme melody of the album.   You will hear it several more times again in the other movements.    Although this is a very new album, it's not fair to just assume that Metheny's family is interfering with his career.   Artists have a natural tendency to change their style over a period of time.    This album is extremely different from \\"Bright Size Life,\\" \\"Speaking of Now,\\" or even \\"Still Life.\\"   So if you're not a PMG fan, at least give this album a listen.   Otherwise, you'll listen to it, become addicted to it, and find yourself listening to it at least 3 times a day.   I know I am.
B0007GAERG|5.0|One critic from Vibe magazine wrote that \\"Mariah gets back to her winning formula with Mimi.\\" This almost seems like an understatement; the CD is really that good! Do yourself a major favor and get this-enjoy it today!
0312263120|2.0|This book is almost completely factually inaccurate. The math is wrong, the technology is made up, and the author confuses a lot of his terms. It's obvious that some -- perhaps even enough -- research was performed, and it's also obvious that the author understood none of it. Don't. Read. This. Book.
B000AARKOO|1.0|Crusaders - a downhill of civilization <br /> <br />For History accurancey please bear this with me: <br /> <br />The Crusaders (1096-1270 a/c.) <br /> <br />1st. Crusader (1096-1099)Begun from central Europe through Constandinoupolis on route to Jerusalem <br /> <br />2nd Crusader (1147-1149) Begun from London & Paris -2- armies one through Constandinoupolis and another via sea through the Mediterrenean sea on route to Jerusalem <br /> <br />3rd Crusader (1189-1192) Begun from central Europe through Dardanelia (Keratios gulf) into Asia never reached Jesusalem totally destoyed near Attalyia, Northern Turkey <br /> <br />4th Crusader (1202-1204) Begun from Venice, Italy via sea never before mentioned, but this one was mainly an open attack to Constandinoupolis (Byzantine's capital of the Eastern Empire) and ended with the destruction of a Major Christian capital city. <br /> <br />5th Crusader (1217-1221) Begun from Hungary via sea through Cyprus and to Acra (Ptolemais the city of)on route to Holy Land (never reached Jerusalem) <br /> <br />6th Crusader (1228-1229) Begun from Northern Italy via sea through Crete, Greece & Cyprus on route to Holy Lands (never reached Jerusalem) <br /> <br />7th Crusader (1248-1254) Begun from Northern France via sea through Cyprus then Egypt and to Acra (Ptolemais the city of) <br /> <br />8th Crusader (1270) never actually begun, but was sold out by the Venice Doge to Egypts Muslim King. This was actually the end of all cristian Latin/Catholic dogma endeavor's to protect the  faith represented by Constandinoupolis Orthodox dogma(Byzantine's capital and provinces of the Eastern Empire) from the incoming Selzouk Turks invasion, and final Islam forces overpowered the Eastern Empires capital Constandinoupolis (Instanbul, Turkey) and gain their first foothold in Europe. <br /> <br />Being of a Greek origin this movie \\"Kingdom of Heavens\\" and Ridley Scott as its Director reminds me of another movie \\"Aliens\\" that introduced a new lifeform totally alien to the man yet one that breeds within a human host and kills him when it's coming to life.  In a similar way the \\"Christian\\" Crusaders brought into life the Islamic faith along with its destructive behaviors both in culture and religious matters. <br /> <br />My prayer today is that people of this epic film will take history as their only guide, and not their pleasure and entertainment.  <br /> <br />
B0001I55OC|1.0|In TIME FLIES, an obscure musical-fantasy produced in 1944, British funsters Tommy Handley and Evelyn Dall hop into a time machine and travel back to the Elizabethan era. Thanks to their knowledge of history and the arts, Evelyn helps William Shakespeare finish writing Romeo and Juliet by feeding him his own dialogue, while Tommy gives Sir Walter Raleigh lessons in chivalry. TIME FLIES is a largely forgettable romp, but the point is that even this modest picture contains a couple of pretty clever ideas. <br />     <br />Now, some 60 years and a few million dollars later, comes TIMELINE, a grating time travel tale filled with lots of CGI effects and nary one fresh idea. Although the main characters are whisked off to 14th-century, the filmmakers don't go back any further than BRAVEHEART and the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy as a source for their borrowed concepts, characters, and imagery. (It also steals from the 1960s TV series TIME TUNNEL.) <br />     <br />The plot-or what passes for one-deals with the efforts of an archeologist's son (Paul Walker) to rescue his father (Billy Connolly), who's trapped in 14th-century France thanks to some sort of time travel snafu. Naturally, sonny boy and an intrepid gang of scientists teleport themselves back in time to snatch dear ol' dad from the jaws of certain death. (Though it's a little-known historical fact, 14th-century France was overrun with American actors sporting heavy makeup and phony accents.)   <br />     <br />This is one of those empty, slick-but-still-cheesy-looking adventures that should have skipped theatrical distribution and gone straight to UHF-television syndication instead; all that's missing are the Cellular One and KFC commercials. I suppose if you've NEVER seen a movie, you might get some entertainment value out of TIMELINE. Then again, if you've never seen a movie, TIMELINE is a pretty lousy place to start. <br />
0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond does a spectacular job examining the causes of societal collapses from the past and examining how in the modern world we are still at risk. Of the five factors listed in the book, Diamond notes that the most significant is the choices that societies make in response to environmental degredation and destruction. With overpopulation, overconsumption, and environmental problems being a big issue today, Its nice to have a book that looks at the comprehensive fates of societies before us who were presented with the same issues. Diamond further supports his findings by listing what scientific evidence he bases his reasoning on. Worth every penny.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Back in the 1940s, Universal Pictures combined their classic horror creations for all-star monster rallies like HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, HOUSE OF DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN, and ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. The decision-makers at Universal decided to update this formula in VAN HELSING, which turns the legendary vampire hunter into a buff James Bond/Indiana Jones figure and pits him against Dracula and his brides, the Wolf Man, the Frankenstein Monster, and even Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. All this brings a new dimension to the term overkill.  <br /> <br />Writer-director Stephen Sommers is responsible for THE MUMMY (1999) and THE MUMMY RETURNS (2001); both films, particularly the latter, sacrificed any trace of characterization and plot development for the sake of gaudy special effects. VAN HELSING ups the ante considerably with a nonstop parade of migraine-inducing visuals and a chalk-scraping-on-blackboard soundtrack. This is certainly the noisiest monster movie ever made, if not the noisiest film ever made, with enough action scenes for a dozen films. It's like sitting through one l-o-n-g theatrical trailer. <br /> <br />The early sequences provide the best moments; the opening scene set in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory (presented in black & white) effectively establishes the film as a revisionist take on the classic monster themes. A little while later, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) arrives in Transylvania just as Count Dracula's three vampire brides attack the village; it's a thrilling, exciting, and beautifully paced set-piece. It doesn't take long, however, for exhaustion to set in. The film, like its title character, takes no prisoners, as one shrill action scene is piled upon another at a furious rate: Windows are smashed, walls crumble, bridges collapse, carriages explode, gunshots reverberate, lab equipment crackles, blood splatters, everyone swings from an assortment of conveniently placed ropes and cords, and all victims die screaming. (Imagine being locked in a room with a group of hyperactive children and you'll get some idea of what to expect.) <br />     <br />The real shame is that lurking somewhere in the midst of all the yelling and carnage is the makings of a reasonably entertaining horror picture. Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale (as a female vampire hunter), and Richard Roxburgh (Count Dracula) are good leads, although there's precious few opportunities for them to really act. The standard monster clichs are cleverly incorporated into the story line, but without any quieter moments, the film lacks the sense of dread that's integral to any successful horror tale. Most of the fun comes from anticipating a shock scene, allowing your imagination to run wild; unfortunately, VAN HELSING offers nothing but shock scenes, utilizing slick computerized images to spell everything out for you.  <br /> <br />A younger generation of film fans now find the Universal monster movies from the '30s and '40s too slow and tame to sit through. If that's the case, VAN HELSING may be perfect entertainment for them. As for me, I'll take slow and tame any day. At least my hearing won't be impaired. <br />
0553801503|1.0|Never wrote a book review before but this one is so disappointing I felt like to yell...this sucks&#65281; <br /> <br />Preordered the book but still only half way through - I am afraid it's too much a bore for me to finish. Boring repeated sentences and references, uninteresting new or secondary characters, even the old interesting characters such as Jamie and Cersei become dull and stupid. That baby crying Gilly crying Sam sea sick boring voyage just makes me want to throw them all into the ocean. <br /> <br />No matter how epic a book the author is aiming for, one thing is essential to a book being good - the story need to have characters that the readers care about and the story has to develop. Where are the characters? The Imp, the Dragon Queen, Jon Snow... they seem all gone. The a few who stayed, little finger, Sansa, Arya...heck, they sort of just stayed here doing nothing - not much a story. <br /> <br />This \\"editor cuts it into half a book\\" is a bad execuse. Adding another a few hundred similar pages won't change the fact that the story is falling apart and losing its focus. Next one, I will read reveiw before deciding to buy or not. <br /> <br />What a shame and waste! I like the first three SO MUCH.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|Contrary to my long-held belief, I guess it does take more than pouring Halle Berry into a skintight outfit to hold my interest. Case in point: CATWOMAN, an oddly uninvolving action film that's short on action and long on flashy MTV-like visuals. It's your standard mousy-hero-becomes-vigilante comic book tale, although the stunning Miss Berry is never convincing as a wallflower. That's one of the basic problems: Because Halle is never believable as her character, we never become involved with her adventures. The lackluster screenplay doesn't help either; this is a straight-to-video endeavor masquerading as a major theatrical release. (Did someone fish this script out of Shannon Tweed's garbage dumpster?) Even the Catwoman costume seems like a slapped-together afterthought; wearing it, Berry looks like she's all set to star in the inevitable XXX-rated porno parody of the film. Benjamin Bratt hangs around to supply the obligatory hunky love interest, while Sharon Stone turns up as the equally perfunctory rich bitch villainess. CATWOMAN would be lame at any time, but in the wake of the exhilarating SPIDERMAN 2, its flaws are as conspicuous as Berry's cleavage.
0596007124|5.0|Most computer books generally skip or just brush by explanations of why a certain set of coding practices are important. Better than any book I've seen in computing, this book tackles a complex topic and drives home the importance of why a given pattern is important. Rather than \\"do this because we know it's good for you\\", this book drags the reader through an information maze, constantly nuding the reader's involvement with a series of zany and not-so-zany exercises. The humor is both campy (with the Andy Hardy era photos) and hip. However, it's not superflous or off point. Everything in this book has been woven together into a fine collection of explanations, exercises and examples, the likes of which I've never seen.<br /><br />The care given to how everything ties together is remarkable, and while some may snort that the book is too cartoony, I found it to be otherwise. (It's like saying that the New Yorker is too cartoony.)<br /><br />Most important is that this book worked for me. I didn't breeze by it on a single read, but rather I went over it again and again, finding new nugets with each read. Granted, I often didn't do all of the little exercises, and I'm poorer for it. Also, I sometimes skipped the DP Guru exchanges with \\"grasshopper\\" (if you've never seen re-runs of Kung-Fu with David Caradine, you may miss the reference), but I still was able to create design patterns -- and in ActionScript 2.0 and ActionScript 3.0; not Java, the language for which the book was written.<br /><br />So if you want to lean Design Patterns and learn how and when to use them, this book is solid gold.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I have no concrete fact to tell as to what in the hell C.P. or screenwriter J.U. had set in mind when they 'made' this film...all I know is it appears to promote anarchy and terrorism, and it takes a lot of guts or a strong lack of sensitivity to watch this film repeatedly...it's got a strong plot, strong ideas, and the truth of this film is undeniable, unless you wish to lie to yourself or others: men are violent and should accept it.  Me, I'm raised in a feminist society and was totally oblivious to the ideas in this film until I saw it the 2nd or 3rd time...I was actually taken AGAINST the film simply b/c of the 'commentary' that the author and the other people in the project had to offer...it seems like 10 people have at least a modiifed idea from the other 9 as to what this film actually is supposed to be...which is why I give it four stars instead of 5.  If I knew why this film seems like another terrorist-threat, I might be able to like it better and review it more 'accurately'.  Until then, all I can tell you is that the only sure-thing about this film is it IS, however the heck this happened, undeniably, a MASTERPIECE!!!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I loved the original version released in April, but this new set is amazing.  The four new songs are awesome.  Don't Forget About Us is amazing and sounds like a continuation of We Belong Together. Making It Last All Night is one of those songs you turn up the bass and bump to it.  So Lonely is an amazing uptempo song with twista, it's one of the hottest songs.  The We Belong Together remix is amazing and I'm sure you heard it.  The DVD includes all the videos and is nice to see them all.  Don't read the bad reviews left by Madonna fans (haters), I'm sure none of them listened to the album.
B0000025ZK|5.0|I was a late comer to Pink Floyd, in that I never bought an Cassette or CD until the late 80s. But the first I bought was Gilmours' first solo album. And I discovered that I liked the music better when he stood apart from the rest of the group. As a matter of fact all of the members solo efforts were better than the group, artistically. I like all Floyd, well not Relics, which I considered lame, and Obscured by Clouds. But About Face was David exploring the possibilties of a career after Floyd, and I liked the CD. It was a prelude to the next two albums by the re-formed Floyd, sans Waters. I felt Waters was holding back the other members....after all, David showed what he had on Comfortably Numb, and also was impressive on Run Like Hell.<br /><br />I look forward to his rumoured next album...  Hopefully Mr. Waters can put aside his differences, as well as David, and bring out a album that will stand the test of time that Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall have.
0553801503|4.0|If you've read the three previous books in the \\"Song\\" series, you understand just how amazing this universe that Martin has crafted is. That's really the strength of the series - from Dorne to the Iron Islands, from Casterly Rock to The Wall, from Braavos to Harrenhal, Martin's world is teeming with life and realism. <br /> <br />When it's all said and done, and this Song has been fully sung, people will look at \\"Feast\\" as the bridge between the first three and the last three. It is radically different from the first three, but really, how much more warfare and carnage could there be? This book is the theoretical \\"calm before the storm\\", with lots of set-up. <br /> <br />Something this book does that is truly magnificent is introduce you to new POV's and new places. While Dorne and the Iron Islands have been mentioned and profiled to some degree (Dorne with Oberyn Martell and the Iron Islands with Theon Turncloak, er Greatjoy), they get a good amount of space in \\"Feast\\". The plotlines here are just awesome, especially on the Iron Islands, and I particularly enjoyed Aeron Damphair's POV's. The Dorne chapters are excellent as well, moving slowly at first but culminating with a staggering revelation in the very last line of the last Dorne chapter. <br /> <br />I've read almost EVERY review of Feast on this site, and I haven't seen ANY mention of the amazing plot twist in the last chapter of the book. There is one line uttered in that chapter that will turn Westeros as we know it upside down. Just tremendous stuff. <br /> <br />Read the prolouge and then read the last chapter. Who is Pate at the very end? I'd suspect Varys (I'd also suspect that Varys is the Alchemist), but that's just me. <br /> <br />Cersei's chapters are a character study of a person drifting into insanity, and it's hilarious to see her do things that are clearly absurd, but since it's thru her POV, Martin writes about them as wondrous. Jaime's development into a real human being continues, and I'd say that the only downside are Brienne's chapters, as I just don't find her to be interesting enough a character. <br /> <br />Another plot twist - who is the champion that Qyburn speaks of to Cersei towards the end of the book? Is it the Mountain, re-incarnated? Oooh. Just chilling stuff. <br /> <br />I'd give it 5 stars, but Brienne's chapters are a bit slow for me. Again, this is just set-up for the final three books, but... it's still Martin. You can't go wrong with GRRM. If you've read the previous three, get this NOW. If you haven't read any of these books, do yourselves a favor and pick up Game of Thrones.
B000003489|5.0|I think this is Coltrane's best all around album. Every song on here is good and could be on a greatest hits album. Cousin Mary, Niama, countdown, and Syeeda's song flute are great. This could be second only to Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. The remastered version has 15 songs which includes 8 alternate takes. The classic quartet is not together yet when this album came out but some of the musicians were on different songs. My opinion coltrane is on the two best jazz albums of all time Kind of Blue and this Giant Steps.
B000002UJQ|5.0|My first radiohead album, and I can't put it down (well I put it down after a while, everyone gets bored of albums after many listens). Wonderful mix of slow and fast(er) rhythms.. very original melodies and lyrics, wish I would have picked this up sooner!
B000000Y2F|5.0|In 1957 Thelonious Monk was working at the five spot club in Harlem and John Coltrane just came out of Miles Davis'quintet to start his solo career. But right before that he spent nine months with Thelonious Monk and his band. They played at the five spot club a lot too. On this album the best songs are Ruby my Dear and Trinkle Tinkle but that doesn't mean the whole album isn't good don't get that mistaken.
B000AY74OG|5.0|Okay, I admit I am 28 years old and have no kids. That said, I checked this out on rental. I was impressed. The movie is very funny and of course clean. I was laughing my head off within a few minutes. The characters are strong, and they really allow you to get into the movie. I would highly reccomend this for anyone, even if you have no kids. I will be getting this DVD for my nieces and nephew. Madagascar is a family fun film that will please everyone.
B00004TA41|5.0|This album was recorded in 1967 the same year of his death but wasn't realeased until 1974. On this album Coltrane did a duet with drummer Rashied Ali who was in his band at the time. The original tracks are jupiter,saturn,mars,and venus plus two bonus tracks jupiter variation, and Leo.
0060090367|5.0|I adore Marian Keyes. I read her column in Marie Claire every month - if you must know, it's the first page I skip to. Ahem. <br /> <br />\\"Watermelon\\" is just fabulous as are all her books. I cry with laughter at them. I love that she writes in the 1st person and Claire; the narrator, newly dumped, left holding the baby is so wonderfully warm and ironic. <br /> <br />Claire's husband James has left her for another woman, so Claire leaves London and moves back to Ireland with her endearing parents and sisters Anna and Helen. \\"Watermelon\\" is the trials and tribulations of how Claire copes with her family, the break up and becoming a single mum to baby Kate. <br /> <br />I think my favourite character must be Helen and I hope to God Marian writes a book from Helen's perceptions as she did with older sisters Rachel and Maggie (\\"Rachels Holiday\\" and \\"Angels\\") because Helen is so self involved and over confident that you just can't help but like her. I know that sounds crazy, but she's so damn likeable with her wonderful one liners and total knack at managing to stir up any situation. <br /> <br />It's neither deep nor profound. It probably won't change your life but that's what's so wonderful about it. Marian Keyes is British chick-lit at it's best.
B000003N8R|5.0|I think crescent is one of John Coltrane's five best albums. It's one of his first albums I got and I have always loved it. It was recorded in 1964 right before A love supreme and in my opinion it is as good. The best songs are Crescent and Lonnie's Lament. The songs are pretty long the longest being 11:45. If you don't have this album make shure it's the next album you get.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is seriously one of the most enthralling children's books that I have ever read. It has become almost a bible for other books on the same subject. Like Tolkein's Lord of the Rings was for fantasy, Watership Down will inspire animal story writers for ages to come.  <br /> <br />This is a story of rabbits. Yes, I know that may sound stupid, but never have the characters of a novel had so much personality, been so brave, touching and winning. It is about Hazel, a calm, sensitive, level-headed rabbit, born to be a leader, Bigwig, a rabbit with a flaming temper and a strong will, and Fiver who can tell when bad things are coming.  <br /> <br />The story begins when Fiver senses one such bad thing and convinces Hazel, his brother, to gather a small group of rabbits and leave their warren in Sandford, England. So begins their journey.  <br /> <br />The rabbits travel until they find a perfect place to begin a new warrren-watership down. Unfortunately, every time you think the rabbits will settle down and everything will be alright again, things get shaken up and once more the reader gets pages of breath taking action.  <br /> <br />Also, this book is encredibly well written. every page must have taken great care. For instance, the first and last sentence are both about primroses. Then there are the wonderful El- ahrairah stories. I loved them all. One of them even made me cry. They are beautiful stories about the legendary rabbit hero, El- ahrairah, and the rabbit God, Frith. Sometimes, amusing, sometimes tragic, sometimes refreshing, they added an extra layer to the story.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, do not be put off by the fact that this book is about rabbits. It is brilliant. It deserves a place of honour on every bookshelf.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Often criticized for being self-indulgent, ill-focused, and overlong, the Clash's \\"Sandinista!\\" actually has it all--and in 1980, nobody had all this: funk, reggae, New Orleans jazz scat-singing, gospel, rock, dub, Latin beats plus punk intensity. The Clash were one of the first rock bands to experiment with a new style they discovered on the NYC streets: rap. It's showcased to great effect on the opener, \\"The Magnificent Seven,\\" about the drudgery and soul-deadening effects of the modern workaday world:<br /><br />\\"Ring, ring, seven a.m.<br />Move yourself to start again<br />Cold water in the face<br />Brings you back to this awful place...\\"<br /><br />Throughout the album, the band aligns itself with the world's downtrodden, less fortunate citizens. In the last verse of \\"Washington Bullets,\\" Joe Strummer goes around the world and finds political oppression and corruption everywhere he goes:<br /><br />\\"If you can find an Afghan rebel<br />that the Moscow bullets missed<br />Ask him what he thinks of voting Communist<br />Or ask the Dalai Lama in the hills of Tibet<br />How many monks did the Chinese get?<br />In a war-torn swamp ask any mercenary<br />And check the British bullets in his armory\\"<br /><br />The challenges the Clash set up for us were in the way they refused to act in their own best interests; they made you figure out what was going on in the larger world. They looked behind the headlines, the media blitz, the empty pop stars, to find people in all those tragedies. \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\" is a perfect slice of life (and death), with Mick Jones' understated whisper so compassionate, vivid, and effective: \\"Somebody got murdered/Goodbye, for keeps, forever/Somebody's dead forever/His name cannot be found.\\"<br /><br />You have to let this album insinuate its way into your head and guts over time. The songs will reveal themselves. They attack British provincialism and class \\"warfare\\" in the marvelous \\"Something About England,\\" with Jones the curious youth and Strummer the embittered war veteran.

B0002S94OS|5.0|If there was ever an album that made me feel so patriotic and so enraged at the state of our country today, this is it. Not since Rage Against the Machine has there been a band that sounded the call of revolution as loudly as Lamb of God. There is a majority of people who know that we are going in the wrong direction and need to take matters into are own hands at a grassroots level. Music should make people want to change the world for the better instead of just whining about the price of gas and thier plummeting stock portfolios. These guys are a American as it gets, just a bunch of rednecks who drink alot and would knock G.W's d**k in the dirt where it belongs if they got close enough. The only band I've ever seen that makes more intense moshpits than Lamb of God is possibly Slayer or Slipknot, spoken from experience. The people who rated this album 1 star and reccomended some emo trash (Brian, Fear Before the March of Flames sucks my nipples and cries)are the people who get their musical preferences from Mtv and their little sisters. Not one of them would know the rush of charging a mosh pit at a Lamb of God show to ride the wave of fury to the front so you can scream \\"You finally made it home draped in the flag that you fell for\\" right in Randy's face as you look at his vicious visade calling for war against tyranny.
630460288X|2.0|I have an old copy of this movie that I taped off HBO several years back and this DVD has more picture quality problems that the tape.  Random spots, flashes, and obvious pixelation in several spots.  Maybe it will look better if I'm not watching it on my computer....no such luck. <br /> <br />Buyer beware, wait for a rerelease of this one even it it is 3 times more expensive or buy it locally so you can exchange it for another copy.  Good Luck
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has long been noted for crafting infectious tunes that are able to impress mass audiences on first listen. I would say her albums are another story. The ear-candy nature of many of the tracks obscures the coherence and depth of artistry that has gone into the work. This is probably a key reason why many critics continue to underestimate her musical abilities and withhold from her the respect that someone else with her track record of success would have garnered long ago. Erotica, is a prime example. When it first came out, I remember it being savaged by critics and I myself wasn't particularly enthralled by it (though I did love a few of the singles). After repeat exposures, however, I now consider it to be one of the most tremendous achievements by a female pop music artist of the last 20 years -- provocative, fierce, challenging, and way ahead of its time in both form and content. <br /> <br />When I first heard Madonna was doing a disco album, i thought the idea was just plain dumb, wrong-headed and a desperate bid to hold on to the limelight by recycling her past glories. The debut of the first single \\"Hung Up\\" only reinforced my sense that this was an artistic wreck of a project. Yes it was incredibly catchy, but somehow I didn't think it quite matched the high standards set by her best singles. After listening to the album on VH1 a few times, however, I think I was wrong about my initial thoughts. Rather than being the vacuous piece of work that I had expected, Confessions on the Dance Floor once again finds madonna using the sound, rhythms and textures of various popular music genres to shape another compelling emotional journey. The songs really do flow and build on each other. I'm still not that crazy about \\"hung up\\" as a single, but within the context of the album, it works beautifully. I hadn't planned on buying this album, but I certainly will be now. At this point, I don't think it's a 5 start album (more like 4.5) but I'm giving it a 5 to counter the ludicrous 1 star reviews of many who have posted here.  <br /> <br />I'd also like to comment on the lyrics which many people have criticized (particularly for \\"I love new york\\"). Sure, they sound stupid when they're printed on the page. But they do work while you are listening to music. And this perhaps, Madonna's true genius as a songwriter... unlike most, she realizes that lyrics need to work within the song, not necessarily on the page.  <br /> <br />On a side note, listening to Confessions has made me want to go out and buy, American Life. I didn't buy it because I was turned off big time by the title track. Since then, I've heard the tracks \\"nothing fails\\" and \\"x-static process\\" and was just bowled over by the strength of the songwriting and production on these two numbers. Certainly not your typical madonna songs but they are in my opinion among her greatest, even if they received minimal radio play. I am going out to buy American Life just on the strength of these two songs. And I'm sure that once i listen to that album, that the title track will make a lot more sense within the context of the album.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I came to read reviews about mariah's cd. Not J.Lo! J.Lo can't be compared to mariah at any point in time. J.lo is a no singing, better actress than singing broad. All the J.Lo lo lives get off this page and go on J.lo where you belong. Anywayz. This Cd is good! \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is very good. Her most brillant album yet!
B000AP04NI|1.0|I bought the 50th Anniversary 2-DVD of Oklahoma! After reading all the scathing reviews concerning the horrible quality of the Todd-AO version on disc two (which I happen to believe), I have returned my unopened copy.<br />Releasing a DVD of such inferior quality, especially of such a beloved classic, is simply inexcusable. I hope that Fox gets a ton of complaints and suffers where it REALLY will hurt them, in both their profits and credibility.  For Fox to knowingly distribute such a poor product is disgraceful, and ALL consumers should voice their opinions VERY STRONGLY. Otherwise this kind of garbage will go unchecked. I only wish I knew where to contact Fox with my comments. Anybody know? Thanks.<br /><br />BTW, if you've never seen Oklahoma!, it's a beautiful movie musical adapted from it's origins on Broadway. The songs are all classics, and include \\"Oh What a Beautiful Mornin'\\", \\"The Surrey With The Fringe On Top\\", and \\"Oklahoma!\\" The  sweet love story from a bygone era (just before Oklahoma became a state), centers around a cowboy, his sweetheart, and the man who trys to come between them. There are plenty of laughs, dance, song, and drama, along with a stunning dream ballet sequence.  It deserves a much better treatment than what it's getting in this 50th Anniversary Edition. I understand that the CinemaScope version on disc one is fine. Small consolation.<br /><br />P.S. To add further insult, Fox now adds a disgusting Anti-Piracy/Copy commercial on their currently produced DVDs that REALLY should be aired on TV or mentioned in the newspapers! These ads DON'T belong on DVDs that HONEST consumers are purchasing...after all, THEY ARE NOT THE CRIMINALS!!!! Another moronic move by Fox.
0316172324|4.0|\\"Blink\\", by Malcolm Gladwell <br /> <br />This was a fun book to read. I've always been fascinated by my powers of intuition, and have long wondered how to more effectively - and proactively - tap into them. Mr. Gladwell analyzes various aspects of our intuitive natures, and his use of real-world examples helps to demonstrate how to apply various techniques he explains in the book. He also provides insights into a means of tapping into our self-conscious minds. Contrary to everything I'd read previously, this appears to be a skill which can be acquired with practice. <br /> <br />The chapter on mind reading was also quite interesting; although I must admit I skimmed over the section which articulated the names of each of the facial muscles (there certainly are many!). I'd never before noticed how peoples' ability to read minds is so dependent on minute facial expressions. <br /> <br />Having read Mr. Gladwell's book, I now feel equipped to progress my intuitive skills by using the tools his book has provided. <br /> <br />If you're interested in intuition and \\"being in the moment\\" - which is a requirement if you wish to use your intuitive powers - you should   <br />definitely read another wonderful book authored by Ariel and Shya Kane entitled, \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\". This is a really fun book to read and offers an easy approach to living in the moment, and tapping into your natural intuitive abilities. Both are highly recommended!
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album has many great songs. A great collection. Britney Spears <br />is without a doubt the best singer of her generation!
B00005JO1P|5.0|President Jimmy Carter said after seeing \\"Cold Miner's Daughter\\" that the movie was much better than he expected. The same could be said about this film and then some. These kinds of movies often fall flatter than a young bride's first baked biscuits. This one doesn't. Joaquin Phoenix (\\"Hotel Rwanda\\" and \\"Gladiator\\") is just about perfect as Johnny Cash. He resembles him both in appearance and in his voice-- he does all the Cash songs himself-- and Reese Witherspoon (\\"Legally Blonde\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\") convinced me that she was June Carter. (She sings June's songs herself as well.) Witherspoon captures the essence of the character with both her humor and decency. (It is common knowledge that Cash gave June and her mother Maybelle Carter the major credit for his getting off drugs and turning his life around.)<br /><br />Some of the minor characters are miscast. Elvis Presley for one. With more Elvis impersonators now alive than ever before in history, it is inconceivable that a better Elvis couldn't have been found. On the other hand, some of the actors with cameo parts are quite wonderful: Mother Maybelle, Johnny's mother in middle age with her cat-eye glasses and Pentecostal hairdo and the bank teller who refuses to cash Cash's check, for instance.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes are those in which Phoenix sings. When he auditions for Sam Phillips at Sun Records, after trying a tired version of the then popular religious song \\"I Was There When It Happened,\\" he breaks into a gritty, soulful version of \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" worthy of the Man in Black, himself. The concert at Folsom Prison with June in the wings is electric as well; then there is the concert in Canada where Cash proposes to Carter before an enthusiastic audience that will make your eyes water.<br /><br />Director James Mangold (\\"Kate & Leopold\\" and \\"Girl, Interrupted\\") does an excellent job of keeping Carter and Cash's relationship from becoming too sentimental and also prevents the film from turning into a religious tract since Carter and Cash became devout Christians. (Only once does June say that God has given Johnny a second chance to make something of his life.) They are portrayed here as what they apparently were in real life, two less than perfect but decent, talented people who had one of the great contemporary love affairs that spanned almost forty years. Trite as it may sound, \\"Walk the Line\\" is ultimately about the enduring power of love. This is a film you will want to see again. The soundtrack is quite fine and stands on its own. Phoenix's talent as a singer is the biggest surprise of the movie. He and Witherspoon are likely Oscar contenders for their performances.<br /><br />Apparently Johnny Cash approved of having Mr. Phoenix play him in this movie. It is sad that neither he nor his wife lived to see this production. They would both have loved it.nto a religious tract since Carter and Cash became devout Christians.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|This movie might be remembered for THE movie that brought down Disney's profitability this year.  There's nothing wrong with \\"Dark Water\\".  Impressive director, screenwriter and cast made this a resolute & intelligent movie.  However, it's missing an important ingredient and the sorely lacking potent ingredient is what prevented the audience from flocking to the cinemas in droves.  \\"Dark Water\\" is one of those movie that could be appreciated at home.  The essence of heading to cinema is to scare ourselves witless with those over-the-top soundtrack & gore factor.  \\"Dark Water\\" is never meant to be made to target at the younger crowd and thus, the lacklustre result.  Jennifer Connelly's previous movie, \\"Hulk\\" shared the same fate.  They are good movies but simply underappreciated.  Pete Postelwaite, John C Reilly, Jennifer Connelly were brilliant here but scary moments were far in between.  Towards the half of the movie, we already could guess the end-result and its plot.  As a result, the movie became the victim of the genre's success as it 'educated' the audience of what to expect.  Please  be mindful that the extras provided in the DVDs are quite negligible.  Commendable movie.
0553801503|2.0|I am disappointed. This book is a drag. I can't believe it is by the same author. It is like watching a movie without editing, with all the shots thrown in, whether they drive the story or not. <br /> <br />As a novel it hardly stands on it own.  <br /> <br />What bothers me most is Cersei's story at Kindlanding. They read like one long monologue and it isn't over yet. In Storm we get the picture that she is a cunning seductress, the evil who brought down Eddard. Here Martin makes her sound stupid and takes too many chapters to do so. In comparison with other court dramas at Kingslanding: Eddard's entire journey to Kinglandeing and its end is covered in just 1 book, with more fare and room to spare. Tyrion at Kingslanding is well done as he gets to play off his wit against the main cast, whereas here Martin surrounded Cersei with maids, court ladies, minor lords whose names I forgot already. <br /> <br />The Briene chapters should be cut down to 1. She spent the first few roaming in circle. <br /> <br />The Samwell and Jamie chapters need cut down as well. The Arya chapters are okay. <br /> <br />There is also quite of bit of characters reminiscing the past. We don't need to reminded. It is insulting. I felt like loyal readers are getting milked for the words. <br /> <br />For the amount of coverage the Iron Born get, they better play some main role in the future. But if they do, with sheer number of cast involved already, I doubt Martin could be explain it all in 7 books.  <br /> <br />There is the idea that this is a set-up book to cover the \\"5-year-gap\\", but 1) at the slow pace it goes we would need 4 books just to cover any \\"5-year-gap\\", 2) frankly, the set-ups made here, boring as they are, are not worth paying for. I prefer to spend my money on good story. I can check up on the set-ups on any internet spoiler sites... <br /> <br />As the story goes I assume we would eventually wrap up the human affair and get ready for battle against the mythical evil up north. At the pace of AFOC, we would need 10 books and more to tell it all. I don't think I have patience for it. <br /> <br />The epilogue on Dany is anti-climatic. <br /> <br />I hope Martin gets back to the his old shape in Dance.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|This movie does not, by any means, do justice to the Grimm fairy tales that it's based on. The performances, while none particularly deserving of a barrage of negativity, are all flippantly over the top and sentimental throughout the movie's shorter-than-felt running time of 118 minutes. And the music... at times made me feel like I was watching a parody of some mushy romance, among other things (I can't say what, but the score is definitely better suited elsewhere than for the half-baked themes of this run-through-on-celluloid. As one critic insightfully pointed out, the movie is gravely \\"frustrating,\\" and I say this on the viewer's part.  Sure we get the visceral treats, after all they are the hallmark of all Terry Gilliam films but is here perhaps the only thing he is truly keen about delivering; little else besides has the potential of bestowing the audience a sense of genuine gratification. The movie, an unvarnished and bizarre hybrid of comedy, horror, fantasy, thriller and sheer eye-candy, is not only virtually plotless but is also plagued consistently by not knowing which of the aforementioned it wants to be. In the end, I can't help thinking the innumerable ways to better expend the $80,000,000 it cost to piece this mediocrity together. What a shame.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it in theatres.  Carrey once again proves his acting prowess, and I liked Kate Winslet much more in this role as the quirky Clementine.  Charlie Kauffman is one of the best filmmakers currently working (in my mind, it's a toss-up between him and Cameron Crowe) and his creativity and brilliance comes through in full force here.  Despite the science fiction element, when watching this movie the characters feel real.  You will believe their relationships and enjoy their reminscense.  A wonderful film.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|The 2005 version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is much easier for me to take than the original.  Since we must compare the two, I will have to say that Gene Wilder's Wonka was just creepy.  I can't imagine that this is what Mr. Dahl had in mind.  Depp provides a mix of innocense and mischief that are truly child-like and come off as hilarious and so very entertaining.  The Oompa Loompahs are no longer creepy and much more enjoyable to look at - using the same man is genius.  The enire film is genius.   <br /> <br />And a huge thanks to Tim Burton for not including the weird acid trip garbage in the tunnel ride.  In my opinion, that alone makes the 2005 version better than the original.
B000BGH22W|3.0|First off...this isn't a bad score.  In fact it has some very charming segments that tie very well into the \\"midevil\\" chamber orchestra feel laid out in prior films.  I was quite pleased to see that Doyle didn't go running back to the canon and pull out a rehesh of the themes by Williams.  Besides a hint hear and there of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" Doyle departed from set music and created his own world.  Such peices as \\"Cedric's Death\\" and the \\"Quiddich World Cup\\" are very dynamic and fun.  Unfortunatly Doyle did fall back into some musical motions that are far more pedestrian.  Some peices made me think of his other works and not of the world of Harry Potter at all.  It's understandable and not all together a bad thing, it's just a difference in motif and clarity.  Sometimes you've got a wall of sound with very little motion it, then again there are many that have quite a bit of depth and sincerity.  All in all it just didn't do it for me.  Doyle lacks the ability to bring his music to a head and then allow it to fade away in an action moment.  fliping this around his slow sad music is at times seems more heart renching than anything Iv'e heard from Williams.  It's a toss up,  I prefer big explosive music with depth and alot of sound varience, thus Williams is my cup of tea.  Then again Doyle has  a gift for the quiet and introspective.  So if you have read this review to this point and have any idea of \\"witch\\" I'm talking about, then you can deside for your self if shelling out $16 US for this peice is worth it.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|The first couple of times i listened to Playing the Angel i did'nt really like it but the more i listen the more i can't get enough of it. My favourites are The Sinner in Me and Nothing's Impossible. I'm even starting to like the tracks i thought i'd never like. Depeche Mode is my favourite group in the world- they are just awesome.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Here's what matters... Madonna has been able to keep people dancing for more than 20 years with fun beats and choruses. Madonna herself admits that she isn't the best singer or dancer.  And I agree, she isn't the best. Though, as an entertainer she has all the right elements for being a star. <br /> <br />\\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" is a perfect follow up to her much underrated yet honest and artistic \\"American Life\\" album. She gets back to basics by bringing us fun dance music for all to enjoy. And I mean it when I say \\"all to enjoy\\".  It's just one of those albums with each listen, it grows on you <br /> <br />I will admit some of the lyrics seem a bit silly. For instance, the fifth track, we have a song called \\"I Love New York\\".  It's got a great sound and attitude, but the lyrics are a bit cheesy. It's definitely a song to honor her roots in NYC. It's all \\"tongue and cheek\\" and shouldn't be taken seriously. Anyone who can relate to that will appreciate this song. And besides the lyrics, it is a cool rock/dance song.  <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" may seem like the perfect choice as the lead single promoting this album, but there are other tracks that blow you away. <br /> <br />Three songs that come to mind are \\"Sorry\\", \\"Jump\\" and \\"Push\\".  These tracks are the real stars of the album. Each has it's own unique club thumping sound while lyrics are simplistic for anyone to relate to. Warners and Madonna would be a fool to not use these tracks as singles to further sell this album.  <br /> <br />\\"Jump\\" seems to be the universal favorite for many who listen to this song. It's quite friendly to the ears. The song can easily be anthems to High School dance themes across America.  <br /> <br />\\"Push\\" is very unique and probably the closest to R&B/Hip Hop we're going to get on the album. Warner and Madonna should use this song to further promote the album in the new year in America. It certainly can \\"push\\" the album to great success. <br /> <br />The closing track is my favorite, \\"Like it or Not.\\" It is Madonna doing what she does best, by churning honestly about how she feels about her fame and success. Many people can relate to it, no matter where you are at in life. The production of the song is awesome and it's definitely Madonna's theme song to her life.  <br /> <br />\\"Get Together\\" is another fun track lyrically and musically. It reminds me of the good ol' days when Madonna sang other huge hits of hers called \\"Holiday\\", \\"Into the Groove\\" or \\"Everybody\\".  It's all about \\"Getting together\\" and having fun. It may not be as infectious as \\"Holiday\\", but it's right up there.  <br /> <br />The production of this album is quite awesome. Stuart Price and Madonna had a sound in mind and went for it. While some (including myself) will say Madonna has brought forth a new kinda \\"disco\\", I certainly would say there's more to it than that. It has layers of sounds and lyrics that you hear \\"for the very first time\\" with each listen. Whether intentional or not, you swear you can hear elements of hit songs of the past including her own.  <br /> <br />The strings in \\"Let it Will Be\\" and \\"Like it or Not\\" remind you of her past hits, \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Die Another Day.\\" And of course, you can hear a sample of an \\"Abba\\" tune quite clearly on the leading track \\"Hung Up\\".  Other tracks contain elements of 70's and 80's music, including Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\" and The Jacksons \\"Can You Feel It\\".   <br /> <br />The album is definitely destined to be a huge club hit. Her fans will enjoy this album because it's exactly what many of them have been asking for several years. It's pure dance and fun. Non-fans can appreciate this for the same reasons.  <br /> <br />Madonna has once again showed the world that age nor her sex will keep her from entertaining the world. While radio in America may play her less (their loss) in exchange for younger teen pop or hip-hop, there's no doubt sales across the world prove that she's still relevant. People still want to hear her. People still love her for what she stands for and what she has to say. Everyone has at least one favorite Madonna track and most likely it's a dance tune whether they want to admit it or not.  <br /> <br />I recommend everyone to run out and buy this album. It may not be the greatest album you'll have in your collection, but it will be damn close.  Most importantly, it will always be fun to listen to today and 20 years from now.  <br />
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nightwish's newest album, at the time of writing this, is definitely worth the money. It has a very polished sound, and a lot more depth to the music. For example, the song Creek Mary's Blood features a very native american theme, complete with native american tribal vocals. The song The Siren features a very silky violin piece as well. All in all the CD is a must have for any Nightwish fan.  <br /> <br />However, personally I didn't like Marco's added vocals. He sings in some songs, and doesn't have the same talent as Tarja does.
B00028HBKM|2.0|A befuddled reviewer who hastens to write a review of this movie&#8212;with eyes and ears still dazed from watching it&#8212;would be quick to conclude of its greatness. The result? Five stars. Talk of cinematic hypnotism. But if a reviewer is incisive and subtle enough to penetrate into the soul of the creator through the intricate disguises of the medium, then he could discuss it with much deeper understanding. You see, the film is full of hidden motives. Let us examine it. <br /> <br /> Throughout the entire movie, there is an effort or a recurring motif of presenting a constantly mellow, temperate, ever-suffering Christ. A usual criticism of the film is directed at its graphic violence. But this is better viewed in the light of our commentary. The spilling of voluminous amount of blood serves the purpose of our director&#8212;which is to present a far more acceptable image of Christ than which is presented in the Bible. Indeed, in watching the film, one would find it hard to believe that Christ, as portrayed by the soft-spoken Jim Caviezel, could be capable of drubbing his opponents in this manner (this is found in the Bible): &#8220;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Hell!&#8221; Compassion. This explains the movie&#8217;s appeal to our senses. <br /> <br />      But  Christianity is not only an &#8220;existential communication expressing an existential contradiction&#8221; (Kierkegaard). More than this, it is a metaphysical system of belief. In the length of the movie, the latter aspect of Christianity is never touched upon. Therefore, displaying its hideous side was cleverly avoided. But therein lies our objection. &#8220;Humility,&#8221; &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; are but foreground countenance of Christianity. Behind it lurks the terror of eternal punishment, the horror of damnation and divine retribution. Because Christianity is essentially a metaphysical doctrine of cruelty.  <br /> <br />      There is a scene in the movie that holds the key to the secret of the innermost nature of our director, perhaps as much as of Christ Himself. This is when Jesus falls to the ground and Mary rushes to help Him&#8212;with the undying glimmer in His eyes, He exclaims unto her: &#8220;See, Mother, I make all things new!&#8221; <br /> <br />      Could it be that the entire movie is nothing but paltry pomposity, and what the director reveals of himself and illustrates, far from being an art, is nothing but&#8212;an actor&#8217;s vanity? <br /> <br />

After working on Web sites for a while, some of us have slowly moved away from what we know is usable to adding or removing elements that may enhance the `look' - and also break a site's usability.<br /><br />Steer back on track with the new edition of Krug's highly referenced book. Novice, intermediate, expert. No matter where you are on the scale, the book provides value to everyone - even managers, testers and project managers. Management likes to get their hands a little dirty when it comes to Web design projects and sharing this book may make the team's life easier.<br /><br />Anyone involved with Web design or usability will recognize most, if not all, of the concepts covered in the book. What makes Don't Make Me Think usable is that it's a great checklist to ensure you've covered all the basics.<br /><br />Krug provides many before and after examples to show how a few changes can enhance a Web site's usability. The illustrations reinforce the concepts covered as well as how visitors use and read a Web site.<br /><br />As for the differences between the first and second editions, the second addition has three new chapters while usability testing shrinks from two chapters to one and with good reason.<br /><br />The testing chapter breaks down the testing process into digestible steps; complete with a script between the tester (user) and the person watching the tester. Too often, we've seen testing get mangled or ignored. With this chapter, teams might find themselves empowered and eager to do testing.<br /><br />The chapter on \\"Usability as common courtesy\\" explores how a site can make or break the \\"reservoir of goodwill\\" as Krug puts it. We arrive at a Web site with some goodwill and depending on how well the site meets or misses our needs; the goodwill level goes up or down.

B000AA305M|4.0|Life in Slow Motion is a fantastic album. David Gray has this way of writing lyrics that just eat into your soul, and this cd is no exception. <br /> <br />While I think White Ladder is his best work to date, this comes close. Better than A New Day at Midnight, Life In Slow Motion is a must for music lovers. <br /> <br />The One I Love gets the radio air time, but is not the best song on the cd. Slow Motion and Ain't No Love are my pick for the best songs on this cd. David Gray doesn't disappoint in his music. Life in Slow Motion is a mellow cd, you can listen to it to relax, but open you ears to the lyrics and the songs take on a whole new meaning.
B0007GAERG|1.0|\\"The Return of the Voice\\" it was heralded. More like the \\"Attack of the Screaming Mimi\\".  In the beginning, Carey's performance art consisted in the technically proficient rather than the emotional tonality. The post-Tommy years saw her dwindle that siren-like screech by leaning toward more hip-hop cred - sort of 'The Pornification of Mimi'. While those results were more laughable, at least the thought was more laudable, and thank the powers that be, more listenable, albeit never - ever - lovable. Well, to secure both audiences, `Mimi' juxtaposes both dichotomies to the nth degree. Her gift was never for inventive melody, it was for memorizing the Who's Who of producers and arrangers, but you know you're hard up when even the Neptune's come up empty handed and Jermaine Dupree feels lost. But mediocrity was always a comfortable bed for Carey to lie in - this commercial comeback garnered Mariah her biggest opening ever, and her 16th [or 17th] #1 single. But, count out artistry here - it's a genius marketing of a record company getting what they paid for. My grade:  C-
B00005JNEI|4.0|This is not strictly a documentary. It's only called a \\"documentary\\" because we don't yet have a genre called \\"political-essay-as-feature-film\\", even though that's quite obviously what this is. It doesn't aim to present \\"the facts\\" and let you decide for yourself - that's what the news is for (unless you're watching Fox). Rather, it's taking a particular view of certain facts and expressing it with maximum emotion. This is seen by some reviewers as unfair or somehow inappropriate in a feature film only because it happens so rarely in that medium. Not so in others. When the likes of Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly spew their conservative vitriol all over radio, television and print - or when Gore Vidal does the same for the liberals - nobody seriously accuses them of being \\"biased\\" for the simple reason that nobody expects to hear a list of facts. We expect to hear an argument, and that's what we get. They're arguing about policy and ideology from passionately held positions. That is precisely what Moore is doing here, no more and no less. As a fair and even-handed \\"documentary\\" it deserves 1 star. As a feature-length essay, it's highly effective. Love it or hate it, this kind of thing is essential in a democracy, and unavoidable. It's the automatically generated flipside of America's conservative media, the equal and opposite reaction that occurs by universal law. Get used to it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|My brother gave me this 2 DVD set after he had just about obliterated the discs.  \\"If you can get these to play, you'll absolutely dig them!!!\\"  So after about 3 hours of buffing the discs, they started coming back to life,  first the menu, then the songs and oh, man was it ever worth the sweat!  The first disc's highlights to me are from \\"The thing that should not be\\" through \\"hero\\".  This band, like any polished band, always lets each member take a solo to let that member's talents be shown.  The SFO is like some kind of monster member of the band here, and they don't dominate the disc but really show what genius the band and SFO conductor Micheal Kamen came up with in doing this.  Absolutely, even if there's just one Metallica song you like, GET THIS!  You'll wonder why you never took larger doses.  And ok James forgive me, but I ripped the audio from these so I can listen to them on my own personal mp3 player.  I don't advocate doing this in anyway whatsoever, but if you absolutely have to, YOU SHOULD!  Take the experience with you everywhere.  Ok.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have ever heard. There is not one track on this album i dont like and as much as i try to get my friends into this album its asthough they have a non-damian marley rule but i think hes amazing. I agree about the Legend thing but i think his music is similar but in a different category to Bob because his music is so fresh and different and bare truthful! and thts wat ppl need these days, someone like him to guide the way! I think the duets he did were a good way of getting through to people because although i think hes amazing a lot of ppl aint even heard of him! with people like Nas and Bobby Brown on his album and his feature on the Alicia Keys unplugged alot more people realise what he stands for and im sure in the next generations to come Jr Gong will be seen as one of the bests just like his dad! <br /> <br />I'm gone go see him perform next yr i cant wait! <br /> <br />XxXxSheneezxXxX

0312995423|3.0|This review is for the St. Martin's Paperback edition, February 2004, 530 pages of story.  DIGITAL FORTRESS was the first of Dan Brown's four novels.  Although originally published in 1998, DIGITAL FORTRESS did not enter the USA Today bestseller list until September 4, 2003, piggybacking on the ubiquitous THE DAVINCI CODE, which entered the list in March 2003.  DIGITAL FORTRESS remained on the list for 113 weeks, peaking at number 9.<br /><br />DIGITAL FORTRESS is a fast-paced techno thriller that supposes an ex-employee of the National Security Agency developed unbreakable encryption software, named the Digital Fortress.  Initially, this threatens the NSA's ability to snoop on the communications of the world's evil elements.  Dan Brown escalates this threat exponentially.<br /><br />Based on the veracity of Dan Brown's other novels, I assume the techno-stuff and lingo is precise, and that the descriptions of the NSA's facilities and inner workings are educated guesses after extensive research.  That's interesting, I suppose.  The chapters are short, some only a few paragraphs.  The longest is perhaps 13 pages.  The author interlaces suspense-laden scenes that force the reader to leap from one dangling vine to another.  At page 74, he is interrupting three point of view characters, on page 86, he adds a fourth.  By page 176, there are three more.  The short chapters are great for the harried, interrupted reader, such as a bored receptionist who can let the phone ring until she finishes the chapter.  The interlaced suspense, however, might tempt the reader, anxious to know what happens to Susan or David or Chartrukian, to continue well after bedtime.<br /><br />The plot in thriller genre novels is typically incredible, but usually does not become absurd or silly until close to the ending.  DIGITAL FORTRESS disappointed me early, on page 39, when NSA's snooping allegedly prevented \\"two nuclear close calls\\" on U.S. soil in the prior year.  This, and other whacky events on the same page were not necessary, and I worried they forebode the ridiculous.  I was right to worry.  DIGITAL FORTRESS escalates too soon, and then drags on with incredulous intensity that becomes more monotonous than suspenseful.  The writing is straightforward and okay, although I did grind my teeth on a couple of sentimental clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Although DIGITAL FORTRESS was Dan Brown's first novel, it was the last that I read.  If THE DAVINCI CODE had not pulled it onto the bestseller list, it would likely be out of print.  Read this is you are a fanatic for techno-thrillers, or if you are curious about how Dan Brown got started.events on the same page were not necessary, and I worried they forebode the ridiculous.

B000BC8TBE|5.0|Mariah Carey's original 1994 album \\"Merry Christmas\\" has well stood the test of time, being a favorite among the casual listener to the die-hard fan.  I fit in there somewhere in between the two - more than the casual listener but not quite the die-hard type.  Still, this album's one of my favorites, as well. <br /> <br />In this particular edition, Sony BMG Music and Columbia Records have reissued the album with a bunch of new material - including two newly recorded songs \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" and \\"Santa Claus is Comin' To Town\\" (Anniversary Mix).  Additionally, on a reverse side is a brand new DVD featuring eight Christmas music videos, including the fantastic \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" animated video (with clips from the classic claymated movie with Santa Claus) and the chilling \\"O Holy Night\\" performance. <br /> <br />The way Amazon.com has the track list set up isn't exactly clear.  So I'll explain it a little bit better down here. <br /> <br />CD Side: <br />01. Silent Night <br />02. All I Want for Christmas is You <br />03. O Holy Night - (by far the best version of this song) <br />04. Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) <br />05. Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) <br />06. Joy to the World <br />07. Jesus Born On this Day <br />08. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town <br />09. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing/Gloria In Excelsis Dea <br />10. Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child <br />11. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlement - Bonus Track <br />12. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town - (Anniversary Mix( Bonus Track <br /> <br />DVD Side: <br />- The Full Album in Advanced Sound <br />- The Bonus Tracks in Advanced Sound <br />- 8 Music Videos: <br />a. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town - Anniversary Mix (Claymation Video) <br />b. All I Want for Christmas is You <br />c. Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) <br />d. All I Want for Christmas is You - JD Remix <br />e. Joy to the World - Celebration Mix <br />f. O Holy Night <br />g. All I Want for Christmas is You - Black and White Version <br />h. Joy to the World - Live Version <br /> <br />The Album Itself - <br />From the first notes of the piano and Mariah's voice during the beginning of \\"Silent Night\\", a clear, soulful impression is left on the listener.  Chilling are the notes she hits in the opening number, but it's certainly not the album's peak.  \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" is the radio smash heard all over the world, and it's slowly on its way to becoming a Christmas standard.  Mariah wrote an amazing melody that will stay with you all day after listening to this track. <br /> <br />The third song \\"O Holy Night\\" is my personal favorite.  The arragement in the all time ultimate in my opinion - no one can sing those high notes like Ms. Carey.  The song has a oh-so-classy 1940s setting with modern twists and it's definately one you *won't* be skipping over.  \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" brings the listener up to party-mode again and is one that certainly delivers. <br /> <br />By song five, you may begin to see a certain pattern appear:   a slow song followed by a more upbeat, followed by a slow, followed by an upbeat, etc.  Yes, this pattern is throughout the entire album, but instead of annoying the listener, it actually cushions the album.  \\"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\\" is a sweet original number that many will enjoy.  \\"Joy to the World\\", honestly, is the only song on the album in my opinion not to fit the standard of greatness.  I just don't feel the soul in it.  Others may, but I just don't feel the spark on the track. <br /> <br />\\"Jesus Born on this Day\\" is a GREAT vocal track, and \\"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\\" certainly has a great spin.  Mariah's voice is definitive on this song.  It's anthem like - and that adds a great touch to a sheer classic.  \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing/Gloria\\" and \\"Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child\\" close out an absolutely incredible CD, leaving the listener in the TRUE Christmas spirit. <br /> <br />But wait!  There's more!  Thanks to this reissue, the new song \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" showcases Mariah's ability to sing with a very simple arrangement and I'm surprised she never released this song before!  And the new \\"Anniversary Mix\\" of \\"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\\" doesn't miss a beat.  Picking right up off the 1994 version, Mariah brings the song into the 21st century with ANTHEM vocals.  A little bit short maybe, but certainly not one to miss. <br /> <br />For the DVD Side, there's eight music videos that shine each in their own way.  The highlights in my opinion are \\"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\\" (Anniversary Mix), \\"O Holy Night\\", and \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\". <br /> <br />The \\"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\\" Anniversary Mix video is an animated claymation video, tying in with the story line of the movie with the same name.  You see a new Mariah Carey claymation character in scenes of the original movie and brand new scenes fitting with her, as well.  It's very cute, and definately enjoyable.  The video for \\"O Holy Night\\" is not the same audio as on the album.  It's a similar arragement, but changed vocally - adding excitement for the listener.  And the \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" video is basically Mariah running around in the snow having fun with Santa Claus and a puppy dog.  It's highly amusing and very adorable. <br /> <br />Over all, this album is certainly one not to miss.  Don't buy the earlier version, because this remastered, reissued one is now available!  Trust me, this is one holiday collection totally worth the purchase.
B000002VBY|4.0|After seeing the video for Screaming In The Night back in 1983 I decided to get Headhunter and I was glad I did! There is not a bad song on this solid album. The riffs crunch, the drums pound, the solos wail, and Marc Storace's vocals lead the assault. My favorite tracks are Eat The Rich (great riff and solo!), Screaming In The Night, Ready To Burn (chorus w/ Rob Halford), and Russian Winter. There is also a good cover of BTO's Stayed Awake All Night. Unfortunately Krokus would listen to the label (dick)heads and start putting out commercial crap for the rest of the 80's. But wait, they have returned with the rockin Rock The Block and all is well again in Krokusland! If you can find The Dirty Dozen you may want to grab that instead of Headhunter. There are six songs on it from Headhunter and some other Krokus Klassics.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|M' Lady - how we have missed you. Fleeing the English countryside, Madonna regains her throne as Queen of the Dance Floor, returning to the music that started it all. The woman who was once considered a flash-in-the-pan has released her tenth studio album (not counting soundtracks, singles, and greatest hits compilations). Appropriately entitled Confessions on a Dance Floor, the album more than lives up to its moniker, featuring a seamless, non-stop collection of delicious dance pop. The beat hardly ever slackens, and it's a timeless testament to Madonna that she can still boogie-woogie with the best of them.  Things begin with the ticking of a clock, a clever reference to time going forward, and perhaps backward, as the much-ballyhooed Abba sample comes slowly into prominence on lead-off track \\"Hung Up\\". Setting the tone for the entire album, the single promises that this will be the gayest dance album she's made in a quite a long while. For those wondering whether she had forsaken the gay audience who has never let her down, this is a glorious homecoming. A Queen among queens, Madonna always returns to the comfort of her core audience when the chips are down and the stakes are high. (Witness her surprise appearances at the Roxy and Misshapes in New York City, and a planned gig at G.A.Y. in London.) She knows where her bread is buttered, and nothing makes us happier than when she's burning up the dance floor. With \\"Hung Up\\" she stages a veritable disco inferno, and the video for it shows off her most spirited break-neck dancing since 1998's Ray of Light. Confessions may well be her best record since that work. Though lacking the lyrical majesty and epic import of Light, the words here are secondary to the music. And what a fine bit of dance music it is, recalling the disco fever of the 70's and 80's.  \\"Get Together\\" is pop confection at its sweetest, with Madonna chirping \\"Can we get together/ I really wanna be with you/ Come on, check it out with me,\\" just like the old days. Music and message come joyfully together on \\"Jump.\\" An unabashedly guilty romp, replete with syncopated hand-claps, it opens with Madonna stating, \\"There's only so much you can learn in one place.\\" It's an anthem that has run through her endless career, and an affirmation that even with all of the backward glances on the album (and there are quite a few), Madonna's sight is fixed unflinchingly on what is yet to come. That she backs the sentiment with such melodic magnificence is what makes her best songs so compelling, and nothing is more riveting than the third track, \\"Sorry.\\"  Easily the zenith of this club-ready dance-a-thon, \\"Sorry\\" is quite possibly her greatest dance song since \\"Vogue\\" strutted its stuff back in 1990. It races along with a thunderous bass-line, bad-ass attitude, and an empowering dismissal of a man who's done her wrong one too many times. A modern-day \\"I Will Survive\\", it is the centerpiece of the entire album, and wisely scheduled to be the second single. \\"Sorry\\" is destined for club glory - an instant classic that will have gay boys and scorned lovers viciously stomping out their vengeance beneath the disco ball.  In fact, Confessions references a number of club classics, along with a few of Madonna's own hits. There's the aforementioned Abba influence on \\"Hung Up\\"; \\"Future Lovers\\" borrows heavily from Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\"; \\"Jump\\" is vaguely reminiscent of \\"We Are Family\\" (with its \\"My sisters and me\\" line); \\"Push\\" picks up the lyrical chorus of \\"Every Breath You Take\\"; and \\"Let It Will Be\\" is a sonic reminder of the Eurythmics' \\"Sweet Dreams Are Made of This\\".   Along with the retro glimpses, Confessions echoes more recent influences as well. The vocoder-enhanced singing on \\"Forbidden Love\\" sounds like the lovechild of Daft Punk and Air, while \\"How High\\" could be a razor-sharp cut from the Scissor Sisters album. Despite these wide-ranging allusions, the album is essentially a Madonna record, and even when she's accessing her own vast catalog of the past twenty years (\\"Get Together\\" is a modern-day companion to 1983's \\"Holiday\\") the music is rooted firmly in the future.  Despite its highs, it wouldn't be a proper Madonna album without the obligatory bomb. Thankfully there's just the one. In this case, the lone bum track is \\"I Love New York.\\" What could have been a sassy ode to the night-life of her favorite city is instead a rock-tinged stinker, with inane lyrics decrying other cities and a lazy chorus that almost puts a stop to the otherwise spectacular proceedings. Fortunately it's followed by the incendiary \\"Let It Will Be.\\" When she wails, \\"Just watch me burn,\\" and the bass kicks in, it's an irresistible hands-in-the-air get-thee-to-the-dance-floor hole-in-one.  It's a relief to note that her knack for a catchy hook and killer chorus has returned, following its brief absence on 2003's American Life.  Though that album was unfairly judged as anti-American (its release came at a time of ridiculous patriotic fervor), some of it did fall flat, and the worst of it sounded like Madonna was simply going through the motions. On Confessions, the hunger is back in her voice, the spunk is back in her step, and she's primed to pump it up like never before. The fierce re-appearance of such pluck and attitude is apparent in the promotional performances for the new album.  On the recent European Music Awards, Madonna opened the show in thrilling trademark fashion. Resplendent in a purple leather jacket, knee-high amethyst platform boots, and reddish-blonde Farrah-feathered hair, our once-and-future Queen of Career-Enhancing Controversy stripped down to a daring violet leotard and crawled to the edge of the stage, all dangerous dcolletage and come-hither eyes. It was 1985 all over again, a time when Madonna performed virtually the same seductive crawl on the virgin MTV Video Music Awards. That year she mopped up the stage (literally and figuratively) with her infamous debut performance of \\"Like A Virgin\\". Returning to the scene of that iconic crime, Madonna proves that she still has it.  Over twenty years into an unprecedented, never-let-up pop superstar career, she continues on her merry way, doing her own thing, uncompromising and defiant as ever. In those two decades the one constant has been Madonna's presence and relevance. True, it's dimmed and waned at times, but name one other celebrity who has sustained mainstream success for such a long run.   The joy and exuberance of this album, two elements largely ignored in her recent work, is a fundamental factor to the fun of Confessions. A pleasant Halcyon reminder of a more carefree and innocent time when the world was just a spinning disco ball and the beat was all that mattered. This record is a mighty resurrection - both for Madonna and for dance music as well. Not surprisingly, it's never been needed more. As she once sang, \\"I know a place where you can get away, it's called the dance floor, and here what it's for.\\" No one knows that more than Madonna, and nobody does it better.
B000AL730O|4.0|I agree the song sounds in a lot like \\"People Get Ready.\\"  However, being an aging babyboomer, I have to say on first listen:  It sounds at the end JUST LIKE the feeling of DRIVING IN THE CAR in the late 1950s early 1960s (pre-Beatles).  It evoked the perfect memory of what that music used to be.  We all had a life and music was only part of it, something to relax to.   Worth it just for that, thanks, Sir Paul.
B00008S2VG|5.0|The most surprising thing about American Life, Madonna's new album, is that it isn't the incendiary piece of anti-war sentiment we have been led to believe through over-hyped media reports, but rather a remarkably tender musical rendering of one woman's ongoing journey. In fact, for perhaps the first time in her career, it is the music that is the shocker ~ Madonna has gone folk, though she tempers most of the cuts with an electro-sensibility that merges acoustic guitar with cutting-edge techno sounds, courtesy of co-producer Mirwais.  <br /> This techno-folk melding can be jarring at times, but Madonna manages to pull it all together, even including a Gospel choir for one of the cuts. Amalgamation has always been her strong point, and successfully combining such disparate forces completes the musical trajectory she launched with 2000's Music album.  <br />American Life is Madonna's electronic pastoral, with its ruminations on the American dream, Hollywood hollowness, and the redemptive power of love ~ all grounded with a heavy foundation of guitars. It is also her most religiously evocative piece, on a par with Ray of Light and Like A Prayer, with its spiritual references and search for meaning. <br />\\"I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew,\\" she spews on the title track, while she calls out to Jesus Christ on X-Static Process and Mother and Father. In the slow-building Nothing Fails she sings, \\"I'm not religious, but I feel so moved/Makes me wanna pray/Pray you'll always be here/ I'm not religious, but I feel such love, makes me wanna pray.\\" An interesting echo of the redemptive love she explored on Like a Prayer, Nothing Fails also features a choir, and the music is ultimately soaring, indicative of the transcending power of love as a spiritual force, a religious experience of its own.  <br /> Surprisingly, the album falters on the cuts that Madonna should have done best. Leaf-off shock-single and title track American Life is unusually disjointed, and it's a double shame, since the song contains three killer hooks that end up being wasted. Nobody Knows Me is, at its heart, an 80's style dance track, featuring extra thrusts, thumping booms, and excessive vocoder-use to disguise its humble origins, none of which is very effective. <br /> The best parts of American Life are when Madonna descends from self-righteous social critiques and speaks plainly ~ both lyrically and musically. At such moments she comes across as genuine and earnest. The guitar pose she adopted for her Music album turns out to be more than just a pose; guitars form the basis for the majority of songs and anchor the album more effectively than the thread of electronic beeps and blips. This is especially effective on the Cat Stevens-like X-Static Process, a tender love song which finds Madonna singing quietly over an acoustic guitar. \\"I'm not myself when you go quiet/ I'm not myself all alone at night,\\" she croons in a plaintive voice, giving herself over to love but holding onto her own sense of self. It is a thrilling moment in its sheer simplicity, and a melodic jewel that grounds the entire album. <br /> Guitars also propel the classic pop cut Hollywood, which manages to be both vintage and current, while the road-ballad Intervention is a harmonic masterpiece, with Madonna once again intoning her faith in love. <br />The real zenith of American Life may be Mother and Father. Superficially it seems just a hook-laden piece of pop genius, but the lyrics and delivery rank with her most blunt and revealing. Beginning in a child-like techno-coo, it sounds like standard Madonna - a pleasant throwback to her Like A Virgin days. Listen carefully however and you will hear the hurt and abandonment she felt over her mother's death, and the way in which it sent her on a lifelong journey to find such unconditional love. \\"I got to give it up, find someone to love me/ I got to let it go, find someone that I can care for,\\" she pleads as dance-fueling disco beats surroundher in the pop-music catharsis she has been going through for twenty years.  <br />American Life is a challenging listen, not as accessible or mainstream as some of her fans (and critics) might like, but Madonna has never pandered to anyone but herself and her own artistic ideals. And while it may not be an Easy Ride, at its best it is a fascinating and breathtaking one.  <br />
0553801503|5.0|War has exhausted the Seven Kingdoms, but peace still remains out of reach. Queen Cersie clings to every morsel of power, even though doing so puts her in debt to the crazed religious leaders and increases dissention among the great nobles. Jaime, Cersei's brother has lost a hand but seems to have gained some intelligence as a result. Still, can he, or is he even willing to be the strong arm behind the throne?<br /><br />Meanwhile, House Stark has been damaged with every male member either dead, assumed dead, or, in the case of Jon Snow, Eddard Stark's bastard son, condemned to the wall. Eddard's two daughters, Sansa and Arya are in hiding and disguise.<br /><br />With Stark apparently eliminated, the reborn dragons and the Targaryen princess distant rumors, and Cersei and the Lannister's with their hands full, the other houses stretch for power and survival. The Iron Islands raid, House Martell battles within itself for survival and for dreams of power, and the threat of the wild North beyond the wall continues to grow.<br /><br />Author George R. R. Martin continues his fascinating look at power, war, and magic in a medieval-style world. The SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series represents one of the most compelling modern stories of fantasy. Martin defies convention by killing many favorite characters, depicting characters from all sides with a combination of admirable and hateful chaacteristics, and providing an almost Shakespearean gravitas to the story. I don't recommend starting this series with A FEAST--it relies upon the back story, but the series is a must-read for fantasy fans and A FEAST is a powerful and welcome addition.

I started my admiration for Alicia with \\"Songs in A Minor\\" and was curious about a song title on this album.  I'm afraid I'm now a true fan.  Where's the next album?  That's my only question.  It \\"feels like Dragon Days!\\"  These comments come from a fan of country music and Celine Dion.  People who know me are scratching their heads.  Darling Alicia's heart is in this one and so is mine!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|One of, if not THE best, Madonna CD made.  The woman is simply amazing.  If you are into dance music...get this CD..you won't regret it!
0783225482|5.0|Buoyed by pioneering special effects and make up, DEATH BECOMES HER is a sharp and witty treatise on vanity and growing old.  Director Robert Zemeckis pulls out all the stops and gets delirously wonderful performances from his cast.  Meryl Streep, the consummate actress of our time, is excellent as actress Madeline Ashton, who steals nerdish Bruce Willis from her long-time friend, delightfully embodied by Goldie Hawn.  Both women, eager to stay young forever, visit the mysterious Isabella Rossellini (wonderfully campy) who gives them a potion for eternal youth.  What happens then is pure fun as both Hawn and Streep find themselves \\"dead\\" and needing plastic surgeon Willis to keep their bodies together.  Everyone involved seems to be having a good time and Streep is especially brilliant.  A delightful dark comedy.
B00005OAA6|4.0|i wasnt expecting something like this from the little<br /><br />mrs.pretty victoria beckam. this was actually pretty cool if<br /><br />you like pop music you should buy it!its great that shes still<br /><br />posh spice likes shes always been. her lyrics are amazing. i really never understood why she walked around being posh beacuase<br /><br />it doesnt look fun just walking arund all classy and showing your<br /><br />self off like she does. but like i said this is a good album if<br /><br />you love pop music you should buy it!
B0000U5RNU|4.0|Spoofing the spy genre is a popular thing to do---just look at AUSTIN POWERS, and in a genre that is almost self-parodying anyway (James Bond always had his tongue in cheek), it's to JOHNNY ENGLISH's credit that it manages to be so much fun.  The film's most hilarious gag is one of the first, involving English and some marauding Dobermans; and while some gags fall flat, there are enough genuinely goofy ones to sustain the movie's hilarity.  Rowan Atkinson is superb as the bumbling, inept spy who takes on a high profile case because all of the other agents were killed at the funeral of the Agent No. 1.  Ben Miller is delightful as English's assistant and pop singer Natalie Imbruglia is surprisingly effective as the femme fatale.  John Malkovich despite his horrible French accent is fun as the hedonistic and egomaniacal villain.  There are some pretty funny scenes and overall JOHNNY ENGLISH is very entertaining, if not necessarily brilliant.
B000BGH22W|1.0|I wouldn't waste any money on this score. It lacks the magic that John Williams gave. Doyle scored this as if it were a random british action film. The movies are about a world of magic, and the score should reflect that. And simply the fact that Doyle did not start the films with the same cue that williams did on the first three warrants this score as bad. I hate to think what Doyle would have done if he got his hands on Star Wars. The most dissapponting track was 'Voldemort.' There is so much room for some amazing thematic rise but there is only incoherant loud crashes and bangs. If thats what your into, buy Goldenthal's Batman score. In fact, buy any other score than this one.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane's album \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is absolutely stunning. It's beautiful piano and drums match perfectly with the angelic singing. Every song is emotionaly different and unique. There no other artists that could ever match Keane! Anyone who isn't immediately caught by their music must be crazy.
B000002VCT|4.0|From the rise and fall of an ancient dynasty, to the quest for a key to unlock the secrets of the universe, this album seeks to amplify the haunting echoes of the past and explore the unsolved mysteries to the present. Pyramid... the last remaining wonder of the ancient world.<br /><br />This album does include songs which really sound mysteriously. it begins with the great instrumental Voyager, really mysterious and no one could  have done that better than The Alan Parsons Project. This one is followed by What Goes Up... This one is also mysterious but it isn't instrumental. The Eagle Will Rise Again is the best song of the album sung by Colin Blunstone. It contains a mysterious sound as well and that's mostly because of the good vocals. On More Road is a real letdown. It starts nice, but the chorus stinks. I just don't like the way Lenny Zakatek sings here. The next song Can't Take It With You is average. Nothing is wrong with the vocals or something like that. I just think it's weak. But fortunately the next song returns to the mysterious side of the album. In The Lap Of The Gods is very good and instrumental. At pop-albums I usually skip the instrumental songs, but this one is a song you can't skip! Pyromania is a song with a positive influence to the one who listens it. You really get a good feel after hearing this funny song with John Miles' voice. Hyper-Gamma-Spaces is an instrumental song that I do skip. The album closer Shadow Of A Lonely Man is very good again.<br /><br />This album ain't bad at all. It's pretty good, but it's worth 4 stars in my opinion, because of the few less good songs. I recommend this item to every Alan Parson fan and to people who just like pop music.<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!!!!!!
B00008S2VG|4.0|When I received this album, I have to admit that my enthusiasm was not very high.  The album was getting middling reviews, and at this point Madonna was coming off the much-maligned \\"Swept Away\\", so the knives were already out for her!  Yet, to my surprise, I actually enjoyed  \\"Swept Away\\", and it was the same situaiton with this album - it's actually a good album.   <br /> <br />As an album, it is cohesive, and the songs fit well together, and there are a number of gems here including \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Love Profusion\\" (classic Madonna pop), \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\" (which harkens back to \\"Like A Prayer\\"), \\"Mother and Father\\" and the unfairly maligned Bond track, \\"Die Another Day\\".  I also like \\"I'm So Stupid\\" which is one of Madonna's rare rock songs like \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\".   <br /> <br />I hope listeners give this album a second chance.  You might be surprised... <br /> <br />
B00004Z459|5.0|I don't like Rap music, but I heard Linkin Park, and this rocks the whole world. Rap combined with Metal is not always a good idea, but this band got the idea and brought it to a good end!!! Hybrid Theory, a must have for every metal fan. There aren't any guitar solo's on the album, but who cares, solo's don't fit in this style. The best songs are Papercut, One Step Closer, In The End and Pushing Me Away. There are no bad songs. You'll be freaked out after hearing this album.<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is one of her best. It has a great beat and is also very revealing as well, one of the things I love most about her.
B000063DIH|4.0|My third Iron Maiden album. I really like this album, the songs are almost all good. But 4 of them are not really Iron Maiden songs: Fear Is The Key, From Here To Eternity, The Apparation and Weekend Warrior. That's too bad for them, cause 4 is a lot, so it might just destroy their image. But I still like the album, and a 4-star rating is enough I guess. Unfortunately, Bruce seems to like to screw with his voice, he sings like an old woman. Sorry for that offensive language, but he is much better on albums before 1990.<br /><br />Let's have a closer look at the album:<br /><br />Be Quick Or Be Dead: 10/10<br /><br />From Here To Eternity: 8/10 (I know I mensioned it, but it's  still good)<br /><br />Afraid To Shoot Strangers: 10/10<br /><br />Fear Is The Key: 6/10<br /><br />Childhood's End: 8/10<br /><br />Wasting Love: 8/10 (ballad)<br /><br />The Fugitive: 9/10<br /><br />Chains Of Misery: 9/10<br /><br />The Apparation: 7/10<br /><br />Judas Be My Guide: 10/10<br /><br />Weekend Warrior: 6/10<br /><br />Fear Of The Dark: 10/10
1401902197|5.0|This is a lovely card set with beautiful and positive affirmations that are soothing and inspring. I enjoy picking up a card at the start of the day just to see which message I receive, and it always seems to be something that I need to hear. The images are lovely and the messages on the cards are uplifting.
B00005J79H|5.0|Wow, the Scorpions are here in 2001, and they still know how to make live music. Acoustic this time, which means almost only ballads are played, well it is very good, and all the songs are have nice acoustic sounds. Catch Your Train is very swinging, with the piano, and Holiday has a very specific sound, which is a little swinging as well. There are some new songs too, so if you can, buy it. you won't regret that.<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!!
B000B8QF14|5.0|I was very impressed with Bullet In A Bible, it shows Green Days maturity in songs like Are we the waiting, Wake me up when september ends and Boulevard of broken dreams, and their chaotic side with tracks like Brain stew, King for a day and Basket case plus great anthemish songs Jesus of suburbia and holiday and ending with an amazing rendition of Good Riddance. At the end you're left exactly where should be after a great punk show, questioning everything even you're own existence and very satisfied. <br />Overall it has all you could ask for with inside views on what the songs mean to the band, great live footage and impressive sound quality for a live show.  <br />With the passings of Joey, Dee Dee, and Johnny Ramone and Joe Strummer (the clash) its good to see punk rock is still very much alive.GREAT JOB !!!!!!!!!
B000001IQH|5.0|This album is by far the dominant punk-pop (notice I put punk first) album of the mid nineties.  While 'Dookie' might have ruled the airwaves and Billboard charts, this album is superior in every way shape and form.  Energetic songs, great songwriting, and amazing bass lines.  If you don't own this album, you should.
B000068FUS|2.0|.<br />I've listened to tens of thousands of albums, and this is certainly one of them.<br /><br />Listening to this reminded me of watching the backwards-playing movie Memento. I don't know if I really liked it, but it was interesting.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this album.  Many of these tunes show promising starts but to me get bogged down in tired vocals and second-hand loud playing.  Like a fence post on an abandoned farm, the songs just sit there. For no apparent reason. Critic reviews were -as stated by a few other respondents- glowing.<br />Many of the songs kick-start with a promising guitar riff, but slowly deconstruct into fuzzy noodling and horrific singing.  I mean the playing occasionally makes you think something great is just around the bend, but it is a dead end, for the most part.<br /><br />I mean they are certainly passionate about their roots.  I dropped acid at a Robin Trower concert too, but I didn't waste people's time by recording 2 cds worth of minutia about my experiences and how it changed my life.<br /><br />The lyrics are sort of a narrative, story telling format that go a little like this, like a 5th grade school paper: \\"Woke up this morning, had a bowl of corn flakes, heard a dog barking, and shot him dead. Lynard Skynard is a great band\\". That sort of garbage.  And in mind crap is crap.  Most of these words rung shallow as an ash tray, and empty as a beer can.  The spoken word songs, I found to be more enjoyable.  Cause most of the rest of this sucks more than an empty keger on a Friday night.  I just wanted to shout out at my CD player, \\"Will you Shut up and get on with it already!\\"<br /><br />Hey, Lynyrd Skynyrd is a great rock band, with several classics, but this is no LS.  I also like Neil Young.<br />But I have 3 words for a band that repeatedly sings songs that include song after song after song after song about Ronnie & Neil.  Get over it!<br /><br />I found \\"3 Great Alabama icons\\" interesting, certainly from historic perspective, the information of racist Governor George Wallace was eye opening.<br /><br />There are a fist full of nice songs pocketed toward the end of side two: \\"Life in the Factory\\" rocks, \\"Cassie's Brother\\" (primarily NOT sung by the band), \\"Shut Up\\" is good driving rock. \\"Angels & Fuselage\\" a decent ballad.<br /><br />Skip the second hand licks and goat-roper strained, whiskey'n' razorblades garbled vocals. Stick with the originals; spend your blue collar dollar on \\"After the Gold Rush\\" or \\"Harvest\\" or \\"Everyone Knows this is Nowhere\\" or L.S.  Personally I think these guys are less street survivors and more grease spill on the lost rock highway.<br /><br />Get out the way of this southern thing.<br /><br />p.s. ditto for their other CD, the Dirty South too. Yawn.ace was eye opening.

0553274503|5.0|Flowers for Algernon <br />      by Daniel Keyes <br /> <br />                   This is one of the best books I've ever read. It made me think a lot. Maybe I liked it so much, because I was a psychology major. But this book made me think, which is something that the majority of books these days just don't do. <br /> <br />                   Charlie is a mentally-challenged man. When the doctors' experimental surgery, to increase intelligence  <br />works successfully, they want to try it out on him. His friendship with Algernon was very touching. <br />                  <br />                  This book was happy, but also sad. I give this book my highest rating, and I truly recommend it:)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|No need to think. Purchase this set and enjoy. I was absolutely blown away with everything about the series. It's so sad it was cancelled. Hope someone brings them back in the near future.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions on a dance floor is Madonna at her best. Every song on The CD is great including the new hit single \\"Hung up\\" which is my personal favorite on the CD.Other great Songs on the CD are \\"Sorry , I Love New York , furture lovers , and practally every other song. You Did it Madonna The New Album is a succes and is right at the top at your best ! Highly Recomended
B00008BXJG|5.0|By 1979, AC/DC was known throughout the world, except for the U.S., but a live album, big touring, and an appearance on Midnight Special was opening American eyes. And with the young, untried Mutt Lange as producer, the time had come. Angus & Co. were in top form here. The album marks a big change. It was Powerage that the group really got their sound and image standardized (is that a word?), playing off the no nonesense approach of Let There Be Rock. Highway To Hell is like a more menacing version of Back In Black. Bon's wheeze and spatter are high and dry here. His voice is just a bit more elfen on this record. Angus blows out the usual solo shtuff and the rhythm is held strong by Malcolm & Phil & Cliff. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />\\"Shot Down In Flames:\\" For once, Bon's havin' trouble even GETTING a woman! <br />\\"Get It Hot:\\" The only old school rocker on the album (like \\"Show Business and \\"Rocker\\"). Tis a fun romp of rock. <br />\\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It):\\" Just really really catchy. It rocks hard and strong. <br />\\"Beating Around The Bush:\\" Fast paced rocker with meaty riffing by Angus. <br />\\"Highway To Hell:\\" The most famous of Acker Dacker's numbers, this little tell of hard livin' is CLASSIC. What more to say? <br /> <br />As any schoolboy knows, Bon Scott died six months after thy made it big with this album. Sad that he tasted the big fame for so short of time. His legacy? Denim vests, sex, and a big long stretch of Hades road that is this classic album
B000BO0LLS|1.0|The only thing more pathetic than Mariah Carey herself is her stupid \\"lambs\\" who have to keep posting 1-star reviews of Madonna's new cd over and over again.  These are the same 4 children who must be around 12 years old because they can't even spell.  And looking at the reviews (if you can call them that) you can tell they haven't even listened to Confessions on a Dance Floor.  What's wrong?  Are you that threatened by Madonna's talent that you have to try to sabotage her career? (Not that it will work)  Or maybe you just don't have any real confidence in Mariah's talents that is why you need to constantly trash other artists.   <br /> <br />The fact is I used to be a big fan of both Mariah and Madonna. But where Madonna is a true talent, someone innovative and unique who is not a afraid to take chances (what a real artist is all about) Mariah is predictable and her music is commercial crap.  And her talent (or lack of) is obvious now.  I bought The Emancipation of Mimi when it first came out because i liked It's Like that and had hope for this cd after her last two sucked.  But the only good songs on it were It's Like That, We Belong Together, Stay the Night and Mine Again.  The rest are generic crap and after listening to it a couple of times i have now tossed it aside in my cd pile where it has been collecting dust ever since.  Her voice used to be beautiful, full of soul and passion.  Check out Vision Of Love and Emotions, and compare that to anything she has done recently.  But now she has lost her voice.  She goes from a faint whisper to a shriek like she is trying too hard to prove something.  The point is that she isn't the talent she used to be.  Her song writing is a joke now too.  What happened to songs like Make it Happen, Hero, Anytime You need a Friend and Butterfly?  These were real songs with real messages and meaning in them.  Now we get songs with references to Bacardi, Louis Vuitton and her Benz and all the money she makes.  Why?  Because Mariahis shallow and so is her music.  She can't write anymore..apparently she and Jermaine Dupri have hit the marajuana one too many times.  <br /> <br />So why the re-release? <br /> <br />So she can suck more money out of her fans who will buy anything.  And because she knows her music isn't that good anymore. That is why she basically re-recorded We Belong Together as Don't Forget about Us and released it as a single instead of releasing one of the other songs as a single and saving these \\"new\\" songs for a remix album or ep .  Shake It Off was generic r+b that anyone could've released from Ashanti to Ciara.  Nothing special about it.  The only reason it did so well is because it was released immediately after the success of We Belong Together and because American radio is tired, playing nothing but the same generic hip hop and r+b crap over and over again. Unlike other countries around the world where all types of music are promoted and appreciated.   <br /> <br />Mariah does not care about her fans..she refers to you as lambs...how degrading is that?  But what do you expect from someone who is so full of herself.  Whose ego now heavily outweighs her talent.   I saw her on Ellen's talkshow yesterday.  She acted like she was so much better than everyone else, prancing out looking like a slut in clothes that were too tight for her and her face looking chubby and puffy.   <br /> <br />I refuse to buy the same cd over again when i didn't like it that much the first time around. Especially to support a woman who is arrogant and whose ego is now as big as her silicone implants.  So if you pathetic lambs want to post bad reviews for Madonna go ahead.  People are going to buy what they want based on their own tastes anyway. Not because some stupid 10 year old keeps posting bad reviews over and over again. If you want to write a real review for Madonna, at least listen to her music first and make a real judgement based on that. And when you are doing that i will be listening to Confessions on a Dance Floor..which after only being released four days ago I have listened to many more times than Mariah's boring lastest release.   LONG LIVE THE REAL QUEEN OF POP AND DANCE MUSIC....MADONNA!!!!    <br />
B0000027F8|5.0|In 1990, George Michael had released his second album entitled, LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE VOLUME 1. This album is not what FAITH turned out to be, for this album, still taking up George's sound of Pop/R&B, sheds George of his FAITH skin. This is a great album that DOES cover the concept of what is going on the world. <br /> <br />PRAYING FOR TIME  <br />The first single from the album. This song is beyond amazing. It is definitely one of the best songs on this album. It seems to focus on the way we all struggle to survive in the world of today. I think he's trying to point out that making money these days is not all hunky dory. If listen closely to just the music, it'll sound like something John Lennon would compose.  <br /> <br />FREEDOM 90  <br />The second single from the album. No, this is not a re-recorded rendition of the classic hit he had with WHAM! The hit he had with WHAM! was an dance type love song, while this song is just about George throwing away his \\"Faith\\" days and shedding new skin. The music video that went along with this single is definitely my favorite George Michael music video. George does not appear in the video, but five sexy supermodels do appear. Those five models are: \\"Linda Evangelista\\", the beautiful, innocent-looking short-haired blonde, wearing only the turtleneck sweater, \\"Naomi Campbell\\", the foxy African-American Brit, who dances around, wearing a bikini and headphones, \\"Christy Turlington\\", the doe-eyed brunette who walks straight down the living room hall, wrapped around in a bed sheet, \\"Cindy Crawford\\", the sexy brunette, who relaxes, while taking a bath, & \\"Tatjana Patitz\\", the seductive German Blonde, who stands up against a wall, smoking a cigarette.  <br /> <br />THEY WON'T GO WHEN I GO  <br />This song was originally recorded back in 1974 by Stevie Wonder. I have never heard Stevie Wonder's version and I do not care to hear it because I do not like Stevie Wonder or his pathetic music. But when I heard George's rendition, Iimmediately flipped over it. He sings it so smooth and he sings it with heart.  <br /> <br />SOMETHING TO SAVE  <br />The acoustic guitar really brings out the sound of this song's music. Not a bad song.  <br /> <br />COWBOYS AND ANGELS  <br />The fifth & final single from the album. This is an amazing song that seems to focus on two different people who have seemed to found each other and seemed to have found love for each other. Definitely a beautiful song.  <br /> <br />Medley: WAITING FOR THAT DAY/YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT  <br />The third single from the album. Usually, medlies are performed live in concert and live promotional performances, but George decided to record a studio medley. This song was more impressive than I had expected. \\"Waiting For That Day\\" is also about George shedding his skin from his \\"Faith\\" album and coming into another era. Definitely a great song(s).  <br /> <br />MOTHERS PRIDE  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />HEAL THE PAIN  <br />The fourth single from the album. I cannot go without listening to this song. This one is absolutely amazing. The acoustic guitar is incredible. The harmonies are amazing. George's voice is, as usual, outstanding. Definitely a song not to miss.  <br /> <br />SOUL FREE  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />WAITING (Reprise)  <br />This song brings this album to an end and is a reprise of the \\"Waiting For That Day/You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" medley. This version is even better, especially in sounding more mellow and more subtle, with George's voice sound very smooth and soothing. A song no fan should skip.  <br /> <br />Before I got this album, I was expecting only two or three songs to be worth listening to, since I considered FAITH to be George's best album. But after listening to the entire album, I was shocked to hear how incredible this album was. FAITH, to me, still stands as his best album, but LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE VOLUME 1 is one step behind FAITH. This album is definitely worth the time and money.
B000002UAU|5.0|I understand that somebody may think this album is boring, but that's a little bit like saying that the T Fords are silly cars, that modern cars are much better. This album changed everything in music, and for some reasons people still lovet it so much. My little nephew who is five years old just loves Beatles, and nobody told him that this is the most famous album ever. (When I asked him what he liked the most, he told me that's \\"she loves you yeah, yeah, yeah\\", not from this album, but the most famous hit ever, in 1963. That's so funny.
B00000DHRX|5.0|In 1998, after his \\"Bathroom Escapade\\", George Michael released his fourth album entitled, LADIES & GENTLEMEN: THE BEST OF GEROGE MICHAEL, a double-disc greatest hits compilation that gives every bit of the best of George Michael. <br /> <br />Disc 1: FOR THE HEART <br /> <br />JESUS TO A CHILD  <br />From the album OLDER (1996). George is always known for recording beautiful ballads, but we had no idea. This song is among the many beautiful ballads recorded by George and it is one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />FATHER FIGURE  <br />From the album FAITH (1987). Another heartfelt ballad that only George could have come up with and recorded. This song still remains as one of George's best.  <br /> <br />CARELESS WHISPER (Single Version)  <br />Performed by WHAM! Extended version from WHAM!'s album Make It Big (1984). Beautiful song. A classic.  <br /> <br />DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME (Live) (Duet with Elton John) <br />From the single DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME (1992). This song was originally recorded by just Elton John. Now, I hate Elton John with a passion. When first heard George's live version, I began to warm up to the song, but until I heard Elton John come out and turn the live performance into a duet, I was disappointed.  <br /> <br />YOU HAVE BEEN LOVED  <br />From the album OLDER (1996). Not a bad song.  <br /> <br />KISSING A FOOL  <br />From the album FAITH (1987). This song most definitely deserves this spot on this album. It is definitely a greatest hit and is one of my favorite songs from George.  <br /> <br />I CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME  <br />Previously unreleased. Not all that bad.  <br /> <br />HEAL THE PAIN  <br />From the album LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE VOLUME 1 (1990). Another favorite song of mine. I could listen to this one for an entire day if I had to.  <br /> <br />A MOMENT WITH YOU  <br />Previously released on an AIDS Tribute Album. Not bad.  <br /> <br />DESAFINADO (Duet with Astrud Gilberto) <br />This one could have been a lot better if it was sung in English.  <br /> <br />COWBOYS AND ANGELS  <br />From the album LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE VOLUME 1 (1990). This is one hell of a song. Definitely one of the most heartfelt ballads George has recorded.  <br /> <br />PRAYING FOR TIME  <br />From the album LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE VOLUME 1 (1990). I bought this album a year ago when I was in Florida for two weeks. That was the first time I heard this song and all I remember doing was starting this song over to hear it again.  <br /> <br />ONE MORE TRY  <br />From the album FAITH (1987). I will always favor this song because it was the song that made me the loyal fan that I am. I still remember my reaction to when I first heard it, only a year ago.  <br /> <br />A DIFFERENT CORNER  <br />Performed by WHAM! Original version from WHAM!'s album MUSIC FROM THE EDGE OF HEAVEN (1986). This was the only single that was recorded by WHAM!, but released as a single by only George. I absolutely love the high note he belts out in this one.  <br /> <br />Disc 2: FOR THE FEET <br /> <br />OUTSIDE  <br />New song. The first & only single from the album. This song is one of the best songs to dance to. The music video actually pokes fun at George's bathroom escapade.  <br /> <br />FASTLOVE  <br />From the album OLDER (1996). Definitely the perfect song to dance to.  <br /> <br />TOO FUNKY  <br />Released as a single back in 1992. I do not know what album this single came from, but I do know that this album is the first George Michael album for this song to appear on. I now understand why he titled this song, \\"Too Funky\\". The song is too funky, which is why I always make sure to listen to it.  <br /> <br />FREEDOM 90  <br />From the album LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE VOLUME 1 (1990). This is another one of my all-time favorite songs from George Michael.  <br /> <br />STAR PEOPLE 97  <br />Original version from the album OLDER (1996). No different from the original version, but still not bad.  <br /> <br />Medley: KILLER/PAPA WAS A ROLLIN' STONE (Live)  <br />From George Michael & Queen's album Five Live (1993). Not bad.  <br /> <br />I WANT YOUR SEX (Part 2)  <br />From the album Faith (1987). I do not know why this version was included here because it was \\"I Want Your Sex (Part 1)\\" that was released as a single. All in all, this is an okay version.  <br /> <br />MONKEY (Video & Single Version)  <br />Original version from the album FAITH (1987). Whether it is the album version or this version, I still cannot get enough of this song. This is an incredible song.  <br /> <br />SPINNING THE WHEEL  <br />From the album OLDER (1996). You gotta love this one. The sound is absolutely incredible.  <br /> <br />Medley: WAITING FOR THAT DAY/YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT  <br />From the album Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 (1990). Another one of the greatest songs from George Michael.  <br /> <br />I KNEW YOU WERE WAITING (FOR ME) (Duet with Aretha Franklin) <br />From Aretha Franklin's album ARETHA (1986). First off, this album is the first George Michael album for this song to appear. This duet was released as a single in 1987 and marks the first start of George's solo career, and it was to be George Michael's first #1 hit. This is a great duet. Love this song. <br /> <br />HARD DAY  <br />From the album FAITH (1987). This song was never released as a single, despite the fact that it makes an appearance on this album. I am still puzzling over why this was included on this album when it was never released as a single.  <br /> <br />FAITH  <br />From the album FAITH (1987). We all know how much of a classic this song is. No matter how old you are, no matter if you are a fan or not, you will find yourself singing along with this song.  <br /> <br />SOMEBODY TO LOVE (Live) (Duet with Queen) <br />From George Michael & Queen's album Five Live (1993). George Michael and Queen did record an album together, but it is actually an album that was recorded live from their 1992 Tribute concert for the late Freddie Mercury, who fronted Queen. This version blows Queen's original out of the water. It was <br /> <br />Ladies & Gentlemen, this is the best of George Michael. So buy a copy for yourselves now. You won't regret it.
B000BGH22W|3.0|I am a real Harry Potter fan, and I loved the first three soundtracks, especially \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\", which I have listened to repeatedly in recent weeks leading up to the release of \\"Goblet of Fire\\". I was nervous to hear that John Williams wasn't scoring the film, and my fears have been realized. I recieved my CD today, November 18, and listened to it twice before going to see the film this evening. It is true that a good soundtrack should set the mood of a film without being obtrusive, and \\"Goblet\\" succeeds in this, but it doesn't leave any lasting impression. It's just not what I hoped for. Yes, there are some good moments such as \\"The Foreign Visitors Arrive\\", and \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\", but overall it just didn't rise to the level of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\", \\"Double Trouble\\", or just about the whole \\"Prisoner\\" CD. And I didn't like the last three tracks at all, though the words to \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" were amusing. John Williams, please come back for the last three films! It's just not the same without your inspired themes.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|In November of 2005, Madonna released her sixteenth album entitled, CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR. Madonna did return to her natural roots of dance music, but Madonna went futuristic disco. This album is by far one of Madonna's ultimate albums. How Madonna just keeps getting better and better with the release of each album is just beyond me.    HUNG UP    The first single from the album. This song is the lead-off single for the album and it is the only song that features an original 70s disco sound. The reason for its original 70s disco sound was the fact that Madonna had sampled the music to \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\\". This is a killer tune and a perfect song to dance to. If you listen to the first verse very carefully, you'll notice that the first two lines were taken from Madonna's duet with Prince, \\"Love Song\\". The first two lines read, \\"Time goes by so slowly for those who wait, no time to hesitate. Those who run seem to have all the fun, I'm caught up, I'm hanging up on you\\".    GET TOGETHER    The third single from the album. The song's music video proves that Madonna is still a dazzler with her music videos. If you listen closely to the music, you'll be able to pick out the fact that this song is a reminiscent of Madonna's 1983 hit single, \\"Holiday\\".    SORRY    The second single from the album. Great tune here. It has been said that Madonna had sampled the baseline from The Jacksons' hit, \\"Can You Feel It\\". Sounds like the baseline to this song matches up with the baseline to \\"Can You Feel It\\".    FUTURE LOVERS    Great song here, that features a slight sample of Donna Summer's 1977 hit single, \\"I Feel Love\\". Here's a twist for all Madonna fans who do not know of this yet: Madonna, on her CONFESSIONS TOUR performs this song as the tour's opener, where she even sings a few lines from \\"I Feel Love\\".    I LOVE NEW YORK    A great dance tune, and a great homage to the city Madonna had first moved to after she left her homestate of Michigan.    LET IT WILL BE    Another great dance tune. The music to this song sounds like a reminiscent of Madonna's 1986 hit single, \\"Papa Don't Preach\\".    FORBIDDEN LOVE    This track is my favorite off of this album. Now, back in 1994, Madonna already had a song entitled, \\"Forbidden Love\\", which appeared on her 1994 album, BEDTIME STORIES (the song appeared again on Madonna's 1995 album SOMETHING TO REMEMBER). You would think from reading the title on this album that Madonna had either remixed the song or re-recorded the song, but she didn't. Madonna, pladgerized her own song title. This song is about how Madonna has met a man, who is very charming and very intriguing. Madonna is hooked to this guy, but she has to know if their love is forbidden. If you listen to the first and second verses, there is a line that is similar to a lyric in Madonna's 1987 hit single, \\"La Isla Bonita\\". Here are both lines: \\"...Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl\\" (\\"La Isla Bonita\\")...\\"...Once upon a time, there was a boy and there was a girl...\\" (\\"Forbidden Love\\").    JUMP    The fourth single from the album. This is another great dance tune with so much hype in it. There is a line here that is very similar to a lyric from Madonna's 1990 hit single, \\"Keep It Together\\". Here is the line from this song: \\"...We've learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me. The only thing you can depend on is your family...\\" You'll also notice that this song is the theme tune to the 2006 film, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA.    HOW HIGH    A great song that mentions to of Madonna's past-tunes: \\"Was it all worth it? And how did I earn it? NOBODY'S PEFECT, I guess I DESERVE IT\\". Both of those titles are songs from Madonna's 2000 album, MUSIC.    ISAAC    This is the song that all the Jewish Rabbis were complaining about. Those Jewish Rabbis should have not complained about the song because I think it's a great song, and it sounds like an uptempo dance version of her 1998 hit single, \\"Frozen\\".PUSH    This is not one of my favorites from the album. But I like the fact that Madonna has dedicated this to her husband, Guy Ritchie. This is the second song Madonna has recorded for Guy, the first being \\"I Deserve It\\".    LIKE IT OR NOT    This is another one of my favorites from the album. It explains how people are always pointing their fingers at Madonna, where Madonna says that, \\"...This is who I am, you can like it or not. You can love me or leave me, but I'm never gonna stop...\\". Either you love her or you hate her, but do not, I repeat, DO NOT DISRESPECT MADONNA.        This album is definitely a masterpiece, even for Madonna, who has created so many masterpieces since that of 1983. This is an album for all Madonna fans. Do not listen to any of the Mariah Carey fans. Mariah's fan are just as stuck up as Mariah Carey, herself, is. Mariah is a little ho.
B000001FT2|5.0|I had no idea who Grace Jones was until I saw her perform on the Pee-Wee's Playhouse Christmas Special (1988). I obtained a few of her songs (legally, of course) and went from there. Grace Jones has a very original style that I've never seen in any artist before. From her androgynous appearance, pouting lips, and French lyrics, you can't go wrong with Grace Jones. She is quite possibly one of the most underrated artists of her time. My top favorite songs on this album include Walking in the Rain, Use Me, I've Seen that Face Before, and Pull Up to the Bumper. Walking in the Rain is an artistic, dark, and haunting melody. In fact, it's the most played song on my MP3 player. If you're tired of ordinary musicians give Grace Jones a try. Warm Leatherette is another classic album. What more can I say? She's brilliant. I'm hoping she will return to the music scene very soon.
B000005ALN|5.0|In 1996, George Michael released his long, long-awaited third album entitled, OLDER. This album is more different than that of his first two albums, where this album features a great deal of songs composed in a mature mixture of Jazz and R&B. In some ways, the album did not do well, but in my opinion, the album should have because it shows that George has enough talent to reinvent his sound. His image had also been reinvented, where he went with a shorter hairstyle that was a dark brunette, instead of a dirty blonde.. He left behind his five o'clock shadow and went with a matching hair color goatee.  <br /> <br />JESUS TO A CHILD  <br />The first single from the album. Definitely one of the most moving ballads George has ever recorded. Everytime I hear this song, my heart is touched from this heartfelt ballad that features George singing in his most soothing and relaxing sound ever.  <br /> <br />FASTLOVE  <br />The second single from the album. I really dug this song the first time I heard it and I still love it today. The video is nothing short of amazing and words cannot describe it.  <br /> <br />OLDER  <br />The fourth single from the album, as well as the album's title track. This song is quite impressive, but it is not quite I had expected. But all in all, it is still a great song.  <br /> <br />SPINNING THE WHEEL  <br />The third single from the album. I was not expecting too much out of this song, but I was wrong. This song is definitely amazing in every way. This is a song that I will continue to play over and over again.  <br /> <br />IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER  <br />Not a bad song.  <br /> <br />THE STRANGEST THING  <br />Whenever I put this album on, this is the first song I listen to. It sounds very strange, I mean, very, very strange, but it is very catchy and I was immediately hooked when I heard the first minute of it.  <br /> <br />TO BE FORGIVEN  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />MOVE ON  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />STAR PEOPLE  <br />\\"Star People 97\\":The fifth single from the album. Both the album version and the single version are outstanding.  <br /> <br />YOU HAVE BEEN LOVED  <br />The sixth & final single from the album. Not quite what I had expected, but not all that bad.  <br /> <br />This is an album that is classified as another amazing album. It is definitely one of my favorites and will always be a favorite. I know a lot of you do not have this album, so get out and buy a copy for yourselves.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|This set has subtitles in English, French, Spanish. The audio can only be choosen from English and Spanish. <br />I haven't get a chance to really enjoy it since I got it. The first impression of it is good looking but not sturdy. I won't lend it out if I want to keep it in good shape.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I used this product for two weeks, through one battery recharge, and it no longer works. I used it for quick crumb and dust pick up, never thinking it would replace my vacuum. I paid $30.00 for it at Home Depot. I hope I will be able to return it. The customer service department of the company that markets this is difficult to reach.  I do not think anyone works there! DO NOT BUY THIS.
0440238609|5.0|One has to admire the wonderous way Pullman winds this tale. One of the things I enjoyed most about H.D.M. is the way he constructs the rules of his multiverse. The way everything fits together is very believable(so much so, that at times you wonder if HDM is really a SciFi story pretending to be fantasy). The way each book succesivly expands both the world and the story in flawless smoothness, makes these books very hard to put down. <br />Pullman's overall themes were well thought out, and I particularly enjoyed his innuendos about the nature of religion, and christianity in particular. Its disheartening to see so many people use this detail as an excuse to bash the trilogy. Its one of the trilogy's best points. <br />If I aspired to emmulate any author, it would be Philip Pullman. I can only hope that HDM will be followed by even better works of literary art.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ignore Ray Of Light, Music and the under-rated American Life. This is the return to form for Madonna we've wanted since ''Like A Prayer''. <br /> <br />Beneath the staccato blips and sonic soundscapes of the future disco, she kops a feel for ABBA, Moroder and Donna Summer; all while confessing on her dancefloor.  <br /> <br />She successfully melds the spirit and candor of 1986's 'Into The Groove' with sounds from the modern future yet, incorporates themes decades old as well. Take Forbiddlen Love, which slyly incorporates the backbeat to her own 'Holiday'. On 'I Love N.Y', She sounds as happy to be in the music and in the light as she was when she launched her sound with 'Everybody' over 2 decades ago, or 'Like It Or Not, a tricked out souped up pony to a shadow of what resembles 'Fever'.  <br /> <br />The sounds found within COADF is nearly 'every' Madonna era, rolled into all things. Yet, for all of it's sheer bravado, it works; and it works splendidly with reckless abandon.  <br /> <br />This is uncannily best release in years. Now, forget Kaballah modern Madonna. If you've wanted the spirit and the sound of the now and the spirit of Madonna in the 80's, here's your chance. Now, get into the groove!
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|just like all of adam sandler's movies, this is an instant classic comedy!  the laughes come right off the bat,  no boring beginnings here.  i will admit though, that the middle did drag a bit when they were practicing.  but they did stick in a few laughes and made it worth while.
074325144X|5.0|This book changed the way I run and my outlook on life.  I have a more positive attitude and feel more balanced in everything I do.  The simple pre-running exercises take very little time and are excellent for running or any stressful activity.  Also, I do not consider a run finished without doing my leg raises.  I recommend this book for anyone who runs.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I was a little sceptical when I heard Madonna was coming out with a new CD after the dissapointment that was \\"American Life\\". But I was still excited. The first single \\"Hung Up\\" was not what I expected, I couldn't believe she had reduced herself to singing over Abba's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\", but I have to admit it grew on me- I couldn't get that hook out of my head (\\"Time goes by so slowly\\"). Now it's one of my favorites. I think my all time favorite song off this album is \\"Get Together\\" this is pure disco-with its moving and spiritual sounding intro reminiscent of Thelma Houston's \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" and Madonna's clever working of the SOS Band's \\"Take Your Time Do It Right\\" into the first verse. I can't sayenough good things about this song! This is definitely a club hit! Especially in Europe! Next is \\"Sorry\\" which sounds like something off of \\"Ray of Light\\" with its techno drive, another favorite. I don't really like \\"Future Lovers\\" and I can't stand \\"I Love New York\\" I'm sorry I love Madonna with all my heart but here she sounds like a Third Grader trying to write a poem for school, that's just poor writing at its worst, but it has a good beat. The other good ones are \\"Jump\\", \\"How High\\"- and I have to spend a minute on \\"Issac\\"- this is obviously the song that there was some controversy over I think it's about someone associated with the Kabalah faith- I don't know much about it, but this track is purely moving! I love how the sample mixed into the chorus-it's great! The lyrics are beautiful and the beat is perfect to dance to-it's deep! \\"Push\\" and \\"Like It Or Not\\" are good tracks also. In conclusion- buy it. Don't ask anymore questions- just buy it! This is a must-have for all dyed-in-the-wool Madonna fans. I just have one thing to say to her- a well earned \\"You go girl!\\"
0446677450|5.0|If youare tired of the rat race. Tired of unappreciative employers. Tired of paying too much in taxes. Tired of having too much month left at the end of your money, then buy, read and use the philosophy disclosed in Rich Dad Poor Dad. You'll be glad you did!
B00004VVND|3.0|What's uneven about it? Well, let's see. The robots talk for a while in in full sentences then all they can say is \\"draw\\". The gun Yul Brynner uses suddenly has a light on it blinking words. Ridiculous! The visitors would see this on his gun and shatter the old western illusion. And there is a little luck in addition to many, many uneven elements. When Brynner goes after Benjamin it was just luck a robot horse was around for Brynner to hop on and pursue as <br />he'd have a hard time pursuing the also robot-horse riding Benjamin <br />if Brynner had to walk.In spite <br />of many problems the film is still very genius. Music score, excellent way it is filmed and acted and all the great action and imagination. Still a winner.
B000B8QF14|5.0|Personally, I think Bullet In A Bible was done well. Sam Bayer did a great job in shooting the concert, capturing some magical up-close shots, making a viewer feel as if they were on the stage with the band. I liked the interviews as well. There were some bits that I had a problem with, thus making it a 4 star rating. Sometimes, all of the jumbled angles, like zooming to Billie Joe's eye, then back, was hard to keep up with. Having some parts in black and white didn't really work for me. I know it was supposed to add an effect, but I felt all color would've been better. I really enjoyed seeing the behind the scenes look at Green Day. There were really hilarious parts (the Tre Cool Montage and Billie Joe doing a really funny Rocky impersonation), and really beautiful moments, like Mike calling Tre a little catalyst, and many others. I felt there was an equal and balanced portrayal of humor and seriousness. It worked. We got to see Green Day in a different light. I was upset that the FULL concert wasn't on the DVD/CD. They cut songs such as Homecoming, She, Maria, Jaded, and perhaps one of the most important events during recent Green Day shows, calling up three audience members to form a band and play Operation Ivy's Knowledge. I've been to two Green Day shows, and this part of the show is really exciting and interesting. It should've been included. Also, some speaking Billie Joe incorporated in between songs weren't on the CD, like the moaning bit during Hitchin' A Ride, and introducing all of the musicians, giving a humorous summary of each member. The length of the DVD wasn't disappointing. I had read a review somewhere that it was only 115 minutes, but it's over two hours. All in all, I'd say any Green Day fan should get this amazing CD/DVD package. Plus, the price isn't that bad, considering. I say, go for it!
0375757422|5.0|Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, \\"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\" The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans!
B00003CXAW|5.0|One of the greatest movie monsters has finally arrived on DVD. Master showman Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) leads an expedition to a remote tropical island and discovers a 30 foot tall gorilla that falls for his new female star Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). The expedition manages to bring the colossal beast back to New York City for exhibition but it escapes to terrorize the city. After 70 years, \\"King Kong\\" still remains as one of the most entertaining movies in cinema history. This classic film features a well paced story, rousing action sequences, a good music score and a great finish. Special effects technician Willis O'Brien was an important part in the development of \\"King Kong\\" and changed moviemaking with his ingenious stop motion animation. The scene of Kong facing the airplanes on top of the Empire State Building is a memorable Hollywood moment. Director Merian C. Cooper and producer Ernest B. Schoedsack have small cameos as the flight commander and gunner of the airplane that attacks Kong. The breakthrough hit inspired numerous filmmakers and effects technicians.<br /><br />If you were expecting a simple DVD for this landmark classic, then get ready to experience \\"King Kong\\" Special Edition. The classic film is presented in its original full screen format. The DVD contains a terrific black and white video transfer and a well balanced 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. This 2-Disc DVD features an audio commentary by cast members and effect artists Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston, an extended \\"The Making of Kong\\" documentary, several special effects featurettes, theatrical trailers and eye-catching interactive menus. Overall, \\"King Kong\\" scores a winning \\"A\\".
B000001DTM|5.0|I wasn't a fan of U2 in the 1980's. I thought their songs sounded too much like army marching songs, e.g. Pride in the Name of Love, Sunday Bloody Sunday, etc. I was so turned off to the band's sound that I wasn't willing to listen to anything new from them. One night my husband played \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" for me and that was when I started to realize that this band could be more than a formula 80's band. When Achtung Baby came out my husband begged me to listen to it. He told me it was nothing like U2 of the 80's. When I heard it I simply could not believe my ears. How could this possibly be the same band? I loved this album the first time I heard it and I find myself going back to it for a listen every few months. It more than holds up. It made me a U2 believer and fan. After this masterpiece I've bought every album U2 has put out and although none since have been as compelling from start to finish, they do not disappoint. <br /> <br />I can scarcely believe I'd ever write a review in favor of a U2 album. I really could not stand this band in the 80's (Bono's mullet et al). But U2 is the most talented rock band of its time and this album proves it -- even to nonbelievers like me.
B000B8QF14|4.0|In 1994, 3 punks from the bay released an album titled \\"Dookie\\". It was highly succesful and featured many, now classic, song's. However, the band's popularity would soon decrease as the general public looked for something new. Throughout the \\"decline\\", the band continued to make records and stayed on the road proving time and time again that they had one of the best live shows in rock. <br /> <br />Fast forward to 2004. The band releases \\"American Idiot\\" to critical acclaim and a new mania is created. There's no escaping the band or the single's...they're everywhere. In 2005, they embarked on an international tour in support of the album. One of the stops; two legendary nights at the UK's Milton Keynes Bowl. \\"Legendary?\\" you ask. Yes, legendary. First of all, the band may have matured a bit, but they still have their punk roots and know where they came from. The Milton Keynes National Bowl is a big venue...and this band was able to fill it, both nights. What other punk band could do that? <br /> <br />The peformances were excellent and propelled Green Day, in my opinion, to legendary status. This CD and DVD set chronicles the band's second night at the bowl. The DVD is done in a documentary style. Inbetween song's, you get backstage footage and interviews with the member's. These are interesting segments that DO NOT slow down the momentum of the show. Infact, my initial reaction to them was that they slowed down the show's momentum but then I realized...this is a concert film. It's not just a concert. It's meant to show you were the band is at this point in their career through both live performances and views & opinions. View it as a film, not as a concert. You may say \\"But it would have been good if all the songs just flowed as a concert\\". Well, that's your opinion and it's not what was released. You have to take this for what it is and enjoy it.  <br /> <br />Some song's have been cut for whatever reason (The DVD could have held more song's and the CD could havecontained 2 or 3 more songs) but again, take it for what it is. It's a document, folks. The song's are great and the sound quality (and picture quality on the DVD) is excellent. The song's are performed with amazing energy and the crowd is enthusiastic throughout the entire show. <br /> <br />Now, it is not without it's flaws. As I mentioned, more song's could have been added. I also feel that the DVD could have contained some bonus features to make this the ultimate \\"American Idiot Era\\" package (perhaps the single's music videos, more interviews, etc...) but thats just nitpicking really. <br /> <br />So, in summary, take this for what it is. It's a document of Green Day at this point in their career. The 3 punks from the bay have certainly come a long way (there's a rhyme for you). Pop some popcorn, put this sucker on and be blown away by the new kings of rock.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|If you enjoy Madonna you will love this collection.  It is clearly Madonna returning to what made her the most successful and most influential Dance/Pop female singer.  The entire production is pure fun.  Catchy up beat dance beats.  Premixed for your dancing and partying pleasure.  Some silly some comical some serious lyrics but all danceable.  The heavy sampling is enjoyable and a nod to historical dance floor favorites. The departure from heavy spirituality and religous themes is truly refreshing. I love this collection.  I can't get enough of it.
B000000OQF|5.0|In 1987, the small LA club band Guns N' Roses, released their debut, titled Appetite For Destruction. Rock N' Roll wasn't at its best in that time; poppy-comercial crap ruled all around the world. Until the day AFD was released. To put it simply, Axl and company kicked a** of all those who said rock is dead - and proved it is not. This is what changed the world in the late 80s.    So what's so great about this music and that band? Isn't it just another rock n' roll stuff we had through the years? Well, the fact is - that Guns N' Roses were the last true Rock N' Roll band - You may argue, but this is unfortunately true. Rock N' Roll best years, the 70s were gone, the 90s were full of cheap commercial pop and alternative bands, and nowadays... let's not even talk about it. It was Guns N' Roses who played true, inspiring, Rock N' Roll at their time. There wasn't anyone like Them when They disappeared.    Back to the record - It is piece of raw, trash, wild, rough, raunch hard rock - and You can't help but love it. The opening riffs of Welcome To The Jungle set You right in there; It's So Easy make You even hotter - Slash kicks off with his dire guitar licks on Nighttrain; etc, etc... The others are great, too - like the major GN'R hit Sweet Child O' Mine with awesome riff at the beginning - just a really sweet, power ballad tune that always make You dreamy - and tear Your soul apart on Slash incredible solo. Anything Goes is another favourite - really cool one, very catchy - this song has got sexual innuendo and bluesy rawness that will surely please You. And the closing Rocket Queen, a masterpiece - Strong beat starts, and Duff comes in with bass riff... this song GOT THE POWER. Some stellar jammin' in the middle and the closing part, it's just excellent. Flawless.     Not to mention the others - Paradise City, another big hit, or dark rock-riffer My Michelle - This album is a joy from start to finish.    GN'R would release other excellent albums in the future, but Appetite For Destruction remains as essence of their classic sound and is favourite among most fans. Well, what can I say... just get this album and enter the Rock N' Roll heaven. Highly recommended.
B000AL730O|5.0|I have been a fan of Paul since the start of the Beatles.  The first time I listened to this album I thought it was OK, but not what I was used to.  I listened to it a few weeks later on my computer while at work, and started playing it over and over.  This is a very good album, if not the best Paul McCartney has done.  Every song is great, I can't listen to it enough.  It is a blast to the past of the White Album.  There is a sense of meaning to every song and Paul is at his best.  Thank you Paul McCartney.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|And I might add, the best SciFi movie made in many years. I thank Universal for letting Firely soar again. But, they really blew it on their marketing strategy (if you can call it that), so Serenity flew under most folk's radar when it hit theaters. If it had been advertised better, this movie would have made at least $200 mil. The DVD cover art fails to convey the plot- much like the cinema poster; but don't let that fool you. I highly, highly reccomend this flick. Pop a double batch of popcorn, sit back and watch two hours go by like 10 minutes. With plenty of shoot-em-up, kick-butt action; humor, sadness, and some scariness- Joss really delivers!
B000B5IPLK|5.0|<br />  Is their one? From Aretha Franklin to her god daughter Whitney Houston....and up till now is their one? The answer to that question is yes there is!!! Truly her name is Alicia Keys. I love her style, the way she carries herself (as a lady-and not a harlot). Yeah I said it. Now days female artist usually are about nothing except undressing (and can't sing ). But as I said earlier is there one? And once again.......yep!!  <br /> <br />   This album is awesome. She is awesome. She truly sings from the heart. It reminds me every one seems to have an anthem or a song they have recorded which is a must at any of their concerts. For her she says so herself on track # 8 that song is \\"If I ain't got You\\". I am confident that Ms. Alicia will continue to strive for excellence with not just her talent but her gift. And because she began this project with a prayer there is no doubt that she will continue to accelerate to higher heights. <br />  <br />   If you ain't got this one. Get it!!!!  <br /> <br />   Written by: Demetrius A. Otey <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|I just stumbled upon Radiohead, after hearing that they were \\"amazing\\" from a friend.  I, out of the blue, decided to give OK Computer a try, and since then, my musical life has changed.  Ok Computer is probably the most beautiful album I have ever heard.  The vocals are incredible, even though they may seem drawn-out and tired-sounding. OK Computer has many layers thoughout, not to mention quick changes in the tempo.  I am not really sure what the overall message of this album is, but I do know that it is one to check out.  You won't wanna miss out on this delicate listening experience.
B00005JOGU|3.0|This was not an easy movie to watch.  It shows the length a writer will go to, using conniving promises and deceit for his own benefit.  This was one of the first books I read to the very end in the late Sixties.  It was in such detail that it was hard to visualize how strangers could do such a thing to an ordinary family.  It took place in November, 1959, in Kansas and made the news even in New York City.    This thoroughly corrupt magazine writer took the train all the way to Kansas to research for an article.  He had no restraints in his intrusion on the privacy of the dead, opening the hardwood caskets and describing how the victims appeared and the clothes they wore in death for a closed casket funeral.  He spent three months there attending the trial, then returned to New York to talk, talk, talk about every little detail.  He said he was talking his head off.  He talked incessantly about the case and his attachment to Perry Smith, the triggerman with no conscience.    They had much in common.  Perry, whose mother was a Cherokee Indian, grew up in an orphanage.  Truman was deserted by his mother as a child and left with some aunts in Alabama.  He used his wiles to convince Perry that he will make him less than a monster in the book he plans to write.  Perry thinks Capote is a friend, but he continually lied to him about the book using cruelty to get his way.  \\"People remember first impressions\\" and \\"be careful what you do to get what you want.\\"    Capote's lover, Jack Dunphy, gave him an ultimatum to come to Spain where he will be writing his own book; he abandoned the murderers in prison out in Leavenworth for \\"love,\\" even though he admitted that he felt a kinship with Perry.    After three years with the book two-thirds finished, he had a public reading in a New York theater and received a standing ovation for his snooping in Kansas and his imaginative \\"non-fiction\\" novel.  He finally got his confession from Perry who told the details to clear his conscience, but it was just fodder for the book.  IN COLD BLOOD was built on tainted blood, of the deranged killers who were after money (found only $40-50 in the house), and Perry was the one who did the shootings.  By the execution date in April, 1965, Capote was a basket case but the inmates were cool and collected.  He cried crocodile tears as he was not a friend.  Another writer, Harper Lee, told him \\"the fact is you didn't want to save them.\\"  The book was published in 1966.    The dial telephones were a good touch as that is what we had back then.  In the apartment he shared in New York with Jack, the bed was an antique like Margaret Butler's.  Arby Lockhart looked like I did in 1965 as she portrayed the wife of the sheriff, who was also duped by Capote and had invited him into his own home for Christmas.  He was an unethical reporter and socialite where he drank too much.  He had been damaged because \\"people judge you by the way you talk.\\"  This movie brought the book to life better as it dwelt more on the actions of the writer and less on the murders.
B000B8QF00|4.0|I must admit that this album picks up some of Alanis' many 'greatest hits'. Yet, although the album is called the Collection, I was again dissapointed that there was not even a nod to Alanis' first two albums. The ommision of her early 90s pop single - \\"Too Hot\\" makes this album more a mix tape of singles rather than a true Anthology-type greatest hits album. <br /> <br />Mind you, there are many years to come along with many more great songs for Alanis to add to her canon. I can't wait to see a greatest hits cd 20 years down the line.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Personally I think this is the best Batman movie ever made. Yeah the car isn't what we all know it to be, but the action and the storyline is quite good. The antagonist is kind of unlike any other movie which is bizarre but at the same time interesting. This is because you actually see Batman with unpredictable struggles rather than not being able to kill his enemy the first time they fight.
0312979479|5.0|Wow. This book is definitly worth reading. I read this book in 7th grade and with a little help from Spark Notes, this book made complete sense. The suspense is deadly, and you literally can't put this book down! I read this book in one day, because I couldn't stand to stop reading it. It's not like one of those books where it takes chapters to actually become good- its good from the beginning! In this book, you'll find yourself making accusions of whom the murderer is! And the ending will SHOCK you. The only bad part about it is that it was written with many swear words, especially in the beginning. It also discusses some mature situations, such as drinking, murdering, and some brief violence. And also, there are 10 characters in this book to keep track of. That can be somewhat difficult, but at [...] they have a complete character list which hill help you tremendously! It alo has in-depth summaries for each charpter, along with other helpful information. But besides that, this book is good for all ages, about 12 and up!

B000000H57|5.0|October Rust, since the very first time I heard it has been one of my favourite albums. You can put it on any time and I find it just washes over you...in a good way of course. It's one of those strange albums, Cult of Luna's 'Reciever' being another, that is all at once heavy and almost chilled, haunting and uplifting...but whatever else it may be, start to finish it's amazing. <br />Tracks to look out for; Green Man, Wolf Moon, Love you to Death. <br />Nothing but respect for the Negative, and in my opinion it is their finest work.
0446577383|5.0|Great book. <br />It seems a bit amiss in the beginning begging the question, \\"How in the world will this ever get interesting?\\" <br />Well, hold on. This book builds to an incredible end and I consider it one of his best, if not the best. <br />The members of the Camel Club are a hoot and play a far bigger role that was originally anticipated to some extent. <br />Well worth your time and effort. <br />I do not want to disuss any of the nuances of the characters or the plot, go see for yourself.
B00005JNTX|2.0|This movie certainly has an allstar cast but I think the movie itself was too complicated. You have story segments here and there so if you watch this movie while doing something it is difficult to follow. I'm also not really a big fan of black and white movies because it doesn't draw my attention too well so I didn't really like this movie.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Madonna breaks McCartney Top 10 record  <br />Posted: 19 November 2005 - From Everyhit.com <br />Madonna has entered the singles chart at Number 1 with 'Hung Up.' In doing so, she has secured her 54th Top 10 hit and overtaken Paul McCartney - including his tally with The Beatles, Wings and various other guises. Though both artists trail somewhat behind Elvis' 76 and Cliff's 65 Top 10 hits, they are an elite group; no other artists have had 50 or more Top 10 hits. <br /> <br />Other significant Madonna chart facts.... <br /> <br />-Longest span of Number 1 singles for a female solo artist <br />-Most Top 40 hits for a female solo artist <br />-Most weeks spent on The Top 40 by a female solo artist <br />-Most number 1's by a female solo artist <br />-Female solo artist with most weeks at Number 1
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This album has both dance and electro moments which i wasn't expecting, but i am extremely happy with!!! ABBA sampled Hung Up starts off the show, and she takes us for a ride!! Awesome album. <br /> <br />The second track \\"Get Together\\" is a trance dream, and \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"How High\\" are three SPECTACULAR tracks which mix together superbly.
B000000OAA|5.0|From the opening carnival sounds on \\"Brighton Rock\\" to the last note of \\"In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited\\" this is the most amazing album I have ever heard. In between is the unmistakable classic \\"Killer Queen\\",and unbelievable list of other songs each with its own unique one of a kind style. I have been listening to this album for over 25 years and I like each and every song on it. \\"Now I'm Here\\" is one of live rocks greatest songs. If you have never heard \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" you are missing out, it is still the most exciting guitar ever. \\"Flick Of The Wrist\\" is an intoxicating tune with acidic lyrics and guitar wizardry, that is one of Queen's best. Also outstanding is \\"Tenement Funster\\" a great rocker courtesy of Roger Taylor.(May's guitar will take you to the moon on this one) Another outstanding song, and unique among Queen songs is \\"She Makes Me\\". I love the haunting vocal by Brian on this one. All of this is mixed in with some of Queen and Freddie Mercury's greatest ballads. A true classic from the worlds greatest rock band.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|the people here who keep giving madonna's new CD a star or ridiculous and childish reviews are coming from the organization called the LAMB. They (mostly mariah and gwen fans) are just afraid that Madonna will go on to the top next week to surpass other divas' figures of sales and just trying to bring madonna down desperately. Obviously they are dying to decrease the sales of Madonna's new cd by reviewing badly and making people believe what they say here.   simply ignore that folks, they are just brats and kids with no lives. Surely they are just insecure and fragile like the appearance of Mariah's butterfly video! fans assimilates their idols, huh??  they don't want to admit that madonna is still the Queen of Pop too!  Get this evidence,  you all mariah's criers!!!  Get a research and educate yourself with the facts OK??  Here it is!!    Sorry, mariah, you are not the biggest selling female artist of all time as your fans may label you!! for the record, in the US, Barbra and Madonna have sold more albums than you mariah! Madonna has more gold singles than you too!!   Ok now, what about outside of the US? Madonna still has sold more albums and signles than you!! Of course more No.1s and top ten hits all over the world too!! and what about concerts?? Has mariah ever topped the grossing of the concert tour since she debuted?? As far as i heard, her concert tour a few years ago got even cancelled because of low selling tickets. What about Madonna, if you may ask?? She has sold out her first US tour in 1985 and all of her world tours got sold out since then, even including the best grossing reinvention tour of the year 2004.   you want to talk about Mariah's No.1 songs?? It's totally overated as she featured so many artists in her no.1 songs!!   she can't figure herself out without rapping or singing-high-notes hunks!!   Of course DJs in the US overplayed her songs too!!   in the US, Madonna has more top two, five, ten, twenty, and forty singles without even featuringartists like mariah does.   Soley madonna on herself!!     Now what's your basis of claiming your little mess towards madonna and mariah's self-acclaimed wannabe queen status??     Mariah doesn't match madonna's influence in pop music, besides madonna's unprecedented success internationally since the Beatles and Elvis. period.   even all these evidences are against mariah too..   so would you mariah fans nicely stop the mess like little mimi, yes i have to call MISS mariah mimi now, got emancipated and read my review?     for the record before i begin the review, I heard Mariah's mimi-mess (she even thinks of herself as mimi, one of the barbies and as in a naked form - what a shame and an awful title as well) and it's 5 cent worth!!! and all the songs in that album were boring and had nothing to say (same old story).   We belong together? yuck, djs in the US simply overplayed it and it was overdone with her horrible falsedo!! shake it off?? she was trying to be Usher or something?? the rest of the album was just the same with tons of rappers' featuring.   very uncharacteristic!!!  she couldn't make an album without any rapping hunks, huh?? she just can't figure it out by herself!!! even the melody lines were too abstract and oversung and i think mariah lost her touch to generate more catchy songs!  She seems to be just a yelling and screaming R&B cracker on that cd.  My ears almost got burnt and burst!!!    But unlike her, madonna's songs on this album has a great and original quality in melody, shape, and catchy feelings.  this new CD has great vibes and all songs are well produced.  It's an all-around great cd!  It doesn't sound like anything out there in the States' markets.  If you expect anything of R&B, you have a wrong singer to listen to. It's madonna!  I care less for all this overplayed and overrated R&B cra- without any meanings out there.  This is new sound in a fresh manner.  Get the CD and into the groove.    I just can't stop listening to it because it's an addictive production that madonna and the producer created together.  Good job, Madonna and I expect you will pick up a few grammys next year.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|For some reason Mariah Carey will last on time for havin' the most beautiful Christmas album in 90's. The album has already 6 singles out and has perdured as long as this 10 years of existince. This album is better known for classic 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' the Mariah song that is already a really cheerful holiday classic. Also there are known Joy To The World, Oh Holy Night, Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town and the beautiful Christmas ballad Miss You Most (At Christmas Time). <br /> <br />This dual disc apart of bring you visual DVD material has 3 US Bonus Tracks: <br /> <br />All I Want For Christmas Is You (So So Def Remix featuring Lil' Bow Wow and Jermaine Dupree): This was a remix made on 2000 for Japanese market and was released on the Greatest Hits album. <br /> <br />Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town (J.D. Anniversary Mix) New vocals and R&B flave to this classic of classics. Funny and catchy, but i'd rather the original version. <br /> <br />God Rest Ye Merry Gentlement: This was first International bonus track and is already a classic. <br /> <br />This is a must-have to those who loved the record and spend the Holiday on Miss Carey style.

I'm an adult and I adored this book, but not everyone is like me. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for the 4-8 age range because bigger kids want stronger excitement, but I'm sure there are other BIG KIDS AT HEART, like me, who will enjoy it, no matter what their age. <br /> <br />One thing I know for sure, the enchanting art will appeal to everyone. <br /> <br />This book is a fun read with the cutest characters imaginable.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Finally! Madonna is back to her true dance roots and what beautiful bleach blond roots they are! 100% unapologetic club groove, Confessions On A Dance Floor is arguably Madonna's best album to date and showcases what made her a star in the first place, her ability to make booties shake. From the throbbing beats of the hit lead single Hung Up, to the take it or leave it attitude of Like It Or Not, Confessions is 12 tracks of pure beat. 5 Stars!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Honestly. Has Mariah Carey or \\"Mimi\\" ever NOT released a release of her albums. What a ploy to raise her sales and earn more money. The original was bad enough, but honestly, the new songs on this album are even worse. When you hear them you will understand why they didn't make the album originally. Now they decide to put them together and try to scrape up more sales... like always.  <br /> <br />Save your money because chances are she is going to be releasing the Super-D-Duper Ultimate Titanium x 10 version of the album in a few months.

Now that I have heard it and seen the video all I can do is humm \\"Every little thing...lalala\\"  all day.  Madonna continues to be a strong contender in pop music and I will continue to purchase her records.  This cd is one of her best. Every songs segues into the next so seamlessly.  I commend Stuart Price for his valued and highly danceable work.  Madonna you have done it again!!!!  Congratulations for always amazing me.
0553801503|5.0|Ok. I think that the general bashing of this book was mainly brought on by the fact that that yes it took just too damn long to get here. Five years. Then, it is finally here and everyone is pumped to jump back into this wonderful story, and it is a setup book. Worse, it is HALF a set up book. So now you have more of a letdown cause now you feel like you have to wait another year for the story that you at least thought you were getting when this damn book was finally printed. Am I disappointed, YES, but not because the book sucked, rather that I have to wait longer for another book that is going to be a continuation of this one, and it too likely will be a setup. I bet half his readers are afraid like Stephen King Fans were that he was going to die before the series was completed (Dark Tower). Well, that thought has crossed my mind too. <br /> <br />I thought this was a great book, for the content that was there. No there wasnt the whirlwind of action the Storm had, but again, the war is over presently and we have to set up the next Storm. I do HIGHLY recommend that this next book be released in six months to a year or everyone is going to lose interest, get too damn confused (so many characters and you cant exactly browse through the books b4 the next one comes out), and just give up. George, you are still my favorite author, I love your work, please just get this out in a timely fashion! I'm ready for the Dance.
B0007Y4USW|1.0|Why is it that almost every song on this album is featuring someone? If she was truly as talented as people claim she is she would be able to make an album nowadays that is all Mariah. Instead she calls for help from numerous rappers and thugs in order to boost sales. Its pretty pathetic... and this is the queen of pop? puh-lease. All her sales should be split in half because the people featured on her albums do half the work. Skip this album... it is boring, dull and plain bad.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|I gotta say, this it the first Madonna album i liked since Ray of Light, wich in my opinion is her best so far. <br /> <br />Anyway, I LOVE the tracks \\"HUNG UP\\" like some other reviwer said its catchy... worse: its infectious... then \\"PUSH\\" because of the deep base and the \\"like a prayer\\" chorus, \\"LIKE IT OR NOT\\" because of the attitude and melody.. it really flows well; and finally \\"LET IT WILL BE\\", it has nice nice backgrounds and kind of classical orchestra. <br /> <br />Its a must buy, i can almost predict hearing it playing non stop in every *hip* club.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is just another great album from the undisputed Queen of Pop. Perfect in almost every way. A great dance album that goes beyond most other dance albums of today... only Madonna can continually reinfuse a whole genre of music with such creativity.  Buy this album and some dancing shoes and have fun.

I mean, I feel the lyric writing isn't the best, but the riffs are GREAT, and don't quit! As a guitar player, this gives a me a...well, let's just say electric wood!  <br /> <br />The album strats off with 'Dance', a catchy chorus and killer flowing riffs. <br /> <br />I love the dual riffing of DeMartini/Crosby on the entire album, but this is one of my personal fave main riffs on 'One Good Lover', which is also the chorus riff. <br /> <br />Like a Drag race fom outer space, 'Drive Me Crazy' riffs like mad at fast tempo, slowing down with ultra heavy stop riffs, then back into quick action with Crosby whammy action...you can't stop this boy! <br /> <br />'Slip of the Lip' is sexy, groovy and killer. I always hafta rewind the main riff 'cause it's just that sick. <br /> <br />'Body Talk' is passionate yet very fast. Outside of serious punk, you're hard pressed to find this combination. <br /> <br />Starting out with yet another articulate riff (are you getting the point here folks), 'Looking for Love' has an infectious chorus. If you love sweet choruses, look no further. <br /> <br />'7th Avenue'. Just when you thought it was over. <br /> <br />'It Doesn't Matter' has a cool message for those of us whose atire is not up standard. Sorry, I won't trade my Ratt shirt in for no one. 2006 here I come! <br /> <br />'Take A Chance' throws me into convulsions. It starts out with a Ratt-tastic riff and ends with you a believer. <br /> <br />When I first heard the lyrics that begin 'Enough Is Enough', I wanted to barf, or something. The riffing (and repeated listening) saved this song for me, and Stephen Pearcy's vocals (said vocals sometimes surpass the music on some songs by Ratt, at least for me). <br /> <br /> If you dig Glam Metal riffs at their very best in a rock n' roll formula, but don't allow slight songwriting to mar your listening experience, then RATT should be your band!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is what Exciter could have been. DM are getting back to their dark synth roots and have created a marvelous mix of tracks, my favorites being Precious, A Pain That I'm Used To, Damaged People, and I Want It All. I hardly think that they are betraying their former glory, rather they are building upon it. (It doesn't sound like Nine Inch Nails either, I don't know what NIN cd the other reviewers have been listening to, not even comparable) One cannot expect a band to churn out the same melodies for 20 plus years straight, and you'll be disappointed if you are looking for anything that sounds like their hits from the eighties and early nineties. I grew up with Depeche Mode, have always been a fan and I am impressed with their ability to mature as a band yet stay true to themselves. More realistically comparable to Portishead, Sneaker Pimps, and trippy synth pop. Definitely worth the wait (and the improvement over Exciter)
B0007GAERG|1.0|I'm truly sorry this CD was released and labeled as the comeback of the voice or whatever they chose to call it. Quite honestly this CD is nothing special. The biggest hit \\"We Belong Together\\" sounds like every other song in the category of sappy love songs. Mariah's last good CD was Butterfly, it is all downhill after that CD. Hopefully the next album will be better but until then steer clear of Emancipation... its bad... real bad.

B00004T9UF|5.0|Feminem? hah, get off of Ja's and benzino's d*ck. I agree 50 and Nelly are complete nonsense. But, you can't break Eminem and whoeversaidthe beats were bad. You must've though 'Pac's beat's were complete **** and so were Snoop's. Dre produced em all. If you love rock, shut the **** up and go back to your dieing form of music. I don't need to see a guy go erergargargergarg for 3 minutes. If I wanted get a headache, I'd get wasted. To Kassir, you sound like the fakest piece of **** in the world. Quit hiding behind a computer and trying to be different and cool. You say you listen to KRS, NWA, and etc. NWA all love Eminem besides Eazy cuz he's gone. *RIP* Didn't KRS work with Eminem in The Anthem? Exactly, shut the **** up. Nas even likes Em. Em has proved himself and will be remembered as a legend. His wordplay is amazing and no matter what you do many will love him. Eminem isn't from Detroit? Then, how come he wasn't wiped out like Vanilla, how does he have D12, they are all from Detroit. There are many more white rappers noone knows. Eminem started the era. If you've been to a white ghetto, you'd know it was a lot worse than other ghettos. By the way I'm not white, I'm just proving to y'all that Em is as credible as other rappers, to do that I have to prove white people can grow up poor too. He proved himself to many, noone can break him, try like Everlast, Benzero, and Ja Fool. They all failed and lost everything. Source lost it's credit. Everlast...who? Ja Rule.....who? Exactly, they are gone. This is a classic and better than most albums I've heard. Behind a few though. If you like this try some 'Pac, Rakim, KRS One, Nas, Immortal Tech, or some Jin.....they are amazing rappers as well.
0385510454|3.0|One of the appealing qualities of John Grisham is that he dares to be different on occasion. Many popular fiction writers find a consistent theme and follow that approach novel after novel, but Grisham cannot be so easily characterized. True, most of his writing involves lawyers and the legal profession, but the popular author occasionally will veer away from that theme and readers will find themselves experiencing a book far different from what most would identify as the standard Grisham thriller.<br /><br />THE BROKER is such a book. For this novel Grisham has entered the world of politics, crime and espionage. This thriller is different from anything Grisham has written previously, yet it shares the most important traits that readers expect from a Grisham book --- a fast-paced, entertaining and suspenseful story.<br /><br />In the waning days of his failed four-year term as President of the United States, Arthur Morgan is performing those final duties associated with leaving office. Among those chores are reviewing requests for Presidential pardons. The President is not emotionally up to the task because in his view, \\"How sad that after four tumultuous years of leading the free world it would all fizzle into one miserable pile of requests from a bunch of crooks.\\" But one of those crooks has a very influential advocate on behalf of his pardon. The Director of the CIA makes a rare visit to the White House to suggest that Joel Backman, a former powerful \\"Beltway\\" lobbyist who has spent six years in prison, be released. The President accedes to the wishes of the Director, and Backman finds himself hurriedly summoned to the prison facility where he's incarcerated to work out the hasty conditions of his pardon.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Backman, his pardon is not the result of an altruistic motive by the government. The truth is that the broker is the bait. Backman had gone to prison as a result of a scheme to sell a satellite system to the world's highest bidder. The U.S. wants to know who owned the system and had access to its secrets. They theorize that once the broker is established in a new location with a new identity, the actual owner will exact their revenge on Backman by assassination. In that fashion an important piece of intelligence data now will be unearthed. Backman is the cheese in the mousetrap and the CIA does not worry if he gets eaten so long as they can locate the mouse.<br /><br />Backman is spirited out of the country and relocated to Italy. Most of THE BROKER is set in Bologna, Italy, which may be the first time that a Grisham novel is set outside of his native South. The location gives Grisham an opportunity to share with his readers his love and knowledge of Italian history, architecture and cuisine. As most successful authors do, Grisham has researched his subject matter in great detail. By his own admission he gained 10 pounds while researching THE BROKER.<br /><br />Grisham fans are well aware of his attitude toward the American legal system. In this novel, readers will learn that he also finds the current power structure of Washington, D.C. to be very troubling. One of the unexpected joys of reading THE BROKER is attempting to recognize all of Grisham's allegorical historical references to actual events in American political culture. In this endeavor Grisham is truly non-partisan as he skewers politicians on both sides of the political spectrum and even finds the occasional opportunity to poke fun at the American media and its current kulturekampf.<br /><br />Reading John Grisham is like eating comfort food. Each year his fans await nourishment from a newly published novel. This year's plate is a little different. The traditional meatloaf is served Italian style, but the comfort is still there. Traditional Grisham fans will be required to make a few mental adjustments, but still they will find another well-written and exciting thriller to help pass the time during the cold winter evenings to come..

B000069AT7|5.0|This Review Was Written for the 20th Anniversary DVD Version of the Film:<br />Let me explain something that I feel a lot of people are forgetting. This set doesn't only include the new version, but the old as well. That's a great deal, since you can choose which one you would like to see. If you hate the new effects and CGI, don't watch it. It's that simple.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong. I think the newer version is very silly, and I wonder if Spielberg really thought it looked good when he did it. Maybe if he were to do it in around 10 years, it wouldn't look so animated.<br /><br />I did like the deleted bathroom scene though, even though it was done with CGI. It would have been nice to have seen that in the original, but I guess that would be having my cake and eating it too.<br /><br />There is nothing flawed about this set, it simply just gives some options that not everyone will want to choose. If you enjoy the movie, you will enjoy this set. It's a classic that hasn't lost it's flavor after all these years.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Since writing this review 9 years ago, some things have changed (believe it or not). With the release of Blu-ray and Amazon Instant Video, this has caused some confusion over which version(s) are featured on each format. I currently own the Blu-ray edition that Amazon lists as \\"Multi-format\\" and has a blue cover that says \\"Anniversary Edition\\" at the top and it contains only the ORIGINAL 1982 version of the film (which is undoubtedly the superior version of the two, since it omits the \\"not ready for prime time\\" CGI effects that many believe ruined this classic movie.<br /><br />As noted above, I did enjoy the scene with ET in the bathroom that was added to the 20th anniversary edition and it IS included on this 30th anniversary blu-ray edition as a deleted scene (along with one other scene where Elliot's mom is asked where Elliot is on Halloween).<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is fantastic and it was wonderful to see they decided to use the original 1982 version as opposed to the 2002 version with the added effects. Of course it would have been nice to include both, if for nothing else, to serve as a comparison. But if I had to choose, I am happy to see they dropped the 2002 edition.<br /><br />I hope this clears up any confusion my original review may have caused. Amazon does not separate their reviews based on different versions and my original review is pretty outdated here in 2014. 32 years later, this film is still just as touching and magical as ever and this blu-ray edition really brings it to life for a new generation.cided to use the original 1982 version as opposed to the 2002 version with the added effects.

B000BO0LLS|4.0|Before I review this CD, I just have to say that this is getting ridiculous. I'm a fan of Jennifer Lopez as well as Madonna, but why are you guys devoting reviews to them on a Mariah CD?? I am aware of that whole TeamLamb thing, and I understand why Madonna fans would be upset. And I know Mariah fans have gone onto to other CD's and have done the same thing that you guys are doing, but you guys say that Mariah fans are stupid for doing those sorts of things, so you retaliate by doing the EXACT same thing?? Why don't guys be the bigger people and just ignore all that trash that you see?? In the end that'll make you guys look good.    But enough with that nonsense. I'm gonna finally review the CD.    I was a bit skeptical about this re-release because I usually don't like re-releases. That's why I took off one star. The bonus tracks and the DVD are good nonetheless.    1. IT'S LIKE THAT - As she has done on many of her albums, she started the CD with an up-tempo track which is a good decision. \\"It's Like That' is the perfect single to start her comeback year. It's a fun, light, party song with a bumping beat.    2. WE BELONG TOGETHER - Her surprise 16th No.1 single on the Hot 100. I think it was the perfect song to have as her comeback No.1 hit. It has all the things that people love about Mariah's singles: an amazing vocal performance, a great beat, and it's a mid-tempo ballad. It's a beautiful song. I love the melody.    3. SHAKE IT OFF - Her biggest No.2 single ever, at 6 weeks. I didn't like this at first, but it certainly grew on me. The cool R&B groove that it has is very infectious. Everyone says it sounds like an Usher styled song, but I see it as a Jermaine Dupri styled song. After all, he produced most of Ushers hits.    4. MINE AGAIN - This is a great song! It's a classic old school R&B-styled ballad. She sings the hell out of it, but at times she's kind of yelling. But all-in-all, a great vocal performance. Great melody.    5. SAY SOMETHING (f/ Snoop Dogg)- This is the song that introduced most people to MIMI, since it got leaked last November. A lot of people aren't feeling this song, but I love it!!. I love the beat, the lyrics, and the amazing Neptunes production. There's been so much debate about this song being a single, but it looks like it's not gonna happen. This is definitely a good club song though.    6. STAY THE NIGHT - This is one of my favs on the album. I like the piano sample that's going through the back, and the old school eat. It kind o reminds me of \\"The Roof\\", except in this song, Mariah belts out the lyrics. They sound great and the chorus is really catchy.    7. GET YOUR NUMBER (f/ Jermaine Dupri) - This is another club hit that samples \\"Just an Illusion\\" by Imagination, with a Jermaine Dupri twist. He also sings the chorus, and it kind of sounds like Nelly. The beat in this song is crazy, I love it! The melody and lyrics are so catchy that you can't help but listen to it.    8. ONE AND ONLY (f/ Twista) - This is my least favorite song on the album, because it's not all that catchy. Mariah sings as fast as Twista though, which is impressive considering he's the fastest rapper in the world. It's a mid-tempo R&B/hip-hop song. It sounds like more of a Twista song then a Mariah Carey song.    9. CIRCLES - This song is amazing! Her voice sounds crystal clear and she really shows emotion in this song. It's an old school R&B styled song, it's kind of mid-tempo. It sounds very similar to Alicia Key's hit song \\"You Don't Know My Name\\".     10. YOUR GIRL - This is a very slick R&B song. It's very smooth and Mariah belts out the chorus and the second verse. This is also one of my favorites on the album.    11. I WISH YOU KNEW - This is a soul song that's done with a complete live band. I like the lyrics. The thing I like most about it is the sound of a live audience in the back, it really adds a lot to the song. I really like the horns in the back.     12. TO THE FLOOR (f/ Nelly) - This is another Neptunes' produced track. It sounds similar to Britney Spears \\"Boys\\". It's a very old school sounding funk song. Neptunes' did a great job with the production. Nelly's very charismatic in the song, and he overshadows Mariah.    13. JOY RIDE - This is the slowest song on the album. It's a modern R&B ballad. It's very soothing and nice. It sounds like something that should be on `Charmbracelet'.    14. FLY LIKE A BIRD - Now this is what you call a classic. This song is perfect, it features a live band. Also Mariah's voice builds up momentum the whole song until the end when the choir is singing the chorus and Mariah belts out the adlibs (Carry me home, oh, carry me hoooome). It's amazing. The lyrics, the voice of her pastor, everything. A perfect way to end the album (minus the bonus songs).     15. DON'T FORGET ABOUT US - This is basically a continuation of \\"We Belong Together\\". It sounds like a freestyle ballad that would've been released in the late 80's or early 90's. It's nothing new, but it has an amazing melody, and it's sure to be a huge radio smash. I love it.    16. MAKIN' IT LAST ALL NIGHT (WHAT IT DO) (f/ Jermaine Dupri) - This is another club-banger (I can't get enough of these!). It has the standard Jermaine Dupri up-tempo production. I really like the chorus. Mariah doesn't belt anything out in this song, but it suits it. The beat/rhythm is similar to Bow Wow and Ciara's \\"Like you\\", but faster. Great song!    17. SO LONELY (ONE & ONLY PART II) (f/ Twista) - This song kicks @$$!!! I can't wait to hear it at a club. It's a great R&B/ Hip-hop Collabo. It's much better than part one. Rodney Jerkins really outdid himself on this record. The beat is crazy, and Mariah sounds hot. Twista sounds good also. This features an extra verse by Mariah, which is kind of superfluous, but it doesn't take away from this amazing song.     18. WE BELONG TOGETHER REMIX (f/ Styles P & Jadakiss) - This sounds extremely similar to 3LW's \\"I Can't Take it\\" (Featuring Nas). Most of the lyrics are the same as the original. It has a really good beat, although I could do without the useless rapping by the two members of the Lox. Great remix, nonetheless, and it's a good addition to this CD.      All-in-all, I'm very happy for Mariah because no one expected her to have this massive comeback story, and this album was the perfect one to do the trick. I'm glad she's back doing what she does best: Delivering great club songs and ballads all with her amazing voice.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Basically the release of the album \\"Discovery\\" was just that.  I discovered that the watered down pop techno record that they released was overall total garbage.  With the release of Human After All they return to what Daft Punk is known for.  It's MiniMog Keyboards and MP303 repitition in its finest form.  True fans of Daft Punk enjoy the pure electronic sound that made them truely one of the most beloved mainstream Purists in the genre.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This isn't the usual \\"ugly singers parking and barking\\" kind of production, this is an opera production that really is one:everything looks flawless, sets and costumes actually are Wagnerian, and the angles of the sets and singers are nothing to worry about. Hildegard Behrens and Gwynneth Jones are by far, the loveliest Brunnhilds in Ring productions. We have a big cast. Jessye Norman as Sieglinde is far lovelier than I would've expected her to look here. Hildegard Behrens, to me is one lovely Brunnhilde. Thank you, Otto Schenk. This isn't like most Deutsche grammophon opera videos(Tristan, Fidelio, Fledermaus with ugly sopranos and tenors, ugh!) I feel as if I were Wagner himself when I watch this Ring production. I'm sure you'll like this production too. This is how opera dirctors should tell a story. This isn't the usual Otto Schenk! He actually made the singers look flawless. Even the Seattle opera wouldn't have a Siegfried/Brunnhilde pair or a Siegmund/Sieglind pair anywhere as good-looking as Siegfried Jerusalem, Hildegard Behrens, gary Lakes, and Jessye Norman. Please! Only the Bayreuth/Chereau production would have as flawless a cast as the MET with Der Ring. Highly reccommended! If you can't find this MET video, get the Bayreuth/Chereau Ring. It's every bit as good.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|This movie is by far the best Batman movie ever created.  Unlike the past movies, this one had all the aspects of greatness. <br /> <br />The past movies relied on the concept of fantasy, overacting, and pre-acceptance of less than realistic approach for portraying Batman.  The past movies Were more for children than mature audience.  They relied on making batman a pre-modified super hero who did not have to go through anything but a vague backflash of the deaths of his parents.  This movied took time and effort to establish a story on Bruce Wayne's journey into achieving his status.  No pre assumed training, finance, and control over his wealth.  This time Bruce Wayne had to fight and earn his positions from letting go of the spoiled rich life, to the background of his training, to the question of how he got a hold of all his cool gadgets.  Realism, while there are still some extraordinary events going on, this movie was still very realistic.  Even the Batmobile itself is a real vehicle, not CGI. <br /> <br />The best part of this movie is how the director took the time to tell the story without jumps.  No where in the movie will you go, \\"what the hell just happened?  how did they get there?\\"  The explanations were smooth and clear. <br /> <br />The acting was also a major part in this movie.  the director really wanted to pay attention to realism and not theatrics.  the past movies portrayed the characters as almost comicly with their overacting their parts.  There were no BWAHAHAHAHAHAs in this movie and all characters played their roles as one would expect from any normal person.   <br /> <br />If possible, I would have rated this movie a 10.  And for those who have not yet seen this movie, the ending will DEFINETLY capture you and make you eager for the next installment to come out.
158799190X|5.0|Magnificent book on the \\"why's\\" of life & \\"how's\\" we as humans misinterpret our business & financial environments. Specifically applied to financial markets, this book will give you great insights when designing any business or financial strategy. In addition to \\"Against the Gods\\" by Bernstein,  this is a \\"must read\\" for any business person &/or serious investor.
B00003CXV4|3.0|Given the mixed reviews, I didn't expect to like \\"Sweet November\\" and was utterly taken back to find myself not only enjoying the story, but bawling like a calf at the end. \\"Sweet November\\" is a bittersweet romance between Nelson, a workaholic ad executive, and Sara, a free spirited Bohemian. I agree that Keanu Reeves did some of his best acting here. He often seems flat in other productions. And Charlize Theron was excellent as the seemingly open woman who is hiding secrets about herself (her terminal illness). The supporting cast was excellent with special kudos to Greg German as Nelson's obnoxious fellow ad man, Vince, and Jason Isaacs as Chaz, the gay neighbor. In retrospect, the downer ending may have contributed to the bad reviews. Be forewarned, fellow viewers, the boy and girl do get together in this haunting romance, but the boy eventually loses the girl. Have a lot of Kleenex ready.
B0007OCG56|5.0|The title Spanglish seems to be a metaphor for commuication. The married couple played by Tea Leoni and Adam Sandler are going through a rough patch and having a difficult time understanding each other's needs when along comes a beautiful nanny who speaks no English and yet manages to connect with every member of the family. Cloris Leachman as the eccentric grandmother, steals every scene she's in. Tea Leoni is a talented actor. I wish her character would have been given a better storyline. It seems we just got to see her surface. There are many comedic moments, but I would classify this film as a dramedy. The love triangle is handled sensitively and there is a believeable ending. The children are wonderful. I hope Adam Sandler is given a chance to do more dramatic roles.
B000002NHN|5.0|Her music takes me through time and space. My spirit swirls in the Samhain night above mystic bonfires secreted in sacred groves. There is laughing and dancing, music played fron ancient Celtic instruments fills the air, men and women lift toasts to the gods, and above all there is a shared peace.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of Madonna, but this album is just FANTASTIC!!  <br /> <br />This is the best Madonna record I've heard since 1998's Ray of Light.  <br /> <br />Forget about American Life's annoying beats and political lyrics, this is pure catchy pop/dance music at it's best. <br /> <br />Highlights are: <br />Sorry <br />Let it will be <br />Jump <br />Isaac <br />and the last song Like it or not? <br /> <br />I'll have to say that I REALLY DO LIKE IT :-) <br /> <br />Good work Madge... One more time you're the one and only dancing queen.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This has got to be one of the funniest Ferrell movies of all time. <br />People who don't find it funny are too uptight and need to relax. <br />As for making fun of mental retarted people and animal cruelty, give me a break. They kicked a stuffed animal(obviously fake) off a bridge and all you PETA losers cry about it. Did they go around and pick on real retarted people? NO. Shutup. Why don't you go do something useful in your life and stop human cruelty before defending stuffed animals. <br />This movie has so many 1 liners, it's insanely funny.

B000002868|4.0|This album is like weather, mostly reminds me of a rainy day with a lot of static in the air and some solar wind blowing off somewhere into space. The music is full of sound like in the bass-laden Umberllas or the sax-sqealing on Seventh Arrow. Then it can quiet down into a soft comtemperary Orange Lady or the or easy going Moring Lake. What ever mood you feeling this album will have it. This album is also like a stripped down version of Weather Report there isn't any texture or synth sound coming from Zawinul, but they sound better with out it think.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart of Eurythmics made some memorable songs in the '80s. They made synthesizer based pop, but they sounded just as strong as any live band of musicians.  I still love Sweet Dreams are Made of This.  They had the rarity of releasing two albums in 1983, both Sweet Dreams and Touch. The Touch-released singles came mostly during late '83 and early '84.  But I have found myself playing Who's That Girl a lot, since I felt that it didn't get as much a response as their other singles.  I liked their soul and live horns direction with Would I Lie To You and Sisters are Doin' It for Themselves in 1985.  Didn't follow them as much in '86-87, but the songs I heard were solid on here. They balanced synth pop with rock songs in most places. I like the two new songs, which I thought were off their '80s albums.  I've Got a Life has a little bit of the triangle/bells sounds from Sweet Dreams in it, so they recall their past as well as keeping up in 2005. Would have sounded good on Annie's last album, Bare.And Was It Just Another Love Affair sounds like it could have been recorded in 1987. But they both blend well with the 15 '80s songs and 2 '99 songs that dominate this collection. Some of the songs were those I heard for the first time since I heard mainly the hit singles from those albums. I could understand them taking a long break since each were so focused on their solo and musical projects. Annie's singing is so phenomenal. Dave's musical prowess is just astounding on all the songs. Here Comes the Rain Again still sounds moving every time. I love the comfortable I Saved The World Today. The Miracle Of Love was something I really liked on this album. I Need a Man has that rocking feel to it.  Missionary Man still has that funky groove to it. Sometimes, a few of the numbers reflected the '80s with the synth pop sound so common in several artists and groups. But the music still holds up and there is a loyal audience that still listens to it two decades later today.  Also, Eurythmics performs on the American Music Awards on November 22nd, so this feels full circle seeing them perform again.  This compilation is just superb chance-taking pop that gave them many platinum albums and awards.

B000B8QF00|5.0|...But this is an excellent overview of Alanis Morissette's decade in music. Exactly 10 years ago, I heard You Oughta Know countless times...it was so funky and rocking at the same time! And that Jagged Little Pill album continued to sell and sell like crazy the last 4 months of 1995!  I think she has gotten better and better as a musician and songwriter, with songs like Thank You, Everything, and my favorite post-Jagged era song from her, Hands Clean.  The unplugged songs are good and I liked that she included songs she recorded for movie soundtracks.  Alanis has had an effect on the current series of young female rock singers, especially Avril Lavigne (who sounds like Alanis sometimes), Hilary Duff, Fefe Dobson, Kelly Clarkson, Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan and others who prefer a rock sound and a lot of attitude.  I can't wait to see what she'll unleash next for future albums! For now, this collection of songs tells us how much of an impact she made on music in the '90s.

B00008S2VG|4.0|While her 2003 set yielded no hit singles (her first to not have any crack the Top 100), \\"American Life\\" saw Madonna pushing forward with producer Mirwais Ahmadzai to create musical soundscapes that while odd, could make for interesting listening.<br /><br />Don't be confused.  This is far from a \\"political\\" record, not to be compared with Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\", but it finds Madonna comparing her own personal politics (about life) alongside what we as a Western culture view as the \\"American Life\\".  I see it as a more philosophical debate.  That aside, this set is definitely for the open minded & isn't about hooks; at least part of the time.<br /><br />The record opens with the black sheep title track single.  Over breakbeats, looped guitars, & other various bleeps & bloops...Madonna once again asks if her fame is worth it. I personally love this track, it has a very kooky sensibility about it, right down to her Deborah Harry-esque rap; which was satire, but some people never got it.<br /><br />From there other highlights include the 2002 Bond theme \\"Die Another Day\\" (a Mirwais classic) which starts with a very immediate, almost \\"dangerous\\" string lament, then segues into tango steps, which eventually mutate into the electronic drums.  \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" ranks alongside \\"Human Nature\\" with it's fierce attitude, a response to the public's perception of her; though lyrically more reserved, Mirwais' arrangement does all the talking.  The beat slaps, drags, & challenges the listener to disagree.  Urgent, relentless, & sleek come to mind when I hear this track.  \\"Intervention\\" & \\"Easy Ride\\" I think are classic Madonna ballads in the making.  \\"Hollywood\\" is saccharine in nature but the sinister soul it hides shows itself toward the end of the song, when Madonna's clipped vocoder voice tells the lisenter to \\"trip the station, change the channel\\".<br /><br />But here is where we get into murky water. To me, Mirwais Ahmadzai was Shep Pettibone in 2003. Shep produced Madonna's finest single moment, 1990's \\"Vogue\\".  That project gave Madonna the chutzpah to think that Pettibone (while talented) could give her a whole album's worth of material.  1992's \\"Erotica\\", also a transitional record proved that while he was talented, & made other classic single & album track moments, he was a producer you wouldn't want for the long haul.  So could be said with Ahmadzai, who would redo the same situation with the title track single of 2000's \\"Music\\". That single showed Madonna again at the peak of singles prowess.  Did that mean that Mirwais should do another record? Maybe not.<br /><br />Songs such as \\"X-Static Process\\" & \\"Mother & Father\\", lyrically continue to show Madonna's need to connect with her audience, sonically come off as half finished instead of raw. Rawness being the aesthic Madonna was clearly intending. Lyrically, those songs are still fascinating.<br /><br />Either way, you have a record that came off not as raw as intended, at least on it's failed experiments. Personally, I find Mirwais' arrangements to be too cold. If Madonna wanted to sound confessional, personal, & raw (which at times she did), Mirwais' arrangements in some cases aren't the vehicle for it.  The songs seem detached & unemotional, putting up what seems to be a slightly more musical paranoid wall to Madonna's stream of consciousness words.<br /><br />While these production values were cute on the swirly \\"Music\\", here it really showed that Madonna could use another producer who could bring out ALL of the best in her, not just some. Then again I could be bias. Though, \\"American Life\\" excels for showing that Madonna is about pushing herself, experimenting, & evolution.  Sometimes evolution works & other times it doesn't.<br /><br />Still, better than the average pop on the radio, which Madonna's records always are.uced Madonna's finest single moment, 1990's \\"Vogue\\".

B000002I99|4.0|Alice Cooper offers a mixed bag of tunes.  There are a couple of catchy anthem-type rockers (\\"Department of Youth\\" and \\"Escape\\"), but most sound like numbers from a twisted musical about necrophilia and serial murder.  The trilogy of \\"Years Ago/Steven/The Awakening\\" is too heavy-handed and obvious, but the rest of the album offers prime examples of why Cooper became rock's premiere showman during the 70s.  Vincent Price's cameo at the beginning of \\"Black Widow\\" is fun.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I'll admit it; I like Radiohead a lot. The best band ever...well that is highly subjective but for me they are up there with the best. They have pushed the barriers for what is acceptable as pop with Kid A and Amnesiac and although those albums are less cohesive than OK Computer they are still amazing. OK Computer is almost perfect in its atmosphere, textures, musicianship and message. BUT what I like the most (and this is very unfanboy) is that it was wildly successful. For music as challenging but rewarding as this to heard and appreciated by the masses can only be a good thing. Long live Radiohead and if they ever manage to make an album which tops this one then I reckon they should officially be canonised, knighted and made leaders of the free world. Or maybe just appreciated as the best band ever...

B000B5XOY8|5.0|Tim Burton's Batman is dark and gothic, and while after several years I find fault with this film, all in all, I enjoyed it when it opened in 1989. Batman (Keaton) has started out fighting crime in Gotham and he will soon fight against the Joker (Nicholson). Batman creates the Joker, but in the end one sees that the Joker created the Batman.<br /><br />The plot is choppy, but Nicholson's Joker keeps the audience watching. While over the top, it is still a great performance. Keaton's Batman is brooding and dark, but believes in seeking out the criminal element. The movie sets are nice, but one never feels they are in a real world and the movie suffers from it. The fight scenes, the few there are, are nothing spectacular and Burton misses opportunities to capture his audience here.<br /><br />Still, the movie feels surreal and ultimately it is a viewing pleasure. Burton sparks the movie box-office boom for that year. Danny Elfman's score is simply spectacular. Jack Palance, Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl provide strong performances. Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale is fair and Billy Dee Williams is left with little to do. Pat Hingle is miscast as Gordon and is never developed in the next three movies. The movie really is a four star deal; however, the extras excel.<br /><br />Everything from the DVD's graphics to the special documentaries and interviews, the second disks is outstanding! It is one of the best special editions around.  The history of Batman documentary is great, with interviews with great Batman artists and writers like Denny O'Niel and Frank Miller.  Comic historian and Excuetive Producer Michael Usland is inetrviewed throughout many of teh differnt segments.  Peter Guber's energy still shows through 16 years after making this picture.  He brings a lot of insight into the movie making process.  Of course, Burton, Keaton, Basinger, and Nicholson provide their insights as well.  I think one will find Nicholson's comments interesting and yes, like his Joker, a little funny.<br /><br />While the movie suffers from a week narrative, the visuals, musical score, and acting performances are superb.  Burton restored the dark Batman to the silver screen, and the faults that do exist do not destroy this movie from being entertaining.er, a little funny. <br /> <br />While the movie suffers from a week narrative, the visuals, musical score, and acting performances are superb.

038073186X|4.0|This was my first Dennis LeHane novel. I read this book two years ago and as result of this, I read several other novels by the author. First, I never saw the  surprise ending coming. Afterwards I went back over the book  and  I saw that there were incidences that now made sense . It's an excellent book. Two law enforcement officiers arrive on Shutter island (which houses a psychiatric hospital in order to investigate a missing patient.  A storm prevents them from returning to the mainland. That's as far as I'll go.
B000BB1MHS|5.0|Although i did enjoy the first willy wonka movie, I was much more pleased with Tim burton's version. Somehow the story made much more sense to me in this version, and the acting was a lot better. Depp, i think, is the perfect Willy Wonka, the character is a strange man, i don't think another actor could have done a better job. Of course this version of Wonka doesn't seem like a happy childrens story but, hey, the ones who first saw the original are grown up now. This movie was well thought out, as are all the Tim burton films i've seen. I was entertained throughout the entire movie. This is, in my opinion, the way the story should have went!

B000A0GP4K|5.0|Well, as a 56 year old, I grew up with Bob Dylan's music. I also lived in New York in the 1960s and spent many of my teenage weekends in Greenwich Village. This film brings back all those days magnificently. Martin Scorsese after his brilliant ode to the Blues in 2003 has done it again! This 4 hour journey is worth watching again and again. You see new things each time you watch it, a mark of a great filmmaker! It just screened on TV here in Australia last week, but the DVD has been available here for over a month.<br /><br />My music interests are primarily a love for the Blues (see my reviews), but this film clearly puts the link between folk and blues together. My favourite parts of this DVD are the \\"Electric\\" folk Dylan performed with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Al Kooper (Blues Project, Blood, Sweat and Tears) and Mike Bloomfield. Films of Mike Bloomfield playing are exceedingly scarce (Monterrey, The Recent Blues Reunion DVD). Dylan unfolds the story of him meeting Bloomfield and asking him to help him go electric. They even show part of the set they did at Newport! You can hear but not see Mike! For the uninitiated, hear Mike on the PBBB East-West CD.<br /><br />This film follows Bob Dylan through his early career in the 1960s until his motorcycle accident towards the end of the decade. It is a perfect time frame. It shows the social and cultural changes in America, how music was part of them and how they contributed to the outcomes. We who were young at this time remember these days well- Civil Right's, The Women's Movement and  Vietnam! However, what I really love about Dylan in this film is that he shys away from any recognition for his contributions to these movements. Dylan is an enigma and that's always been part of his appeal.<br /><br />I am a Blues fan and not an expert on Dylan or his music. I found this DVD surprisingly entertaining and very interesting. I loved the way Dylan comes off and a person who did but didn't want fame, the best line in the whole thing is \\"I just slipped in the door when nobody was looking and there wasn't anything anybody could do about it!\\" He also indicates, like John Lennon did, that his songs were written as clusters of words he liked or sounded good and not necessarily to make any social points. Which I always thought anyway. People read what they wanted to in his music. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the best performance is \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" at the Newport Topical Song Workshop, with Pete Seeger in the background. Great!<br /><br />This film is an essential addition to anyone's collection.just slipped in the door when nobody was looking and there wasn't anything anybody could do about it!\\" He also indicates, like John Lennon did, that his songs were written as clusters of words he liked or sounded good and not necessarily to make any social points.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Let me make something emphatically clear.  I could care less about Madonna's public life.  I don't care about her milquetoast politics, her child rearing advice, her sexuality, her forays into Judaism Lite, her broken ribs, her hypocritical rants about the evils of materialism while she basks in the glory of her English castle. Yadda yadda yadda.  Don't care about any of it.<br /><br />But the woman can make a good dance album when she puts her mind to it.<br /><br />Enter \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\"  This is the sort of album Madonna never should've stopped making.  This is the one that will make drag queens scream mercy from clubs all across the globe when they hear it.  Strong techno beats bob and weave their way through nearly an hour of music to work out to, dance to or clean your house to.  The downer here is Madonna's silly lyrics.  What was she thinking when she sings an ode to NY and rhymes New York with Dork?  What are we in here?  Kindergarten?  But even I can forgive her such hurried nonsense when the music is this motivating.  And I'm a tough egg to crack when it comes to today's tunes.  If you want to get your heart pumping to a 4/4 beat until it cries uncle, this is the dance CD to invest in.  If you're looking for deep lyrics, stick with  genuine Jews who know how to write them like Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen.  Madonna is about as Jewish as a pork chop at Passover.  And she's about as Kosher as a Happy Meal.  Discuss.
B00005JOGU|4.0|For just a while, \\"Capote\\" is a book lover's dream. <br /> <br />Completely aside from the fact that the film documents the creation of Truman Capote's tainted masterpiece, \\"In Cold Blood,\\" it also flits quickly and tantalizingly through his world and the literary scene of New York, 1960 -- there's \\"The New Yorker\\" editor William Shawn; that's photographer Richard Avedon; Harper Lee is even seen receiving word that her book, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" has found a publisher. <br /> <br />And in the midst of it all is the title character, a catty, fey figure whom we first see holding court at a crowded house party and dropping James Baldwin's name; but, as portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, he's still a pretty charming show-off. <br /> <br />Fairly soon, however, he's compelled to write about a mass murder in Kansas, where a family of four has been shotgunned in its remote country home, and as he awkwardly investigates the crime, the movie's temperature drops gradually and considerably.  <br /> <br />Capote, however, is too filled with glee over finding such rich story material to accurately process the tragedy. It's not until he befriends one of the killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), that the crimes and their repercussions really begin to affect him and, eventually, seem to poison him. <br /> <br />Screenwriter Dan Futterman has adapted Gerald Clarke's biography in a straightforward manner that feels a little like a procedural, and first-time director Bennett Miller has a real touch for capturing washed-out rooms, haunted faces and gloomily atmospheric landscapes. No matter when or where you see it, \\"Capote\\" is a chilly Sunday night of a movie. <br /> <br />The actors are equally low-key and deft. Collins (who looks a little like Robert Downey Jr. sharing the same face with Steve Buscemi) drifts swiftly between seeming sympathetic and shamelessly pragmatic; and Catherine Keener is endearing, if a little underused, as Harper Lee. <br /> <br />But as good as all the other elements are, this is really Hoffman's show. He's built differently than Capote (he's an inch under six feet and Capote was 5'3\\") but Miller uses seamless techniques to make him appear smaller than his surroundings. The rest of the performance, however, is no trick: Hoffman both channels the author's famous quirks and presents a spot-on portrait of a writer who gets exactly what he hoped for, but figures out too late it wasn't at all what he needed.  <br /> <br />

B000B8QEZG|1.0|This album does have a \\"Kylie Minogue\\" aura to it, but it's definatley a Madonna album. Some songs are catchy. Some are filler. There's a couple of songs that are pretty stupid... \\"I Love New York\\" for example. But all in all, it ain't half bad. Someone in this forum chose a good word to describe this album... VANILLA.  <br />This is definatley not a mainstream album. People who are not as musically diverse won't like this album at all. TAKE IT FROM ME, A LONG TIME MADONNA FAN... \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is one you will have to gamble with, so borrow it from a friend OR QUIT BEING CHEAP and just get the album. It's not a big investment!  <br />
B000002J6F|5.0|I have of course always been a Stills fan. I owned all the Stills solo stuff on vinyl and wore the grooves out in the early seventies so I have been replacing the records with CDs. I have always played guitar and own a Martin myself and I guess you might even say that Stills is a hero of mine, and therefore I am very biased. Stills has always seemed to have lived in the shadow of Neil Young and I love Neil along with everybody else, but going back and getting this Classic, this work of art, this symbol of the best time in popular music, is a real positive experience. If you want to know Stills, and to feel that era, and remember when real talent ruled, get this CD! Get it now!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to say I've been very disappointed in Madonna's last two CDs.  I've never been one for electronica so they really didn't appeal to me.  I guess with this CD I'm admitting that I still get a kick out of dance music -- even though I couldn't dance a step if my life depended on it.  This CD is, in many ways, a return to Madonna's beginnings.  Every tune is not only danceable, but also great to listen to over and over.  Nearly every song on the CD is great. \\"hung Up,\\" \\"Get Together,\\" \\"Future Lovers,\\" and \\"I Love New York\\" are my favorites. I downloaded this CD through iTunes so I also got a copy of the video for \\"Hung Up,\\" and I have to say this mother of two in her 40s still has it.  Over the years her vocal abilities have certainly improved (thanks in part to her training for Evita), but she can still hold her own on a dance floor with kids half her age.  This CD may not be a re-invention of Madonna, but it certainly reminds us why Madonna is one of the greats of her generation.
B00005UKE0|5.0|George Harrison for many years learned how to write a song under John Lennon and Paul McCartney leared his lesson very well. <br />Harrison over the last few years with the Beatles wrote some memorable songs such as Taxman, Something, Here comes the Sun, and several others. <br />When the Beatles broke up Harrison was at his creative peek.  <br />All Things must pass is without a doubt the best post Beatles album ever released by a former Beatle <br />Many of the songs on this album are classics. <br />Wah Wah, My Sweet Lord, Isnt it a Pity, What is Life, Beware of Darkness, All Things must Pass and a cover of Bob Dylans If not for You. <br />With the assistance of many musicians including Eric Clapton, Klauss Voorman, Billy Preston and many others, Harrison released one of the all-time classics. <br />This proved to be his finest moment. He was never able to equal or surpass the success of this CD. Truely one of Rocks better albums ever
B000001F7R|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />If someone played you \\"On Through the Night,\\" without telling you who it was at first, you may be very surprised to learn that it's Def Leppard's debut album. Released in early 1980, before the band hooked up with its sixth unofficial member, producer John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, \\"On through the Night\\" sounds nothing like any other album in the British quintet's catalogue. While Def Leppard, along with Van Halen, proved to be the decade's innovators, more or less in inventing the formula known as \\"pop-metal,\\" on their debut, Def Leppard was just another band from the NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal). In addition, with a hint of blues-based metal and Jimmy Page-esque riffs and arraignments, there is a clear influence of Led Zeppelin on \\"On Through the Night.\\" Tom Allom, who produced such Judas Priest classics as \\"British Steel\\" (1980) and \\"Screaming for Vengeance,\\" (1982) was on board for \\"On Through the Night\\" and it shows.<br /><br />While Def Leppard's debut is somewhat derivative of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Led Zeppelin, it's still an excellent album. The thing that immediately strikes the listener is how young the band sounds. At the time of its release, the members of Def Leppard were in their late teens and early 20s. The band sounds so youthful, so hungry, and so wanting to rock. Singer Joe Elliot sounds great, doing the best Robert Plant/Rob Halford/Bon Scott impersonation that anyone could hope for. Guitarists Steve Clarke (lead) and Pete Willis (rhythm) provide tremendous instrumental firepower. While their playing isn't groundbreaking, they sound alive and invigorated. Steve Clarke shows early on that he was \\"the riff-master,\\" delivering killer song after song. \\"On Through the Night\\" may be a little unoriginal, but the riffs and solos are fully captivating and effective. Bassist Rick Savage and drummer Rick Allen provide an exciting and dynamic rhythm section.<br /><br />On \\"On Through the Night,\\" the band just plain sounds good. One thing going for this album is that it sounds very live. There aren't a lot of overdubs, it sounds as though the band just went into the studio, cut an album in a few takes, and that was that.<br /><br />A lost Leppard classic, the opening \\"Rock Brigade\\" takes no prisoners and makes the band's ambitions to play the arenas known. It sounds almost like a sped-up version of \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" from Led Zeppelin I (1969). An early hit, \\"Hello America\\" shows even without Mutt Lange, the band's innate pop-sensibility. As others have noted, the light keyboards add a nice effect. Led Zeppelin again makes its influence known with the hard-rocking-but-bluesy \\"Sorrow is a Woman.\\" \\"It could be you,\\" with its echoing vocals and Jimmy Page inspired riff, sounds a lot like Led Zeppelin's \\"The Immigrant Song,\\" as noted by others. The melodic, metallic \\"Satellite,\\" sounds as though it came right from Judas Priest's \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" (1980) album. Def Leppard comes very close to Spinal Tap country with the Iron Maiden/Dungeons and Dragons mythological epic \\"When the Walls Came Tumbling Down.\\" It's a little silly, and dated, but the song rocks hard and is effective. \\"On Through the Night\\" goes into full-out heavy metal mode with the blistering \\"Wasted.\\" Judas Priest again rears it influence with the slightly generic \\"Rocks Off.\\" While not a great song, it's good and keeps up the momentum. \\"It don't Matter,\\" gets the album back on track with its engrossing, mild-mannered verse that builds up into a satisfying melodic chorus. \\"Answer to the Master\\" is another good-but-not-great Zeppelin inspired mid-paced rocker. The album ends triumphantly with the majestic \\"Overture,\\" which sounds like a cross between \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and Boston's \\"More than a Feeling.\\"<br /><br />When people think of Def Leppard, they undoubtedly think of such classics as \\"Pyromania,\\" (1983) and \\"Hysteria,\\" or the stink-bomb \\"Adrenalize\\" (1992). \\"On Through the Night,\\" and its equally underrated follow-up \\"High and Dry,\\" (1982) have unfortunately been overlooked and remain lost gems. While \\"On Through the Night\\" isn't the most groundbreaking or original album in the world, it's still a fine CD that fans of Def Leppard and rock in general should check out.y underrated follow-up \\"High and Dry,\\" (1982) have unfortunately been overlooked and remain lost gems.

B0000C8AVX|5.0|Bringing it all back home could very well be Dylans finest album. <br />In my mind the only album that could rival it would be The Freewheelin Bob Dylan. <br />This CD is loaded with hits and personal favorites. Many are songs that are not that well known, except fot people who know and who study Bob Dylan. <br />Dylan was a spokesman for his generation and this is certainly one reason why. <br />Its amazing how over the years many of Dylans songs remain true. <br />Dylan has always dealt with Civil Rights and spoken out about the injustice of politicians. <br />Mr Tambourine Man appears on this CD and remains one of his classics today. <br />Gates of Eden is a personal favorite. It's alright ma, I'm only bleeding is another statement and a personal favorite as well. <br />Its all over now baby Blue is another great song. <br />Love minus zero/no limit is another great song and another personal favorite. <br />This CD is not for casual listeners, its for people who want to digest his lyrics and want to hear what he has to say. <br />Truely a classic in every regard and a must for any Dylan fan
B000000OQF|5.0|Rock went though a bit of a low point in the mid-to-late 80s. Aerosmith had gone commercial, Roth had left Van Halen, and it was not an era of the Rolling Stones, Ozzy, or Motley Crue's best work. In `86/'87, the most popular up-and-coming rock bands in the mainstream were Bon Jovi and Poison. In the mid-to-late 80s, rock really needed a shot in the arm.<br /><br />In the summer of 1987 an album was released by a new band in LA. At the time of its release, no one could have guessed that it would one day be regarded as arguably the greatest hard-rock album of all-time. The day the album came out scores of people were not lined up to buy it. It didn't get a world premier broadcast. The day it was released, it was just another album among many. Outside people familiar with the Sunset Strip scene, no one had ever heard of Guns N' Roses. However, in just a few short months, all of this would change. With just one album, \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" (1987) Guns N' Roses quickly became the baddest, loudest, raunchiest band in the world.<br /><br />\\"Appetite for Destruction\\" has sold over 15 million copies in the US alone since its release. Almost every song on the album is well-known to people who aren't even rock fans and over half the album's songs remain radio staples to this day. \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" was the rock n' roll bible for a generation of kids growing up during the Reagan and Bush I eras. And now, almost two decades later, one can still spot kids sporting a Gun N' Roses t-shirt. The success of Guns N' Roses \\"Greatest Hits,\\" Velvet Revolver's \\"Contraband,\\" (both 2004) and the fever pitch anticipation of the legendary forever upcoming \\"Chinese Democracy,\\" is a testament to the legacy of Guns N' Roses and \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" in particular.<br /><br />So what's so great about \\"Appetite for Destruction\\"? What separates \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" from a million other albums? Why is it held up on such a pedestal? Two reasons that immediately come to mind are (1) its authenticity and (2) its great, great songs.<br /><br />In the annals of rock, there have been so many poseurs over the years. There have been so many people acting all dangerous and badass, but without the credentials to back it up. At the time of \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" an obvious offender that comes to mind is Bon Jovi. A generation later it was Bush. And then it was Limp Bizkit. When you watch a video by any of these bands, you'll notice that it's just a pose. Whether it is Jon Bon Jovi, or Gavin Rosdale, or Fred Durst, they're totally inauthentic. They all sing about being outsiders and misunderstood, but they're nothing but candy-asses, or in the case of Fred Durst, illiterate apes. What made Guns N' Roses so great is that they were real. They were genuinely a bunch of f@#k-ups, misfits, and societal outcasts. When you listen to \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" the songs strike the listener as genuine and lived in, which accounts for why the album has struck such a chord with generations of teens and will no doubt continue to do so in the years to come.<br /><br />The most obvious answer for explaining the success \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" is of course, it has killer, killer songs. But what made these songs great exactly? The answer is \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" is the perfect blend of classic rock, punk, pop, and metal. The duel assault of Slash and Izzy Stradlin was a fiercer, more intense update of the classic styling of Keith Richard/Ron Wood and Joe Perry/Brad Whitford. While most guitarists from the 80s tried to emulate the hammer-on technique and rapid-fire tapping of Eddie Van Halen, lead guitarist Slash was a return to the blues based playing of yore. Slash, a huge Aerosmith fan, and Stradlin, a huge Stones fan, brought the classic styling of those bands into the GN'R sound. Bassist Duff McKagan, a native of Seattle and a player of that scene, brought an element of punk into GN'R's collective stew. Drummer Steven Adler, while not the most technically proficient drummer in the world, gave the songs on \\"Appetite\\" an extra kick. His drumming had real soul and helped give the songs their groove. While \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" can be labeled \\"hard rock,\\" or \\"metal,\\" the songs had an undeniable pop-sensibility, but without loosing its balls-to-the-walls metallic edge.<br /><br />While the musicians of \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" no doubt erupted tremendous instrumental firepower and was a force to be reckoned with, it was lead singer W. Axl Rose that put the songs over the top. While the chronicles of rock are no doubt filled with countless legends, never before or since has their quite been a singer like Axl Rose. To his detractors he is a racist, homophonic, self-indulgent prima-donna. To his legions of loyal fans, however, he is more than just a singer or even legend. To the faithful, he is a tortured, messianic genius. Guns N' Roses music seethes with so much emotion; anger, fear, nihilism, loneliness, defiance, and insecurity. So much feeling can be felt though the blue-collar street poetry and singing of Axl Rose, it is no small wonder why fans still hungrily await for their hero's return, despite having been virtually MIA for the past decade and a half.<br /><br />From the opening chords and siren wail of \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" one is immediately swept into the drug and crime-ridden underbelly of LA's Sunset Strip, circa 1987.<br /><br />The classic opening track epitomizes and is no doubt the most powerful song of the 1980s LA metal scene.<br /><br />Duff McKagan shows his punk roots for the blistering \\"It's so Easy.\\" Axl Rose is at his defiant prime. It's not just what he says, it's the way he says it. With his baritone angry growl, when he says \\"why don't you just, f!#k off!,\\" you know he means business.<br /><br />\\"Nightrain,\\" a tribute to cheap wine by that name, demonstrates to the listener, just what life is like at the edge, with nothing left to lose. I've listened to Slash's blistering, over-the-top solo towards the end of that song a million times, and I never tire of hearing it.<br /><br />A timeless theme in rock n' roll is defiance. So many songs have been written which tell of its protagonist's plea to be free from persecution. But never has anyone sounded more genuine in this belief than Axl Rose in the Sex Pistols meets Aerosmith appeal \\"Out Ta Get Me.\\"<br /><br />Adler shines with his groove-laden intro in the ode to heroin \\"Mr. Brownstone.\\" The choruses of \\"I used to do a little...\\" is so infectious, it's hard to forget once you've heard it only once.<br /><br />Rose tells of his sickness of the harsh world and desire to find peace in the arena-rocking anthem \\"Paradise City,\\" a definitive rock classic of the 1980s.<br /><br />Rose sounds course and harsh, yet equally sensitive in the sweltering \\"My Michelle.\\"<br /><br />The elegant but rocking \\"Think about you\\" is probably the most underrated song on \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" The first of two ballads, it is no doubt overshadowed by the song that follows.<br /><br />Rose completely lets his guard down for the sensitive \\"Sweet Child O' Mine.\\" More than just another generic love song, it's a song about finding true love, solace and peace, in a world and society gone mad. Slash's classic intro and stunning solo remain some of the most memorable guitar work ever, in the rock genre.<br /><br />The okay-but-not-great lighting fast \\"You're Crazy\\" and the obligatory ode to sex \\"Anything Goes\\" are the only songs I often skip over when I listen to AFD. They're not bad, they're better than most songs of its type, it just that they pale in comparison to the rest of the album.<br /><br />GN'R saved one of the best for last with the Zeppelin like \\"Rocket Queen.\\" With its killer groove, monster solos, intense rhythm section, and insolent, cocky, but ultimately sensitive delivery, \\"Rocket Queen\\" sums up all of \\"Appetites\\" qualities in one foul swoop.<br /><br />While I am a big fan of Guns N' Roses entirecatalogue and love the artistic epics on the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" (1991) albums, for a no-holds-bar, kick-ass, rock album, I always turn to \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" to deliver. Along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" (1991) the Doors self-titled debut album, (1967) The Jimi Hendrix Experience's \\"Are You Experienced,\\" (1967) Led Zeppelin's \\"Zoso,\\" (1971) and Jane's Addiction \\"Nothing Shocking (1988), \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" it is one of the finest hard-rock recordings of all-time.Slash's blistering, over-the-top solo towards the end of that song a million times, and I never tire of hearing it.  <br /> <br />A timeless theme in rock n' roll is defiance.

B000AL730O|4.0|Paul McCartney since the break up of the Beatles has been inconsistant. Some of his albums have not even been worth listening to, and others are brilliant. Over the years I have bought just about all of them and I have to say I have only kept a few.   Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is one of the few that is Beatle quality. Paul seems to come out of his rut, and like with Flaming Pie he has come up with an outstanding album.  This is not only a fine album but some of the best songs he has ever written are on here.  Songs of note are Fine Line and How kind of You and Friends to Go. Now for the best ever. Jenny Wren is along the lines of Blackbird. The guitar is very similar. Paul has really outdone himself on that one.   There is also a song called Engish Tea that I find myself listening to over and over.  Paul is British and I love songs that sound British, this is a real treat. This is for Beatles fans as well as McCartney fans.
B000001OAA|5.0|When one looks back at the alternative rock scene that dominated the first half of the 90s, Garbage's self-titled debut album immediately comes to mind as a defining album from that movement. A decade old as of this writing, \\"Garbage\\" (1995) has stood the test of time and not only contains some of the best singles from the 90s, but is a modern-day classic.<br /><br />\\"Garbage\\" has many elements in its sound which can explain its broad appeal. The songs are so incredibly infectious and danceable, fans of dance-pop (Madonna, Janet Jackson) are sure to enjoy the album. But \\"Garbage\\" is undeniably a rock album, first and foremost. With crunching guitars, intense drumming, and a charismatic frontwoman, a more rock inclined audience is sure to dig \\"Garbage\\" as well. Garbage's music also encompasses an element of 70s/80s cool new-wave.  In a sense, Garbage was like an updated version of Blondie for the 1990s, so fans yearning for a new Debbie Harry are sure to appreciate Garbage.<br /><br />Another reason \\"Garbage\\" struck such a chord with the public is there really wasn't another band quite like them. There were bands that were precursors to Garbage, like Curve, and My Bloody Valentine, among others, but they didn't take off and explode as Garbage did, for whatever reason, probably due to marketing and timing. Garbage's debut came out at the perfect time. In an era of post-grunge, where many up-and-coming bands were clearly derivative of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, Garbage's brand of rock/pop/retro offered a refreshing change of pace. While Garbage's cynical themes fit the disparaging alt. rock 90s like a glove, the lyrics are often tongue-in-cheek. In this sense, Garbage had the best of both worlds: cynical lyrics for cynical times, but with the playful, sexy trimmings of Blondie.<br /><br />Because the musicians of Garbage, Butch Vig, (drums) Steve Marker, (guitar) and Duke Erickson, (guitar) were made up of first-rate producers, namely Butch Vig, they knew how to craft songs meticulously and methodically.  They also happened to be great songwriters' to-boot. Great songwriters and producers' aside, the band still needed the perfect singer...enter Shirley Manson.<br /><br />While working on songs for their new band, Vig, Marker, and Erickson spotted the Scotch-born Shirley Manson on MTV. At the time Manson was the lead singer for (the underrated) Angelfish. Knowing Manson would be the perfect singer, the band sent out the word and a short time later Manson joined the group, thus Garbage was born.<br /><br />It's one thing to have great songs and producers, but the perfect singer is needed to put a face on the music and the image. Truth be told, Garbage without Manson would have been like Van Halen without David Lee Roth. Without Manson, Garbage most likely would have been a good, but untimely forgettable band, a footnote in the 90s.  While the songs on \\"Garbage\\" are excellent, no doubt, it is Manson that truly makes them shine. Truly a gifted singer, she can change from sounding sensitive to indifferent, seductive to vengeful, passionate to passive, all in a single breath. While her beautiful voice can enchant, it can also scorn. Much like Nico before her, Manson is a true femme fatale. Manson proved to be very popular with males and females alike. Her self-confidence, integrity, and self-empowerment no doubt struck a chord with a female audience. Being extremely attractive, a femme fatale, a sort of black widow, was no doubt appealing to men.<br /><br />Garbage's unique brand of electronic pop/rock is demonstrated immediately with the seductive \\"Supervixen.\\" Manson sounds as though she gets sadistic pleasure as she plays with the listener, telling her audience to \\"bow down to me.\\" The off-beat \\"Queer\\" is equally seductive, and quite mesmerizing, leaving a lasting impression. The album's massive hit, the super infectious \\"Only Happy When it Rains\\" is without doubt, one of the greatest rock songs from the 1990s. It both epitomizes and mocks the self-involvement and narcissism of generation X. If Manson had toyed with the listener up to this point, she now shows her teeth with the aggressive \\"as Heaven is Wide.\\" With its almost Black Sabbath-like riff, with electronic trimmings, it makes for an intriguing and captivating listen.  The good-but-not-great \\"Not my Idea\\" is cut from the same cloth and keeps up the momentum. The somewhat spacey, \\"Stroke of Luck\\" shows traces of both beauty and darkness, as Manson lets her guard down as she sings \\"did you know  I was lost until you found me.\\" One of the catchiest, most memorable songs on the album, the vindictive \\"Vow\\" is both unforgiving and seductive. An ode to female empowerment, Manson shows her contempt for the dimwitted in \\"Stupid Girl.\\"  The hard-rocking but danceable \\"Dog new Tricks\\" keeps the album moving along. \\"Garbage\\" saves some of its best songs for last and demonstrates its mastery of pop-craft with the lush \\"My Lovers Box,\\" and \\"Fix Me.\\" Like most Garbage albums, the self-titled debut ends on a morose note with the cheerless \\"Milk,\\" which leaves a lasting feeling.<br /><br />Ten years old, Garbage's self-titled debut album has aged well and sounds as good today as it did back in '95. \\"Garbage\\" stands as one of the finest albums from the 1990s and is an essential cornerstone to add to any modern rock collection. People unfamiliar with Garbage are best served starting off here with the self-titled debut. But Garbage is no one-album-wonder band, and people who like what they hear here are advised to buy \\"Version 2.0,\\" (1998) \\"Beautiful Garbage,\\" (2001) and \\"Bleed Like Me\\" (2005).nt and narcissism of generation X.

B000AV2G3I|5.0|There have been several John Lennon compilations over the years. <br />This is not just his greatest hits but a collection of his best songs. <br />When you have artists who have been around for a long time or who have been very successful, often greatest hits albums leave some of the great songs off. <br />This compilation has a huge collection of songs and nothing I can think of has been left off. <br />December 8th of this year will be the Anniversary of the Death of John Lennon. Yoko is trying to remember his with this CD. <br />If you want Lennons best material or if you just want to discover his music, this would be a great CD to start with. <br />Rest in Peace John
B00005JO1P|5.0|As a die-hard Johnny Cash fan, I had looked forward to this movie for at least a year. After watching the trailers, I was slightly afraid it would be overacted and hard to watch(all the commercial scenes seemed a bit overdramatized, after all), but still had to see this movie.  After watching it, however, I was amazed. It is close to a perfect movie. <br /> <br />Joaquin and Reese really put a lot into their performances. I was skeptical about them doing their own singing when I heard about it, but they did a super job. While they're clearly no Johnny and June, the two's singing fits in perfectly with the movie. Anyway, I was very satisfied with this. It didn't change history to attract viewers, and it didn't breeze over the hard parts of his life. It skipped some things, but that would be necessary for the time limit. A very well-made movie, with plenty of small details thrown in throughout. I recommend it to any Johnny Cash fan, or to anybody, for that matter.
B00004THAY|5.0|For years Clapton and BB King wanted to make a CD together. It took them 30 years but they finally did it, and it was worth the wait. <br />Several songs are covers of songs they have done before on previous albums. Those would include, Ten Long Years, Key to the Highway, Three O\\"Clock Blues and Worried Life Blues. <br />They also do covers of the old Sam and Dave song, Hold on I'm Coming and the class Come Rain or Come Shine. <br />Key to the Highway and Worried Life Blues are done on acoustic guitars, I enjoy hearing them done that way. BB King also writes some new songs for the CD. Unfortunately Clapton writes nothing new. <br />This is a blues fans dream, possibly two of the best blues guitarists ever on the same album and it wont disappoint you.
B00003CX9E|5.0|There are many reasons why this movie comes up on most critics' \\"best films of all time\\" lists. Bottom line is \\"Citizen Kane\\" is a phenomenal piece of film craftsmanship that rewrote all the rules.  Orson Welles, for someone making his first movie, is incredibly ambitious.  He takes all kinds of chances with lighting, camera angles and lenses.  The complexity of the frame within a frame, time splintering story structure has never been duplicated before or since.  Unlike a lot of \\"great\\" films, \\"Kane\\" is also very entertaining--dramatic at times, comic at others, but always filled with detail and invention.  Taking on William Randolph Hearst as a subject may not have been the greatest career move on Welles' part, but it does provide the film with an extra resonance for any American citizen.  Hearst was a great historical figure who had an important role in the shaping of this country.  When you look at the rise of tabloid journalism, attack-style politics, and televised celebrity trials, it's easy to see that his legacy endures.  Also, Kane's obsession with collecting and \\"buying things\\" is especially relevant in our culture of conspicuous consumption.  Like Kane, we all strive to improve our lives through acquiring more stuff, and in the end we are similarly doomed to lose all we have collected.
B000002ULO|4.0|For the first time since Band On The Run Paul has come out with a great album. <br />Paul over the years has wrote a lot of songs that dont even compare to Yesterday or Here, There and Everywhere for instance. <br />Paul has been in a rut since Band On The Run. <br />Paul actually sounds like a Beatle again. Several of these song could actually appear on a Beatle album. <br />Paul shows an acoustic side on this CD. Among those songs are The Song we wer Singing, Somedays, Calico Skies, Lillte Willow and his best acoustic song on the album Great Day. <br />Paul also shows he can still rock with songs like The World Tonight and Young Boy. <br />If you are like me and you hesitate to buy his albums because you have been disappointed too many times, forget it you need to get this one
B000B8QEZG|1.0|The best songs in my opinion are Get Together (because it sounds like vintage Madonna), Future Lovers (the most futuristic song on the album that owes a lot to Donna Summer's I Feel Love), Forbidden Love (yes, it is true Kylie took a lot of ideas from Madonna and on this song Madonna does a reverse), and Sorry (a great bass line from the 70s Jackson). The other songs sound like filters. I do not regret buying this cd...I enjoy it. But while I still listen to Madonna's earlier materials (except for AI)...this album will find its way to my basement in the near future.  <br />
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|As the song says Ravi Shankar came to George and asked for help to relieve the country of Bangla Desh.  <br />Harrison felt he needed to do something so he assembled what is probably the greatest Rock Concert ever. <br />At the time Superstar Concerts had never been done before. <br />As Harrison says in the interviews he had to pass a few obstacles to put the concert on stage. <br />Among the problems were stage fright with Dylan and Eric Clapton and a drug problem. Eric flew into New York about 2 days before the concert and only went to one rehearsal and missed most of it. Clapton managed to play even though he was sick and had to lay down between Concerts. <br />Harrison is in top for throughout, He plays many of his best songs. Dylan performing was also a highlight. <br />With this new release after all these years we finally see Dylan and Harrison singing a duet on If Not For You. <br />You also see Dylan doing a version of Love minus zero/ no limit that was held back from the original release. <br />You also see Leon Russell doing a version of Come On In My Kitchen with Clapton adding lead guitar from a rehearsal. <br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Yes, Madonna loves ABBA, so she begged Benny & Bjorn, & they agreed to let her use the Gimme Gimme Gimme sample.  This has helped Madonna be on top again.  How could she go wrong with the Swedish royalty: ABBA!<br /><br />Hung Up is the best song on the album.  Great job Madonna!  I'm glad she did not try to copy ABBA, but re-invented the song.  After all, she is the queen of re-invention.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY - The rest of the album is full of rehashed Madonna melodies (that sound too much like other songs of hers).  The production is more electronic and disco than ever (as usual it is very creative), but that does not make her melodies fresh.  And Madonna, get rid of Mirwais once and for all --- he is so dated and makes your happy songs sound oppressive at the same time!<br /><br />Yes, her blind fans will totally disagree with this review.  But she should Hang Up on music and stay at home if she is out of melodies, or have someone else write her music (stay out of the writing part Madonna -- use your creative genius in the studio).  Also, using some other backing vocals (than her own) would help give Madonna a freshness that is lacking regardless of the production.  This album is like elevator music to me, and could have been great had the melodies been there.<br /><br />PLEASE DON'T TRY AGAIN MADONNA!
B0009R1T7M|1.0|I had heard raving reviews about this particular cd and the depth of the lyrics and the complexity of instrumentation. So I promptly bought it and listened to the cd fully with a very open musical ear and was astonished. It truly inspired me. I realized that if I wanted to succeed in my own personal career, I must hire a junior high band, downgrade my studio, and write songs that make no sense and I will make it as a professional musician. And I will get raving reviews.<br /><br />The guitars, pianos, banjos, woodwinds were often flat and very unrhythmic. The production was horrible. These are not bad in itself having a low budget. But this thing has soared in popularity. The lyrics that were hyped up as deep were shallow and seemingly unrehearsed and the so-called \\"historisity\\" are bizarre stories that have no application to the listeners. I found no profound lyrics.<br /><br />I understand that to be a revolutionary musician you have to take chances and go with something totally new. This is the one thing about Sufjan Stevens that I admire. He took a risk and some will like it and some will not. It is straight from the 70's though. It is nothing new. It's the same underproduced, cheesy sound that originated from the 70's (not that I throw away those years altogether) but I was not impressed with his venture.<br /><br />I apologize to the die hard fans. Not because I may have offended you, but you have been brainwashed into thinking this is good. I couldn't take 1 album. I wonder what I would do with 50 of them... I hear they make good rifle targets...
B000001GPX|5.0|I hope I won't offend readers and Carlos Kleiber fans by saying what I believe:  this disc of Beethoven Symphonies 5 and 7 by Carlos Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic (recorded in 1975 and 1976) is excellent for both sound and performance, but Karl Bohm's earlier Vienna Philharmonic recording of both works (in 2 different DG 2 disc sets) is superior.<br /><br />Kleiber has a great talent for infusing these works a certain electricity which many listeners find very exciting: a real surface charisma.  But Bohm has a more solid, granite like approach (although not as granite-like as Klemperer/Philharmonia, EMI) which I prefer.  Bohm's tempos are slower than Kleiber's, and he doesn't do anything fancy with dynamics, as Kleiber does in some instances.  Bohm also does not take repeats, which Kleiber does, both in Symphony 5: IV (back to the beginning of IV, the exposition repeat) and in Symphony 7: I, where the flute begins the 6/8 rhythm, the allegro section of the movement.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this:  it's very good.  But I like Bohm/Vienna better, and if you want Carlos Kleiber's Beethoven, check out the Philips DVD of him conducting Beethoven Symphonies 4 and 7 with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in their hall in Amsterdam, a live 1983 concert: great camera work and sound - a beautiful concert video.  The presence of a live, enthusiastic audience likely inspired Kleiber to greater heights, and I prefer the Amsterdam Beethoven 7 over this Vienna recording: faster tempos and more excitement.
B000002UQJ|5.0|I first heard this album a few years ago after cheching it out of my local library. I had never heard it before, and I was very excited to hear how great it was. I was forced to pay many overdue fines for it! I finally got my own copy, and I play it almost every day. Some of my favorite songs ever are on that album. Biker Like an Icon, Off the Ground, Get out of My Way, C'mon People, (which sounds like a solo Hey Jude,) and the \\"hit\\" from the Album, Hope of Deliverance, are some of my all-time favorites. Give it a listen; gaurenteed pleasure for all.
0395389496|5.0|This book means Christmas to me, having left behind childhood long ago this book challenges me to believe in ideas that I gave up long ago. I love this story and for me it stands as the best Christmas story of all time. I'm glad that the movie has delivered it to a whole new generation.
B000BGH22W|5.0|This has to be one of the best soundtracks i've ever listened to.
B000B8QF00|4.0|I must say, I've been anticipating a greatest hits release for some time now.  Just as a way of consolidating some of my CDs that I bought just for one song (soundtracks to City of Angels and Dogma, for example), I couldn't wait for Alanis to release her Collection release.  First, I have every one of her albums, with intensions to purchase her two canadian albums as soon as possible.  She is one of the few artists whose albums I can listen to nearly 90% through without skipping tracks.  I love her lyrics, her music, her humor, and her growth over the years.  Alanis is also one of the few artists whose album I can preorder and not be disappointed with.<br /><br />All that said, I have to admit that I'm slightly disappointed with this release.  First, I didn't realize that \\"So Unsexy\\" was on the cover until others pointed it out.  Although that was never a single but clearly one of her best songs, I'm surprised that such a huge \\"typo\\" was left unnoticed.  Second, I was expecting to see every single she released on this compilation and imagine my surprise that there were 6 singles not accounted for: \\"All I Really Want\\"; \\"Joining You\\"; \\"Unsent\\"; \\"So Pure\\"; \\"Out is Through\\"; and \\"Precious Illusions\\"!  Seeing as I have all of her albums, I'm not too disappointed that these songs were omitted, but to see other songs in their place like \\"Princess Familiar\\" and \\"Simple Together\\" seemed odd to me.  From a commercial standpoint it doesn't make sense to me, but from Alanis's personal standpoint I can understand completely.  Finally, what I was most looking forward to with the greatest hits release was a DVD companion of all her music videos.  Instead, the limited edition has a behind the scenes DVD that, seeing as she's already released two DVDs of backstage footage, I'm so sure was completely necessary.  I always enjoy seeing behind the scenes footage, but I'm a huge fan of music videos and I was really anticipating this release so I could finally get a video compilation from Alanis.  Alas, I will have to continue to wait.<br /><br />On the plus side, I know that she's going to have many more years of incredible music coming our way and that another opportunity to release a video compilation is still on the horizon!from Alanis.  Alas, I will have to continue to wait. <br /> <br />On the plus side, I know that she's going to have many more years of incredible music coming our way and that another opportunity to release a video compilation is still on the horizon!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Come on now didn't we all play cowboys and aliens when we were children? Obviously Joss Whedon did. This movie is a fantastic glimpse of what the original series could have become had it been given the proper time and PR. The powers that be pulled Firefly's plug without even checking it's pulse first. A grave mistake that I can only hope the suits upstairs have noticed and at the very least regret. And it is true that to enjoy this movie there is no need for knowledge of the series. However I think anyone not familiar with the series who sees this movie will be compelled to check out the original. And if you're lucky you may be able to borrow it at your local library, I should know I'm in charge of purchasing DVD's for the library I work in and I bought the series on box set as soon as it was available. It has already been checked out hundreds of times with a spike in circulations when this movie came out. And of all the patrons who have watched it I get the same respone, they all loved it and asked me if we would be buying the movie when it was released. To which I could happily announce that yes we were!
B000929AJQ|4.0|Some reviews on here bash \\"With Teeth\\" for being an even greater departure from \\"The Downward Spiral\\" than \\"The Fragile\\" even was.  It is true that \\"With Teeth\\" has an entirely different, probably more accesible sound than \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or \\"Broken\\" do, but this should not be a bad thing.  In fact all this proves is that Trent is brilliant and is constantly looking for ways to change things up.  If you don't like \\"With Teeth\\", ask yourself, would you really want NIN to put out a \\"The Downward Spiral\\" clone every few years?   <br /> <br />This album has some good songs and some which can be called the strongest in the NIN catalog.  \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" does get repetitive, but it still has a kickass sound.  \\"Only\\" is NIN in the vain of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and is just plain fun to listen to.  The softer, ballad type songs (\\"Right Where It Belongs\\" and \\"Beside You In Time\\") are some of the strongest on the album, with the former being one of NIN's best songs to date.  Also, crank up \\"Love is Not Enough\\" or \\"The Ling Begins to Blur\\" for an awesome experience. <br /> <br />It's true you're not going to find anything like \\"Wish\\" or \\"Ruiner\\" on here, but Trent is all about evolution.  \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" was almost a dance album, \\"Broken\\" was filled with edgy, industrial soaked material, \\"The Downward Spiral\\" has an edge of your seat racous sound, and \\"The Fragile\\" tried to combine the heavy industrial sound with more traditional hook-based song structure.  \\"With Teeth\\" is simply following this tradition, with Trent mixing things up once again.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's hard to pick a favourite/s as this cd rocks!<br /><br />However, I could probably live without Push--the jury is still out on that one.<br /><br />I have been an avid fan for 20 years--she did not disappoint.  Thank God it's not another American Life tragedy!<br /><br />Buy it if you want to boogie--all the tracks have a great beat to them and will surely be big club hits all over the world.
B00097A5HW|3.0|Again, this was a cd that I also had to listen to a couple of times and to tell the truth, I'm sick of it already.  <br /> <br />Good music, good lyrics but nothing to write home about.
B00005NWM3|1.0|It's become somewhat fashionable of late to bash everything within the mainstream, as well as everyone who listens to it. After all, is mainstream music nothing but soulless, factory-assembled tripe churned out for consumption by the uneducated masses? However, one might be tempted to wonder if the mainstream is really all that bad. Surely some bands are popular simply because they are great songwriters and musicians, aren't they? <br /> <br />Then one listens to Nickelback, and is instantly reminded just why the mainstream is so reviled by listeners of \\"real\\" music. <br /> <br />I often criticize electronic music for being soulless, repetitive, and utterly lacking in artistic value, but when it comes to hard rock, Nickelback proves that that genre can be just as bad. NOTHING on \\"Silver Side Up\\" is original. NOTHING shows any sign of creativity; NOTHING shows a band that is willing to experiment creatively or a desire to express themselves artisticly. As another review so eloquently put it, Nickelback doesn't write songs to say anything; they write songs to make hits. <br /> <br />The songs on \\"Silver Side Up\\" are so formulaic, that they could have been generated by a mathematical formula. To such a degree, too, that to describe individual tracks would be folly. \\"Never Again,\\" \\"How You Remind Me,\\" \\"Too Bad,\\"...can anyone remember how these songs differ from one another? Every song sticks to the same tired versus-chorus-verse pattern with the guitars getting heavy in the chorus, lead up to by annoying and cliched \\"chug-chug-chug-chug\\" palm-muted guitar sweeps. Once you've listened to one or two songs off \\"Silver Side Up,\\" you have literally listened to everything Nickelback has to offer in the whole album, and indeed, their entire discography. Their sound, if I could describe it with a single word, would be \\"safe.\\" There's nothing remotely dangerous or experimental; just formulaic Top-30 hard rock designed to chart. And chart their music has. <br /> <br />Lyrically,too, \\"Silver Side Up\\" is cliched beyond cliched. Every song deals with the same tired, unoriginal \\"abused child/broken home/angry man\\" theme that was old ten years ago. Chad \\"I look like Jesus\\" Kroeger tries to come off as menacing and intimidating, but instead sounds only flat and pitiful. \\"Father's a name you haven't earned yet / You're just a child with a temper / Haven't you heard \\"Don't hit a lady\\"? / Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure?\\" Gee Nickelback, it's like someone broke into my house and assaulted me with originality! \\"Silver Side Up\\" features some of the most clumsy, unpoetic, and just plain awful lyrics ever put to paper. There's nothing here that will make you stop and think, I assure you. <br /> <br />\\"Silver Side Up\\", as a CD, is not worth the polycarbonate it's pressed from. Another review described how their radio DJ remarked that \\"Never Again\\", despite it being a \\"serious\\" song, sounded funny. You know what's funny? Nickelback five years from now. Now THAT'S funny.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I'm not a big fan of broadway shows and its not so much that I dislike musicals as much as I hate spending a ludicrous amount of money for a two hour show...  <br /> <br />But Idina Menzel was what made Wicked \\"Wicked\\".... Amazing scenery, staging and it was very clever but definitely to me, Idina was the show... I couldn't deal with Glinda's voice..too high pitched and annoying for me.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|The dual nature of Gene Wilder's performance in the original made his character exciting and mysterious.  Depp's Willy is just weird and shallow.  Michael Jackson meets Edward Scissor-Hands.  It was a waste of a great actor. <br /> <br />In the original, the Oompa's were also compelling.  They could turn from fun-loving and non-threatening to dark and menacing with the flick of a cane.  Everyone wanted to see more of them.  Unfortunately Burton took this literally and made hundreds of clones.  It seems like he was so distracted (as I was) with the split screens, scaling, modeling and other Hollywood trickery, that he forgot all about personality.  I'm so bored of directors tripping over special effects that I can only say \\"Please God, don't let him near Disney.  I don't want to see Snow White and the 700 Sleepy's\\". <br /> <br />In the original it felt like the kids had a fair chance, but they fell victims to their own vices.  In Burton's, it felt more like target practice.  Hand the gum chewer a piece of gum and when she starts chewing it, act... unsure.  The only moral there was don't take candy from strange people. <br /> <br />Of course this version is going to be compared to the original version, and I think the time spent watching this would have been better spent watching the original.  After viewing this once, I've seen all I'll ever want to of Weird Willy Rubber-Hands Wonka, his special effects factory, and his Oompa.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|The first time I saw Office Space, a few years ago, I thought it was not bad, but nothing all that special either.  I must have watched it at least 10 times since then though, and each time I like it more.  Now I'd describe it as a comic masterpiece.  I love what they've done with the music, and many of the less visible characters, such as Lawrence the neighbor, are hilarious.  I absolutely love all the characters in this movie, with the exception of the stapler guy, whose meek and mumbly humor I still haven't managed to appreciate yet.  I think what makes this movie really extaordinary though is that it does such a great job of parodying the ridiculous aspects of the office environment.  As outrageous as much of the material is, it really hits home with the millions who have suffered through similarly stupid situations at their own work.  Not good for young kids due to some language, I'd recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a good laugh.
0689835604|5.0|One of my and the kid's favorite books. It's durable and easy to read, with beautiful colors and clear illustrations. A great book for reading simply and interacting in quality time. I can't imagine a 1-4 yr old not enjoying this book.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|If you're already a Bob Dylan fan, or even just like a few of his early songs, then you will find much to appreciate in this documentary.  Even if you just like to watch a well-made documentary once in a while, and couldn't care less about Dylan, I'd recommend that you check this out.  I'd seen some other films on Dylan before and thought they were pretty good.  This one is the best I've seen so far.  I like the coverage it gives to his early influences and I was really impressed by how open and revealing he seemed in many of the interview clips.
0694003611|5.0|There is something so classic and sweet about this book, from the illustrations to the words. It's one of those books that I want to read to my kids and someday read to grandkids. And a book that I think most people should own.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Definitely a movie to be watched again and again, each time finding new peculiar moments to laugh about and make you wonder.  In my opinion this is among the very best of the Coen Brother's collection of films.  There is something about a bowling theme that just lends itself to ourtrageously good comedy.  Probably not a good choice for young kids due to language, and afterall the dude is not the most productive role model for the financially measured well-being standards of 21st century America.  The dude is above and beyond all that.  I recommend this film to anyone who likes quirkiness, twisted comedy, bowling, or any of the Coen brother's movies.
0688145078|4.0|We read this book before and after our son's baby sister arrived. It really addresses the ideas that new siblings face. The baby requires so much more attention for its basic needs and everyone seems drawn to a new baby. But there are So many things that an older sibling can do, that a baby can't. And that means he/she is still important and special and can even help out in caring for the new baby.<br /><br />A good book, one of the better ones that I've found on the being a big brother after the baby is born.
B000005JSK|5.0|This is an incredible album from Faith No More.  The two disc import is the ultimate version to own.  Disc one includes all the tracks from the regular version, plus Easy (studio version).  Disc two includes Easy (live), Be Aggressive (live), Kindergarten (live), and Mark Bowen (live).

Not only do you feel the words deep in your heart, but the ending, the next page... nothing is certain and it doesn't matter if you've read Mrs. Dolloway or not, it's simply a great read.<br /><br />This is a book that my grandma and friends read, then encouraged me to read. I loved it.

It is too bad she sounds so \\"stuck on herself\\" with style and arrangements. \\"Holiday Songs\\" should have been the title, since Wally World, Sears, Circuit City and Target are saying Nyet to the \\"C\\" word this year. It was so lackluster...I am wrapping up for my son as a gift...just need an explanation for the missing Shrink wrap! I am disappointed...and most of us fans who are waiting for the next \\"fresh\\" DK cd, will be too!

B0007OCG56|4.0|This unusual film is surprisingly entertaining, much more interesting than its advertising would suggest. The story is a familiar one, need vs. plenty, as a young mother and her daughter emigrate from Mexico, crossing the border illegally in hopes of a better life. Flor (Paz Vega) is hired to work as a domestic in a wealthy household, although she speaks not a word of English. John Clasky (Adam Sandler) is an award-winning chef, who provides a lifestyle for his wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni) and daughter that includes a Malibu beach house for the summer. Flor is induced to live at the Malibu home and care for the family when it is suggested that her daughter, Christina (Victoria Luna) come along. Flor finds her parenting challenged at every point by a spoiled and insensitive Deborah, a self-centered fitness junkie with a penchant for talking her family into submission.<br /><br />Without a trace of subtlety, Deborah confronts her daughter's weight problem, under the guise of what is best for the girl, her husband chagrined by his wife's lack of sensitivity, but basically ineffective in the family dynamic. Turning to the lively and lovely Christina, Deborah smothers the child with opportunities that would otherwise be denied her, Deborah oblivious to anyone's needs but her own. Frustrated and hampered by the language barrier, understanding instinctively that she will need every tool available to offset Christina's growing ease with privilege and access, Flor takes a crash course in English. A determined Flor fights for her own territory and in the process wins the affection of the largely ignored John. Meanwhile Deborah pursues her own interests at the risk of her happy, if dysfunctional home. It would be easy to imagine the outcome of this domestic drama, but director James L. Brooks avoids the predictable, delivering a thought-provoking ending that gives a welcome twist to the immigrant issue.<br /><br />Paz Vega (Flor) and Victoria Luna (Christina) provide the emotional core of this film, with engaging support from Sandler and Sarah Steele, as his daughter, Bernice. Vega shines on the screen, her acting a luminous antidote to the over-the-top Leoni, who ties herself into such an emotional knot that she becomes a parody of the self-indulgent over-privileged. For all her emotional gymnastics, Leoni never comes close to Vega, whose role is all the more powerful for its understatement.

B000002KHB|5.0|Machine Head (1972.), Deep Purple's sixth studio album<br /><br />Deep Purple are one of the all time great classic rock acts, and sadly probably one of the most underrated. After a relatively obscure start, producing 3 albums in the late 1960's which were good but sadly commercial failures, the band changed its line up. From here, the classic MK2 line-up of Ian Gillan (vocals), Richie Blackmore (lead guitar), Roger Glover (bass), John Lord (keyboards) and Ian Paice (drums) strung together a number of great albums. The first was 'In Rock', a bit raw but a masterpiece none the less and the second was 1971's 'Fireball', a bit experimental but thoroughly classic Deep Purple. Following this, the band went to Montreux in Switzerland (for tax exemption purposes) to cut their next studio album. However, tragedy struck when the band's proposed recording spot burnt down in a Frank Zappa show. Undeterred however, the band set up a place to record in the Grand Hotel at Montreux and put together the songs that would make up the 'Machine Head' album. Since then, 'Machine Head' has grown to be Deep Purple's most praised and popular album. This afterall is the album which features 'THE riff' in 'Smoke On The Water'. So how good does this album turn out to be?<br /><br />Deep Purple's 'Machine Head' deserves all of the respect it gets, it is a masterpiece of an album. Eventhough this is not my favourite Deep Purple album ('Fireball' pips it at the post IMO) there is no denying that this album features the band at their technical best and their most fluent. The quality of this album is all the more remarkable given that the band had to record the whole thing in a Hotel corridor and to pull off a near perfect album speaks volumes for the band's ability. Since the album's release, it has gone on to be remebered most of all as the work that features 'Smoke On The Water', the song with perhaps the most famous riff of all time, known even to those who aren't into rock. However, in many ways this is an unfair reflection on the album as all 7 tracks are great. I think personally that 'Smoke On The Water' is matched by songs like 'Lazy' and is probably bettered by 'Highway Star' and 'Space Truckin'. The album is THAT good! The album is catchy, without being inherantly commercial. Indeed there is plenty of complex stuff on here; the riffing is fast and inspired at times and the keyboard blended sound is something special. All of the band give stellar performances. Ian Gillan's vocals have their usual unique style to them and he gives a diverse performance. Richie Blackmore's riffing is great and his solos are effortlessly executed in style. Roger Glover's strong bass play adds that extra heaviness to the music and John Lord's nifty work on the Hammond organ gives the unique Deep Purple sound. Ian Paice's drumming is fast, complex and rhythm perfect; he is definitely the most UNDERRATED drummer of all time and is up there with the best. All in all, 'Machine Head' features the band at their peak producing timeless hard rock songs that have become influences for plenty of bands to follow - and at the same time the music has that uplifting 'good time' feel to it!<br /><br />Currently you can obtain the 'Machine Head' album in two versions. The first is the standard album remaster featuring the original remaster. No fuss there, your getting a classic album anyway. However, if you want to pay out the extra cash, get the anniversary edition which features a complete new sounding master of the album, with extended sections to the songs and a bonus out-take track in 'When A Blind Man Cries' which is a bluesy styled, slow track which develops into a heartfelt performance from the band.<br /><br />The 'Machine Head' juggernaut kicks off with one of the band's great songs. 'Highway Star' is a fast paced rocker with a very metal sound to it ... trust me, my friends, speed metal has its roots in songs like this! Gillan aggressively flies though the vocals like a manpossessed alongside plenty of racing guitar sections from Blackmore. This is the way to start an album! 'Maybe I'm A leo' follows, a great song although it's the weakest on this very high standard album. The riffing again is great and inspired. 'Pictures Of Home' is another brisk rocking song, with Gillan singing on a theme of longing for your homelands. Next is one of the more catchy songs on the album in 'Never Before'. The band really thought this would be their biggest hit off the album and released it as a single. Obviously it became overshadowed. Its a brilliant song though, with a funky keyboard solo from Lord with some creative drumming. Again the riff is timeless.<br /><br />The second half opens up with the famous track on the album. What a riff Richie Blackmore stumbled on here; 'Smoke On The Water' is deservedly famous; its an awesome song. The lyrics are based on the theme of the fire at the Frank Zappa show and Gillan executes them fantastically. Blackmore jams out another great solo and Lord's keyboard undertones are inspired throughout, as they are also in the next track 'Lazy'. This 7 minute masterpiece is the most underrated song on the album. Another dramatised keyboard opener sets the tone for a classy track which is a real driving song. Gillans laid back vocals with harmonica alongside make this track a great one. Richie Blackmore's guitar sections are the ultimate technical perfection on this song. Finally though, we come to 'Space Truckin''. This is my favourite track on the album. The song has so much energy and fire. The grinding descending riff with bass is awesome and Gillan's growling vocals, with lyrics about completely random things such as 'Music In The Solar System' make this one a classic. Especially great is the instrumental section on the song where Ian Paice plays a mind-blowing drum solo; I'll say it again, he is the most underrated drummer of all time. What a song!<br /><br />'Machine Head' is a landmark album. Deep Purple completely refined their hard rocking, keyboard driven sound to come up with a collection of songs that really deliver. Best of all, the album is always enjoyable to listen to and you never get bored of the songs. Although it's not my favourite DP album, it is many ways, their most perfected work and shows the band at their peak. For any newbie to the band, get this album as it is a perfect introduction. Deep Purple are one of the most underrated bands of all time and they deserve much more respect than they get. Amazingly enough, this band are still together after 37 years (now into their 8th line-up) and are still producing great music (just look at their recent 'Rapture Of The Deep' album). Deep Purple are one of the greats and their music is influential, timeless and unbelievably memorable.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10acing guitar sections from Blackmore.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a welcome return to form for Madonna.  Although, Madonna never quite repeats herself and this dance music is layered with lots of trance, electronica, and other Euro influences. It's a perfect blend of 1970s, 1980s, and today.  If \\"Hung Up\\" doesn't immediately grab you (and radio is finally catching on - it's at #14 on Hot 100 this week with a bullet, up from #27) you might want to check your pulse! It's almost impossible not to dance to this track.  The rest of the album is not exactly non-stop dance music. There are a variety of tempos (all upbeat) and themes.  While some of the tunes do blend together a bit musically, \\"Push\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"How High\\" are all standouts.  And \\"I Love New York\\" - with its brash punk spirit and silly/fun rhymes - is enough to make anyone fall in love with Madonna all over again.
B00000DWHH|5.0|Who's Next (1971.), the Who's fifth studio album<br /><br />The rock powerhouse that is the Who are rightly regarded as one of the great band's that has ever existed. From the moment that the band came on to the scene in the mid-1960's, it almost seemed pre-ordained that this band was going to be destined for great things. If the timeless classic song of 'My Generation' wasn't proof enough, the band went onto build up a number of other great songs and concept based works in the late 60's, culminating in Pete Townshend's mastermind project in 'Tommy'. With the 70's then rolling around, Pete Townshend set upon the task of putting together some more material. This came about in the shape of the 'Lifehouse' project. Sadly though, this fell apart causing problems for the band. However, from the ashes of the project, a new studio album was cut in early 1971. 'Who's Next' is regarded as a hard rock classic by many fans of the band, and perhaps as the Who's greatest album. So is it deserving of its great reputation?<br /><br />'Who's Next' will always be for me, one of the greatest albums that has ever been made. I loved it when I first listened to it and I haven't tired of it ever since. This is literally an awesome album and I think that it is pathetic that this albums overall rating has dropped to 4.5 stars on this site; whoever's been giving this album a low rating to pull its average down obviously has no decent music taste at all. It is quite hard to believe some of these songs were destined for the `Lifehouse' project since the nine tracks on the album are completely unrelated rock songs; a singer-songwriter album. However, this is where `Who's Next' really succeeds, becauses each and every one of the tracks holds up on their own and are in their own right all awesome songs. The album never has a weak moment and covers dramatic scope be it from the Irish-themed rocker `Baba O'Riley' to the lyrical perferction of `Behind Blue Eyes' or to the sheer epic scale of `Won't Get Fooled Again'. Some of the Who's best work is featured on this album and for me it's the best album they made. Instrumentally, the band are also at their very best on the album, and the work is cohesive and brilliantly executed. Townshend's trademark guitar play features throughout as does the sheer power of Roger Daltrey's voice. John Entwhistle shows his diversity with fluid bass lines, French horn play and with a bit of songwriting in `My Wife' and Keith Moon's god-like drumming is probably at its best on this album; some of the beats and drum passages are simply breathtaking.<br /><br />`Who's Next' is available in a number of different editions, due to occasional remasters and such. The most readily available version is the single CD bonus tracks edition. This is the version I originally purchased and it contains the original 9 album tracks plus 7 bonus tracks. Some of these extras are great songs, especially the alternative take of `Behind Blue Eyes', `Pure And Easy' and the live performance of `Water'. However, if your willing to shell out more cash on this album, the `Who's Next' deluxe edition is available. This double CD set features the original album, session out-takes and alternatives and a complete CD with a live performance from the Young Vic featuring plenty of songs from this album. All in all, you can't go wrong with either edition of this classic album, it just depends on how much your willing to spend.<br /><br />So how does each song on the album measure up? `Baba O'Riley' is one hell of an opening track; one of my favourite album opening tracks of all time. The racy keyboard theme opening the album is legendary and follows into some crushing guitar chords from Townshend's guitar. Daltrey's vocals are powerful, especially his screams of `Teenage Wasteland!' and the Irish jig styled finish to the song builds to a great climax. `Bargain' is an excellent follow up; a laid back start builds into another great rock song with more vintage guitarplay from Townshend. The song has plenty of intense sections, beautifully contrasted by a brief acoustic section in the middle. `Love Ain't For Keeping' is next; a short acoustic based song to break up the longer songs on the album which is a great listen. `My Wife' is the amusing follow up. This is probably the best song John Entwhistle wrote whilst in the Who. Its an amazingly catchy song with some funny lyrics and great guitar play. Entwhistle's songs, like this one especially always have that quirky aspect to them and they're always a great listen. `The Song Is Over' closes the first half of the album. Many have criticized this slow-tempo song but I personally think it's a great song. The piano harmony is beautiful and the vocals, this time sung by Townshend, are great. As the song progresses, it gets more guitar pronounced, making a good build-up.<br /><br />`Getting In Tune' opens up the album's second half. Another classic rocking song with a nice piano integration. Some of Townshend's guitar play at the end of the track is very creative. The upbeat `Goin Mobile' follows, where Daltrey gives a great vocal performance singing about roaming the land without a care. More great guitar sections on this song. Then we come to two of the Who's greatest songs. First is `Behind Blue Eyes' with its beautiful opening acoustic section and yearning verse. The chorus is brilliant where the song takes a more aggressive and punchy turn and the lyrics have a harsh edge to them. Following this is my favourite Who song of all time. People don't praise `Won't Get Fooled Again' for nothing, this is the band's epic and was their classic concert close thereon. The punchy electric keyboard sounds fused with Townshend's deftly executed but loud guitar play are the perfect base for Daltrey's inspired vocals, with lyrics based on revolution. Townshend jams out some great solos throughout the song and Keith Moon plays some thrilling drumming sections, especially where the band begin a surprise heavy re-entry at the end of the track. The end of the song, were Daltrey shouts `Meet The New Boss; Same As The Old Boss!'  over crunching guitars marks an emphatic finish to a great album.<br /><br />`Who's Next' is one of the greatest albums of all time. With this album, the Who hit the mark totally producing a set of truly memorable and hard-rocking songs. This, on the back of a failed musical project in `Lifehouse' just shows how musically talented the band were, that they could quickly churn out this classic. No rock collection is complete without this masterpiece; it is an essential buy and definitely the perfect place for someone looking to start listening to the Who.<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10, a classic that rises above the rests plenty of intense sections, beautifully contrasted by a brief acoustic section in the middle. `Love Ain't For Keeping' is next; a short acoustic based song to break up the longer songs on the album which is a great listen. `My Wife' is the amusing follow up.

B000BO0LLS|5.0|I give 5 stars to this album because, Mariah Carey -  one of the biggest voices in the world - with her incredible talent, has proved that she could rule the charts again, putting two songs on the top of the billboard charts with the smash hit ''We belong together'' - #1 AND AT THE SAME TIME \\"Shake it off'' #2. <br />Not mentioning that she's astonishing pretty. <br />The album is amazing, and as she said, this album is a ''thank you to her fans''. If you don't have any versions of the album, you should definitely get this one. Or if you do have the first edition and love mariah you'll certainly love this new edition! <br />Don't pay attention to this stupid J-lo fans. First of all, the title of her (J.lo) album  couldn't be more apropriated, she really needs to REBIRTH to do something that could be at least listenable. At first, she was an actress (a mediocre one), and now she's doing ''music'' AND movies, trying to survive somehow. She was not born to sing, or to anything else. She's insane to put out this garbage and pretend she is a singer! PLEASE!  <br />And it's really anoying to see this bunch of blind fans trying to convince people to buy the failure of the year! Oh, I forgot! She really need this whole support to sell albums.

Entwhistle's songs, like this one especially always have that quirky aspect to them and they're always a great listen. `The Song Is Over' closes the first half of the album.

The chorus is brilliant where the song takes a more aggressive and punchy turn and the lyrics have a harsh edge to them. Following this is my favourite Who song of all time. People don't praise `Won't Get Fooled Again' for nothing, this is the band's epic and was their classic concert close thereon. The punchy electric keyboard sounds fused with Townshend's deftly executed but loud guitar play are the perfect base for Daltrey's inspired vocals, with lyrics based on revolution. Townshend jams out some great solos throughout the song and Keith Moon plays some thrilling drumming sections, especially where the band begin a surprise heavy re-entry at the end of thetrack.

B00008LOS1|5.0|Who's Next (1971.), the Who's fifth studio album<br /><br />The rock powerhouse that is the Who are rightly regarded as one of the great band's that has ever existed. From the moment that the band came on to the scene in the mid-1960's, it almost seemed pre-ordained that this band was going to be destined for great things. If the timeless classic song of 'My Generation' wasn't proof enough, the band went onto build up a number of other great songs and concept based works in the late 60's, culminating in Pete Townshend's mastermind project in 'Tommy'. With the 70's then rolling around, Pete Townshend set upon the task of putting together some more material. This came about in the shape of the 'Lifehouse' project. Sadly though, this fell apart causing problems for the band. However, from the ashes of the project, a new studio album was cut in early 1971. 'Who's Next' is regarded as a hard rock classic by many fans of the band, and perhaps as the Who's greatest album. So is it deserving of its great reputation?<br /><br />'Who's Next' will always be for me, one of the greatest albums that has ever been made. I loved it when I first listened to it and I haven't tired of it ever since. This is literally an awesome album and I think that it is pathetic that this albums overall rating has dropped to 4.5 stars on this site; whoever's been giving this album a low rating to pull its average down obviously has no decent music taste at all. It is quite hard to believe some of these songs were destined for the `Lifehouse' project since the nine tracks on the album are completely unrelated rock songs; a singer-songwriter album. However, this is where `Who's Next' really succeeds, becauses each and every one of the tracks holds up on their own and are in their own right all awesome songs. The album never has a weak moment and covers dramatic scope be it from the Irish-themed rocker `Baba O'Riley' to the lyrical perferction of `Behind Blue Eyes' or to the sheer epic scale of `Won't Get Fooled Again'. Some of the Who's best work is featured on this album and for me it's the best album they made. Instrumentally, the band are also at their very best on the album, and the work is cohesive and brilliantly executed. Townshend's trademark guitar play features throughout as does the sheer power of Roger Daltrey's voice. John Entwhistle shows his diversity with fluid bass lines, French horn play and with a bit of songwriting in `My Wife' and Keith Moon's god-like drumming is probably at its best on this album; some of the beats and drum passages are simply breathtaking.<br /><br />`Who's Next' is available in a number of different editions, due to occasional remasters and such. The most readily available version is the single CD bonus tracks edition. This is the version I originally purchased and it contains the original 9 album tracks plus 7 bonus tracks. Some of these extras are great songs, especially the alternative take of `Behind Blue Eyes', `Pure And Easy' and the live performance of `Water'. However, if your willing to shell out more cash on this album, the `Who's Next' deluxe edition is available. This double CD set features the original album, session out-takes and alternatives and a complete CD with a live performance from the Young Vic featuring plenty of songs from this album. All in all, you can't go wrong with either edition of this classic album, it just depends on how much your willing to spend.<br /><br />So how does each song on the album measure up? `Baba O'Riley' is one hell of an opening track; one of my favourite album opening tracks of all time. The racy keyboard theme opening the album is legendary and follows into some crushing guitar chords from Townshend's guitar. Daltrey's vocals are powerful, especially his screams of `Teenage Wasteland!' and the Irish jig styled finish to the song builds to a great climax. `Bargain' is an excellent follow up; a laid back start builds into another great rock song with more vintage guitarplay from Townshend. The song has plenty of intense sections, beautifully contrasted by a brief acoustic section in the middle. `Love Ain't For Keeping' is next; a short acoustic based song to break up the longer songs on the album which is a great listen. `My Wife' is the amusing follow up. This is probably the best song John Entwhistle wrote whilst in the Who. Its an amazingly catchy song with some funny lyrics and great guitar play. Entwhistle's songs, like this one especially always have that quirky aspect to them and they're always a great listen. `The Song Is Over' closes the first half of the album.

0451191153|5.0|I originally bought this book about ten years ago, but recently re-read it after reading a new techno-thriller that had a number of similarities to Rand's work.  <br /> <br />The ideas expressed in The Fountainhead are less about selfishness and more about how hard it is to have integrity in a society of parasites. The contrast between  Roark and the second handers -- people who blame society for their shortcomings rather than make any attempt to control their destiny -- is timeless. <br /> <br />I believe people should read this book and then take a good look around them; they'll suddenly see the world in a whole new light. I would also suggest that anyone looking for something new with the same independent, objective and libertarian feel would do well to check out 3000 Years by Richard Mgrdechian. Although a little technical at times (sort of like a Michael Crichton book), it does cover many the same themes as Rand but in a new and very different way. <br />

0783116934|1.0|i think the movie is very weird for a few reasons. First the whole thing is happening in Russia, but the movie is in english language the ameriacn actors and actreses are made to speak english with a heavy russian accent, and they are not very good at it, i had to run subtitles thru the entire movie. even the fact that i am from the former soviet union myself and i understand russian did not help at all. it is really weird to see Donald Sutherland trying to speak english with an accent. Also they overuse the word \\"comrade\\", it was never used in everyday communication, it is not a casual word. Also ppls outfits and some other facts are faked and made up. I never finished watching it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|All my life I've heard Beatles music through oldies radio. This album has all songs you need from this group instead of buying cd's just to hear a particular song. 27 songs on CD for a cheap price is something worth buying. Unlike the other CD's who have this much music which sells way more. All though I wouldn't go crazy and buy all thier cd's but if I were to have one Beatle album, this one would be it. I've liked all the Beatle songs I've heard but the wierd one was the Number 9. I heard it during my Rock N' Roll class, and though that that was the wierdest thing I ever heard. Other than that, this is a must have!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is amazing, all dance music, a real guilty pleasure. <br />Madonna releases one of the best albums of her career after the ill received (unjustly) American Life. <br />Songs like Hung Up, Sorry,and Push will have this album on the top for a long time. <br />Welcome back!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Gdula reports on music regularly for [...]    Madonna's new CD drops this week and it feels like old times. In fact, there's such a palpable vibe that the release of Confessions on a Dance Floor has all the festive energy of an event. It feels familiar and celebratory. It feels like-go ahead and gag now because you knew this was coming-a holiday, albeit one we haven't observed in a long time.     In the beginning, back in the 1980s and even the early 1990s, the release of a new Madonna video or single was akin to a national holiday, at least among her gay fans. The devotion, the urgency, and the fervor with which we rushed to buy her music, set the VCRs to record her every appearance, and raced to the newsstand to pour over the Vogue and Vanity Fair spreads became nearly ritualistic. Whether documented by Herb Ritts or Steven Meisel, we anticipated each new incarnation of our Madonna like pilgrims waiting for a vision.     We couldn't get enough. We had it bad for the Material Girl-and she gave it to us good.     When she enjoined, \\"Everybody, come on, dance and sing,\\" we got up and did our thing. When she coaxed us to \\"Live out your fantasies here with me,\\" we let the music set us free, and we partied with abandon. When she admonished us, \\"Don't go for second best,\\" we put our lovers to the test and stood our ground.     Madonna was a new kind of heroine for the diva-adoring gay masses. The tone of the torch songs that characterized the pre-disco era was long on suffering, short on self-worth. Madonna gave us a new kind of anthem, one in which we no longer had to be held hostage emotionally by anyone who spurned our advances. She went beyond telling us that we would we survive; she told us we could do so without compromising ourselves or our desires. The \\"respect/ express yourself\\" message in Madonna's lyrics, when teamed with her own unabashed sexuality and walloping down beats, was the new kind of kick we'd been looking for.     We were smitten, and Madonna justified our love for her by always lifting us out of the realm of the day-to-day. Her music could transform an ordinary minute into an immortal club moment, complete with a shimmering disco ball and dizzying flecks of light. Madonna's dance tracks offered a necessary escape that was nearly transcendental during an era when our community was seeing more than its share of heartbreak and horror.     Off the dance floor, she was just as supportive, becoming an outspoken AIDS activist and promoting education and compassion over ignorance and intolerance. At a time when other artists tried to distance themselves from the very audience that helped their stars to rise, Madonna only turned the light back on her gay fans and made it burn all the brighter. After \\"Vogue\\"-and its obvious debt to to the gay drag artists depicted in Jennie Livingston's documentary, Paris Is Burning-some critics would say her sidling up to the gay community had always been in her best interest.     But the relationship between Madonna and her gay fans over the years was one of mutual adoration at best, symbiosis at worst. We understood the impulses that led to some of her less-than-stellar moments and we looked the other way. She had Dennis Rodman. We had Rod and Bob Paris-Jackson. As long as she delivered what we came to expect-a soundtrack that gave us hope and allowed us, in our more somber moments, to believe that there was a place where we could be better than we were today-we continued our devotion.     By the end of the 1990s things had started to change, though, and it was Madonna herself who foreshadowed the shift. When she covered Don McLean's folk epic \\"American Pie\\" in 2000 for The Next Best Thing sound track, hearing her sing the lines \\"I knew if I had my chance / that I could make those people dance / and maybe they'd be happy for a while,\\" it was hard not to be struck by the earnestness of her delivery. As she did with everything else, she made the lyrics her own. As a listener, not tomention a fan, you almost wanted to put any doubts she might have had to rest. Yes, Madonna you did make those people dance. And yes, you certainly did make us happy, and for more than just awhile. You made us downright ecstatic for many, many years. Your music continued to transport us out of this world and into another.     But for some fans the moment Madonna began talking about another type of transcendence-through the teachings of Kabbalah-was the day the music died.     In the mid to late 1990s, there was still plenty of life in Madonna's work, depending on who was taking the pulse. The problem, as some devotees saw it, was the message that accompanied the medium. Both the CD and the title song of 1997's Ray of Light could easily have been sub-titled Meditations on a Dance Floor. The song's lyrics contained a different kind of spiritual exploration than that to which Madonna's fans were accustomed. Whereas she had previously questioned religious authority-in Gaultier-designed frocks, no less-she was now turning inward and searching for answers.     Some fans didn't care, as long as she still brought the beats to the dance floor, and Music, released in 2000, delivered some block-rockers. Still, the lyrics and attitude that had earlier in her career made the press label her a \\"stainless steel sexual icon\\" were not the focus of this later work. Eventually the spirituality-cum-social message that culminated in her American Life release and last summer's Reinvention Tour left part of her audience feeling abandoned. Madonna may have only wanted to take her fans higher with her musings on the immaterial world. But as an escape it just wasn't where some of them wanted to go.     Finding God, reaching Nirvana, becoming born again, seeking a balanced center-whichever way you choose to label it, a spiritual search is an individual thing. But getting dumped? Now that's universal. After we spent hours waiting for the call that never came, it was Madonna who told us to usethat dejection to our advantage. Rejection, we learned, was a powerful aphrodisiac, and looking good was the best revenge.     And that's probably part of the reason her new single, \\"Hung Up,\\" has created such excitement: Madonna is back on message. Madonna is once again singing from a place where we've all been, with attitude and beats most definitely included.     \\"Hung Up\\" had barely had its legal release when my in-box began filling with the effusive ravings of the faithful. What struck me the most wasn't just the adoration and excitement that the new single had stirred among my friends; it was the song's uncanny ability to allow these people to forget the very real problems they had to face each day.     D, who said he'd \\"nearly swerved off the road\\" when he'd heard \\"Hung Up\\" while driving, has been tending to the health of a gravely ill family member for most of the year.     S, whose excitement over Madonna's new single was displayed in exclamation points and gasp-filled messages, has been diagnosed with a cardiac condition generally associated with people twice his age.     And M, who had just undergone yet another surgery for a chronic autoimmune disorder, was particularly happy; \\"Hung Up,\\" with its revved-up ABBA sample and bone-crushing beats, took him back to the dance floor and distracted him from his post-op pain.     The appearance of Madonna on MTV's European Music Video Awards show caused another volley of e-mails and phone calls as the reverent frantically programmed their TiVos. After repeated viewings, we gushed about the boots, the body, and the magnetic presence. We might as well have been worlds away.     The problems we have today are different than those we faced 20 or so years ago but regardless of the issue currently laying us low, Madonna still lifts us up the most whenever she's throwing down. One day we might be ready to sit and listen more attentively to what the Kabbalah can bring to our lives, but with one version of Confessions on aDance Floor offering seamless mixes from one track to the next it doesn't look like we'll be getting off the dance floor anytime soon.     So, Happy Madonna Day. It's time for the good times. Forget about the-never mind, I think you know the rest.
0812550706|4.0|I found this to be a very enjoyable novel. It's not got the grand weirdness of Dune. Nor is it as telling about our contemporary world as Oryx and Crake. But it's a fine novel that sits firmly in the sci-fi tradition. I did find Ender sympathetic and his training, strategies, and tactics all interesting to read about.<br /><br />I must admit that the ending surprised me. I'm not going to give it away, but the main drama of the novel comes to you unexpectedly. For me, I got it just a few lines before it was revealed, and that was a joy. Card did a fine job of writing a clever, thoughtful and thought-provoking novel.<br /><br />In terms of criticism... It is hard to actually imagine Ender as being six, seven, eight years old, etc. He's not like a kid in almost any way. And his similarly gifted peers also don't seem to fit their ages. They all read more like very intelligent seventeen year olds who just happen to also be asexual. But while I feel this way I don't think it matters much. All stories require a suspension of disbelief. That's the only way you're going to enjoy them. Some people just aren't willing to do that for certain books at certain times in their life. There's a review a few down from this one in which the person hated everything about the book. I'm convinced, however, that she missed the point on each and every issue. She chose not to suspend belief and enjoy. If you make a choice like that any novel can suck.<br /><br />This one, honestly, doesn't suck. Young or old, fan of sci-fi or new to it: give this novel a try. It's likely you'll like it.
B0006L5RT2|3.0|No, it definetely doesn't sound like The Doors! James Blunt's \\"Back to Bedlam\\" reminds me more of Daniel Powter, Keane or even Coldplay... melancholy in the lyrics and in the sound of almost every single track...  <br />I just wanted to point out to Ingeborg from Norway, who has written a very useful review explaining all tracks one by one, that in my opinion track 7 \\"So long Jimmy\\" is entirely dedicated to Jim Morrison and not to a friend of James Blunt who has passed away... The lyrics tell so much about someone who made great songs and who didn't live long, and in the end of the song we can hear a bit of \\"Riders on the storm\\" sounds... absolutely great! <br />What makes me think too that James' face on the cover looks so very much like Jimmy Morrison's! The first time I saw this album in a shop I thought it was an album of The Doors! <br />A tribute to Jim Morrison? <br />
B00003CXQY|5.0|I love this movie I have seen it like a million times. I am always quoting lines from it. It is a great movie!!!
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Excellent film.  I actually finished watching this film with family, and instead of us picking another film to finish the day, we all decided to watch this one again.  I can't think of any other films (maybe the original Matrix), that we would have done that for.  Great film. <br />
0792840461|5.0|All the kudos usually goes to Bullit, released the same year, yet with this movie, McQueen, the King of Cool, comes of age as an actor, at the height of his power as the No.1 Box office Hollywood star. Commonly regarded by critics as a triumph of style over substance, Jewison crafted a movie for the age and drew from McQueen the kind of performance of which few thought him capable. True, Dunaway's outfits (and Burke's hats) do cement the movie pretty firmly into its time period but anyone coming new to this movie who wasn't around at the time it was made has ample compensation in the luminosity of the stars, the fabulous jazz inspired Michel Legrand soundtrack, a gem of a performance from Jack Weston, as Erwin, and the famous chess game scene. Through the filter of McQueen's performance in the movie, picturing Brosnan as Crown in the recent remake is even more ludicrous than trying to picture Alec Baldwin as Doc McCoy: watch out for the scene in which Crown sets the 'ball rolling' by phoning up the members of the 'gang' he's hired to carry out the heist and then reflect on the observational skills of his detractors. His acting in this movie was matched only by that of his performances later in Papillon and the Getaway. Ultimately, the movie has stood the test of time and will continue to be watched long after DVDs of the Brosnan remake are gathering dust, deservedly, on the shelves of charity shops up and down the country.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|The worse Album of the Year..Hyped for that \\"first week\\" sales boom, but it will quickly go BUST..not after she is trumped by an american idol of course..Hung Up is a good song, however, she just lost a plagarism lawsuit, so hopefully ABBA doesnt follow suit..
0452282152|4.0|Using a famous yet enigmatic painting as the basis for a well-imagined story, the author writes in elegant and brilliantly understated prose that perfectly evokes the period she so effortlessly describes. The story in question is that of Griet, the daughter of a family fallen on hard times, who enters the service of the painter Vermeer as a maid, in order to supplement her parent's meagre income. Almost at once she disturbs the equilibrium of the household simply by being there and, in turn, is herself disturbed by the essence of its master who, though not very often physically present at first, dominates the lives of his large and ever-growing family. When she joins Vermeer's household Griet is on the cusp of womanhood and the growing yet unacknowledged bond between them is, nevertheless, sensed by Catharina, his wife, who treats Griet harshly. Unexpectedly Griet finds an ally in Catharina's mother who in subtle yet effective ways makes Griet's life more comfortable than it might otherwise have been. <br /> <br />Chevalier's book enables us to see the almost non-person status of women at that time, particularly those who were also servants. Indeed, in the person of Catharina we have a figure who is almost literally, little more than a baby-making machine. Yet, in the person of Griet, she also gives us an admirable heroin with an integrity that is unmatched by the men who seek to control her. <br />
0140067477|5.0|I was holed up in a hospital bed when I recieved this book. A friend thought that I was wallowing in self pity and wanted me to get a grip so this is what she brought me. The Tao of Pooh incorporates the teachings of Taoism and the great Lao Tzu who believed that people should be able to look at things and appreciated the beauty of its being and note the positives. Pooh bear and his friends make light of the Tao teachings by explaining simplicity, happiness, relaxation, and just not worrying or being overly concerned about trivial matters. Pooh is the perfect creature to explain this because he is just a simple bear who is laid back and gentle. Pooh does not worry about matters but just lets life flow and is grateful for his honey and his friends. Taoism reflects on the way to an understanding of concious simplicity and peace. Its a way to joy and mindfulness which is the ultimate keys to living well. This book is such a nice read since it includes picture of the characters to highlight points, and its narrator explains things simply since after all its the child like pooh who is the student. It really eased my mind and I have since tried to use some of these teachings in my life.
B000BGH22W|4.0|I have read all the reviews of the soundtracks, and I would like to say that many of the reviewers here who hated the soundtrack didn't see the movie and haven't read the books.  Just how do you expect to know what the music is about unless you put it with the movie?  Yes, listening to the music first can help you prepare, but ultimately, you won't have a clue until you read the books/watch the movies. <br /> <br />For those of you who didn't like the soundtrack and actually had good reasons, I have nothing against you.  After all, we all have our opinions.  It is only certain people that aren't using common sense. <br /> <br />About the rock music on the soundtrack, of course if you haven't seen the movie or read the books you would be appalled.  \\"It isn't Harry Potter\\" you say?  In the Harry Potter books/movie, there is a popular rock group called the Wierd Sisters, and they DO play at the Yule Ball.  The music absolutely belonged on the soundtrack.  But you wouldn't know that without seeing the movie and reading the book would you? <br /> <br />Yes, it's not John Williams.  But I see it this way, this movie is unlike the other movies, it is darker, less like the children's books earlier in the series.  Having a new composer helps to reflect that.  Sure I'd love to see John Willimas back, but now not at the expense of Patrick Doyle.  This soundtrack has earned it's place in my CD rack.
B000803PKY|5.0|Running on Empty rocked the music world almost 30 years ago, both literally and figuratively: a live album of all new material, recorded on stage, backstage, on a bus and in hotel rooms!  Now, with enhanced 5.1 sound (it sounds great!), two previously unreleased songs, and hundreds of moving, candid photographs by Joel Bernstein, this classic record has been masterfully revitalized.  R&R Hall of Famer, Jackson Browne, never sounded better, surrounded by some of rock's best musicians from that classic era.  To me, Russ Kunkel's drums always sounded \\"bigger\\" than anyone else's at the time, and David Lindley's virtuosity on anything with strings was never more evident.  This release is a gift to Jackson Browne's abiding fans, and to those who will be!
B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie, is probably one of the only movies I can watch Tom Cruise in. I believe he captured the character of Lestat, and Brad Pitt was brilliant as Louis, and Kirsten Dunst was quite the little Claudia, and of course Antonio Banderas was great as Armand. This movie captured most of Anne Rice's novel-which by the way I enjoy more than the movie.  <br />This movie truly is the definitive movie on vampires. It should be the movie that all movies about vampires should be measured against. I don't think they could have done a better job with this movie, except there were many things left out of the novel, but I believe it captured most of the important events. Truly a wonderful and remarkable film, and the cast was outstanding!
B00080ZG10|1.0|Scorsese used to be a contender. Now he's a sad parody of himself, pitching a tired, bloated, by the numbers tale that runs out of gas not long after the premiere of Wings, which is where this tale should have ended. Everything after Hughes' short lived triumph is a predictable slide into madness. DiCaprio hams it up like the histrionic bore he's always threatened to be, while La Blanchett proves once again how over-rated she is. Her tiny little feet don't come close to filling Katherine Hepburn's shoes. This movie projects an illusion of class. It's insincere, pretentious waffle. Jonathan Demme's overlooked gem, Melvin & Howard, managed to say a whole lot more about Howard Hughes in five minutes than this overstuffed turkey manages in numerous hours. At least, it felt like hours.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna's Immaculate Collection has great hits from Madonna like \\"Vogue\\" to \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" to the sexy song \\"Justify My Love\\"!!!!!!!!! I think that anyone that loves Madonna should buy this greatest hits collection you will love it forever and ever!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE EMBARRASMENT TO MADONNA AND TO MADONNA FANS WORLDWIDE. What is Madonna thinking? Is she crazy? She's copying over 75% of the music ideas from \\"Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie\\" by ABBA in the new hit song \\"Hung Up.\\" This is not new music. This is copied and unoriginal. She must made that song in only one hour. ABBA should sue Madonna for this. I CAN'T BELIEVE MADONNA IS THE MOST HIGHLY-RATED ARTIST OF ALL TIME ENDS UP TO BE THE MOST PLAGIARIST ARTIST OF ALL TIME. WHY IS HER RECORD COMPANY ALLOWING PLAGIARIZE MUSIC TO THE PUBLIC? WHAT A DISGRACE.
B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson's Thriller is just awesome each track is great listening to whenever possible!!!!! Michael has had i believe four number one singles on this cd and of course when the cd came out it was number one on the Billboard Top 100 for i believe 9 weeks that is great for Michael!!!!!! This cd is so classic you have songs like \\" Thriller\\" to \\"Billie Jean\\" to \\"Beat It\\"!!!!! If you love collecting your music then go out and get yourself a copy of this classic Michael Jackson album!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Leave it to the Europeans Honey! <br />Jump 9/10  <br />Very catchy, dancy song. One of the shorter tracks that could've been longer.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette came out with this incredible cd and each track pumps you up everytime!!!!!! I would have to say that this is Alanis's best cd out and i think that she is a talented singer/songwriter!!!!!!! Her lyrics range from a mean lady to a calm lady that is pretty much what you can expect from this cd,but trust me its worth owning!!!!!!
B00006LLOG|5.0|Listen with headphones. Anyone should be able to respect and enjoy this cd.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|I like pop standards,but made the mistake of buying this horrible <br />covers album instead of a compilation album of some of the originals. <br /> <br />I'm sure Rod Stewart will release a 5th 'Great American Songbook' and a 6th and a 7th and an 8th.But I learned my lesson.And sold this to a used record store for a buck.
0790731479|1.0|A haunting movie in which everything is played for laughs. <br />There are no serious moments, deep introspections, revelations, life reviews, insights into life's purpose, etc. It is a non-stop gimmicks, special effects, sight gags, visual fluff suitable for the younger set. <br />The hero and heroine drown together in a car accident, discover they are dead and back in their dearly beloved house. They can't leave because there are monsters outside. Their peace in interrupted by the new owners who decide to redo the place in a ridiculous gaudy style. They notice an unexpected book \\"The Handbook for the recently deceased.\\" on the nightstand which serves as their guide to their new situation. Through it they discover how to reach their \\"caseworker\\" and an obnoxious haunter named Beetlejuice <br />who might be able to help them remove the new occupants. Everything they try fails to work and in the end they accept the new owners. The owner's daughter becomes closer to them than her step-parents providing the child they always wanted and couldn't have. Other than the idea that they can not see themselves in a mirror and that the new owners cannot see them (except the daugthter), there is little we learn about the afterlife here. We see a couple brief scenes of the caseworker's office which can only be described as depressing. Worst movie I have seen in a long time.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Madonna has never been 100 % original. She has always borrowed ideas from other artists but she usually masked those ideas with her own originality. Unfortunately, on this album, she does not even hide her blatant borrowing and it seems she is running out of steam. She borrows ideas from ABBA, The Jacksons, Kylie, The Police, GoldFrapp, and Donna Summer. She even borrows ideas from her former glorious self. Part of Madonna's problem is she is relying too heavily on Euro Pop. Since Ray of Light, Madonna has used Euro Pop to mask other things she has been lacking. What's lacking are passion and energy in her voice and meaningful and creative lyrics. Clearly, Madonna at 47 is at a crossroad...she needs to make a decision on continuing to be Queen of Pop or just another Euro Pop female singer. Having said that, this cd is not bad but it is not to the level that we expect from Queen Madonna.
B000BGH22W|5.0|Patrick Doyle's score, along with the movie, has brought the \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise up to new heights, breathing a fresh life into the series.  Though John Williams is a genius at composing, and his artistry will go down in history as some of the best, \\"Harry Potter\\" was not his finest work.  He had several themes that came through strong, but for the most part, the music on the albums tended to bleed together, all sounding remarkably similar.  Not the case with \\"Goblet of Fire.\\" <br /> <br />As a new comer to the series, Patrick Doyle's score makes an impact.  He has refashioned the \\"Harry Potter\\" theme, while making his mark with a new version.  Tracks that stand above the rest include \\"The Stroy Continues,\\" \\"Cedric,\\" and \\"Voldemort,\\" all of which introduce and continue Goblet's themes and storylines.  \\"Cedric\\" is of particular note, with Doyle paying close attention to the first major death of the series, one that shocked all readers.  It is a sweetly sad song, one that without even watching the movie you would know was meant to be heartbreaking.  Without such poignant themes, the film would have been lost in the realm of bad scores.   <br /> <br />Thumbs up to Doyle (and Williams, for his establishing groundwork.)  Let's hope the good work continues.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|So here we have it: one of the worst films of all time. This is ridiculously bad. Maybe it's supposed to be bad, like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes? Come on, Bob Dylan's about 1,000,000 times funnier than whoever wrote the script for this album, and Dylan doesn't even write comedy for a living!<br /><br />Anyway, this is really really bad. There is no plot. And the jokes... \\"Bow to your sensei!\\" \\"Give me some of your tots!\\" \\"Vote for Pedro!\\" \\"Flippin' Sweet!\\" \\"Gosh!\\"...these are supposed to be funny? No. Definetly no. There is a reason why this got such bad review from the press, people! It's bad!<br /><br />And now kids are walking around with Napolean Dynamite t-shirts and quoting it at every possible opprotunity. What has the film industry become? Argh!<br /><br />If you want REAL funny stuff, go with the Simpsons, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, or classic Dylan albums. If you want mindless drivel, this is your outlet! Just don't say I didn't warn you!
B000002UCQ|5.0|As it is unlikely that you don't know that this is George Harrison's finest work, that he had a magnificence all his own notwithstanding the fact that his guitar work (along with Ringo's drumming) anchored the Beatles, I won't say all that.  Instead, I'll say, listen to \\"Apple Scruffs\\" instead of reading these reviews.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|She basically hit a high note with Ray of Light and has been copying the Euro trance-dance mood from that album since, with little tweaks here and there. Remember when Madonna would completely change it up with every album? Now we get a string of rehashes. Imagine Ray of Light, but with the lyrics written by her daughter. And most of the songs sound like they USED to be a song, but the DJ she hired to produce it watered it down into a club song.  <br /> <br /> <br />Forbidden Love 4/10  <br />The weakest and only filler track on the album. Why she put this on here is beyond me. But the other tracks more than make up for this song. It just is no good, you can't dance to it. Check out Forbidden Love on her Bedtime Stories album though. That song is amazing. <br /> <br />
B00000J7JO|5.0|There are not enough words in the english language to describe the greatness of this album.  This was the cd that introduced me to the seminal greatness of RHCP.  There is not a bad track.  This cd has, in my opinion, some of the best songs in existence.  Otherside, Easily, Road Trippin', and Scar Tissue are some of the best songs I have ever heard.  The only song that doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the cd is Purple Stain.  It doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the cd.
B00005JO1P|4.0|Movie biopics are generally problematic: how do you get all or a major portion of a person's life on the screen in more or less than 2 hours? How do you do justice to anyone's life in 120 minutes?<br />There have been good examples of course, but most of them have been good because the writer or director has wisely chosen to telescope/hone in on a relatively short portion of a subject's life: Billie Holiday's in \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" or Truman Capote's in \\"Capote.\\" Both films, I realize with wildly different results, but both equally effective because the focus of each has been telescoped and better stated...microscoped onto a short portion of each life: both Truman Capote and Billie Holiday have been revealed and analyzed and effectively appreciated through the learned and discretionary eye of someone who effectively separates the legend from the reality.<br />Director James Mangold (the quirky \\"Heavy\\" and the effective \\"The Yards\\") would not seem a logical choice to direct a probing film about Johnny Cash (an audaciously effective Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter ( a wonderful Reese Witherspoon) but he does manage most of the time to steer away from the maudlin and melodramatic and in the process comes up with a good, straight-forward biopic of the two.<br />The obvious comparison to \\"Walk The Line\\" would be the recent \\"Ray\\" but whereas Jamie Foxx's recreation of Ray Charles borders on caricature and mimicry, Phoenix's Cash always seems and feels organic: he doesn't so much as inhabit Cash's spirit and persona as interpret it. Phoenix not only uses his own voice to sing the songs...he uses his own psychic voice to creep inside of Cash to reveal the Cash inside of Phoenix and the Phoenix inside of Cash and this translates into a thrilling, revealing portrait of the two.<br />Witherspoon also does her own singing and because we know a lot less of Carter's life, manufactures and makes real a character that is both simple and straightforward as well as one who, though she loves and admires her talented and famous family, longs for her own place in the world in general and in the entertainment world specifically: she is less wounded than Cash but equally on the lookout for personal and professional validation.<br />\\"Walk The Line\\" is not the best movie ever made but it certainly is not the worst. The best biopics require strong, incandescent performances at their core and \\"WTL\\"has that in spades with Phoenix and Witherspoon's revolutionary recreations/interpretations of Cash and Carter.<br />Enter the world of \\"Walk The Line\\" with an open mind and heart and you will be rewarded with both a noble and novel interpretation of two lives and two people who dared to be talented and blessed in a world that often attempted to stamp out and diffuse those that were different in favor of mediocrity.admires her talented and famous family, longs for her own place in the world in general and in the entertainment world specifically: she is less wounded than Cash but equally on the lookout for personal and professional validation.  \\"Walk The Line\\" is not the best movie ever made but it certainly is not the worst.

B000B8QEZG|1.0|Guys, dont buy this horrible c.d ..The industry is allready saying an American Idol is going to beat Madonna's first weeksales. That is SAD..Sorry is also another good song. The rest are tired, dated, heard it b4 non-sense!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I don't know how she does it but she released an even better cd. Madonna is eternal and this cd is proof.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|My critique of the movie: <br /> <br />Johnny Depp's acting was horrible, as ever. The Oompa Loompa's look was redundant and uncreative. True, it was nice to see teh songs put to music, but this film, IMHO, sucked A LOT. My cousins and I were making fun of this movie after we saw it, and we were trashing it, that's how bad we thought it was. <br /> <br />The original owns, at least Gene Wilder didn't make Willy Wonka seem like he was out of touch with the world. GOD! The original was better on EVERY level, it was funnier too. <br /> <br />But this is just my opinion.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|The new song Dont Forget about Us is Great..Mariah is really on a Hot-Streak this Year. I see some Grammies coming her way
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I doesn't know if it's a comedy or a horror film. Too bad it's neither funny nor scary. I'm a big fan of fantasy and the cast is first-rate but the whole thing falls flat with a giant thud - you'll want the two hours of your life back.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|These Confessions shouldve been kept to herself. Push is horrendous. Hung Up is an example of plagarism at its worse. Isaac is all over the place. The only good thing about this c.d is sorry. btw. Madonna just LOST a plagiarism suit, a very serious one , the courts in Belgium say she STOLE the song Frozen.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Frances The Mute continues the singular vision of this extraordinary group who are one of the few rock bands continually pushing the boundaries of music today. they keep things interesting and frighteningly alive in their compositions, but they do it all with class, confidence, and style. this album doesn't seem to have all the immediate hooks that De-loused In The Comatorium had, but it has grown on me quite a bit. the absence of their sound manipulator, Jeremy Ward is painfully obvious on this album. when the spacey noise/ambient sections appear within these songs, they sound below average and frankly boring. for example, using samples of children playing or slowing down the pitch of the voice is just not original and not interesting to me. i miss the more textured and layered approach from the De-loused album. but all in all, it's a minor qualm. these songs reach deeper into a strange dark world of murky electronics and heavy angular riffage that propels these songs into alien territory. hard to imagine, but The Mars Volta got even more wild and weirder than before. it's great to see them stretching themselves and challenging themselves and the listener. i can't wait to see what's next...
B000002W9Q|5.0|Where in the world can you get such a great combination of old and new and enjoy it so much?  That's what this soundtrack offers: a little bit of something for everyone.  Again, the movie without the soundtrack would have just been a movie - but it's the music that made it a hit.  Another \\"must own\\" soundtrack!
B00005J6T0|5.0|<br />Apart from 'The Immaculate Collection', which is more of a greatest hits album that contains a huge number of Madonna's golden hits, this is probably my favourite album. It contains 3 of my favourite Madonna songs 'Papa Don't Preach', 'Open Your Heart' and 'La Isla Bonita' as well as the slightly overrated but also very good 'Live to Tell'. The track list goes as follows: <br /> <br />1. Papa Don't Preach - Could possibly be my favourite Madonna song ever, certainly one of them. Lovely sounding, and the lyrics are incredibly well written, facing the issues of abortion and teen pregnancy, difficult subjects to write about. The video is also one of Madonna's best in my opinion, and possibly my favouite.  10/10 <br /> <br />2. Open Your Heart - Another favouite of mine, not quite as much as before, but still a great song. It's hard-hitting and great to dance to. Madonna classic. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. White Heat - Not as great as the others, but that doesn't at all mean it's a bad song.  And you gotta agree, it has a great title! 7/10 <br /> <br />4. Live to Tell - Another hit for Madonna. As I said before, I feel this is slightly overrated, but the lyrics are well written, and still a beautiful song. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Where's the Party - A very joyful, bouncy song. Madonna's asking 'where's the fun? I gotta get in on it!' Not my favourite, but still fine to listen to. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />6. True Blue - The title track, which many people have said is a 50's/60's homage, and I honestly couldn't see where they were coming from, but I guess it kinda is.  Oh well, I love nostalgia! Quite a pleasant and fun song. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. La Isla Bonita - Certainly one of my favourie Madonna songs of all time.  It's sways and throbs like an exotic heat, and is about a yearning to be 'where the sun warms the sky/when it's time for siesta you can watch them go by/beautiful faces, no cares in this world/where a girls loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl.' Great song by Madonna. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Jimmy Jimmy - A lot of people didn't like this one.  I agree is isn't fantastic, but it's still a fine song. I wouldn't pick it, but I certainly don't dismiss it as being bad. 7/10 <br /> <br />9. Love Makes The World Go Round - At first I thought this was a ballad, but it's a bit too fast and bouncy. It's quite a nice song, not amazing, but still nice, with a positive message. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />The final tracks 10 & 11 are two good remixes of True Blue and La Isla Bonita.  Overall I find this album immensly satisfiying, and could certainly recommend it to anyone.  The 'True Blue' phase was also my favourite Madonna look, with her newly short hair and a great new style.  It's my favourite Madonna phase, and in my opinion her strongest too.  I don't think Madonna's career would be as respected as it is if it weren't for True Blue.  You also have to admit she has never looked as extraordinarily beautiful as she did during late 80's/early 90's.  It was an excellent time for her. Overall: 8.5/10. Highly recommened.  <br />
B000001FDK|5.0|I am so thankful I grew up in the era when this movie came out.  It was not only a pleasure to watch, but it was fantastic to listen to.  John and Olivia are amazing - together - both with their onscreen chemistry and their singing.  Every song is a #1 hit and it's definately a soundtrack to add to your collection.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|The best songs on the album in this order are Hung Up, Forbidden Love, How High, and Isaac. This is not an album I'll keep as I just won't listen to it enough.  <br /> <br />I watched the MTV Europe awards and basically cried after her performance because it was SO GREAT. I couldn't wait for the album and now I'm just terribly disappointed.  <br /> <br />She's lost the plot and I can't even begin to think what her next move will be. It looks like Carrie Underwood may just knock her off the #1 spot too and that is SO SAD.  <br />
B000B8QF14|4.0|Having never gone to one of their concerts (I'm embarrassingly old but a hardcore punk fan from the early days) I really enjoyed this DVD/CD. I'd heard they put on a great stage show, and this one was really fun. I liked the interviews (not enough of those, as far as I'm concerned), and the too-short audience interviews were extremely funny. If you're a Green Day fan, buy it--you can't go wrong. One question never answered: does Billie Joe ever take the makeup off??
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ce nouveau CD se classe sans difficult parmi les meilleurs albums de Madaonna. <br />Les chansons se suivent sans se ressembler. Une fois encore, Madaonne innove, se rinvente, bref de la pure musique ! <br />
B00006JDVV|3.0|In the not too distant future, a subterranean engineering project in London unleashes a nightmare. A fire breathing dragon is waked and devastation ensues. As civilization falls, scientists figure out that the dragons have periodically awoken and consumed everything. They retire into hibernation only when their food stocks are exhausted. That means everything is eaten. <br /> <br />Around the world, civilizations fall. There are few survivors and those are more hard pressed with each and every year. As the food stocks dwindle, the dragons get more viscious. The prospect for humanities survival looks bleak. <br /> <br />There are a few survivors holding out in Scotland but even they are not expecting to survive too much longer. Then they get some surprise visitors. Some guys (and a gal) from America have figured out how to kill them. They have cobbled together some military gear and make it across the Atlantic. They are in bad shape but they know their goal. There is one master creature which is the key. That is the original. That one is in London. When that one is dead, they will all die. Its not going to be easy. <br /> <br />This is an action movie. The story is fair and the action is pretty good. It is the dragons which carry the film, though. They are done with CGI and are realistic and frightening. They make the show believable. <br /> <br />This is not a memorable film but it is enjoyable while it lasts. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's become a new cliche amongst the media. \\"Madonna has returned to her roots.\\" Well, if anyone actually heard the album they would soon realize that claim is false. The sound on the album is a step forward in modern dance music. It sounds nothing similar of the early disco/r&b sound inhabiting Madonna's 1983 debut album. <br />Maybe what people mean is that Madonna has taken a break with the complex situations and observations in her lyrical work and focused more on the genius of what she does best, lyrical hooks. <br />When people claim to prefer Madonna's earlier efforts it's no suprise why, the lyrics were much more catchy and Madonna was less focused on being an artiste as opposed to a pop genius. <br />Well, that side of Madonna certainly is seen on this disc, right from the disco thumper smash hit \\"Hung Up\\" right through to \\"Like it or Not.\\" <br />The beauty of this disc is that everyone seems to have a different opinion as to what is the best tracks. It's all up to the listener on their journey through this darker dance offering from pop's greatest verteran. <br /> <br />As one can see throughout the reviews, we see that Mariah's, Kylie's, Britney's, and even Goldfrapp's fans have come to deliberately bash the record to pump up their own stars. Queens fighting over queens, how thoughtful and a lot of time on their hands obviously. It shows that no one has faith in their own icon, and have to try and degrade another's. How can the world end war if people are sparring off pop stars. I wish Amazon would take responsibility for the obvious redundant and useless reviews. <br /> <br />Just sit back and enjoy the music. <br />
B000001F5F|5.0|Even though I give U2's \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" five stars, this amazing EP STILL screams for a deluxe version. When this was originally released, it came out as a budget EP at a special price, and it even clocked in at many a band's album length. Eight songs at forty minutes, covering the band's first three albums.<br /><br />There were stories at the time that so many music-producer buffs wanted to work with the band that Jimmy Iovine slashed his superstar fee for the opportunity to work with U2. It was really to the band's benefit, as he completely stripped away Steve Lillywhite's echo-heavy and reverb-drenched production, and gave U2 a crystal clean mix. It caught the band in great form, cocky and confident, and on the brink of the second stage of their career. That clarity also gave many people their first real glimpse at just how amazing The Edge's guitar playing is and how much he brings to the band.<br /><br />Even more interesting is that the band was eager to push themselves and their audience even at this early stage of the game. Band favorites like \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\" are mixed in with \\"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\\" and \\"Trash Trampoline and Party Girl.\\" And despite Bono's protestations, \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" will always be a rebel song in my heart.<br /><br />Why I still think this album could be upgraded is that I am sure somewhere the entire Red Rocks concert is on tape. Like expanded editions of The Who's \\"Live At Leeds,\\" Peter Frampton's \\"Frampton Comes Alive,\\" Elton John's \\"Here and There\\" and David Bowie's \\"Stage,\\" \\"Live At Red Rocks\\" (and the U2 catalog overall!) deserves an upgrade. While the deluxe CD/DVD now includes the Red Rocks DVD and the CD tracks are now listed with the locations credited, what is stopping Island and U2 fron a full concert CD release?
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Another great album from the Queen!  I don't understand why some fans don't like this product!  It's absolutely FANTASTIC!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album is one of my favorites of all time. I have always been a big fan of RHCP and this cd was one of the 90's best rock album. If you like RHCP style, chances are you will like this album. Every song was great. When you listen to it full through, It's amazing how you are constantly kept entertained. I never find myself wanting to skip a track. Although if I really had to pick a track that isn't as good as the others the only one I can say I didnt care for much was \\"Porcelain\\". Its softness isn't something I would want to hear alone without being in concession with the rest of the cd. It's just a bit boring. Although it does add a relax point to the album and I dont mind it being there. This cd out of 10 would get a 9.7. Just near perfect. It's great and you should pick up your copy now.
B000063DIH|4.0|For some reason, this album has a lot of negative stigma attached to it, and I have no idea why. No, it doesn't sound like Maiden's awesome 80's efforts (\\"Piece Of Mind\\", \\"Powerslave\\", etc). It's a pretty big change in style, but it's still pretty damn good (and even better where you compare it to Maiden's last release, the average \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\".    First off, let me say what's bad about this album: Bruce, man, what happened to your voice? It's not anywhere as odd as it was on \\"No Prayer\\", but really, it doesn't sound as if Bruce was trying as hard here as he was on previous albums. Also, there are a few filler tracks here, such as \\"Fear Is The Key\\" and \\"Weekend Warrior\\", that kind of take away from the album. \\"But,\\" you say, \\"you can skip over the tracks you don't like!\\" To which I reply, that's true... but this is IRON MAIDEN we're talking about here! If it had been any other band, this would probably be a 5-star effort. But I hold Maiden up to a far higher standard than most other bands, and having filler on a Maiden album is simply unacceptable. Period.    Then why did I give this album four stars? Because there's much to enjoy here as well. \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\" is one of my favorite Maiden opening tracks, \\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\\" is a beautiful ballad that I definitely enjoy, and \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"The Fugitive\\", \\"The Apparition\\", and \\"Judas Be My Guide\\" are all catchy, enjoyable tracks. And, of course, there's the awesome title track, which is, to this day, one of my favorite Maiden songs, hands down. Most of the people who trash the album even like this song.    So, yes, there's lots for Maiden fans to enjoy here, but it's not of the band's greatest albums. If you're new to the band, i'd recommend that you start elsewhere (probably with their mid-80's albums), but once you've picked up a few Maiden records, then come back here and buy this one as well. If you're already into Maiden but are hesitant to buy this album, I say download a few of the better tracks (and make sure you get the title track), and see if you like what you hear.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Nicolas Cage (Face/Off, Family Man, upcoming Weather Man) stars as Yuri Orlov, who is an arms dealer who sells guns to people in other countries....where their for he gets money. Along the while he has a brother named Vitaly, played nicely by Jared Leto (Alexander, Requiem For A Dream, Urban Legend) but here's the thing, Vitaly has a cocaine problem and tends to bring hooker like women around all the time. Leto helps his brother Cage in the business. Cage falls for once glamour modle Ava Fontaine, played by Bridget Moynahan (Sum Of All Fears, The Recruit), the fall in the love and have a kid named Nicky. Cage buys her nice things, clothes, jewerly in the process. Ethan Hawke (Assault On Precinct 13, Tape, Taking Lives) plays Agent Jack Valentine who will do anything to bring down Cage and him manufactoring guns...in which case it wont happen because there's a lot more people around the world who manufactor guns as well. Cage brings life to his performance in Yuri...terrific as always Cage is....and I dont think any other actor would be right for the role. In the same vein as Three Kings. One of the best movies of the year...right up there with Crash and Sin City...well, that's just me for ya anyway. Also starring Ian Holm (Lord OF The Rings Trilogy, Aviator).
B000268QB2|5.0|This band is truly talented , great songs , heartfelt, and spectacular vocals .
B00005JO1P|5.0|Joaquin (Leaf) Phoenix (Ladder 49, Clay Pigeons) blazes and exlpodes emotionally and terrifically as the man in black, Johnny Cash, just as Jamie Foxx did last year when he played legendary Ray Charles. Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly  performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself. A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances. \\"Hello....I'm Johnny Cash!!!!\\"
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is a great book to demonstrate certain literary devices. This book is a great book to understand foreshadowing and symbolism. Heller uses great symbolism to present the idea or purpose he's trying to get across. The one main problem I had with this novel was the confusion that Heller puts the reader through. I like books that have mystery but are straight forward with explaining the ideas, exceppt for Heller who makes you think you know the idea but there's actually a twist to it.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Honestly, I don't even care much for c/w music, but this soundtrack may change my mind.  Harris, Nelson, McBride, and Earle make excellent contributions. I could have done without the Ronstadt song, if only because it doesn't seem to fit with the others.  Otherwise, I adored the Thompson/Wainwright take on \\"King of the Road,\\" and Gustavo Santaolalla's restrained guitar is so heartbreaking that I want to check out the rest of his music.  Highly recommended.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I will do a song by song review.  Those are the type I like the best! ;o) <br /> <br />1.  \\"Hung Up\\" 5/5 ---  This song is amazing.  The first single off the album; very catchy! <br />2.  \\"Get Together\\"  5/5 ---  This song should be one of the singles.  It's just amazing!   <br />3.  \\"Sorry\\" 5/5 ---  The rumoured second single, awesome beat.  The beginning has Madonna saying \\"forgive me\\" in many different languages.  It gives the song a very cool and different start. <br />4.  \\"Future Lovers\\" 3/5 ---  While I only gave this 3 out of 5 stars, it's still a very good song.  Never dull, and Madonna's voice overs are awesome in it.  It just doesn't quite touch me as a song itself.  As a song between \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"I love New York\\"  it's a perfect and different break. <br />5.  \\"I Love New York\\" 4/5 ---  The lyrics might be a little cheesy, but they're not enough so to break the song.  The awesome beat makes this song! <br />6.  \\"Let It Will Be\\" 5/5 ---  This song is said to be very William Orbit-esque, and I agree.  It's a perfect and catchy song.  I was a little leary of it with it's title being a little off, but it's amazing.  The chorus sucks you in! <br />7.  \\"Forbidden Love\\" 5/5 ---  \\"----------\\"  Leaves me speechless! <br />8.  \\"Jump\\"  5/5  Another amazing and catchy tune from this album.  Madonna really does amazing job! <br />9.  \\"How High\\"  5/5 ---  This song takes the alum into a little deeper of a mode asking \\"how much fortune can you make?\\"  Awesome beginning to the song; great tune! <br />10.  \\"Isaac\\" 3/5 ---  This song is very strange and a little different from the rest of the album.  I believe this is one of the songs they were talking about when they said some of the material was from a musical Madonna was writing.  It's strange, but naturally with this album and the turn Madonna took, it's amazing :o) <br />11.  \\"Push\\" 3/5 ---  This song is the only one I actually skip over.  The beat is frigging awesome; it really is.  But..sadly, whenever Madonna starts singing I cringe and just skip the song.  It's sad to admit, but I will for the reviews sake.  The beat is amazing though, I just with I liked the way she sang it better.  This is, in my opinion, the only slighty-bad track on the album, and it's STILL got the awesome beat to carry itself. <br />12.  \\"Like It Or Not\\" 5/5 ---  Once again Madonna manages to create an absolutely *amazing* closing song.  The beat, the lyrics, the sounds, everything.  Great lyrics...even better than 2000s \\"Gone\\" from the Music album. <br /> <br />I'm giving this album 5 stars because despite some of my 3 star or 4 star ratings, the album is still absolutely amazing, knock me off my feet fantastic.  Buy this album!!!

Bay Area's Blue Cheer's 1968 debut remains to this day, an unparallelled aural scorcher of the highest strain. In the entire canon of acid/heavy/psyche/prog/doom/stoner rock - and that's encompassing quite a few bands and even more recordings! - few underground records have been as influential as the blistering \\"Vincebus Eruptum,\\" it's latin title translates as \\"control of chaos,\\" a most apt title.<br /><br />As a youngster in the 80s who loved getting lost in music and who was learning to play the drums, I immediately siezed upon this in a used record shop after seeing the old black and white Beat Club footage of them playing their fuzzed out, over-amped, feedback-addled, floor tom-tom driven cover of Eddie Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues\\" {which, incidentally, smokes The Who's version, *literally*} So much music came out of that era, and none as notorious as Blue Cheer, who, as someone once exclaimed, they played so loud \\"they turned the air into cottage cheese.\\" They followed \\"Vincibus\\" up with the slightly subdued yet gloriously psychedelic \\"Outsideinside,\\" a real corker of an album. But after that, and aside from a few choice cuts on their third album {\\"Peace of Mind\\" and \\"Fruit and Icebergs\\"}, they dwindled, sounding like any other middle-of-the-road rock band of the early 70s.<br /><br />A few years back, AKARMA re-issued this on 180 gram vinyl, complete with embossed jacket. Seek it out and discover the sounds of truly electrifying heavy acid music before heavy metal made any compromises or got hair cuts. Personally, I've vowed to never cut mine.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|I didn't like John much. He was an arrogant self absorbed self centered egotistical self proclaimed god. But I miss him! <br />Millions of us miss him and are still hurting after all these years after his death and one reason was because we knew rock wouldn't survive long without him and it did not! <br />Going into the week of the 25th anniversary of the death of John Lennon I as many can only imagine what the world would be like he had lived and he were still with us today. \\"Working class hero\\" is John in all his splendor. It truly has all the hits that remind us why we love him so much and why we still still hurt so bad even yet today over his loss December 8th, 1980 and why we may never get over it.  <br />Rest in peace my friend and we will always remember!
B000B8QF00|1.0|Right, I'll make this short : compilations should be illegal, it's really not nice trying to make us pay for a whole cd when there's only one or two tunes that aren't already on the original albums. And don't go telling me I can just download the mp3 from the internet, you'll really piss me off, or I'll have to start telling you about decent packaging and authentic hifi quality... Just can't be bothered. I have every original cd of Alanis', but this time I'll pass, I can make my own compilation and it won't cost me a dime. God how I hate these money making times we live in !! Alanis, I'm a little disappointed...
B00003CXDV|5.0|I have always been wary of spoofs because they tend to make me feel ashamed of the things I love.  Not Galaxy Quest! As a fan of both Star Trek and the sci-fi genre, I can say that this show makes fun of it but also honors it. It is people who love Star Trek making fun of it and therefore it keeps it fun, funny, and unoffensive to fans. This is one of my favorite movies ever! See it!
0307276902|5.0|What a powerful and emotional rollercoaster of a book!  I still think about it, feel about it and engage about it after 2 weeks of reading it. <br />James Frey comes across as a thud and monster at the beginning, but as you read and the story unfolds, you also start to see the real James Frey and how real he is.   <br />Reading the book, I felt I was right there with him, feeling his pain and his love for Lily.  This book is not only about the addiction but also a love story. <br />You must MUST read \\"My Friend Leonard\\" after you read this book.
B000050X31|3.0|This is a run of the mill Metropolitan Opera production, with few stars and rather boring and unimaginative costumes and sets. The singing does not make up for the lack excitement, especially Tamino was very mediocre. Kathleen Battle sings beautifully but her bizarre facial expressions were very distracting. Luciana Serra was   very good as Queen of the Night, but her costume was very old fashioned and little cheap, like Halloween one. Kurt Moll has a great voice for Sarastro, and Papageno's singing was also good, but he was playing it for the laughs too much. This is not a very exciting version of The Magic Flute.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Not sure exactly what to say about this movie.  It's one of my top 3 favorites of all time.  I never get tired of watching it. <br /> <br />Romance, swashbuckling, humor.  Just a beautiful story. <br /> <br />I can't recommend a movie any more highly.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Well it seems that the motto of Mariah Carey is just like the title of this review. While her latest work \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" has been a huge success throughout the world by going 6 time platinum (4 in US) and has earned her the lead nomminations(and awards) in most of the awards ceremonies, Carey has now realsed a early extented version of her latestest effort(as long as the going's good). The 14 tracks from the original version are all present in the \\"Ultra Platinum\\" edition along with 4 bonus tracks namely: Carey's new hit \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"Makin' It Last All Night\\" (featuring Jermaine Dupri), \\"So Lonely (One & Only II)\\" and \\"We Belong Together Remix) (featuring Jadakiss and Styles P.). The album is released in form of a deluxe limited edition CD/DVD combo as well.<br /><br />The DVD features the full length videos of the up-beat dance song \\"It's Like That\\", the smash hit \\"We Belong Together\\", the funky, groovy \\"Shake It Off\\", the new song \\"Get Your Number\\" [(featuring Jermaine Dupri) the song will makes it's US debut on this DVD] and the online link to the video of her new single \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" (link is on Carey's official website [[...] look in the News section Nov. 15 '05). But what's worth the DVD is the all exclusive, never before seen interview \\"Mariah Carey In Her Own Words.\\"(This is one of the reasons why I bought it)<br /><br />As said before since the CD has the same 14 songs with 4 new songs the best songs are the same with a new addition. The best songs are (in order of appearance on CD): It's Like That (this is a infectious song), We Belong Together (the song is already a smash what more can I say), Shake It Off (the hook is just too catchy), Stay The Night (Mariah has given a amazing performance and Kanye West has done a good job of producing), Mine Again (Mariah display as to why she is call \\"The Voice\\"), Circles and Your Girl (these are bound to become great love songs and the first one is a definite not-to-perform for anyAmerican Idol contestants out there reading), Joy Ride (the song is just plain \\"fabulous\\"), Fly Like A Bird (easily the best song on the album and a great gospel/inspirational song which has the most awesome vocals by Mariah) and lastly the new addition Don't Forget About Us (this song is already a Billboard chart buster and is rising it's way to the top. The performance by Carey is just mind blowing, it's likely it will repeat the success of We Belong Together if not more).<br /><br />With this I only have one more thing to say, \\"BUY THE COMBO!!!!\\" Oh and all you guys who didn't buy the original version, \\"BUY THIS ONE!!!!\\"
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Okay the guy below is a complete moron we don't need your summary on everyone's opinion.  heres what it is if you ever wished dream theater would get heavier then this is the cd for you buy it right now.  If your looking for another same old dream theater cd this cd isn't for you although i do still recommend it because it will defenitly grow on you.  bottom line buy this cd and listen to it more than once it's defenitly worth the money.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'm a mostly straight guy but I gotta admit, Madonna makes me open my heart all the way with many of her albums.   <br /> <br />I listen to this new one all the time on the bus and crave going to a super night club to twirl and bend like a mad creaming dervish.  Eegads, it doesn't stop! <br /> <br />How does she grab ahold of me so human much?
B000002U82|5.0|If for some reason you don't already own this, I highly recommend going out and buying it right now. There is something unbelievably powerful about Pink Floyd. This is more than music: this album is a whole other world, fresh and new and unexplored and above all beautiful. I will not comment on any song in particular, because I feel that this album needs to be taken as a whole. And as a whole it is amazing.

B000AMJDHY|4.0|So basically i heard of this band this time last year. <br />Their name was going around as the band that Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy \\"discovered\\".  <br /> <br />I instantly became a fan, not because Pete Wentz found them, but because they were so young and their sound, well, it was more unique than other bands' sounds.  <br /> <br />I also loved the fact they took their name from Orange County's band Name Taken--whom I absolutely love even though they have broken up.  <br /> <br />Over the year, I listened to their music, and liked them more. September came around and I decided to see them along with Augustana, The Receiving End of Sirens, Cartel, and Acceptance.  <br /> <br />I can honestly say that their live performance was very good. I was the only dancing and singing however. I assumed no one really  knew their music or liked it at that. But when October came, the hype of Panic! At the Disco BOOMED!  <br /> <br />Everyone was like \\"OMGIZZEERz!11!! I &#9829; PANIC! at the disco\\"  <br /> <br />whatever... <br /> <br />OK, back on A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. <br />This cd is maybe one of my top 10 releases this year. It's very catchy and doesn't get boring after a few plays. It's worth buying and you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />They prove to be better than Fall Out Boy, the band they are most compared to, for many reasons.  <br /> <br />1. Yes, Brendon of P!ATD and Patrick from FOB do have a similar style, but you can totally tell Brendon has a better range. <br />2. Their live show is better. Patrick cannot sing for beans when he plays live. Brendon is always on key. <br />3. Their cd doesn't get old. FUtCT get's boring after 5 plays.  <br />4. Their lyrics make more sense.  <br /> <br />It's a must buy. <br /> <br />Warning: By this time this year, they are going to be huge.
B00005JO1P|5.0|Walk the Line is a very good film, lifted even higher by its two great lead performances. Joaquin Phoenix is Johnny Cash without a doubt and Reese Witherspoon makes a charmingly sassy June Carter (not to mention they sing all the songs themselves and sound really good to boot). They should both get Oscar nominations along with the film itself. I liked Ray as well, but Walk the Line is a better film in my opinion. If you want to hear great music and get some insight into one of the most influential musical artist ever, don't walk, run to see this one now.
B00062J00S|5.0|This movie is a movie that I don't just watch around Christmas. Has any human being felt as though their life has been worthless and that their dreams haven't come true?- Yes we all have at one point or another.<br /><br />Seeing George Bailey a man filled with a million dreams and hopes of \\"something more\\" than what his small town will allow. George Bailey ends up sacrificing his own hopes and dreams for those he loves- settling what he wants for the ordinary. And on Christmas Eve due to a mishap he thinks of taking his own life. Thanks to a guardian angel that takes him back to his hometown-what it would be like without him... he realizes that his life was worth something...<br /><br />The movie hits every sentimental feeling you can imagine and it leaves you thinking that no life-even your own is worthless.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart gives a performance that makes you fall in love with him each time you see it- the performance that brought him to Hollywood super stardom.With the classic end scene that brings tears to everyone who watches it- for one simple fact George deserves the love and respect they are showing him for after all the good he has done and sacrificed for them. This a movie no matter how many times you watch it you will always be struck with the same feelings of happiness, joy about life, made me want to better myself, and makes you happier about Christmas/ the ones you love. Making you have NO doubt- that it is a wonderful life.<br /><br />This simple movie will stand the test times for it's unviersal themes and if it is not in your DVD collection shame on you!- Hit the buy now button. But, remember it REALLY is a wonderful life afterall...
B000BI0WOA|5.0|An amazing overview of Dire Straits. I am pleased to see epic tracks like Tunnel of Love, Private Investigations and On Every Street on this compilation. (By the way, these songs are even better live.) You can't go wrong picking up this CD.<br /><br />I wouldn't have minded a rarity or two, like the Making Movies song that was never released but available on a bootleg.<br /><br />Although it's hard to argue that any of the Dire Straits songs here are not worthy of inclusion, I am nevertheless suprised by the omissions. (1) Skateaway, the only radio hit from Making Movies, (2) Industrial Disease, the only radio hit from Love Over Gold, (3-4) The Man's Too Strong and One World, both radio hits from Brothers in Arms (though the album is WELL represented here), (5) Heavy Fuel, the only and small radio hit from On Every Street, and (6) Twisting by the Pool, the nervy track from the EP that I used to hear back when it came out.<br /><br />Thanks.
B00000K3CK|5.0|I have never really been a huge fan of black and white movies- but Miracle on 34th Street is one of those few excepetions. Remarkably written and casted this a true Christmas classic that will stay long in your heart after you watch it.<br /><br />The children will enjoy seeing the story and parents will enjoy a well-written story. The actors in the movie give out of this world performances that made them go on to be greats in hollywood history.<br /><br />Staying true to the classic story the movie does not stray from the well-written book. It is one of those movies that make you get into the holiday spirit. It makes you feel a little bit cheerier. It makes adults into believers and kids into true believers. This is definately a movie to own... and be enjoyed around the holidays!
1590710487|5.0|I grew up on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and my favorite comedy is NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE.  I remember the day John Belushi died and I've read WIRED at least three times.  I've also read and reread SATURDAY NIGHT: A BACKSTAGE HISTORY OF \\"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\\" by Doug Hill & Jeff Weingrad and LIVE FROM NEW YORK: AN UNCENSORED HISTORY OF \\"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\\" by Tom Shales & James Andrew Miller.  I also read SAMURAI WIDOW by Judy Jacklin Belushi.<br /><br />So how could there be anything left to say?<br /><br />I hesitated about buying BELUSHI but, after I picked it up and started thumbing through it, I couldn't put it down.  And I couldn't put it down after I got it home.  The stories are told by the people who were at ground zero in Belushi's life and the photos are new and personal.<br /><br />This is a great book for the person discovering what a stormy genius John Belushi was and for the long-time fan who thought he or she knew everything about him.<br /><br />And BELUSHI is also for everyone else in between.<br /><br />As Senator John Blutarsky once said, \\"NOTHING IS OVER UNTIL WE DECIDE IT IS!\\"
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Of all the Aiplane records ever made, this contains some of the best vocal harmonies heard since the Beach Boys and the Mamas And Papas.The one song that I can do without is \\"Comin' Back To Me\\" by Marty Balin.Grace Slick IS the Jefferson Airplane with this release.
B000B8QF00|5.0|This collection features early hits (Hand In My Pocket, You Oughta Know & Ironic), latter day gems (Everything, 8 Easy Steps & Hands Clean), the totally unexpected, but interesting, Hungarian hymm Mercy & my choice for cover version of the year on the Seal song Crazy.  <br />     This isn't a greatest hits CD. It's a collection of most of Alanis's hits as well as some of her personal favorites such as Simple Together, Princes Familiar & That I Would Be Good among others. Alanis has a voice that makes good songs great & great songs amazing. Recommended for fans who don't have CDs such as MTV Unplugged or Feast on Scraps to fill in the holes in their collection from this talented singer/songwriter.
B00028U6B8|5.0|Great jamming, annoying album liner notes and Communism.But like they sing on \\"The Farm\\", \\"It's so gooooood!\\".
0553801503|4.0|I liked Feast <br /> <br />I did by no means \\"love\\" it there are defiantly parts that need work.   <br /> <br />I liked the Jamie chapters.  The great golden crippled fool has finally decided to become his own person now.  While he is at it he and the problem around him provide most of the books humor.  Good for him.   <br /> <br />The Iron Islands chapters-Very cool.  Lots of nifty stuff about power and it just goes to show how Martin can make you care about different characters.   <br /> <br />Done:  Even though we didn't get to see all that much of the place it still seems as if it has a lot of potential.   <br /> <br />That's just the thing with the book it has \\"potential\\" its not perfect  <br /> <br />The Bad  <br /> <br />The vast majority of the humorous moments are gone this is due to the absence of one character in particular that I aware of in advance.  The dwarf is missed in this book.   <br /> <br />Also detail is great but a POV built on detail for the sake of detail is a bad idea.  Samwell and Bernie the Bore should have been cut down to one chapter.  That is not saying that Sam's position does not have the potential to be cool it just isn't cool at the moment.   <br /> <br />Cresi's POV is the one I have the most problem with.  It was interesting to watch her self destruct but we didn't really learn anything from her chapters.  At least when you were reading Sam and Bernie you learned stuff about Westros.   <br /> <br />Overall-Parts of this book are great and parts of this book are a mess.  I am holding out hope for a Dance with Dragons and I think all of you rabid Dany, John and Imp fanboys should give this book another shot.  Please Mr.  Martin don't make us wait until 2010 to see how this all pans out.   <br />
0792844882|4.0|I remember how Elizabeth Berkeley was chastised after this movie.  Many said it was the \\"end of the line\\" for her as it proved she couldn't act.  Well, perhaps it did prove that.  The question is:  so what?  Do people watch movies like SHOWGIRLS in hopes of finding fantastic acting?  If you want to see movies that display great acting, check out Kenneth Branaugh's HAMLET.  If you're looking for a \\"B\\" movie with lots of skin, stick with this one.<br /><br />The main character (played by Berkeley) is not the most likeable character in Hollywood history.  However, she does have just enough attributes to make us care about her.  The movie is a story about the ruthless, dog-eat-dog of professional dancers in Vegas.  Right now I can't think of a more on-the-edge profession!<br /><br />The biggest selling point of the movie is its unabashed approach to nudity.  It has plenty of opportunities for nudity on-screen AND it takes them.  In fact, I believe this movie has more T & A per minute than any other movie I've ever seen.  Berkeley is topless through most of the movie.  She's also a great dancer with a natural dancer's body.  Gina Gershon is way sexy as well, although I didn't care for her fake Texas accent.<br /><br />IF you want to see a movie about strippers / dancers, you can't do better than this one.  This movie has often been compared to Demi Moore's STRIPTEASE.  To me, there is no comparison.  I found STRIPTEASE to be bland, boring & not a whole lot of nudity.  This flick is entertaining and will not shortchange you on the amount of skin it offers.
B000687M48|5.0|Amy Lee has a beautiful voice. It's pure art. As the singer of Evanescence in this DVD she paints the landscapes of this earth as they truly are, while bravely holding nothing back. She goes for it, which you got to give her credit for. Other artists and bands that I find similar to this collection...  I enjoy listening to gothic sensation, Corinna Fugate's voice soaring out from my speakers. Corinna Fugate has a voice like a warm rainbow pouring though sparkling crystal. I'm listening to Cold, a song about self mutilation, and getting better from it. Also been listening to Goodnight by the Beatles tonight.  <br />Music, favorite songs: Even In Death, Evanescence, Cold, Corinna Fugate, Hurt, NIN, and Johnny Cash, all spellbinding songs.  <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|From the crop fields of Arkansas, he shot to stardom revolutionizing country music while Elvis Presley was revolutionizing rock 'n' roll, he is the Man in Black, the one and only Johnny Cash. Joaquin Phonenix & Reese Witherspoon as Johnny & June Carter Cash in \\"Walk the Line\\" the true story of the country music legend and the woman who was all the music he ever loved. I see Oscar gold on this masterpiece, Phonenix on fire, he shines,hes marvelous and Witherspoon is an adorable,irresistable little thing. A beautiful onscreen couple. I see Oscar nominations for them both. It's electrifying musical experience to the eye,ear,heart & soul. See it, even if your not a Cash or Carter fan. It not's just the music, it's who performed it.

And it seemed in the old Justice League comics he was always the one to get beat up. In fact I only started watching the show because I discovered Braniac, one of my favorite villains [even though he's a Superman villain], would appear on the show in it's fifth season and, in the season opener, in the last 30 seconds of the show James Marsters as Braniac emerged from a spacecraft. From that moment on I was a fan of Smallville. It certainly is the greatest comic book adaptation ever created, and I am disappointed I wasn't a fan from the start. <br /> <br />It is a great start to one of the most entertaining Superman franchises I have ever seen. Great cast with superb acting and a super-sound track. Tom Welling is great at being a young Clark Kent, Kristin Kreuk is Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum is great at being a friendly yet shady Lex Luthor, Allison Mack is awesome as Chloe Sullivan, and Annette O'Toole and John Schneider play extremly likeable parents. I bet you're reading this and saying, \\"Wait what about Eric Johnson and Sam Jones III?\\" While they are good at playing their parts they somehow seem out of place, that is until Sam Jones makes his transition into the next season when Clark tells Pete [JONES III] his secret and Whitney [Johnson] leaves to join the Marines. It's then that things seem to even out a bit. John Glover definetly needed to be a star of the show this season, it's always a pleasure to see Lex's not so 'dear old dad.' <br /> <br />Overall a great series that, in my mind, hasn't been topped by any other adaptation.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Yes, this CD is the real deal, when i first heard it i was sitting in the living room, my feet on the dusty carpet, then i started playing the CD, the music began, i got up and couldn't control my feet, i was dancing like a mad on the carpet, the room was filled of dust, i wasn't able to see anything, i wasn't knowing where i was, that was such an experience!
B00000GV55|4.0|To give you an idea of what to expect, I'll say \\"1970's prog rock\\". But that doesn't come close to describing the music on this album.    Henry Cow generally came alongside the Mike  Oldfield / Virgin / Canterbury music heap of the late 60's and early 70's. But although you could compare the band with such as Soft Machine, Hatfield & The North, Caravan, etc., Henry Cow was on its own.    The band's music tends to be more intellectual or cerebral than most of their contemporaries.  It has elements of free-form jazz mixed with, say, pieces of Hans Werner Henze, but not those alone.  There is also an occasional flavor of politics (musical and otherwise). Of other musicians, the closest that I could mention are Bjrk and Robert Wyatt, chiefly because they are also unique artists.    I've listened to Leg End a great deal over the last thirty years, and I see it as one of the very few 'progressive' albums of the 1970's that sounds just as fresh and new in 2005.    Leg End is a reissue on CD of an earlier vinyl LP, but it's not a simple remastering to digital. Fred Frith reworked it to some extent.  The most obvious difference is a very brief section in the first minute of the first track. He's either brought something to the fore, or added something that wasn't there before, and the whole impression that it now gives me is Yuck. But that's only a five second Yuck.  Enough \\"Y?\\", but not enough \\"uck!\\" to get in my way, and it shouldn't prevent you from buying this album if you've heard the original.    The music has vague reflections of other musicians' work that was produced before, during, and after the time of Leg End's first release. Here are only four of them, to give you an idea:  Miles Davis (the Bitches Brew era).  The Soft Machine (Third).  Centipede (Septober Energy).  Frank Zappa (various, mostly his live albums).    This is a concept album, but not the kind of 'concept' you'd expect from a band like Yes. Some of the tracks are contiguous with adjacent tracks, others are not.  But the whole thing moves from start to finish like a meal.   Different people will find different parts to relish; there are parts that you might think are difficult, and others are easily appreciated on their first hearing.   Listening to it from beginning to end in one sitting will eventually help you recognize the structure that runs through the album.   That's the only way you'll get to grips with the entire thing.    Amazon says there are eight tracks.  Strange. There are ten tracks on mine.     *** Here's a brief note I've added later to define that.  My CD is a British release, not identical to this one and not the 1999 remix that one reviewer referred to.  Compared with the original 1973 vinyl, there's only the single brief Frith tweak in the first track, and the addition of Bellycan. But my comments about the music are still correct, so...        Here's my track by track impression, for what it's worth:    Nirvana for Mice:  The introductory track shows Frith's reworking most (the brief tinkling keyboard a short way into the track). The initial theme becomes a freeform section featuring saxophone, although the other instruments support it with obvious individuality.    Amygdala:  Somewhat freeform, with structured individual sections. Some are melodic and haunting, especially those with interwoven flute, guitar, and piano. Some are agile mixes of the instruments. Bass guitar and percussion and bass support throughout excellently. If there's a track that represents the entire album, this is it.    Teenbeat Introduction/Teenbeat:  From freeform, at times atmospheric, reeds and wind, hints of a theme emerge.  As the other instruments join, the music becomes increasingly cohesive and a strong theme emerges that flows directly into Teenbeat.  Teenbeat is clearer and more thoughtful than the preceding tracks, with the members working very closely at each change. At times lighthearted, dense, playful and mournful, it's enjoyable throughout and shows how creative the band was collectively and individually, and how capable it was of producing emotional music.    Nirvana Reprise:  Frith's guitar, overdubbed, repeats a theme that appeared in Nirvana For Mice. As brief as this track is - a little over one minute - this is a simply beautiful and pure piece of music.    Extract From 'With The Yellow Half Moon And Blue Star':  All the instruments working together, not a definable pattern but a musical painting. There are parts that make me think of Mike Oldfield, but he could never produce this.  It takes several musicians working individually and together to get this good. The track flows into...    Teenbeat Reprise:  Not a repeat of Teenbeat, but a supplement to it.  The same comments apply as before.    The Tenth Chaffinch:  The track's beginning is ethereal, almost ambient, but it then becomes something with parts that remind me of Larks' Tongues In Aspic (King Crimson) and the Krautrock of Faust. It's more brooding than the other tracks.    Nine Funerals Of The Citizen King:  A song, with somewhat surreal and philosophical/political lyrics. Structured, but still Henry Cow, especially the instrumental section. One of my favorite tracks, it's separate from the ones either side of it.  This is reminiscent of Robert Wyatt's songwriting of the Matching Mole and Truth Is Stranger Than Richard era.  RW and HC were no strangers, anyway.     Bellycan:  This is the only track that wasn't on the original LP, but it doesn't seem to be a random afterthought or something put in to help pad out the empty space.  A quiet start becomes loosely structured with random contributions from band members. Some lovely guitar work from Frith.    If you listen to the track previews on Amazon or elsewhere, you will only hear brief snips. You will NOT get much of an idea about all the music on this album. But if you ever buy this based on the previews, you will grow to love it.     I first gave it a four, because some folk might find it toodense on their first hearing.  If it seems like that to you, listen to it from start to finish without a break, and repeat ad lib. It definitely grows on you.  After hearing it off and on for so long, I find myself humming or whistling parts of it, with my brain filling in the other instruments. Weird.      I'd give it a six, but I'll have to be content with a five if Amazon accepts the new rating.    A good album to listen to after Leg End would be the live double Concerts.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Seems like old times.  Madonna is exactly where she belongs, on the dancefloor.  Is it 1985 again.  Having been a huge Madonna fan spanning her entire career, I know a thing or two about her.  This is quite possibly her best album yet.  Lyrically it falls a bit short sometimes and it may be a tad preachy, but we've come to expect that of her.  What this album has are very strong, very danceable beats.  This IS dance music, actual dance music, not Madonna's interpretation of what she thought dance music was on her Ray Of Light and Music albums.  It's as if she remixed her own music before putting it on an album.  You could actually picture yourself dancing to this album in a club.  Love the fact that the songs blend into one another.  The centerpiece of the album \\"Forbidden Love/Jump\\" is brilliant, \\"Jump\\" being a chill inducing masterpiece that is a throw back to classic Madonna with it's self-empowerment themed lyrics. \\"Jump\\" may be one of Madonna's best songs EVER! Disregard the lack luster reviews you may encounter about this album.  For true Madonna fans this album represents what we love about Madonna.  This album IS Madonna!
0307276902|5.0|\\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" by James Frey is an intense and perfectly detailed account of a human quitting his drug and alcohol dependency. James Frey is horribly honest and funny in a young-guard Eggers and Wallace sort of way, but perhaps more contained and measured. He is unerring in his decent into a world where the characters need help in such extremely desperate ways. Read This Immediately.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Can you believe this stupidity, can anyone say SLUT much? I can, and I think this is just disappointing that CD's and singers like this get made SUPER famous, when they can't even SING! <br /> <br />  Whats wrong with listening to Anthony Warlow or Linda Edner? They can sing!  They can sing and they can grab an audience, unlike little miss teeny boper, I'm a virgin moron.  I don't want someone like Brittany putting any sort of impression upon children, and yet she's given that ability.  The only thing she does is throw the women back to the stoneage of being a sex object.  I'm not a mega super femi person, but GEESH I would like respect! <br /> <br />As I said this sucks, and there are FAR better singers, hell my eighty year old half deaf grandmother can carry a better tune then Brittany! <br /> <br />Michelle <br />(huggles her grandmother) Gotta love her :)
B00004TS0E|4.0|A really enjoyed this film from start to finish and I think it's one of the best christmas movies. I forget the original movie but I remember this one beeing better. The film is slow at times which is a downfall for kids I think they'll be board lots in the film. The story is about a girl who dosent believe in Santa Clause and a department store santa Clause thinks he's the real thing. The movie is good becouse all the miracles that happen in the  book can happen (there far feteched but it's a movie) so we still think is he really Santa or a nice man. The film is a real treat and all the actors do great jobs.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I stayed away from this album up till now because of the overwhelminly negative reviews it garnered and because I couldn't stand the title track when it first came out on radio. A few weeks ago though, I heard two tracks on this album -- nothing fails and x-static process -- and was amazed not only at how different they sounded from Madonna's other stuff, but also at the depth of feeling conveyed in the spare lyrics and production. Hearing these songs made me want to listen to the rest of album, which to my surprise showed a degree of artistry, mature sensibility and vision that is very rare in most pop music. And within the context of the album, the title track sounds a lot better. For me, this album is not the stinker it was labeled as when it first came out.  <br /> <br />P.S. I understand that not everone will like this album. I understand that many will want to give it a low score. What I don't understand are all those whose critique of the album amounts to dissing the performer's looks and/or age. By all means criticize the work. But please... enough with all the sexist, ageist garbage remarks.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|Maybe I watched the original movie too much as a kid, but for me, it just didn't feel like this film had a heart. It's just flat out boring.  <br /> <br />I was surpised - coming from Tim Burton - to see so much computerized special effects. The technically precise, glossy makeover to the film loses some of it's original charm. <br /> <br />Aside from all that, the film is beautifully transferred to DVD. There is no noticable film grain or compression artifacts. The surround sound is very nice as well.
B0006399FS|4.0|I was part of the Tx postpunk scene, so U2 were seen as sellouts to us in their 80s days.  Everyone though, could recognize a brilliant album like Joshua Tree, though it was their last album with punk or postpunk as a foundation stone.  It also marked a time to move on, and postpunk was soon homogenized for shopping mall crowds like you, as 'alternative'.   <br /> <br />Everything since seems like U2 are following, rather than leading.  This record is no different.  Their association with iPOD etc is sort of silly, but does not mean Vertigo is a bad song.  Now they dress like teens or punks, which is kinda sad bc they were once authentically part of the punk scene.  I guess their avg listener is still 15 so this is needed. <br /> <br />Miracle Drug, All bc of You also great, but U2 could write songs like this forever.  If any other group had just one of these songs on an album, it would be raved about.  But bc U2 write sweeping emotive songs side by side, dozen at a time, it dilutes their impact.  This is a virtual twin of All That You Cant Leave Behind by the way.
B000BGH22W|4.0|This soundtrack to the latest Harry Potter film is quite possibly the best yet. This is the first score of the Potter films not be composed by John Williams, who declined to do this film so that he could compose the music for the upcoming \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" (You mean there are other composers besides John Williams???? The Madness!!!). Okay, that's a bit extreme, but I'm getting annoyed with people talking like John Williams is the be-all end-all in movie composing. Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of his work (duh... Star Wars), but it's nice to get some variety on occasion. I've personally found his work on the previous Potter films a bit too whimsical for my tastes. Further, as the characters grow older and mature and the material gets darker, I would expect some of the whimsy to give away for a daker, more serious sound. This is precisely what Patrick Doyle does in Goblet of Fire (though Williams did do a good job on \\"Askaban\\"). You do find yourself missing the familiar themes a bit in this film (though the main \\"Hedwig Theme\\" does pop in and out on occasion), but Patrick's Doyle's score breathes some fresh air into the series. If you haven't heard his stuff before, look at his work on Kenneth Branagh's film versions of Shakespeare's \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" or \\"Henry V\\" to taste his typical sound.    Anyway, Doyle creates an impressive gothic sound that lends itself very well to this type of movie, and his music fits in quite well into the existing score we're used to. \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" is an exhilerating and fun piece, espeically the later half that denotes the Durmstrang school and Victor Krum. \\"The Golden Egg\\" is also quite good, a triumphant piece that's very appropraite for the action of the 1st task. \\"Harry In Winter\\" takes a more serious tone and reflects Harry's emotional toil and his emotional solitude. \\"Voldemort\\" becomes even darker and takes us through to the climax of the film. \\"Hogwarts' Hymn\\" is perhaps the best track on the CD, and charactarises the emtional tone of the film perfectly.    This soundtrack gets 4 stars and not 5 is for 2 reasons. First, while not that bad actually, the extra 3 rock tracks at the end of the CD don't add much really (they're really there because of a story element where there's a rock band at a winter ball). Also, I'm always dissapointed when they don't add end credits music to a CD, and (unlike the previous Potter soundtracks) this one doesn't (or at least the part that I heard on my way out of the theater).     As soon as I heard Doyle was composing this score, I was immediately excited, and this result has not dissapointed me. In fact, I'd probably rank it as my favorite Potter score to date, and I welcome his future involvement in the series. However, if Williams is available for the future films, I don't doubt that he'll return to score those films, so the Williams' groupies need not worry...

0151008116|5.0|The Story of Pi Patel's journey through the Pacific Ocean is a medley of many timeless themes beautifully interwoven to create a series of enlightenments. I love the way the author explores these themes by diving deep into the components of human character with use of analogies, metaphors, logos, and personification. In one instance Pi analyzes the effects of fear, after noticing the fear he feels towards the 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, by concluding \\"Quickly you make rash decisions. You dismiss your last allies: hope and trust. There, you've defeated yourself. Fear, which is but an impression, has triumphed over you\\" (Martel, 162). The diction and logic Martel uses in exploring concepts is easy to follow and leaves an impression. Another reason why I love this novel is because the writer's style and descriptions make it very easy for the reader to put him or herself into Pi's shoes. The first-person, narrative layout makes it especially easy for the readers mind to become Pi's. When Pi went blind my world went dark and I feared for my life; When Pi froze in the open ocean, I shivered. Pi's logic and constant thought and comparison of his circumstances to religion, life, and existence, is very similar to the way I think and I was therefore able to connect with Pi very well. Also Martel's novel depicts the human psyche very realistically. Pi, being a very religious individual, almost begs the reader for forgiveness, after he describes his state of starvation and regretfully slipping a piece of human flesh into his mouth. He says,  \\"I mean small pieces, little strips for the gaff's hook,...slipped into my mouth nearly unnoticed. You must understand, my suffering was unremitting and he was already dead. I stopped as soon as I caught a fish. I pray for his soul every day\\" (Martel, 256). To me, this story was beautiful, horrifying, amazing, tragic, and at times hilarious; I loved this story and I will read more of this writers work. <br /> <br />

B000BKJ78K|1.0|The only reason I'm wasting fifteen minutes writing this is that Matthew DeLuca's rant made me laugh.  He goes on and on about how upset he is that George is double-dipping, then finishes by saying he'll probably end up buying it anyway.  Spare me.   <br /> <br />And to those of you commenting on the double-dip, so what?  The only reason Lucas can get away with this, is because you people keep buying them.  Exactly how many copies of the same film do you need?   <br /> <br />If I were Lucas I'd be doing the same exact thing, because I know, apparently like he does, that the idiots will complain, but they will also buy it.  <br /> <br />They're movies people.  They're fun to watch.  They're fantasy.  Nothing more.  Han Solo isn't real.  There is no force.  Darth Vader is not really Luke's father.    <br /> <br />Go complain about something that actually matters, or better yet, actually do something that matters.  Debating the good and bad of the new versions versus the old, or that Lucas is repackaging again - are you kidding?  You don't like it - quit buying it. <br /> <br />Alright, this only took eight minutes.  I have seven more minutes to waste before returning to the real world.   <br /> <br />Well I'm off to make fun of the Matrix geeks. . .

B000B2YQX4|5.0|There are a couple of songs on this album that have already made my \\"all-time DM favorites\\" list: \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"The Darkest Star\\". Those two have a dark intensity about them that would be right at home on a classic DM album such as Violator. That's a big turnaround from their last release, Exciter, which took me quite a while to get used to (I still think the general *sound* of Exciter is lacking something).  <br /> <br />With Playing the Angel, the band proves they can still pull off that classic sound that made me a fan in the first place. Songs like \\"Lillian\\" and \\"I Want It All\\" are good examples, and those have quickly grown on me too. It's interesting to note that two out of the four songs I've singled out so far were written by Dave Gahan (\\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"I Want It All\\"). This is the first DM album he has written for, and if the trend continues, it's a good sign for the future of the band. His other track, \\"Nothing's Impossible\\", also has potential to stand out after repeated listenings. <br /> <br />The first two tracks on the disc, \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" and \\"John the Revelator\\", have a strong Songs of Faith and Devotion feel to them, and even though they aren't my favorites, they still get some play time in the car. The only songs that miss their mark just happen to be the two sung by Martin Gore: \\"Macro\\" and \\"Damaged People\\". This is strange, because I normally really like his songs (\\"Judas\\" and \\"Home\\" are amazing). The lyrics to \\"Macro\\" are just awkward. It's hard to imagine they were penned by the same guy who wrote the simple yet elegant lyrics of \\"Precious\\". \\"Damaged People\\" has a great-sounding chorus, but the lyrics (especially the verse sections) have that over-dramatic, almost comical 'goth' feel to them that really turns me off (reminiscent of \\"The Dead of Night\\" from Exciter).  <br /> <br />Despite those two low points, I have to give this album five stars because the songs that I DO like, I feel they rank up their with the best of anything Depeche Mode has ever done. I'm not sure how they will fare in the current popular music scene, but that doesn't matter to me. As a long-time, hardcore fan, I'm just happy to hear they've still got the touch.
B000BGH22W|2.0|I actually don't have this soundtrack, and will never buy it.  Why?  Because I really, really dislike the music in the fourth movie. <br />I saw the movie of course, and spent quite a bit of time hissing to my friends, \\"What's the deal with this music?  It's like a daytime soap or something!  Where's the Harry Potter theme?\\"  I stayed to watch the credits, and, sure enough, John Williams has clearly disappeared. <br />I work at a movie theatre, and I must say that the orchestral music at the end of Disney's \\"Chicken Little\\" sounds more like Harry Potter music than the music at the end of the Harry Potter film. <br />I am not happy with this new music at all--it actually distracted me from the movie.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have a $200 framed poster of Madonna on my living room wall, so I'll try not to be biased or anything, BUT...this CD is sheer bliss!  Madonna has combined her own work with assembled bits of disco and other diverse and futuristic sounds to make an album that I rank right up there with my favorites, \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Ray Of Light\\".  In fact, many of the cuts have the \\"Erotica\\" sound, and that is no problem to me at all.  But there are other reasons to love this album.  What a pleasure (and stroke of genius on Maddie's part) to hear ABBA all over the airwaves again on \\"Hung Up\\", one of the best cuts.  \\"Jump\\" sounds a lot like classic, vintage Madonna, but updated for The Now.  And \\"Push\\" is a serious, aggressive tribute to the divine \\"Guy\\" in her life.  (Madonna, being a goddess herself, could only be happy with another divinity.)  Most of the lyrics are about the same as on other Madonna albums.  They contribute to the songs, but they don't make or break them.  The music does that.  Even though this is dance music, the album as a whole has a rather serious tone, as opposed to frivolous. And, the tracks are skillfully structured so there are no gaps between them, which gives the album unity and thus enhances its impact. I want to thank The Lady for welding the Past to the Future and giving us a treat, vibrant and really MUSICAL, to sink our teeth into, a rare thing these days.  And, she gets credit for injecting fun, glamour and definitive pop into our lives for over 20 years (so far).  I hope the Grammys recognize this album.  I don't see how they could miss it, but then, I'm the guy with the framed poster on my wall...

B0000024PC|5.0|Before you buy this, listen to the samples first.  In an echo of previous reviews, I agree that this is not a comprehensive Simon and Garfunkel album, nor is it meant to be.  This is a collection of contrasts, an example of the Generation Gap as represented through the eyes of Benjamin Braddock.  In the musical juxstaposition of youth and middle age, modernism and antiquity, we experience the '60's just before the \\"Age of Aquarius\\" and psychedelia.  This is a wonderfully novel album, good for cocktail parties and conversation; a blast from the past, if you will.  If lounge music is your bag, invest in this classic.  It is pretty groovy in that makes unhipness hip, in a very retro sort of way.  It inspires me to put on my mini skirt and get out the martini shaker.  It is great to put in a shuffle mix with some Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and a S&G disc like \\"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, & Thyme\\".  Talk about a taste of two worlds...Enjoy.

B00005JN0T|2.0|Does anyone else besides me feel that INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996) was an unbelievably contrived (and expensive) piece of hooey that somehow caught the public's fancy? Well, if you can't get enough of Will Smith and noisy action sequences, it's time to fall to your knees and praise the cinematic gods: I, ROBOT is every bit as loud, overblown, and in-your-face as you hoped it would be. But it's also a little more imaginative and thrilling than expected, so the unconverted can be thankful for small favors. <br />     <br />This science fiction thriller is \\"suggested by\\" Isaac Asimov's thought-provoking science fiction stories from the book of the same title, which is like saying that a chopped steak \\"suggests\\" the cow it came from. There's no point in complaining that the film bears no resemblance to its source material; anyone who's seen the theatrical trailer should have immediately realized that there's little connection between the two. So to carp on this matter would be like admitting to your own inattentiveness. <br />     <br />Set in a futuristic Chicago of 2035, Will Smith-giving a performance that ensures you won't forget he was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air-is a cop who suspects a revolution brewing among the army of robots that have been manufactured to serve mankind. Is anyone watching the movie really surprised when it turns out he's right?  <br />     <br />Like many contemporary blockbusters, I, ROBOT is brimming with more money than ideas, though unlike many films of this ilk, at least it has ideas. Not all of these ideas pay off (you'll lose count of all the illogical twists and turns the plot takes), but it's not an entirely unpleasant time-waster, either. It generates enough excitement to maintain your interest, although perhaps not enough to make you want to own a DVD of it.
B000BGH22W|4.0|I really enjoyed this soundtrack! I bought it expecting the worst, and found that I really liked it!  <br /> <br />I know a lot of people are upset over the fact that John Willams didn't do this one and while nothing compares to the first three soundtracks, this one isn't bad either. I like the new sound with a bit of the traditional mixed in as well.  <br /> <br />I think it's nice that as the characters storyline grows and develops, so does the music. It's nice to try something new. Who knows, maybe John Willams will be back for the next one. <br /> <br />Overall, a great soundtrack! I even enjoyed the three songs from the movie, well two out of three anyway.
B00000I8BX|5.0|Fear Factory's first two albums were extremely heavy (more death metal than industrial); so 1998's \\"Obsolete\\" was the first album that really showed the band evolving. \\"Obsolete,\\" which is a concept album about machines overcoming mankind, also showcases Fear Factory in their finest form. It's not as heavy as \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\" or \\"Demanufacture,\\" but saying it's \\"watered down\\" is a ridiculous statement. This is heavy metal with an industrial edge. Sure, the blowtorch guitars and heavy drumming remain in tact, but a lot more spacious, futuristic sounding keyboards and clean, backing vocals to be heard here, as well. And some of this album, like the mysterious song \\"Timelessness,\\" is almost pretty, even.<br /><br />Tracks one and three have punching riffs which are backed by a pounding blast beat, and drummer Raymond Herrera really shines on \\"Securitron\\" and \\"Hi-Tech Hate.\\" The former track begins with more thunderous double kick work, and \\"Hi-Tech Hate\\" has all around amazing drumming. Track two, \\"Edgecrusher,\\" is a very infectious tune which is therefore one of the band's most famous and a fan favorite. Finally, the title track begins with a robotic voice murmuring things like \\"Man is obsolete.\\" The actual song begins, however, and has fiery riffs, thumping drum beats, and a catchy chant of the title phrase.<br /><br />As far as the bonus tracks go, they're all pretty good, and definitely worth owning. \\"Cars\\" is frowned upon by many fans, because it's an electronic toe-tapper that sounds like its straight off of MTV. Fortunately, \\"O-O\\" has explosive choruses and almost monstrous vocals, and \\"Soulwound,\\" \\"Messiah,\\" and \\"Concreto\\" all sound quite awesome.<br /><br />\\"Obsolete\\" has my vote for being Fear Factory's finest release. It's simply great industrial metal, and it also has plenty of heavy stuff to please fans of the old-school. Plus, if you're new to FF, this is a great place to start.
B0007CNXUK|2.0|\\"..just a bit of silliness, really...\\" is a line from the movie describing a conversation between Peter and Barrie. And that really could be a more apt description of this movie. This script is a complete fabrication out of the minds of the script writers, with a lot of marketing thrown in by the Corporate sponsors to make sure this movie is a sellable to Middle America. As anyone who has read a biography of Barrie knows, his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family was very complicated, and not entirely innocent. Not the least important defect of the movie script is that it's inaccurate about even the most basic of details about Barrie and his involvment with this family. For instance, Barrie first became involved with the Llewlyn Davies family when the father was still alive and living with the family. But the most grevious defect of the movie is portraying Barrie's interest in the children as entirely innocent. The original book \\"Peter Pan\\" was actually an adult fairy tale by a subliminated pedophile. The movie is no more a reflection of Barrie's relationship with these kids and their mother then Disney's cartoon version of \\"Peter Pan\\" bore a relationship to the original story. The little boys in their little outfits with their knee breeches are wholesome and cute, and Barry's relationship with the boy's mother is pure fatherly concern for the welfare of his boys. Yeah, we've heard that one before! Shades of Wacko Jacko Jackson, and his ranch, \\"Neverland\\", more exactly. This is a good video for parents to buy who were entertained by the Disney version of Peter Pan, and want to follow up with a movie that 'the whole family can view\\". But frankly, there are better ways to entertain and enlighten your kids then this movie, or Disney fantasies like Peter Pan.
B0001CCXZW|4.0|Gilmore Girls is a great show exploring the relationship between a 32-year old mom and her 16-year-old daughter.  I think it is great that more and more shows are exploring the positive aspects of different kinds of relationships.  Everwood is a show about a father (trying to be one) and his angry, resentful son. Gilmore Girls explores the single mom dynamic and does it very, very well.<br /><br />Most of the credit, although the cast is very good from top to bottom, has to go to Lauren Graham.  She's without question one of the best actresses on television today.  She is fast, witty, and has a charismatic personality that draws you in.  Scott Cohen (Max Medina) states in the interviews, \\"If you're going to act across from Lauren Graham, you'd better bring your 'A' game, because she'll leave you in the dust otherwise.\\"  She plays a cheerful, exciting mom who drinks coffee by the bucketful, loves to eat pizza and chocolate, and runs a small Inn in the town of Star's Hollow.  I'm not a girl, but I can quickly imagine that Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is the kind of mom that many girls envision for themselves.  She's more than a mom to her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel), she's her best friend.  Don't think that Lorelai is soft on her daughter when Rory finds herself in a pickle or has done something wrong, as Lorelai can quickly shift to a very concerned and disappointed mother.<br /><br />Cast includes Scott Patterson (Luke) who runs a small diner.  He doesn't talk much, but it's obvious that there is a connection between he and Lorelai.  Their witty banter is some of the best on television.<br /><br />There's Melissa McCarthy (Suki), Lorelai's friend and cook at the Inn.  She's a bubbly, energetic woman who's a bit clumsy despite her great culinary abilities, such as accidentally smashing a pan into the face of another chef.<br /><br />There's Yanic Truesdale as the Inn's stuffy, French concierge who believes everyone else is a fool.  Great character and wonderfully played by Yanic.<br /><br />Also, there is Keiko Agena as Rory's Korean best friend, Lane.<br /><br />Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop play Lorelai's wealthy parents who live in Hartford, Connecticuit.  Both are fantastic actors and great additions to the show.<br /><br />Alexis Bledel is the new-comer to acting.  Therefore, I cannot fault her for her portrayal of Rory Gilmore as a bit wooden and lacking a certain charisma.  This is most evident in the first half of the season.  Alexis picks up quick though, as she quickly is able to get a handle on her character.  I haven't seen any of the other seasons, so I'm going to assume that things improve for her.  She never takes away from the show, however.  But many times, seasoned actors can inadvertently show a contrast to someone who has little acting experience.<br /><br />The town of Star's Hollow is the kind of place I've always dreamed of living.  It's fun, friendly, and has all the characters of a small town.  Season 1 focuses on Lorelai's re-connection with her parents as well as Rory's getting to know her grandparents.  It also focuses on possible romances for both women.<br /><br />People may assume that this is a \\"girl's\\" show.  You'd be selling it short if you arrive at this conclusion without seeing it.  The acting is superb, the stories delightful, and the atmosphere fun and charming.<br /><br />Give the Gilmore Girls a chance, and you'll find as I did, that they very quickly grow on you.lly played by Yanic. <br /> <br />Also, there is Keiko Agena as Rory's Korean best friend, Lane. <br /> <br />Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop play Lorelai's wealthy parents who live in Hartford, Connecticuit.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM BY THE QUEEN OF POP IN YEARS. THE ALL FUSED TRACKS FLOW TOGETHER WONDERFULLY. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE SINGLE \\"HUNG UP\\" I ALMOST GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND BEGAN TO \\"GET INTO THE GROOVE\\".  <br />AS A FAN OF MADONNA THROUGHOUT HE ENTIRE CAREER, I HAVE NEVER DISLIKED ANYTHING SHE HAS EVER DONE.

B000AP04NI|2.0|Like many people, I was looking forward to the 50th Anniversary Edition of OKLAHOMA!  I was surprised to find the Todd-AO transfer to be a mess.  Grainy, dark and muddy is the best way to describe the picture.  I sincerely hope FOX will offer a recall on these discs. <br /> <br />In the meantime, I will be watching my ten year old Laserdisc, also mastered from the Todd-AO print.  Although not enhanced for a widescreen TV, this edition has excellent picture and sound. <br /> <br />It is a small consolation that the second disc in the DVD set includes a great featurette on the difference between CinemaScope and Todd-AO.  This features the use of a video process called \\"Smilebox\\" that simulates the curved screen used in the original Todd-AO releases.  It also features the two short subjects made to show-off the Todd-AO process.  For this reason alone, I'll rate this set 2 stars. <br /> <br />Perhaps FOX will realize the errors of their ways and correct the problem with this DVD.

0897500482|5.0|There are countless publications available on JKD and Bruce Lee. But, this book remains the de facto bible of JKD. <br /> <br />Bruce Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do is an extraordinary glimpse into the mind and spirit of the most celebrated martial artist in history. Clearly, this book is an exemplary guide to the fighting philosophy and concepts of JKD. However, the level of elegance and wisdom conveyed by Bruce Lee in this bestseller is most riveting. <br /> <br />Had Bruce Lee written this book ten years prior or ten years after its actual completion, the results would have been uniquely different. That is the essence of JKD...as well as the essence of human life...constant evolution of the mind, body, and spirit. <br /> <br />Because Bruce Lee wrote the bulk of this book while he was physically still (he sustained a back injury that kept him in bed for six months), his mind was able to fully engage in the writings that have resulted in Tao of Jeet Kune Do. As was the case with nearly everything he produced when fully engaged...Bruce Lee succeeded in creating a timeless masterpiece that will inspire and enlighten martial artists for generations to come. <br /> <br />J.

B00005JO1P|4.0|What is most intriguing about the new Johnny Cash biopic is how Joaquin Phoenix does more of an impressionistic take on the Man in Black rather than the dead-on impersonation that Jaime Foxx did as Ray Charles, or going further back, that Gary Busey did as Buddy Holly. Although Phoenix lacks Cash's craggy features and full-throated delivery, there is enough resemblance vocally and physically for him to get away with it. Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film. When he performs onstage, it is not so much the musicality that gets you but the often scary glare he gives as a tortured soul. Whether destroying a dressing room or feeling ill-at-ease with his stoic parents, it's a powerfully unrelenting performance that evokes Cash's spirit, albeit one that is sometimes too off-putting and humorless over the course of a 136-minute film.<br /><br />Recent biopics seem to be following similar dramatic patterns. Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to \\"Ray\\" in treatment - a rural childhood, a demanding parent, a transformative childhood trauma, adultery, drug addiction. However, to Mangold's and co-writer Gill Dennis's credit, he does not go back and forth to Cash's childhood to make us understand his pain. Instead, he deals with it succinctly upfront and uses the periodic reappearance of his parents as the emotional link. The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core. Cash's incessant, decade-long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real-life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern-fried sensibility. What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in \\"Vanity Fair\\" or her overachieving half-spirit in \\"Just Like Heaven\\",  are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks. She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially \\"Jackson\\", are among the movie's best moments. Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing. As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no-nonsense nurturing that attracts our attention more than Phoenix's doleful responses.<br /><br />It's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real-life performers or the actors portraying them. Some voices are so recognizable as to defy impersonation (e.g., using Ray Charles' original tracks in \\"Ray\\"). Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter.  Credit needs to go to T. Bone Burnett for training them so well for six months. There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.<br /><br />The movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm-singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small-minded shrew. Like all-fact-based movies, the movie can also feel episodic, and it does sag somewhat in the middle as the film belabors Cash's amphetamine addiction. Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood filmmaking with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.erspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.
0553801503|3.0|Most people agree:  the writing is still great, but the pace is slower.  Even many of the five star reviews grant that the pace is slower.  I jumped in greedily, and had fun reading, but after four hundered pages or so, i began to wonder when the really good stuff was gonna happen.  Bottom line, this just isn't as good as the other three.  Some have said here that it is natural to have this pace in this book.  Others have said 700 pages of setup are unnecessary, and i agree.  I think of Jhiqui saying, \\"That is known.\\" and Irri agreeing, \\"It is known.\\" (two characters i forgot even existed, as well as the cultural phrase they love to employ, but forgetting such details plagues me.)    Martin is consciously aware of what he leaves in and leaves out.  Take Sam's journey to Oldtown.  Many days are skipped, like when Martin tells us, \\"then there were five more days of rain,\\" or some such.  Other events with other characters are kept off the page as well, but are referred to as having happened later on.  My point simply is, despite admitting Martin is a better writer than me and all that, i'm not sure he always chose to write the right things here, like the most interesting things.  Many things could have been skipped or shortened without me losing my emotional connection to characters, or losing my sense of what was going on.  I'm never fully aware of what's going on anyway.  This world is so complex and richly detailed, i've come to the point where i don't even try to remember all the minor names thrown at me.  In fact, it got to the point (but it did take a while) where i was losing interest due to the excessive machinations and historical and genealogical details.    Still, i enjoy reading Martin's work.  While there is some fear expressed by many that he may be following the path of Jordan, i have to say, Cersei's paranoid mistrust of almost everyone around her hasn't grown old and annoying like Nynaeve's braid tugging, for one example.  Cersei hasn't become a stalecaricature of herself. Martin infuses his work with such great character development and so many funny lines that it's hard not to stay entertained.    One harsh reviewer humorously outlined in nutshells what issues each character seemed to be repetitively grappling with in their respective chapters, and while he had a point, that feeling of repetitiveness never sank in with me.  So i'm conflicted, like many here seem to be.  I enjoyed reading this book, but the pace was slower.  Big things did happen, to be sure, but it didn't feel like big things were happening (maybe because many big things happened mostly off the page).  It felt like too much setup, filler, too many details that began to feel irrelevant.    It's almost like many chapters are short stories strung together on the thread of several main characters.  So many small characters pop up, many of which have fascinating stories, but besides adding texture to the complex world, how did they advance the plot?  I'm thinking of people like Septon Meribald and Nimble Dick.  i dunno.  There's a balance that must be struck.  I love the portraits of small, downtrodden, sad, regular folk caught up in what's going on, but on the other hand, the plot is not moving forward with them.  i think that's why i feel like there are many short stories here within the novel.  Brienne really was the one to bring us most of these portraits in her search for Sansa, continually running into people who had been adversely affected by the war.  She was our connection to the people i guess.    Anyway, a few other points.  I didn't get through all the reviews here, but i didn't see mentioned how female power is such a major theme in this novel.  Cersei is angry that women can't have the power, Arianne is fretting the same thing, so is Asha, and Brienne is always worried about her sexual identity with men always thinking she should get back to being a maid.  And of course Daenerys is the one is who is going to come back and kick everyone's butts, presumably.  but of course the great thing about Martin is, you have no idea what is going to happen.  Anyway, it's like one big women's liberation movement forming.  Just something to think about.     I too share the fear that because the next book overlaps with this one nothing much is gonna happen, but A Dance With Dragons does suggest more excitement than A Feast for Crows.  Daenerys is on the other side of the world, and all kinds of crazy stuff could be happening there.  Maybe the Others (I wonder if the writers of Lost were inspired by Martin in naming their mysterious island people?) were storming the Wall while we were reading about Cersei's descent into insanity.  I'd like to see more chapters with Arya and Brienne because those cliffhangers can't wait two to four years.    Which brings me to another point, one raised by others here.  Are we gonna have any heroes emerge?  Poor Brienne, i thought she was gonna make it.  Maybe someone will pass the breath of life on to her, or Clint Eastwood shows up and shoots the rope.  I'm holding out hope for Jon.  The bastard son could become the big hero, or maybe in the middle of furious plotting as he walks along the Wall, he slips and falls to his doom.  With all the bad things happening to good people, i did begin to despair.  As the reader, i feel like the grizzled veteran.  The new recruit shows up, and he's a good guy, trying to make friends, but i give him the cold shoulder, because i don't make friends with dead people.  It's easier on my heart, the downside being i become distant or indifferent.    This uncertainty does makes for great drama, though.  No one is safe.  Nothing dropped my jaw like the Red Wedding, which i can say without hyperbole, was one of the greatest plot twists of all time.  That scene forgave anything negative i might have said about that book, washed it from my memory.  I never wanted to throw down this book in disgust, but this was the first book of the series where i thought, wow, this isn't the roller coaster, this is the merry-go-round.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Everyone knows she doesn't have the best voice, why can't people move past that!?!?! Madonna's voice isn't great either and Janet Jacksons is just as weak!!! Britney doesn't hold a candle to Mariahs, Celines, or crack head whitneys vocals, but she provides a pop star that gives people something to enjoy without having to be serious. Its pop music for crying out loud! Its supposed to be fun and carefree.  <br />Britneys carrer has so far spanned seven years and within those years she has released four albums, a tv show, countless music videos, a movie, pepsi commercials, three books, headlined four tours, a doll, and most importantly hit singles. She has been the most controversial pop singer since Madonna with her lolita like image, including a Rolling Stone cover in her undies when she was just 17!! Britney has accompished what some only dream of. But when it comes down to it, its the music that will matter. <br />This Greatest Hits collection brings together her biggest hits and several new songs that are just as strong. <br /> <br />My Prerogative: Greatest Hits- <br />1. My Prerogative - A Bobby Brown cover that is superior. Britney makes the song more personal to her hectic life and she delivers it with plenty of 'tude and sex appeal. Its a great song! 10/10 <br />2. Toxic - One of Britneys most memorable hits. The dance song delivered a different pop sound with her vocals and crazy violins. The sexy video didnt hurt either. Extremley catchy and fun. 10/10 <br />3. Im A Slave 4 u - Another huge Britney hit. This was Britneys first sexually charged single that had no shame! Her slinky R&b beat and heavy breathing really tunrs up the heat in this hot song. 10/10 <br />4. Oops I did It Again - Britneys toungue in cheeck song about being a tease. Another huge hit, the song is a sassy pop song that remains sweet. 10/10 <br />5. Me Against The Music - A great dance song. A bit cheesy but tons of fun. That chorus is hypnotizing and fun to sing along with. Britneys first hard core dance song. 10/10 <br />6. Stronger - Britneys most independent single from the early days. The song was much edgier than her poppier pack back than, the song is a classic and one of her best. 10/10 <br />7. Everytime - Britneys song writing at its best. the song is haunting and really depressing. A great contrast to the more upbeat hits. 10/10 <br />8. ... Baby One More Time - The song that started it all. Still Britneys best and most respected song. It showed the world what a sexy star can bring to the table with pure attitude and yearning. 11/10 <br />9. Crazy - The Stop remix is much stronger than the original version and its great that this is the version on the album. A great pop song. 10/10 <br />10. Boys - Another song in its superior remixed version. Its sexy but doesnt really stand strong among these other huge hits. 9/10 <br />11. Sometimes - One of her sweetest pop songs that oozed innocense and young love. A great song. 10/10 <br />12. Overprotected - Another in its remix version. But like \\"boys\\" it seems weak surrounded by such big hits.9/10 <br />13. Lucky - Not one of Britneys best, but it is catchy. I enver understood why it was such a big hit. 9/10 <br />14. Outrageous - This is the one song that I dont think deserved to be on this album at all. its a great song but it isnt her best or even a hit. 9/10 <br />15. I'm Not A Girl Not Yet Woman - Britneys song about her identity. A great Britney Ballad and it hold strong on this album. One Of Brits best. 10/10 <br />16. I'v Just Begun Having My Fun - A very fun and sexy. Its crazy and along the lines of Toxic and Do Something. 9/10 <br />17. Do Something - Really fun and energetic. a great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />The other disc has remixes and more importantly a medly of britneys hits that is lots of fun to listen to. The everytime remix and the outrageous remix are brilliant also. <br /> <br />The album is missing Britneys slower ballads like \\"Don't Let Me  Be The Last to Know\\" which really deserved its spot on this album cuz its one of her best. \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" also deserved its spot its Britneys best vocally and its powerful. \\"Born to Make You Happy\\" could have been here. <br /> <br />This is an essential cd for anyone who even slightly likes pop music. Every song is good and you should own it.
B000002U8G|5.0|For many fans, \\"Meddle\\" marks a starting point for a long list of CLASSIC, LEGENDARY Pink Floyd albums that will probably never be topped by any other band of this \\"Progressive Rock\\" style of music. This incredible album also marks the beginning of the REAL Pink Floyd that most people recognize. From \\"Piper\\" to \\"Atom\\", the group has grown, changed directions, and expanded their horizons, but were still nonetheless trying to find their \\"niche\\" in the music world. With their 6th album \\"Meddle\\", they have indeed found their \\"niche\\", in my opinion. Starting where the last impressive album \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" left off, \\"Meddle\\" plunges you into \\"One Of These Days\\", an intense instrumental with a demented message towards the end, and the next two songs showcase a real focused, mature sounding Floyd. Tracks four and five are the only questionable songs on the album, but considering the masterpiece that comes next, it's very forgivable. \\"Echoes\\" is the beginning of the Pink Floyd we all know and love. Taking up the rest of the album, it is quite the musical experience that will leave you hungry for more, and proves to be an extremely impressive piece of work that has withstood the test of time. All in all, \\"Meddle\\" is a very good album and is considered by many to be the BEST of the pre-\\"Dark Side\\" albums.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|No rapping this time. And I love it. <br /> <br />\\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" is great. <br /> <br />Don't buy this if you are too critical of Madonna, because this time, she is just having fun.  <br /> <br />There are a few of you out there who are bound to hate this CD, just to be difficult. Don't.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd's 8th album: \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". NEED I SAY MORE??? Honestly, what can I say that hasn't been said before of one of THE GREATEST albums of our time?? Before getting into Pink Floyd, I heard all the hype about \\"Dark Side\\", but didn't believe it. Then one day I got it and gave it a try. I'll admit that at first, I didn't get it. Then I gave it a couple more listens and realized why I didn't get it at first- because I was knocked off my feet from this UNBELIEVABLE MASTERPIECE!! Yes, all that you hear about this album is true, and there was never an album like it before OR after it's release in '73. It's the album that put the Floyd in the lime-light all across the world, and for years to come. Think it's over-rated? Maybe so, but after hearing it you'll KNOW WHY! From David Gilmour's masterful guitar playing to Roger Water's direction and lyrical content, and from Rick Wright and Nick Mason's input, you hear a HUGE effort from the group as a WHOLE. It's pure genius and beauty of how all the songs and instrumentals are constructed and placed together to form a non-stop, continuous flow of top-notch, legendary Pink Floyd that will take you on a journey you'll NEVER forget. From \\"Dark Side\\" to \\"Division Bell\\", you are in for one heck of a ride, but I STILL rate \\"Dark Side\\" as my #1 favorite, and definitely the place to start. And that is HARD to do, considering all their next albums are utter masterpieces in their own right. I recommend it to any new-comer and anybody who's wanting to open their mind and experience a whole new world of beauty and perfection in the vast universe of music. \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" is an audible picture of perfection, and will NEVER be topped by ANYONE in the progressive rock world, and SOME may say, by anyone in the ENTIRE WORLD of music!! GIVE IT A SHOT- you will remember and cherish this album FOREVER.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Occasionally the reviews of an album really do capture exactly what an album is about. One review went into detail on how this album managed to be retro, yet pushing the boudaries of dance forward at the same, consequently giving the whole retro thing, so popular right now, a whole new spin. I thought that sounded a bit arty farty at the time, but, well, it was actually spot on! <br /> <br />You can hear the influences on this album, sometimes from her own back catalogue, but what you get is something different each time. The music itself is very evocative and the lyrics less self-obsessed than her last outing. \\"Jump\\" is a great song, absoluely irresistably danceable and life-affirming, should definitely be her next single. \\"Push\\" conjures up images of working elephants pushing fallen logs in some distant jungle as their masters break out in Far Eastern robotic dance moves (sounds crazy, but listen to that song and see!); whilst \\"forbidden love\\" once again uses a vocoder(\\"Nobodys perfect\\") to absolutely sumptuous effect. <br /> <br />I don't know how she does it, but she has done it again. Everytime, the critics try to write her off, she comes back with a bang. <br /> <br />May the lesson be learnt now after 25 years of selling 250 million albums and over a 100 million singles (and yes according to Guiness she is the world's biggest selling female artist - not Mariah), never write Madonna off - she will only push back, fighting harder with renewed passion. And the passion is definitely here on this album - it cannot be denied!  <br />
B000002U9W|4.0|Pink Floyd's 5th album is a real interesting piece of work that may take a few listens to fully appreciate, but once you get it, you get it. Unlike their previous flop \\"Ummagumma\\", this one really began growing on me after a few listens. Except for the last track, \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", this album actually has listenable music, and GOOD listenable music at that. The first and longest track \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", is a very long, addictive instrumental that sets the over-all mood of the album, and is in the same vein as \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" in some ways. But unlike SoS, it employs a very impressive orchestra. At first, you may get bored with it, wondering what the point is, but as with alot of Pink Floyd's Pre-Dark Side material, it takes a few listens to really appreciate. But in my opinion it's a very rewarding musical experience. The next 3 songs, shorter and not instrumentals, are really good and are in my opinion right up there with the best Pre-Dark Side material Pink Floyd has to offer. The last, \\"Alan's\\" mentioned above, is a little on the bizarre side and consists mainly of noises taking place in a kitchen. A little harder to get into, and I think the album could've gone without it. But considering the first 4 tracks are incredible , \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is one of Pink Floyd's first classics. Ironically, the band themselves don't care much for this album. Cover designer Storm Thurgeson has called his \\"Cow\\" cover one of his favorite creations, and it is a very simple but unique cover, for a very complex and unique album.
038533348X|5.0|With the exception perhaps of Douglas Adams, who else can make the end of the world so entertaining.  This is an exceptional book from Vonnegut and I strongly recommed it.

B000002UA2|5.0|Pink Floyd's 7th album, \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", is actually the band's 2nd soundtrack to a '72 film entitled \\"La Vallee\\", directed by the same guy who did \\"More\\". Between the two soundtracks, this one is by far better. Despite having the absolute WORST PF album cover, this album is not to be judged by it. It remains a very solid effort, and to this day, it is a pleasure to listen to. Beautiful instrumentals and powerful songs with that classic Pink Floyd sound. It over all seems a tad more developed than \\"Meddle\\", however more rushed, but don't get me wrong- that album is just as good in it's own way as well. This is the one that bridges that classic album \\"Meddle\\" to the unbelievable \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". This album fits in well, sandwiched inbetween, because though a bit different (it being a soundtrack), it is done with the utmost Pink Floyd quality that you come to expect. Some may say it's not as good as \\"Meddle\\", but I personally think it's right there on the same level. I consider it to be one of Pink Floyd's \\"lost gems\\" and I think it is vastly underrated. Give it a try- you might be surprised.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Well I've waited awhile to write this review since I bought the DVD the day it came out. I was also fortunate to attend the October 25th show at MSG. Considering that I also saw Robert Plant and Paul McCartney, well Cream was my show of the year!That said, listen up...buy this now if you want some outstanding music and musicianship!<br /><br />The fact that they came together at all is almost a miracle. The problems of the past seem to be where they should be, the past. (Are you listening David Gilmour and Roger Waters!) Jack's voice is superb throughout. Eric's solo's were different every night and he played extremely well. And then there's Ginger. How many drummers a third of his age can play as well? None that I can think of. In fact, I don't know of one even half his age that plays as well.<br /><br />Are there some disappointments? Sure there are. Most of us would have liked to have live versions of SWLABR, I Feel Free, and Strange Brew. But let's not bicker over trivial stuff and be thankful for what we got. BTW, I said I saw them at MSG, well they did play Tales of Brave Ulysses and there was a recording truck outside...hmmmm.
B000002UA5|2.0|Now this is the ONE Pink Floyd album I have a real hard time getting into. Not surprisingly, it's one of the bands most unpopular albums, with most fans not knowing what to make of it. While the \\"Live\\" half features GREAT live performances of 3 classics from their first 2 albums and one really interesting b-side, \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\", the \\"Studio\\" half is extremely bizarre and is barely listenable at best. It contains instrumental pieces from Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason. Some Lyrical content, but not much. Mostly a lot of really wierd noise making that makes me wonder if it's really even music. I think the band's goal here was to make the most bizarre record possible, to be \\"out-wierded\\" by nobody else. Well, in my opinion, I think they reached their goal with this one.
B0000028UK|5.0|With Vs. Pearl Jam showed they were beginning to change. They still had the intense, hard hitting songs like they had on Ten, but they also began to experiment. Good cases in both situations. And with this experimentation came some of the best music rock has ever seen. This is, hands down, the best album I've heard in years. Incubus is my favorite band and I'd put this CD before any of theirs. While this CD doesn't have as many hits as Ten did, the songs are of a much higher standard here. Glorified G and W.M.A. are proof of growth and quality. Disident, one of PJ's best songs is much better than half of the songs Ten had to offer. I think Ten was PJ's worst album simply because it sounded rushed and the sound quality wasn't particularly good. But I will say that it showed potential that the band actually did grasp in the long run. So here we are with one of the best Sophomore albums of all time.<br /><br />Go starts out this CD briskly and effectively, much like Yield's Brain Of J. This song should also display right away that Ed's voice is at a new high and the band has aged to perfection. Animal is a nice follow-up to Go. Along with Leash, this is one of the most intense songs featured, and whether Pearl Jam is playing heavy or light, it's going to turn out good. Daughter slows the CD down enough to remind you that they do have range, that they can play a beautiful slower song. Glorified G is so upbeat and catchy that you'd never think it was about guns. It's a pretty political song, especially in the first verse, but PJ did political before it was a bad thing and they're the only band that continues to do it tastefully. Dissident is one of those songs where you remember the exact place you were and what you were doing when you first heard it, such as Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven does to people of the 70's. W.M.A. is the first apparent experimental track they do on this CD and it's one of the best songs on here. The lyrics are wonderful in all their controversial glory and the band does an extraordinary job as a whole. Blood is the only average track on here in my opinion. I like it, but it seems like any other band could do the same song and the only thing that would set the two apart is Ed's stellar voice. Rearviewmirror is a nice bounceback song though. This will probably become an anthem to any abused teen who hears it. And that's not a bad thing because the lyrics are so touching and you really end up feeling the pain in Ed's voice. Rats, while people don't seem particularly fond of it, is a good song. The verses are a little lacking but the chorus is a nice make-up. Elderly Woman... does the same thing that Daughter does, it slows the CD down to remind you that you're not listening to any normal band. But where this song differs from Daughter is that it's completely acoustic accompanied only by drums. Leash is just a good rock song. Even with this CD being over 10 years old, this song still feels as if it would take any rock song on the radio nowadays and just blow it away, which it does. And finally we have Indifference. I loved Ten's closer Release and this is one of the only closing songs by PJ that can honestly contend with it. The guitar is downplayed a little to give it a little bit more emotional feel which, in turn, puts Ed's voice and lyrics proudly on display. Just the perfect way to close out a CD of this calibur.<br /><br />My favorite songs on here are Glorified G, Dissident, W.M.A., Rearviewmirror, and Indifference. This is not a CD that should be looked over. Although Ten does get more attention most of the time, this is by far PJ's shining moment in their career. I love all of their releases but song for song, this is the most consistent they've put out. Having said that, if I had to make a top 10 list of the best CDs put out in the 90's, this would no doubt take the cake.versial glory and the band does an extraordinary job as a whole.

B000002U9Y|5.0|In my opinion, Pink Floyd's 2nd album is the best of their real early work. It's the first album not COMPLETELY dominated by Syd Barret, and the first album with the soon-to-be guitar legend, David Gilmour. Sadly, Syd took a turn for the worst in the mental health department due to drug use and wrote only 1 of the 7 songs on Saucer, titled \\"Jugband Blues\\", and the lyrics clearly talk about Syd's situation. Gilmour steps in and the group take a slightly new and different direction from that of \\"Piper\\". And it is a direction that they would soon master in utmost perfection. The over-all mood of the album is hard to describe- some songs are ultimate \\"space-rock\\", some are real moody and dark, while others take a slightly humorous angle. \\"Corporal Clegg\\" is really the only song that may slightly turn you off due to a real silly-sounding instrument, but keep in mind that the Floyd were just beginning to discover themselves and the sounds they were capable of. Don't be fooled by only 7 songs indicating a short album, because \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" is actually a really long instrumental that takes you to psychedelic places, and is the groups first really \\"long\\" instrumental. Pink Floyd would create interesting instrumentals for the rest of their career. Over-all, this album is really good and is a good indication of where they were at in the early days and of the style they would soon master.
B000AL730O|2.0|Far be it from mortal me to attempt to knock a legend off his pedestal, but, sick of hearing, every few years when Sir Paul releases a new album that it's `his comeback!'  `He hasn't been this good in years!!'  `The best since the 70s!!!'  Please, Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame solo be damned, he's never released a masterpiece [closest was his almost-covers CD post-Linda, a fine tribute to 50s nostalgia].  While not as lethargic as `Driver Rain', or cringe-inducing as his last live opus, this is still a major annoyance. He was balanced by John, George and Ringo in the 60s, unbalanced by Linda and - who else? - ever since.  My grade: B-
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is back, LIKE IT OR NOT, get ready to JUMP, because she's produced a corker with Stuart Price. Buy it, you will not be SORRY.
B000002UAO|5.0|Once upon a time, there was a group of four people from London, who thought it would be a great idea to start a band. They travelled to and fro, trying to learn the different chords to play. Then one day, they were shipped away to play in Germany, where they got better and better. As soon as they came back from Germany, they had become sensations in their own Liverpool. They went on to conquer London, then England, and then Europe. Until one day, they released a song called \\"She Loves You\\", which hit American airwaves. The song introduced the Beatles, as they liked to call themselves, to the United State folks, who loved them. Hits soon followed. Hit after hit, the Beatles soared in popularity, while they're fans couldn't get enough of their personalities. Their tunes went gold, then platnum, all the while breaking more records than anyone in the past.  <br /> <br />However, soon, they got bored. And so they stopped touring. They locked themselves in a studio and produced music so good, it couldn't have been from humans. Yet the Beatles made that music, in their little studio on Abbey Road, and released the first taste of it, in an album called \\"Rubber Soul\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Soul\\" was both outragous and sharp, dumb yet intelligent, a joke and a masterpiece in music. It was an album so full of ingenious wit that when you listened to it, you would be wondering why it wasn't burting at the seams.  <br /> <br />It was an album that mirrored art, so you would be wondering why this wasn't up on a wall somewhere.  <br /> <br />If the Beatles hadn't done it, then it would be impossible to invent such a story.  <br /> <br />The End
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Although not as funny as \\"South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut,\\"  this is an entertaining spoof of action movies, with pointed jabs at both the jingoistic Right and the clueless, self-important Hollywood Left.  Production is quite elaborate for a puppet movie, with elaborate sets and lots of explosions. Definitely worth watching if you won't get offended by LOTS of bad language, fairly graphic puppet sex, and some equally graphic violence.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|HUNG UP - We're all familiar with this hit, but hearing it on the car stereo on the way home was like hearing the song for the first time. The audio quality, depth, and beat were so incredible. The song is all over the radio right now, but really the album version is the only way to hear it. Definitely one of my fave tracks from the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />GET TOGETHER - I just love the daft punk sound of this song, this should be a single. It really grows on you the more you listen. The driving bassline is brilliant, I love the segue from HUNG UP to this track, with a ringing alarm clock. In fact I've found it quite interesting how the songs connect to each other. Perhaps the line in GET TOGETHER \\"If it's bitter at the start, then it's sweeter in the end\\" should actually be \\"If it's brilliant at the start, then it's sweeter at the end.\\" Great start to the album. 9/10 <br /> <br />SORRY - As we know this is single #2, and deservedly so. I was already familiar with this one, but once again the actual CD quality is significantly better on the ears. M sounds somewhat akward when saying sorry in the asian languages midway through, but it's still a treat. The beat of the chorus reminds me of \\"Causing a Commotion\\" for some reason (\\"I've heard it all before\\"?) This track's a real \\"in your face f*cker\\" type of song, but with a true pop edge that only Madonna could pull off. 10/10 <br /> <br />FUTURE LOVERS - The only Mirwais-produced track on the album, but it flows with the other songs very well. I love the spoken word at the beginning, and the infectiously repetitive \\"In the evidence of it's brilliance.\\" A very futuristic sounding song, despite the Donna Summer sampling. I could see this being a MASSIVE club hit. \\"There's no love like the future, love\\" hehe! 9/10 <br /> <br />I LOVE NY - A tourism jingle in the making? I think this is the most suprising song for me, I didn't have high expectations given the song title. The line \\"other places make me feel like a dork\\" has already been panned by some critics, but they can 'F' Off! This is the rockiest track on the album, but still fits with the \\"dance\\" theme. Love the line \\"Get off of my street\\" and the Texas/Golf dig at George W. Part of the mix sounds like some previous M remixes I've heard, which I love. Sirens to end, very NYC! 9/10 <br /> <br />LET IT WILL BE - The title still confuses me, if someone can explain it to be that'd be nice, ha! Interesting that this song about the rise-and-fall of fame follows NY, which is where she initially became famous afterall. The strings are reminiscent of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Die Another Day.\\" Love the part where she sings \\"Now watch me burn.\\" 8/10 <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE - Interesting sound at the beginning, somewhat ambiguous but nonetheless intriguing. The vocoder computerized vocals on this track are brilliant. A rave-worthy love song, the song really kicks halfway through. The chorus is surprisingly heartfelt, which is unusual for a techno track. Miles different from Madonna's other track called Forbidden Love. The segue into JUMP is the best IMO. 9/10 <br /> <br />JUMP - My fave track on the album! A surefire hit. Love the line \\"my sistas and me...\\" My dad asked me if this was Madonna covering the Pointer Sisters song \\"Jump.\\" I just laughed and shook my head. \\"Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump, Don't ever look back, oh baby.\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />HOW HIGH - Thumping beat, heavy on the vocoder but it works. Doesn't sound much like Britney's \\"Toxic\\" despite the same producers. 8/10 <br /> <br />ISAAC - The beginning sounded like it was from Evita, haha! But not once the arabic singer starts his chanting. Lyrically this one could have been off the RAY OF LIGHT album, especially with the Frozen-worthy mmmm-mmm-ing. This song is intoxicating though, the hebrew singer blends well with M's own words. It bothers me that people are simply labelling this Madonna's \\"Kabbalah\\" song. Simple minds. 9/10 <br /> <br />PUSH - Is this written for Mr. Ritchie? Sure sounds like it. The chorus is great, really uplifting. But the verses seem too rushed and frenetic to me. Not sure I like the production on this one either. If you listen closely you can hear a sample from \\"Like a Prayer,\\" although it's hard to tell. 8/10 <br /> <br />LIKE IT OR NOT - Perhaps a fitting way to end the album, almost a message to her many nay-sayers. Comparing herself to Cleopatra and Mata Hari is a bit much, and the business with the snake is odd. The chorus almost sounds like finger-snapping blues to me, haha! Notice a (likely unintentional) Kylie reference with the line \\"Better the Devil that you know.\\" This track sounds like it belongs on the Erotica album, given the similarities to FEVER. 8/10 <br /> <br />Overall it's a brilliant album (9/10), very different from American Life and Music. Lyrically simplistic and less messages than in the past, but the overall consistentcy from track to track serves the album well. The songs sound almost pre-remixed, and they flow very well. You can put this CD on at a party and let it play all the way through, each track is a treasure in it's own right. A sticker on the packaging reads: 'A non-stop, all-dance tour de force!' Well put. Madonna has suceeded in making an album that's mainstream-friendly without being mainstream (by today's standards) at all. <br />
B000002MIB|3.0|Van Halen's one and only live album,\\"Live:Right Here,Right Now\\" is pretty good,but it is what some people will often refer to as \\"a mixed bag\\".     As mentioned above,this is one of the best sounding live albums out there,and even though the tracklisting could have been better,this is still decent. It is a collection of Van Halen songs recorded live in about a four or five year time span from when Sammy Hagar was the lead singer of VH,and here,you hear Van Halen perfroming nine out of the eleven songs from Knowledge,as well as four songs from the Roth era of Van Halen(\\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\",\\"Panama\\",and half of both \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"Eruption\\"),two of Sammy Hagar's solo songs(\\"There's Only One Way to Rock\\" and \\"Give to Live\\"),four songs from their \\"5150\\" album(\\"Dreams\\",\\"Love Walks In\\",\\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\",and \\"Best of Both Worlds\\"),three songs from the Van Halen(Hagar era)album \\"OU812\\"(\\"When It's Love\\",\\"Finish What Ya Started\\",and half of \\"Cabo Wabo\\"),along with a pretty good cover version of The Who classic \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". Like another reviewer already mentioned,the sound and quality of this live album is so good that it is like a party on a CD,and Michael Anthony's bass solo,Alex Van Halen's drum solo,and Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo(which starts off as the instrumental \\"316\\" leading into \\"Eruption\\")are all really good and solid,but the problem is the tracklisting. It isn't incredibly bad,but it is missing songs like \\"I Can't Drive 55\\"(I know that that is one of Sammy Hagar's solo songs,but if Sammy and everyone else in VH were going to play some of Sammy's solo material live,what was wrong with the idea of including a live performance of Sammy's most popular and most famous solo song on here????!!!!),there should have been a couple of more songs from the Roth era here(probably both \\"Dance The Night Away\\" and \\"Unchained\\"),and I think including live performances of \\"Black and Blue\\" and \\"Mine All Mine\\" from \\"0U812\\" would have been really cool also and would have helped this live album be better than it turned out(I don't mind the large amount of songs from For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge being here,with the exception of \\"Man On A Mission\\"). But everything else here is really good,while this is a fun live album to listen to--Sammy,Eddie,Alex,and Mike all do a great job at contributing to that. The booklet accompanying this live album,which has pictures of Van Halen from their tour on which this live record was recorded,is really cool and is a good supplement to this CD.    Bottom Line:buy this live album ONLY if you are a die hard Van Halen fan,like both the Roth and Hagar eras of Van Halen,and don't mind the tracklisting here.

B0006IIKS0|4.0|I've seen a lot of interesting music documentaries before,and I must say, Metallica's \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" documentary is one of them. This is both a documentary and a movie,and while I would have liked this more if it was just a documentary,this is still very good,interesting,and something all fans and non fans of Metallica will enjoy.    Here,you learn the story of Metallica--one of heavy metal's finest bands. It mostly discusses the making of the Metallica album \\"St. Anger\\" and shows all of the harsh blood that was going on in and around Metallica at the time the album was being made. At times in this film,you will see Metallica band members James Hetfield,Kirk Hammett,Lars Ulrich,and Rob Trujilo making \\"St. Anger\\" in a studio with producer Bob Rock,and the documentary does a good job at documenting the problems that were going on in Metallica around the making of that album--I won't give any of that away so things can stay interesting for you when you watch this documentary for the first time,but half of the problems that were filmed and documented here will keep you in front of your TV--that is how good this documentary is. If you like being up close and personal with a band you like by watching them from your TV,this film is guaranteed to satisfy.    This documentary also does a good job at following the career of Metallica. There are some pictures of the guys in Metallica when they were teenagers(not too long before they started Metallica,I might add),they show good footage of news about Cliff Burton dying in that one bus accident he was in(there is even a clip of Dana Strum,the bassist for a band ex-KISS guitarist Vinnie Vincent formed and the 80's/90's hair metal group Slaughter who had the hit song \\"Up All Night(Sleep All Day)\\",talking about Burton's death on VH1 after it happened--very intesting,rare,and something that people who like Metallica,KISS,and 80's hair metal will enjoy having here),and the info/footage about the whole Metallica/Napster controversy is quite interesting(one part of this documentary even shows a clip of a cartoon that was poking fun at Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield for that whole case)and very detailed. Before you watch this documentary,don't expect to know Metallica's entire career from top to bottom,but expect to learn about their rise and fall and some of the problems that have affected the lives of the guys in Metallica. The part I found really interesting was when James Hetfield was shown in a recording studio,recording music,and I liked it how he submitted his voice for that part of the documentary to say how his rough childhood lead him to not trusting anyone. The guys in Metallica have a lot of interesting things to say here.    There are some pretty cool bonus feautures on this DVD,some of which include 40 additional unreleased scenes for this film,interviews with Metallica about this film,clips from festivals and premieres for this film,2 audio commentaries from both Metallica and the people that made this film,as well as 2 trailers and a music video. If you like Metallica,this DVD is a must have--I am very pleased to own this DVD,and hopefully a documentary/DVD on both the new line-up of Guns 'n Roses and the long awaited \\"Chinese Democracy\\" album will also see the light of day.
0385510454|4.0|The title says most of it.  I haven't read (or heard an audio book) from John Grisham that I didn't like.  They all hold their own in character and this one is no different.  The wit, drama and sometimes comedy in this book is beautifully done.<br /><br />I hope, if it DOES become a movie, that the script is done as well as the book.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Put this CD in your Player, and bring your best Dancing Shoes with you! This album is a corker!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is easily the best Madonna album since Ray of Light.  The songs are all great dance tracks and flow really well together.  Yes, maybe the lyrics to I Love New York are a little silly but it is meant to be a light-hearted song and the lyrics to Music and Impressive Instant were a little silly but that didn't stop those songs from becoming hits.  I have been listening to this cd non-stop since Tuesday and it is great.  I keep finding something new to love about it.  Great dance tracks with touches of techno, house, classic disco references, 80's style electro-clash and even a funky track (Push) that has an urban feel to it.  If you like dance music you will love this cd.   Don't listen to these annoying people who keep posting one star reviews on here.  They are the same Mariah Carey fans who are just pissed off because Madonna is getting good reviews, her cd is selling well, her single is higher on the charts than Mariah's Don't Forget About Us, and is number one on MTV's TRL and number one on I-Tunes singles and album sales.   Go to MTV's the leak and listen for yourself.  If you have a pulse you will find something on here that will make you wanna dance.  My favorites are Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry, Jump, How High, Forbidden Love, Like It or Not, Isaac, heck I like everything!!
B000089HCR|4.0|W.A.S.P. was formed in the late 70s by Blackie Lawless who had been in the New York Dolls (post Johnny Thunders) and London with Nikki Six. Their first single Animal (F*ck Like A Beast) was produced by guitar connoisseur Mike Varney. It was refused release due to the title, but it is included on this re-issue! I have good memories of getting this on cassette by skipping church (sinner!) and going to my favorite music store. I think I bought it along with Grim Reaper's debut. Anyways, about half of this album is classic metal. My favorite songs are I Wanna Be Somebody (great chorus!), L.O.V.E. Machine (cool drums by Tony Richards), The Flame (good time rocker), School Daze (amusing lyrics), and Sleeping In The Fire (haunting ballad w/ great solo by Chris Holmes). This re-issue also includes a good cover of the Stones Paint It Black, making it a great bargain. Get it and crank it!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The people who keep coming and posting the negative reviews and cra- here are from the organization called the TEAM L.A.M.B. They seem to me that they don't know what they are doing and are more importantly mentally sick!!! <br />So ignore these people's cra- and save your time by not reading it!! <br />Below is the post that they have on their website! <br />read it, people, and you will know that they are crazy and sick!! <br />of course they don't want to admit that MADONNA IS STILL THE QUEEN OF POP.  <br /> <br /> <br />Welcome to TeamLamb, an organized team of Mariah Carey fans. Our purpose is to keep Mariah, the biggest female musical icon of all time, on top.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the no-talent ****, Madonna, is still being referred to as the \\"Queen of Pop,\\" even though her most recent album, American Life, and her Reinvention Tour have really made her the \\"Queen of Flops.\\" Madonna used to be successful, but that's because she slept her way to the top. Mariah, on the other hand, has sold millions of records based solely on her amazing talents and being a great role model.  <br /> <br />Mariah has had sixteen number one singles. Her last two number one singles, \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" have broken worldwide records everywhere. Mariah's most recent Charmbracelet tour was a critically acclaimed smash that played to millions all over the world. Roger Friedman, a well respected music journalist, called the concert one of the greatest he's seen in the past ten years. Mariah is, indeed, the biggest musical sensation since the Beatles.  <br /> <br />Within the next couple months, Madonna will try to take away Mariah's crown by releasing \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" along with the single, \\"Hung Up.\\" There seems to be a lot of buzz , but most of it seems generated by Madonna's desperate, pathetic fans. TeamLamb will do everything we can to make this project a flop for Madonna. We will organize by calling radio stations and telling them how muchwe don't like her new songs, write letters to several magazines and confirm that she is, indeed, over, and spread negative messages about Madonna on several Internet blogs. <br />
B000000OAN|4.0|I didn't get into Queen until around 1981 when I got their first (of many) Greatest Hits on vinyl. That album included two Queen classics from A Night At The Opera: the feel good You're My Best Friend and the complex classic Bohemian Rhapsody. It was only a matter of time until I would get most of Queen's albums. This album was Queen's fourth, produced by Roy Thomas Baker and released in 1975. My favorite songs are Death On Two Legs (great guitar), Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon (short and sweet), I'm In Love With My Car (great vocals by drummer Taylor), '39, Seaside Rendezvous (classic Freddie), and the two I mentioned before. With one of the greatest vocalists of all time and a melodic guitarist with a unique tone, Queen could do no wrong. I put this album between the excellent Innuendo and one of my personal favorites, A Kind Of Magic.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|Disclaimer:  I've never cared for this story.  The characters are too inactive in it.  They just wander around from strange scene to strange scene, slowly being picked off, until Charlie remains and then THE END.  Kind of like a slasher film without the charm of a low budget and a guy in a hockey mask. <br /> <br />This version isn't terrible, but it's meandering.  Worse, it isn't nearly as colorful or imaginative as it's supposed to be.  I'm not saying there isn't some cool stuff in it, but a lot of it is stuff I saw in the original film.  There's really not much new to it except for the special effects, which are admittedly very good. <br /> <br />But it always comes back to the story, and I just didn't care about it.  It doesn't help that I already knew it, knew everything that was going to happen.  It's hard to be awed by things you expect.  And the bit about Willy Wonka finding a family seemed labored and unnecessary to me. <br /> <br />And about the Oompha Loomphas, two points:  They're kind of creepy in this version. Creepier even than the original if that's possible.  And I couldn't understand a word of their songs.  Very irritating. <br /> <br />One positive note:  The Puppet Burn Center made me laugh and laugh and laugh for about ten minutes.  So I can't be too hard on the film in the end.  Still, not my bag.
B000089CJI|5.0|This CD is so very special to me. I bought it a year ago by recommendation from a friend which happened during an important event in my life. I was sort of in a distraught and sad mood and not feeling well right in the middle of me hanging out with him. It was winter and some things in my life were happening that made me feel terrible (nothing BAD, but bad in the sense of things that make you sad, if that makes sense). He could tell I was feeling sick and played \\"Such Great Heights\\" for me. It's almost like a dream to me now how beautiful and relieving it was to me at the time. I bought \\"Give Up\\" that very night and still love it to this day!  <br />This CD captures the wonderful emotional quality that Death Cab For Cutie (another important band to me, one of my favorites!) portrays in their albums. Dntl is very cool I think and the combo of him and Ben Gibbard was so complimenting to eachother it's amazing. Emotional melody and beats are constant and it's as if the CD was made with perfect unison between the members even though they live hundreds of miles away! Amazing musicship. For what it's worth, this CD is very special to me and I'm taken to a feeling of happiness and worth everytime I play this ablum. The Postal Service is wonderful and I'm sure you can find some place in your life special to plug this CD in as your life's soundtrack at times. <br />Peace, <br />Ty
0553801503|3.0|having followed the progress of this book from the onset i understood grrm's original intent (the infamous five-year jump), to the realization that some loose ends needed tying (the death of the viper), and then the need to split the novel in two. and while i understand the reasoning behind grrm's decisions, having read the finished product, i simply disagree with his decision. <br /> <br />this is not to say the novel was in and of itself uninteresting or necessarily unnecessary. it was nice to see dorne's reaction and the fate of a number of tertiary characters - but not at the expense of the overall story. grrm has demonstrated an excellent balance and subtlety between the primary story and the subplots in his previous three books, yet i feel the latter receives too much emphasis in this installment at the expense of the former.  <br /> <br />to draw an example: in the previous books sam was a minor character who was granted his own pov and we learned many interesting details that even breathed life into randyll tarly who would otherwise have been a very wooden, very minor character - yet all the while serving as a vehicle to propel the main story of the wall further forward. <br />compared now to feast: we are introduced to brienne who was a minor yet intriguing character who is now granted a pov. through her we learn the fates of many a characters including the hound, rorge&biter, and gendry - but doesn't add momentum to the overall story. <br /> <br />and this is rather representative of the book as a whole. but that isn't to say that this is the beginning of the end. it's quite possible that grrm has a plan to bring it all back together (i'm postulating in the 6th, not the 5th book) in truly spectacular fashion, but i still feel the series would have been better served with some sacrafices. <br /> <br />as a final p.s. i wouldn't worry too much about it turning into another wheel of time. although the pacing has definitely slowed down, it's not branching outlike the sprawling monstrosity with millions of unanswered questions that the wheel of time became.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This is a wildy visual and funny ride from Tim Burton.  I love Burton films and I love Depp, so I may be just a tad predjudiced, but I had a smile on my face from begining to end.  Depp's Wonka is innocent bordering on malevolent.  He had me in hysterics.  Burton's best work wonders with sets and effects providing a visually beautiful and magical world.  You can still like the original, but it's okay to appreciate this vivid retelling too.
B0006399FS|1.0|I can't stand U2.  I despise them immensely.  Boner (oops, I meant Bono) thinks he's so hip and righteous.  I can't stand those huge glasses he wears, either.  He needs to fire his stylist and quick!  As for this CD, it blows.  How it went multiplatinum is a mystery.  \\"Vertigo\\" is aptly named because it made me dizzy and sick after listening to it.  The album goes downhill from there.  Get Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" instead.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I know many people don't like this film and consider it a waste of time. They think it's another Hollywood gibberish with a shallow story-line. And I think I may understand those people - the story itself isn't new, time-travel movies is a topic you can't get nothing new out of, there are some plot holes (show me a movie with no plot holes). But on the other hand \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" stands out among all other similar films. It's solid and well-made. It's intense and sometimes dismal. It's professionally shot and it's stylish. You may say whatever you want after the final credits, but I think you'll agree with me that watching was fun. It was interesting. When you can't take your eyes off the screen and wonder what turn the narration will take the other minute - it means you're watching an entertaining movie. And we can't take the fact it is really entertaining and cunning away from this film. It is gripping indeed.<br /><br />The most fascinating thing about the edition itself is that it has (besides the whole amount of bonus-features) 3 alternative endings. Two of them are variations to the theatrical cut and one is a totally different ending primarily intended by creators of the film. And as I think it is way better than the final one. The problem is it was not welcomed by the audience at test-screenings (which happens rather often). So it may be really interesting for you to check it out yourself.
0780622650|2.0|LOST IN SPACE's main distinction is that it is the movie that knocked TITANIC out of the top spot after 17 weeks at number one.  Other than that, this abysmal reworking of the campy tv series boasts little more than some pretty impressive special fx.  But, special fx do not a good movie make.  This one's a misfire with hokey plotting, below par acting, and an ending that spelled SEQUEL, which of course never happened since the movie pretty much bombed.  But you may enjoy the spider special effects including Gary Oldman's transition; the little monkey creature from the Jim Henson workshop and some interesting spatial images.  In bringing the Robinsons into the nineties, the writers eschewed the picture perfect sixties Robinsons by giving them the usual marital and childhood angsts including the father who is never home and the teenage girl aching to be a grownup.  William Hurt and Mimi Rogers aren't as vapid as Guy Williams and June Lockhart, but they're not very interesting either.  Matt LeBlanc's character is so obnoxious it makes one pine for the less egotistical Mark Goddard and munchkin like Lacey Chabert will never make us forget Angela Cartwright.  And of course Jack Johnson is no sub for Billy Mumy and as for Oldman's Dr. Smith---let's just say Jonathan Harris never had anything to worry about.  A senseless effort to recapture an age gone by.
B000A5044C|4.0|This is a great film and an extremely important one as well.  Amazingly, it is brought to life through a screenplay acted out primarily by children, with relatively little dialogue.  After about the first quarter of the film, the absence of the mother brings the dialogue to a near halt.  Occasionally it is punctuated by the babblings of the smaller children however Akira and Kyoko, the two older children, exist in relative silence.  Interactions amongst store clerks and others are limited to mechanical discourse of mere formality.  Never do we hear what Akira is feeling.  Hence, the viewer is forced to watch and attempt to understand what is going on in each child's mind.  In a sense, viewing this movie is an exercise in child psychology.<br /><br />With their mother absent, their living conditions degenerate.  Although the younger children seem oblivious to their squalid living conditions, the senses of Akira and his sister Kyoko seem to further dull with each passing day.  They show relatively no emotion.  At one point Akira seeks to obtain some money from his younger sister's father.  They meet behind a pachinko hall where he works.  He gives him 5000 yen and then tells young Akira that even though he is giving him money, Yuki (Akira's sister) couldn't possibly be his daughter because he never had unprotected sex with his mother.  The discussion of one's mother's sexual promiscuity would seemingly be traumatic to a young child, but the fact that this statement doesn't seem to faze him, reveals how deep his emotions are set inside.<br /><br />During the whole movie there are numerous signals that one would think neighbors would see.  The landlord's wife seems to be somewhat aware of their situation but does not investigate.  Even a convenience store clerk, who is fully abreast of their dire condition, does nothing.  The fact that in a developed nation and in an urban environment, this story could be played out leads one to question the safeguards established within our own communities and cities.<br /><br />Although watching Nobody Knows is painful, a careful viewing will allow you take in all that it has to offer.  Along with its excellent visual presentation, its simple music complements the acting.  Some might feel that the movie is a little on the long side, to which I would agree.  Some scenes seemed a little tangential and non-critical to an understanding of the children, but I would not categorize them as completely superfluous.  It is definitely a film worth your time, but perhaps not the $20 for the DVD if you get easily bored.  If nothing else, watch it to find out the meaning of my review title.
B00068V384|5.0|This is one of the greatest performances of Mozart Requiem in all recording history. As usual, this is a live recording of Celibidache. As you know, Celibidache was hated the \\"recorded music\\". He believed that, the music should be performed only in a concert hall and the audience, listeners should live that for one time, when the music playing in hall! But, if that performance was not recorded, we cannot listen that marvellous ocassion, anymore! <br /> <br />The tempos are incredible and very slow. Especially, in the first \\"Requiem aeternam\\" section, the tempo is Zen-like, and the Mnich Philharmonic and Mnich Chorus performed excellent. When you listen it, believe me, you can weep... And somewhere the tension ups, like in Dies irae movement. May be the tempi are slowly (not fast, tempestous as in Harnoncourt or Marriner versions) but Celibidache's ensemble played it very furious. So you can feel, \\"the Day of Judgement\\". The soloists are amazing. They sung very impressive, especially in Recordare. And I will not say about \\"Lacrymosa\\" movement. You know already that how it is pathetic... <br /> <br />The performance excellent and at this price, you must have that recording. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is one hell of a woman, and one hell of a star! Buy this!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|<br />And I have high expectations! The album is perfect for Workouts, Clubs and parties of course. Confessions is pretty much uptempo the \\"slow\\" track 'forbidden love' is still dance but more like laid back-dream-state-daft punk. Another great song is \\"get together\\" a great club anthem! <br />song There isnt a song on this album that cant be released as a single. Madonnas's lyrics are simplified in this album, there isnt much teaching but there she speaks a lot of positivity, LOVE, EMPOWERMENT and STREGNTH. The album is suitable for any age, childern too Although TRACK 5 \\"I love NY\\" has a line that uses the other word for 'cat'. ;) <br /> I really do enjoy this album and havent stoped playing since I first put it in my cd palayer. I hope you enjoy it just the same. <br />
0060528737|5.0|Garth Nix ends his wonderful trilogy with an explosive finale. Fast-paced, hard-hitting, pay-any-price-to-save-the-world kind of novel that people would hate to miss out on. Trust me, any die hard fantasy fan will praise Abhorsen.
6305177473|5.0|I saw this re-make most reluctantly. After all, I thought, how could it compare to the original blockbuster hit of the same name, which starred the adorable British actress, Hayley Mills? Well, to my complete surprise, this film is a winner in its own right. Reprising the  dual roles played by Hayley Mills, a young Lindsay Lohan, in her silver screen debut,  is surprisingly effective and adorable, making the dual roles her own.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with the premise of the film, two girls, Hallie Parker and Annie James (Lindsay Lohan), meet at summer camp. They look exactly alike. One lives with her father, while the other lives with her mother. They soon figure out the previously unknown but inescapable fact that they are twins, separated shortly after birth, each of whom lives with one of their biological parents. They both long to know the parent that is missing from their respective lives. So, they concoct a plan that will allow them to do so, leading to a scheme to reunite their estranged parents. They simply switch places, when it comes time to return home. Their reunion scheme is almost derailed, however,  when their biological father seems to have romantic designs on someone else.<br /><br />This comedic caper focuses on the intrigues of the twins as they try to get the potential usurper out of their father's life and re-unite their parents. Lindsay Lohan is simply terrific in the dual roles of Hallie and Annie, infusing a great deal of charm and personality into her portrayal of the twins. Natasha Richardson is wonderful in the role of the mother, Elizabeth James. While she lacks the feistiness of Maureen O'Hara, who originally played the role, Ms. Richardson manages to make the role her own with her low-key charm. Dennis Quaid is terrific as Nick Parker, the handsome, hunky father, who is the besotted prey of a gold digging, scheming, statuesque blonde (Elaine Hendrix). I actually like his performance better than that of Brian Keith, who played this role in the original.<br /><br />Blonde bombshell Elaine Hendrix is effective as Meredith Blake, the potential wicked step-mother, who quickly sees her own scheme to marry a wealthy husband go up in flames as the twins plot against her. Lisa Ann Walter is simply wonderful as Nick Parker's good-hearted housekeeper, infusing the role with a rich warmth. Simon Kunz is very funny in the role of Martin, the James' butler, creating a memorable character, and Ronnie Stevens is perfectly cast as the maternal grandfather, Charles James.<br /><br />As to whether or not their mother and father will be re-united, as the twins so desire, watch this film and find out. Although Lindsay Lohan does not sing the popular signature song, \\"Let's Get Together\\", which Hayley Mills sang in the original film, the viewer will not be disappointed by this re-make. Disney Studios, which is the studio responsible for both the original and the re-make, has created a terrific little comedic gem in its own right with this film.layed this role in the original.<br /><br />Blonde bombshell Elaine Hendrix is effective as Meredith Blake, the potential wicked step-mother, who quickly sees her own scheme to marry a wealthy husband go up in flames as the twins plot against her.

Madonna proves again why she remains #1. Brillant!  <br />

B000AL730Y|5.0|I grew up on the Beatle's and especially on Sir McCartney's music. I believe that he is one of the most if not THE most talented musician of our day and age. And this recording firmly reassures my belief. Any fan of Paul's really needs to get the DVD \\"Special Edition\\". It gives a little insight into the basis of some of the lyrics. Excellent quality and really brings out the real Paul McCartney.
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix writes fantastically in this fantasy novel. Describing things and places with a haunting beauty and given the characters substance and figure, giving them life with every page turn. Rich with action, horror, and mystery. If you are thinking about buying this novel, it's well worth every penny.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When i first heard the radio edit of hung up i thought 'yeah its a catchy tune' but there didnt seem to be a great dance rythm to it.... that was until i heard the video edit which is also the same on the album!I love the part where it grinds down right to the bass then builds itself back up again!Oh i could listen to it for years now! While hearing the whole album stream on Mtv's 'the leak' ive just been blown away to how fine this album sounds. <br /> <br />It plays just like a cream or clubland album which certainly gives this album in my opinion 'BEST DANCE ALBUM OF 2005' <br /> <br />If you are a club fanatic buy this album you wont regret it. Its high energy and dancetastic tracks really are cutting edge. <br />No offence to Madonna but if there was a remix of this album with only instrumentals it would be legend! <br /> <br />Favourite Tracks include <br /> <br />Hung Up - a fantastic track (just like video version) <br />Sorry - 'Talk is cheap' great lyrics my favourite track <br />Future Lovers - Great dance track <br />How High - great lyrics  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|No need to pretend I am a rock critic and drone on about what you will learn on the \\"Making of Born to Run\\" DVD.  The reason to buy this collection is for the Live show DVD.  \\"Kitty's Back\\" is nearly 20 minutes of pure rock-n-roll!  In fact the whole second set is fantastic.  The overall quality of sound is unbelievable and I only played it on my 2 speaker system.  I can only imagine what it sounds like in 5.1 Dolby.  After seeing the live show, my only wish is that they included a CD of it instead of the remastered \\"Born to Run\\" album.<br /><br />Time to release more shows, Boss!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is THE BEST CD I have purchased in years ! Madonna really hit the nail on the head with this one and gave all of us die-hard Madonna fans exactly what we've been waiting for.The entire CD is non-stop energy from the 1st to the last track !All you need to do is put it in and let it play,.. there isn't any need to fast-forward past the slow stuff because there ISN'T any slow stuff. I can't say anything negative about this one,... it's definitely full of many new top tens to come !
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Omg! This album is so amazing. I finally got this album today and I'm just loving it. I really miss those days. I love this album because it has really good 80s catchy beat and her singing sounded so pure and high-pitched. Her singing voice was really nice in those days. It sounded so cute. I love all the songs on this album! What I really like about Madonna is that she's strong, fearless, and outspoken. She's more like a leader. God, what can't I be more like this woman?<br /><br />1. Material Girl-I could definately relate to this song because I can be materialistic when it comes to clothes and stuff. I love to buy all the nice things. 5/5<br /><br />2. Angel- I love this song. It's so cute. It's the kind of song you could sing to your boyfriend. 5/5<br /><br />3. Like A Virgin- a song I know very well. I am like a virgin. People see me as innocent and can do no harm like a saint. 5/5<br /><br />4. Over and Over- This song is very upbeat and girly. 5/5<br /><br />5. Love Don't Live Here Anymore- I think this song really stands out because it shows that Madonna can really sing which not too many people give credit on that. It has more soul to it and she definately pull this one out. 5/5<br /><br />6. Dress You Up- The song talks about how she has something better in mind rather than dressing up in clothes. How cute. 5/5<br /><br />7. Shoo-Bee-Doo- This song has soul too and it's a really nice song to listen to with nice vocals. 5/5<br /><br />8. Pretender- My most favorite song on the album. I hate fake people. I just love the beats in the song. Very catchy and danceable. Very in-your-face kinda song. I love it so much! 6/5<br /><br />9. Stay- I love this song, too. I just love the synthesizers! That's what I love about the good old 80s! 6/5<br /><br />Bonus tracks: Very good remixes....5/5<br /><br />I would of course recommend this to all the true Madonna fans and all the virgins out there.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|Now, Mr.Gallagher tell me who is boring!!!! This album is actually one of the best pop/rock albums i listened to this year. After Escapology Robbie came back with a strong album and a very cool first single too. Tripping (which reminds me of the 80's).  <br /> <br />To all the fans of Robbie Williams, you won't regret it if you get this album.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
014100018X|4.0|A lovely little novel, one which grows on me more every time I reflect upon it.  The story is most enjoyable and the main character, the primary first person speaker, Vianne is a wonderfully constructed and complete, complex woman.  She provides the backbone for the tensions of sustaining dichotomies, forces of complimentary but contrary attributes which provide the balance necessary for their holders. Yin and Yang at its basic best.   Harris does magic like this for a number of counterparts every bit as magically as Vianne's hands upon chocolate in her chocolaterie. Vianne's opposing balance is the town priest, he who staunchly promotes the status quo to Vianne's newcomer with an open mind and differing ways.  There are numerous other balances like that, but the two most striking are those between mothers and children and those between an individual's past and his or her present.  In addition to this balancing, the secondary characters are quite enjoyable - I particularly like octogenarian Armande - as are the themes of friendship, what exactly constitutes sanity, and the mortality of us each.  Added happily to my shelf of good reading.
078322687X|4.0|We all remember being a teenager. A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.  John Hughes' movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic. If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did. Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.<br /><br />If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days. Think about your last year there. Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply. \\"The Breakfast Club\\" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest. Why would they need it? They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now. It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation. Because you can't dismiss something you understand.
0060196122|4.0|Veronika, depressed about having to face the same meaningless existence each day, decides that it would be better to die than to endure this fate.  She resolves to kill herself with a dose of sleeping pills, but for some reason she does not succeed.  She wakes up in a mental ward called Villete.  It is in Villete, after finding she only has a few days left to live that she learns what living means. <br /> <br />Who is Veronika?  Is she the woman who has expended so much energy creating an image of independence, or is she someone else trapped inside of that faade?  Had she exchanged her passions for the safety net of that empty routine? <br /> <br />Coelho convinces us that everyone is crazy in some way, but the craziest among us do only what others tell them.  What is normal anyway?  Normal is what many believe is right, and than it becomes right.  Who is insane?  The truly insane live as sheep, scared to stray from the herd for even a moment. <br /> <br />He urges us not to save our desire to live for some future that may never arrive.  Live in the present and at the last moment you'll not be flooded with a rush of things you wish you would have done. <br /> <br />While I've always found Coelho a bit idealistic, he remains dead on.  If there is something you want to do and it isn't hurting anyone else - do it.  Don't be afraid to fail or look foolish; be comfortable being uncomfortable... you only get one ride.  That doesn't sound too crazy to me. <br /> <br />Great book.  Read it. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is just such a fantastic album! <br /> <br />Any fans of Madonna's 80's music will like it. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of dance you will also like it.
B000AARKOO|2.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" isn't so much as bad movie as it is an unrelentingly dumb one.  Like all Ridley Scott movies, it is beautifully filmed, has some exciting battle scenes, and is competently performed.  However, it's storyline and character development are so silly that it insults the viewer's intelligence.  <br /> <br />\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was a box office disappointment.  Although several factors played a role in that outcome, the main reason was the decision to cast the effete, metrosexual, pretty-boy-du-jour Orlando Bloom as the star.  The role Mr. Bloom plays- the heroic \\"Balian\\"- demanded an actor who could believably portray a rugged leader of men.  Basically, Mr. Bloom was asked to play the kind of character that Russell Crowe performs so effortlessly.  Although the beard and the bulked-up body help a little, Mr. Bloom is just not believable.  The advertising campaign for KoH constantly reminded filmgoers that it was made by the director of \\"Gladiator.\\"  So why was \\"Gladiator\\" a huge hit and KoH a bomb?  I think the answer is pretty obvious- \\"Gladiator\\" had a Russell Crowe and KoH had Orlando Bloom.  Who would you follow into combat- Crowe's \\"Maximus\\" or Bloom's \\"Balian?\\" <br /> <br />Not only was it a poor decision to cast Mr. Bloom, the character he plays ranks as one of the most absurd in film history.  Balian is a blacksmith, but he's just not any blacksmith.  Instead, he is the most extraordinary blacksmith that ever lived!  Firstly, he knows how to read and write which would make him the most educated blacksmith in 12th century Europe.  Next, after a brief swordfighting lesson, he's able to easily defeat men who have trained since boyhood to be warriors.  We later find out that he must have learned civil and military engineering in his smithy and had time to study tactics, strategy, and the mindset of the Saracen leader, Saladin, as well.  Oh, he also has the ability to instantly bond with royalty so much so that he's offered a kingship.  Yet noble Balian rejects this offer because it would require killing a bad man.  Balian states that doing such a thing would endanger his soul. (However, such nobility did not keep him from committing the mortal sin of adultery with that man's wife.)  Basically, Balian is one of silliest and most unbelievable characters ever put to film. <br /> <br />KoH is a period film that makes no attempt whatsoever to present a portrait of how people actually thought and acted in the 12th century.  The issues and values extolled by the film's protagonists are 21st century ones dressed up in medieval costuming.  The heroes of the film are all presented as rational, egalitarian secularists.  However, rational, egalitarian secularists were pretty much non-existent in the 12th century.  Very few films truly attempt to transport a viewer back in time, and KoH is definitely NOT one of them. <br /> <br />One cannot make a movie about the crusades without offending someone.  Scott and his screenwriters attempted to walk a tightrope, but when they did court controversy they made sure that it was the Christian side that looked bad.  As others have noted- virtually every Christian religious leader is shown as a hypocrite and/or coward.  The Templars are shown as being pure evil (although the Hospitaller played by David Thewlis is one of those rational, egalitarian secularists).  Insulting Christianity is easy and painless because what the heck are Christians going to do about it?  Protest?  Boycott?  I don't think Hollywood would be shaking.  However, an artist portraying Islam in a bad light could lead to real trouble- just look to Salman Rushdie and Theodore Van Gogh.
0385508417|4.0|This is a great, funny, short read. Although it is meant for the holidays, it could be a humorous read at any time of the year if you need a break from thrillers.  Imagine a year without Christmas. No crowded malls, no corny office parties, no fruitcakes, no unwanted presents. That's just what Luther and Nora Krank have in mind when they decide that, just this once, they'll skip the holiday altogether. Theirs will be the only house on Hemlock Street without a rooftop Frosty; they won't be hosting their annual Christmas Eve bash; they aren't even going to have a tree. They won't need one, because come December 25 they're setting sail on a Caribbean cruise. But, as this weary couple is about to discover, skipping Christmas bring enormous consequences - and isn't half as easy as they'd imagined.<br /><br />I've read a lot of reviews that paint Luther Krank as the new Scrooge.  I don't get it.  I thought the idea of taking a 10 day cruise to be brilliant.  Not having to enter the mall or any store for that matter sounds like a dream to me.  Hmm.. now that gives me an idea....
0812550706|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card is, in my opinion, one of the best books of the time, despite the fact that it was first written over twenty years ago.  The characters are memorable, the plot intense and interesting.  This book is a must-read for everybody.  Whether you are an adult, a teenager like me, or even as young as ten, you will love it.  In it, the Buggers, an intelligent alien species, are a threat to humanity.  They have already struck twice with devastating consequences leaving the world on its knees.  But, this has created world peace for a short time, for fear of a common enemy.  The International Fleet is testing and taking the best and brightest children, starting at age seven, and bringing them up into space for military training.  The adults are hoping to find a boy that they can train to beat the Buggers, but now, time is running out.  Their best bet is Ender Wiggin, but can this boy save the world?
B00005JO1P|4.0|I'm no country music fan, but I remember liking Johnny Cash when I saw him on TV when I was a little kid, so I decided to check out this movie.  Overall, I didn't like it as much as Kevin Spacey's movie about Bobby Darin, \\"Beyond The Sea.\\"  But it was interesting and reminded me of some songs I haven't heard in 30 years, and they were better than I expected, even sung by the actors instead of singers.  The relationship between Cash and June Carter develops in a way that's both realistic and romantic, while his relationship with his father is also realistic but kinda sad.  Both of these relationships are resolved as the movie comes to an uplifting conclusion.  Joaquin Phoenix (Signs) is pretty good as Cash, though to me sometimes his performance seemed a bit over the top, but I'm no acting expert, I'm probably wrong.  However, I thought Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven) was sensational as June Carter and  Robert Patrick's (The X-Files) restrained performance as Cash's father was the sort that should win awards.  In conclusion, I think for fans of Johnny Cash or June Carter or Reese Witherspoon, this is a 5-star movie (10-stars where available!), and for the rest of us just a notch below, still definitely worth seeing, interesting and surprisingly upbeat.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|Consider this, music transcends language. Most listeners would probably not be able to tell a word of Icelandic but the album is nonetheless arrestingly charming.<br /><br />Not groundbreaking, Takk (thank you in Icelandic) seems very much the natural extension of (). Embedded in the songs are lush, ambient landscapes decorated with hauntingly emotive voiceovers that glide effortlessly across each track. Opener Takk (thank you in Icelandic) might seem like a relatively subdued affair but first single, Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li really sets the stage for the rest of the listening journey. A song that begins with beautiful Icelandic wails, Gl&oacute;s&oacute;li gradually builds into an explosion of dramatic crashes, likened to an emotional outburst of sorts. Then there is the 7 1/2-minute long Sægl&oacute;pur, which proves to be more light-hearted and almost even jovial in nature.<br /><br />Sigur Ros has once again created an egnimatic album. It's an emotional journey taken at the end of the 11 tracks.<br /><br />(Get the limited European edition which features equally enchanting expanded artwork in a hard bound book case.)
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the single most important record of the 1990s.  Period.
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is easily one of my top five from 2004.  I absolutely LOVE The Killers.  Their sound is grandiose and decadent.  Everything that every lover of glam rock could want. <br /> <br />While their songs on the radio and award shows are well known by now, the rest of the songs here are equally as good, not a bad one in the group.  I look very forward to their sophomore album. <br /> <br />If you don't own this one by now, where have you been?  Don't hesitate - get this one into your collection NOW.  If you already have this one and would like something similar, check out The Bravery's \\"The Bravery\\", if you haven't already.  Just as enjoyable (for me, anyway), yet much less known, at this point anyway.
B00005JO1S|5.0|Zathura<br /><br />During the first half of Zathura, I was thinking of subtracting one star for this review due to scientific flaws.  Destination Moon, made over 50 years ago, was more accurate.  However, by the end the story was so good it gets 5 stars anyway.<br /><br />It's about two brothers who find an old game, Zathura, in the basement, and when they play it, like in the same author's \\"Jumanji,\\" things start to happen.  A game card warns of a meteor shower, and real meteors breech the roof of the house.  It turns out once they started playing, the whole house has been displaced into outer space, and they have to finish the game to get back, even if it brings on horrendous aliens and other grave dangers.  It's more than just \\"Jumanji In Space\\" though, with some family lessons as good as, but different from that earlier film.<br /><br />The most glaring mistakes are:  One, when the house enters a gravity field.  We see things falling off shelves all over the house, and pieces falling off the outside of the house.  You don't have to be a science student; anyone who reads sci-fi (Heinlein, Clarke, etc.) knows that the house would fall at the same rate as everything in it and there would be no relative motion.  Furthermore, in the next scene there are still some dishes on the shelves to rattle and fall.  Two, they set a couch on fire and push it out into space, where it continues buring with visible yellow flames as it floats away.  Of course there's no oxygen in space and nothing would burn in that manner even if supplied with oxygen.  All that's really a shame because the movie could have had some educational value if they'd bothered to get some facts right.<br /><br />I guess you just have to take it as a children's fantasy instead of serious SF, and as such it's an exceptionally good movie.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|Okay I wont bore you with the plot (you've seen it all before anyway) or go into how new this films looks instead I warn anyone over 16 to stay away. Rent the first Indian Jones movie if you are in the mood for a good circa 1939 adventure. There is absolutely nothing new to discover in this flick. The pacing is dreary as well as the fuzzy CGI look to this thing. It's like watching a movie in your bathroom mirror after taking a hot shower. Instead of having fun with clich's this movie depends on them to tell us about the characters past relationships and motivations. the dialogue is never witty or clever and rings false from the flat Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law is two dimensional as well and lacks on butchness.  Really this is a movie for kids only and will put adults to sleep. The only moment worth watching here is the scene inside of Radio City Music Hall. Two characters are having a secret meeting with the Wizard of Oz in playing in front of them. The Wizard of Oz, now that's how to make a movie.
B0002X314C|5.0|Heres my story: <br />Saw him at the Essence Festival. Bought a bootleg copy. Loved it. Bought the real one.  Now, I'm happy :D
B0002EXH5E|5.0|First of all, don't hate this album just because its not as \\"metal\\" as Megadeth's prior albums. You should like a song or album because you like it, it hits a chord with you. Don't limit yourself to one genre. By saying you hate everything that isn't metal and love everything that is, you are a poser, plain and simple. You limit yourself by style, and not by actual music. <br />Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I love this album. It sounds great and is catchy as hell, and catchy isn't bad contrary to popular subculture belief. The songs show a retreat away from the normal thrash metal that Megadeth had done for so long. They obviously felt like doing something different, so let them. I applaud their effort because I am a fan of music, not just merely metal.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I like a lot this album, i think that is better than her debut cause she is more mature in this one. Avril is an excellent composer she writes all her songs, she is very talented in that way. She can perform VERY good, but sometimes she screams so much!. My fav. songs are:  Together, Don't Tell Me, How Does It Feel, My Happy Ending, Fall To Pieces, Slipped Away. Those are my personal favs. but all the songs are \\"cool\\"!. <br />Go Avril!
0618001905|5.0|Two separate stories are told in King Leopold's Ghost.  First and foremost is the story of greed and arrogance exhibited by King Leopold and the Belgians' colonization of the Congo.  It's simply amazing what sorts of atrocities were committed during Europe's colonization of Africa...I had always thought things were bad, but nothing like what was illustrated here. The second storyline is of the human rights activism that was really born during the same time period.  Without this piece, King Leopold's Ghost would be a truly depressing book.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very well written, informative account of the colonization of the Congo.  While reading this book, I was depressed that man could sink to such low levels, and that the Congo is just one of many human rights attrocities committed throughout history...at least there are some out there fighting the good fight.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Most of the people who reviewed this cd were children. So, you can say only little girls and boys feel this music right? No. Even though I'm not a die hard fan of 50 cent nor am I one who chaints \\" G-UNOT\\" or flaunt my g-unot shirt wherever I go. I still think this CD was great.It wasn't better than Get Rich or Die trying ( Kind of stupid making a movie after a cd) But, it was a decent sophmore album. There's a lot of songs on there that you wouldn't waste any money on but, theres some that are pretty cool. No Doubt you should go get the Game album if you haven't got it yet! But, this cd is better than what others are saying it is.
B0000630BT|4.0|When I hear everyone call Judas Preist THE 'Metal Gods', I have no bloody idea where they get that from, honestly. I always labeled them hard rock hearing songs like, 'You Got Another Thing Comin'' and 'Head Out To The Highway'. When I borrowed 'Painkiller' from my buddy and got used to it, because you see, I wanted really to own a true heavy metal record, I got hooked and this could possibly be my favorite record I currently own. I could have done without the bonus tracks, but I won't complain because all the original tracks rock ! My personal favorite song besides 'Painkiller' must be 'One Shot At Glory'. <br /> <br />The lyrics are cheesy, but in my opinion, many Metal lyrics are cheesy even if they're good (Dio). Painkiller excels at speedy drumming, soaring vocals, and killer solos. Ya love long solo sections...buy this ! This could be an average album if it was'nt for it's consistent aggressive well written music.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|By the time I heard the song Hung Up (Before the release date of CD), I firmly believe that Madonna have more new experiments on her album, Confessions on a Dance Floor.  I have the album, and listen to each and every track, believe me - I was not dissapointed.  I am very impressed with this album.  This twelve track album is a non-stop, all-dance music.  After each and every song, a new song immediately comes in without any pause with each track.  If you want to experience a disco environment at your home, just put this CD in your sound system.  Her songs have a vibe to 70s and 80s concept, and has a modern twist.  Hope you won't mind me saying this - I really love the album artworks.  I was so impressed how Madonna poses - Her body rocks!!!!  No wonder she's in a very good shape at an age of 47.  Trust me, this CD won't let you dissapoint.  Buy this CD.  It is worth to buy.  You'll surely dance....

B00005JO1G|4.0|Gulf War Marines are watching an old war movie in a Marine base theatre just prior to deployment to The Gulf War, and are whooping, hollering, and cheering their compatriots on like frenzied spectators at a college football game. Just one day in the life of a Gulf War Marine, and \\"Jarhead\\", effectively uses this common perspective of your average joe, in a less than glorious war, standing tall, armored and prepared, but mostly disallusioned and bored, as action sought is never found, and the blood of the enemy never tasted. Indeed, these Marines fill in the missing gaps of glory with their own personal triumphs and trauma, even firing rounds of ammunition into the empty desert night sky as closure to a war they hadn't entirely witnessed. There is almost nothing in \\"Jarhead\\", that hasn't been seen in other war movies, yet these stock wartime scenes and situations stand like pillar stones to a war secured before it even began by American manipulative control, (the same could not be said about the current Iraqui situation.). While there are several ugly conflict induced scenes in \\"Jarhead\\", the film does not bombard with the horrors of war, but instead, asks us to consider our current politically aggressive state, while preserving our regard for the soldiers committed to carrying out America's decisions. As one sharp-shooter in the film puts it, \\"Let's leave politics out of it. We're here. That's what really matters.\\" And while \\"Jarhead' doesn't particularly make you proud to be an American, it makes you proud of our American soldiers. The film has a glistening yellow napalm sky meeting white desert sand beauty to it, and performances by lead Jake Gyllenhaal, as your typical home town hero, who says he's a Marine because he got lost on his way to college, and Jamie Foxx, as a Bible-reading, god-spitting Staff Seargent regulation guy, are as strong and reserved as you could expect from a fighting Marine. As for escalating drama and eye-popping action and adventure, you'll have to rent an old war movie for that. This is the real stuff.ll have to rent an old war movie for that. This is the real stuff.
B000001ELL|4.0|This album is only worth something if you are an Ace Frehley fan! Hard times, Save your love, and a cover of the stones 2000 man all are worth four stars and worth getting this album. Though never getting any air play because publisist anounce this was a kissco album not a regular Kiss album or another Ace Frehley solo album it was ignored by radio stations except for I was made for loving you (typical Paul Stanely song couldn't write it by himself and it is a pittiful attempt to go with the trends of the day!!!) Hard times is brilliant love the guitar changes and the beat is just one of those ones that gets you up and moving!Lyrically it really reaches out towards kids having hard times!Save your love great melody with incredible harmonies brilliant writing on Ace's part! 2000 man the space man puts the needed touches to make this his own and it works!!!

Ako vam treba ljubav tu je Picture This i Pretty Baby. Ako vam je potreban dodir hladnog futurizma Blondie vam nude Fade Away And Radiate. <br />Apsolutno savrseno. Nezamenljivo i nezaboravno ostvarenje. <br />Zanimljivo je to da se posle albuma Parallel Lines nista nije dogodilo sa takvom energijom sve do 2003 kada su bend Yeah Yeah Yeahs izdali Fever To Tell.

B00008WT5E|5.0|This album if you listen to every song has every type of music that ac/dc has ever played bluesy, hard, funny, fast, slow, simple, complicated, and just good old dirty rock. Probably Bon's best album lyrically! I love this album and listen to it more than any other ac/dc album! If you like all the differences earlier talked about this is a must, not just for an ac/dc fan but for all rock fans!!!!!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I initially didn't like the album but it grew on me over a few days. Interestingly, no one track stands out as a popular fave. Practically every track has lots of people who like and dislike it. <br />This being my third Madonna album, I thought I'd know what to expect. I'm 15 now and I didn't know much of Madonna before. But I was wrong. This album is just so different and there's something about it all that makes it amazing. The lyrics (other rhan on I Love NYC) and the music blend really well.. it seems so out of this world. I like that it's dancy and all but she sings about things that are meaningful and intelligent like on How High. <br />Definitely worth at least a few listens. <br />
0553801503|5.0|I think you'll get a lot more out of this book if you read the series UPTO it first. Its well written and fits like a glove to the previous books in the series. I was drawn into the story, as always. This is one of my favorite writers.
B000066C1N|4.0|I don't really like the movie\\"Spirit\\",it has a good story,and the begining is quite attracting.But then I found it a little boring.The soundtrack is cool and I enjoy listening to it,but i'm afraid it has the same problem as the movie.For each song the first 2 minutes are great,but when it is reaching the end,I find myself hard not to skip it.I think the same melodies are replayed too many times in each song.Still,I like this CD,though it's not perfect.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Hey, guess what? This is a real good film. Actually, the first half of this production is an excellent movie and the second half is still pretty darned-good.<br /><br />As the title implies \\"Batman Begins\\" is an origin story. This is usually my favorite part of Superhero epics -- how about you? The filmmakers took some interesting risks in casting a lesser-known, though strong actor -- Christian Bale. Bale fits the role and the costume well. He's brooding, strong, vulnerable, yet decisive -- and perhaps even more than all of that -- as about as real/believable as Batman gets.<br /><br />Another surprise is director Christopher Nolan of the highly acclaimed Memento. For those who haven't seen this unique, yet brain-straining feature; suffice to say that Nolan is great with thought and suspense -- but action? What an exciting risk to employ. Personally, I think these risks pay off in spades. This is a film that cares a great deal for what is going on inside the Bat-Man's head; the action is more of an accent.<br /><br />The fight scenes are shot close in; Nolan seems to have made a conscious decision not to compete with other more \\"martial arts\\" hand-to-hand action flicks. His action scenes are dark, the sounds and movement jeer a chill or more accurately -- fear.<br /><br />Building a solid motif around fear, this strong screenplay unfolds masterfully until the two-thirds mark, at which point some of the pacing slips just a bit, and further complications blur its initial beauty. I enjoyed the idea of the masked foe introduced at that point, but his actual execution on film smacked of the phony supervillians I didn't like in earlier Batmans. That said, the film's other foes are well-acted, enjoyable, respectably intimidating.<br /><br />A good film -- you'll get your money's worth.
0312330529|5.0|Just read the bio on the inside back cover:  \\"born in Melbourne... addicted to heroin... committed a series of robberies with an imitation pistol... nineteen years in prison... escaped!  For ten of those [fugitive] years, he lived in Bombay where he established a free medical clinic for slum-dwellers, and worked as a conterfeiter... gunrunner...\\" <br /> <br />All of that is what this gorgeously written book is about; by someone who actually lived it.  Yet the writing is incredible, memorable, transporting at times.  What a combination:  a page-turner that's so incredible it couldn't possibly be realistic (but is, in fact, largely true) written beautifully. <br /> <br />What could be better? <br /> <br />If this guy has another great book in him, I can't wait. <br /> <br />
0684824906|5.0|This is a great book. It teaches a lot of History and holds the readers attention.
0307276902|2.0|While Frey's details of his actual addiction and the struggle within are believable, the story itself hardly is truthful. <br />The treatment center, the characters, and the outrageous plotlines seem purely fictional.  The characters, the ending and other plotlines are done too perfectly, and are written exactly as a fictional piece would be written.   <br />Was Frey an addict? - yes, probably <br />Is this an accurate account of his time at rehab? - most likely not <br />The writer should have either written the truth of his time in rehab or have the book published as fiction loosely based on his struggle with addiction. To tout this book as an autobiographical memoir, seems just wrong.
B00000K19E|5.0|If there has to be a quint- essential film for the end of the millennium, this is it. I've never seen a movie that blended so exhilaratingly high-concept science- fiction, nerve pounding action and philosophical allegory, a movie in which content and style are so in synch. Keanu Reeves (surprisingly cool in Jet Li mode) stars as Thomas Anderson, a mild-mannered software programmer who moonlights as an expert hacker under the name of Neo. His existence is about to change drastically when he's contacted by a mysterious group of rebels led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne, impeccable), who believes that Neo is the chosen one and is determined to prepare him to face his destiny : freeing the human race from the Matrix. Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is; you have to see it for yourself. Besides, I don't want to spoil one of the film's pleasures, which is to gradually discover the truth at the same time as Neo. I'll just say it has something to do with the world as we know it being just an illusion created by an empire of intelligent machines where a small Resistance struggle to defeat the deadly Agents.<br /><br />The film was written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, whose sexy, stylish film noir \\"Bound\\" was an extremely promising debut. I was really looking forward to see what they would do with some real money, and man was I not disappointed. Their sophomore effort is unique, ambitious and thought-provoking. The plot is very interesting: it's an exploration of how much we can or can not trust what our minds sense as reality. The film's nightmarish theory is that what we call reality is actually some kind of computer enhanced virtual reality. Therefore, it is possible to bend or break the rules we take for granted, gravity for instance. That's what Neo, Morpheus and their crew (which include Carrie-Anne Moss as a tough babe and Joe Pantoliano as a shady lad) are set to do, and so are the Wachowski brothers. With plenty of imagination ant the first-rate SFX to support it, they crafted one of the most visually stunning films ever.<br /><br />What's amazing is that all the nifty visual tricks they use never feel forced or show-offy: it always feels natural within the film's universe. I also love the idea that the characters are able to download knowledge unto their brains. The Wachowski had the particularly brilliant brainchild to have their heroes use this technique to turn themselves into experts at jiu-jitsu, kung fu, tae kwan do, kempo and even drunken boxing! This leads to some of the most out-of-this-world fights this side of Hong Kong (the fights were actually choreographed by HK legend Yuen Wo Ping). This is in part what makes \\"The Matrix\\" so special. Unlike most high-concept sci-fi (like last year's \\"Dark City\\"), it is not only visionary and intelligent but also as action packed as any Aliens or Blade. It's the kind of movie that never stops surprising you. In a way, \\"The Matrix\\" is about the magic of cinema itself, about how filmmakers like the Wachowski bros simulate reality and have the power to bend its rules to fit their vision.e first-rate SFX to support it, they crafted one of the most visually stunning films ever.  <br /> <br />What's amazing is that all the nifty visual tricks they use never feel forced or show-offy: it always feels natural within the film's universe.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out as i have been really impressed by madonna's more recent stuff. and i am not dissapointed every song is amazing and the way each song mixes into the next is fantastic, the best tracks in my opinion are 'Issac' with its hypnotic chants along side big beats and 'forbiden Love' which is just amazing and dreamy, all of the tracks are amazing and if you want a c.d for any occasion eg chilling in ur room, partying, getting dolled up or even driving then this is the c.d for you..  <br /> <br />
B0000AQS6R|5.0|It's funny, some people have reacted very negativly towards this movie, as if it mocks the sacred ritual of a family Christmas. To those folks I first say, get real, then I challenge anyone to claim that they never experienced a Christmas that was at least going in the direction of this already classic tale.<br /><br />In this movie we are back with this Griswold's, this time at home, and Clark plots to create the uiltimate, old fashiond, fun, family Christmas. Need we say more.<br /><br />From a run in with rednecks while they are tree hunting, to Clark's stringing up the outside lights, to a house full of often disinterested in-laws (VERY typical of our parents generation). Clark brings new meaning to the phrase, \\"no good dead goes unpunished\\".<br /><br />As noted by other reviewers, Randy Quaid is a standout as cousin Eddie, and his powder blue Leisure Suit. However he is almost trumped by the next door yuppie, Margo, played by Julia Dryfuss (Seinfeld's Elaine). Yes, someone played her husband, but Margo truly ruled her all too trendy roost. As a Christmas present to us all Margo has an encounter with a squirel, and then Decks The Hall with her husband, Todd.<br /><br />Is there a lesson here?, yes, think hard and fast before planning your own fun, old fashioned, family Christmas. Although this movie has the true to form, Hollywood Happy Ending, not all fun, old fashioned, family Christmasses end happy.<br /><br />However, most imporatntly, this movie is a comedy, and enjoy it as such. A great feature of Christmas Vacation is that you could watch this movie every night for a week, and still pick out something new. Watch for the scene in the house with the TV broadcasting the Chicago Christmas Parade, and the now legendary scene with Clark shopping at Marshall Feild's.<br /><br />I noticed that you can buy this DVD in a bundle pack with the more recent movie, A Christmas Story. Sorry, but in my opinion, A Christmas Story is the most annoying Christmass movie EVER.<br /><br />A better choice for a Christmas Double feature?, pair this with the true classic, Miracle on 34th Street (see my review), or the campy, often overlooked, Christmas In Connecticut.movie EVER. <br />A better choice for a Christmas Double feature?, pair this with the true classic, Miracle on 34th Street (see my review), or the campy, often overlooked, Christmas In Connecticut. <br /> <br />
B0007Y08I8|4.0|How do you review a film with a musical theme that exclaims, \\"America, F--- Yeah!\\" It's tough because: a) You need a dirty word thesaurus to avoid filing a review with more expletives than an Andrew Dice Clay rant, and b) It's hard to work when you're constantly giggling to yourself incessantly.<br /><br />\\"Team America: World Police\\" is the anti-blockbuster. The characters are marionette puppets whose strings are in plain sight because it's funny. The voice-overs don't sound anything close to the celebrities and politicians they're representing, because it's funny. But much of the dialogue--with the exception of the cursing--could be pulled straight from any Jerry Bruckheimer film...because it's funny.<br /><br />\\"South Park\\" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker offend everyone in \\"Team America\\"--foreign and domestic leaders, conservatives and liberals, outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces and...outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces. But one thing they are clearly critical of is the United States foreign policy mentality of kick ass now, ask questions later. If there's a hell, Parker and Stone will be living in the penthouse.<br /><br />But let's talk about the puppets. The marionettes look slick. When they speak, the movements of their mouths fluidly match their words. In other words, they put Milli Vanilli to shame. And the stuff that they can't do without herky jerky silliness, namely Kung Fu fighting and love making, comes off as so hilarious that it's almost too bad all movie actors couldn't be replaced by puppets.<br /><br />Team America is a no-holds-barred freedom fighting force that's called in whenever there's an international emergency. They live in Mt. Rushmore, drive souped up super vehicles and wield rocket launchers. The team is led by Spottswoode, a debonair smooth talker with an ambiguous sexual preference. When one of the team members is killed by terrorists (who speak a broken record of \\"Jihad bakakakaka\\"), Spottswoode recruits Broadway thespian Gary Johnston to \\"act\\" his way past the terrorists and infiltrate their treacherous network. Unbeknownst to Team America in the beginning, North Korean leader Kim Jung II, is secretly supplying terrorists with WMDs. Kimmy is probably the most hysterically rendered---and most un-PC character. I can't give out more information without committing a hate crime.<br /><br />While Team America takes out their targets, they also take out many people and international treasures that aren't their target, a.k.a collateral damage. They take out the Eiffel Tower, the Sphinx and thousands of innocent puppets. And when they do, they draw the ire of the Film Actors Guild (an acronym I don't need to dwell on...but one that \\"Team America\\" does). An obviously spoof on the Screen Actors Guild, it comprises Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and other celebrities who use their notoriety as a political soapbox. Of course, now, actors are using their notoriety as a soapbox to speak out against \\"Team America\\" in some sort of ironic countermeasures. Confused? Me too.<br /><br />If you don't know anything about \\"Team America: World Police,\\" when you step into the theater, you'll be like a rich kid on Christmas morning. You'll get every damned thing you want, from hot puppet sex to gory puppet deaths, playful songs with illicit lyrics and more.

0316172324|2.0|After his bestselling book brought the phrase \\"tipping point\\" into popular usage, which is that moment when an idea, product or concept suddenly catches fire with the population at large, Malcolm Gladwell now gives us two more phrases that are likely to become equally well-known: \\"blink\\" and \\"thin-slicing.\\"<br /><br />We \\"blink\\" when we think without thinking. We do that by \\"thin-slicing,\\" using limited information to come to our conclusion. What's interesting is that in our age of information overload, according to Gladwell, we often make better decisions with snap judgments than we do with volumes of analysis.<br /><br />The book opens with what reads like a heart-racing detective story about the discovery of a statue that initially fooled one group of art experts for being genuine and was later shown to be a fake by another group. The first group had exhaustively studied and analyzed the statue. Members of the second took one look --- \\"blinked\\" --- and declared it suspect and ultimately a forgery. And they were right. Why? How did they know? Why was the first group so wrong? Are there dangers in overanalyzing? Are we always right when we blink? Can we be wrong, even dead wrong? What is the science behind blinking? What can we learn from this phenomenon?<br /><br />Gladwell addresses these questions and gives a wide range of examples of blinking from the worlds of gambling, speed-dating, tennis, war games, the movies, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. Interspersed are accounts of scientific studies that partially, but never completely, explain the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives. Nevertheless, the hypotheses, the scientific experiments, and the examples are very interesting.<br /><br />A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, \\"There's something wrong here,\\" and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls \\"the locked box\\" in our brains, our fireman just \\"blinked\\" and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.<br /><br />It took well over two hours of questioning for the fire lieutenant to piece together how he knew to get out. (First, the fire didn't respond as it was supposed to; second, the fire was abnormally hot; third, it was quiet when it should have been noisier given the heat.)<br /><br />One take-away from the book is that how we blink is a function of our experiences, training, and knowledge. For example, prejudice is so unconsciously woven into our society that, despite our best intentions, at an unconscious level it can lead to really bad blinks. This is partly why tall people are frequently seen as natural leaders when there is no basis in reality for that belief. And, in the case of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, it is why four policemen incorrectly thin-sliced a situation and wound up killing an innocent man by mistake.<br /><br />Gladwell is obviously fascinated by the phenomenon of blinking. Properly understood --- and properly prepared for --- it is a valid way to make decisions. Gladwell says, \\"A world where snap judgments and thin-slicing is taken seriously is a better place.\\" I know some people who might object to that viewpoint, particularly when it comes to decision-making in foreign policy, but if you want an entertaining read, fast-paced, rich in entertaining anecdotes and some unusual scientific research, then BLINK is worth picking up.le who might object to that viewpoint, particularly when it comes to decision-making in foreign policy, but if you want an entertaining read, fast-paced, rich in entertaining anecdotes and some unusual scientific research, then BLINK is worth picking up.
B00005JNTX|4.0|While the new Robert Rodriguez film, Frank Miller's Sin City, is not a horror movie, it isn't not a horror movie. (Yep, I got A's in English.) One of the coolest things about this tres cool movie is, you can't pigeonhole it. Punching, kicking and slashing its way through every genre imaginable - chiefly film noir, comic, mystery, action, drama, romance, and thriller - Sin City has more severed heads, dismemberments and cannibalism themes than The Silence of the Lambs and Freddy Vs. Jason put together. I loved it!<br /><br />It is based on author/illustrator Miller's series of graphic novels of the same name. The plotlines include elements from the stories The Babe Wore Red, The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and more. Like the phantasmagoric storybooks, the lush yet stark look of the movie is achieved by using satiny black and white enhanced with splashes of color. Early buzz has Miller's fans thinking that only Miller fans will glom onto the cinematic Sin City. Not so - I'd never read or even saw one of his books in my life before viewing this dark delight, yet I was on board from start to finish. It's only April 1, but I can easily say that Sin City is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />A metropolis bled morally dry, Basin City is the site of three torrid tales that follow several larger than life characters through their lives and, for some of them, their deaths. Each one is a man on a mission that takes him down a rabbit hole to an urban nightmare of seedy alleys, strip clubs, into cheap motel rooms, and around winding back roads to rescue, defend, or avenge a woman.<br /><br />Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a no-nonsense cop who, after saving a little girl (Makenzie Vega) from a brutal child-rapist named Junior (Nick Stahl), is punished for his good deed and spends the next ten years in a solitary prison cell. Once released, Hartigan has cause to thank heaven for the little girl who's grown up in the most delightful way: Nancy (Jessica Alba) is now a lasso-swinging exotic dancer who's fallen deeply in love with him. But Hartigan and Nancy's troubles start all over again when Junior reemerges (now as a Max Schreck/Nosferatu styled creep called Yellow Bastard).<br /><br />Marv (Mickey Rourke) has a churlish countenance, but at his center is a heart of Goldie - Goldie (Jaime King) being the pulchritudinous prostitute who was murdered after their one glorious night together. Marv makes it his quest to hunt down and kill her killer. This is the flagship story, and it's wonderfully infused with Rourke's pervading presence (though they might should have lightened up on the prosthetics a tad; he doesn't look like a real person).<br /><br />Another story in the anthology follows Dwight (Clive Owen), a red Converse-wearing, trench-coated Weegee'esque newspaper photographer who has a hand in committing a most unfortunate murder and then must go to great lengths (and depths!) to cover it up.<br /><br />While the anthology ostensibly follows its male residents, Sin City would be dull indeed without its firecracker female characters. Following film noir and classic detective novel convention, the women are kicked as often as they're kissed - but they give as good as they get. Dangerous dames line the city's highrise rooftops like beautiful but deadly gargoyles, protecting their turf from all comers. Tough cookies, hookers, strippers, and cocktail waitresses abound, as do Kill Bill styled assassins (Devon Aoki's \\"Miho\\" would give Chiaki Kuriyama's \\"Gogo\\" a real run for her blood money), barely-clad lesbians, and the female trophies of a literal head-hunter. Miho's pimp is played with fishnet panache by Rosario Dawson.<br /><br />The Big Sleep wakes up in a hi-def, CGI world with glorious results, akin to film noir on acid. Rodriguez famously chronicled bootstrap moviemaking methodology in his book, Rebel Without A Crew; while he certainly had a lot of help with Sin City (Miller co-directs and cameos as a priest, while Quentin Tarantino also helms a short, gruesomely comic passage), you can definitely see his stamp here. You can hear it, too - as per usual, he composed most of the score himself. Even with his cinematography, Rodriguez faithfully reproduces the chiaroscuro palette of Miller's novels. The screenplay (also credited to Mr. R... does this guy do the catering, too?) tempers the characters' cynicism with believable flashes of hope and sentiment.<br /><br />Dialogue and 40s pulp noir voiceovers are punctuated with clich&eacute;s and gallows humor even as explosive, stylized violence unfolds onscreen. The cast of dozens all nosh the scenery, even when they don't have a word to say - the mute, lethal and utterly vile villain, Kevin (Elijah Wood), is a character you won't soon forget. Smaller roles with Rutger Hauer, Carla Gugino, and Powers Boothe are also sure to resonate with audiences.<br /><br />A famous line from a classic noir film matter-of-factly says, \\"There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them.\\" Sin City has at least three, but here's hoping for more in the future.s as a priest, while Quentin Tarantino also helms a short, gruesomely comic passage), you can definitely see his stamp here.

B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Rocky is a fine and fond movie that attracts adjectives: gritty, tough, tender, affecting, inspiring, warmly human, really neat. Small is beautiful is a concept that can also apply to this art form. Sylvester Stallone (The Lords of Flatbush) wrote the screenplay and plays the lead in this movie. In an interview, he has stated: \\"I think the primary objective of creative art - of film art - is to create these simplistic stories that touch everyone and affect their lives through giving them heroes, through answering questions.\\"<br /><br />The hero we get in Rocky is \\"the Italian Stallion,\\" a hard-muscled southpaw boxer who's not bad enough to quit and not good enough to make it into the big time. A trainer at the gym in the Philadelphia slum where he lives tells him: \\"You're a tomato...You got the heart but you fight like an ape.\\" In his spare time, Rocky works as a heavy for a loan shark. But he can't even bring himself to break the thumb of a client since he knows the man may be worse off than he is. Rocky's heart goes out to Adrian, an ugly duckling who blooms under the nurturance of his love. She becomes devoted to him.<br /><br />Fate tips its hat when Apollo Creed, the heavyweight champ, chooses him as his replacement opponent in a special contest to celebrate the Bicentennial. No one believes that Rocky has a chance. But he surprises everyone including himself. Sylvester Stallone's performance is sheer magic - an authentic and touching portrait of a loser who becomes a winner in the things that matter. Talia Shire is excellent as Adrian; Burgess Meredith, mangy as his manager; and Burt Young, good as Adrian's touchy brother. John Avildsen's direction is a tour de force of style and substance.<br /><br />Not only does Rocky give us a memorable hero, but as Stallone promised it answers basic questions. Is it worth sticking with one's dreams? Yes, no matter what. Is winning the most important thing in a contest? No, it's the courage to go the distance with the best that one's got that counts. Is success the highest achievement? No, love matters much more. Don't miss Rocky - it's one of the best films of 1976!e best that one's got that counts. Is success the highest achievement?

B000060MWU|5.0|I am amazed that people are actually reviewing a David Lynch film and just go on and on about the DVD transfer and next to nothing about the plot, dialogue, or theory of Lost Highway.<br /><br />Why do they think true abstract thinkers cannot get over a relatively small technical detail and get to the point, which is how can this tale of fragmented human existence relate to me??????  In particular, the murder scenes of the wife are particularly grainy and are flashed briefly on screen.  This does not seem a coincidence to me.  It actually adds to the mystery to not \\"really\\" see the action.  Viewers are required to use their imagination and experience to make sense of this piece of work.  Perhaps, a flawless transfer of bright, sharp images would satisfy some, but I feel that the grainy look of this film complements the grating feel of the twisted plot and the jarring, discordant, alternative rock soundtrack.  I love David Bowie's I'm Deranged opening and closing the movie; this is spiritually uplifting.  I had the soundtrack before I saw the film.<br /><br />Therefore, to be really useful, I suggest that the film is about the obsessive nature of alpha males who live life to the nth degree and never really pay too much for that privilege. Being chock full of testosterone has it's rewards and punishment.  Lost Highway has a strong supernatural aspect that is fine if you believe in things supernatural, whether it's Jesus, white magic, or the Devil.  Compare Angel Heart with Mickey Rourke for the devilish theme and dual identities.  Lost Highway is spooky and about a real segment in life that basically, \\"only comes out at night.\\"  There is also the feeling that if you somehow escape your destiny, at best, your ending is just prolonged, and you are what you are no matter what.<br /><br />Consider these possibilities: the yellow brick road, the stairway to Heaven, or Lost Highway.  Pick one and be on your Journey.  David Lynch has given us a blue print/road map for the Lost Highway (full-tilt lust) that should illuminate the pathway for those \\"choosing\\" to travel there.  The same is true of Saint Paul and God's stairway to Heaven, or Hollywood culture's get-rich-quick schemes on a yellow brick road.  We have all these choices for where we can go and how to get there.<br /><br />I have been warned by Lost Highway, and have no desire to go there.  Nor do I want to \\"escape\\" my destiny.

B00003CX95|5.0|Okay, to tackle this one first off.  Of course there are historical inaccuracies.  How else could you make a movie in a two hour time period and still attempt to portray the lasting impact that the events had?  The previous reviewer can list off as much as he wants, but if that is the case then don't watch historical movies.  While you are at it, bash Elizabeth (which crammed most of her reign into a short year or so time period in order to make the story, which turned out wonderful as well despite its inaccuracies) or any other historical movie.  And, if you do take the view of the history that any non-judgmental historian would take, you would have seen that the English did treat the Scots horribly.  Does this mean we stereotype you now, today?  Uh, no, but it most certainly was there, regardless of how it makes the English look.  It was the time period, as you look at the society itself and see that that was the norm (i.e. Philip IV of France condemned the Templars so that he could confiscate their money; a holy order battling infidels, done away with for greed; its the time, not the people).      Okay, that aside, the movie was wonderful.  The storyline is, of course, not entirely accurate (prima nocta is a fabrication to further the story).  For the most part, as with any historical movie, bits and pieces are going to be thrown together in order to make a complete story.  After all, it is a movie, with the ultimate goal being to entertain.  This wasn't made for the history channel, after all.  Granted, it is violent and gruesome, but what do you expect from this time period?  The viewer should have known this going into it, as any person who has read anything about this time period would understand what they are getting themselves into.    The cinematography is amazing, and couple that with the soundtrack and you have a majestic movie.  The acting is wonderful as well.  All in all, a wonderful movie, one of my all time favorites, and I would recommend to everyone.
B00005JO1P|4.0|James Mangold's \\"Walk the Line\\" is a decent, slightly plodding show-biz biopic that benefits mightily from the astonishing talents of its two stars. If you've seen the film biographies of Elvis, Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, etc., then you've seen this one; the screenplay is fairly standard and doesn't trim all the fat from the story. During some of the expository scenes, I found that I didn't keep my eyes wide open all the time. But when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were on stage together singing, I was all eyes and ears. Phoenix and Witherspoon have so much electricity together that they virtually give off sparks, and if they don't sound exactly like Johnny Cash and June Carter, they're both good singers and do up the Cash-Carter songbook in fine style. Virtually everybody knows the basic outlines of Cash's story, and it's a story as old as the hills: a good man, beset by tragedy and personal demons, finds redemption through faith in God and the love of a good woman. If Mangold's exposition sometimes gets in the way of the story, Phoenix's performance never does; he brings Cash's pain to galvanizing life, capturing the essence of the man without ever resorting to a mere impressionist's trickery. A few critics have accused Witherspoon of giving us too much Reese and not enough June. I don't know enough about June Carter to tell; I only know that Witherspoon is so charming, funny, impassioned and real here that who cares whether she captures Carter exactly? Among the supporting players, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job as Cash's first wife Vivian, and it's not her fault that she appears in some of the more boring scenes. Phoenix and Witherspoon are sure to be remembered at Oscar time, and they are the urgent, overriding reasons to go see \\"Walk the Line.\\"
0425152251|4.0|A lot of people really love this book as a creative introduction to philosophy.  The philosophic material has been incorporated into a novel surrounding a young girl in Norway.  I liked the book, and I am extremely impressed at the creative thinking that went into writing something like this.  The problem I had was that I didn't identify too much with the story, and would have preferred just straight discussions on philosophy.  For me, reading something like The Story of Philosophy is more interesting.  I do realize that the reading preferences of many others could make this book something extremely special to them, and well-suited to exploration of philosophical principles.  I know plenty of people feel that way about the book, and I really admire the book because of that.  Anything like this, that can inspire and interest in philosophy among young and old readers alike has enormous value.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about philosophy.
B00006AW2O|5.0|Well as a teenager of the 1960s this was my music. There are a lot of great reviewers on the Amazon site, with a plethora of knowledge and information about the Stones and their recordings. I will discuss the Blues End.<br /><br />The Stones with Brian Jones started as a Blues Band. That was their primary interest. They got to record this LP at Chess Studios which to me, as a guitarist, would be like a getting to Jam with Albert King. They met Muddy Waters, got offered songs from Willie Dixon, met and had Little Walter on their next UK tour and so on. This was an essential background to the 1960s Blues Revival which started the careers of Eric Clapton, Paul Butterfield, Albert King, Otis Rush, John Mayall and so on.<br /><br />The tunes, as discussed in previous reviews, are not of uniform brilliance. They were basically tunes they had been performing live for a few years in London clubs. Of the lot \\"Around and Around\\" is probably the best and the tune that helped get Chuck Berry back on a career track! It is great, especially the Johnny Otis shuffle in the bridge! \\"It's All Over Now\\" also helped the career of Bobby Womack-a great R&B guitar man and soul singer. This tune was a massive hit in the summer of 1964 and has one of the best vocals the Early Stones ever did. The long fade out ending was a prelude the the Beatle's \\"Hey Jude\\" a few years later. \\"Good Times Bad Times\\", an early Jagger-Richards attempt, was a great use of acoustic 12-string guitar. Probably influenced Jimi Hendrix's \\"Hear My Train A-Comin'\\".<br /><br />My personal favourite on this LP is \\"Confessin the Blues\\", a 1940s Blues Standard penned by pianist Jay McShann. It was covered by many including B.B. King, but this is the Chess version of Little Walter Jacobs. Check out the original recording, it's great. This tune has a great arrangement. The guitars copy the Chicago sound and Keith has some of his most effective blues playing ever, a great emulation of Jimmy Dawkins and hard to do, even today! The hand damping triple time shuffle in the second half of the tune by Brian Jones adds so much and its not in the original. Very creative, and no effects!<br /><br />Of course one who loves Blues has to comment of the Blues Harmonica of both Brian Jones and Mick Jagger. Again, not electricified, but played into the studio mike with reverb, very haunting. The Stones have always been underrated as harpists, but they did much to promote the Chicago Blues Harp. Case in point, \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\" (the address of the Chess Studios)-just super. Great harp playing and this version includes Keith's snappy guitar solo not in the original US release. And, of course, we have to also mention Keith's top solo ever (to me!) on \\"It's All Over Now\\" it's Chuck Berry with speed and soul!!!<br /><br />\\"Empty Heart\\", written, or collaborated with, Phil Spector, is usually described as filler. But I love it and it was a prelude to the Bo Diddley recognition they would do on the \\"Now\\" LP. The Vibrato guitar without much singing is almost like a 1960s dance track. \\"Time Is On My Side\\" (this is the \\"organ intro\\" version released in the U.S. first, I think this is the better one too!), another massive hit from this period, was another attempt by the Stones to cover US R&B Soul tunes. In this case the tune had been a hit for the great Irma Thomas. I always had a lot of respect for Mick Jagger to even attempt to cover tunes by Solomon Burke, The Drifters (Under the Boardwalk) and The Falcons with Wilson Pickett (If You Need Me). That takes guts and they got away with it because most of the originals were not known to the mainstream population at the time. He did go too far when he did \\"My Girl\\" later on after it had already been a No. 1 hit.<br /><br />\\"Congratulations\\" was an attempt to write a period Pop Tune. Its chord progression was right out of the 1950s-early 60s doowop era (something like the \\"Bristol Stomp!\\"). However the Stones put their own bluesy vocals into it and the\\"dirt\\" of the Chess Studios. \\"Grown Up Wrong\\" is another writing attempt. This tune clearly pays hommage to Elmore James with its slide riff. However, it is weak and much too repetitive. I used to skip it when I played the LP. This final tune \\"Suzie-Q\\" is their cover of Dale Hawkin's classic with the great James Burton riff. Again, it sounds like they ran out of studio time, or they didin't have their soul in it. And it's too short. Interesting, on this tune Keith's playing outshines Mick's singing. The final guitar solo has quite a spark and that's how we fade out in this set.<br /><br />This is a great CD. It does have a few weak tunes on it and some early attempts at songwriting which are variable. However, the strong tunes are really strong and still sound great today.<br />Get this CD and revisit the onset of the \\"White Blues Revival\\" of the early 1960s!s another writing attempt.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me for years before I finally watched it.  I just don't like prison movies, and no matter what anyone told me, I couldn't believe that it wouldn't be a depressing story.  Of course when I finally checked it out I discovered that it is indeed very uplifting and inspiring.  Being focused on triumph of the human spirit, of course there is going to be heavy-duty adversity and plenty of sadness along the way, but it is by no means a depressing movie.  I've watched it numerous times now, so I recommend it highly as a movie worth watching and owning.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Don't ever count Madonna out.  After her disappointing \\"American Life\\" cd, I'm sure many people were ready to believe that the iconic scandal maker was finally beginning that downward spiral into the \\"so 5 minutes ago\\" crowd of former kings and queens of pop.  Not so with Ms. Ritchie!  Returning to the genre of music that made her famous, Madonna is giving her fans what they have been clamouring for---a reason to dance!<br /><br />Starting off the set with \\"Hung Up\\", perhaps the strongest single of the cd, Madonna revs us up for the dance grooves that she will be spinning our way.  \\"Hung Up\\" with its infectious ABBA sample (Gimme, Gimme, Gimme) gets into your head and makes you want to jump up and dance across the floor.<br /><br />Other songs of note is \\"Issac\\", which received criticism for religious blasphemy (which is ridiculous), is actually one of my favorite songs on the cd.  Also, bound to become a favorite of die hard New Yorkers is the song, \\"I Love New York\\" in which Madonna disses her new hometown, London, in comparison with her old city of residence.<br /><br />While I don't think this cd is as good as \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Music\\", I do think Madonna has returned to her greatest strength---good dance music.  Welcome back, Madonna, and here's hoping that in the future, you give us more of the same!
6305212112|5.0|This is one of the rare movies that actually does justice to the book it was based on.  I thought Fried Green Tomatoes was tremendously uplifing and extremely funny, but you might find you'll shed a tear or two in places also.  I liked the messages regarding taking charge of your life when things aren't how you'd like them to be, and being yourself no matter how wacky or different that may make you seem to others.  No question that this is a movie the whole family can enjoy.  I recommend it to absolutely anyone.
B000066JES|4.0|Some call it \\"Cheese\\" metal, others \\"POWER\\" metal.  I call it \\"Barbarian metal\\".  Kind of combines both ideas.  This cd is great for these songs alone: <br /> <br />1. Call to Arms: 4/5 Great intro song.  \\"To no man shall I kneel and blood is upon my steel\\".  Urge to kill rising, rising.  It only gets better with.... <br />(Skip the next few songs) <br />2. Swords in the Wind: 10/5  - The most beautiful and inspirational and totally KICK ASS manowar song ever!  Starts as a soft ballad and finishes with power.  Makes me wish I had long hair, a beard, iron underwear and a giant axe. Is there a church of Odin around?  This and Warriors of the world make the cd worth it.  Urge to kill, still rising. <br /> <br />3. Warriors of the World: 5/5 Powerful riff and very catchy.  Goes great following \\"Swords in the Wind\\" <br />- By this time you're ready to take on the Roman Empire <br /> <br />4. Hand of Doom: 3/5 Pretty cool song but not the best.  Coming down off the high now.  By the time you hear it you've already got the manowar idea so it's getting a little tired. <br /> <br />The rest of the cd is pretty lame.  Urge to kill, gone.   <br />Who are we fighting again?  The non-Barbarian metal bands?   <br /> <br />A fun listen though.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|On the basis of the hilarious characters alone, this movie should not be missed.  Many of the lines like \\"flippin' sweet,\\" \\"dang!\\" and \\"Pedro offers you his protection,\\" are likely to stick with you and make you smile long after you see it.  And while these things don't look so funny here in print, their delivery in the film is truly awesome and outrageous.  Napoleon and Pedro are great as underdog heros, and I absolutely loved Napoleon's brother and head-case of an uncle who was living in 1983.  This is probably the most creatively bizarre film I've seen in several years, and I recommend it to anyone.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I think this movie was wonderful it is sad that if it is really true I will be 75 years old in 2025 when it is released and I don't think I will have much interest at that point. I can't understand why Amazon  put the date down if they are realeasing that far in the futrure. It is true that Walmart is selling it by Christmas. This is really quite confusing.
B0007P3582|2.0|Keep in my mind that no one has ever claimed that 50 was a great lyricist, let alone an average one. Nevertheless he WILL sell, regardless of the quality, and this album proves that point emphatically. I'm not a 50 hater, it's just that he doesn't make good music; if you have any sense you should know that. The fact that 50 is backed by stellar producers, em and dre, and a good marketing department, will always keep 50 on top of the sales charts. <br /> <br />As for \\"The Massacre\\", all you need to know is that for the most part the production is very good but as usual 50's lyrics are anything but good or even adequate. This is pop-rap at it's finest though, and if you're into this sort of thing you may in fact like the album.  <br /> <br />The only true highlight of the album is \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\", where 50 shows a bit of creativity and raps from the point of view of the drug crack. It's a very creative concept; not sure if it was ghostwritten or not. There are also a few incredible beats one the album, particularly \\"Ski Mask Way\\" and \\"I Don't Need Em.\\" 50's lyricism doesn't do much for either though. These 3 are probably the best tracks on the album. The rest is either mysoginistic garbage or tired, played out to death cash, money and guns stuff. One particularly terrible track is \\"Get in My Car.\\" <br /> <br />Bottom line this album pretty much blows aside from the nice production. If you want some real hip hop go purchase a Common album, or Talib Kweli, or Dead Prez or something. <br /> <br />On a side note, 50's former associate The Game dropped a very nice album \\"The Documentary\\" earlier this year. Good production AND lyrics on that one, for the most part.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Thank goodness Madonna found herself.I have loved her the moment <br />the singles from Madonna (first album)hit the airwaves.I could not get enough of this woman.Then we get to Ray of light and Music,she was throwing in some techno but i'm more of a house music lover.If I wanna dance I wanna dance not bounce to some obnoxious techno beat.I would not even consider buying American Life.Then, a glimmer of hope,reto Madonna.Yes!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!! <br />The cd version of hung up is the best and should have been released as the single version.Get together and Sorry are Awesome!!!!! Jump is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!! I just hit repeat and dance my *** off on that one.Those of us who grew up in the 80's will here so much on this cd,it is like a time machine.Hit 1983 please!!!!!!!!
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was undeniably horrible. This is a movie that should have never even been thaught about let alone scripted and followed threw. I hate to say this but the original Willy Wonkay and the Chocolate Factory actually had better affects than this movie could have even thaught of. I love Jonny Depp as an actor, but after this I question is mental stability. Jean Wilder by far makes the best Willy Wonka and will never be outdone by the likes of Jonny Depp. You can not understand the Oompa Loompas songs let alone enjoy when you grew up with the original movie. The only thing I actually liked about the movie was the fact that they gave a little insight to what was going on and what made Willy Wonka who he was, but even that got a little rediculous. In my opinion, by far the worst remake we have ever seen.

B000957O82|5.0|What can you say about Will Smith? He can do it all. He can fight aliens, robots, true love, and still always bring his own identity to the big screen. If there was ever a more diverse actor, I'm not sure who it is. He is absolutely fabulous. This movie was a true mix of emotions. You can watch Will as he replays what so many of us have been threw, putting up the invisible wall so we never get hurt again. But then there is always that one person that will bust it down. This movie has a unique twist on comedy, love, and the never ending search for something you feel is out of reach. And so many of us can relate to this movie it was just fabulously plotted, well scripted, and done perfectly. By far I feel it is Will Smith's best work yet. The only thing I wish they would have done was include Tim McGraw's hit song, \\"My Best Friend\\".
0679422714|4.0|From what other reviewers have said, there has been mixed responses regarding \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\". Since reading it, I have come down on the middle ground between two seeming extremes. It was a good read, and it seems to present it's case well, though with some qualifying reservations.<br /><br />Overall, the credibility of the research is mostly quite good, with a good range of sources including writings from some of the key figures, such as German Communist Otto Braun. While it is preferable to utilise written records, in some cases eye-witness accounts are just as valuable. Despite the acceptance of eye-witness accounts, Chang and Halliday often mention people but with no names, and then quote them. This I find suspicious.<br /><br />While the bibliography is extensive, the almost complete lack of foot notes is something of an issue with me. This makes it much harder to check the sources cited, and check whether quotes and information has been used accurately. Had Chang and Halliday supplied detailed and specifically attributed footnotes, it could have helped them bolster their use of eye witness accounts and give some cross-referencing. There is a section of detailed endnotes, arranged by page number, which is something, at least.<br /><br />The book was written as a type of polemic work against the myth of Mao. In this way, it really should come as no surprise that Mao is lambasted thoroughly and completely. While it may be true he was a cynical manipulator, (Stalin, Chiang Kai-shek and company were really no different when it came to power), I find it hard to maintain that Mao did not have one single redeeming quality, other than finding good women to marry his make friends. In this sense, the book is very much one-sided and does not deal with Mao all that fairly.<br /><br />Despite having some reservations about it, I do not think calling it \\"revisionist\\" is a point of objection, but could be good thing. I would reccomend the book, but with the note that one should look at other sources as well, before writing Mao off as a complete monster, though being responsible for 70 million deaths would certainly qualify him. Certainly read \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\", but treat it with caution and check other authors before you make solid judgements on Mao.s as well, before writing Mao off as a complete monster, though being responsible for 70 million deaths would certainly qualify him.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|OMG!!!  What are you waiting for?  If you have yet to buy Confessions on a Dance Floor, then you have waited too long.  This album is FABULOUS.  While it is not as introspective as the Ray of Light album, it definitely offers new beats from a classic dance-floor diva.  She has once again redefined what we dance to.  Ya gotta love her...if not, then you at least have to own this album.  Get your credit card out...this is a MUST BUY.
B000BGH22W|2.0|I think that John Williams should have written the Goblet of Fire soundtrack. I was disappointed after listening to Patrick Doyle's soundtrack. It lacks substance and that Harry Potter magical quality that John Williams has always given us. After all, John Williams is a musical genus.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I love this album. From songs like \\"Baby, One More Time\\" to \\"Toxic\\", just great! <br /> <br />I must point out Britney is not in her early or mid 30s like sone (idiotic) reviewers have said, she's still 24. Neither is she \\"fading out\\", she is still a big star around the world and this album shows why (great music, great showbiz/sexy image). <br /> <br />If you like great pop music, then get this!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|when i first saw this film back in the early 90's, i saw something great in it, and so when it was released for the first time on video cassette, i snapped it up pretty fast. Well time has taken it's toll on this vhs now, and the picture is unbalanced, grainy, and has white lines that appear every so often. seeing this beloved film in such sad shape was depressing. <br /> <br />when i purchased the new platinum dvd, I was amazed. The colors, characters, and unforgettable music leapt out of the screen and it was like looking through a window the picture was so clear, and the colors were vibrant. one would hardly believe after watching this crisp new version that the film was first realeased in 1937
B0006L16N8|2.0|At first I was biased about X&Y, because its Coldplay, a band whose first two albums I love. I love the music on Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head for its simplicity, integrity, the catchy sometimes overwhelmingly beautiful songs, and Chris Martins singing them... At first I also liked their new album X&Y, but it didnt last long. <br /> <br />What I dislike about X&Y mostly, is the dominating electric guitar. Square One, Fix You, Talk, Low, and The Hardest Part have the exact same bland use of the electric guitar, and other use of the electric guitar is (too) much like U2. Coldplay have dumped their acoustic guitar sound that was on both of their last 2 albums (the tracks A Message, Fix You (both still featuring electric guitar) and 'Til Kingdom Come being the exceptions). Where's the guitar that countered Chris Martins voice beautifully, the one that gives these various warm melodies on Parachutes? And where are the honest, piano based songs, like Clocks on AROBTTH?  <br />Alot of X&Y's lacks have to do with the production (done by Danton Supple and Ken Nelson who produced 3 tracks, while AROBTTH's production was done completely by Ken Nelson). Alot of songs, like Talk, The Hardest Part, White Shadows and Low, have boring, almost beatbox-like beats. On alot of songs the drums dont play the part they had on A Rush Of Blood To The Head, one that gave the songs strength. At their climax, alot of songs on X&Y have high strings and synthesizer sounds on the background, combined with bad equalization giving it a bland sound. This is done so by the producer. <br />But the lack of diversity is something the bandmembers of Coldplay are accountable for. The only diversity on the album is the difference between the loud songs and the ballads. This makes the album feel like a car that keeps hitting the breaks. The 'acceleration' and structure of alot of the songs individually is too poor to make you want to listen to the songs again and again, as well. This is the case with What If, for example. It starts up too slowly, and is pretty unrewarding at the end being much like all the other songs: again the bored electric guitar, the rather grotesque than beautifully overwhelming sound, and Chris Martin singing high notes. This brings me to the point that Chris Martins simple lyrics are hardly elegant anymore.  <br />Theyre like the lyrics on The World Turned Upside Down, the b-side of the Fix You maxi-single: ''You and me / The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea / 365 Degrees / I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece.'' This song sounds bland and alike a Bloc Party track, and Chris Martin also sings a bit like Kele Okereke on it. As he's a Bloc Party fan, thats obviously not per chance... But this song is not on the X&Y album itself so I cant really use that as an argument. But on X&Y itself, the lyrics arent much better. On Parachutes it was integrity, on X&Y it is nearly humiliating... <br />But even not examining every little thing on X&Y one by one, as a whole the album is uninspired, and bores soon. <br /> <br />At some points you can still feel it is the Coldplay of the last two albums, because although theyve taken one tune from Kraftwerk (on Talk), they still know what is a good melody. And at some points on the album, you want to sing together with Chris Martin just like you wanted on AROBTTH. Some of the songs are actually good and enjoyable, as a whole! <br /> <br />Coldplay wanted to have the biggest sound they could produce on X&Y, and they wanted something different from what they had done before... They succeeded in the last thing, because of the dominating electric guitar and influences of other bands than the ones they were influenced by before, but this album lacks the quality and diversity A Rush Of Blood To The Head had.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I stumbled onto this series after seeing the Serenity movie. I was so blown away at the theater, that I immediately came home and ordered the complete series on Amazon.  <br />I have since watched each episode multiple time. The space western approach to the future seems more realistic than a \\"Star Trek\\" future. <br />The series also pokes at current events and how big government hits the little guy. <br />Well done and well thought out.
B0002KPIQY|3.0|Gia Carangi was a party animal!  She lived wild and died young.  The only person that could have taken this role was Angelina.  She's got the look as a actress and a model.  This film was Angie's coming out party.  Her performance as the legendary model showed the world what the future holds for her.  An Emmy and an Oscar later, Angelina is on top of the entertainment world.  Esquire Magazine named her the \\"Sexiest Woman Alive\\" and I agree with them 100 percent!<br /><br />As a movie, it does have some flaws.  It's talky and rather long.  Aside from that, Jolie's groundbreaking performance is enough to recommend this made for cable film.
B0002IQHY8|3.0|It was perhaps inevitable that Alan Parsons would move into electronica -- so inevitable that perhaps he arrived here too late. In some ways, Alan Parsons is one of the key links between progressive rock (he produced some of Pink Floyd's best work) and electronica (no accident that The Crystal Method pays homage to his influence by walking through this album).  This collection works, it is worth the price if you are an Alan Parsons Project fan.  I don't know if it is a disappointment, because I'm not sure Alan Parsons has ever had a \\"great\\" album (although \\"I, Robot\\" comes close), but this album is certainly not unworthy of his catalog of music. <br />

No damages were set. <br /> <br />Madonna can appeal the ruling. A call to the singer's New York-based publicist was not immediately returned.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|This album is the most original and exciting classical CD release of the year! I love what Cecilia has done with this undiscovered music, she has more energy and brilliance than all other opera stars combined. I am actually glad she has stopped doing all this \\"regular\\" opera material, I don't need to hear any more Rossini and Mozart. Actually, by the end of 2006 which is Mozart anniversary year, we will all be really sick of Mozart... Based on this Opera Proibita album, I would like to hear ten more hours of early Handel and Caldara.  I wish other artists would leave standard repertoire behind and started singing this great music. Of course, not many people can actually sing these pieces, written for the great castrati, and Cecilia is one of the very few who can sing them with such bravura. The fast, acrobatic arias are dazzling and the slow arias are so beautiful. Vanne Pentita A Piangere is a real gem, and if it wasn't for Cecilia we would never hear it! This aria also displays her messa di voce, and ravishing pianissimo, they are to die for. Castrati were not famous for their upper range, and not required to have high notes as we know them today but I like the way Cecilia spices up these arias with few stratospheric high notes,they are totally brillianr and would make many sopranos green with envy, but she uses them with great taste.  I think the cover of this album is very witty, a tribute to that famous scene in Fellini's film classic. Indeed, in each aria Cecilia gives a us a little encapsulated movie scene. She is so good at making the text come alive, using many colors of her voice to highlight the effect. Her diction is perfect, but in case your Italian is little rusty, all the texts and translations are included. When you read them, you will understand how much feeling Cecilia puts into these mini dramas. Just listen to the way she sings this one word, \\"Moro, moro...\\" in Caldo Sangue.  There will always be detractors who will talk nonsense about her \\"deficient\\" technique, I understand they are jealous of Cecilia's talent, the little people. For the rest of us, there's always the joy of hearing Cecilia tear into \\"All'arme Si Accesi Guerrieri\\", she is at war with bland, insipid music! Thank God we have our Cecilia to remind us that music can be exciting and exhilarating. I love all these stories how people who only listen to rock music heard Cecilia on the radio and went to buy this CD. You should buy ten copies of it and give them to your relatives, I don't think they will hear any yelps in her fioritura, I know many of my friends will be getting this album from Santa this year. Mille Grazie to Cecilia for bringing us this great music!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I'm going to have to agree with T. Nakajima on this movie. This is one of the best kung fu movies, ever. If you are a Jackie Chan fan like myself and like comedy in your kung fu, but you still enjoy Jet Li, Ekin Cheng, and Chow Yun Fat fliks with powerful fight scenes and crazy flying around, then this is right up your alley. But, don't expect this to be Kung-Pow! It's funny without being overly goofy and stupid about it. It helps to understand the eastern sense of corny humor sometimes too. There's some pretty good CG as in Shaolin Soccer, and Chow makes good use of the CG even in sight gags. But, there's good romance to this story as well, and overall you'll be pleased by the time it ends.  <br /> <br />Another point of note. If you're going to read reviews by people who have problems paying for their DVDs, or compare kung fu flicks to unrelated western fish-out-of-water comedies, or for some reason get frustrated reading subtitles and think that actors in Hong Kong films are somehow speaking Japanese instead of Chinese, then be my guest. Otherwise, take it from me, I'm a Hong Kong and Japanese film fan, and this one is going right next to Shanghai Noon, Gorgeous, and The Duel.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Those people who love the pounding rhythms of high energy, the music of the gay underground in the mid-80s, will not be disappointed by Madonna's new musical offering. <br />The first track 'Hung Up' is fabulous, with its Abba sampling and a hint of Native Love by Divine. Just makes you want to dance and dance. The rest of the album is equally good, especially 'Forbidden Love'. Is it Madonna's best-ever album? I don't know, but any fan of dance music should make a place for this album in their collection.  <br />

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Come on - it's a Madonna CD! What did you expect?
B000BO0LLS|4.0|as said by other reviewer:<br /><br />The only thing more pathetic than Mariah Carey herself is her stupid \\"lambs\\" who have to keep posting 1-star reviews of Madonna's new cd over and over again. These are the same 4 children who must be around 12 years old because they can't even spell. And looking at the reviews (if you can call them that) you can tell they haven't even listened to Confessions on a Dance Floor. What's wrong? Are you that threatened by Madonna's talent that you have to try to sabotage her career? (Not that it will work) Or maybe you just don't have any real confidence in Mariah's talents that is why you need to constantly trash other artists.<br /><br />The fact is I used to be a big fan of both Mariah and Madonna. But where Madonna is a true talent, someone innovative and unique who is not a afraid to take chances (what a real artist is all about) Mariah is predictable and her music is commercial crap. And her talent (or lack of) is obvious now. I bought The Emancipation of Mimi when it first came out because i liked It's Like that and had hope for this cd after her last two sucked. But the only good songs on it were It's Like That, We Belong Together, Stay the Night and Mine Again. The rest are generic crap and after listening to it a couple of times i have now tossed it aside in my cd pile where it has been collecting dust ever since. Her voice used to be beautiful, full of soul and passion. Check out Vision Of Love and Emotions, and compare that to anything she has done recently. But now she has lost her voice. She goes from a faint whisper to a shriek like she is trying too hard to prove something. The point is that she isn't the talent she used to be. Her song writing is a joke now too. What happened to songs like Make it Happen, Hero, Anytime You need a Friend and Butterfly? These were real songs with real messages and meaning in them. Now we get songs with references to Bacardi, Louis Vuitton and her Benz and all the money she makes. Why? Because Mariah is shallow and so is her music. She can't write anymore..apparently she and Jermaine Dupri have hit the marajuana one too many times.<br /><br />So why the re-release?<br /><br />So she can suck more money out of her fans who will buy anything. And because she knows her music isn't that good anymore. That is why she basically re-recorded We Belong Together as Don't Forget about Us and released it as a single instead of releasing one of the other songs as a single and saving these \\"new\\" songs for a remix album or ep . Shake It Off was generic r+b that anyone could've released from Ashanti to Ciara. Nothing special about it. The only reason it did so well is because it was released immediately after the success of We Belong Together and because American radio is tired, playing nothing but the same generic hip hop and r+b crap over and over again. Unlike other countries around the world where all types of music are promoted and appreciated.<br /><br />Mariah does not care about her fans..she refers to you as lambs...how degrading is that? But what do you expect from someone who is so full of herself. Whose ego now heavily outweighs her talent. I saw her on Ellen's talkshow yesterday. She acted like she was so much better than everyone else, prancing out looking like a slut in clothes that were too tight for her and her face looking chubby and puffy.<br /><br />I refuse to buy the same cd over again when i didn't like it that much the first time around. Especially to support a woman who is arrogant and whose ego is now as big as her silicone implants. So if you pathetic lambs want to post bad reviews for Madonna go ahead. People are going to buy what they want based on their own tastes anyway. Not because some stupid 10 year old keeps posting bad reviews over and over again. If you want to write a real review for Madonna, at least listen to her music first and make a real judgement based on that. And when you are doing that i will be listening to Confessions on a Dance Floor..which after only being released four days ago I have listened to many more times than Mariah's boring lastest release. LONG LIVE THE REAL QUEEN OF POP AND DANCE MUSIC....MADONNA!!!<br /><br />_______________________________________________________<br /><br />Now this my point of view:<br /><br />I do like Mariah, her voice is beautiful, but her fans and their attitude are the worst, believe it or not, i'm happy that she's back in the charts, but as Amazon.com says in the oficial review of Madonna's new album:<br /><br />On Confessions of a Dance Floor, Madonna, the most popular and significant female artist in pop music, returns unapologetically to her roots.

B0009MA8V0|1.0|I'm going to be straight up honest with ya'll. American Idiot was the worse crap I've ever heard. They're like Ozzy Osbourne or the KISS group. A bunch of gothic losers who can't sing at all.  <br />Why would they call themselves American Idiot? is that funny? What's the deal with these white males who dress gothic? Good Charlotte is wack!

B00070QXL8|2.0|Same story, second verse. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason stars Renee Zellweger in her reprisal of the chunky, outspoken, good-hearted Jones. For several reasons, I thought this movie was a hit and miss endeavor. First of all, I couldn't understand why Jones was whining about boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) never fighting for her, considering he beat Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) to a pulp for her in the LAST movie. (Which incidentally, was only four weeks before the second movie begins. Apparently, fighting for Jones at least once a month is required.)<br /><br />Secondly, some quite preposterous plot turns (Being thrown in a Thai prison? That's a bit much for even my flexible suspension of disbelief.) made the whole movie pretty hard to swallow. Zellweger descends into pure slapstick, and the script takes every opportunity to make jokes at Jones' expense.<br /><br />The movie was okay, but I don't expect that another film following the escapades of Jones will be worth watching unless the formula is changed enough to allow for some relief.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This movie sucked a big one! Horrible from start to finish. If you can't do it justice, leave the sequels alone!
B00005JO1P|5.0|I cannot believe how good this movie was! I am a huge Johnny Cash fan, as well as a huge fan of bio-pics, and I have been anxiously awaiting this movie for over a year. That having been said, I was really worried that, as much as I had been looking forward to it, I would be disappointed when I finally got to see it. NOT THE CASE! As a matter of fact the movie exceeded my expectations! <br />  Joaquin Pheonix does a better job than I would have ever imagined anyone could do at playing Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon also does an excellent job, and it goes on down the line, I was also very impressed with the supporting cast. <br />  All in all, I can't say enough good things about this movie. I will be going to see it again while it's still in theatres! Even if you're not a country music fan or a Johnny Cash fan, I truly believe that you would enjoy this movie! It's just an all around great picture, I foresee Oscar nominations!
B00005Y228|1.0|Is this woman for real....or perhaps I should ask.....are her fans and followers for real.  I cannot believe that a disturbingly vast majority of people in today's Australia actually claim that this middle aged female joke has talent, charm and sex appeal....and after hearing the annoying screaching vocals accompanied by bland and unthoughtful electronic bleeps and bips....what a ridiculous woman you really are.  Perhaps this woman is the perfect metaphor for a country (Australia) that appears to dwell in everything that is derivative.  Minogue, please, the world currently has a great pop artist by the name of Madonna....and she is laughing at your embarrassing and cheap little immitations.  Please do not release anymore of this revolting and unthankful rubbish...however, this request may perhaps never manifest itself because you are like crab grass.....never really quelled and always cropping up secretly and annoyingly in another spot.  Give it up you silly woman.  A revolting album.
B000002AZ8|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />A common complaint fans often have against their favorite band is that \\"the early stuff is great, but then they went commercial/sold out.\\" No such complaint could ever be made against Pearl Jam. Quite the opposite; while Pearl Jam's early albums, most notably \\"Ten\\" (1991) and \\"Vs.\\" (1993) were quite radio friendly, their music became more and more obscure and arty as the band went on. With the exception of the band's straight-forward fifth album \\"Yield,\\" (1998) most of Pearl Jam's work from the mid-90s up has been far less assessable than their first two albums. In this sense, Pearl Jam are like the anti-sellouts. Not caring how well an album is perceived, the band has always had the integrity to follow its artistic vision.<br /><br />In some respects, Pearl Jam's third album \\"Vitalogy\\" (1994) represents the end of an era. \\"Vitalogy\\" was the last Pearl Jam album to enjoy multi-platinum success and spawn numerous singles that dominated the radio. \\"Vitalogy\\" was sort of the last Pearl Jam album that \\"everybody\\" had to buy. While Pearl Jam's next two albums achieved platinum status, by the mid-to-late 90s, their reign at the top was over. While the faithful have stood by the band over the years, most of Pearl Jam's fickle audience that so loved \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.,\\" moved on to Phish, Matchbox 20, and the Dave Mathews Band as the 90s progressed. In addition, 1994 was really the last year of the grunge era. While the Seattle movement had briefly brought authenticity back into rock in the early 90s, by 1995, with the likes of Bush and Seven Mary 3, it was back to corporate pap as usual, in the era known as post-grunge. In 1994, with the death of Cobain, in the eyes and ears of the fickle mainstream, grunge breathed its last breath. \\"Vitalogy\\" was one of the last albums from the grunge movement to enjoy a healthy reign at the top.<br /><br />While Pearl Jam's debut \\"Ten\\" has been pigeonholed as \\"grunge,\\" it is actually one of the least grunge sounding albums in Pearl Jam's catalogue. \\"Ten,\\" with its classic rock trimmings and finely crafted songs, doesn't have the distorted guitars, feedback, intense drumming, or the \\"fuzz\\" associated with the grunge sound. By contrast, \\"Vs.\\" and \\"Vitalogy\\" are far more grunge sounding than the debut.<br /><br />Pearl Jam's second album \\"Vs\\" was a 180 degree turn from the debut \\"Ten.\\" Compared to \\"Ten,\\" \\"Vs\\" sounds far less polished; more stripped down, and has more of a live feel. \\"Vitalogy\\" takes the sound of \\"Vs.\\" to the next level and sounds even looser, and more stripped down. But while virtually every song on \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" was a potential radio single, many of the songs on \\"Vitalogy are just flat out-there. Lyrically, the album is also more vague and the songs harder to decipher.<br /><br />In short, of the first three albums, \\"Vitalogy\\" is the most grunge-sounding, the least commercial and by far the most abstract.<br /><br />But none of this is meant as criticism against the album, because as loose as \\"Vitalogy\\" is, everything works.  There's a fine line between having an album that's avant-garde and having one that's just a mess; luckily, \\"Vitalogy\\" never crosses that line. Pearl Jam knew what they were doing and created a rather chaotic, yet cohesive collection of songs.<br /><br />The opening full-throttle \\"Last Exit,\\" which sounds like the band is just working out a song at a jam, immediately lets the listener know what's in store. Brash as the song is, it has melody and is fully captivating. \\"Spin the Back Circle,\\" which sounds like Led Zeppelin meets the Sex Pistols, shows Pearl Jam's  intense side. \\"Not for you\\" starts out slowly, giving the listener a temporary reprieve, but soon goes into full-attack-mode. An underrated song, this features a really cool solo by Mike McCready. The album slows down a notch for the sluggish \\"Tremor Christ,\\" which offers an interesting contrast between its lethargic pace and Eddie Vedder's preacher-like delivery. The semi-acoustic \\"Nothingman,\\" which tells the story of a wasted life, of a man that \\"could have been something\\" is both harrowing and beautiful. The free-flowing \\"whipping\\" sounds like a jam, but with structure and melody, and works for the overall flow of the album. The bizarre \\"Pry to\\" is just a minute of filler, but is atmospheric and is a good transaction to the next song. The opening chords of \\"Corduroy\\" are instantly memorable to anyone that listened to the radio back in '94. Loose, intense, stripped-down and melodic, this is Pearl Jam at their best. An ode to the dangers of conformity, \\"Bugs,\\" which Vedder speaks of being besieged by bugs over the repetitive sounds of an accordion, is just flat out bizarre. While I usually skip over this track when I have \\"Vitalogy\\" in my discman, \\"Bugs\\" adds a little something out of the ordinary to the album and its inclusion is warranted. The good-but-not-great, off-center punkish \\"Satan's Bed\\" keeps up the momentum. Another PJ classic, the sensitive \\"Better Man\\" tells of the pain of having to settle. Much like \\"Bugs,\\" I usually skip over the off-center instrumental \\"Aye Davanita,\\" but it's still an interesting and cool track which adds flavor to the album. The death of fellow Seattle rock star Kurt Cobain no doubt impacted the band, as they pay tribute with \\"Immorality.\\" The song doesn't attempt to idolize or make Cobain out to be a martyr or infallible, but rather acts as a beautiful tribute that tries to explain the tragic suicide. The song depicts Cobain (although not by name) to be a deeply troubled man, seeking solace and a release from pain. The avant-garde, bohemian-like closing \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, that's me,\\" is a bizarre, semi-instrumental with sound bytes. It's a bit like \\"Revolution #9\\" from the Beatles self-titled \\"White\\" (1968) album. I've listened to this song for eleven years, as of this writing, and I'm still not sure whether it's high-art, or just plain pretentious. Either way, it's a cool non-song that I enjoy.<br /><br />The packaging of the album is also really cool. The mini-book, filled with photos, drawings, and various odds-and-ends, done in the style of the 19th Century, is quite cool. It's sort of a return to the more personal and artistic days of the vinyl, as opposed to the cold and lifeless age of CDs.<br /><br />Because of the brashness, off-centeredness, and bizarre non-song tracks, \\"Vitalogy\\" is not the best place to start if you want to get into Pearl Jam. New listeners are advised to buy \\"Ten,\\" \\"Vs.\\" or the \\"Rearview Mirror-best of\\" (2004) before they pick up \\"Vitalogy\\" or subsequent albums.

B00005JOGU|4.0|I wish I had known more about the life of Truman Capote before going to see this movie. All I knew was that he was a well-known writer, most acclaimed for his \\"non-fiction\\" novel \\"In Cold Blood.\\" I had expected this movie to be a, more or less, sympathetic portrayal of Capote and how he had come to write about some murders in Kansas. Wow, was I ever wrong. <br /> <br />What I discovered instead was that Capote was a boozing, narcissistic liar who placed his own literary glory before the life of another man, the murderer Perry Smith, that he claimed to deeply care about. This decay of Capote's soul was depicted most clearly towards the movie's end, as he waited anxiously for Smith to be executed so he could finish his book. His friend Harper Lee tried to remain a voice of conscience for Capote. But he was so jealous of Lee's own literary success with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" that he ignored her until the very end, when he did finally accept Perry Smith's request to attend the execution. I think Capote's character can best be summed up by a comment he made to Harper Lee earlier in the movie. Capote stated that he felt close to Smith because \\"it was like we were from the same family, only he went out the back door while I went out the front.\\" The truth is that, by the end, Capote had chosen to go out the back door himself.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It takes one hell of a great album for me to bother writing a review that's just going to be lost among 500 or 1000 others.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what gets released as singles here because, honestly, almost anything on the CD could be a hit. It seems like any artist as popular as Madonna gets either 1 or 5 stars from every reviewer, every time they release a new album, due mostly to their persona. I hate to seem like I'm falling into that trend, but I can't give this album anything less than 5 stars. There's just no reason that this shouldn't be her most popular album.<br /><br />First, when has Madonna ever stayed the same from one album to the next? Sure, there are similarities between Music & American Life, and between True Blue & Like a Prayer, but repetition is just not her thing. So why shouldn't this album have a disco feel to it? I can't even really call it disco, because, like everything else Madonna does, it's her (unique) version of a style. I can hear bits of \\"Into the Groove\\" \\"Skin\\" \\"'Til Death Do Us Part\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" all over this disc & still say  there's nothing repetitous about any of it.<br /><br />I think anyone who gave this album 1 star b/c Madonna's \\"lost it\\" or any one of the other lame, unsupportable slaps I've read here needs a reality check: this isn't 1986, \\"Open Your Heart\\" has already had its day, tastes have changed. Even if Madonna HAD just recorded more updated soundalikes of her older hits, even the most hardcore fans wuold still find something to complain about.<br /><br />I became a fan of hers when the Ray of Light album came out. I get chills when I hear \\"La Isla Bonita\\" or \\"Frozen\\".

6304119046|5.0|Citizen Kane is often said to be the greatest film ever.  I'd like to go further and propose that it's the greatest work of art of the twentieth century.  Here's why: <br /> <br />1) Film was the most dynamic and robust art form of the century.  Classical music, the traditional visual arts, and literature all entered an overly self-conscious, modernist phase.  Only film had the freshness and, yes, the vulgar vitality of such great nineteenth-century forms as opera and the novel.  It was, in short, the great popular art form.  And Citizen Kane was the best of the lot, the film of films. <br /> <br />2) For better or worse, it was \\"the American century.\\"  And what work of art goes more to the heart of American culture than Citizen Kane, with its brilliant exposition of class, politics, business, and media? <br /> <br />3) Film is the great synthetic art, something like what Wagner dreamed of creating.  Literature, theater, the visual arts, and music all come together--and no film better exemplifies all the possibilities of this synthesis than Kane, with its great sceenplay, cast, sets, and score by Bernard Herrmann. <br />
0385338686|5.0|While non of the so called 'Chick Lit' books are true to life masterpieces, some are more amusing than others, and Sophie Kinsella's were always some of my favorites - whether they were part of the Shopaholic series, or a stand alone book.<br /><br />Samantha Sweeting, a 29 years old lawyer from the most prestigious office in London, is about to become a partner in her firm. For her, this is the grand prize for everything she's given up in the past years: her spare time, normal relationships (even though she's perfected the 6 minutes sex with her ex who also happened to be a lawyer), and even normal birthdays (because she, her mom, or her brother are usually too busy to attend). Health food for Samantha s take out Chinese (after all, Chinese people are renowned for their healthy food, right) and pizza (ditto for the Italians).<br /><br />On the day she is about to become partner, Samantha clears her desk and find a ddocument that shws she had made a huge, 5 million pound mistake even a novice would have a hard time making. Instead of facing the consequences, Samantha just leaves the office, gets on a train, and somehow ends up in the country. When she knocks on a door of a house looking for a cup of water for her headache, the combination of her numbness and her pride makes her take a job as a housekeeper, even though she knows nothing about housework and even less about gourmet cooking.
B0002O7XVI|4.0|Tess of the D'Urbervilles represents one of the essential novels of the Victorian era. Roman Polanski's version of Thomas Hardy's novel is exquisite in its depiction of the mood that I believe this type of work wants to create. Tess, for all her weaknesses, does represent a tragic heroine.  Some may argue that Polanski's Tess is a bit weak, but I don't think they are truly giving Natasha Kinski credit for creating a sensitive and innocent Tess.   <br /> <br />Tess goes to the D'Urberville estate in the family's hopes of bringing wealth to their name. Alec, the son of the family, attempts many times to seduce young Tess, and finally, one night, rapes her. Alec, shameless, seems to come across as a \\"stalker\\" at points, trying to get her to love him while Tess leaves an unhappy life on the estate. She eventually returns home and tries to start life anew.  <br /> <br />After a year of suffering, Tess, while working on a dairy farm, Tess meets, falls in love with, and eventually marries Angel Claire. This appears to finally be the saving grace in Tess' life, but both Tess and Angel have secrets from their past, and they both decide to reveal these on the first night of the honeymoon.  <br /> <br />I really felt like this confession scene with Tess and Angel worked so well because of the camera angles. After Tess forgives Angel for having an affair with an older woman, the scene shows Tess in front of Angel while she tells him her secret of becoming pregnant with Alec's child and eventually having her son die. The disappointment and mood of Angel rings forth as we see Angel become more and more somber before finally stating \\"I'm going out\\" leaving the room, and, in effect, Tess' life.  <br /> <br />From this point on, both Tess and Angel have their difficulties. Tess' struggles seem to be not only a burden for her individually, but also her family. One of the tragic themes of the film is that there are injustices in life, and we see this in how the Durbeyfield family struggles to live under a roof after their father's death, and how Tess falls deeper and deeper into despair.  <br /> <br />The movie is quite lengthy (3 hours), but I think this is because Polanski wanted to get all the essential aspects of the novel included. Like some have already stated, the DVD is not the best quality, but I didn't notice too many problems with mine. Overall, this is an effective rendition of Hardy's novel, and it might not be exactly as Hardy would have liked it, but the integrity of the work is clearly demonstrated.  <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|\\"Walk The Line\\" (2005) is the best music biopic since \\"Ray\\" (2004)! Joaquin Phoenix gives his Oscar nominated, career-best performance as Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon is just as equally impressive in her Oscar-winning performance as June Carter. They also did their vocals to the songs they performed in the movie and on the soundtrack itself. This is one of the year's best! This is a well-crafted and impressively told story about one of the greatest music legends of any generation and the love story between him and June Carter, the woman that gave on him. James Mangold's directing is brilliant and one of his best films to date! The screenplay by Mangold and Gill Dennis (which is based on Johnny Cash's books, The Man In Black and Cash: An Autobiography, which Cash co-wrote with Patrick Carr) is brilliant! The music by T-Bone Burnett (who brought life to the music of \\"O Brother, Where Are You\\" (2000) is brillant! The songs are brilliant! The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who also did the cinematography to Mangold's \\"Identity\\" (2003) is excellent! The film editing (Oscar nominated) by Michael McCusker is great!

B00005Q66Y|5.0|Bruckner 's Eighth Symphony is a landmark work. Listening with careful attention, has become gradually the most pyramidal of his Symphonies, relegating to secondary levels,  lofty architectural pieces such as the Fifth, the Seventh and the Farewell Ninth.<br /><br />The third movement is by far, the core of the Symphony, but its colossal proportions its radiating potency, its delirious high scale proportions do not demerit at all its intrinsic virtues .<br /><br />This is a very important version in the annals of the story. But I must confess I prefer by far, the Novak version.
B000000W5N|5.0|Back in '71 I stopped listening to the Stones altogether. I just didn't like the post Brian Jones material.  That \\"English\\" sound was gone.  Jump forward (as opposed to Jump Back) to 2005.  I see a brokerage advertisement on TV that features the Stones onstage (my how the world has changed) and realize how cool it is that these guys can still do their thing.  They were my favorites up until the end of the Jones era. I started looking at Stones CDs here on Amazon and read about Exile on Mainstreet.  Shortly afterward my daughter purchased Exile as a birthday gift.  I was just blown away.  One of the very best CDs in my collection.  I started doing a little more reading about this version of the Stones and learned about the Beggars Banquet - Let it Bleed - Sticky Fingers - Exile on Mainstreet run of releases and decided to buy them all.<br /><br />Sticky Fingers is a great CD even if Andy Warhol's cover art sucks.  Especially the back cover.  When will people realize this little emperor had no clothes?  I don't want to look at the shape of some dude's package in a pair of BVDs that look like they haven't been changed in days with skinny hairy legs and a hairy belly button protruding from bottom and top.  It's enough to put almost anyone off (I avoided this CD for a while just because I hated the cover so much).  Nevermind the cover art. The music more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Of the four CDs in the quartet of masterpieces (no, not the dude's package) mentioned above I have listened to this one the least but it is still superb.<br /><br />Brown Sugar is the best known song in this collection but it does not accurately reflect the depth of the music found here:<br /><br />Paul Buckmaster's strings arrangement of Moonlight Mile is simply wonderful.  This piece is based on something that sounds like a Irish folk melody, it has a very Celtic feel to it.  Maybe my favorite tune on this CD<br /><br />Reviewers here like to talk up Sister Morphine; while it's a great tune and very well written, there are certainly other tunes in this collection I enjoy much more.<br /><br />Can't You Hear Me Knockin' is a very mature arrangement and shows off Mick Taylor's ability to play great jazz lines. Some reviewers compare this solo to Carlos Santana but, as a serious guitar player myself, it's just the scale (the secret Carlos Santana Chord Progression and Scale - Dorian Mode) he's playing in.  Mick's playing here is far more 'thoughtful' than anything Mr Santana has ever played.  It's just... so much tastier!<br /><br />You Gotta Move is a wonderful rendition of an old Reverend Gary Davis tune. Very authentic Delta style blues.<br /><br />Wild Horses is a terrific Keith Richards song that has that country sound going on there with thoughtful lyrics.<br /><br />All the tracks are very good.  If you are going to run the table and buy all of the releases in the aforementioned quartet of masterpieces I would save this one for last.  It is definitely a must have but I just love the others a teeny bit more.<br /><br />My favorites (in order for this series)<br /><br />Exile on Mainstreet<br /><br />Beggars Banquet<br /><br />Let it Bleed<br /><br />Sticky Fingers<br /><br />I also highly recommend the SACD Hybrid release of Through the Past Darkly (rather than Hot Rocks) to round out this era of the Stones (it includes Honky Tonk Woman and Jumpin' Jack Flash) along with some really great tunes from the Brian Jones era.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Critics have been going after Our Lady from the beginning, and as with the stunning Ray of Light album, she has once again shown their mean-spirited criticism to be groundless and self indulgent. <br /> <br />This is easily one of her best albums, and yet more evidence of her endless ability to reinvent herself. I walked into an HMV store during the playing of Hung Up, and it wasn't until halfway through Get Together that I realized I was listening to a new Madonna album. I bought it immediately. <br /> <br />\\"Do you believe in love at first sight?\\" Yes, and I also believe Madonna is one of the most talented and creative artists/performers in the history of music. On the heels of the first Kate Bush album in 12 years, to have this classic from Madonna is to be blessed indeed.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I like history, and the complex episode of the Crusades is one of my all-time favourites, so I'm always wary of mass-public-oriented films about it, and I missed this movie in the theatres. However, since I also like Ridley Scott, the film finally landed in my DVD collection.     Nothing to regret here. As this director did in Gladiator, the story has more to do with the moral dilemma of the main character than with the political nightmare of the historical times depicted -something I've noticed many reviewers criticise. Ridley Scott is one of the few present-day directors (or artists in general) with the courage to speak through his films about the ethical crossroads that individuals (like you and me) must face in their lives.    Of course, not many individuals are going to find themselves in the middle of the Crusades, but that the story is set in a long-ago, very complicated historical time and place doesn't mean the ethical dilemma is not universal. And this dilemma is what Balain, the main character, must face at the beginnig of the film: that he has lost everything, he has been stripped of everything that made his life worth living (only that here, unlike in Galdiator, there is not a particular cause for this misfortune....it's just one of those tragedies that sometimes happen to people of all times and places).    When his unknown father appears out of the blue to offer him a new path in life, Balain sees the necessity to run away from his past, and joins his new-found father's men in their journey to Jerusalem. But what the father (a wonderful Liam Neeson) offers Balain is not an easy way out; he really shows him that he has not lost everything: he has his dignity and his honour....and that is something important, in fact, it is all-important. Now, really, how many directors or artists do you know who, in today's world, speak about the importance of honour and dignity? Not that many, I'm sure.    Balain's father dies in the way to Jerusalem, but not before making him a knight and giving him a clear moral code: that he must keep his honour and dignity through being always honest and fighting to defend the weak and helpless people....the code of the knights. A code that Balain will strive to keep in the strange and complex new situations that he'll find in Jerusalem, and especially when faced with clear opportunities to seize power or riches (a world with a complexity not unlike that of our own world, actually).    But for Balain, and for us the audience, Ridley Scott has pictured a Jerusalem that is a symbol of an individual's conscience: something that is very easy to sell or trade for a bit of power, or money, that you are tempted to betray every other day, for which you always have the best of excuses (in this case, of course, religion). We see most of the characters do this. But Balain, who has nothing to lose but his dignity, always makes decissions folowing the code his father taught him. When, in his last attempt to defend Jerusalem he makes all the soldiers there knights, and the bishop asks \\"do you think they will fight better just because they are knghts?\\", the answer Balain gives is a laconic \\"yes\\". Who doesn't \\"fight\\" better (and if we want to extrapolate the action of the film to any of our ordinary lives, we can take \\"fight\\" as \\"face the problems that we find in life\\") when they have a clear ethical code, when they know what they are fighting and living for?    So, and although in general the plot is not an aberration of the history of the Crusades (yes, they were an attempt at invading the area by European kings; yes, Saladdin took Jerusalem and allowed people to get out without harm; yes, Kerak -Krak des Chevaliers, in today's Syria- was used by his lord, whose name I can't remember right now, as a base from which to attack pilgrims' caravans, etc), this is not the most important at all. What is important is that the director places an individual in a highly complex world (such as ours is) and shows howhe can survive and find a sense in what he is doing thanks to a clear moral code (such as many individuals in today's world don't have). Thank you for this message, Ridley Scott.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|This movie is absolutely horrible!Who cares if it`s a \\"Two-Disk Deluxe Edition\\"!!!!That doesn`t make it any better,cause theres not a bonus feature that tells you how they made this movie so stupid and boring!Johnny Depp is usually a pretty good actor,but he`s a ridiculus Willy Wonka!And the Oompa Loompas are the dumbest things I have ever seen!They look like a bunch of really old mexican women! <br />And some more things: <br />They totally picked the wrong kid to play Mike Tevee! <br />The Great Glass Elevator looks totally fake!!! <br /> <br />Man,the first version was so much better!Buy it!Don`t buy this!
B000AARKOO|3.0|Kingdom of Heaven isn't what I expected. Script-wise, it stank... I'm sorry to say. The dialogue given to the various characters was incredibly cheesy, and seems to have been culled from a \\"What the Politically Correct Characters Would Say Had They Been In A Crusade\\" book.<br /><br />Firstly, as others have mentioned... yes, the Christians are portrayed appallingly in this, and as I have reason to know, many are taking this film as being historically accurate. There is a definite slant here that is not unbiased.<br /><br />The casual - no, the STUPID - cruelty shown by the bad guys (exclusively French \\"Christians\\") in the film is beyond belief. Subtlety is clearly not Ridley Scott's keyword, and he likes to draw his characters as though they were escapees from a comic book, with their clear-cut \\"villain\\" attitude. I'd have loved to see more complexity - even a little - in the characters thus portrayed...<br /><br />Orlando Bloom was neither spectacular nor awful in this film. He portrayed what he was supposed to - and there were some genuinely powerful moments in the film. One of them is when Bloom hears that his wife's dead body was beheaded.<br /><br />But the whole segment with Bloom's duel with a Muslim, release of a \\"slave\\" (who turns out to be a noble - what a surprise), etc., is ridiculous. It's highly unlikely a noble of the Arabs would have allowed himself to be treated like a servant in such a way.<br /><br />Norton's portrayal of the King is actually splendid - one of the best things about the film. Similarly, the actress playing his sister does a good job with her character.<br /><br />But the story suffers from its preachiness. Scott is hammering home his sermon, and it's that Christians should never have tried to hang on to Jerusalem. The only kingdom of heaven there is, he is telling us, is our own conscience. Mm-hmm... but human conscience is already shown, by his own film, to be an unreliable thing, even in the best of us. Human frailty, morally speaking, drives some people to unspeakable things - and perhaps it would be better to blame human nature for the atrocities committed by some people than religion. After all, religion is belief, and belief is acted upon by people in different ways, depending upon their own nature...<br /><br />... So the \\"message\\" of the film rings rather hollow.<br /><br />The battle scenes struck me as owing rather a lot to the Lord of the Rings films, with one or two good moments, but in general, I thought, \\"Goodness, I've seen this before.\\"<br /><br />The proposition made by the king to Bloom's character was bizarre - it frankly didn't make sense. If the king wanted his sister's husband not to seize power, he could have had the man arrested and executed for treason. It DIDN'T need Bloom's co-operation!  This was a glaring problem in the plot.<br /><br />But perhaps there was nothing worse than the dreadful, dreadful \\"Let's just hold out for long enough to negotiate so that we can save the lives of the people\\" bit. Historically justifiable? No. NO ONE ever fought a battle for Jerusalem thinking that. In no way did the Christians WIN that particular battle. They were beaten. They held out for long enough that they did finally negotiate a surrender, but that was by no means the plan. That piece of mendacity was clearly thought up in order to give the film a Hollywood happy ending.<br /><br />At any rate, I finally decided to watch the film again without thinking about the historical and religious inaccuracies. I found that I could mildly enjoy it in terms of an adventure, but that it still didn't quite work on that level, either.<br /><br />The pluses: Orlando Bloom looks fine. (Perhaps he cannot quite give such a thankless role an individual touch yet, but I'm all in favour of giving him the opportunity to try, in the hope that one day he will find himself fully as an actor. The gift is there.) Norton's King is fine. The costumes are fantastic. The sets and the whole look are fine.<br /><br />The minuses: the story is often ridiculous. The historical inaccuracies are plentiful. There seems to be a religious bias against Christianity. The dialogue sounds awfully cheesy. The Point of View seems very 21st century rather than 13th or 14th century.<br /><br />Three stars for the look, the action, and the casting. The story is not well told - that's the main drawback.seems to be a religious bias against Christianity. The dialogue sounds awfully cheesy.

B000B8QEZG|1.0|As it has been described, this album is NOT ONLY a mixture of influences of artists such as Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer, ABBA and even KYLIE MINOGUE.  Actually, it is a lackluster attempt to resurrect a career of a MATERIAL SINGER whose steps have gone nowhere after the mid-90s; acting like a copycat and a GRIFTTER is remembering us how huge 70s and 80s electronic performers and producers used to be. This album shows us a total scarcity of originality but if you are a MADONNA die-hard, deaf fan you should download this one through a p2p engine and save your money from SCAM
B0000640VN|3.0|Hugh Jackman is the last guy you'd expect to appear in a romantic comedy, particularly viewing the films he's done in the past. But he pulls it off, and manages to hold the film together, especially since he's appearing alongside Ice Maiden Meg Ryan. Alongside Liev Schreiber, they make the film worthwhile, with Liev getting a decent character to get his teeth into, rather than the cardboard cut-out he played in the Scream movies.<br /><br />This is a more-or-less modern fairytale, with various elements of Back To The Future thrown in, with your usual predictable storyline. Girl hates guy on sight, learns to like him, learns to love him, and then they do something wrong to lose each other. I didn't get how a man who was originally from the 19th century managed to adapt in the 21st century, it was highly unbelievable, but Hughie manages to succeed.<br /><br />On the bad side, it is a bit too long for a romantic comedy, and there's a lot of plotholes. The time travelling storyline is never really explained, and worked a lot better in the Back To The Future movies. There's also hints at incest, which will be seem ridiculous to the audience, but doesn't take away anything from the movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately Meg Ryan no longer has the innocent magic that she had in When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless In Seattle, which she started to lose around the same time as You've Got Mail. She could have pulled the whole movie down around her ears, if it hadn't been for Hugh's elegant gentleman, with plenty of charisma thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Not a date movie. The guy will hate it, the girl will love it, and will go all soppy. Believe me, your boyfriend will not appreciate being told to dress up like Hugh Jackman's character. Not a good fantasy.
B00006879E|4.0|When I first got this CD, which I originally bought when it came out in 2002, I played it so much that I had to put it away for a long time. I recently stumbled upon it again, and I can't put it down. The hooks and melodies are as good as I remember them to be and if I did not know any better, I would swear that there are additives on the CD.<br /><br />The band has this amazing energy and a eager to please song delivery that will annoy some elitist reviewers who have lost touch with the concept that most of us buy music to be entertained. For those who may not be familiar with the band, they have a funky middle of the road rock/pop sensibility that you'll find hard to resist. Think matchbox 20 light meets Jamiroquai. Almost every song is/was a single waiting to happen.<br /><br />Maroon 5 is one of those bands that will get little respect from many critics and purists, but will hopefully continue to release CDs as accessible as this one. They have not released something since 2002, so it may either be a great sign that they did not try and go back to the well too soon or .... we'll see. For now, I would recommend this release, which sounds as fresh as when it was first released.

0790732203|5.0|This movie is a touchstone for the 1980's as it captures the materialistic and transactional values that were even more prevalent than they are now. If Joel, as played by Tom Cruise, had come from a blue collar family, one could argue that he could in time become Bud Fox (the Charlie Sheen character) from \\"Wall Street.\\"<br /><br />I saw this movie when it first came out in 1983 and was exactly Joel's age and remember loving it just because it was cool, had great music, was funny, and (independently of some over the top comedic gems) rang very true to life. At the time it seemed that if you did not ace your SAT's, it would be the end of the world. This was a seminal period for movies made for young adults that did not pander to them, and this is one of the best.<br /><br />I just finished watching the DVD for this movie, which I had not seen since it was released 22 years ago. While so much had happened in these 2+ decades, the film could be released today and it would probably be a smash. Of course the studio, unfortunately would force the director to go for a PG-13 rating, thus taking away a great deal of the movie's best moments. For those who have kids, this is not a movie for them, as it earns its R rating.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the movie tells the coming of age story of Joel Goodsen, the perfect son from the perfect six figure earning suburban family. The family has the house, toys, values, and perfect lawn. Without giving anything away as I don't like reviews that reveal too much, the perfect son has the house to himself while his parents are out of town. The rest you'll have to experience for yourself.<br /><br />The performances are perfect across the board. Tom Cruise (before he became megastar \\"Tom Cruise\\" or had started jumping up and down like a madman on \\"Oprah\\") gives the movie its foundation, and he is supported by a brilliant cast (Rebecca De Morney is simply amazing), script and direction. The makers captured the feel of Joel's world (down to his Docksiders and Nikes) and the excitement that he was embarking on. I can't find much to quibble when it comes to this movie, but if I must, some of the kids did look a little long on the tooth (yes you Bronson Pinchot) to be in high school, but could you imagine \\"Grease\\" without Stockard Channing? I rest my case.<br /><br />If you are looking for an entertaining, funny, insightful movie that describes what it was to be 17 or 18 in 1983 (well if your parents had bucks), this would be a riskless choice. To those of us who have grown to dislike Tom Cruise in recent years, I can say that my biases were easily put aside as this performance put me in touch with a rising star. Like Julia Roberts in \\"Pretty Woman,\\" here Tom looked like regular guy (Ok, with above-average looks) who the audience could empathize with. Easily earns its 5 stars within its genre.wn to his Docksiders and Nikes) and the excitement that he was embarking on.

To those of us who have grown to dislike Tom Cruise in recent years, I can say that my biases were easily put aside as this performance put me in touch with a rising star. Like Julia Roberts in \\"Pretty Woman,\\" here Tom looked like regular guy (Ok, with above-average looks) who the audience could empathize with. Easily earns its 5 stars within its genre.  <br /> <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|\\"Walk The Line\\" tells the story of Johnny Cash from about age 12 up thru 1968. The movie is very well done. During parts of the movie you feel like you're watching Cash home movies. Phoenix does an incredible job, not only in portraying Cash but in singing his songs as well. He nails the mannerisms right down to the sideways smile. At times you get chills watching his performance as the resemblence is uncanny. Not so much for Reese Witherspoon, although she also does her own singing and does a great job in her portrayal, I kept seeing Reese and not June. I really liked this movie. Although it doesn't drag it does seem like it's a lot longer than it is. Also as with most bio-pics they stop at a point when things seem to settle down in the career. The movie tells the story of the man in black and his start in the music business. It follows him as he tries to win the heart of June Carter. Along the way other various big names pop up, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Shooter Jennings playing his father Waylon.  <br /> A great movie that is certainly Oscar worthy if for nothing else that for Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal. There's a lot of great music along the way! When June died in 2003 everyone said that Johnny wouldn't last long without her. He didn't. Seeing this movie you understand why.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|I don't like this movie, but I want to comment on something that some other haters of the movie keep saying. That the ending of this film is supposed to condone Jimmy's actions. Jimmy isn't supposed to be a righteous hero. The message isn't that that justice was served. Just the opposite, it's just showing us more pointless, demoralizing misery. Just another punch in the jaw to the audience.  <br /> <br />This movie is a meaningless, hateful film that's only message seems to be \\"life sucks\\". Call me kooky, but I don't see movies so that I can feel even worse about humanity and life in general. I knew this movie was going to be heavy subject matter but this is just a gratuitous portrait of misery. I expected something deeper, some kind of sense of spirituality, of humanity. Instead it seems to think misery is all the meaning and reason it needs. But for some bizzare reason it seems to think it's very important. It's so overblown it's ridiculous. The movie is filled with crappy people living crappy lives. If I want to deal with people this nasty and worthless I don't need to go to the movies. No one ever traumatised by anything is going to get anything positive out of the portrayal of Dave. It's skewed disgustingly and is downright irresponsible. The ending is just plain STUPID. When I saw it I couldn't believe that this sloppy lameness was what the mystery had \\"unraveled\\" as. The acting's decent. Big deal. It takes more than solid acting to impress me, and the acting is overrated anyway. Tim Robins would probably be better off on the stage. There are technical flaws in the way the movie was shot. The sound is HORRIBLE.  <br /> <br />But what it really comes down to is that there's really nothing positive you can get out of this movie. See it if you want to give up on life. Some would say that the fact that the film moved me enough to make me deeply miserable makes it a \\"good\\" movie. I say my ass. To just grab the audiences' emotions and abuse them and then let them drop is wrong. There's enough trauma in people's lives without leaving them with an artificial trauma to deal with. This wasted my time and worse, my emotions. I can't reccomend this movie to anyone unless they're masochists.
B0002OERI0|2.0|The question of if and/or when Green Day sold out has been rampant in the music world ever since the release of their 1994 breakthrough album, Dookie. Some people said that they sold out with their last album 2000's largely-acoustic \\"Warning,\\" or with the 1997 ballad \\"Time of Your Life\\" (a great song, marred by endless spins on MTV, radio and school dances). There are even some die hard \\"punk rockers\\" that say the band sold out when they signed their names to their Reprise Records contract. True, \\"Dookie\\" sold 10 million copies, and Warning had very little of the punk riffs and attitude that Green Day was so famous for, but Green Day actually jumping the shark or selling out didn't really happen. Up until now... <br /> <br />Before its release in September 2004, the title track was sprung onto radio, and it had a fast-paced, simplistic melody to it, but Billie Joe Armstrong's vocal delivery didn't sound as inspired or emotional as it did during the days of \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Insomniac,\\" and came off sounding more like Joel Madden than Johnny Rotten. This was a disappointment, because the song's lyrical content was an unabashed protest of the George W. Bush administration. Not one to give up on a band I have admired for a long time, I picked up the album anyway, after hearing some pretty good reviews about it. Only to trade it in a few months later... and here's why: <br /> <br />First off, the main singles were overexposed; American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Holiday, and (just recently) Wake Me Up When September Ends. I heard these songs everywhere. MTV, radio, every restaurant I ate at, where I worked, the YMCA, the local grocery store. EVERYWHERE! There was just no escape of the mas infiltration of the songs on the album that became singles and that, honestly, weren't even the best cuts on the album. I would also like to pinpoint that Green Day has also seemed to lost their sense of humor upon the release of American Idiot. Known for a long time for their zanyantics, every time I saw Green Day on TV or in a magazine in an interview, they posed themselves as revolutionaries and social commentators, which isn't bad, but they took themselves way too seriously, as if they were running for office themselves. Them adding eyeliner to the mix also made them in the ranks of Good Charlotte. I don't have anything against eyeliner - I wear it myself - but it definitely added to their overbearingly serious approach. They acted like American Idiot would stop the Iraq War and just catapult John Kerry into office. Despite their efforts and having this record go multi-platinum, Bush got re-elected and the Iraq War is still going on. Come Grammy time, they were nominated for Album of the Year, and they were quoted saying that winning the top honor, Album of the Year, would \\"restore my faith in rock and roll.\\" The band was shut out to the late Ray Charles, but that's besides the point. The Green Day of 1994, heck even 2001, would not have cared for such a prestigious honor. Considering that not even Nirvana got nominated for Album of the Year by the Grammys, such a statement could definitely minimize what little street cred they did have left, and make them seem all but pretentious.  <br /> <br />Even on the album itself (press meanderings aside), the songs seemed like slowed-down versions of hits such as \\"Basket Case\\" and \\"Nice Guys Finish Last.\\" Songs, like \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\\" seem melodramatic in a way. Despite this, the passion has also been lost in Billie Joe's vocals. He never had the most resonating voice, true, but I felt more in his voice when he was talking of ennui in \\"Long View,\\" and even bittersweet farewells in their biggest single for a long time, \\"Time of Your Life.\\" Now it seems that Billie Joe is just singing for the sake of it, and the band is just playing music to keep on going. Musically, the band is still energetic, and still proficient, but \\"American Idiot\\" lacks the youthful fire the band was so recognized for isn't there. Maturity is just not serving Green Day very well. Surprisingly, it served better for blink 182, whose last album before they went on hiatus was commendable at best because they explored new emotions and new sounds. American Idiot retreats more of the same territory, but only slower and less enthusiastic. The great irnoy of that is that the members of the band seemed more enthusiastic about their social message and the impact their album could have had.  <br /> <br />One could see Green Day as a version of the Who of their generation. They start out as a pure, no frills rock band, and their early output is energetic, lively and revolutionary. \\"Longview\\" could have been their \\"My Generation\\" (whih Green Day actually covered on their 1987 Sweet Children EP), and an early Green Day show was full of raw, visceral energy and the band seemed like they were having a blast (pun intended). Then, with the release of American Idiot, a rock opera, they toy with the idea of trying to tell a story with an album and expanding their musical horizons, and being pretentious in the process, and seeing themselves from a view that seemed unheard of. The Who were the same way. The Who's early stuff was brilliant and full of angst, and then they released Tommy, an over-conceptualized album that thrusted Pete Townshend from legendary guitar smasher to a psychologically tortured guy that writes rock operas. Except for a few songs, the Who could not compete with their earlier repetoire, and their latter day dramatic albums made the band draw fire from their earliest fans. Johnny Rotten even caled the Who in 1976 \\"more of a business than a band,\\" which was a harsh blow because the Who was considered one of punk's earliest influences. The same thing just might happen to Green Day. More than ever, they seem to be more of a franchise than a rock and roll band. They're now playing stadiums, getting airplay on soft rock stations and seem to have lost sight of what they originally were. As an album American Idiot isn't bad. The band's first stab at an epic \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is definitely on par with some of their finer moments, despite being at a very non-punk rock 9 minutes long, and \\"Are We the Waiting\\" definitely could cancel out my statements about Green Day not being a very emotional band anymore, and can prove that they're still capable of writing anthemic songs with resonance and a good deal of energy. The songwriting, however, mainly suffers from the fact that they wrote most of these riffs in the past decade, with the exception of \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\" It's fine to make your songs polished. Just listen to anything the Clash did beyond their debut, or Husker Du when they got signed to a major label. Those two bands, both tremendous influences of Green Day, created records that both were accessible in their own ways and expanded the imagination of the listener. However, instead of creating this generation's Cnady Apple Grey (I'd use Zen Arcade as an example, but Husker Du recorded it in a mere 83 hours) or London Calling, Green Day focused too much on elaboration and not throwing new elements into their mix. However, even at Green Day's worst, they still are more listenable than their contemporaries and their followers.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is your LAST day, SATURDAY, to buy \\"The Emancipation of Mimi - ULTRA PLATINUM EDITION\\" for $11.99. It's currently STILL on sale at TARGET, BEST BUY, and CIRCUIT CITY. It was featured in the Sunday circular from 11/13/05.    If you're buying the original today, you're in essence getting ripped off. Why? For the exact same price, you can get 4 EXTRA SONGS:     \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" (Mariah's current hit)   \\"Makin' It Last All Night\\" (the #3 song on AOL Music featuring Jermaine Dupri)   \\"So Lonely (One and Only Part II)\\" (featuring Twista)   \\"We Belong Together - Remix\\" (featuring Jadakiss and Styles P.)     The above 4 are excellent. In my opinion, they're what make the re-release better than the original.       In addition you get 4 MUSIC VIDEOS:     \\"It's Like That\\" (Mariah's first Single)   \\"Shake It Off\\" (her second single)   \\"We Belong Together\\" (#1 Hot 100 hit)   \\"Get Your Number.\\"     The DVD is great. While you're going through the menus it plays the \\"We Belong Together\\" instrumental in the background. You can play the videos individually or continuously. It looks wonderful. This IS NOT a cheap presentation. The CD booklet has a glossy front and back. Mariah's name is embossed in silver lettering on the CD cover. It's a GREAT CD/DVD at the AMAZING price of $11.99. You should get this item for the holiday if you don't already have the original. How can you beat that price???
0767821629|4.0|It seemed like play: a simulation world, but one that feels real. Fuller created it, or led the team that created, and was the first to enter it. Instead of the player suddenly materializing, his mind occupies one of the people of the ongoing simulation. Almost like demonic possession, where the simulated person never remembers what happened.<br /><br />Then Fuller is killed, and leaves a clue to his killer somewhere in the game. The problem is, the pieces in this game are playing themselves, and start making their own rules.<br /><br />There's good action, but it's hardly a guns'n'chases flick. Maybe it's about the creator's duty to the creation, or about keeping track of what matters. Or maybe it's about playing a game where the rules keep changing right down to the end - because that's the part that changes everything that came before.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0670033375|4.0|Mr. Diamond's follow up to the Pulitzer Prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel offers a sobering look into what I call the geoenvironmental reasons certain past civilizations have failed.  He expands on the themes developed in his previous work in an attempt to get the reader to think about our future. <br /> <br />It is an especially timely book, given the on-going debate over global warming which could be the biggest challenge man has faced. <br /> <br />While it is not as an enthralling read as Guns, Germs, and Steel, it is a more thought provoking book.  I found myself thinking about the issues raised in the book and hoping that we can use the examples of the more sustatinable countries cited in the book.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|In my opinion it was the best movie ever. I dont care what the others said, saying its stupid it rocked.It deals with a nerdy big haired looser thats trying to make it through High school.When he meets a new guy at the school named pedro they become friends and with a little help from Napoleon Pedro runs for school president. I know some others think it stinks by what Napoleon says, like \\"gosh!!, flippin, and sweet\\" i think its funny when he says it.I've wathced it many times and it never fails. Especially when he does thelow breathing thing at the begining of the movie.Me and my best friend thinks thats so funny.But then ending could have been better. I think the fans of this movie would have liked it if Napoleon and Deb kissed at the end. I hope they make a Napoleon Dynamite 2.This is the best flippin movie of all time!!!!!
B0001CNRSE|1.0|The only possible reason to watch this sorry movie would be for the advertised dancing, except the dancing was TERRIBLE. watch You Got Served or RIZE for great dancing.

0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki delineates between employees, one-person business owners, business owners with employees, and investors. He gives a compelling argument for large business ownership by explaining tax disadvantages to the employee and time limitations to the one-person business practitioner. He also explains the value of investment.  He doesn't advocate risky ventures, but does suggest strategies to move from employee and one-person business status to business ownership and investment status.  He advocates creating positive cash flow, and is partial to income-producing real estate ownership which produces positive cash flow. This book could be retitled, Financial Freedom 101.
B00005JMXX|1.0|because even though approx. 2 billion people died in this movie, the dork gets the chick and dad survives his icy trek to the library so its a happy ending.   <br /> <br />Is is a coincidence that the vice president looked exactly like the real Dick Cheney...hmmm  <br /> <br />I really like how the US had to forgive all latin american debt before mexico opened its border to the freezing \\"refugees\\".  (the freezing temperatures were not allowed to cross the border) How kind of them to let us come! <br /> <br />This movie will seem like scary realism to those people (we all know them) who base their belief in global warming on the kind of anecdotal evidence expressed in statements such as: \\"Man it is really HOT today! I just don't ever remember it being this hot! Must be global warming..\\" when you try to remind them that earth's history did not begin when they turned 14, they insist \\"come on, it didn't used to be THIS hot!\\" Ok fine, whatever, ride your bike to work if it makes you happy...I'm sure that will bring down the temperature. <br /> <br />This entire movie is trite, ridiculous, unbelievable, unscientific, and silly. It is poorly written hollywood liberal elitist treehugging antiamerican radical environmentalist propaganda! But the effects do look great! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000WJZ|5.0|Having always been a Smashing Pumpkins fan, when ever the words \\"mellon collie\\" or \\"siamese\\" or \\"gish\\" etc are mentioned around me, i naturally think of Billy Corgan, James Iha, Jimmy Chamberlin, and D'arcy.  However, I would have to say that I did overplay them a bit when I was younger.  So, for about a year, this record, along with the every other Smashing Pumpkins album ever mass produced, sat on my shelves, and gathered dust.  After reading Spin Magazine's Top 100 Albums Of The Last 20 Years, I was reminded of what an impact Siamese Dream had on my life.  And not just mine, but all my friends' lives.  And not just my friends' lives, but everybody who had ever been lucky enough to hear \\"Cherub Rock\\" through \\"Luna.\\"  I quickly went and found the dusty album, turned up the volume, sat down on my couch, and let it play.  What was I thinking? How could I have not touched this album, or any other genius Smashing Pumpkins work, for atleast an entire year?!  My initial thoughts upon hearing this album for the first time, ever: \\"Whoa......these guys are AWESOME.\\" <br /> <br />Between the classic \\"Cherub Rock,\\" the intimidating \\"Today,\\" the emotional \\"Disarm,\\" and the bipolar and moody (but still good) \\"Silverf***,\\" this album can be loved by anyone.  If you're just getting into the Smashing Pumpkins, I DEFINITLY recommend this masterpiece.  If you love the band, but don't have the record, what are you thinking?!  Buy it, NOW!
B00005U8EM|5.0|you may scoff at that statement...but this movie has different levels <br />LOWER LEVEL: This is a extremely funny movie <br />NEXT LEVEL: This is a movie that makes you think what would you do if you were Bill Murray and had this situation...that is getting your brain chugging a little in anticipation of the... <br />HIGHER LEVEL: This is where the underlying philosophical theme comes in.  What is it really about? You must watch it at least 5 times before you are ready to address this question, because you are still working through the lower two levels of the movie, and you won't have a clear vision until you get over some of the funnier bits. you just need to watch it and figure it out for yourself, if i just tell you flat out it won't benefit you as much.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|This is one movie you don't want to watch with your kids.  While I normally find foul language, pointless nudity, and violence rather annoying in most movies, they are an integral part of conveying the writer's and director's themes in this brutal critique of modern society. <br /> <br />The editorial review on Amazon says not to expect subtlety in this production.  That reviewer is missing the point.  The extreme obnoxiousness of the sex and violence in this movie featuring puppets is a subtle statement about the artistic effectiveness of these ploys in more \\"serious\\" movies.  It must be great acting if puppets without genitals or other less mentionable parts are conveying anal sex. <br /> <br />On 15 Nov, former CIA Chief James Woolsey cited, in congressional testimony no less, this movie as the type of propaganda that needed to be directed toward Iran's new demagogic leader.  He said, \\"After watching Team America, World Police, how can anyone take Kim Jong II seriously?\\" <br /> <br />This movie takes no prisoners in its sweeping contempt.  From right wing neo-cons who would lead the world to chaos to save it from islamo-fascists to idiotic liberal actors who believe because they pretend to be smart people on TV, they really are smart people, no one escapes the brunt of this \\"comedy\\". <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The clever thing about the order this movie is presented, it puts you in the same mindset with the main character: you don't know whats going on, your just popped into a situation like he is, reading messages off his body, trying to figure it out with him as you go.      This not only is effective for that reason, but it makes the second and third and fourth viewings more interesting because you can then 'begin' to piece it all together    I watched it in reverse order (chronologically) by starting on the last chapter then scanning backward as I finished each one.  ThaT took alot of concentration and i messed it up alot but i got the main idea and its much better watched like it was meant to be, but thats a fun project to pursue later if you have patience...see this movie keeps giving long after other ones are forgotten on a shelf!     Guy Pearce is one of those characters I find extremely watchable.  I don't know what it is but I think it has to do with his face and voice, like an intriquing quality. Weird thing is I think I would like the feeling of punching his face, especially if he's wearing glasses like in la confidential, so for some reason I think it would feel good to punch through the glasses into his face. He just has that kind of face but I really like the actor Guy Pearce don't get me wrong, its just a punchable face thats all, like it would be satisfying to do so
B000065V1V|2.0|Several covers and return of Toni Visconti make Heathen a worthwhile listen.  It is hard to believe anyone who has actually heard early Bowie, would claim this is 'as good or better'.  Every release has people saying hes better than ever, but a year later no one is listening to the same record.  His 70s and 80s work, remains influential to this day, though his body of work overall seems out of fashion at the moment.   <br /> <br />This is pop from a pop genius who long ago lost his muse and inspiration.  What remains is servicable pop, and a few excellent tracks to discover among the mire.  It is hard to say Bowie ever made a bad album, everything past lets dance, has been at best unimportant, at worst mediocre formula pop.

0439679958|2.0|The Review from the Scotsman states : \\"Gripping, full of suspense and as twisty as an Alpine pass. Matt Freeman's adventures eclipse even those of the  formidable Alex Rider...\\" <br />The \\"twistiness\\" seems more due to a lack of focus - it does feel \\"made up\\" and stitched together from disparate ideas while lacking an overall cohesive structure - very sad for the first of a continuing series (Power of Five - does that mean there will be five books?). In many ways it fits that category of those novels yet to be actually written - this was an early draft/notes towards what should have been developed and refined before being published further down the track. <br /> <br />The lack of an overall solidity in structure is apparent when matched to the author's stated aim of being nothing less than broadly challenging both CS Lewis AND Tolkien - \\"Why do you have to invent places..... Isn't it more exciting to imagine these great battles with all their magic and mystery happening in the very high street where you live... just out of the corner of your eye? This has been  at the heart of my work for the last twent years.\\" <br /> <br />To set the record straight - there actually is no battle on the 'high street' of the protagonist's environment, indeed  <br />the story invests so much effort in alienating the protagonist from every setting - and character - there is little left for the story to do but pile alienation upon further alienation. He is \\"at home\\" absolutely nowhere in the story. <br /> <br />In this way it seems obvious that the author does not understand at all the point of the separation from Narnia and the \\"real world\\" as it appears in Lewis' novels. In fact, the author spends most of the novel - himself - \\"making up\\" the eerily bizarre settings of Hive Hall and the village of Lesser Malling. Some elements of the narrative are very interesting when you consider the target market for this story. Most striking is the complete absence of any other character of the protagonist's age. The nearest in personality/age is pretty well written off by the 2nd chapter as \\"pathetic\\".  The protagonist spends the entire novel in complete conflict with every character (all adults) save for one.  To call his association with that character a relationship would indeed be stretching it as the story makes clear it is initiated by the detective in his official capacity only. While the relationship had plenty of room to develop in the story it is unfortunately cut short by the plot. <br /> <br />The novel ends with the protagonist associated with a character but it's an association based not on sympathetic relationship but on very questionable motive and - his attachment expressed so \\"surprisingly\\" (the story's very own words, not mine) suggests it is driven more for the sake of future plot and  <br />the tying of very questionable threads to support the illusion of narrative resolution. The fact this appears so suddenly at the 4th last page of the book only increases this suspicion.  This is very different to the association developed by \\"similar\\" characters in novels such as Kings \\"Salem's Lot\\". Until that point the character of the journalist has made it absolutely clear his only attachment to Matt is based on the professional advantage Matt's story can offer him. <br /> <br />So we have a novel where the protagonist really has no sympathetic relationship with anybody at all. <br /> <br />The structure is very unbalanced and tries to play clever games that it later wishes it didn't play.  Did Matt smash the water tumbler while in earlier confinement? maybe - maybe not.  Sadly, the latter portion of narrative relies on no such play on ambiguity.  The entire \\"3rd act\\" requires absolute and total definition on this and other points.  There is also an apparent lack of motive for the narrative itself - if Mattwas \\"the one\\" was he going to remain possibly languishing within the steadily decaying environment of his stepmother's while the followers ofthe Old Ones (shades of Lovecraft) continue on with their expensive and timely efforts (20 years worth we are later told) at preparing the Raven's Gate?  The story really can't have it both ways - either Matt was known to them well before his committal or he wasn't.  The report clippings in Mrs Deverill's room clearly show he was known to them since he was 8 yrs old. <br /> <br />The dilemma this places on the narrative structure is considerable - Matt was offered the choice of either the Leaf project (the story is admanant - he had to volunteer) or spend the next three years in an institution - well beyond the reaches of Mrs Deverill and the followers of the Old Ones. If Matt had not even visited the warehouse with kelvin - what then for those years of preparations?  Did they truly think his disappearance under fostercare - and under such a highly publicised scheme as LEAF - would go unnoticed and unchallenged? <br /> <br />Other features of the novel are also amusing - for some reason it is important to the novel that Matt is of stunningly atractive appearance - almost a model. Every other character is portrayed in far lesser virtues of physical description. Indeed, the story makes much of one woman's unfortunate possession of a birthmark as proof of her inherent evil.  If the protagonist was not working class himself one easily could consider the rendition of the working classes of jolly old contemporary england as almost hysterical and bordering on 20th century Dickens. <br /> <br />For a 14 year old male I would recommend much more sophisticated - and well worn - fare. Ursula le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a much better value contribution towards the imagination - regardless of its lack of battles \\"on the high street.\\"  I am amazed to read of 14 year olds actually sticking all the way to the end with this story as there is little inherent memorable literary charm to the language - it's very much british \\"kitchen sink\\" narrative.  A fact not unnoticed by admirers of CS Lewis. <br />
B00000DGRX|5.0|Machine Head (1972.), Deep Purple's sixth studio album<br /><br />Deep Purple are one of the all time great classic rock acts, and sadly probably one of the most underrated. After a relatively obscure start, producing 3 albums in the late 1960's which were good but sadly commercial failures, the band changed its line up. From here, the classic MK2 line-up of Ian Gillan (vocals), Richie Blackmore (lead guitar), Roger Glover (bass), John Lord (keyboards) and Ian Paice (drums) strung together a number of great albums. The first was 'In Rock', a bit raw but a masterpiece none the less and the second was 1971's 'Fireball', a bit experimental but thoroughly classic Deep Purple. Following this, the band went to Montreux in Switzerland (for tax exemption purposes) to cut their next studio album. However, tragedy struck when the band's proposed recording spot burnt down in a Frank Zappa show. Undeterred however, the band set up a place to record in the Grand Hotel at Montreux and put together the songs that would make up the 'Machine Head' album. Since then, 'Machine Head' has grown to be Deep Purple's most praised and popular album. This afterall is the album which features 'THE riff' in 'Smoke On The Water'. So how good does this album turn out to be?<br /><br />Deep Purple's 'Machine Head' deserves all of the respect it gets, it is a masterpiece of an album. Eventhough this is not my favourite Deep Purple album ('Fireball' pips it at the post IMO) there is no denying that this album features the band at their technical best and their most fluent. The quality of this album is all the more remarkable given that the band had to record the whole thing in a Hotel corridor and to pull off a near perfect album speaks volumes for the band's ability. Since the album's release, it has gone on to be remebered most of all as the work that features 'Smoke On The Water', the song with perhaps the most famous riff of all time, known even to those who aren't into rock. However, in many ways this is an unfair reflection on the album as all 7 tracks are great. I think personally that 'Smoke On The Water' is matched by songs like 'Lazy' and is probably bettered by 'Highway Star' and 'Space Truckin'. The album is THAT good! The album is catchy, without being inherantly commercial. Indeed there is plenty of complex stuff on here; the riffing is fast and inspired at times and the keyboard blended sound is something special. All of the band give stellar performances. Ian Gillan's vocals have their usual unique style to them and he gives a diverse performance. Richie Blackmore's riffing is great and his solos are effortlessly executed in style. Roger Glover's strong bass play adds that extra heaviness to the music and John Lord's nifty work on the Hammond organ gives the unique Deep Purple sound. Ian Paice's drumming is fast, complex and rhythm perfect; he is definitely the most UNDERRATED drummer of all time and is up there with the best. All in all, 'Machine Head' features the band at their peak producing timeless hard rock songs that have become influences for plenty of bands to follow - and at the same time the music has that uplifting 'good time' feel to it!<br /><br />Currently you can obtain the 'Machine Head' album in two versions. The first is the standard album remaster featuring the original remaster. No fuss there, your getting a classic album anyway. However, if you want to pay out the extra cash, get the anniversary edition which features a complete new sounding master of the album, with extended sections to the songs and a bonus out-take track in 'When A Blind Man Cries' which is a bluesy styled, slow track which develops into a heartfelt performance from the band.<br /><br />The 'Machine Head' juggernaut kicks off with one of the band's great songs. 'Highway Star' is a fast paced rocker with a very metal sound to it ... trust me, my friends, speed metal has its roots in songs like this! Gillan aggressively flies though the vocals like a manpossessed alongside plenty of racing guitar sections from Blackmore. This is the way to start an album! 'Maybe I'm A leo' follows, a great song although it's the weakest on this very high standard album. The riffing again is great and inspired. 'Pictures Of Home' is another brisk rocking song, with Gillan singing on a theme of longing for your homelands. Next is one of the more catchy songs on the album in 'Never Before'. The band really thought this would be their biggest hit off the album and released it as a single. Obviously it became overshadowed. Its a brilliant song though, with a funky keyboard solo from Lord with some creative drumming. Again the riff is timeless.<br /><br />The second half opens up with the famous track on the album. What a riff Richie Blackmore stumbled on here; 'Smoke On The Water' is deservedly famous; its an awesome song. The lyrics are based on the theme of the fire at the Frank Zappa show and Gillan executes them fantastically. Blackmore jams out another great solo and Lord's keyboard undertones are inspired throughout, as they are also in the next track 'Lazy'. This 7 minute masterpiece is the most underrated song on the album. Another dramatised keyboard opener sets the tone for a classy track which is a real driving song. Gillans laid back vocals with harmonica alongside make this track a great one. Richie Blackmore's guitar sections are the ultimate technical perfection on this song. Finally though, we come to 'Space Truckin''. This is my favourite track on the album. The song has so much energy and fire. The grinding descending riff with bass is awesome and Gillan's growling vocals, with lyrics about completely random things such as 'Music In The Solar System' make this one a classic. Especially great is the instrumental section on the song where Ian Paice plays a mind-blowing drum solo; I'll say it again, he is the most underrated drummer of all time. What a song!<br /><br />'Machine Head' is a landmark album. Deep Purple completely refined their hard rocking, keyboard driven sound to come up with a collection of songs that really deliver. Best of all, the album is always enjoyable to listen to and you never get bored of the songs. Although it's not my favourite DP album, it is many ways, their most perfected work and shows the band at their peak. For any newbie to the band, get this album as it is a perfect introduction. Deep Purple are one of the most underrated bands of all time and they deserve much more respect than they get. Amazingly enough, this band are still together after 37 years (now into their 8th line-up) and are still producing great music (just look at their recent 'Rapture Of The Deep' album). Deep Purple are one of the greats and their music is influential, timeless and unbelievably memorable.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10f racing guitar sections from Blackmore.

B00003CXCT|5.0|The Films:<br /><br />Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope...<br /><br />A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a daydreaming farm boy named Luke Skywalker on the desert planet of Tatooine discovers a secret message in the memory banks of a small astromech droid called R2-D2. The tenacious little robot leads the young farmer and his golden protocol droid, C-3PO, to the home of a mysterious hermit who holds the secrets of Luke's past...and future. The hermit's name is Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he is a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan explains to Luke that he once fought alongside the boy's father, a long dead Jedi named Anakin Skywalker, that Anakin was killed by a dark and twisted former Jedi named Darth Vader, and that his hope was for Luke to carry on in the Jedi ways. Obi-Wan teaches Luke about the Force, an all-encompassing energy field created by life itself that gives the Jedi their seemingly supernatural abilities, from levitation to precognition, to incomparable speed and reflexes. The old Jedi also passes on to Luke the lightsaber of his father and teaches the boy to use the Jedi weapon, a sword of pure energy with the power to cut through nearly anything with the greatest of ease. Together, the aged Jedi, his new apprentice, and the two droids embark on a mission set forth by the message carried within R2-D2; a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan asking Obi-Wan Kenobi to deliver the astromech droid safely to her home planet, for he also carries the secret plans that could help the rebellion destroy the evil Emperor's greatest weapon, the Death Star.<br /><br />Hiring a seedy Corellian pilot named Han Solo and his copilot, Chewbacca the Wookie, to fly them to Alderaan in the starship freighter the Millennium Falcon, Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids are soon traveling through space at hyper-speed, doing their best to avoid the clutches of the evil Empire along the way. They shortly find themselves unwelcome guests in the lion's den, however, when their search for the now non-existent Alderaan lands them in the heart of the Death Star itself, a space station the size of a small moon with the fire power to destroy an entire planet with one laser blast! Together, the small band of heroes takes the opportunity to perform a dangerous rescue mission, saving the beautiful Princess Leia from the Emperor's vile henchman, Darth Vader, but not without first losing one of their own in the escape. It is now up to the remaining heroes and their princess to see the vital information within R2 is safely delivered to the rebel alliance, and that the Death Star is finally destroyed!<br /><br />Star Wars, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back...<br /><br />It is a dark time for the rebellion. Luke Skywalker and his friends have set up a new base on the ice planet of Hoth, but it is not long before their secret location is discovered by the evil Empire. After narrowly surviving an attack by a Wampa snow-beast, Luke and the rebels must flee the invading Imperial Forces, but not without putting up a fight first. What follows is a fantastic battle between snowspeeders and huge, 4-legged walking machines called AT-ATs, a necessary defensive in order to allow the large rebel transports to get away. In the mayhem of escape, however, the tight-knit group of friends, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, R2-D2, and of course Luke Skywalker, must divide. While struggling to survive in the harsh snow of Hoth, Luke had earlier received a visitation from the spirit of his old teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructing him to go to the Dagobah system and seek out a Jedi Master called Yoda to continue his training. With R2 as his co-pilot, Luke departs Hoth in his X-Wing Fighter for the mysterious destination, while Leia is forced to escape with Han, Chewie, and 3PO in the Millennium Falcon, a ride she is less than pleased to take.<br /><br />As Luke makes his way to the strange, swampy planet of Dagobah, Princess Leia fends off the romantic advances of intergalactic rogue Han Solo aboard the Falcon, Darth Vader in hot pursuit of their ship.  The Falcon's hyper-drive damaged, Han leads the Imperials into an asteroid field hoping the dangerous maneuver will cause them to give up chase, but when the asteroid cave they take up residence in displays a mind and appetite of its own, they are forced to come up with a new plan. Attaching their ship to the hull of Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, they manage to disappear from detection by the Imperial crew long enough to float away with the massive Destroyer's garbage discharge, but legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett is wise to their plan and informs the Empire of the Falcon's next destination, Cloud City. Meanwhile, Sith Lord Darth Vader holds conference with his dark master, the evil Emperor Palpatine, via holographic technology. Together, the two plot to recruit the son of Anakin Skywalker into their perverse household, or kill him if he refuses.<br /><br />On the eerie swamp planet of Dagobah, Luke Skywalker seeks out his new teacher in the ways of the Force, the elusive Master Yoda. What he finds is a small, green, inquisitive creature that offers to show him the way. Reluctantly, Luke follows the aged little alien, only to be baffled by the discovery that this creature is the Jedi Master himself. After some convincing by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda agrees to take on the padawan learner. Under his instruction, Luke begins to learn the intricacies of the Force, the differences between the dark and the light, and the mastery of his new, Force-given powers. Most importantly, Luke learns the dangers of being seduced by the Dark Side of the Force and the ease with which such a transformation can take place.<br /><br />As the Millennium Falcon reaches Cloud City, a beautiful, floating, gas-mining colony run by Han Solo's old friend, Lando Calrissian, they are greeted by some none-too-friendly security skiffs. This is no comfort to the already concerned little band of rebels, who are not exactly at ease about what sort of \\"friend\\" Lando Calrissian may turn out to be. Soon enough, old friends bid seemingly warm welcomes, and introductions are exchanged as well. Lando proves to be a charming diplomat of a scoundrel; as friendly as can be, but more concerned about numero uno than even Han Solo used to be, as the Falcon's crew will soon find out. For it is not long before they are also greeted by their old nemesis, Darth Vader. Han Solo is soon suffering under the Empire's vicious means of torture, all in an effort to lure Luke Skywalker into Vader's clutches by way of telepathically sensing his friend's anguish. And, it's not just Han's suffering Luke senses, but that of Leia as well, who is coming to terms with her true feelings for the Falcon's brave captain; and the suffering of  the wookie co-pilot Chewbacca, who has devoted his life to protecting his friend and partner, Han Solo. Luke is soon determined to join his friends on Cloud City, despite his training being incomplete. His teachers, Yoda and Obi-Wan, advise against the action, another unwise choice the padawan will have to live with and learn from after more than one failure during his training on Dagobah; and that's IF he survives this new mistake. By making his way to Cloud City in an attempt to help his friends, Luke is forcing an all too early confrontation with the Dark Lord of the Sith himself, Darth Vader!<br /><br />Star Wars, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi...<br /><br />While the evil Galactic Empire hastens construction on its new, second Death Star, Luke Skywalker's loyal droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, carryout their role in a rescue mission to retrieve their friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. As the two droids procure servants' positions in the slug-like Jabba's desert palace on Tatooine, Princess Leia Organa arrives in the guise of a bounty hunter named Bousch, Chewbacca the Wookie in tow as her supposed bounty.  Newest rebel recruit Lando Calrissian already in place and disguised as a palace guard, the stage is set for the final arrival, would-be Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, bringing with him the consequences of Jabba's refusal to be paid for Han Solo's freedom. However, before that happens, the plan is for Leia to free Han herself that night. The attempt is unsuccessful. While the princess does manage to free Han from his carbonite prison, Jabba and his cronies catch Leia in the act, and she soon finds herself clad in metal slave-girl garb and kept on the end of a leash at Jabba's side. Han, on the other hand, is locked away in the same dungeon cell his partner Chewbacca is being held in. The two share a bittersweet reunion. As day breaks again, Luke Skywalker arrives to take matters into his own hands, but his threats upon Jabba land him in the mobster's rancor pit, and he is forced to exterminate the great beast. This angers the Hutt intensely, and Luke and his crew are immediately sentenced to death by Sarlacc. The prisoners are loaded onto a skiff, and Jabba and his followers board a sail barge to the pit of the Sarlacc, sunken within the hot desert sands of Tatooine. As Luke Skywalker is prodded onto a plank over the deadly pit, an immense creature made of beak and tentacles eagerly waiting below, he offers Jabba one final chance to free the small group of rebels or pay the price of death. This amuses Jabba, but the death sentence stands. A signal to his loyal astromech droid, R2-D2, sends a lightsaber through the air and into the waiting hands of Luke Skywalker, who immediately takes action. As Leia strangles her massive Hutt captor with her slave chain, Luke and Lando battle the skiff guards and take back possession of their droids and friends Han and Chewie.<br /><br />Soon, the group of friends is back with the rebel alliance planning out their next course of action. All except for Luke, who has traveled back to the swamp planet of Dagobah with R2 in an attempt to finish the Jedi training he began there. It's a difficult reunion for the Jedi padawan. His master, Yoda, is on his deathbed, only waiting for this last chance to speak to Luke before giving himself up to the Force. For Luke, it's a time for closure on a subject that has eaten away at him since his battle with Darth Vader on Cloud City. Yoda confirms his darkest fears. Darth Vader IS Luke Skywalker's father, the once good and caring Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, seduced and corrupted by the wicked Emperor Palpatine decades ago. Yoda also informs Luke that only a final and successful confrontation with his father will make him a true Jedi Knight and stop the Emperor's reign of evil. Yoda passes away, his last breath revealing the secret of one other existing Skywalker child. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi arrives to console Luke as he emerges from Yoda's tiny home. It is Obi-Wan, Luke's first Jedi teacher, who helps reveal to Luke the secret identity of his unknown sibling and guides him to the right course of action.<br /><br />Luke and R2-D2 return to their friends and the Rebel Alliance in time to join General Han Solo's team on a mission to take out a shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. The shield it provides protects the Emperor's new Death Star, hanging high in the skies above.  As Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and the droids lead a small group of rebel soldiers on their special mission, General Lando Calrissian takes charge of a space battle to replicate the events of the battle of Yavin years earlier. When Solo's team takes down the Death Star's shield, Calrissian will lead the rebel fleet of fighters to the weakest spot of the Death Star to blow it up! With no small amount of uneasiness, Han volunteers his beloved Millennium Falcon for his good friend Lando to pilot on the maneuver, despite having a bad feeling that he'll never see \\"her\\" again. The groups go their separate ways, Han and the gang sneaking past Imperial security in a stolen Imperial shuttle.

Things go wrong from the get-go though, when the discovery of their team by Imperial biker scouts forces Luke and Leia into an exhilarating speeder-bike chase through the Endor forest. Luke makes his way back to the group, but Leia is lost. Luckily, she befriends a small, bear-like creature called Wicket W. Warrick, a young Ewok from the same tribe that soon captures Han, Luke, Chewie, and the Droids. Together again, Luke uses a bit of Force \\"magic\\" to convince the Ewoks to join the rebel forces in a thrilling woodland battle against the Empire's ground crew in a desperate effort to get the Death Star's shield down in time for Lando's assault on the deadly weapon. Luke has other issues on his mind also, however, and after revealing the truth to his long lost sibling, surrenders himself to Vader and the Emperor in the hopes of  finding the good that he still senses from deep beneath his father's twisted black shell. The future of the entire galaxy relies on the success of the Rebel Alliance in their separate goals, and it all culminates in the final act of \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" <br /> <br />The Legacy: <br /> <br />In 1977, young filmmaker George Lucas changed the lives of countless young movie-goers by delivering unto them \\"Star Wars,\\" a swashbuckling, sprawling space saga of rebellion, romance, and sorcery, in the style of the 1930s serials that inspired it, but with visual effects and imaginative characters the likes of which the world had never seen before! Starring newcomers Mark Hamill as naive and idealistic farm boy Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as dashing, fortune-seeking flyboy Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as beautiful damsel in distress Princess Leia, along with the unforgettable voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader and screen legend  Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, \\"Star Wars\\" spun a timeless tale of familiar myth and legend in a whole new way, relying on outstanding acting performances and an incomparable John Williams musical score to take viewers beyond the fantastic surroundings and into the story itself. Drawing inspiration from the annals of film history, borrowing heavily from \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" tales of King Arthur, and the works of Akira Kurosawa, not to mention the history of mankind in general, George Lucas's seemingly simple tale is so full of detail and realism, even in its most unbelievable moments, that the viewer easily becomes lost in the adventure. That's just what \\"Star Wars\\" is, an adventure; a thrill ride for the young at heart! <br /> <br />In 1980, the prayers of millions of \\"Star Wars\\" fans were answered with the release of a second Star Wars film, \\"Star Wars, Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back.\\" Continuing the spectacular story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, along with their wookie and robot friends, this was a much darker chapter in the epic Star Wars saga. It was a chapter of dark secrets, heart-wrenching devices, and a cliff-hanger ending that left many movie-goers with a feeling of, \\"What the *#@%??!\\" Nevertheless, it was a masterful piece of filmmaking that would go on to be called the best of the Star Wars saga by a multitude of Star Wars fans. Returning with the brilliant music of John Williams and the same outstanding cast as the first film, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Sir Alec Guinness, David Prowse, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and the voice of James Earl Jones, and introducing Billy Dee Williams in the role of Lando Calrissian and a new instant fan favorite bounty hunter character known as Boba Fett, plus the masterful puppeteering talents of Muppet legend Frank Oz, \\"Star Wars\\" creator George Lucas felt safe to turn over the reigns to seasoned director Irvin Kershner this time around. Taking on the job with intense respect and vigilance, Kershner's determination to create a worthy second act to the Star Wars saga resulted in cinematic excellence! A rousing adventure fantasy from beginning to cliff-hanger ending, loadedwith action, effects, suspense, drama, magnificent performances, and one of the most famous and believable screen romances in movie history, \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" took the Star Wars story to a whole new level, making it so much more than we ever thought it was before! <br /> <br />Then came 1983, and fans were flocking to theaters to see the 3rd and final film in the legendary Star Wars saga, \\"Star Wars, Episode 6: Return of the Jedi.\\" Completing the spectacular story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, and the malevolent Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, \\"Return of the Jedi\\" proved to be a very revealing final chapter in the Star Wars mythology. Old secrets were confirmed, new secrets revealed, bonds were strengthened, new ones were formed, the world said goodbye to some beloved characters both good and evil, and a band of tree-dwelling teddy bears proved that all the technology in the universe isn't enough to defeat the  \\"human\\" spirit! Of course, the main theme of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" is the main theme of Star Wars itself, redemption, but to delve too much into that just now would probably ruin the film for those who have not yet seen it. Returning yet again with the brilliance of John Williams and the same wonderful cast, George Lucas chose director Richard Marquand to helm the film this time around. The result was another cinematic masterpiece, though many fans may disagree due to a popular disdain for the lovable Ewok creatures. It's a distaste I still don't understand, but many folks simply don't like anything cute. I offer up this question though: In a galaxy as vast as that of \\"Star Wars,\\" wouldn't SOME of the creatures be cute? It's inevitable. The Ewoks serve a crucial purpose, regardless of the feelings of many fans. They embody one of George Lucas's major themes in Star Wars: The little guy can't be kept down! Anyway, I must not be the only Ewok lover. The characters enjoyed a popular cartoon series in the 80s (more popular than the \\"Droids\\" cartoon featuring R2 and 3PO), and had two quite enjoyable made for TV movies! \\"Return of the Jedi\\" is high on fun, being thoroughly action-packed and full of more bizarre creatures than any Star Wars film before it! It also introduces us to a character only seen before in holographic form (until the prequels came along, that is), the dark Emperor himself, played to fiendish perfection by Ian McDiarmid! And, yes, it's in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" that we see what's under Darth Vader's mask for the first time! This final chapter in the Star Wars trilogy is not to be missed by fans of the first two films! A rousing, enlightening, and astonishing experience from beginning to end! <br /> <br />In 1997, \\"The Star Wars Trilogy\\" was rereleased to theaters for a new generation. It was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions George Lucas had made to his film legacy. Through the magic of digital technology, special effects scenes were improved, deleted scenes were added with new digital characters, and the films were made to fall more in line with Lucas's original vision, which had been impossible to realize fully in the 1970s and `80s. George Lucas was happy. Many fans were not. However, many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them, if awkwardly. It was all a foreshadowing of what was to come. Now, the first three chapters of the \\"Star Wars Saga\\" have been released as well, and the tale is complete; no longer a simple tale about farm boy Luke Skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire, but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in Episode 6, \\"Return of the Jedi.\\"  <br /> <br />With the long awaited DVD release of the original, or \\"classic\\" Star Wars Trilogy came even more \\"improvements\\" from creator George Lucas, continuing his attempt to make the six Star Wars films fit together as one epic story. The most noticeable adjustment to thefirst film, \\"Episode 4: A New Hope,\\" in this reviewer's opinion anyway (all those complaints about the Greedo scene seem overblown to me, and I'm a huge Han fan), is the scene where Han Solo converses with Jabba the Hutt. First restored to the film with a digital Jabba in 1997, the DVD release offers a NEW Jabba in this scene; one that looks considerably more like the Jabba the Hutt we are all familiar with. While the new CGI Jabba still doesn't seem quite as harmonious with the rest of the picture as such digital characters do in the prequels, the whole scene is still quite an impressive feat and completely welcome as far as this fan is concerned, especially with the much needed update. Though, it kinda makes my action figure of 1997 Jabba pretty pointless. In the second Star Wars film, \\"Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back,\\" in addition to the previous changes, which enhanced the Wampa attack scene and opened up Cloud City to far more glorious views, the film now features changes to bring it more in line with the Star Wars prequels. Boba Fett's original voice has been replaced with the voice of Temuera Morrison, who played Jango Fett and the clones in the Star Wars prequels. Also, the scene where Darth Vader converses with the holo-projection of the Emperor has been redone with new dialogue and the replacement of Ian McDiarmid in the role of the evil Palpatine. In my personal opinion, the alterations that have been made to \\"Empire\\" over the years are more than welcome, especially to Cloud City, and while I feel for the actor who was replaced, bringing back Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor really ties the entire film series together quite nicely, as he played the Emperor in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" as well as in the prequels. In truth, it's a change I've always longed for! My only minor quibble is that replacing Boba Fett's voice seemed totally unnecessary, and I rather prefer his original sound. There's no reason to think that he wouldn't have lost his accent over the years after losing his father in Episode 2 at such a young age, and the original voice was far more menacing. As for the third film, \\"Episode 6: Return of the Jedi,\\" In addition to the '97 changes, which included an added musical number within Jabba's palace, improvements to the Sarlacc creature, and new cityscape celebrations and music in the film's finale,  \\"Return of the Jedi\\" now features changes to meld it better with the prequels also. Along with improving the overall look of the Rancor scene, the spirit of an aged Anakin Skywalker in the end of the film has been (quite shockingly) replaced with that of a much younger Anakin, circa Episode 3, played by actor Hayden Christensen. My honest response to the various changes to \\"Return of the Jedi\\" over the years: I'm not a huge fan of the added musical sequence. It seemed rather unnecessary and more cartoony than anything else in Star Wars. The only thing that bothers me more is the two-headed Podrace announcer in Episode 1. That bothered me MUCH more. Taking that into account, I am not extremely bothered by the musical number in Jedi, but it was better without it. I am rather pleased with the much needed adjustments to the Rancor scene, which was really just a matter of making the elements blend together much better than they did before. The Sarlacc changes are welcome by me too. It's definitely a more intimidating creature than it used to be when it was just a big hole in the ground with a few tentacles. As for the changes that relate more to tying the prequels to the original trilogy, the new elements, young Anakin's ghost and the cities of the galaxy in celebration, are excellent additions when one watches all six Star Wars films together. However, the original elements hold a place in all our hearts and this is why offering up the original films as a DVD option would have been so greatly appreciated. Still, over all, aside from only a few complaints here and there (particularly the digital removal of one of my favorite characters, Lak Sivrak, AKA the cantina wolf-man, another of my action figures that has been made obsolete!), I have no serious problems with the new SPECIAL special editions of the Star Wars saga. Though, as a hardcore fan, it does seem wrong that the original versions are not ALSO available on the DVDs (Disney gives the option on THEIR special editions, after all).  <br /> <br />Each film in the classic Star Wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option. \\"A New Hope\\" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. \\"Empire\\" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and director Irvin Kershner. \\"Jedi\\" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. The commentaries are enjoyable and can clue a viewer in on key elements, but they were clearly recorded separately, and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way, that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track. Nevertheless, a fun listen. Of course, all the really great extras are on the 4th disc in the DVD boxed set! Here, the highlight is the outstanding 150 minute documentary \\"Empire of Dreams,\\" an in-depth look at the making of all three classic Star Wars films. And, when I say in-depth, I MEAN in-depth! Fantastic program! The bonus disc also includes three enjoyable featurettes on the characters of Star Wars, the legacy of Star Wars, and the birth of the lightsaber. Other extras include still galleries, an Xbox game demo, a preview of \\"Star Wars, Episode 3,\\" and my favorite bonus features besides the documentary, the Trailers and TV spots. I absolutely LOVE the teaser trailers to the films, especially \\"A New Hope\\" and \\"Empire.\\" There's a powerful 1970s/80s sci-fi fantasy eeriness about them! I mean, they're creepy! Overall, not a bad bonus line-up, but don't let your hopes get too high. The bonus disc in the Star Wars trilogy set is painfully lacking deleted and alternate scenes, the classic Kenner toy commercials we grew up with (you know, \\"It's Lando Calrissian in disguise!\\"), AND the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. Then again, I guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but weren't. That was just MY wish list. We'll see what future DVD rereleases bring. Regardless, the \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" boxed set is a must own! Still three of the finest films ever made, still the same powerful experience (despite alterations), and still as thrilling as ever! \\"Empire\\" is still as eerily transcendental as ever, and, oh, do Leia's glossy lips look glorious in \\"A New Hope's\\" digitally restored and enhanced glory! You can keep your gold bondage Jedi bikini! Gimme young, glossy-lipped, cinnamon bun-headed princess perfection! Oh, and Ewoks still rule! If you like 'em in \\"Jedi,\\" pick up the Ewok Adventures double feature DVD! Now, let's hope those aforementioned \\"Ewoks\\" and \\"Droids\\" animated TV shows get some DVD season sets released soon too!
B000BGH22W|3.0|Though this soundtrack doesn't have the same magical qualities as the John Williams soundtracks, I thought that Doyle's work still did the job.  Just as any other soundtrack, it has its ups and downs, but I think, all in all, it was adequate.   <br /> <br />This film represents a transition from the old Harry Potter to the more mature, more graphic stories.  I think that another fanciful John Williams soundtrack would have been inappropriate for this change. <br /> <br />The action sequences were a little humdrum, but still appropriate.  Neville's waltz was particularly effective.  It played throughout the entire portion of the film during which the students (and teachers) were preparing for the dance, and the music created a soothing mood rather than playing on the awkwardness of the characters. <br /> <br />Overall, it was a good soundtrack, though not one likely to go down in history.
0060536357|2.0|I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.    The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.    There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.    I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|In BTVS, Joss Wheedon included a little truthtelling with his US Special Forces hero mind-kontrolled by milspec computer chip run amok on-purpose. In Serenity, Joss goes a step further with his MK-ULTRA plotline, with torturous mind-kontrol used on his fem fatal, as a government-made assassin, complete with trigger words for her handlers. This plotline needs to be investigated more by Hollywood, and Congress, and US courts. That's probably why Fox killed Firefly, for reasons of National Security. Just ask Cathy O'Brien. Truthteller Alex Jones of Infowars radio reported he enjoyed this movie, perhaps because he has interviewed so many real characters who lived that portion of Serenity's plot. Perhaps the most endearing aspect of Wheedon's BTVS/Angel and Firefly/Serenity are the background plot of psychopathic homicidal government run amok. No suspension of disbelief required.

0671027387|2.0|Dan Brown's second novel, Deception Point, is definitely better than the disastrous \\"Digital Fortress\\". But you can still see the flaws that the first novel suffered. He has found a better subject and tied in the multiple plots neatly. However his dialogs between the characters especially between the scientists are painfully shallow and the sarcasm is totally unnecessary. Unrealistic scientific and political events is another matter but can be bearable.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is argueably the best Madonna album to date. Madonna said she wants people to 'jump out of their seat' to this new album and it really makes you want to. A non-stop album takes you through a plethora of feel-good highs and makes you want to rush to the club, get the glitter ball cranked up and spin with your arms outstretched on the dance floor. Some very professional production from the likes of Stuart Price and Mirwais. whether you like disco, dance, techno or something old school and groovy then all of your tastes are catered for. Buy it for someone for xmas and they will love you for it!  <br />
0312995423|1.0|If you want to observe the development of a writer, read this novel. I have enjoyed the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\". But this first novel is so bad that you can't even compare. And I am not actually talking about factual and technical errors. The style of the writing and the dialogs between the characters are very amouterish. I am surprised that this got even being published.<br />Aside making a lot of money from the coattails of his later work I am certain that Dan Brown wishes he had never written this one.

0380789035|2.0|I'm not sure what I expected when I picked up this book, but after all the ranting and slavering from gaiman fans, I at least expected it to be entertaining and possibly interesting.  I thought that I didn't have unreasonable expectations for this novel, but sadly they were too high for the experience.<br /><br />Let me put it in perspective for you and save you a few hundred pages of boredom:<br /><br />- characters superficial, non-interesting, and only rarely had something clever to say.<br /><br />- a lot of gradual buildup to go nowhere.  where is my act III, mister gaiman?<br /><br />seriously.  if you're looking for some gothy angsty gods and depressed misanthrope protagonists, go read some buffy the vampire slayer fan fiction or something and save yourself the cover price.  This book doesn't have any surprises in it, but does have a few places in the country that fans of the author can road trip to and fornicate on.  That's the silver lining to this snoozefest.
B000002AGN|5.0|I can count the jazz CDs that are more significant than this on one hand. Utterly staggering.
B0000085N4|4.0|How can you ever hope to follow up a masterpiece like Electric? That was one of the all time best hard rock albums ever, easily the best Cult album ever. So how did The Cult follow up their milestone of an album, with another amazing album. While Sonice Temple might not have as many classics as Electric and not all the songs are as good as on Electric Sonic Temple is still one of the very best hard rock/heavy metal albums to come out of the 1980's.<br /><br />The Cult is one of those bands that to me can't totaly be placed into one catagory or genra. Their style is early 1980's New Wave meets heavy metal of the 1970's and the result of those two styles is one very good rock band. Ian Astburys voice is something of Glen Danzig meets Jim Morrison of the legendary Doors, and the mans voice is nothing short of amazing. Billy Duffy's guitar playing is always amazing, the man is truly one of the most underrated musicians/song wrighters of all time. Jamie Stewart is also one hell of a bass player. Most of the songs by The Cult would be lost without his playing. The whats more impressive about this band is that they have no drummer! Yeah you read correct no drummer, crazy huh?<br /><br />Sonic Temple is full of guitar driven bluesy hard rock. 'Fire Woman' is one of the bands all time best songs, and it has one of their best chorus' as well. 'American Horse' is a  song that was never released as a single but should have been because it would have easily been a massive rock hit. The albums big single 'Sweet Soul Sister' was not only one of the bands biggest hits if not the biggest but it is also one of the bands best songs period. The chorus is great, nice vocals, killer guitar solo by Duffy and the lyrics are perfect, I just cant beleave a band from England wrote a song the sounds so L.A. The only song on this album that I think I could have dont without is 'Edie (Ciao Baby)' because I just dont think the song is that good and it doest really fit in with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Sonic Temple is to The Cult as Goats Head Soup is to The Rolling Stones. The both came out after the bands biggest and best albums so they sometimes get bad reps, more so Goats Head Soup but the point is this is not an album you can measure to Electric it has to be appreciated as its own excelent album, and excelent it is!album. <br /> <br />Sonic Temple is to The Cult as Goats Head Soup is to The Rolling Stones.

0767836324|5.0|This has always been a favorite movie of mine and I just finished watching it last night. Hoffman and WIlliams give a stunning performance as the classic duo of Pan and Hook. The story flows well, fits into the original great, and even reminds us of classic elements from the REAL Peter Pan.     After finally leaving Neverland, perhaps forever, Peter finally does grow up. He becomes a lawyer and marries WEndy's granddaughter. After having two children and spending nearly thrity years away from his childhood home, Peter has forgotten nearly all about his past and nemesis Hook. Instead, he has become ubsessessed with work and often forgets about his family and what is really important. He's even afraid of heights!     After returning to England from America, Peter has come to visit the aged Granny WEndy. ANd while they are away at a dinner to dedicate a hospital wing just to Wendy, Peter's two children are kidnapped. With a little help from Tinker Bell, The lost boys, and even Hook, Peter has to remember who he really is and what is really important before he loses everything forever.     SPielberg brings us this masterful tale in gorgeous fashion and surprising technology for the period this was filmed. Robin William's gives one of his best performances as the boy who was supposed to never grow old.      Overall, the story is marvelous. Great fun for all ages!

B000B8QF00|5.0|first off this isnt a review since i dont own the cd because i'm waiting for the cd/dvd version instead but since it contains 95% songs i love i gave it a 5.  :P <br /> <br />now i'm not trying to start crap or anything but that person who posted about alanis not touring and not caring obviously hasnt followed her career much.  <br /> <br />she released a new album just a little over a year ago and they're complaining about the lack of new material? not to mention its already been announced that a new album is coming in 2006 anyway....but yeah because she releases an anniversary album and a greatest hits in one year it equals her not caring or anything?  10yrs is a big deal in music, not many artists last it much less last and constantly outdo themselves (thats of course my personal opinion but..lol) and releasing an album to commemorate her breakthrough and then another album to commemorate her career is far from lazy. the hardcore fans probably already have or at least have heard every song on the greatest hits but for the regular fans, the regular folk...The Collection is a great gift that contains many songs they probably never even heard. and to compare her to Hootie? that's just incredibly laughable....they have one major album then disappeared for 10yrs while she's constantly released new material and/or made contributions to other people's albums and soundtracks... and while none of it may have had the commercial success or popularity of Jagged, she's still never stopped...so thats a very bad comparaison... <br /> <br />then as far as touring is concerned, she's constantly doing festivals and shows and appearances if not full blown tours, every cd released (down to even feast on scraps)has been followed or preceeded by some kinda tour...i can only assume that this \\"kid reviewer\\" lives in north america and doesnt follow her career much because i have noticed many of the smaller tours stick to europe and that part of the world..so maybe this kid thinks she doesnt tour much simply because she doesnt show up in or near their city/town that often....but take it from me, i live in Ottawa(her hometown) and she's only done 4 concerts here but even i know how busy her touring schedual is....she may not visit north america every time but she's far from someone who barely tours....i mean she even toured this summer to promote the acoustic Jagged... <br /> <br />so yeah before complaining about something, check on your \\"facts\\"...and at the risk of sounding rude or something, if you're going to judge her as an artist based on mainstream success and popularity...you shouldn't even bother being a fan because i'm sure if you were to ask fans to list their favorite songs of hers, a good 90% would be songs that were never released as singles if even released at all.... <br /> <br />anyway i'm sorry to write something that isn't a review in a review section but i had to say this, couldn't hold back...lol <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is a really great album - make no mistake. This is Madonna back to the kind of material that she is so perfect for. After the rather dissapointing \\"American Life\\" she is back on top form with this excellent album. \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" is an out-and-out dance record - no sloppy ballads, just track after track of killer samples and steller beats. <br /> <br />That's why this album works so well - it's just a wonderfully crafted dance album where every tune is catchy as the last. Some great lyrics can be found deep within the maze of hooks and beats, too. Stand out tracks include \\"Get Together\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\" and \\"Sorry\\" but there isn't a bad track to be found here. This is a truly masterful record that could well be responsible for a big return to form of dance and house music. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a must have of 2005 and a hugely triumphant return to the top for the one and only Madonna.  <br /> <br />
0446608955|5.0|I am 13 years old, and I saw the movie BEFORE I read the book. After the movie ended, I replayed it again, I loved it. I knew I had to read the book. Landon is a punk, but changes because of Jaime. He becomes a true romantic. I read the book about 5 times, in a row. And then I watched the movie in a whole new perspective. I absolutely love this book, it is by far my favorite one. Although I enjoyed the Notebook and the Wedding, neither grabbed me as much as this. Probably because I could relate to the characters much more. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially if you love a sad/happy romance.
B0002X314C|5.0|Upon hearing this cd, the first thing that pop into my head was..\\"I want John Legend to sing 'So High' to me!!!\\"  One of those CD's that you can just let play, without skipping, and let it repeat.  Doesn't get old.  I can see myself 10 years from now poppin in that CD saying \\"Oh, that's my jam\\".  That's saying a lot because I dont really listen to slow music but his CD is just so mellow and calming...well, hey...GO BUY IT!
B0000062FN|5.0|If you are new to Santana, looking for the best Santana album, or recently became a fan due to the success of Supernatural and Shaman, Santana III is the album you are looking for.  This is the last album of the Woodstock-era line-up.  Gregg Rolie on keyboards and vocals, David Brown on bass, Michael Shrieve on drums, Michael Carabello on conga, Jose \\"Chepito\\" Areas on timbales and conga, and Carlos Santana and the newly acquired Neal Schon on guitars.  There is not a dull spot throughout the whole album. <br />      1.Batuka- This track starts off the album with a BANG!  You know Santana means business when you first start hearing the song.  A very rythmical instrumental that will get you off your feet and start moving. <br />      2.No One To Depend On- This is the album's most memorable track.  Santana does not sound better than this.  Congas are pounding, guitars are wailing, there is so much colors and life going on in this song, you won't know what hit you. <br />      3.Taboo- Very good piece of music.  It has a more Modern feel to it. The guitar solo at the end by Neal Schon and Carlos Santana is mesmerizing. <br />      4.Toussaint L'Overture- A true Santana classic. This song makes you want to get up and dance. Gregg Rolie kills the Hammond organ, Neal Schon makes mincemeat out of his guitar,  Michael Carabello attacks the congas, and Chepito Areas makes the timbales beg for mercy.  <br />      5.Everybody's Everything- This is the album's most radio friendly and biggest commercial success. The Tower of Power gives this song that \\"Feel Good\\" feeling. <br />      6.Guajira- A great party song (if you are latino). This song was a HUGE success in latin america. <br />      7.Jungle Strut- Carlos and Neal go half-and-half on guitar duties in this song. Gregg Rolie joins them on organ to make an extremely good song. <br />      8.Everything's Coming our Way- This song sounds like something out of Caravanserai. It's another \\"Feel Good\\" song. <br />      9.Para Los Rumberos- The album starts off with a bang, and it ends with an even bigger one! After relaxing on Everything's Comig Our Way, this song punches you in the face with towering percussion and a great rythm. Tito Puente knew what he was doing when he wrote this song. <br />    Although the band would soon see the first of many personell changes, they still managed to make one more #1, Platinum album together. Caravanserai, another platinum album, would be soon to follow, but Santana never surpassed it's peak, Santana III.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I really do like it (and I do actually own a copy), but the only real reason for me writing this review is to tell everyone to ignor any reviews from \\"fred dursts numba one fan\\".  Besides the fact that people who don't have the intellect to speak normal (intelligent) english piss me off, but he categorized linkin park as death metal. wtf?!? Dude, if you can't tell those posers appart from actual metal, you ought to stick to your preppy (c)rap.  There is no musical talent in the hip-hop style whatsoever!  I will not even shame the world of music by calling it a genra, because it's nothing but some moron ghetto wanna-be \\"gangsta\\" talking (not singing, or any other related vocals, such as those found in real death metal)over COMPUTERIZED drum and bass beats.  Now, depending on if you metal heads have an open mind about your music, this was a very good c.d. and I honestly am gald that I bought it.  My last comment to \\"fred dursts numba one fan\\" and to \\"50 cent\\", \\"lil' john\\", and especally \\"eminem\\": SHUT UP ALREADY!! NONE OF YOU HAVE ANY TALENT!!! <br /> <br />Lastly, I'd like to thank the rest of you reading this for listening to me rant, and I really hope you follow my advice, or at least don't be another ignorant jerk who writes reviews without the silghtest clue of what music is. <br /> <br />P.S.: If you want to hear GOOD Hardcore, Thrash, Death, Symphonic, (ect.) metal, just look or ask around. It's not very hard to find something you'll enjoy from the aforementioned categories.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I am not a Country Western music fan.  Not even a Johnny Cash fan.  But the minute I got home from accompanying my husband to see this movie, I called my Johnny-June-loving-Southern bred Mom and told her to GO SEE THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />I have a new respect for \\"J.R.\\" Cash.  It's o.k. it wasn't a biographical story.  It had just enough of everything to make it a wonderful movie.  A story, that's what it was.  A story of a guy and a girl in love for many, many years and the stuggles they encountered.  And even more, the struggles Johnny encountered, including his demons.<br /><br />Take the time, it's a great family movie.  Not for young ones.  There's a lot about drug abuse and lots of drinking.  But for older kids and even your parents...take them and enjoy.<br /><br />If these two wonderful actors are not nominated for Academy Awards...there's something wrong with the system!!!

How could he have such rotten offspring? <br /> <br />Poor old dad and his inventions - they never seemed to work. <br />Loved mom's methods of getting rid of the Gremlins even though she didn't know what she was fighting. <br /> <br />What a come down for the Gremlins after the theater scene - poor old Stripes was all alone. <br /> <br />The scenery was beautiful but seemed like everything was frosted not just snowed upon. <br />Loved the ride-a-chair up the stairwell - would have liked to have seen more of that house. <br /> <br />Characters were great - even the dumb cops.  <br />Wonderful entertainment.
0060931736|5.0|My first encounter with Jean Brodie came via Maggie Smith's very memorable performance in the 1960s film of the same name--a very fine film indeed.  But those who come to Muriel Sparks' novel through the film are in for quite a surprise: although the basic characters and the story itself are recognizable, the tone is quite different and the novel works to a greatly different point.<br /><br />In a general sense, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE is a portrait of a place, Edinburgh of the 1930s, a particular time, an era in which women were dominated by strict codes of behavior.  Those who did not conform these codes were on a collision course with society, and so it is with Miss Jean Brodie, school teacher at the conservative Marsha Blaine School For Girls.  A pseudo-intellectual with a sensual disposition, Miss Brodie sets out to visit her own ambitions on the next generation--and with very mixed results.<br /><br />The next generation in question is a particular group of girls who fall into Miss Brodie's hands through the school, a group that quickly becomes known as \\"the Brodie set\\" and are noted for their excessive loyalty to her and to her romantically inclined attitudes to life.  But Miss Brodie has erred: for all her claim to special insight, she is largely oblivious to the true nature of their characters, and while she has an undeniable impact on their lives it is not precisely the impact she seeks or expects.<br /><br />There are no suddenly plot twists, no great turns in the novel in any dramatic sense; instead, the book is about the revelation of character that can only occur with time.  Miss Brodie first appears as a fascinating figure, but as her students grow to maturity and perceive her in new and different lights our own impression of her changes.  Is she, as one student says near the end of the novel, \\"a silly woman,\\" a woman of false emotion and half-thought-out ideas, a Scottish Madame Bovary?  And what of the children in her care, whose lives take such unexpected (and, to Miss Brodie, often undesirable) paths when they leave her behind?  Are they really the \\"Creme de la Creme\\" after all?<br /><br />Sparks presents her story in what might be called layers of time, allowing us to see past, present, and future all at once; it is a remarkable bit of writing, alternately smooth and sharp, sweet and bitter, and all to surprising effect.  At the same time the novel is concise, condensing a great deal into the fewest pages possible.  A quick read, yes, but one that most will find unexpectedly demanding.<br /><br />In the end, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE is about character and how it is shaped by ourselves, by others, and by our various circumstances--and how we either accept or rebell against that impact.  Although THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE is frequently offered in high school and early college literature courses, I personally do not feel it will have much relevance for any one much under the age of 40; it is the sort of novel that requires the reader to bring considerable life-experience of their own to the tale, and without it book may seem shapeless and trivial.  It is very much an adult's book and should be approached with that fact clearly in mind.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerake such unexpected (and, to Miss Brodie, often undesirable) paths when they leave her behind?

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's best overall CD second to Ray Of Light - Best Dance CD in a long time. Beginning to end, every cut is great.     IF THIS CD DOESN'T MAKE YOU MOVE, HAVE SOMEONE HOLD A MIRRORBALL UNDER YOUR NOSE - YOU'RE DEAD!    Everything old is new again. As usual, looking like a trendsetter by following the newest trends before they become mainstream, this CD is confirmation that trance is finally waning. Sure, it's  a combination of Madonna repeating herself and 70's disco samples, but you won't care.     YOU WILL JUMP TO YOUR FEET AND DANCE!!!      \\"Push\\" pumps a sultry, irresistable beat. The rest is exceptional, slammin' dance. Pure energy. Kicks butt.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The queen of pop is back with her brand new album, Confessions On A Dance Floor!<br /><br />After the commercial disapointment of American Life (still a #1 record, still selling 5 million copies all over the world, still with a Top 10 hit, a top 40 hit & 4 Dance #1's), Madonna delves into her past to change our future.<br /><br />By \\"returning\\" to her roots with her first all dance album since she first started on the scene 22 years ago, \\"Confessions...\\" is an amazing album from start to finish!<br /><br />From the retro disco \\"Hung Up\\" that we've all heard by now, to the trance-y \\"Forbidden Love\\" and the super catchy \\"Jump\\", this album is pure dance all the time.<br /><br />Some clubs have been playing the album from start to finish, unheard of in this ADD music world.<br /><br />Even the tounge in cheek \\"I Love New York\\" brings back the cheeky, campy Madonna of the 80's.<br /><br />\\"Confessions...\\" has been named one of the years best by many critics (Amazon included) and there's a reason for it: The Queen Of Pop got even better.
B00005JO17|4.0|I loved the film and the message..My daughter who is 26 loved it also. <br />I plan on taking my grandson who is 9 , only I want to see the 3-D version this time around. <br />With the film title, and knowing the story of chicken little I was not expecting Laurence of Arabia, so I was not dissapointed. <br />Plot is simple but it is still a cute film and from what I hear from others , see it in 3-D..
B000B8QEZG|1.0|After hearing all the hype about Madonna's return to her classic disco style, I awaited this album's release with eager anticipation. I could not be more disappointed. This album is just as bad, or worse than \\"American Life\\". It contains only three good songs: \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Jump\\". All three are upbeat disco songs slightly reminiscent of the \\"pre Kabala\\" Madonna.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a litany of mediocre songs with poor beats. Most disappointing of all are her lyrics. Again, we see the Madonna who burdens her listeners with her petty preaching about what a horrible person she once was, versus how \\"enlightened\\" she is now. (\\"How High\\" is especially cumbersome.)<br /><br />Some of the songs like \\"I Love New York\\" and \\"Issac\\", are just plain ridiculous. In \\"I love New York\\", she actually says \\"I love New York, other cities make me feel like a dork.\\" I kid you not. \\"Issac\\" is basically a man who sounds like he is moaning something from a mosque, which Madonna set to a run of the mill beat.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and download \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Jump\\" from Napster for $3 and let the rest of the album rest in peace. I believe it is official now, there will be no resurrection of the old Madonna. I suppose all good things must end.
