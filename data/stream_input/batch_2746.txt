B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is incredible - this series just keeps getting better.  Can't wait for season 4 to start in October.  Go ahead and get the season as you'll end up ordering all the episodes anyway.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You can take out other Minions and Defeat Vector. Love those bananas and jumping minions. Cute game for kids. Just Love it.
B000002L9W|5.0|David lee roth can do no wrong..this album is great! Worth the price just for the song \\"Crazy From The Heat\\" Great cover of \\"Thats Life\\" on here too! If you are a David Lee Roth fan this album is a must have! Also check out his book Crazy from the Heat...its hilarious! The cd came as specified...I would def buy from this seller again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can slay creepers, kill spiders and zombies. You can own skeletons. Great entertainment for Boys. Total distraction to parents and others around them.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|All I can say is, &#34;DON'T MISS THIS FILM!&#34;  I saw it first at a file festival; and immediately started looking for a DVD.  I simply had to have it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Internet connected TV devices have always failed because they rely on a 20+ year old device to navigate, the remote control. Google has just eliminated that step in a big way with the Chromecast. Choose your content, click a button, and boom! My TV turns on, switches to the correct input and plays my content. It doesn't get any more simpler or better than this folks.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great book! It is something everyone should read. I learned so much from this book! The biggest surprise at the end was how much work she put into it to verify all of the details so that all of the information presented is correct!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I really liked this movie.  We have watched it over and over and over.  I like that she isn't helpless although she is idealistic.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Apparently killing, shooting, and eating people is okay by them.<br />But show one scared chipmunk or hungry hyena (understating slightly) and this movie will upset the sensitivities of 13 year old girls.<br />If they could just sell the zoo scenes at the beginning as a continuously looping movie I and many others would probably buy it.<br /><br />Great beautiful 3d movie, especially if your goal is to have young girls flee crying.<br /><br />and did you notice Adult \\"Piscine\\" is also the police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire?
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My kids saw this at a friend's home and said that it was really good.  We have watched it several times.
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|I was impressed with the 3D at times, but munchins and fairer-folk just liked the singing and cute animals and I don't think 3D mattered to them much comparatively. So.... I chalk that up to fun for all types right?
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|The first time I watched it one of the people I watched it with gave away the scenes.  After watching it 2 more times, I have noticed that it seems that people can't help giving it away.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I found this book to be inspirational!!<br />THE power we have to make our lives and our families life better.<br />LOVE is the answer! And God!
B004PGAQMW|5.0|My favorite part is that he calls Metro City - metrousity.  Our family really likes it  even mid teens - although they'd probably never admit it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very easy to use, great features, reliable, and doesn't scare you awake! This is a great alarm clock, way better then my phone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this!  Ready for more levels.  Good game for us older people that are not really fast or have good hand eye coordination.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Don't usually have time for appointment television.  I'm glad this was on Prime and I was bored.  Great great show.  High power smart ass lawyer.  Smart ass crook.  High jinks.  Also Donna and Rachel are not hideous.  Do yourself a favor and start watching one of the best shows on TV.  Well written to boot.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I waited to see this on demand for free and it made me laugh so hard, I was crying, I was snorting, I think my friend's thought that they needed to call an ambulance for me.  I wasn't in a girls acapella group, but I did do chorus and it does get stressful at times when you compete, this totally brought me back to HS. FAT AMY is Hilarious! I truly enjoyed this movie that I bought it, so I can laugh like that all the time.  If you just want to laugh at something dumb then get this movie and root for the under dogs!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|ervy thing is good but y they give you limits huh am i right and only 15 minuts?  I perfer some stuff not to be ther then limated time
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver have always been my favorite.  He always gets out of trouble and always gets the ladies. It was nice to see episodes back to back without commercials.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph was a great movie for any age and gender. Adorably hilarious. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Enjoyed all three very much. Love the characterization, and the descriptions of the cold in Sweden almost made me shiver.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|All of the useful content is gone. It's like they decided to go to Weather for children or people who only care about the current conditions.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|It's good to have on this device if only I would have known. It makes my kindle so much more fun.<br /><br />Thanks

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved it....it was the quickest I had read a book in a long time...kept picking it up to find out what the next twist and turn was.....
B000IKQMFO|5.0|We like this movie for its depiction of the upstairs, downstairs way of life. Great performances, good story, and directed by Robert Altman. What else do you need?
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|It had it's slow parts,  but had great scenes too, especially during the actually Tsunami floods.  Well worth watching for sure!
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|Not impressed. Acting is OK but story lines are not so hot. Don't watch it with your kids--no matter how old they are.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is very good and I would highly recommend it to anybody that needs a good weather forecast before heading out in the weather!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Skipped a lot of details to point to the plot points. Sometimes it left me thinking this book was a skeleton but an easy read for a exciting adventure. I liked it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|If you are looking for a back pack that is cheap and good, this is the one. I don't have much to say, but good.
B008J344BQ|5.0|Love Pink! Her lyrics are always original and a mirror of life though we hate to admit it.  Another winner for her.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A really good game. Really helps hone your observational skills. A great way to kill a few hours. If you like games that challenge your ability to problem solve, you should definitely give this game a try.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is an amazing game for every on kid all the way to adults I think it was realty fun and I will keep playing it unlike my other games I have but I don't play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good addictive I am glad I got it<br />You should get it<br />You will love it too<br />GET IT
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One of the best games I've played on my kindle,it's a challenge every day. Easy  to use,better than hand held games. Would recommend for anyone.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This Uno app is Loads of fun! 4 stars for me!  I hope you enjoy the app as well.<br /><br />Have a great day!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I loved playing this game with family and friends. I have an aunt who use to catch us off guard and deal us one card and tell us to draw two and yell uno.
B001G93Z60|5.0|This CD is all I expected from Anastasia.I chose this CD because I love her voice and the title song is in a Jazzersice set.The routine is upbeat and singing makes the workout more fun.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I bought this for my 3yr old grandson who absolutely loved this movie. It's full of music, laughs and fun. Just<br />as I remember when my kids were little. A true classic!!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a great WW2 weapon sim but it needs more guns like the MP-40, Colt, 50.  cal, Bazooka, PPSH, Mosin Nagant, Springfield, Panzershreck, Grewer, SVT, MG 42, FG 42, and the M1 Carbine.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|great and scary movie. my grandsons said this is their favorite movie of all time. they loved this creepy movie
B0063GORYU|4.0|It keeps your mind alert, and you don't win every time. Each hand is different, and as many times that you play, you are trying to beat the computer.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|When I first ordered this case, I did not realize it was not merely a carrying case, but also a charging case. This is brilliant, since one of my main problems with my Bluetooth headset was that it would run out of batteries during my very busy days. The other problem I was having was damaging my headset by shoving it into my pocket when I was not using it. In one fell swoop, for $30, this product allowed me to solve both issues. I love it, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a voyager Legend Bluetooth headset.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank you so much! This product worked great plus I got it for free because my other one wasnt working!:)
B007SPPANM|3.0|I was always stricken with grief when I saw this movie. I owned it on vhs and decided to buy it on dvd. it is a sad story. The love between kate winslett and Leonardo decaprio was of course not a real part of the story but added an even more sad effect to the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kindle is way better than the cell phone in terms of screen size but I'm still waiting for the 3rd run to make it to Amazon and of course the special limited edition costumes...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Spending down time with Downton is terrific!  We're enjoying every moment. Using Amazon Prime to watch the episodes is easy.
0307749347|5.0|Sharing the audio with my team at work and family members to help us find the happiness that we all are looking for.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I went in with no expectations so I wouldn't be disappointed...<br /><br />It gives the tip of the hat to some staple things from the original while being its own thing.  Keep watching until the credits end....you're welcome.
0547884591|5.0|Tim has done it again.  This book is amazing.<br />The cooking tips are very practical and his meta-learning discussion is priceless.
B000JCQCW4|3.0|I mean it doesn't have much of a wow factor to it...predictable actually if you read much.  Replay value is iffy...
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Consistently well done, classic comedy show.  Cast and writers deliver great episodes season after season.  Looking forward to more from this crew.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book spent more time on his sky diving adventures, and his family's time at his bedside than it did on his actual experience. I for one believe his experience was no more than a vivid dream. After 75% of a 209 page book it's over, the rest is all appendix and thank you's...Save your money
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh. Wow. I'd put off reading this due to all the good reviews I've read cause I was really afraid of being disappointed.  Not the case, so loved this!  Now I MUST get Holders story.  Bravo Colleen!
B0000035E7|5.0|Released in 1989,this was Nirvana's debut album,on the indie label,Sub Pop records. This has some of the best songs that Kurt has ever written. It includes my personal favorite Nirvana song \\"About A Girl\\",which made me an instant fan of the band and of Kurt. \\"Bleach\\",unfortunatly was always a very underrated album. Mostly due to the fact that it was an indie release,and was before Nirvana went mainstream with the likes of \\"Nevermind\\"(1991) and \\"In Utero\\"(1993). I would say \\"Bleach\\" is a million times better than either of those albums...just my opinion though. Overall,if you are a Nirvana fan and never took the time to listen to \\"Bleach\\"...then I highly recommend that you do.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Characters develop quickly while drawing you into the ever developing story line. Funny, smart and well written. Looking forward to season 3. Can't wait!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game iplay it every day just wish we got more chips without having to spend real money to get them.
B00D2BHO44|4.0|For a fantastic game. Although, a bit disappointed that the music from the intro menu is not part of the tracks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's amazing how addicting this game became. I showed it  to a coworker and she and her husband haven't stopped playing it, just like myself. This is a 5 star all the way.
0061703087|5.0|I disagree with the naysayers. I think this was one of Crichton's better efforts. It was certainly better than Next, a book I also recently read. One aspect that added power to the story is the fact that this nano-technology is actually advancing and may produce such nano machines within our lifetimes. It is genuinely scary to contemplate what could happen if these machines were to merge in some  manner and begin sharing predatory information. This is not completely unrealistic in view of the fact that the military would without doubt take a hard look at nano machines as methods of undercover attack during time of war. All that would be required would be for some of these machines to go a bit haywire and begin attacking humans indiscriminately. Compared to Crichton's Next, I thought this was more fearfully realistic. This is a keeper.
067942850X|4.0|Amazing book, hard cover and a really good complement for the move I saw before. I would recommend it definitely!
B00005JNX0|5.0|Madagascar is a hilarious and fun animated film. I love this film as well as the 3rd one a lot.<br /><br />The film is about a sweet, friendly, and narcissistic lion named Alex and his group of friends. Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria all perform shows in New York City for the public. One day, Marty feels tired of performing all the time, and he wishes he could go to the wild. Alex tries to cheer him up, but it doesn't work. The next morning, Marty takes off to walk around the city, this leads to some crazy antics. Afterward, they all get tranquilized and somehow shipped to Madagascar. When they wake up, they are all freaked out to be there. They then meet a tribe of Lemurs led by King Julian. As they live there for several days, Alex's wild lion behavior begins to come out since he hasn't eaten meat in days. The rest of the film is about Marty trying to help Alex, and for them to find a way to return back home to New York.<br /><br />The film is packed with sexual jokes and jokes that only adults will understand. I view this more as an adult animated film, but that's just me.<br /><br />I love this movie a lot and it is hysterically funny. I totally recommend it.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|I find this game addicting, but we encounter tons of problems. The game gives you hints you don't need while your trying to look for a pair of jewels. They also don't give you enough time to actually get tons of points. Also, this game should stop showing unnecessary ads, and I CAN'T EVEN FIND A WAY TO TURN THE ADS OFF!!! This game would be awesome to the core if these problems didn't exist.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|I wish I had selected a watch with a dark face. Glancing to tell time is distracting with a white face and white minute and hour hands
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Actually, this game is one of the best games I have ever purchased. Whenever I try to open it, It freezes on me. Seriously, I need to get to Level 50 and get every title in this game, but I can't because it freezes on me. Whenever I could play this game, I always ended up getting a lot of points. But that is nowhere near possible now.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|Not the best tripod out there . Unstable In many positions but for a few bucks what do you expect .
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This item arrived exactly on time. Not only that but with this concert on blue ray it really feels like you are there!! This was the best gift for my boyfriend to celebrate our new 60 inch vizio!
B001GA1RFA|2.0|Not nearly as good as his other books. I lost interest and did not finish it. May try again another time.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I like this app. Its good for meeting new friends specifically in my area. Lets u also search other areas. Anonymous chat is nice for when youre bored and it tells u when someone views or is a mutual match.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am a very big reader so I do not say this lightly, but this is one of the best books I have ever read!<br /><br />The socio-political aspects of this book were astounding.  Without giving too much away, this was not your typical zombie book.  it really gave a realistic point of view if this were to ever happen to us.  What would we do?  How would we rebuild?  What would everyone from common people to the world leaders do?  How would this effect economics?  All of these questions were answered as well as what the emotional toll would be on the people of the world.  There are so many voices and layers to this book.  it is by far, one of the most powerful books I have ever read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like the game. It has some visualizations that match what you would expect of a Starwars themed game and it still has the Angry Birds theme as well. The best of both worlds. :-) It's fun to play, has different scenarios than other Angry Birds games; such as bubbles out in space that you have to boomerang around, and light sabers that you can use to slice through things. All in all a fun way to waste time and procrastinate.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Origonally this was easy to use. Now it is terrible and I have delisted it. v &larr; Touch again to save
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like the ability to view. Weather very quickly and not to wait for the pictures for any length of time.
B0055OK2T0|2.0|What can I say that  is not already in the subject line. boring, predictable, urbane, typical, hardly any content, hardly any character development... I'm sure the book was better....
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I chose this book because as a teacher I was aware the author won the Newbery Medal a few years back, so I thought I'd give this popular novel a try.  Admittedly, I do not enjoy fantasy, so I struggled with this one!  Fairies and flying gray rags are not my cup of tea!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|After season 1, we couldn't wait to watch more.  Thankfully, Season 2 was ready to watch on Amazon.  Now we are waiting for Season 3.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Captivating Drama With Amazing Decor And Enjoyable There is So Much Going On In All The Seasons that You To Watch ThE One Before To Understand The Next.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|We loved watching this series with our 13 yo daughter and 11 yo son.  Continued watching Season 2 and can't wait for season 3, or 4 (hopefully).
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|Mavis Staples began her career as a great artist great and much like a fine wine she has improved with age.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Not a great book for this series.  It loosely tied up some loose ends but for me I had hoped for more in an ending.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is a classic kids movie, that adults and children should love. It has clean, good humor, good lessons, and a great story line. And unlike other kids movies, there is great character development and plot lines. It's a keeper.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got this for my 10 year old Grandson. He really enjoys finding all the clues and solving the puzzle. Need more than 10 levels.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|This is good for younger kids because it is easy for them to identify the shapes.  My Grandson loves to play this game!
0307887960|1.0|I have to say that, thankfully, I did not buy this book and received it as a present. I have to say that I have never heard about this diet before. The copy I got was brought to me by a relative from Russia and is a Russian translation of this \\"masterpiece\\". I started flipping through the pages and was less than impressed by recycling of the already cliche Atkins-like diet ideas and pure nonsense. I have tried too many diets before (including Atkins) and have been reading about nutrition and life long eating habit changes, to know better. The book would obviously appeal to someone without any knowledge about diets and nutrition. The proposed approach is not sustainable and, furthermore, very dangerous. I remember ending up in an emergency room when while being on Atking diet. The Dukan diet is not a sustainable long term eating life style. It does not promote a healthy and well balanced eating habits. I find it ridiculous that the list of \\"allowable\\" foods on this diet is limited to 100 items ONLY including 28 vegetables.  Why not 101 or 99? This is simply ridiculous! To my horrow, kale that is considered one of the healthiest vegetables, is NOT ON THE LIST. What about arugula - NOT ON THE LIST again!!!  Oh, and white fish did not make the list BUT there are 5 entries for beef - 1.Beef steak, 2.Fillet of beef, 3.Sirloin steak, 4.Roast beef, 5.Rump steak. What about beef brisket? Not healthy enough to make the list? There are no fruit or multigrains or nuts on this list. The Dukan \\"diet\\" does not allow any vegetable or animal oils (even olive oil) and advokates the dangelous vaseline oil. The diet also gives OK to the artificial sweateners. I would recommend that the author take a 101 class on nutrition.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Stick with the lifestyle changes that can be gradually incorporated into one's lifestyle incorporating healthy eating and excercise habits. There are no miracle diet solutions. There are no quick weight loss miracles. I am glad I did not wastemy money buying this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love this show!  You get a taste of history,humor, and see how the rich lived so far above everyone else.  There was no middle class.  The grandmother is hilarious and I love her dry, witty humor...great actress!  The men are all nicely groomed and even the servents dress nice at Downton!

B009XHAM8G|5.0|I had first read this story  years ago to my daughter it has always been our favorite. We even read it one day to a group at a nursing home. Tonight many years later I am reading this story to my granddaughter. Thank you for sharing  your wonderful gift of this book. It has meant a lot to me and my girls. Thanks again

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think that everyone should read this book. It is AWESOME. I would recommend this book to any young adults
B005COO1X6|4.0|Always an SK fan, I expect to be fully enthralled by his work.  I read this one while backpacking alone in the Rockies, miles from anyone, in a rainstorm, yet couldn't get spooked!  It lacked the bite that his longer works with complete character development have- buy in to the characters.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|People with no streaming devices can buy this without any second thought. But people who already have streaming devices most likely will buy for the Tab casting and the tab casting is not smooth. But the Price is a steal with 3months of Netflix. It's so cheap we can buy it.<br />Coming to the performance i am giving 3 starts as the Tab casting is not smooth which is the main reason what i want on this device.<br />Youtube, Netflix are excellent and i can give 5 starts for these for the ease of casting.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent book for the price. I bought copies for several friends and they each enjoyed it and grew from it as well. Definitely worth a read.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Wish the book would have gone into why the main characters were responsible for what happened, but it didn't. Kind of a lackluster end to a great series, but maybe that leaves open the possibility for another book some day.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love this cable... I use it for my Kindle, my Kindle Fire, and my cell phone. I especially like the fact that it is so long and can reach all of the plugs in my house as well as being able to plug it into the computer. I would recommend it to anyone but be sure to get the one with the plug adaptor the first time you buy it. This is the 3rd one that I have bought so I didn't need to buy another adaptor.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|Kevin Costner, James earl Jones, Field of Dreams is a great movie that you can never tire from seeing it too many times.  Great story.  I  Love it. Nothing bad to say.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has a great story and great effects and it makes you really think about your life.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  It gave me a glimpse into life somewhere else at another time; and it kept me wanting to see the next episode to see what would happen next.  I can't wait to see the new season.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Although it took a while to finish the book, it was a great read! The action parts were intriguing and detailed. This is the fourth time I've read the whole series.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Pretty predictable. I kept waiting for a twist, never happened. The only reason i finished the book was because i was sure there had to be something more that was going to happen. Disappointing read.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|The move is about a very good man turned soldier.  Loved the location of the movie and true representation of the people of Fentress County, Tennessee.  Been to his house and mill turned into a State Park.  The people of Fentress County are as proud of Sergeant York today as they were after World War I.  Highly recommend the movie.  Worth watching many times.
1490313370|4.0|It isn't the best book I ever read but on the other hand, I definitely got something out of it.  I think this book is a worthwhile read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Brought up many ethical questions as well as thoughts about what it means to love someone.  I would definitely recommend this one!
0062513346|4.0|This book goes into territory that is kind of far out in my estimation.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and even had a hard time putting it down.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Enjoying this game. Like having the choice of power ups to let you complete each puzzle. The blueprint water puzzles are fun too. Almost done with construction.
0307279189|5.0|This book really struck a chord with me and has been life changing in many ways.  I would recommend it to anyone - even non-runners (I was a non-runner before I read this book).
B009KS4XRO|4.0|this is fun to play and seems enjoyable so far - but having more winning cards would be more worth the playing time
0544002318|5.0|Well worth the time spent reading this.  I enjoyed the book a great deal and some of the author's tips have definitely been helpful to me.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Action packed from beginning, to the end. Great characterization as well. My only complaint is there isn't another book to read that continues the adventure.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|good acting, good twist, 2 in 1 movie.  overall, it was very entertaining.  I love all these actors, so this review is prob a little bias but Jude law kills it
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Havent tried it out with games yet, but it has excellent precision for a cheap price.  A great buy.  I would recommend this over others.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Saw this movie over and over with my son when I was 11 years old, and got to see it with him now that he's 11 years old.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Battery Pro shows the info I want where I want it displayed. it also allows you to review your use.......
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A great telling of her own coming of age and finding her carrer path.  Even the sarcasm is sarcastic.  If you think you might like this, you most certainly WILL like this.  I could gush on & on.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is really fun, and today is your only chance to get it for free! This is a really great game for the brain and thinking, and might prepare your kids for school. This is a really good game for people who are into mysteries and puzzles, for example if your kids are or were a fan of the nick show House of Anubis. It requires you to use your skill.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great read. Gone Girl was recommended to me by three different people before I purchased it. Why did I wait?? The writing style is amazing. I grew to know the characters and was invested in them, but never knew what would happen next. This is truly a page turner!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|If you ever wondered what goes through the mind of one of the most prolific writers on the planet then read this book.  It's a great look at his life and his process.  Perfect for any aspiring author or fan.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Like so many, I'm enthralled with the series.  While Book 3 still remains my favorite, this is a very exciting installment in the story.  There are parts that drag and the introduction of new characters can create some confusion, the action is amazing and the twists and turns are not at all expected.  Great read.
B00B1RB942|4.0|This anime features everything I love about anime and none of the awful fan service that usually turns me off.  This has a great scifi premise but is grounded around this hilarious family just trying to get by in rural Japan.  You do need to know a little about Japanese family structure to get some of the humor and plot, but it's not to bad.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. It Certainly in increasing your hand-eye coordination. And finger sweeping dexterity on my kindle fire hd.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This movie was a supposed comedy, but wasn't very funny. The wife is an overreactive, prude and the husband is a 'stuck in my 20's bro' trying to keep the magic alive in his marriage. Pretty much one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. If this is what being 40 really is, my only hope is I die of a heart attack before I get there.
B000VSBX34|4.0|no problems, thanks. would order again. good to see again. wish they could have done more. they will live through their music.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I had to watch this movie twice before I fully understood what was going on. There are 5 different plots going on a one time which makes for an interesting story. Further cements that Tom Hanks is the greatest actor that ever lived.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|This album is great. It's a rare occasion that I can pop in a cd and like each and every song. If you love sweater weather and female robbery, you're going to fall in love with the other tracks on this album.
B0016J81B4|1.0|I bought a pair of these 5 years ago and still have them. I thought they were great. So when I needed new ones in Feb, I bought them again. Unfortunately, these were not made with the same quality. The bottom was peeling off of them within 6 weeks, and they were falling apart. I would have thought I would get more than 6 weeks out of them. They have been lying in the bottom of my closet ever since. Crocs quality has definitely declined.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|this game was fun in the beginning and now not so much.  it freezes up and there are to many limits on things.if there was a game host to help you build a different style village and allows to do other things beside what everyone else has and is doing.  might have a WINNER :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you are not a fan yet of Downton Abbey, then jump on the bandwagon!! Start with Season 1 and get caught up. I envy you! I loved every minute of all 3 seasons...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is the best game you would ever play I hope this game is helpful for taking care of your in the real world and in the game this game is about helping your pets in the game you feed them and you play games with them and you wash them and blow dry them and once you have more then one pets they can play with each other and that is my review I hope you like it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I don't understand why everyone is so crazy about minecraft, but there must be a reason, I have'nt found it yet
B005OZE9SA|2.0|Bought it for travelling... Can't get it to work with PT10... Sent it back... Got a MBox Mini and had a nice trip!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|GREAT READ.. SO MANY CHARACTERS TOWARD THE MIDDLE & END.. WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN ON AUDIO.<br />NEED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I LOVE THIS book and the other books and magazines in this blog is about the other side effects of blog's
B003O86FMW|5.0|More intense than the first!  I loved it! The end is the best part! Couldn't put it down! You won't regret it
B005544V6A|5.0|I missed this episode. I love Suits and was so happy I could view it due to my Amazon Prime subscription.<br /><br />This is the first time I used this service and nice to know I can watch missed episodes of my favorite programs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing it's funny and attractive . I just download the game and its amazing. It's fun to play everyday
B006S01GH2|5.0|Honestly, I'm really not that big on foreign films because IMO, it's usually not worth the effort reading the subtitles. But this movie was well worth it! It's a fun and quirky movie, and you'll surely fall in love with Amelie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a really interesting book because it is the tell about the movie the hunger games but I think it tells more information about how the characters were like AND there emotions were.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|Great movie - funny and heartbreaking at the same time.  Well done love story during a very sad time in history.  Must like subtitled movies  - I'm not sure if there is an English version.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very fun and addictive. It is a good game, although, it could give a little more on the mystery plants and the pearls. Like, let you get a little bit more rare plants then ones that you can already buy with sand dollars. Also, maybe just a little bit less time on the rare fish. So, you don't have to wait so long for pearls. I end up doing all the quests and getting to a point where I have nothing to do , but try to level and sometimes it  takes a bit to level up. Otherwise, I like everything else. Great  graphics, fun story, cool  looking fish,  fun facts, etc. I think it's pretty cool. :)
B004KPX5GC|5.0|Watched this movie as a requirement for a leadership course I was taking.  Initially thought it was going to bore me to death.  It was not only inspiring but based on true events (duh).  Great film!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Despite a riveting perf by Daniel Day Lewis, the real history - especially the political history -  of this era is illuminated much better  by Doris Kearns Godwin than by Spielberg's film. .  Lincoln without his principles would not have become such a towering figure - but Lincoln, without his political skills, would not have become president.
B00364K6YW|5.0|After the remake of this movie came out I was afraid this one wouldn't be available.  I much prefer it.  You can't 'modernize' characters to appear more like us without losing the reality of the people of that time period.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Lots of action AND action stars. Great to see them all in one flick. Stallone is great as he matures to this recent movie
0307352145|5.0|Introverts are here and unnoticed because we aren't compelled to vocalize ourselves.  Why do some people talk sooooo much?  It's a mystery to we quieter ones.  It helps to read a book that doesn't portray us as lacking.  We also have opinions as do the extroverts but we do respect boundaries and can mostly keep ours to ourselves.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Since  we are not opera fans.  We do love Maggie Smith and Billy Connolly has always been a fav. I love his Scottish accent. Anyway this is a feel good movie that left us humming for some time afterwards.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I missed this when it was at the theater and was happy to view it at home.  A lovely film depicting this royal as a human being who like us all have our own personal struggles.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This song makes me want to just dance around.  It is so fun, and what perfect timing for summer anthem!  A little different than normal DP - def check it out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am really enjoying Minion Rush so far! If you like Temple Run style games, this one is for you!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Pure and simple, if you like giant robots and monsters beating the crap out of each other, you will love this movie!!
0312330537|5.0|such a cool book! really buy this its super interesting and long enough that it will take you more than a day
B003TH14H4|5.0|I just love this show. Vidoe on demand is fantastic, no errors at all. I will definitely be ordering the next seasons.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I got this for my husband and he really likes it. He has never like to wear a watch but now I have to ask him not to wear it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I just love this show. Vidoe on demand is fantastic, no errors at all. I will definitely be ordering the next seasons.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Goes beyond 1984 & Brave New World to depict life in a brutal totalitarian state.  Although fiction, the background for the plot and  characters rang so true to the reality of modern day North Korea that your gut feeling of horror was with you for the whole read.  Impossible to put down, and when you finished it was with a sigh of relief that we live in a free democratic state.
B008H04T84|5.0|havent read it yet, its for a school assignment. but the book looks brand new and it so much cheaper than at my bookstore.
B003K15INU|3.0|Even though I read it just a few weeks ago, it's hard to recall the details. It seemed classic Philip Roth.  He over analyzes everything and always is trying to figure out where everybody's head is at.  He needs to relax more and take life as it comes.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is the way all books should be written. Great message in a small package. Interesting and creating need for further reading on topic.
B00005JO9J|3.0|It's to it's dictation. Have not used it yet but the disc look good and im excited to watch it
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|It worked fine until we got to world  three. Once we got there it glitched. At the beginning of the board it automatically stops and keeps taking lives away so you can't play it at all past that. Very disappointed because it was a fun game.
B006PE6VW6|4.0|This was such a cute and fun romantic comedy. It was predictable, but there were a number of funny parts.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Holy carp E. L. James has done it again!!!!!!  Can't wait for the next book. Going to start it tonight!
B0067R0APK|5.0|Because it gives me everything I'm looking for and more. Hourly, weekly and likely forecasts. Maps. Averages. Great and useful graphics.
1401940676|4.0|I had read this book several months ago and was intrigued with the insights Anita Moorjani gained after her near death experience. So I recently sent for the CD so I can relisten to that part of her story as much as I want. Most of her insights are very inspiring --some of them I'm not so sure about but they are thought provoking --  all are intriguing.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I enjoy Jack Reacher novels, and I enjoyed this one also.  Some of the later books that I have read were hard to put down, but this one was not that spellbinding.  I think the character has improved with time, and I plan to continue reading from the series.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Movie was good but Amazon had real problems delivering it to us. This has happened twice now where we had to restart the movie 4-6 times. It really gets old fast.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|Really a fine sound track. Well worth the cost in my opinion!  It is great to have access to thus on multiple devices via the Amazon cloud.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever you have to get it its like temple run but way better get it now
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My family and I thought this movie was hilarious!! The minions were too cool and the little girls were adorable and very clever. All the characters meshed well together!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Good graphics for an app.<br /><br />What I really don't like is just how SLOW it is. The game forces you to be online to manually click every single little building or pen to collect the money needed to progress, the money caps on most the buildings/pens is very low so unless you stay online for 12 or more straight hours clicking the collect button literally every 5 to 15 minutes it will take you forever to gain the gold needed to do anything, then when you finally have the gold to buy a new building or pen, you have to wait upwards of 1 or more hours till the thing you bought completes building....unless you pay the outragous prices they want to buy more gold or in-game cash. It's fun building a dino park but a very slow process. They will try to milk every penny out of you though unless you are VERY patient.<br /><br />I would recomend this game if you are ok with the slow pace and long wait times. Try this game while watchin a movie or something.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not up to par with A Thousand Splendid Suns or The Kite Runner. This had more of a fiction style than the others of Mr. Hosseini's works.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is absolutely great! It allows me to talk ti my friends while in completely different places, almost like the computer version.
B000HL09SA|4.0|A heart warming tale that's easy to watch, no violence.  This movie is great for family viewing.  Love the dog.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It's beautiful, good staff, amazing voices, excellent work of everybody envolved in the filming. It gets to translate all the character and profound the Victor Hugo' s writing and sensibility.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush is a really fun game.  Fast action and doesn't get boring.  I love those Minions.  They crack me up!
B0007TKNII|5.0|I adore this story, the orchestration, the interpreters, everything is sensational. It's romantic, envolving, passionate, every woman in any time of her life would have wanted a love like the one shown in this film
B008HK3XOU|5.0|fits, works fine, all good, I recommend to others, what more do you want me to say about a kindle case?
B000FA675C|5.0|Great read, although it is initially hard to follow it is well worth it! Now I must see the movie!
B001KT6JPA|4.0|Still great movie.  Dark and entertaining.  Love dark make you think movies. The book series is also amazing.  Thomas knows dark characters.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I saw others play this game and became intteredted. Once I downloaded it I became hooked. I wish there were more hints though. Then I could rate it higher.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addictive fun. Play everyday and if u like this game get Coin Dozer season. I love Game Circus. All apps from this maker never fail.
B00BHMF578|5.0|this is a great movie affleck was snubbed. I didnt know john goodman was is this. guess what john goodman is in this movie.
140006922X|1.0|This book is a continuation of the the denial of the divinity of Jesus, That he (Jesus) is a walking contradiction is to put it mildly, silly. Authors such as this Reza are always searching for the cultural person in an attempt to discount the scripture that demand the attention and action of the reader, i.e. the I Am statements, Jesus declaration that He is the way the truth and the life, that He will be put to death and then resurrect on the third day, that he and the Father are One etc. The question that needs to be answered is this \\"Is He the way, the truth and the Life or not?\\" If He is not then let us live as we like, how we like and with no regard to any moral or truth because in the absence of any absolute we are in the throes of relativism. However if He is who He say's then we must conduct ourselves in the manner prescribed. Foundational to the Christian belief is what first needs to be addressed and that is the creation of time, space, matter. Genesis tells us that God created and in that belief we can see Gods Power, Love, Design and Sovereignty, so that all that the scriptures tells us is just the documentation of that creation through time, space and matter, nothing is impossible for Him. The authors scholarship is not in question although his motive is clear, that is Jesus is just a man not divine, hence the Muslim claim that Mohamed is a greater prophet than Jesus (in a very long list of prophets). The historical climate and political realities notwithstanding is not what the old and new testament is about, it is about the character of God and His plan to save mankind from his sin. There are any number of scoffers and gainsayers that will deny the foundational premise of our belief, namely that God created to which we respond with the pointed question of \\"If God did not create, how did something come from nothing?\\" Oh and spare me that science will eventually figure it out speech, it sounds like faith to me and what I am saying is that my faith is more reasonable and that the central figure of that faith is Jesus. Whereas the central figure of science is an apelike creature.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is the first book of its kind that I've ever read.  It teaches a new way for Information Technology groups to conduct business but is written in the form of a novel.  Cool concept; but I was skeptical about whether it would work.  And, while it won't win any Shakespearean-type awards, it certainly does the trick of giving IT groups an interesting way of learning this &#34;DevOps&#34; topic which is all the new rage.  I understand there is a follow on to this book coming out soon.  I'm looking forward to that, too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and the ability to sit and watch several episodes at one time as my schedule allows.
B000YR3WUE|3.0|Let me state right out that I'm not a huge fan of Band of Horses. I dig some of their tunes and decided to purchase the MP3 album. With the execption of 'The Funeral', the rest of the tracks rated only 2 stars in my library.<br /><br />So, this band (of horses =) just may not be my cup of tea. Shame - I really wanted to like them. As such you may want to consider purchasing just 'The Funeral' which is a good tune, though frankly the lyrics in this track (as in the others) are not very deep and did not provide any great insights or feelings of identification for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses, so I decided to try a horse app. It runs great, creative gameplay and minigames, just all around pretty good.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|After having my own, this movie is so hilarious. Sometimes touching, sometimes funny. To see the front some people try to put on, but it all comes down when under pressure.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The best I have seen in a while.I don't play much but it walked me thru playing. It is a great game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Don't get this game from the Google Play Store unless you want this awesome game ruined by the countless ads and ridiculous popups you'll get from it as well. This Amazon version is truly ad-free and I love it! Thank you Amazon!
B008JFUO36|3.0|Visually this movie is really good. I loved the special effects, and the music in this movie was awesome. My only complaint on this movie was the fact that the first hour dragged on and was boring. Once it got into around 76 minutes in, that's when it started getting interesting. Decent movie, but i wouldn't buy this on DVD. I might check it out again. I thought the performances were great but i think the story needed to be more interesting.<br /><br />This movie reminded me a bit of The Matrix movies and at the end more of Independence Day. Like i said before, it's a decent movie, but you really have to be patient and sit through the first hour in order to enjoy the movie.
B000002JSN|5.0|I saw Zeppelin in Tampa June 3rd,1977 it was this Tour. After 4 songs it started to rain a riot ensued. What I observed and how I survived I will keep to myself. Back to Physical Graffitti review- a set of Headphones or a great set of speakers and solitude will bring just rewards. The songs played in it's entirety from Custard Pie, The Rover, In my time of Dying on side one to the final \\"cough\\" of Robert Plant and Page's guitar ditty brings one out of trance Back to Reality to Flip the Record for side 2 Houses of the Holy, Trampled under foot, Kashmir by now One should be feeling pretty relaxed and ready for side 3's In the light - Bron-yr<>aur - Down by the Seaside - Ten Years Gone... Robert Plant's vocals on In the light = singing \\"everybody needs the light\\" is an amazingly heartfelt moment that if fully present is a great service to our emotional selves. The lyrics on this album are positive and healing so far which brings us to side 4 Night Flight, The WantON Song, Boogie with Stu, Black Country Woman and Sick Again. The song Night Flight is pretty sexy Robert Plant, The Wanton Song has a Repetitive Hard Rocking Page with some nice lead work, Plant's singing about failure of some sort will be felt in the last wail. Then comes Boogie with Stu which is a deep south hillbilly piece that sounds cool with Zep jamming it. Lyrically Plant is breaking someone's heart and laughing about it. Next song turnabout is fair play as Plant whines about his hurt feelings in Black Country Woman. He fantasizes having her sister next and next verse admits he is the same way too. Bonham's Bass drum stamps the temper tantrum all through out and ends with Plant asking \\" what's the matter with you momma? Which brings us to the Rock-n-roll lifestyle of \\"Sick Again\\" this song has a wailing slide guitar overtone that doesn't let up. It is a song of Ego and depravity which we all can get caught up in as we want to be noticed and flattered. EEEEWWWWW Satisfied EEEEWWWWW Satisfied EEEEWWWWW Satisfied aaahhh aaaahhh. So Physical Graffiti soars our spirits and then put's us right back in our basic human bodies hunting for what we want and desire. Led Zeppelin has always spoken to our innate divine intelligence and their music has an authenticity in it that I enjoy and can relate too. Plus they know how to play their instruments really well together. YES to this one it is well worth the money time and energy to explore...Peace
0345529057|4.0|i bought it after watching the three seasons, it surely add more flare to the viewing of the series, like a supplement. there are so many characters who at times are not absolute in terms of portraying good and evil. the explanation of a character in the book  kind of give you a peek into thoughts, fears, aspirations, motivations  of different characters. this in turns makes watching the series more enjoyable.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Very good movie. Unexpected turn. U have to watch carefully to get it. Got underrated reviews but i dont think many ppl got it
B005HESLUA|1.0|Where to begin?<br /><br />The cast has absolutely no chemistry.  None.  I've met paper bags who could deliver lines more convincingly.  The actors seem to have no sense of what their characters' goals are, or their hopes, or dreams, or the gravity of being stuck seventy years from home.  Though this could be because of the show's exceptionally bad writing.<br /><br />Oh yes.  The writing.  The original series had the Klingons and the Romulans, two technologically powerful and mysterious races bent on the Federation's destruction.  TNG had the Borg, a race of space zombies consuming everything in its path.  DS9 had the Dominion, a sort of anti-Federation powerful enough to cause all the usual Alpha-Quadrant antagonists to ally together in self defense.  In a lot of ways much of Star Trek is defined by the Federation's enemies.<br /><br />So who does Voyager have?  The Kazon.  If you don't know who they are (they're really forgettable) they look sort of like that guy on the History Channel who claims aliens built the pyramids.  They're nomads, they have no hierarchy and consist of different clans that war for control of, I'm not sure what really, but they shoot at each other as much as everyone else, and their technology is about thirty years behind Voyager's.  Not much of a threat there, but somehow Voyager keeps getting into fights with them for years.  Like, if these people have slow moving ships and yours is much faster and you're moving away from them, shouldn't you stop running into them after a while?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />So yeah, the writing is bad.  At some point the producers just gave up and started rehashing old TNG plots.  Q shows up, and they take away the best part about TNG by explaining everything about him (ala the new Star Wars trilogy and midichlorians).  They of course encounter the Borg and the producers, wanting to wrap everything up nicely after 44 minutes, make them essentially harmless.  There's never a sense of danger, any indicationat all that Voyager might be destroyed, because any time there is a serious threat and Voyager gets the snot kicked out of it you can rest assured that the episode will end with the reset button getting hit.  Be it through time travel, a spatial anomaly, a copy of Voyager, whatever, something will happen such that Voyager will make it through unscathed and marginally closer to the Alpha-Quadrant.<br /><br />This kind of laziness in writing trickles down to the characters too.  Everyone behaves wildly different from episode to episode.  Some days Janeway gleefully violates the Prime Directive for seemingly trivial reasons.  Other days she's its most stalwart defender.  Also she seems to be an expert on every facet of her ship, to the point where she knows more about Engineering, Science, Operations, and Tactical than the respective heads of those groups.  But it's not just her.  Everyone seems to be an expert on whatever system is needed to advance the plot along with whichever characters just happen to be the room.  Including, hilariously enough, the ship's cook who really should have been thrown out of an airlock the first episode.  Also, the crew of Voyager is made up of Starfleet and Maquis officers and soldiers who just days before had been ready to kill each other, but after like three episodes they're all best buddies.  Shouldn't there have been some mutual loathing, or at the very least, mistrust?<br /><br />Another example is the technobabble.  Sure Trek has always relied on it but the writers of Voyager didn't know how to make an episode without it.  So rather than seeing the characters grow or change in interesting ways, or the backdrop of the Delta-Quadrant change, we get a bunch of blathering about nucleogenic or polaric or tetrionic or omega particles and blah blah with the neurogenic packs infected and the dylithium reaction failing and on and on and on instead of a plot.<br /><br />There are occasional moments of decency though.  Robert Picardo has some interesting plots as a hologram slowly becoming more human.  Jeri Ryan, too, plays a former Borg drone rediscovering her individuality and identity.  That said, both of those characters felt like they were little more than ripoffs of Brent Spiner's Data in TNG.<br /><br />Unless you're a hardcore Trekkie, skip this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved this book! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was alwAys anxious to see what was going to happen next!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I absolutely love this game so much that I don't even mind starting a level over helps to keep my mind focused. Thanks for the tip on the robot it's where I am now also great for the kids.
B001D08SK0|5.0|Over 50 yrs. old...and still sounds very fresh; and now even better remastered. A must own for every music lover!!!
1612680011|5.0|Loved it, great book to get you started thinking right about finances. I recommend this book to everyone I know.
B00C061HZY|5.0|This is hands down their best album to date. I did not have to skip any songs on this album. A more mature sounding Daft Punk...you will not be disappointed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I started to read this novel because I saw the movie trailer and thought it looked interesting.  And at first that is all it was.  Somewhat interesting.  However as the psychological games began I started to wonder what would make adults treat children like they were treating Ender, and what could they possibly be hoping for in the end?  Well worth the read.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|This movie is NOT like his other ones. To much of his son , not as good. I loved his other movies. My husband did not like it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in many years.........loved Season 1 and 2 also and can't wait for season 4!
B00122LXTM|5.0|These old songs were a pleasant journey down memory lane.<br />On my modern sound system, the remastered songs never sounded better .😊
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting novel about really unlikeable people. Good plot but there wasn't much to like about the characters. We read it for a book group and had a long discussion about marriage and who people really are.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This CD is awsome sounds!  Not only is Boz an amazing artist, but his music conveys the emotion.  I's like the guitar strings are attached to someone who has lived the music.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Although there was only one season it was a great that I watch over and over.  While the series ended without conclusion, the movie Serenity provides an ending.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but was disappointed by the ending.  The decisions of the main charactersade them unlikeable. On the other hand I was interested to learn about orphan trains.
1439152802|5.0|Just when you think you have it figured out, you'll be flipping back to earlier parts to see what you missed!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I found the story line very interesting and the ending is out of this world. And i will watch it again.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good law firm show with lots of twists and surprises. You are never sure who is out to get who!
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Story line is very good you find out a few things that you didn't know for sure.Stunts where wild and some of the heavy armour wow.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I especially love the earlier seasons.  The writing is just so good, and the characters are really wonderful.  If you've never seen it, you should watch.  If you've seen it, watch it again.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book interesting, well written, thorough (in that the author anticipated and addressed challenging questions) and thought provoking.  Is it weird to kind of look forward to your next stage of existence?  I wish he had written about what it was like to experience negative life experiences 'in heaven.'  What if you run into a bully who ruined fourth grade?
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fantastic way to share everything.<br />I recommend it to all.<br />I have found and shared so many recipes and food ideas
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Touches so many cultures...women, families, parents, mental illness, poverty, sisterhood, and of course Afghanistan.  The author is uniquely qualified to give us insight into his homeland, and simultaneously transcends ethnicity to help us think about the lives of women, the relationship between parents and children, and so much more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I rated dis book Cuz I really like dis book it is Da best book… I like dis book cuz It action in it…
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Silo provides a unique setting for political intrigue and a very interesting - if pessimistic - approach to the human condition. Wool sets the reader up for his introduction to the larger world of the Silo Saga, and indoctrinates the reader subtly but poignantly to the Silo way of life. Very good read, but put away your rose-tinted glasses. They'll do you no good.
B005544TRQ|5.0|There I was wondering what to watch in summer wave of nothing when I came across this diamond in a sea of coal. I really like this show and can't wait to watch more!This show is fast,witty,great stories! A great show to watch!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|There are way too many ads with this game!! Every time I wanted to play I would have to go through at least 4 ads before the game would even load to be able to play. Once you got through all that game worked great but I am not going to go through all the ads to play the game, it took the fun out of it!!
B009N4QJ54|2.0|Too slow,very,very slow.At times even boring. it does have a few moments of comic good taste but not nearly enough.
1781162646|4.0|In short, a good fun read.  Mr. King is an exceptionally good writer and I enjoyed inhabiting his carney world known as Joyland.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great time waster for horse lovers. I wish there was a breeding feature. A bigger selection of horses would be cool too.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I found this last book to be sluggish and flat. Not much to keep interest except the hope that it'll get better. I'm not sure it ever did. I was expecting so much more for the final installment, and I was rather let down.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I have been coming across this book for awhile and was always drawn to it, but yet never chose it.  This last time that it came across my kindle I followed my instincts and I am so glad that I did so.  Well worth the read!  I did not want it to end!
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game wants gold for most dragons, to clear land it is too much coins, it is hard to move up levels unless you want to pay for everything.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|There were very few levels to see cheats for.  Good thing it was free or I would have wanted a refund
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show I knew that one person died and still was shocked at the very end when it happened!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Really liked it!!  This was a great book funny and very romantic.  Can't wait to read more from this author.  It is definitely one I will reread.  5+++
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Along with learning so much history it was a page turner about several different families .leading up to the<br />First world war. Many characters to keep track of, and reading on the Kindel it is not so easy to turn back and see<br />who belongs to whom.  But the stories are  full of suspense .
140006922X|5.0|Historical facts based on Jesus the man, not the biblical story. Pathetic how this author is being treated by media and zealots.
1846573785|5.0|loved the book, loved the series and wish it did not have to end... Would love to see how they are as a family
1490313370|5.0|It gives a fresh and new idea to start anything. I bought 4 copies and sent them to nieces and nephews, and they are to give them to there siblings. I like James but 'm not buying 16 copies. You should tie it to Uncle Eric Books.
1469220725|5.0|great book, great story and I cannot wait for the other series of the book to come out!!! I feel like the wait is FOREVER
B006UKFFE0|4.0|I liked the running example it had throughout the book and references to other materials. Overall very useful book to have.
1469220660|5.0|great book and great series. I cannot wait to continue on with the rest. It is taking too long to come out!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I had been waiting to see this film on DVD, seeing that I missed it when it was in theaters. Now I have my own copy... so thank you for that. It arrived earlier than expected, no damages or anything... no complaints here. Thanks again.
1881273873|5.0|This is a good book to help you understand your own love language  and those you love.  Learning to speak someone else's love language brings more harmony to a relationship.
B0024Y9EYS|2.0|This TV show plot is quite good, however, since the story meant to be a &#34;Sarah Connor Chronicles&#34;, I was really expecting much more out of the Sarah Connor! The actress who plays Sarah, just can't convince even a baby child that she is the real Sarah that we saw in the movies. She is too delicate, centered and respectful to be the mother of the leader of the resistance! I mean, the real Sarah was locked in a hospice! No way anyone could ever think of sending this Sarah to an hospice. That said, I think this TV show was great, most of the actors performed quite well, however they should have chosen another Sarah!
0553801473|5.0|Arrived super fast, totes cruc, you know? Condition BETTER than new. How is that even possible? Everything is better than I could have ever imagined.
1490313370|5.0|While the author is not the best writer around, the ideas are excellent.  Well worth the price for the book.  Thanks
B00280LYIC|5.0|My son eats up these books. Very hard to put it down. He reads it on his iPad with the Kindle app. This way if he doesn't know the definition of a word - the iPad highlights it & he immediately learns the word. He now has jumped ahead in his reading group at school. Can't wait for another Riordan book to come out & be available.
B00004XPPC|5.0|My grandpa's VHS copy of this movie bit the dust, so we ordered the DVD.  Arrived promptly, in original packaging - I think my grandpa has already watched it 5 or 6 times since it came!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great! Cannot stop playing t he advertise can be a lot but it stop after a few games same as if on a desk top.  Will play a lot
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is still in beta, Good for people who watch lot of video on youtube, netflix and other similar services. More services are adding compatibility. Don't expect it to be a complete replacement for Apple TV or similar device.<br /><br />It works for me and fits my need. Waiting for new features and updates soon, Hope it helps you as well.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|Great, Classic, wonderful, amazing movie ...great for all ages if you a kid or an adult this movie is awesome....better then the remake with Lindsey Lohan
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin created an absolutely new perspective on the greatest American president.  She examined in detail the way Lincoln provided leadership for a group of genius-level politicians, who would have hog-tied a lessor president.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Funny Movie ....great but the tv series is better amazing cast and great surprises in this film. a must buy
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This charming story of a village working together is heart-warming, humorous, and tender.  It is an excellent book. Buy it.
B000JJRIO8|4.0|this was the first time I had heard this album. it is as good as the last one`s they put out.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. It gives me so many options for sleep noise. I like how you can combine sounds and make one louder.
B000089HCR|4.0|I like wasp they truly kicked ass back then and still do to this day. can`t go wrong with them.
B009H5IVEG|5.0|Comment from James aged 6. This book is so good you could wish it was the first book you ever read.
B00000055E|5.0|This is one of my more favorite cds that came out after his death. it`s great and as the rest of them to follow as well.
076531178X|5.0|It is an easy read that keeps your attention. Hard to predict what is going to happen next. After reading a few other fantasy series. This one is atop of that list.
B0008237BO|4.0|anything 2pac has made it`s always great to listen too, he was and will always be the best rapper out there.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Once i started reading this book, i could not put it down! Very good read! One of the best i have read in a while.
B000086EOB|4.0|wasp kicks ass, they was and are a great heavy metal band. if you want some music with some hard sound all the way though, then you would like wasp.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It does exactly what I would expect a clock to do, keep time. It does it very effectively. I use it on my kindle HD, I would suggest leaving your kindle plugged into the charger to save you battery.
B00400NHRO|5.0|Read this year's ago in my twenty-five and always wanted to read it again. The book has a great flow and you just want keep reading until the end
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Great game. Fun to play. Except it won't let me get free gems!Errors in game are annoying. Some times it freezes up. Please fix this.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching the beginning of season one, then we lost our home in the central Texas wild fire.  I was not able to catch up till I got in on my Kindle.  I spent two days just catching up to season three.  I carried it around with me while, cleaning, cooking, in the car etc.  I don't think any program has held my attention like Suits.  My husband is now watching and feels as I do.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|NOT USER FRIENDLY.  NEEDS A HELP MENU OR SOME ATTACHED INSTRUCTIONS.  IT WAS CHALLENGING BUT POINTLESS!  SORRY I PURCHASED IT.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Mindblowing talent.just what metal has needed in years.no cookie monster crap vocals.beautifull eerie bazar vibe.do i think they made a deal with the dark lord ? Hell yes i do. Im a soldier on command.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it! It was fun :) I liked the fact that it is challenging and it keeps my interest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game!  Love it. First day my high score was over 50 thousand. I love the minions and the movies.
B0047BXRB2|2.0|Incredibly dated but I wanted to see it because it was the inspiration for the Star Wars series of movies. It consisted of the actors standing around talking most of the time.There were a couple of odd things -- like the princess was barefoot all the time, with no explanation given.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! As a matter of fact I read the series again after I finished book 3!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is a one of a kind series. Too bad it ended, but maybe in the future we'll have another season.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|With all of the star power in this would have thought it would be pretty good.  Bad acting and seemed to be nothing but one liners. quit watching after 20 minutes.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved the whole thing -  romance, intrigue, and hunky guys!  I loved the whole town of Pride, and would gladly move there any day.  Definitely recommend this whole series.
B005P4P966|5.0|Great show, laugh out loud comedy.  Amazon Unbox delivers without any problems.  Great way to catch up with any missed episodes.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|THIS GAME IS JUST SO AWESOME I JUST STARTED AND MY DRAGONS ARE GREAT THEN THE DRAGONS KEEP ON GETTING BETTER AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU WANT THE DRAGON EVEN MORE YOU SHOULD JUST PLAY IT IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND THAT IS WHY I AM GIVING IT 5 STARS BEST GAME EVER!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I first picked this book up about a year ago and frankly couldn't get into it.  There was a lot of kinky sex which was ok but not enough to peak my interest.  Then I picked it up again about 2 months ago.  There is so much amazing psychology behind the writing and I found it spellbinding.  I am on my second read of the series and have found it more interesting the second time around.  I recommend it.
B00CZF87TY|4.0|Wish they had the Barbara Ann promo song in here that played in the commercial for the song.  Loved the movie and love the sound track.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Like Kill Bill vol 1, this is a movie going into it that it will be ultra violent.  Where the first was over-the-top almost campy with the action and violence, this is not that way.  There are definitely a couple really good fight scenes, but the things are more real in this one than the first.  There is no spraying blood dismembering, or crazy stunts done with wires (save for a couple).  While it does take some suspension of disbelief to accept everything that happens, this is far more of an action/drama than the first one was.<br /><br />This volume lays out the entire back story of what lead up to the attack we see bits and pieces of in the first movie.  It also puts The Bride in real peril, both physical and emotional as the movie goes along.  The confrontation with Bill is almost all dialogue, and about 45 seconds of an actual fight scene, but it works perfectly.  To the extent that Bill could be made sympathetic in any way for what he did, the writing and David Carradine's performance pulled that off.  He balanced an almost easy going nature with a sinister one perfectly.  Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen get a lot of screen time in this one, much more than Vivica Fox and Lucy Lui got in the first movie.  The fight scene between Elle and The Bride was certainly the high point of the movie action wise.<br /><br />Ultimately whether you like this or not, is really going to depend on your taste.  The movie definitely earns its R rating.  If you like Tarantino's other movies, chances are you are going to like this one.  If bad language and violence are not up your alley, then you probably want to stay away.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Not since Wallbanger and the Neighbor from hell series have I laughed this hard. His POV into their relationship and His fall is so damn funny. Its starts out as Drew laying on the couch with the 'Flu\\" trying to explain why he's such a mess. You just have to read this book, it's funny, sexy as hell and an amazing fall from grace love story of a playboy. One of the most loveable heroes I've read in a while.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|Its fantasy and has a hero and a damsel in distress. Great movie, recommend it as a great family experience.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new version for Kindle Fire is awful. Really terrible. Bring back the old version and I'll come back from Weather Bug.
B00C8RDSWK|5.0|Loved it, great kids movie, it shows love conquers all or most all.  Recommend it as family entertainment, no need for a rating, just a fun experience.
B00DU74U74|2.0|Pretty good idea with potential but the acting was boring and the story was shallow. This was two hours that felt like four.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|this was a gift.  I haven't seen it and can't rate.  However, the recipient loved it as far as I can tell.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is much better than Temple Run with new features. It is more challenging, but that adds to the fun.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is an experience that I would never undertake myself, but it's interesting to do it vicariously through Cheryl's book.  Her writing is clear and engaging.  I've recommended it to my daughters to read.
B00AG473GE|5.0|My daughter is a huge John Hughes fan and loves all of his movies that I grew up on. So when I saw that this was available I just had to order it. I was hoping it came in time for her birthday even though I was ordering late (why I didn't think of this sooner I'll never know) but to my surprise....This is the quickest standard delivery that I have ever seen. The product was packaged very well & sturdy. Everything I asked for was included and not shipped separately even though I ordered on different dates.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Pretty much the exact game I've sunk hours into on my 360 but now its portable! If you like MTG then its probably more than worth the $10 tag.
B00AEFXXMI|4.0|I love that this movie was available on her. This came out when I was in high school and I watched it, I can't count how many times! I wanted my children to see it (especially since they are teenagers) so that they could appreciate a good movie. I had been looking for it everywhere and found it here. The packaging was great and the shipping fast.
B005IQZB14|4.0|What an inspiring journey and one filled with self-reflection. Great book to read in the mountains and an easy read. It only took a day to follow the travels of Cheryl.
B004QL7K70|5.0|I have never experienced such a great system as Amazon. This shipment was quick, painless and I couldn't believe how well executed it was. This makes me want to do all of my shopping this way. Because of this I have done more shopping then I have ever expected to do on the internet & with Amazon.
B00AYMKUOK|5.0|Just want the next one to come out. NOW. These books are an amazing story and an instant classic series.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is really into Greek Gods. She read this in one weekend it was so good. The shipment was fast and she is ready to order more.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This is a great purchase, at a good price and one of the best ways to get this series in it's original, uncut form. Many people who don't like this series are watching the heavily edited versions on other channels. Believe me, if that's all you've seen, you need to know that this series is pretty racy.<br />I'm not going to over-analyze it, the series is just good, unclean fun and this is a great way to get it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great. I love the hourly weather to see how it's going to be ever hour of the day. The weather alerts are so helpful too. Everything about this app is wonderful. I love it!
B00009V7PJ|3.0|She's lying. She'll keep touring for ever. What's the joke about after a nuclear war, only cockroaches and Cher will remain. Actually, this isn't a bad concert though. The old bird (I use that affectionately), still has enough charisma and pipes to carry it off. I wouldn't say the quality of the recording is fantastic though. Cher Fans can add a star to my review.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game but you use a lot of diamonds and you can't get any back without purchasing. Also, you are searching for the same items repeatedly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you crazy!! But you cant put it down until you complete a level! Thought provoking. You ger caught up in deep concentration...each level gets more challenging.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It turns out that thiswasn't exactly what I was looking for but it does work very well for its intended purpose.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|My preschooler loves this game! Well she's biased...she already loves ninnies!<br />(1st to review - Awesome...my insomnia finally paid off)
B002TXZT7A|5.0|Alexander Mccall Smith always delivers pleasure and insights in his 'No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency' ensemble. His familiarity with African culture allows the reader to become transported both to a new landscape as well as new mindsets. His characters are rich and full of life, believable, and his central 'mama' characters' charm leaps from the pages. Don't worry if you aren't interested in Africa per se, for the shared wisdom is universal.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I Skipped Out On SixFlags To Play This Game  . Its A Great Racing Game  &amp;  The Need For Upgrades Will Drive You To Play This Game ALL DAY  . I Haven't Ate In 2Weeks  &amp;  Think My Dog Died ,  But I Gotta Get Back To This Game. I Need A New Car !
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I ordered this great movie originally written by F.Scott Fitzgerald because it is so insightful into life in spite of how long ago it was written. The price was great, it came in one week, and it is in wonderful shape in spite of the face that it was used. I am very well pleased. Vicki
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is way better than temple run it is addicting and so much fun! I really reccomennd this game for everyone!!!
B0007OCG56|1.0|After finishing watching this film, my immediate reaction was: \\"Well, that's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.\\"<br />This film fooled me into thinking it was a comedy, when in fact the only laughs came from the completely inappropriate script, the atrocious acting and the ridiculous expressions on Flor's face.<br />Also, the characters had no substance whatsoever and I was always in perpetual bewilderment at the scene changes. For the most part I had no idea where the characters were and what they were doing.<br />Adding to this, I have no idea why Flor's daughter viewed Flor as the most influential person in her life. All I could glean from Flor's character was that she was an overly possessive mother who refused to let her daughter grow up any different than to how Flor herself was; consequently I don't believe the film sends across a very good message to mothers OR their daughters.<br /><br />I don't usually review things, however I felt it was important to ward off any unsuspecting victims who may be tempted to watch this abomination of a film.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Another excellent season! Can't get enough of this show! The laughs and twists and turns is an excellent mix! This season was even better than the first! Looking forward to season 3!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I was quite surprised that I liked this movie as much as I did. It was very enjoyable<br />and worthy of a second watch at a later date. Highly recommend this movie to all fans.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved this book!<br />It is scary, interesting, awesome, and always full of surprises.<br />If you like Greek mythology you should try this book.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I picked this show because a lot of people I know were talking about it. After awhile of seeing the screen caps and gifs about it I finally decided to dive into the series. The first episode wasn't that interesting but when you get out into the following episodes it gets better. They move so quickly and to me, intensely that the forty-four (roughly) minutes simply go quickly.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was awesome!<br />It's really exciting,silly,scary, and cool all in one.<br />I would recommend this book to people if they like magic,fantasy,or the series Harry potter.
B0091X2K0A|3.0|The acting was fair. The portrayal of the Marines is combat was a joke. They seemed to have no discipline, no comprehension of the chain of command. A colonel saluting an NCO first. Apparently there were no military advisors on the set.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is one of those games with a few choices. It is kinda fun and I like palying. I can't get Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle for free, so this is one of my game fixes. Just a little bit of fun.
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|This is an awesome album from Selena and hope everyone else like it so she can continue to do more albums
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is a fun game, I would recommend it. I played this a long time ago and it brings back good memories.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great series to read. Many of my family and friends have read this book and I continue to recommend it.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is my absolute favorite version of Phantom. It's a recording of a live performance with a spectacular cast. At the end of the production, there is a Phantom &#34;reunion,&#34; featuring Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sarah Brightman, as well as several of the individuals who have previously played in the role of the Phantom. Must see experience.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I just finished it and can not wait for the second book ! I hate to read anything else in the meantime ! I don't want to lose my place !<br />Come on really ! Do I have to wait till Aug. 27th ! :(
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Long on action short on plot. Worth see though. The story has potential but they just can't seem to draw the viewer in.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|It is a great piece of Eagles history.  There were some things I did not know about them.  I watched it before I went to the concert.  Truly enhanced the experience.  Rock on boys!!!!  Love you forever.  I have watched it several times since.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game they made so far come at me if u have the right to lol no for real come
B0042FZOFU|5.0|The set is complete, high quality Blu Ray at it´s best, the packaging is not the greatest but the interior in super nice

140006922X|5.0|Unlike many of the books written about the historical Jesus, this is a vibrant and easily accessible read.  If you're looking for Christian dogma or for a book about Jesus the Christ, this isn't the book for you - it's not (nor is it meant to be) theology, it's an attempt to look at what we can surmise about the actual historical life of Jesus the man given what's known about the time and place he lived.  Aslan's descriptions of the political and social cultures of the time are among the richest I've seen - first century Palestine has become a world I can see vividly, which has also made Jesus and his disciples more vivid.<br /><br />Ignore the one star reviews written by people who struggle with any image of Jesus that isn't on a stained glass window.  Regardless of whether you agree with all of Aslan's conclusions, this is a fantastic book.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|Where are all the other characters? Why do they kill off one of the only likeable characters in the first 15 minutes?  They should have stopped after 1.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was excited to read this next offering by Hosseini and I wasn't disappointed. His writing is beautiful and I loved how each chapter was written from the point of view of a different person- and he kept the identity of that person a mystery for a while. In the end, all connections were made among the different characters in very satisfying ways. In fact, as soon as I finished the book, I immediately started re-reading it because I felt that now that I knew these characters and how they related to each other, I needed to read the novel from that new perspective.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Enjoyed the plot twist.  I think it was missing something and did not feel completely happy with the ending of the movie.  I think HAL made a cameo near the end.
1452101248|3.0|Photography is amazing, and Chef Ottolenghi has some inspiring vegetarian recipes. However, as a foodie living in the US, I have noticed that many of the ingredients are not readily available here (quail eggs, and jerusalem artichokes, for instance) or it calls for things I have never even heard of. Despite it's artistic appeal, it is impractical for anyone who desires a relatively quick or affordable vegetarian meal. I feel that Ottolenghi is lacking the passion needed for a successful vegetarian cookbook, which prevents this book and his recipes from being a 5/5.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|First of all, those who rated this book poorly seem mostly concerned with the writing style.  This book was clearly written by Chris Kyle and he wrote it like he talks.  That can be frustrating at times from a literary standpoint, but there is no doubt that you feel like you know him after reading this book.  Reading it feels like you are sitting at a bar having a beer with him while he tells you his story.<br />Second, you really get a sense of what a SEAL is like and what they think about and do.  So I really liked this book for its story, but if you're looking for a book written by a professional author then don't read this.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I heard so much about Downton Abbey but it wasn't until season 3 that I started watching.  Of course this meant that I had to go back and watch seasons 1 and 2 so I DVR'd season 3.  I just love the series.  The acting is wonderful.  Maggie Smith is so good and so entertaining!

B008532S54|1.0|The wife and I were looking for a movie to enjoy at home with no bother.  Found this one mentioned in a blog as a very funny comedy.  Bought it.  Not very funny.  We turned it off about halfway through.
B00DU74U74|2.0|The plot of the movie was very slow and boring. There was not a whole lot of action or grab your attention plot.  I was happy at the end of the movie because it was over!  The main character was starting to get on my nerves because there where alot of self dialogs with her character, by the end it was very annoying.  I feel that the trailer for this movie did not portray what the movie was actually about, because if it did i would have never rented it!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|must have in your library.  Anyone who considers themselves creative must add this book to their collection.  You will not regret it.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very amusing Antics, Very original.  The Minions are simply adorable and have their own language, which though I don't understand most of what they say, they are hilarious at saying it.<br />The main character grows from a ruthless, focused on evil villain to a reformed caring parent.<br />A new classic that I hope everyone will get to enjoy.<br /><br />Went to Despicable me 2 in the theater and it continues to impress. It might even be better than Despicable me!

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|This is a classic mix of styles bluesy/ jazz feel with a mix of heartfelt & lighthearted songs.  Another beautiflly recorded high quality recording even on cd. (This is so good I would have loved this to have been released as recorded as an uncompressed blue ray surround sound mix...alas... maybe sometime in the future if/when uncompressed bluray quality becomes the norm).  He has a great voice and a really tight band.  This is one of my favourite albums and some friends who enjoy their music were highly impressed.

0061353248|4.0|Predictably Irrational is a quick and enjoyable read. Ariely covers many of the quirks of how we make comparisons of quality, assign value to experiences and things, engage in dishonest behavior, and so on. Readers with some familiarity with behavioral economics and the psychology of decision making won't find anything Earth-shattering in this book, but it is an extremely accessible introduction for the uninitiated. As other reviews note, Ariely tends to draw broad conclusions and policy implications in each chapter based only on one or a small number of experiments (involving, of course, college undergraduates as the subjects). With that caveat in mind, Predictably Irrational is a fun and often interesting look at human irrationality. I also recommend Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow for readers interested in the general topic.

B00CFA222M|5.0|I was pretty \\"meh\\" about the idea of watching this movie, but absolutely loved it!  Jack the Giant Slayer is a beautiful twist on an old fairy tale with a delicious surprise ending!  I would say that it is like Princess Bride meets the Neverending Story.  It would be a good idea to preview it for younger children, but my 6 and 7 year olds will be watching it (they have also seen all of the Harry Potter, Star Wars, Trilogy of the Ring movies, etc with no ill effects-something about the clearly fantasy aspect of these type movies make them fun to watch but clearly unbelievable I guess).  I highly recommend this one!

I will defend the guys, against many haters because Operation;mindcrime Part 2 was an excellent album but that must have been a fluke considering the band dropping their balls again on their next effort.    Anyhow, with the cancer that was Tate gone and even better which is the addtion of La'Torre at the pinacle of his talents, FINALLY, and I'll say it again, FINALLY, we fans can look forward to amazing albums from one of metal's greatest groups, for years to come. This album will wash away the bad taste of s*** records Ryche had been feeding us fans for nearly 2 decades. A must buy!

0786915749|2.0|This book to me was what I expected. Elves, Dwarves the typical half breed human, dragons etc. I found this book (I hate to use this word) cliche. I didn't really find the story all that interesting. To me the characters felt.. boring for lack of a better word. The story progression was decent. I did feel though that, they movie around the continent fairly quickly without much happening. First they are at a tavern, then a lake, then a strange forest and they fly to a burned down village near some mountains. I feel it skipped around to much without anything important going on. I especially liked how boring the part of the book where they're in the \\"dying\\" Elven kingdom. What a drag it was. Perhaps this isn't my genre of read, but I felt like this book was written for a 6 year old. These, of course, are just my opinion.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|The author of this book conceals his being a Muslim on interviews, and when challenged about this, would conveniently point out that he disclosed this on the second page of his book. Well, the second page of his book does NOT speak out during interviews. Perhaps if he constantly discloses he is a Muslim at the beginning of every interview, I might give him more credit.<br /><br />This author calls Jesus a \\"political troublemaker\\". I wonder how Muslims would react if a Christian wrote a book about Mohammed and describes him as a \\"political troublemaker\\". This author's credibility is tainted by his dishonesty and deceptiveness. Trashy book.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's game was an interesting read. Quick read (3 days) and flows very well with very little to no boring parts. Book is targeted for teenage group. 10-16 I'd say, still found interesting at 20. A must read if you find your self a Sci-Fi fan.
193700788X|1.0|Did Harris even write this novel or was it was some evil twin! It wasn't her writing style, characters or using the plot she has carefully established over the whole series.<br /><br />First of all the writing style. The previous novels have been interesting, sexy, humorous and lived up there name of 'Vampire Mysteries', also her style makes her books flow nice and seamlessly from one idea to another. This novel was boring and clunky, with no humour, vampires or mysteries in sight! I don't know what happened it was the  last book in the series, it is supposed to be the BEST!<br /><br />The characters, what can I say! Sookie and Eric seemed to do personality swaps. Sookie became a heartless, cunning bitch and Eric all of a sudden lost any power and cunning he had and became a victim of circumstances. Maybe its me but both characters became a lot less interesting.<br /><br />Speaking of Eric and Sookie, when you have spent nearly 10 books setting up and exploring a relationship why do you destroy it in the space of a few chapters with no reaction from your heroine? it doesn't help people  think your heroine is a great person when they quickly forget a person they have spent so much time with and are now loosing forever. it doesn't make sense! The fey (or fairy) storyline has also been carefully established only to be completely ruined, and the Arlene storyline forget it!<br /><br />The series is good but as and ending this book is disappointing. It doesn't seem to be true to the rest of the series in either character or plot. In short it seems to suffer from an author identity crisis.
1938469003|4.0|Finally bought the book and glad I did. Great content, interesting history, seems well researched. As an avid and budding homebrewing of two years and 40ish batches I was hoping to extract a little more detail from the brewing side...but there is enough information to get me interested in tweaking a few things with future IPAs. Good job Mr. Steele. I look forward to seeing more in the future.
B00AO3K01C|5.0|[NO SPOILERS] A work of literary fiction that fuses Zen Buddhism, Quantum Mechanics, Japanese Pop Culture, a Coming of Age Story, a time-bending mystery and Global Interconnectedness - what's not to love about Ruth Ozeki's `A Tale for The Time Being'?<br /><br />If I could, I would give this book more than five stars without hesitation.<br /><br />The secret hidden in the title of the book gives the first clue to its quietly mysterious nature. The phrase `time being' is not used in the commonly understood sense here. Drawing from the 13th Century Zen Master Dogen Zenji's sutra, the word `time being' has a different meaning. As it is explained on the very first page: \\"A `Time Being' is someone who lives in time, and that means you and me and everyone of us who is, was or ever will be. \\"<br /><br />The essence of the story is examining the nature of time, and kicks off with the diary of a Japanese schoolgirl Nao (`Now' - get it?). The diary, wrapped in a freezer bag, is washed ashore in British Columbia where it's discovered by Ruth, an author, based on Ozeki herself. In the diary, Nao talks about her intention to end her life soon. Trying to discover if the schoolgirl killed herself or died in the 2011 tsunami, Ruth and her husband begin an increasingly desperate search. Within the diary are also contained unforgettable characters like her great-grandmother, a 104-year-old feminist Zen nun Jiko and Haruki#1, a WWII Kamikaze pilot.<br /><br />An ordained Zen Master herself, Ozeki reveals the hidden common essence on seemingly disparate issues -- the death of individuals and the death of the planet, parallel universes and Buddhist metaphysics, the author Ruth's life and the life of teenager Nao. What I love most is that she does it so skillfully, so simply. At one point in the book, talking about his landscaping work, Ruth's husband Oliver says: \\"The work succeeds when all the cleverness and artifice have disappeared, after years of harvest and regrowth, when people begin to experience it as ambience only.\\" Such is the success of this book too.<br /><br />Unlike other books that take on such lofty ambitions, this one thankfully does have a plot and twists that keep you reading right till the end. It has also beautifully captured moments of family life and some shocking instances of schoolyard bullying. It sometimes feels like it is meandering but hidden in the asides and casual interactions, you realize when you finish the book, were great revelations.<br /><br />I also liked that the soul of the book is inspiring and positive, not depressingly nihilistic like I find in many so-called great works of modern fiction. At one point, our main character, Ruth, quotes Zen Master Dogen as saying that each day is composed of 6,400,099,980 moments. The point is that every single one of those moments provides an opportunity to reestablish our will. Even the snap of a finger, he says, provides us with 65 opportunities to wake up and choose actions that will produce beneficial karma and turn our lives around.<br /><br />In the end, that stays with you as the message of the book. The possibility of making new choices in any one of the 6,400,099,980 moments we have every day. The possibility of choosing afresh within a snap of the fingers.gin to experience it as ambience only.\\" Such is the success of this book too.<br /><br />Unlike other books that take on such lofty ambitions, this one thankfully does have a plot and twists that keep you reading right till the end.

B009GIPDQS|2.0|With almost 5000 ratings on Amazon with an average of 4 stars, I came to this book with high hopes of a light, fast-paced novella with lots of twists and turns.<br /><br />Alas, I was disappointed by this much-hyped book. For one, there was little in it that didn't feel like an episode of a weeknight crime drama.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a federal judge who is murdered, and our hero in prison knows who did it, and why. But the book takes an awfully long time to get off the ground with agonisingly unemotional details and statistics about prison life. Secondly, I feel it is a bit cheap for a serious thriller writer like Grisham to create characters who lie and mislead the reader in order to have a plot.<br /><br />I struggled through it with grim determination and finally reached the end more to be done with it than with any excitement.<br /><br />I guess the larger problem is that readers like me are today getting their legal/thriller fix from dozens of very-well written television dramas as well as movies. Coming up with an original plot for a book is difficult, and keeping the reader guessing is even more difficult. (Though I must say that \\"Gone Girl\\" still ticked all the right boxes for me).<br /><br />PS: I did not find the book \\"ELECTRIFYING!\\" or \\"A REAL PAGE TURNER\\" as the blurbs say. More like bland and more or less predictable.

B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Like most people, I became a Khaled Hosseini fan after reading The Kite Runner. So I was excited to read his new book after many years.<br /><br />It treads familiar Hosseini ground - the nostalgia for the rugged but honorable old Afghanistan, separation of families and friends across continents, guilt, hardship and tragedy. This book is more epic in scope than The Kite Runner, and leaves you with a big lump in your throat at the end...<br /><br />The sprawling book begins with a haunting fable about a div (giant monster or ogre in Persian) who takes away a little child from his family. A div, or demon, draws a father into a terrible pact. The father can gift his favourite son a better life by giving the child away, never to see him again.<br /><br />We soon find out that it is actually a microcosm of the rest of the book. This is what Saboor, the poor Afghan father telling the story, is himself about to do to his three-year-old daughter, Pari, who has an unusually powerful bond to her brother, Abdullah. Pari is adopted by Nila Wahadati, a rich, rebellious childless poetess. Pari's step-uncle Nabi works for Nila's husband Suleiman Wahadati. Though the child is distraught by the thought of being away from her brother Abdullah, she slowly forgets her past after she is introduced to a life of affluence and independence. A life that would have been unimaginable had she grown up in her native village of Shadbagh. Still, Pari feels a sense of being incomplete and she cannot figure out why.<br /><br />The rest of the book is comprised of nine short stories, each telling the life of one of the interconnected characters in the book. Some of them a little gems with unexpected stings in the tail. A couple are slow and drag along while we wait to find out if Pari & Abdullah will eventually meet. Through the process, we encounter the conflicted inner worlds of character in classic Hosseini style, and revisit our own half-finished lives in the process.<br /><br />Overall, not as punchy as The Kite Runner but still a beautiful book. A touch more contrived emotionally. But still a good epic with an interesting narrative device, told by a writer who has great insight and greater compassion for the human heart. We see ourselves in the pages and in the longings of the characters.punchy as The Kite Runner but still a beautiful book. A touch more contrived emotionally.

B009WUBERW|1.0|Films I have ever seen.  Had I spent the money to watch it in the theater, I would have walked out.  It was actually painful to see my once childhood heroes pumped with botox and put on a pitiful display of acting.  Big names, big egos, bad acting.<br /><br />I would highly suggest that you spend your time more wisely.
B002RSOTSM|5.0|Great movie with great cast, and of course a master director - the master of suspense, AH.  The story line is interesting, too.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I didn't have any expectations going into this, and found myself really surprised in how good it was. I hadn't heard anything about it but I am definitely a fan of the series now. Can't wait for Season 2.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I thought the premise of the book was good.  However, as the story unfolded, one could already see the ending.
B004SDEP38|5.0|If you're like me, you've used different smartphone platforms. Docs to go has been available on the four or so I've used. Sometimes available for free. There's a lot to be said about portability. Documents going from one version to another should do so with ease. And they do. As a result, this is an app I like seeing available for whatever device I have.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|There might be a better weather app-but I haven't found it yet! I only wish it would incorporate phases of the moon and planets.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|I throughly enjoyed the movie.  It was clever, witty and very touching.  Excellent family fare with a great story.  Not too scary.  Just the right amount of thrills for young kids.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I grew up with Star Trek TOS.  Love that I can watch it via Amazon!  It still is the best of the series!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I am glad it was the free app or I never would have tried it. I am enjoying it so far. There seems to be a fair variety of puzzles.
B00A27X972|5.0|Great summer book! I enjoyed the plot, pacing, character development, interactions between characters, and the British perspective (it's nice to have a &#34;beach read&#34; that isn't American). The other Amazon reviews capture the plot in much more depth, but basically a professor proves the Reimann Hypothesis and an alien is sent to Earth to ensure that the proof is never made public. The author does a good job at showing human life through alien eyes (especially our interactions with dogs); it's funny and touching throughout. Also now I want to go learn more about prime numbers.
0330517341|5.0|Beautiful illustrations, clever rhymes, wonderful, moving tale. We have already read it many times and enjoy it more with each read.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This was a great addition to the Bosch series, as Harry sets out to solve his Mother's murder, a cold case long forgotten. It starts out with Harry on suspension for something he did. We don't know what that was at first, but it gradually gets explained as he talks with the dept. psychiatrist. The story also takes place after a huge earthquake, that destroyed Harry's home. So down on his luck,out of work, and very angry, he sets out to do something he realizes he should have done years ago; solve his Mother's murder.<br />Twists and turns galore, with the usual who can he trust, it becomes a real page turner. We learn more of Harry's past and what makes him tick today. Everything doesn't go smoothly and Harry ends up with a bundle of guilt, that leads us into a shaky next installment.  I read some of this book, and listened to some of it on audio. The audio is wonderful, as the narrator does a great job with all the emotions of the story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hussein hasndione it again. Another riveting story. Couldn't putnthenbook down. I'd highly recommend this book to everyone, especially if you loved The Kite Runner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|....I just enjoyed the series very much.  wish there were more shows like this on television.  thank you to the producers!
B00CATSONE|4.0|The Author has successfully given my mind a better understanding of how to meet the challenges of \\"success\\".  A very interesting read
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft just may be on of my favorite games! You can craft and create just about anything you want. It does need to be updated though. I have this game on computer and Xbox and all of them are updated other than that Minecraft is a must have. Its truly an amazing game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book objectively looks at the life of Jesus. It thoroughly describes life of Jesus as he lived and how later Christians interpreted, changed it for their own reasons. Authors shows Jesus as a Jewish revolutionary man who wanted to reform Judaism and help poor; and is metamorphosed into  God by Paul and others. Paul introduces Christianity to Gentiles and changes its core teachings that were basically similar to Judaism. There is tussle between James--brother of Jesus--and Paul about what is Jesus' message, in which Paul ultimately wins. Most of modern Christianity is influenced by what Paul thought of Jesus and his message.<br />It is a great book, and I hope similar objective book is written about Muhammad and others.<br />In this book, Jesus the God and Jesus the Man come out as different beings, however both equally remarkable.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|An amazing, graceful movie. The pace, the ritual, the sense of a different culture but the same human feelings that all of us share make this movie an outstanding experience that will follow you for long time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive and this has to be over twenty characters so yeah blab bleh boa
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Christianity is a peace-loving religion with a lot of very profound spirituality which unfortunately had been hijacked by a lot of loudmouthed narrow minded people who don't really understand Christ's message as described in the gospels, and who find preachers that support the bigotry their itching ears are dying to hear.<br /><br />The book itself is not about the type of militant \\"zealot\\" which Flavius Josephus described; it argues that Jesus was actually something else.<br /><br />I tend to agree that if you don't trust the gospel writers, figuring out what Jesus did and how Christianity started is just guesswork, but, then again, the book offers a lot of historical context of the land and culture Jesus lived in.  Five stars to offset all the fundamentalists giving this book a 1-star rating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever it works great on the kindle fire. You should get this game. Don't hesitate.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|I bought this for my husband to sharpen our dull kitchen knives and his pocket knives.  He is a novice on this type sharpener, so he watched some You Tube videos first. He also bought the plastic pedestal, which is a necessity.  His first attempt with the sharpener was to sharpen 2 kitchen knives, a chef and a Santoku knife.  They were both pretty dull.  He used all three stones, coarse, medium and fine at 20 degrees, one of the 4 angle choices available.  They came out sharp, not very sharp. Probably because he wasn't experienced with the sharpener. He said it does take some getting used to and it does take some time to sharpen each blade.  I think if you want sharp knives, and don't want to spend a lot for a sharpener, and have the time, this is a good deal.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I feel like crying. I don't know how to do anything. All it just does is play music. I feel like i'm staring at a picture while music play in the backround
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|After that trainwreck of an album last year and finally ridding themselves of the cause of their decline, Queensryche has come back with new energy. Sure, it is not the vintage sound from the 80's but this is not the band from that era either. This new version of Queensryche with Todd De La Torre has made an impressive first album. It is very welcomed at a time when rock appears to be a dying breed. Hopefully this effort will encourage Chris Degarmo to re-join the band.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|we laughed our buts off. this movie was a great shoot-em-up and full of action. Arnold's cameos were funny chuck just kept coming out of nowhere.
B00CW665VI|5.0|It was fun and light hearted. I liked that it was written from a males point of view, a pleasant change. Great job!!!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Some great interviews and concert footage. Extra bonus - Live at the Capital Centre concert DVD.<br />I would suggest this DVD for any big Eagles fan.
B004GYY714|5.0|The best feature for me is the browse for local stations.  So when I go to different areas I can just scan for stations. As long as they are on the Internet and there is Internet coverage.  Because it's not a radio tuner, it's still an Internet radio player.  Good value even if you pay for it.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|Fantastic 2 disc set along with the mp3 downloads make this package a bargain.<br />A shame this was the last material from the Gabriel era Genesis line up.<br />The story is not as disjointed as Phil, Tony and Mike complained about.<br />Tony Banks has some amazing forward thinking keyboard work on this album.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Visually, it was stunning but almost no story or character development to speak of. Sadly, this is exactly what is wrong with most films today. It is all about how visually captivating they can be and not on the story.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Read it as a child and re-reading now! I wish that I could get her whole collection in hard back form.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|This was by no means the story of Lincoln. Rather, it was about his involvement and passion for the 13th amendment. If you have not read &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; you will be lost.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I hated this trash.  Couldn't even finish it.  There's really nothing good to say about it and I can't believe the hype that surrounded this garbage.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Funny, understated and holds attention throughout. If you are willing to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy the ride, you will like this too!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Just couldn't get into reading this trash.  I believe that it's just pornography and is promoting bad sexual practice.  I hated it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|just wish the amazon app store would let me buy stuff,always cuts out or won't log in can be very frustrating
B00A2AU314|5.0|Great story, great acting all around. Casting was perfect for this story, and a couple of scenes with Clint will bring a tear to your eye, believe it or not. Highly recommended movie!!
B00AQL8VU4|2.0|maybe my tablet but the app store will not connect half of the time,and in middle of game cuts out and tells me &#34;sorry you must log in&#34; then stops playing and wont log in to amazon app store!
B008XCJ03K|4.0|There is some wisdom and feelin in this music which is very hard to find now a days. Love this album.
B00CJGP116|5.0|It was worth the wait for this new cd of Marc Anthony 3.0 to come out.  I love his voice and his music.  Very talented man.  Whoever has not heard or purchase a Marc Anthony CD, I highly recommend you do so.  I guarantee you will be a Marc Anthony fan!!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is a well-written comedy that delights the viewer.  The quirky characters  evoke sympathy from the audience, and even a little empathy - you really find yourself caring about them.  Remarkably, they have actually been allowed to mature through the series, thus it has not grown stale.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was good mystery with a different twist that kept your interest and made for a fast read.  I am reading some of his other books.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Not unlike &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;, this movie has a surprise ending that, if you view it again, you realize you should have known what was going on all along.  Great performance by Denzel Washington, the film has action, great drama, and not just a little humor.
B007THA4FI|5.0|lover her work. quick service to the delivery service of amazon. thank you so very much. keep making it easy
0062255657|5.0|Facinating characters & story out of Mr. Gaiman's magical mind.  I would only let myself read a chapter at a time to make it last longer :)<br />More please!
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|One awesome album. Thanks you for a fast and trouble free shipment.  You Rock. and Rock -on !  You Rock
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The best of the 5 books so far, once the action starts you won't be able to put the book down!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My entire family loves taking turns playing this game. I love it so much! I only wish the connect to Facebook feature worked.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I use it regularly on my Kindle Fire, but always keep the password secure. It lets you browse through its independent browser if you pay for the service.  If you don't it still is a very useful 'vault' for all of your passwords. I sync mine with my iPhone, Kindle, Laptops (2).
0142410373|5.0|This was one of my favorite books growing up, and I bought this to read with the kid I babysit. It is a classic!
B008TT7CXW|4.0|pro =ccard size & slim<br />easy to carry in pockets or w/ccards<br />quality ok, tough black plastic<br />anti =nothing bad
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Hi,<br />The summary definitely whetted my appetite for more. Wish I cud get the full kindle version but its not available for my market. Looking forward to buying the book to read it completely.
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|I picked this rating because of several key songs that make this soundtrack for me.<br /><br />Pacific Rim, Gipsy Danger, Jaeger Tech, To Fight Monsters, We are the Resistance, Striker Eureka, Category 5, Go Big or Go Extinct are my favorites.<br /><br />As a fan of the movie, I felt this was definitely worth the money.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I read this book for one of the Book Clubs that I belong to.  Out of the 12 women who attended, no one loved this book, or really liked it a lot.  The main problem was that while we admired the courage of the author for attempting and completing this very difficult walk on the Pacific Coast Trail (I sure couldn't do it) we did not care for her life choices.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This is such a great film - I cannot wait for the sequel, and can only hope it is anywhere near as great as this movie! It has a great message and a great story - I have watched it way too many times :)
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Really the best part of the movie was the whole movie except for the ending so about the last 20 minutes they could've done without.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Clever and witty. Love the characters and the writing stays fresh. Oh, and pay attention to the soundtrack references! They tie into each episode beautifully!<br /><br />My only caution would be, this is an adult show, with adult language. I was surprised at first, assuming all USA Network Shows to be like Psyche or Monk. Some viewers might find this to be a distraction, as much of the language is unnecessary. Either way, we are catching up on all past episodes, excited for the upcoming season!
B006JD48NM|5.0|A very gripping & intriguing documentary on the shortened life of a racing icon.  It really portrays the human side of this man.  He seemed like a very determined, gifted and warm individual who carried the whole country of Brazil on his shoulders.  A definite icon who is still missed to this day but helped millions of children throughout Brazil with his foundation.  A must see movie!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Somehow I never knew anything about this show, but I am so glad to have found it now! Love having it on Amazon Prime so I can watch back to back episodes!
B0034G4P26|5.0|I love it, this movie is great.  definitley gonna be one of my all time favorites.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B008220BP2|5.0|First and foremost, Nicholas Hoult deserves a lot of the credit for his performance.  There was a beautiful subtlety to his acting that more than compensated for his lack of lines.  R was a role that demanded an actor who could speak volumes through mostly facial expressions and Hoult pulls it off beautifully.  There was definite chemistry between the two leads that also contributed to the strength of the movie.<br /><br />As usual, John Malcovich brings so much to a small role and Analeigh Tipton shines in the best friend role.<br /><br />The story, while original as a zombie movie, is a little predictable as a romance, but in the end, I didn't really care because the performances were so strong - particularly those of the leads.<br /><br />A fantastic assortment of special features that cover all aspects of the film making make the purchasing of this bluray a no-brainer.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|great movies, except for the crystal skull, which we all know should not have happened in the first place.  but....I really bought this for the rest of them.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|This album is really great! I love listening to the songs all the time. I recommend this to people who love fun.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|Every frame is gorgeous. This whole film is beautifully layered. It is so complex in how it explores the interactions between two worlds -- and people in general
1490313370|4.0|Very good inspirational book.  The book is an easy read that I think most people will enjoy.  I would recommend book to others.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good game, I think it's better than subway surfer. The kids live it too. I think a gru game would be fun.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|This is just what I expected from this group as I recall enjoying listening  to them so many times before.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|i thought it would just be about their marriage and family...but it's so much more and there are so many episodes. it wins awards for a reason!
B008JFURII|5.0|This movie is so great...... I would watch it 100 times and it still would not get old...... the first movie was also great!
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|For those familiar with lemmings, this is a pretty good clone with no evasive permissions.<br /><br />The good:<br />Cute game<br />Easy controls and screen is easy to pan<br />Music is too cutesy for me but fits the theme<br />No internet permissions<br />Probably a lot of levels (played through 8 levels in the first world and there are 5 world's)<br /><br />Not so good:<br />Game takes a lot of resources. I feel this game was programmed for another platform and ported over. It runs a little choppy on the galaxy nexus.<br />Directions a little hard to follow if you never played lemmings.<br /><br />Overall a great game for lemmings fans. A little too cute for me but the little ones might like it.
B000002NJS|4.0|I recently bought Ray of Light, the first Madonna album that I have bought.  Based on it, I have tried Music, Like a Prayer, Madonna,  Erotica, and Confessions on a Dance Floor.  I can recommend Ray of Light to anyone.  I would like to rate it 3½ stars.  Like a Prayer has several good tracks.  Most of Madonna's music, to me, is electronic dance music with a lot of electronic effects which often ruin even the good tracks.  On most tracks, the dominant sound is not her voice but the electronics, which is a problem for me.  I will keep Ray of Light, and I'll hold on to Like a Prayer for a while longer, but the rest of the albums I'll give away.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Yet again Jeffery leaves us with a cliff hanger.....Someone lock him away and force him to finish the next two books to put me out of my misery....As always Jeffery is one of the best story-tellers of out time
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show keeps getting better.  Anxiously awaiting Season 4!!!  This season ended with a real cliff-hanger.  I can't believe they would write this character out of the script!  He's one of the most lovable members of the family!
B005544V6A|5.0|this tv show is witty and smart. A little too dramatic about the relationship though, but smart about law. like.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Throughout the entire book, I waited for something exciting or unpredictable to happen, but nothing ever did, only to come to the end to see that there will be another issue, why buy another uneventful book.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love the books. They are exceptionally visual and easy to read.<br /><br />It's just like watching the show!<br /><br />I've watched the first two seasons three times and the books are just like watching the show again. I've only found a couple (literally) of things I didn't remember from the show!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|To be honest, I only got this game in the beginning because it was free for one day only and the app icon looked cool :) but within the first moments of the game I was hooked. Azada provides a variety of challenging puzzles that tax your mind. The main story line is that Titus overheard his uncle talking about a magic book titled Azada, meaning freedom. Titus got a little too curious, and the book trapped him in a painting. He needs you to solve the puzzles so he can be freed.<br />Most of the puzzles are challenging, but not so much that they are impossible without a genious IQ. My only (personal) problem with the game is the round and round puzzles. *bangingheadonwall* Course, you may be able to solve it just fine. :) Kudos to you if you can!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|didn,t know what to expect so was a visual treat to see the xmen from day 1 to learn about their powers and how to use them, if u are an xmen fan u will like this movie makes me want buy them all (and probably will)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Maybe the best book i ever read, inspiring, funny, heart-warming, and just make  you think about things you probably haven't before. I would absolutely recommend this book to everyone who likes to read. There's a combination of a love story, a story of friendship, a story of hardship within a family, and a story about troubles at school. This is a very well rounded book, and an all around great read, for everyone.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love Rod Stewart and this CD shows off his renditions! There is a good selection of songs! I really enjoy listening to this CD!
B007L4HET8|5.0|this product was as it said, new and never opened. The movie played very good, clear like at the threater.
B00821OX98|4.0|Although somewhat typical &#34;aliens invade the earth&#34;, the acting was fairly well done and the special effects were well done. It got a bit slow at times but I suppose the story has to be set and some folks need their love stories and drama.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|When I first got it, it worked perfectly then after a week it started acting up . So it's alright
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This dragon app is the best one I have played yet. I love how it connects you to fbook, I just wish there was a social wall and add other friends feature, so you could add friends from all over. I still love it and it gets my five stars.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it's a cool game it just freezes too much. I wasn't able to play it the first 5 times I opened the application, but I think it eventually fixed itself or something I did differently.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|This is such a good CD.  I happened to see this on public tv and the show was great also.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is top notch.  The acting is superb, the sets are spot on, and the costuming is beautiful.  I started Downton Abbey expecting to feel very much us vs. them, but I found that I cared about all the characters.  The script is beautifully written and the story lines are engaging.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|These toys are part of a set of toys called octonaust.  My two youngest kids ages six and eight spend hours playing with these toys.  They are a good value for the price.  They are sturdy and hold up well when played with in water too.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|This book is not your average mystery.  I personally liked the discussion about Australia and its legends, but what I found most interesting was the section in which Harry Hole the reformed alcoholic falls prey to his old demon again.  The description is so detailed and vivid that it makes me wonder whether the author had some personal experience.  I plan to read more in the series.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|The game is interesting and fun - would have given it 5 stars. However, when you fail a level it makes you go all the way back to the beginning of the book, and you lose any orb you used to skip a puzzle. Too bad as it is a great game otherwise.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a great, quick game for 4 friends.  We have had a lot of fun with it.  Recommend to people who like a ready mix of luck and skill.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was not what I was expecting at all, but it was certainly a pleasant surprise! I loved, loved, loved it and couldn't put it down! As a precaution: be ready for lots of &#34;f-bombs&#34; and explicit language, and a rather disappointing ending (in my opinion). However, I would recommend it to anyone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really kept me entertained and held my attention. I just wish there were more levels to complete. Fun times!
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|It is a fun game but i cant play online or log in. So it says please close game and update. I did but guess what it didnt work
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I just really love Michael Connelly's books and especially love the character of Harry Bosch!  It is a fast read and you can hardly put it down once you get started.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The most awesome book I ever read I would not stop reading it. 5 star's can't wait to read next book:)
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Intense, riveting and addictive.  This tightly woven saga of manipulation and power jousting suggests everything about Capitol Hill politics is corrupt, but this barn burner does it with such class.  Every talented character oozes a mixed message layer after layer, and one must pay attention for the well played subtleties which betray the illusion of control.  Kevin Spacy hits it out of the park.  His acting is brilliant.  Robin Wright in the skin of her beguiling character is incongruously ruthless and tender within the same frame.  The script is witty and the plot is intricate but plausible.  This house of cards is teetering on the edge in episode 13. Can't wait for more.  Thanks Netflix.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great for all ages and parents are going to love it. It's fun for your kids and they get to create their own village the way they want to
B000DZIGDU|2.0|Every 03 is an idiot except for Swofford?  That was the impression I got from as much of the film as I could bear to watch.  Right from boot camp to 2/7???  Never happens.  ITS is far more interesting than what happens in the boot camp scene. I knew I was going to weapons company before I even got to Horno so what was the point of have some gunny admin pogue make a comment about what kind of name was Swofford? There were things that were similar to what I remember but for the most part the film looked more like an attempt at a comedy sketch.  Anyone saying this is the way Marines are has never been around Marines, period.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun and Iove all the things you can get for your minion you should totally get this app!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed it. I listened to it on audible and suggested it to a bunch of friends. The author did a great job with the twists and turns. It's what they call a page turner.  I thought the narration was wonderful as well. I would definitely recommend it.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|We watched this first Harry Potter movie with our granddaughter who is in the third grade and has started reading the Harry Potter series.  It was very good and according to our granddaughter it followed the book very well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love the app, hate the many ads that are in the game. The really ruin the game experience. Reducing the frequency of them would be a great improvement.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I watch it on my Ipad when I go workout @ the gym and promise myself I won't watch it unless I'm there....I've lost all kinda weight...Can't wait for each episode!!!
B004L03B3S|5.0|This is an excellent love story.  I think one of the most touching parts is the love that the parents show for their boys.  A touching journey from youth into adulthood.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Now I can see why some people rave about this show.  Couldn't watch it for free cause these episodes were too new but worth paying for.  Love that I can watch them when I want to.
B00CW665VI|5.0|LOVED IT!!! Fast, easy read. Very funny....really enjoyed the guys point of view, as if you were having a beer with him and he was telling you a great story. The writing was good, little to no angst & you made me laugh! Would definitely read from this author again!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The only thing that I do not like is that you have to make friends and I have no idea who has kindles. It is not like Facebook.
B00DSOG0QS|3.0|As I've learned from reading Ketkar's other book, Killing Matt Cooper (under a pen name), don't expect a typical and average storyline to be included, which is one of the things I liked about this book. Staged Fright is a suspense thriller about bioterrorism, with a splash of CSI and some quirkiness sprinkled in. All these parts combine to create a funny, entertaining read.<br /><br />As much of a serious topic as terrorism (biological or otherwise), considering the current climate, Ketkar manages to infuse some humor, wit and a little extra that you wouldn't find in other books with the same storyline. The story has a dramatic \\"race against time\\" vibe, but it stands apart with the variable cast of characters that are involved. They are the ones that add the fun in this book. The Callahan clan is not your typical affluent family. Larkin and Tigh are not your prototypical scientists (which you can say the same about their colleagues at the C.D.C). What I find interesting is that amongst the non-typical people in the book, Neil turns out to be most relatable character there is with his feelings of inadequacy and being an outcast (among his school and family). And I know Jack is a musical prodigy, but it was hard for me to take him seriously with him in his \\"prison garb\\" and acting thuggish.<br /><br />I appreciated the detail involved in explaining the science behind identifying biological elements and such. You can tell much time and work (whether through personal knowledge or research) was put into the explanation. However, it got to be a little much for me. It took me out of the flow of the story and made it a little hard for me to get through those passages. Maybe if it was a little more condensed, it may not have slowed down the story and kept my interest. But I do appreciate the detailed narration of those scenes.<br /><br />In the end, Staged Fright was a humorous, quirky, suspense thriller that made for a great read. Ketkar took a familiar plot line and made it into his own. The one thing you can count on from his books is that it's never going to be what you expected.t into his own. The one thing you can count on from his books is that it's never going to be what you expected.
1781162646|1.0|I expected so much more from Stephen King. It was very poorly written and the editing was even worse. Practically the same sentence started paragraphs on facing pages 136 and 137. There were at least two instances where South Carolina was mentioned and it was actually North Carolina. I could go on but I won't. Sorry I wasted my time.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Great film. Brilliantly edited/filmed.<br /><br />Not really sure why more people didn't go see it.  The story is really for everyone!

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Pretty good movie. Ordered for my kids and they like it.  I watched it with them and thought it was a pretty good movie.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A very challeging game.....got me to do some serious thinking.....i am so glad there is a walkthru for it, that i can look up for .....lololol!!!!!!!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Very cute movie. My kids loved it. They watched up 10 times before they rental period was up. So I would definitely say they liked it a lot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You cannot this book down. It's a little slow at the beginning but then you can't stop reading it! A must read.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|SyFy has great shows! this along with the original Stargate and stargate Universe are great! This network continues to excel.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Great tracks. Cole definitely did not fail to respect hip hop! On way to becoming a classic in my rotation.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|In spite of what others say, I like it a lot. A natural continuation of the Star Trek universe if you ask me.
140006922X|5.0|This book is way better than the reviews seem. Very informative and entertaining. Also it's interesting how divided the reviews are. I wonder why that is?
1616614609|5.0|I can't get enough of this game! At the time of this review, I've purchased 2 Core sets (the purchase of the second was from Amazon and why I'm reviewing), and all the expansions out to date (through Creation and Control). I have a friend that I play with several nights a week, and a local game store where I play weekly with a group of people. Lots of strategy and bluffing involved. I'd suggest this card game to anyone who likes strategy games where you get to surprise your opponent with something they didn't see coming. Also, for Ex-Magic players such as myself that want a card game that doesn't require the purchase of random packs, just buy one copy of each expansion ($15-$30 each) and you are set! The only thing you will have to buy multiple of if you want 3 copies of each card (the maximum allowed in a deck) is the core set. I'm already planning on buying a 3rd when I can justify it in my budget!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book explained a lot about why some relations had struggled so bad in the past.  Its amazing how much easier it is to understand what was being said when I wasn't able to see it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love it! Such a page turner! I want more to come out! Great series so sad its the last one
B002SAS26E|5.0|fun, simple, short game.  play it all the time.  my wife really like this one as well. fantastic two player game
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Great season to watch, it was suspenseful and made you want to watch more!! The characters are great and we are addicted to dexter now!!!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Making the impossible look possible. Always in the wrong place at the wrong time. John's adventures always lead to an action packed, kick butt now take names later movie. Great fun to watch!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|It could be simpler to use.  I don't like getting so many messages in my e-mail box.  The search could also be simpler.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|The first Expendables was moderate fun, with an interesting concept in bringing together various action heros of 1980s / 90s movies, but modernizing the action and adventure. Expendables 2 seems to have taken a step back, while more stars have been added to the roster, the action and dialogue seems to be low budget, while the violence and bodycount are so OTT and comedic that you quickly lose interest. The only high point is Chuck Norris basically delivering a joke about himself. Give it a miss.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use the free version and it's very handy but it does not allow you to use an offline version, which IMO is no big deal.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Cassandra Clare is always keeping you on your toes while reading.  So many twists and turn you don't expect.  If you pick up any of the books in this series to start reading them, you want to make sure you have time because you won't want to put them down!!
0321811984|5.0|I read Resonate before I read Presentation Zen. They are both superior books, each different, but each with a fresh look at doing presentations.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|As soon as I picked up this book I couldn't put it down!!  I was instantly dragged into a fast-pased would of Shadowhunters and other fantasy beings.  This whole series really keeps you on the edge of your seat because whenever something good happens, it switches to another character's point of view!!
B00E25KVLW|3.0|Got this by error.  Would like to change for another. It's not something that I would read,sorry for the inconvenience.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Colleen Hoover and I really liked it.  There is very deep topics in the book and not for the faint of heart.  Hopeless also had a twist in it that I didn't see coming but I really liked this book and Sky and Holder's journey through it.
B00821OX98|5.0|I like the storyline and the characters, the intensity of the drama altogether. 5 stars for me. As long as you don't get creeped out by the aliens :)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I have so many feels for this book!  I love this series and this author.  If you pick up the books in this series to start reading them, you want to make sure you have time because you won't want to put them down!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I found it too late.  With only one season I'm left wanting so very much more.  What a fun and smart adventure.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I watched about 10 minutes of the movie and couldn't take any more of it. I was really shocked because a majority of the reviews were positive, but I just didn't like it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is the best game ever. You should try it.Its awesome.Its very entertaining.And I love when you fun into things it doesn't stop you it only slows you down a little bit.I would give it infinate stars if I could!!!!!
B008OM0EDO|5.0|I'm neutral about Sasha Baron Cohen. I've always only \\"somewhat\\" enjoyed his movies. The Dictator, however, was so hilarious that my fiancee and I could not stop laughing. Our abs hurt by the end of the movie. I find the dialogue clever in its own way (i.e. Zoe introducing her store as a non-prejudiced place for people of \\"all or no genders\\"). This movie is jam-packed with humor so much that every time I see it, I find something hilarious....And admittedly, I've watched this move at least 40 times. If you don't like it, you don't have much of a sense of humor. ENJOY!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!<br />I am in love with these little guys!<br />It's graphics are really good too for a free game app (:
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Uhhh yea this game is terrible! It's a complete copy of the original hair salon game! At least on there you have a lot more hair colors and people to choose from! I hate don't buy I do NOT recommend it!!! It's a waste!!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I like to have something to play while riding in the car this serves the purpose for why I ordered this.
140006922X|5.0|I have always found it hard to find factual, unbiased,secular history on Jesus. So much so that I for awhile denied that he even existed. I finally found something that could fill that role. I was happy to find out this is well cited, organized and written. Anybody could read it. Even people who haven't. I am a  person of knowledge, I need to find out this worlds great mysteries, after reading this I feel a little more full now. I received an advanced copy from a friend and I find it kind of hard to believe that there are all of these 1 star reviews. It feels as though someone's feelings were hurt, somehow, and they are lashing out at the author. Anyways. This is a MUST read to anyone who, like myself, has had a hard time finding FACTUAL history on Jesus, rather than magic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to have something to play while riding in the car this serves the purpose for why I ordered this.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like to have something to play while riding in the car this serves the purpose for why I ordered this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|REALLY fun and would recommend to anyone who likes horses. Definitely worth trying out. The activities are suitable for all age groups and both genders, would be good as a kids game or for those a little older.

B00BHWG0DQ|5.0|I just got this 7 disc set yesterday, and haven't had the time to watch all of them, but this is a great collection.<br />It has a great variety of Episodes, that shows  how great this season was. This episode has a great episode Relics, which has Montgomery Scott in it,<br />and the Discovery of a Dyson Sphere.<br />All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this to All Star Trek Fans out there.<br />[[ASIN:B00BHWG0DQ Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 6]]
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have not read the book. I am going to buy it very soon. However, as a matter of principal, I am giving it five stars to combat the obvious review-bombing by those who feel it is their duty.<br /><br />Firstly, I'm agnostic. I don't really believe in a God or care to debate it. He could exist, he could not exist. It's not an important part of my life. Jesus' teachings are pretty swell and he had some decent stuff to say. He's an important figure in history and the truth is shrouded in mysticism and religion.<br /><br />The review-bombing is silly. This is a different viewpoint of Jesus. It doesn't appear that Aslan has any interest in discrediting Jesus or have any hateful remarks toward him. He simply wants to view him as a historic figure, which means he's not going to mention miracles that defy physics. Resurrection defies physics and that requires faith to believe. He is talking purely about him historically and how he was viewed in that time.<br /><br />Y'know, it's good to see things from other perspectives. Ever hear about \\"walk a mile in his shoes\\"? Think of it that way. Aslan is a Muslim who has compiled a different, although common view of Jesus among scholars. That seems pretty cool to me.<br /><br />If you say he is unable to discuss Jesus with his various degrees and very scholarly works, than I would say that anyone who does not have those things and is a Christian has no right to discuss any other religion or lack thereof. Christians have no right to speak of Muslims, atheists, agnostics, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews or Deists. Especially since you have not attended their religious institutions and probably have not read much, if any of their works.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy your stay in Hypocrisytown.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story, awesome ending. Better than Under The Dome! The ending is great and the story never lets up! A must read for all King fans!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Arguably one of the most important films ever made on the holocaust. Not to be missed. Visually bold and stunning, this is a beautiful film.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|One of our all time favorite shows. Clean, not too violent and the writers deserve many awards for their genius story lines. Keeps us intrigued week after week.
B002ZG99N6|3.0|Too violent and gross at times but if you like Jeremy Renner you probably can overlook the action and violence.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This series is a great way to start a Tween down the road of suspenseful law novels. My 9 year old son loves them.  If you purchase on Kindle they can click on unfamiliar words and it will define them.... great vocabulary builder.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I would. recommend  this product. It charges as advertised. I have been very pleased with it and my did met my expectations.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Read all the reviews for this one before you buy it.  I originally had the freebie, decided I might be able to use it , so I paid $5.00 for the Pro 7.  Now, whenever I try to use it I immediately get a request to buy the $14.95 version . . . if I want to enjoy the full range of fonts available.  Each time, I check the box \\"Don't bother me, again.\\" only to have it pop back up the next time I use the app.  You can't even get Times New Roman with the version I purchased.  So . . . in order to get a full working version and a useable selection of fonts for this app you'll end up paying $20.00 plus tax.  Amazon should not allow these people to use Kindle for this kind of sleazy manipulation!!!  I am going to delete the app completely and . . . Mobile Systems, Inc. has lost me as a future customer . . . foreeeevvveerrrrr!<br /><br />MOD
B002RV01QI|5.0|Very relaxing....great to listen to after a stressful day along with a couple glasses of wine!  Keeps u stress free...need I say more?
1400052181|3.0|This book has a great start and gets the reader hooked. After about halfway though, it is exclusively about the author's journey towards finding Henrietta's family and the relationship she develops with them which is great, just not at all what I expected. The book addresses some interesting ethical points about human cells and who maintains rights to them after they are removed from the body. Skloot also discusses laws governing medical practice and how they have changed over the course of 60 years. I also learned a lot about cell biology. On the contrary, the portrayal of Henrietta Lack's life reads like a novel and the author makes it very obvious how serious she has taken her research into Henrietta's life. However, towards the end, it mainly becomes a story of Skloot's relationship with the present day Lackses in almost too much detail (I don't need to know the size and color of the shirt of every newly introduced individual). Overall, just not my genre.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|was very interesting game and like nothing I have ever played I hope new levels come soon very fun some difficult but can figure out
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read! Kept me interested the whole time and I never wanted to put it down!!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Just what I always wanted lol! It's very easy to use and I love that I can download my music from the internet to my phone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for people of all ages. Have had this game in my kindle fire hd for a week and everyone in the family loves this game. So if I was you I would download this game right now and enjoy hours of fun!!!!!!!!!!!  And it's a free game? What else could you ask for?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|We all fear being different. We all want to be beautiful. Some people are beautiful inside, but with strange wrappers.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think this a good app because I'm young i want things like an iPhone iPod touch or an iPad it's like I message you text people all around the world it basically is I message
B00AWKZSNM|3.0|I would like to give more than 3 stars & I think, on the whole, it probably deserves more.  My experience is probably a typical.  I received the iUSB a couple days before going on a road trip. I was able to set it up simply enough & it did well in testing. Unfortunately, my testing was flawed as all I did was make sure my devices could see & play the videos.  What I failed to do was make sure the videos played to completion.  Once on the road, 15 minutes into every movie the connection would drop & the iUSB required a restart to get it to work again.<br /><br />That alone would have earned this product no stars (or the lowest rating possible) were it not for their proactive customer service. They quickly attempted to help me correct the problem & get things working properly.  Ultimately, however, I opted for the refund.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|This is a meandering, bi-polar self help / new age / whatever book. It is all over the place. Some of it is funny and interesting, some of it is just tripe, but mostly, it just meanders around like a blog (which is where I suspect many of the chapters were cut and pasted from).
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is a quick read and full of whimsy. Spooky images of the dual moons and capturing a child's daytime and turning it into curious nightmares.  Truly a fun read.
0446569895|4.0|I have always liked Ozzie, even way back when Black Sabbath started. I thought their music was way ahead of the times and always had catchy music and lyrics. The man himself fascinated me even more. I really enjoyed their show on MTV, but of course, this was Ozzie in his later years. The book was entertaining in that he told everything just as it was and not in a bragging way. He admits he was wrong most of the time with Sharon and his first wife Thelma, as far as the booze and drugs were concerned and what they did to him, resulting in abusive relationships. But at least he was honest. His accident on the ATV was horrible and changed his life for good. I'm sure that the heavy usage of drugs and alcohol have taken a toll on his body and mind as well. But I really enjoyed his book and think most other people will too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game.  Time passes when playing.  This is one of few games that I actually like to play.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Outstanding series!  Am on the 4th season and love it.  Looking forward to next season on Showtime!<br />You can't go wrong with this series.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|They require an incredibly disturbing level of permissions!  access to my accounts?  no thanks.  I don't care if the game is fun or not, they don't need that kind of access to my info.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Say what you want, but if you want accurate, detailed information about the weather - no matter where in the world you're in - then this is all you need. This app is backed by the world-renowned folks at The Weather Channel. Yes, there are other weather apps out there. But this app is about as &quot;straight from the horse's mouth&quot; as you can possibly get.<br /><br />And where do you think many of those other apps get their weather info from.
B0077POH8M|4.0|As other reviewers have said, installing this is really frustrating. You have to keep two tiny pieces in place on each leg of the backplate while you install it on the back of the motherboard. I ended up using scotch tape to keep them on until it was secured and then taking the pieces off. Then, I had to push down unreasonably hard on the cooler (and the cpu) to get its legs close enough for the screws to connect at all. I'm not sure if they were bent back a bit or if that's just how they're designed. When I was done and had everything back in the case, the motherboard was actually warped a little bit from it.<br /><br />In spite of all that, I'd still get it again. It's the only quiet cooler I could find that would fit in my low profile case. The noise is drastically cut down and the temperature of the CPU has been well within safe levels even when running new games. There have been no issues from the slight warping of the motherboard.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|It looks good and easy to use, but it's not working properly with my kindle fire hd. I still couldn't watch you tube and videos. My son is very upset.<br />I don't know how to install flash player? I'll try everything.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|doesn't really work on the Kindle Fire... I finally got upset enough with it that I just deleted the app
B005723JSQ|4.0|Cute story!  Made me laugh, made me cry! It was hard to put down, I wanted to keep reading to find out what Poppy got herself into next. Very likable characters. A little predictable, but that's okay, still enjoyable.
140006922X|1.0|*amazon verified purchase*<br /><br />I bought this book and then I read it before I threw it away.<br /><br />\\"Zealot: The life and times of Jesus of Nazrath\\" says many wrong things, it says that Jesus is not a walking god, jesus was not born from a virgin and didn't rise from the dead, and other RADICULUS things any smart person would know is a lie.<br /><br />Why would somebody say bad things about God?  Hrm, I wonder if its because there's a certain TERRORIST plot against the usa? You think?  Here's the truth the lamestream media ignores: Zealot is written by a MUSLIM.  What next, Obama writing a book about the tea party revolution?  Sorry, nobody will touch it.  Besides Rand Paul is going to write that final chapter in 2016!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is a great tension releaver!  So much fun!<br />Wish I would of found it sooner....love to play and woud recommend to others!
B005USZYDU|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a fast paced mystery with twist and turns. For people who love out of the blue surprises this is truly the book for you.<br />  - Nasir<br />  Salcedo
B0054LJGWS|5.0|A typical Pratchett story, however set on earth.  Loads of unexpected humor, the plot had unexpected turns and kept you guessing.  Well worth the time to read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A wounded soul finds her way through her attention to and passion for flowers!  The book brings understanding to the life of unwanted children shuffling from home to group home to the living on the street or in the woods.  It shines a light on the erratic behavior of lost children who develop mental illnesses which make their lives an unbearable burden.  They flee from life and society in many different ways. In this book the woman's attention to flowers begins the healing of her wounded spirit.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Today so much music is fabricated electronically and classic strings instruments are rare in mainstream music.  Lindsey Stirling found a niche that fits the fabric of modern music and her incredible skills with the violin.  Part techno, part classical, Lindsey Stirling's music has the beat you can dance to but the emotion that only comes with real instruments.<br /><br />In addition to buying this album, you should check her out on YouTube.  This was where I discovered her music and it will draw you in and leave you asking for more!
B009CPRYG2|5.0|The Dark Knights is a wonderful series of animated movies, very dark very gritty very engaging to put it simply this is a pure must watch. I do have to warn any parents this is most defiantly NOT for children. But a must watch for any mature fans!

B008IBPMZG|5.0|Service worked great- a tremendous value.<br /><br />Downton Abbey was great! I love the mix of soap opera dramatics and period accuracy. So fun to get insights into that time in history. I never gave as much thought to the implications of the Great War on English society- it was fun just for that insight.

Mythical ideas are dispelled and replaced by a historical political and factual world view.

B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show, it focuses more on how humanity would be vs the alien invasion part of it, but still good sci-fi

074401493X|5.0|See the full review at Metal Arcade .Net<br /><br />The Last Of Us is a game that hardly needs an introduction. Garnering countless perfect scores from the press (including Metal Arcade), Naughty Dog's PlayStation 3 survival horror game is a bona fide masterpiece. It's also a pretty difficult game. Luckily, BradyGames has released a great companion guide that does a stellar job of aiding players in their quest to survive this post-apocalyptic world.<br /><br />Unlike the extremely polished feel of Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, The Last Of Us is intentionally rough around the edges. Joel is not a master marksman with weapons, and his aiming is as shaky and erratic as the infected populating this dystopian wasteland, which is frustrating yet realistic. You're always low on ammo, and avoiding shootouts is absolutely necessary to survival. There's plenty of moments of utter desperation in the game, where you'll be rushed by a swarm of crazed monsters with only two bullets and a wooden plank to defend yourself with, as your heart threatens to burst out of your chest. Many times all you'll have in your inventory is an empty glass bottle or a brick to use as a distraction. You'll always have to make sacrifices and tough decisions, such as using your alcohol to make a molotov cocktail or saving it for a health pack.<br /><br />Creating the guide took 16 days of playtime, two trips to Naughty Dog's studio, and a ton of back and forth between the two teams. It's \\"the most comprehensive look at The Last of Us you'll find outside the walls of Naughty Dog\\", according to BradyGames. It's hard to question that claim, as during my playthrough of The Last Of Us I had no trouble finding the correct path or stealthily sneaking past the Infected with the help of BradyGames' guide. If you like full walkthroughs, this guide has you covered. If you want just hints and tips when you get stuck, that's here too. The guide does a fantastic job of leading you down the correct path without spoiling any of the major story elements, which was highly appreciated. Everything from detailed maps, informative screenshots and a breakdown of your enemies is included in the guide, alongside sections detailing the collectibles and even the multiplayer.<br /><br />The main guide is broken into twelve chapters.

B009LDD54K|5.0|A lot of people were worried that Jimmy's absence would hurt the show. It didn't. While the first few episodes were a bit slow, it pays off at the end, and it's another great season. The climax of this season has the gangster feel that I would say has been missing from Boardwalk Empire a little bit in previous years. I can't wait for season four!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I liked this very much.  Bought it as a birthday gift for my granddaughter.  Inferno and the Borgias I haven't finished listening to as of right now, so cant give you a review yet.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I took a risk of putting my iPhone 5 into it. My iPhone got scratched quite few places. It does not provide any protection and spring system is hard enough to leave scratch for sure. I consider myself a very careful person. My iPhone did not had any scratch until now :-(<br /><br />I would recommend staying away from this product.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|This was the first novel featuring Harry Hole, but only recently printed in the US. I can kind of understand why. The later books generally are more complex and entertaining
B0010T0QOK|5.0|While traditional Japanese temple staff wear zori or geta with white straps, at our New York temple, we wear white Crocs.  They fit well, they work well, and they are the right color.  Thank you.
B008NMT684|5.0|My son is 2 and absolutely loves cars and trucks.  This puzzle app is great for getting him started on recognizing shapes and putting pieces of pictures together.  He especially loves popping the balloons that celebrate when he's done a puzzle. An added sense of fun is being able to touch the cars and have them spin around on one of the puzzles.
B007XF4J70|5.0|The 70th anniversary of Casablanca (Blu-Ray) is well worth the price. The picture enhancements are light years better than my old copy and the sound is upgraded as well. My friends are amazed at the difference. This is how it was meant to be seen.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It is so fascinating and moving and artful. I wish more shows took a page out of this book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game but am struggling on how to update this on my kindle - no obvious button.....help please.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|really good story lines and characters are relatable which makes it exciting to keep on watching! Not recommended for under 18.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have been told to read this book ever since I finished the Harry Potter series.  Finally, I did, and I was not disappointed!  I can't wait the start the next one!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is awesome exept I dont get redstone when I mine it whith the right pick!  but it was still wprth te money!!!!!
140006922X|3.0|Give me facts backed by facts not just subjective truths.  It was a good read but felt like somethings had to be taken with a grain of salt.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was a breeze using windows 7 PC. I could not use iphone to set it up, but could use iphone to control it after set up. Netlfix picture quality was very nice (I have a 12mbps DSL internet connection). I can fast forward, rewind, increase or decrease volume all using my iphone. I plugged the USB cable to the USB/service port on my Sony TV instead of the power plug that came with it. Apparently the TV USB port supplies enough juice for the device, and I know power will be cut off from the Chromecast when the TV is off.<br />Easy to set up, easy to control, nice picture, inexpensive --&#62; great value
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 its a really good and addictive game, i think it's a really great and awesome game and i strongly think that everyone should try it
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My Grand kids loved it, the dog loved it and we had a good time with it.<br />It didn't leak.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book beginning to end. I wasn't sure if I would like the whole demon slaying thing, but turns out I do. If it wasn't for the love story and twists and turns, I probably wouldn't have liked  it as well. Just when I thought that I had the book ending or the chapter ending figured out hear comes a piece of evidence that changes the whole game. I would defiantly recommend this book.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I was looking for entertainment and that's what I got.  Like it lots!  If you are after meaningful dialogue and smooth plot arcs, this is not your show.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I appreciated how very different this was from Delirium. The first person is well done and the story engaging and nerve wrecking. Beautiful sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is awesome great graphics very cool I really recommend it to anyone it's amazing! You should really get it it's worth it
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|It's a really fun game and it is free so that makes it even better also it is a good game for kids
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|First, a confession: I bought this book to support Aslan (and other religious scholars) who find themselves targeted by those who underestimate the value of asking important academic questions in their appropriate historical contexts. The assumption that a person from a different faith cannot write a meaningful book about a religious figure is misguided at best, and bigoted at worst. I for one am grateful to Aslan for writing what I consider to be a purely academic work on the life and times of Jesus (just as I am grateful for Jefferson's Bible). Not everyone is inclined to agree with everything written in this book. That is not because its author is Muslim, but because this is the nature--and goal--of academic writing. So please, debate the work--but let's be sure that debate is healthy and on point.<br /><br />Second, this book fills an important need for those who are not Christian, but want to understand the faith in a purely non-dogmatic way. I am a comparative religion junkie, but it can be difficult to find books that are written so clearly and, dare I say, passionately, without seeping supernatural overtones. At least... so far. I admit I have one-third of the book remaining.<br /><br />I challenge anyone who wants to dislike this book based on the media commotion surrounding it to at least read the author's note. Download a sample--that should get you started. Read Aslan's story of how he first became acquainted with the story of Jesus. This is not a man who is hiding his faith, or promoting an agenda. This is a boy with a sense of spiritual wonder who became a man with an academic thirst for knowledge. If you share his curiosity, you'll appreciate this work.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Seriously though, this is an awesome movie. I cant wait for it to come out on blu ray and dvd
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My daughter is 7, she loves the sound it makes when she slices fruit! She also likes that she can pause the game.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|good weekend read , I'm enjoying Sophie Kinsella 's story's .easy to read , laugh and cry and a dash of romance
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very good game. I find it a challange working the boards in darkness.  Have fun. I know I have.I have been playing this game for a long time now.  I never get bored with it.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is a A++++ must buy movie to add to your collection. It is so exciting to follow DJANGO and all he had to go through.<br />I don't want to give it away so I will just say that  I will be purchasing it for my own through Amazon  ♥`•..•´`•.•♥
B009LGO88E|5.0|Bought this for playing Monster Hunter Tri Ultimate, Resident Evil Revalations and Monster Hunter 4 when it eventually comes stateside. The added right stick makes a massive difference to the controls. Underwater missions in Tri were brutal and this remedies it completely. Makes Resident Evil a much improved game. Set up is easy, it connects completely through the IR port on the device and 3DS XL. The device is not region locked so it will work on all 3DS XL units worldwide. Battery life is a non-issue, 420 hours according to Nintendo on a single AAA battery. Should also note that while it makes the already large 3DS XL even more bulky, it is still very comfy in your hands and doesn't make reaching buttons on the 3DS XL any more difficult.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It's a good book I recommend it to youngsters very nice and well written I like the book very much
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It's not by any means a classic and doesn't have a lot of depth, but the trilogy was a pretty good page turner. The third was not quite as good as the first two (it felt rushed and sloppy) but over all it was a good purchase.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Everything in the cash shop is ridiculously expensive, so you'll be grinding for days just to get one shop. Lower the bit prices for those shops and characters. I'm not going to touch on how outrageously expensive the shops and characters in Canterlot are. Let's just say you're NOT going to the amount of bits required to get stuff for Canterlot at level 15, have unless you pay real money to get that amount of bits. I have no intention on dropping real money just to get Rarity, which is a required character to finish the game. Consider this game off my kindle.
B000FC13UE|5.0|Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors.  This collection of short stories is amazing and very entertaining.  The story about the Dream Sweeper gave me chills.
0316228583|5.0|I have never read Rowling's Harry Potter books (nor have I seen the films). I'm certainly aware of who she is, and I was curious about this book because she'd specifically written it for an adult audience.<br /><br />This book blew me away. It's a masterpiece that makes me think about Rowling in a different way. She's a brilliant writer who understands the human condition better than most contemporary writers. The fact that she can write this AND the hugely popular Harry Potter series leads me to believe she might be the most gifted writer of our time.<br /><br />The book is not an easy read. There are lots of characters, and she spends time with each. The result is that we understand the characters, and they seem as real (if not more real) than people who populate our own lives. Rowling is like a cynical portrait painter in the way she reveals the complexities of male and female, young and old, intelligent and simple.<br /><br />The plot is less important than the way the characters' decisions and motivations affect the lives of others in their small community. The book is dramatic, compelling, and satisfying if ultimately tragic.<br /><br />In addition, Rowling is a social commentator who paints a picture of life in the early twentieth-first century and how social structures and government policies help and hurt individuals and families. In this way, she is like Dickens and other great writers who illuminated their eras.<br /><br />Casual Vacancy is great literature that will be read for years to come. It's painful, smart, telling, and cruel. It is a deft concoction that mirrors the inner and outer worlds of people and the villages where they live.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could go back and read the good parts anytime !!!  funny how this book is so dark but held your attention!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I must say reading this book brought both joy an sorrow after having following this series for almost 25 years.  That being said...<br /><br />  Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job finishing the series.  He was not perfect, some characters were written a little differently then I think Jordan would have done.  The dialog was at times a little sillier then I think Jordan tended to write but over all he did well.  The battle scenes where are often the hallmark of the WoT books where glorious and well done.  There were some oddities, side story's that I didn't think mattered so much where sometimes given larger parts and others were a little anticlimactic.<br /><br />  This book broke my heart and left me crying unlike any other book I've ever read.  Part of that may be due to having \\"grown up with these characters.\\"  When I started reading this series I was a good bit younger then the main characters, now I am a good bit older.  At times I set the book aside because it was so emotionally charged that I wasn't sure I could continue reading.  To me that's a hallmark of a good book.<br /><br />  If you've loved these characters as I have over the years this will be a hard book to read, but in my opinion well worth it.  Are there things I'm unhappy about? Certainly but I'm not sure there could have been a \\"Perfect\\" ending to this series.<br /><br />The hardest part is with the death of James Oliver Rigney (Robert Jordan)  some questions will always remain unanswered.  SO unfortunately we will never be able to again read and find out.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|After nearly 70 years of reading novels in this genre, I still have fingers and toes left to count those writers whose work I consider exceptional. This one novel is enough to rank Anthony Ryan with the best I have ever read. I will let other reviewers comment on the storyline, but let me say this tale is beautifully written. The characterization is so wonderfully drawn that it effortless to visualize what the characters are doing and feeling. Even minor characters are resonant. I could suggest a few minor flaws--there were one or two typos, and the shift in time sequence was a little confusing a time or two--but this book is to good to dwell on such minor concerns. The story is masterfully carried from beginning to end. I don't know anything about Anthony Ryan other than he has two other e-books available on Amazon, which unfortunately fall outside of my genre of interests, but I hope he provides readers with more work like Blood Song.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|As good as any TV drama series I have seen. The story lines are always compelling and the acting is first rate across the cast.
1250012570|5.0|Awesome book! I loved it. It has a great sense of humor and an amazing plot. Highly recomend XD :)
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|it is still one of the best movies experience you can have, and even if it has quite an old look, specially in the first one, it does look great in dvd. and the visual effects are just right.<br />Raiders of the Lost Ark, is a case study on the modern blockbuster. it shows how to introduce a character right, how they can still be human, and even be a little prick. Dont read Save the Cat, study this film instead and the script, and you will know what makes a good movie, a block buster and specially what today's action summer flicks are missing, how to make the movie keep making money for generations, and not b e forgotten in the first summer.<br />The temple of doom, is an okay movie, the new characters are really annoying and shows how personal life can affect a filmmakers vision of a film.<br />The Lost Grail is a good movie, and has quite interest action pieces. also the characters are better defined, specially the villains, compared to the previous film.<br />The Crystal Skull, could have been a respectable movie, but to be honest My feeling in this movie is that the sensibilities of Spielberg and Lucas collided all over the place, and didn't let the storytelling be what drove the movie. I specially feel that Lucas is  the cause of most of the films bad action sequences, that seems to be just there to be funny and different and showcase CGI, the way the Star wars prequel were made.<br />In overall, i recommend the box set, these are just the representation of a classic character in some very good movies, with very highs and lows but still worth examining. specially by comparing the scripts and story behind each one.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|This movie has you wondering if everyone is going to remain safe or not....Helen Hunt is good in this movie and I enjoy watching this DVD....If you like Helen Hunt and wonder about tornadoes this is a movie you would want to see.
B00BRBIA6C|3.0|A somewhat disappointing effort from Agentha after a 9 year break from recording. By her own admission, her voice was quite rusty, so she had to take lessons again to learn to breath again in the correct way that singers do. Not to worry, Auto-tune will fix any flat parts. You can spot it throughout this album. Auto-tune is the worst thing to happen to the recording world because it can fix lots of errors, but the downside is that you can spot it.<br /><br />So besides that, we have an album full of simplistic songs, nothing complex. Such predictable melodies, and only a couple of tracks which could be released as singles. Agnetha's Swedish accent is quite obvious on this album. While I realise she no longer speaks English well, I found it a slightly irritating.<br /><br />Her voice is still nice to hear, but you can tell there has been assistance.<br /><br />Highlights from the album include: I Should have followed you home, I was a flower and I keep them on the floor beside my bed.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Very current, good story line and very good cast. Wish each individual show was longer and the law was followed a little more closely.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|From the 5 year old to the 60 year old, we loved this movie. My wife and I watched it AGAIN after the grandchildren left (and we're serious folks). Saw it after DM2 at the theater. They're both great. Can't wait for the next!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's like this game. It's fun and keeps me thinking. If there was a hint button that would be helpful.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|All I have to say is this movie is perfection. And you may need a box of tissues because it does get a little sad at one point.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I know a lot of people like to compare this to glee because of the singing. Honestly I see the resemblance. The thing is, this has so much more. It's something I can watch with my dad (who cannot understand my adoration for glee but loves this as much as I do). I think what gave this an \\"it\\" factor for me was the cute romance between the two main characters. The comedy was a definite bonus.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I could not really stand \\"The Collectors\\" though you do need to read it for the background in this book.  Which closes some things that happened in that book.<br /><br />This one  was not stop action from beginning to end and less descriptive which made it that much mmore interesting.  I loved the plot twists and I could not put this one down.  I think that the author got this one right.  I was hooked from page 1 to the last page.  I like the character development and the fact that, yes some of the good guys get killed.  It was good to see that Alex Ford actually had a good part in this book considering he is an honorary member of The Camel Club.  While in the last book he had like one or two pages worth of time in the book.  To me, the books are about Ford and Stone.  Everyone else is in the background for the most part.  It played off well in this one and I hope to see Ford in the remaining series.  So not saying much of anything, please read this book.  It is excellent!  A page turner and I love the ending.  Not as predictable as the last book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved The Kite Runner and someone told me this was better!  They were right although it's close because the Kite Runner was so good.  As was the previous book, this is sad and joyful, touching and full of wonderful descriptions.  Mostly, you can see a hint of what it's like to live in that part of the world.  Absolutely, you must read this!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Although it's best for the reader to have read the preceding stories in the Sigma Force series to appreciate the character development in this plot, it would be a great read even if you didn't know the characters. I appreciate his research in both history and science to bring together a believable plot with great characters.  This book was certainly among his top stories.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this season of Suits. I am addicted, and can't stop watching!  I'm burning through the episodes like its my job!  It has been an even more amazing watching experience for me, because it has helped me become a better lawyer.<br /><br />2 thumbs up and a 5 star rating!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 8 year old son loves this game! He has played it every day for over a week since we got it!
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Fun addictive game.<br /><br />Well worth a few bucks for the  entertainment!<br /><br />Brings you back to Atari days when games were simpler.
B0031KE9C6|4.0|Love this show. We are addicted to it so when the dvr does not record we buy the episodes we miss.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is easy to use this program, and also the gui is aesthetic and functional. This program makes reading easy and helps the understanding by pasing in others paragraphs easily.
B003VVAE4W|4.0|We love this show. We watch this show everyday. I am glad it is available on instant video. Veronica Mars is funny.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Absolutely could not put this down. Totally didn't want to put it down until finished.  Would make an outstanding movie.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Both believers and non-believers of post life philosophy will be gripped by this specialist doctor's out of body experience when he survived an impossible six day coma to recover completely with amazing memories of his journey. Each alternate chapter talks first to believers then to medical experts who have ignored OBEs for decades. It's a book you can't put down and can't refute as he himself has shaken the trees of all the arguments. Buy now to relax your fears about death and dying.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Written when Vince was in cancer therapy, I believe, this might not have been his best but was still Mitch Rapp as I,ve grown to love him.  Looking for some one to continue the Rapp series in Vince's memory.
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|This is so similar to the 1982 remake of the original that you could close you eyes and imagine you are watching that movie, substituting Mary Elizabeth Winstead for Kurt Russell. No surprises, slow, plodding dialogue, etc. Pretty good special effects but that's about all there is to recommend this movie.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|We have multiple Kindle Fire HDs and our favorite app, that we would suggest to our friends, was The Weather Channel app.  Not anymore friend.  The redesign might have appealed to me if I were under the age of 10 but this is now just a mess.  The horrible attempt at adding color to the app looks like a result of a child eating a bunch of construction paper and glitter and throwing it up on the &quot;app designers&quot; desk and him just saying...umm....okay!<br />Will be deleting this horrible, hard to navigate app, on all our tablets if not UNredesigned.<br />If YOU are  looking for a easy to use weather app and are above the age of 10, look elsewhere.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  While it has a lot of action and suspense, it is uniquely crafted that both guys and gals should be able to enjoy the movie.  Bruce Willis is good in his action setting  but not the all out gung-ho role he seems to play.  This one is a bit more crafty, and the likes of stars like Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich adds even more intrigue.  All the cast members seem to feed off each other and make the movie very enjoyable for all to watch!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I really can't say anything more about this film. Honestly feels redundant to rate it, but here we go.<br /><br />5 stars. Watch it.
B00D3LA5WG|2.0|I didn't even finish the movie. (not a spoiler) I got to the part where 14 year old Ellis punched the senior high school kid in the face without consequence. SORRY but, where I come from & any where else on earth, THIS MEANS WAR!!! I won a fight with a senior as a freshman because I had an altercation with his disrespectful girlfriend who picked my pocket & tried to play me like a sucker. But I was scared to death & thought I was going to lose. But I ended up having the better hand skills cause I used to always slap box with a golden gloves boxer, who I grew up with & who taught me the basics. Plus I was fast & athletic. But NEVER would I just punch a senior in the face unless it was my sister that he was assaulting. & No way in HELL would a freshman ever punch me in the face without getting his ass handed to him! Or at least me trying to hand him his ass. That punk just took a punch to the face from a freshman, no less! & took it like the fonze did it & u just have to take it. BULLS***!!! That's 1 strike against this movie. There better not be any more strikes like that or I will stop watching & trash it! That was a MAJOR problem!!! At least have a scuffle then someone break it up. No self respecting dude just takes a punch in the face(from a smaller freshman kid) & does nothing about it! WTF??? What world is this??? Who wrote this part??? Some girl??? Who has no clue about guy code???
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|this guy needs to do way more research. i think he is at about a 4th grade reading level. seriously terrible.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Growing up with classical music/operas in our home since age 2, Quartet was a breath of fresh air. The movie was magical from the start. The setting, the actors, the premise of the movie as being a home for retired musicians in their later years, British humor, the vocals, the pianists and all musical instrument perfection was a joy to behold for me.  Dustin Hoffman, in this his Directorial debut, did a masterful job, and I would bet big money that he enjoyed every minute making this film and his association with the musicians made famous years earlier in being the best and brightest of their craft (as he brought many of the original vocalists and musicians into this movie). I loved every moment of this movie.  Kudos!
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Interesting twists in plot,, is rather violent but does have a storyline. Acting is very good. I really like the young man, Jackson.
0765356139|5.0|What an awesome series. This book is a lot different from the first, but carries the same extraordinary feel and sense of adventure the first left you with. This one has everything! Action, adventure, mystery, love, loss, twists, and great characters. The first book was a bit lacking in character development for the friends and partners of the protagonists, but this one does it a whole lot better. The first book also started of a lot slower than Well Of Ascension, so put that in the list of improvements. Also, Sanderson seems to have a better feel for all the characters overall, the protagonists are a lot more likable and real and it's lovely to read.<br /><br />Sanderson sure knows how to get tension brewing when he needs to, it becomes hard to stop reading sometimes. Mistborn reminded me a whole lot of an awesome comic book/graphic novel in terms how the story developed and the action that followed. Well of Ascension on the other hands has a Star Wars/Lord of The Rings type of feel for most of the novel with a bit of mystery thrown in and some unforgettable actions scenes that Star Wars and LOTR lack. That's another thing this book improves upon, the action. Jeez, it was so incredibly cinematic, I felt the scenes come alive as I read and felt like a kid again, imagining a world where I could have these powers. The action here can hold up against most anything you can compare it to and honestly, it's probably a lot better.<br /><br />So, as I read, I'm questioning everything that is happening because the whole time, Sanderson is kind of hinting that something is off and it creeps you out throughout and it's great. The ending is great and the adventure is a superb one and I can't wait to start the next book because this one was so terrific. READ IT!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this for the kindle fire hd.  Works good and it is free.  A necessity for any device.  I like it a lot.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Really engaging historical fiction made me want to keep reading initially to follow the drama and from then on got more into the history unfolding.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|and I think people should actually read it before they criticize it. I am disgusted by people who are criticizing the author's religion. As if an educated person can only write about their particular faith. And Jesus Christ lived and died as a Jew. I wish these people who say they are educated Christians could remember that before they spout off their narrow minded rhetoric. But I digress, read the book. It's fascinating.
159562015X|1.0|Buyer beware, of course, but I never thought to ask the questions, &#34;does this book come with a code that will allow me to take advantage of additional online resources? and will that code be missing in a this used copy?&#34; Oops.

0345536886|5.0|Never knew Grisham's sarcastic humor.  Drama, great characters, and funny as hell! I can't remember laughing out loud with a book for a while.  Great scenes, great read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my sister plays this and she urged me to try it.glad I did..really had fun playing this game...one of the best ive played
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Love this song so much! I am excited about Daft Punk's new direction. Hoping for more 70s mashups! Keep it up!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love the game. It's fun to play ,u get to go around the world compete against friends. But on my kindle when I first start playing it gets slow and glitchy . (Needs to be fixed in an update or something.
031286504X|4.0|If you are among the few like me that saw the movie first and then read the book, I think you are in for a treat. Just go into it with an open mind that it has a very different ending.<br /><br />Matheson shines his brightest when describing this scary, lonely world and getting into and staying inside the head of Neville.<br /><br />Here is a quote from Neville after three years of battling vampire/zombies and then finally meeting a human who he wasn't sure he could trust:<br /><br />\\"It had become easier to murder than to hope.\\" If you like this quote, this book will not disappoint.<br /><br />It is a short novel, about 170 pages, and easy to read. The middle chapters slow up some, but the beginning is great, and the end builds a steady tension. Also, a number of short stories are included in the book (click on book to see table of contents).<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This app is so awesome it is great!!! It works on the kindle fire HD!! Great for kids and adults!! Great game!!
B003UMW69I|5.0|Love about anything Sandra Bullock does, and this one is great.  LOVE the scene in the woods where she's dancing like &#34;Grandma&#34;.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|As a long-time Michael Pollan fan, I looked forward to reading his new book, and was not disappointed. He follows his common structure format by telling stories about cooking using the format of the four basic elements - Fire (barbecue), Water (soups & stews), Air (bread) and Earth (fermentation of vegetables, beer and wine). It was a enjoyable read, and, like all Pollan books before this one, taught me many new things about agriculture and food. I highly recommend it.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|That seemed to be the question when this first came out.  Then, when my girls were old enough for it, it happened again!!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I have enjoyed my time playing this game so far.  Keeping my interest.  Good graphics.  Will keep playing for awhile.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the way the stories were woven together. each character  brought a rich culture and their own perspective.  An enjoyable read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was my first locked room game and I loved it.  Challenging enough to enjoy but not to a point were it became frustrating. Looking forward to more levels.
140006922X|5.0|I had no intention of reading this book as I do not particually care about the biblical or the historical Jesus... (an athiest here) but after seeing how well Reza Aslan handled himself while being \\"interviewed\\" by Laura Green of fox \\"news\\" I am going to buy a copy today.  Can't wait to read it.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great game - I found it easier than &#34;Can you escape&#34; but still enjoyed.  High quality app - challenging without being frustrating.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It keeps telling me i need to upgrade but it wont on my kindle it is very aggravating.  Other then that. I think it does what you want it to.
B008NSNYM2|4.0|Good character development. Woolf's staggering writing style jumps off the pages.<br />Well recommended  tale of intrigue,passion, reserve, restraint, unrequited love,& disguise...confusing, at times.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Very easy to download and play my granddaughter has had hours of fun with this app! Get it today for lots of fun. Make sure parental controls r on because it does have items for sale. ( not needed to play)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Highly recommended!! A must see!!<br />Loved the first season and the second will not disappoint. Can't wait to watch season 3.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I was thrilled to get my new bike & be able to get a seat for my 17 month old daughter. These at appears petite at first glance, but works great when installed & she is in it. It's not meant to be a high-back seat like a highchair, but instead goes to about her shoulder blades, & the seat has plenty of room to go for her. I only wish I had gotten it sooner. Our first ride ended with tears b/c she didn't want to get off, lol. I call that success!<br />I have a women's 26&#34; beach cruiser style bike, and this went on very easily & securely.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I'm seven months pregnant with twins and on bed rest.  I'm completely addicted to this game and it gives me some adventure to my daily life :)
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|at first I thought it would be stupid and I was pretty much right cause I cant even tilt the car so I just die and cant even get past level one, I have this on kindle fire so don't waste your time downloading it

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|this game is really fun but once a advertisement comes up and I click exit it still brings me to the dam site and I have to exit from that then come back to the game but also it takes to long to get points to where you can play matches I don't like waiting 40-50 minutes just to only play two matches..

B00571F26Y|4.0|This book does a great job explaining why so many people have developed an intolerance to gluten and it convinced me that even though I do not seem to suffer from gluten intolerance, I still would like to get wheat out of my diet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is so well written, so suspenseful, and is definitely one of the best books I've ever read.  Couldn't put it down. MUST READ!
140006922X|5.0|An excellent look at a pivotal historical figure! The controversy is overblown and intellectually dishonest. I hope to see more from Mr. Aslan!
B006LSZECO|5.0|&#34;Gone Girl&#34; is a novel that grabs your attention from the first word and keeps it until the last.  It is suspenseful, twisted, crazy, and amazing!  Gillian Flynn gets inside the heads of everyone who has ever had thoughts of revenge that take one to a very dark place.  She explores the mind of a psychopath almost a little too well! ;-)  Great read!!
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I mean, Spock, am I right?<br /><br />This season has that one shot where the Enterprise blows up, and that shot must have cost a fortune because they pretty much made an entire episode revolve around that shot. Spoiler alert: It was Kelsey Grammer's fault.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Eleanor and Park is very refreshing.  I like all the interaction with the main characters.  I also like the differences with their families.  The good thing about this book is all the characters are \\"not perfect\\" like the real world we live in.  My favorite is Park.  I know this is a YA book but this book can be enjoyed by readers of all ages.  I love it!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought the book after finishing the Netflix series. I was shocked by the ending of season one and wanted to see if the real Piper was capable of the actions portrayed in the last episode.  thankfully the woman wo wrote this book is much more thoughtful and compassionate.<br /><br />I found her description of how she navigated thirteen months in prison very inspiring.
0062255657|3.0|I'm a diehard Gaiman fan, but this book tries too hard for too little. The early pages beautifully introduce the main character and give a great feel for his life, but later the book turns into the kind of climactic storm Gaiman has created better in quite a few other works. I wouldn't want to have missed this book, but it's not my favorite.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|I'm not sure that I agree it's a 'new' classic or one of the best horror movies as of late, but I enjoyed it quite a bit anyway. Lots of creepy, make you jump moments and a bit unpredictable at times. Well cast and not too many slow spots. I was a little disappointed about some of the business with the Warrens- for instance, if I recall correctly 'Annabelle' the doll actually physically attacked people according to one of their books, yet they stayed away from it in the movie. Also, I would have liked more of an explanation of just what happened to Lorraine to get the Warrens so rattled, past their vague explanation.<br /><br />All in all an excellent movie for anyone interested in the Warrens or who are fans of good haunted house stories and worth the watch.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It took me many pages into the book to become really involved. As the story evolved, one becomes a part of their lives, degrading the sound of the bell. As the mother's plan develed the book was hard to put down. A good read!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun and challenging! not like the other games this one makes you think! love that its kinds like detective work'
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have had this app for about 8 months now, and I have tried most of the solidarity app and none compared to it.
0440246016|3.0|I recently finished re-reading Bad Luck and Trouble a second time.  I still marveled at the beginning and the very original hook in the story, but I didn't enjoy the story the second time around as much as I usually do when I re-read a book.  I probably won't re-read this book a third time until much, much later and I have nothing else I want to read then.  The plot is fairly mundane and the resolution is swift and violent a la an eye for an eye.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I really enjoy this one. Very relaxing and fun to play.  Would recommend it. Great for children learning their numbers too.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|this movie is full of cliche's and action movie references. if you grew up watching these guys this movie is for you
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am not quite done but the first experiment and had amazing results.  I repeated it and again, amazing results!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very similar to temple run. Very fun. Definitely worth the down load. Will occupy plenty of.time and is fun.for adults and kids
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like this series, but after watching the first few episodes, I was hooked.  Now I can't wait for season 4 to start up.
140006922X|5.0|A wonderful historical account of Jesus, the man.  NOT AN OPINION PIECE!  Who cares about the religion of the author, except right wing nuts who are Christian.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's ok could better if you could buy things it's to hard because everything is expensive and if the unicorns didn't cost gems it would be great
B0012TWRAO|5.0|only thing to complain about is a little chipping of the paint on the bottom of the ball. Would recommend
0743527305|5.0|I found I couldn't sit down and read this as a story or novel; I read it in sections and loved it.  I also liked &#34;The People of the Lie&#34;, but you need to be a brave realist for that one.
B00338QENI|4.0|Amazing that Henrietta Lacks lives on and continues to contribute to scientific research world wide. Unfair how her family didn't gain financially from ill obtained specimen....
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|When I got onto a server no one was gossiping,no one tried to kill me,so life is good.Very  detailed graphics.Love the game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Historical verses fiction, romance and adventure complete with deceit and evilly crafted sibling rivalry. Costumes according to the era and the scene makes one want to live at Highclere Castle. Absolutely love this series!
B009NY43NY|1.0|It took me awhile to read this since I waited for the library copy, and I was so surprised.  All the one star reviews about who Sookie end up with or her \\"HEA,\\" are accurate but didn't really convey this mess.  I was still unprepared for a voice that sounded like Sookie on Thorazine - who DID write this?  Even her thinking patterns are different - dulled and mulled over.  It was grating, like nails on a chalkboard.  The longest consideration Sookie gives to ANY decision she makes in this book seems to be between wearing a short skirt or jeans with her fab cowgirl boots. Bizzare and disjointed.<br /><br />But the worst, absolute worst thing - and this is a spoiler, but there have been so many I don't see it mattering.  Sookie does NOT end up with Sam!! Sookie has some nice, warm bodied sex with Sam, and that's it...once.  There IS NO HEA.  NONE! ZIP! NADA!!!  We can assume that that MAY happen with Zombie! Sookie but seriously?  This Sookie is more upset she hung up on someone than that Eric had done what he did.<br /><br />So, then Sookie thinks maybe by Christmas she'll have feelings for Sam.  Whaaaaaa?  kind of icky and just a huge dissapointment!  I don't care if Sookie likes Sam (although the reviewer that said Harris made her into Arlene, trailer included cracked me up and is right) but SHEESH!!!  Can we have a little LOVE here?  Passion?  anything?  Well, no actually.<br /><br />And that is the BIG VERY BIG F_Y that Harris thinks she can get away with here.  Yep they're her characters, yep, the first 3 or 4 books - up to the hotel scenes - were good. But I don't care who in the WORLD CALLS ME ENTITLED!!!! after TEN YEARS of reading these books.....I did not want to be crapped on.<br /><br />The books might as well have not happened.  The magical mystical world Sookie opens up, ends up with - I'm a freak, I don't wanna be a freak, so I'm going to choose the least freaky guy I know...and I've known him all along.  So...what was the point?  The whole wide world building played out with people trying to insert philosophy here and all it really was about was a waitress decides to settle for her boss at a dive bar/restaurant?<br /><br />Is this some kind of alt. Wizard of Oz?  There's no place like home - and so she perilously left her own back yard, and ends up crying in a gazing ball, Sam, Oh, Sam....I'll never leave again?<br /><br />It makes my head want to explode.  She's no wiser, empathetic, skilled - nothing! - for having had her world stretched beyond her comprehension, and her background revealed?  She just wants to -waaaah - know why people don't like her and want to kill her? O.M.G.<br /><br />WHAT. WAS. THE. POINT????  to all that?<br /><br />I have to assume it was crass, unapologetic money making.  And that is wrong on so many levels.  Wish I'd never bothered with the first one....and btw, give me Anita Blake any day: she still is all about feelings and as weird as it goes, she does NOT phone it in.  Anita still kicks ass and is consistently freaky, lol.<br /><br />I will not be surprised if in her follow up Harris has Sookie with someone new, or old - but not with Sam.  You know, just because she can show the world how they're her characters!  But I won't be buying it to find out.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />I bought your books, you entitled author, why wasn't it enough to make you happy because you are rich off people just like me - those early adaptors who read \\"paranormal\\" before \\"paranormal\\" was a genre.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have found this app to be very useful on my kindle fire.  I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to a friend.
B000784WMW|5.0|I saw this version as a series on TV when I was a teenager (in the 1980s) and fell in love with this show.  I am a great fan of English novels and I read a lot of classics.  This is my favourite book and I guess the reason I love this show more than any is because it sticks to the book most closely.  The narrative in the show is almost the same as the book.  I have seen many adaptations of this novel (both older and newer ones) and still consider this to be the best one.  Anyone who is a fan of this book should at least see this version once.<br /><br />Timothy Dalton as Mr Rochester does not hurt either!  It really does not matter if some people think he is too good looking to be Mr. Rochester.  I think both he and Zelah Clarke did a great job portraying their characters.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have found this app to be very useful on my kindle fire.  I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to a friend.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome show, love the cast and characters. Just the right amount of funny with drama. Highly recc for anyone looking for a new show to binge on!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love being hooked on a game this is one you should consider, it's addictive and fun, I play it almost everyday now
B0017APPT8|5.0|This Movie was a Very Good Process Both to Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Speilberg My Favorite Scene Happens to be the Car Scene Very Underrated Overall a very great Pulp Fiction like Story but These are Agents Not Criminals.
1451627297|5.0|this was one of the best books I have ever listened to. You are immediately drawn into the journey with the characters. I could not wait to get into my car on the drive to and from work every day to see what was going to happen.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I purchased this for my husband and found myself caught up in this modern day take on mythology. Well done movie.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|Every time I select level 1 to play it says &quot;loading...&quot; then just closes.  No error, no warning, nothing, just closes.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|enjoyed it so much bought this DVD to give my aunt! long, detailed telling of GH's life; really opened him up to me; he's the Best Beatle !
B002MY9NF0|4.0|The art direction in &#34;Dune&#34; is terrific. It's arguably one of the first films with a &#34;steampunk&#34; aesthetic, although I don't know if the term was used in the 1980s when it was made. This is really the only reason to see the movie. The script has its moments but is mostly awful, and fans of Frank Herbert's book will be disappointed if not downright appalled, particularly with the liberties taken at the end. With the exception of Kenneth McMillan's demented and grotesque Baron Harkonnen, the performances are mostly flat, with Sean Young as Chani and Kyle McLachlan as Paul Atreides. Worth it for fans of the book who are curious to see the characters and settings spectacularly visualized for them by Anthony Masters (also the production designer for &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34;).
B0051XQI84|1.0|I purchased this originally for $6.99, for several weeks it is not viewable ... Amazon tech support said Amazon lost their license to stream the movie.  I had to contact tech support a second time and get a refund which is supposed to show on my Credit Card in 2-3 days ... If they ever do get the license back I noticed the new purchase price for the movie is now $9.99 ... not too happy about this .... the movie itself is great so this is not so much a product review as it is a service review
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Good movie, with (a few) solid and original laughs.  This film borders on greatness.  On one hand, the laughs are tepid in the first 2/3, but on the other hand, there's a great pay-off in the final 1/3 (with perhaps, the funniest finale I've ever seen).  I suppose if you accept the idea of (comedic) denouement in a comedy (with story and character development building up to a climax), then this film is near-perfect.
0385341008|1.0|I hated this book because of its formatting. The letters are hard to understand because there are. So many different characters. By the time I knew them the book was over.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Great Movie! Not the best QT film, but def up there in the top five. Fun movie to watch. The &#34;tooth dr&#34; is hilarious!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|The movie is great!!!!!!!!!!  Only problem was with blu-rays (3D version)..would play in my laptop... took a couple of returns but finally got one that worked!
B004HV54TU|3.0|Mouse design is good although expensive. But the rubber material is definitely NOT good. It rubs off and your palm ends up smelling rubber. It would definitely be much better if the black rubber section was replaced with normal plastic as in a typical mouse.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Does what it says it does. Haven't had any problems running on my Droid Razzr Max with 4.1.2. Gets my butt outta bed ;-).
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very smart show!  The characters are awesome and each episode is riveting.  I only wish season 3 was available.  I would highly recommend it to those that enjoy a really smart series.
B002M87V0A|5.0|Fabulous performances by all of the players, especially Robert Preston! Great music, fun story, superb choreography...what else do you need!
B001C34HUS|5.0|Reading this book helped me realize that I have practiced these steps unconsciously for years as I prepared worship experiences for e churches I have worked for.<br />Understanding the five steps will help me get results quicker as I can deliberately and consciously pursue each step. Great logical material!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not a fan of English version shows but my daughter made me watch the first episode. I was addicted and fell in love with the show. Offers a great look into the old English life and is filled with &#34;humor&#34;, suspense and sad times as well. I ended up watching the entire three seasons in four days! My favorite quote from the show is &#34;What is a weekend&#34;! Don't miss it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app  I play it everyday on my kindle fire and I have some news those of you who say you can't got the newest updates just go to settings and turn on the  automatically install updates. I have 0.7.1 since the day it came out. Those of you who want to buy this app  get the full version it's totally worth it. The lite version has so many bugs and you can't even craft! So if you are looking to get this app get the full version, and those of you who are complaining about not getting the updates follow my advice and stop complaining! I can't wait for 0.8.0 I've herd a lot about it and can't wait to play it.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that has greatly outdone, and will greatly outlive, the book it was derived from.  Does anyone really remember \\"Red Alert\\"?  I have read this book, and can see the seeds of both \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and the movie \\"War Games\\" with Matthew Broderick in \\"Red Alert\\".<br /><br />Some consider the Pink Panther movies to be Peter Sellers' greatest showcase, but I like his three characters in Dr. Strangelove better.  If you watch the final scenes carefully you can see Peter Bull (the actor who played Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky) trying very hard not to laugh at Peter Sellers.  He almost loses it.  This is perhaps the greatest tribute to Sellers' comedic talents.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Face it if you liked seasons 1 & 2 you'll find this equally captivating.  Some story lines resolved, others with twists and a host of new ones for season 4
B003O86FMW|4.0|In the first book Suzanne did an award winning job at describing the games and what Katniss saw and did. This one was more rushed and not as descriptive. It was as if Ms Collins got too excited about the story and forgot the details. It was still an amazing book!
B001AR0D4A|2.0|The Dvd pkayed beginning to end only one time.  After numerous times trying to replay chapter 18 I just gave up!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love minions, then you will love this game!<br />Minion Rush is a great stress reliever, especially when<br />you go XXL and get to smash everything in your path<br />muh, wah, ha, ha, ha!!!<br />Great to challenge your friends for high scores!!!<br />Would definately recommend and I have already!!!
0307277887|5.0|This book goes deeper then what the ShowTime series could  I recommend it to anyone who has watched and enjoyed the Dexter show time series sad it's ending this year but the books will give you the opportunity to stay in that world just a little longer.  and not end up on Dexter's table :)

B0094K1K42|4.0|Written by same writer/director as Juno, this is a much grittier movie than advertised. My hub and I both liked it.

B00A5IXI7O|4.0|This is a great, more funny thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. I rented this after I saw a play adaptation locally.
B000JCQCW4|4.0|The title is on the mark. We are raised by the media and our dreams are sad, empty, and destructive.
0451196716|5.0|I believe another reviewer stated they figured out the winner early on in the book.  I also thought I knew who the winner had to be fairly early into the book, however it did not detract from the story (for me).  I also enjoyed the forward (The Importance of Being Bachman) which helped me appreciate the ending.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|Didn't think it was funny at all.  Rambled on incessantly about something to drive it into the ground. Some sentences were a paragraph long.

B00C4QM09W|5.0|Great looking video & great audio.<br />Anyone & everyone would get my recommendation for this movie.  It's one of my favorites.
0316228532|2.0|Tedious, boring - and a real chore to finish, which is unusual for me.  Kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|A beautiful movie that naturally and unpretentiously pictures the blending of love and music in a special place called Dublin.

B003F3PMYI|3.0|This is an easy read with a positive message.<br />It would do many people good to read it, but I've heard much of what this says before.<br />Certainly not a waste of time.
0143120530|3.0|I haven't read it all, but so far it is informative and somewhat helpful..I will give it another try.An amazing bibliography.
B0036UMM84|5.0|It was my favorite movie back in the 70's and watching it now reminded me that I loved it all over again.
B003XZ0WPM|5.0|This film is astounding in it CG images and human acting.  A must-see as a family night film; I don't believe you will regret it one bit.
0375869026|5.0|You must read this book!  A terrific ant-bullying message appropriate for all ages, especially middle school.  Told from multiple points of view, the characters are interesting and realistic.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|you can only play the game once and it says there's not a huff free space realy bad game<br />worst game
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I disliked  the characters. I thought the whole book  was difficult to understand as it went into court time and real life for Jacob's family. The books underlying evilness disturbed me.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never had watched any of these.  Now I can't stop.  Love season 1 and working my way through season 2
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This is a much more enjoyable version of The Bachelor - some cunning trists but someone really will get married!  And it means so much more in the end!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is awesome!!! I love it!!!!!!it is for kids that like to have fun ....it is sort of like subway suffers... but it is still very fun so I think if you are fun or you like subway suffers get it!!!!:)
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I got the Kindle version, I like the examples and the instructions but wish the paper version was not so expensive. Thinking of getting the second version.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have never read any of Orson Scott Cards work before this. I was familiar with his name and was always tempted by his work. I read this book and was pleasantly surprised at the depth to which it drew me in. I am an observer of the human condition and what he wrote here was fascinating.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Big fan of this movie, have been for years. Was happy to see it in a hard case. Well packaged, nice hard case, fast shipping.
B003PIUC02|3.0|There were not nearly enough naked men to make up for the very slow plot.  The fight scenes are just the same over and over and over.  I would not buy it again.
0486407217|4.0|This book had many excellent patterns in it, providing you know how to adapt them from the page. I was disappointed that the one pattern that I really wanted was not in it-namely the one on the cover. The Victorian Riding Habit that is rendered in red pencil with the model wearing a top hat was the one that I particularly wanted and it was not among the patterns inside of the book. However, there is a very good representation of dresses from different seasons and for different occaisions. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the ladies costumes of the period or wanting to adapt for Steampunk outfits. I would have given it five stars if it had the dress on the cover included in the content.
B00915G6YE|5.0|My favorite season yet.  Addictive.  Look forward to Michael Hall's next project.<br /><br />Why does Amazon need a minimum number of words for a review?  Dumb rule.  Concise is better!  We're all busy out here!
B007STBUIW|5.0|I have watched this movie every year almost, since it came out.  I hope they remaster it soon.  I thought it looked a little faded in some scenes.
B00CMQX84A|3.0|Me and my daughter loved the catchy songs and unexpected flash mobs, but the plot wasn't very good or satisfying. They've made a lot of \\"funny\\" adjustments to West Side Story, like it's biker's Vs. surfers instead of the two gangs, and there fighting over a hangout called \\"Big Mama's\\", but the part about the evil scientist creating a weather machine was a little too much. Also, the main part of the original story is supposed to be about Maria and Tony falling in love but no one approves. But in this it's about Mack and Tanner, and Brady and Lela's relationship. Though Mack and Tanner are both surfers, Lela is a biker and Brady is a surfer, it seems that nobody cares about their difference. Actually, in the whole movie, no one even cares what side Mack and Brady are on! The bikers and surfers may talk bad about each other, but they are never trying to pull each other away from their rivals, except maybe a tiny bit in the very end. Also, the whole movie had no twist's or surprises, everything was very predictable. The only part I liked was  after Lela stopped singing \\"Falling For Ya\\" and the bikers and surfers just stood their, not knowing what to do. They should of made more of these dramatic scenes, but they seemed to have left the idea behind. Besides the unskilled plot, the acting was OK and the makeup and outfit's were colorful and creative. Though the plot wasn't amazing, there was a funny part at the end when the bikers and surfers travel to the real world. When a man asks if they are lost, he shows them his phone with a picture of Justin Beiber as his screen saver. The bikers and surfers react by screaming loudly and long. Me and my daughter laughed histerically at this scene because we both don't like Justin Beiber. Apparently Disney Channel has turned on him:) Evan though the movie wasn't that terrific, I would still watch the sequel, and it really seems like there will be one!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good game If you like war games then this will be a good game for you like this game very much
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I have read his books for young adults that many of my 6th graders enjoyed, and was interested in his fantasy for adults.  It was a good read, and an enjoyable escape.
B00571F26Y|5.0|For years I have suffered with blood sugar issues. According to all my blood work nothing was wrong with me. No doctor was able to explain why I was so hungry all the time. If I went without food for more than a few hours my blood sugar would drop; I would get shaky, break out in a sweat, couldn't think straight. It was awful. I have read a few different books and tried a few different approaches in my diet to fix my problem. Nothing worked until I read Wheat Belly. Simply removing wheat from my diet has made all the difference in the world!! My stomach is flatter, I no longer get bloated and uncomfortable after eating and I remain fuller longer. The author definitely explains in detail why consuming wheat is so detrimental to our health. This book is worth the read and will really open your eyes!
B0010TBPJU|5.0|This is just an amazing film, based on an amazing stage production. The film is more expansive than the stage show, which is presented entirely as a concert with story telling. I've seen both and love them.  Mitchell is incredible in this role.  Something he was born to do, surely.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good free play if you don't mind ads between games but there are ways you can bypass them and continue to the game.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My daughter recently became obsessed with Sophia the 1st and so we got this for her 3rd birthday. She watches it over and over and over again. Definately worth it and its cute that it gives all the backstory to the show!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|***Spoilers***<br />I enjoyed this movie. I jumped a few times and felt scared throughout the 2nd half of the film. If you like horror movies and don't mind B-movie production values, I think you may be pleasantly surprised. There were two aspects of this film that reminded me so much of two other things, a video game, and a book, that I was surprised to not see them mentioned in other reviews. The first is how the building reconfigures itself and how time moves at a different rate from the outside world. This reminded me very much of the Navidson Record from the book House of Leaves. The second observation is that the movie captures the essence of wandering hallways in the video game Silent Hill 2, much better than the Silent Hill movies did. If you view the sequel to this movie Grave Encounters 2, there is also a plot point that recalls a recurring element in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. Grave Encounters is currently free to stream for Prime members, so you have nothing to lose by giving it a chance.
0061766089|5.0|Could not be more pleased with this book. Tim Brown is a genius of modern design thinking. A must read.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I play it everyday and can't get enough of it.  I feel like I'm at one of Andrea Bocelli concert.  It's very relaxing to listen to.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Another Dexter Season in the books! What a great way to initiate the beginning of the end. You will love this intense season of Dexter.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys drama, suspense, and having their minds blown. Like totally blown. Boom.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Gotta love the minions and you HAVE to love the price! Fun game and cool animation. Thanks a lot for sharing it Gameloft.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It nice to have a game that has a little bit of a challenge without being so hard you give up.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a great series. Too bad they can't see fit to make more. Maybe this could be a Netflix or Amazon series?
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Saw this movie when it first came out and enjoyed it then. Wife had not seen it so we watched it together. She fell asleep but I still watched it again and had forgotten the ending. I like it again the second time I saw it. Clever and sneaky.
B008GIDZHS|4.0|This is a wonderful box set with pretty much everything any Superman fan could ever ask for.  My only complaint (and reason for only 4 stars) is the discs aren't marked Superman, Superman II & etc. (just have pictures) and the very small print on the discs is in Spanish.  Everything else is in English including the box, box art, movie menus and etc.
B009NQZVKG|1.0|First let me say that I have liked most of James Rollins prior books.<br />This one starts well but soon turns silly with a plot line that I will not reveal and could not buy into.<br />I am usually wiling to suspend rational thought to a degree for a good read, however, Rollins wanted to take me too far for too long.<br />Skip this one and get &#34;The English Girl&#34; by Daniel Silva instead.<br />It's a great read.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Awesome retro throw back movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. I may have watched it more than my 4 year old daughter. Funny, touching and meaningful.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|I only buy series of show I truly love....this set keeps the continuity of some of my favorite characters right where I can find them.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have been kicking around the idea of this series for a while, and it delivered just what I wanted from it: totally readable, enjoyable, suspenseful action and good guy/bad guy drama!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is a book I will read many more times over my lifetime. It was so complex and so delightfully simple all at the same time. I loved it and have been recommending it to all my friends. Great read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|To say that this book is\\" fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth\\", Is pure cow excrement. Many doubters and critics of Christianity have said the same type of comments over the centuries.<br /><br />The author's publicly stated credentials are questionable. His writing is creative as is one of his degrees in creative writing. His Assumptions are Muslim and anti-Christian.<br />The sales blurb above is a misleading to say the least. He may have done research but we all know that the author's pre-suppositions often shape both his selections of researched items and his findings. He brags about his credentials as a scholar, while not able to admit that his Muslim training and beliefs are anti- Jesus as the Son of God as Christians believe.<br /><br />Academically speaking his conclusions are not based on a full study of history but only on sources, which question the truth about Jesus, Life, Teachings, Death and Resurrection!<br />Muslims do not believe Jesus is Messiah or the Son of God and this shows through in this Academically Anti-Christian Book.<br /><br />This book is a waste of money. This is A Muslim and Not A Historically Christian View. It only represents the anti-Jesus as God's Son crowd.<br /> It is obvious that the author did not consult those historians who disagree with the Jesus is just a man crowd.  If you are given it read it to see the simple hatred of the Biblical Jesus in the world today, then use it to start a fire in your fireplace. That way you will get more value from it.<br /><br />It is clear that the perception of those who have responded in anger, hostility and rage toward my review have their own understanding of Jesus and the author of this book.<br /><br />I honor your right to that but I see no point in engaging in your hostile conversations. Attempting to belittle or demean someone is not a discussion of opinions but an attempt to silence those who disagree with you. It is also intellectually dishonest.silence those who disagree with you. It is also intellectually dishonest.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I stumbled across this book not knowing it was part of a series. I liked it so much I went ahead and bought the other books. Nicely done. A very improbable storyline but the author is so good it all sounds quite plausible. The most outrageous claims seem perfectly normal and expected by this guy. Well done.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|As engaging as the first JG book I read, The Fault in Our Stars. JG has such a great way of inventing his characters. You really can't help but care for them. The story is unique, and I really enjoyed the fact that it doesn't turn out to be a typical, &#34;Hollywoodian&#34; chick-flick love story.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A very strong and well written book that will leave the reader desiring to read the next in the series.  There are continuations of the story lines from book four as well, which makes it all the more interesting.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Very comfortable to wear in my ear, and would purchase this item again if I needed to do so.  I would recommend this product to someone looking for replacement ear pieces for their Voyager Plantronics.  The medium size is perfect.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I remembered when The Shield aired years ago, but never saw all of the episodes. I'm glad I can watch all 7 seasons of this great cop series on Amazon. Great series comparable to some of the greats on Showtime and HBO past and present.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I like this Angry Bird game called Star Wars!  It is fun and I love the music and the special effects!  This is fun!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|But I gave it a try anyway because of all the good reviews.  I really liked it.  Good story and I like how she even defends people that may actually be guilty.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the movie and the streaming quality was great! I would recommend using the instant streaming to watch this video.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is simply very addictive, very basic but the good enough to spand hours trying to climb. Just give it a try
B009RH9FR6|3.0|The features that was advertised wasn't as good as I expected after I had received my case. There was suppose to have been a way to fasten the Kindle to the case, but there wasn't any way to fasten it down so that it would not flip out when 'repositioning it. I had to put Velcro strips in myself to accomplish that. Also the Kindle does not always come on every time I open the case.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Makes you think while solving puzzles. Can make you crazy in some rooms. Kids and adults will enjoy this challenge.
0345529057|5.0|It is quite heavy, clean and smooth, the books were smaller than i expected than the hard covers and words are much more smaller. The chapters are by characters rather than numbers and its a really good romantic, drama, fantasy, action, inspirinh book based on the series of game of thrones on television.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|Excellent movie!<br /><br />I love the underlying theme that our wives and children desire nothing more from us men/dads than to be fought for and to be found worth fighting for.
140006922X|4.0|I don't recall a book reviewed on Amazon with so many reviews from people who have not read the book. One reviewer wondered why anyone would read a anyone would read a book written by someone who has a Masters in Writing. Really? I would ask why that person Bought a book without at least reading the dustjacket or the introduction.<br />Aslan holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in religions from Santa Clara University, a Master of Theological Studies degree from Harvard Divinity School, a Doctor of Philosophy in the sociology of religion from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Iowa's Writers' Workshop.<br />But as Fox News continually points out, he's a Muslim. In their world, right wingers can write about Liberals but, not the other way around. So Bob Woodward can only write about Republicans etc.<br />This is a fine thought provoking book about the most important person who ever walked the face of the earth and provides a fresh way of seeing him. Who doesn't want to know more about him and the world he lived in? In many ways it makes the bible come alive. But then again, most of the bible was written by Jews so, can it be trusted?
B003UESJFG|5.0|Shipped fast, fun movie, and I just enjoy cartoons!  :)<br /><br />The idea that being evil is a lonely job and has no purpose if there is no one to defend goodness helps Megamind to find his Caring side.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim got a lot of hype pre-release from the geeky/nerdy sci-fi RSS feeds I subscribe to.  I mostly ignored all of that hype until the release date grew near - nevertheless, I was really looking forward to seeing the movie.  I didn't have huge expectations for it, but it surprised me.  I really, really enjoyed it.  So much so that I bought the movie novelization, the Year Zero graphic novel and the \\"Art of\\" book the next day here on Amazon.  If you're a long-time sci-fi fan, you'll leave the movie wishing for more expounding upon the concepts presented, but will still be satisfied.  I'm hoping a lot that the foreign box office is good enough to warrant a Pacific Rim sequel or prequel because I WANT ONE!<br /><br />Once the Blu-ray/DVD combo releases, I'll update this review with my impressions of it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Some car chargers are sooooo slow. Not this one, I charge my Galaxy S4 or the wife's iphone 5 as fast or faster than the wall charger that came with the phone. Just ordered another one for the wife's car.
140006922X|3.0|I already posted in response to someone elses post, but will rewrite it here..since the interview link brought me here..<br /><br /> Your post: Jul 28, 2013 4:49:44 PM PDT<br />S. G. Weeks says:<br />Interesting, I came to amazon to read the reviews before buying the book. I am agnostic. But studied religion in college for 2 years and always made it a hobby to study comparative religions.<br /><br />I studied, not seeking but to understand where they all link up and how they are more alike not not. Kind of putting together a puzzle of the mind in how religion has taken form for humanity.<br /><br />SO, I read the reviews to decide if I want to buy the book as a self study and compare to other books on the subject.<br /><br />All I have read is passion on both sides of the isle. The believers and non believers. One side calling the other backwards or insane for their beliefs or non beliefs.<br /><br />I find it ironic. Since I have not read the book yet, I can honestly say, maybe I don't want to read anyones opinion on any religious subject. It is too SUBJECTIVE of a subject.<br /><br />In other words, even if I was an expert in airplane design, but never flew, I am not really an expert in flying, just in the design of an airplane.<br /><br />I do think a writer can add their \\"opinion\\" on a subject of historical reverence, but will also add their \\"take\\" on it. Either consciously or subconsciously. Its just the way it is.<br /><br />I know the writer is a scholar, but he can only write his opinion on Jesus, based on all other books or documents that have already been printed on the subject. So in that case, this book is just a compilation of items that have already been published somewhere, anything added is subjective opinion on his part.<br /><br />I say, leave these books to those who wish to read them, but always would tell one of my students, History books are written with angles and takes, as is fiction or non fiction. I would only read this book if I was required to, in order to do investigative reading.<br /><br />I think if you believe you believer, and if you have faith or following, it is unwavering, so of course people are arguing..<br /><br />and that is why....people sell books!$$<br /><br />Your post, in reply to an earlier post on Jul 28, 2013 4:50:56 PM PDT<br />S. G. Weeks says:<br />I do believe the show is set up as a \\"Debate\\" show..not an entrainment interview show, and drilling folks *back and forth, and not wavering is debating.

B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Okay, I started watching this show because it was about two guys, in a car, killing the kinds of monsters that made me unable to watch horror films. And it was good, and therapeutic, because at the end of each episode, the scary-scary things were DEAD.<br /><br />Then they brought a certain seraph into the cast and I was hook-line-and-sinkered. You might say my interest was raised from Perdition too.<br /><br />Season 4: angsty, angel-y goodness.<br />Season 5: just keeps getting better<br />Season 6: not sure where they're going with this, but still worth the ride<br />Season 7: remembering that the series is good for many more reasons than just angels and demons.<br /><br />And then I was stuck and had to buy Season 8.  So let's talk about that choice:<br /><br />Does Season 8 drag in places? Yes.<br />Does it have stupid crap in it? Yes.<br />Does it have moments that make me punch the air at the WIN involved? Absolutely.<br />Is it so meta in spots that it hurts? You bet.<br />Do I love the new additions to the cast? You bet your sweet bippy. Felicia Day FTW, among others.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? Because I got to the last episode and swore like a sailor. For the first time in 3 years, I have to find some way to keep following this show. THAT was worth $40.<br /><br />(Also, the chance to see Castiel go seriously archangel now and again? Well worth the price of admission.)<br /><br />Excuse me while I go obsessively re-watch this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game and at a great price.  But wow is it frustrating at times.  Makes you really think about where you want those pipes to go.
B000TBI40I|5.0|This is probably the best Beatles album with the exception of the White Album. Everything about it is amazing and came in like new condition. Definitely one to play over and over.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Since the last changes I would it as very, very poor.  I do not like the way it is portrayed on the on the screen.  Maybe I do not know how to use it and the common courtesy . Of how to use it now has not been explained to me.  The changes were a suprise to me. I thought it was good the way it was and I am definitely over 13.  I am in my sixties.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|From the chemistry of the actors, to writing, to directing, this show has it all. It's got strong male characters as well as strong female leads. Which is nice to see. Must watch!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have enjoyed all the Big Bang seasons.  This one was particularly good because it followed up on all the previous seasons.

140006922X|5.0|So unless you are narrow minded and watch Fox news you should read this book and then make a judgement. I found it thought provoking and well sussed out. I am not an \\"academic\\" by profession so I cannot claim to know how he is as a historian BUT like any good historical book I came away wanting to learn more. Also,I did not know he was Muslim til I saw all the fox news hoopla. Totally ridiculous to take issue with that.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|A very easy read however I thought the plot was a bit predictable, particularly near the end. A good holiday read.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|I've played this game online, so I was already familiar with it. It's fun and challenging, but I was disappointed to learn that the free version in the Amazon store has been hobbled, so you can't play anything but one basic level of the game. Still fun, but you have to pony up if you want to get the whole game.
B0042KA4VO|4.0|I think season 2 is the best season of TVD.  Doppleganger hijinks and supernatural goings on - Damon is not quite so annoying and has his only character growth of the series to date in season 2. The epic love story that is Stefan and Elena is tested but remains strong.

If you liked the book, the movie is a reasonably faithful performance of the story. Set in what appears to be a post-apocalyptic world, the depressing environment can bring you down a bit, but it's a story everyone needs to know, as it could be the story of our future.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I liked this book, it kept my interest. Would recommend reading this and &#34;Discovering Pride&#34;. Pretty Good story line also.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|George Clooney is great playing a very different part than he usually plays. It show how multi-talented he is. The rest of the cast is great too.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I chose this rating because the story line was great and kept me interested but it jumps from character to character and sometimes you do not know who the author is talking about until you are into the chapter a bit. Keeping all the characters straight was somewhat of a challenge too.
B00538MG6A|5.0|John Travolta is great. I can't believe they initially wanted Danny DeVito to play the part. John Travolta makes the movie.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|The movie was funny, entertaining and the visuals were great.  It is a joy to watch such a wholesome movie.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird it one of my favorite movies.<br />Gregory Peck and other cast members make this a great movie.
B0013ND30M|3.0|its ok but glitches a lot, otherwise its fine. the case is fine it just glitches pretty often but the glitches are small so they dont last long except in one spot :/
B009AJDET6|5.0|Since 4 of these releases were originally double LP sets I feel like I'm getting 14 LPs (CDs) for the price of TEN!  Now...a bit of a warning.  Not everything Chicago recorded was gold.  I'm not too crazy about &#34;Chocolate Bar&#34; but as far as the rest go I'm pretty jazzed and rocked! ALL I mean ALL the hits are here...and some trax that should have been!  These are Rhino remasters and the bonus trax are fun to listen to.  Might hurt the wallet a lil' bit to spend a coupla twenties for this box but tell you what...you WON'T regret it if you're a TRUE Chicago fan!  Plus I like the mini album sleeves...!  Highly recommended...!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has touched me in a way I never knew words could. Absolutely beautiful characters make you think of the world in a whole new way.
B003498SDA|5.0|Looks great in Blu-Ray!  Both Tom and Jamie were perfectly cast.  I've never seen Tom Cruise in a better role.  Glad I finally own this flick!
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|This is actually the third purchase of this item... my husband wore the other versions of this concert out.  Brought him lots of joy!
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|Great, GREAT collection!  I really enjoy these packages...5 outstanding Doobies CDs in mini covers and CHOCK FULL of great tunes for a GREAT price.  Sounds like they've all been remastered, too!  I can't complain about a single thing.  What are you waiting for?  BUY IT!
B004L79VUI|5.0|Brought lots of joy to an otherwise sad time in our lives.  Brought back memories of The Band Days.... Thanks
B00BKTFABE|2.0|The camera is facing the wrong way!<br />Who wants to take pictures of themselves<br />day in and day out. Bad Bad
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Last music my husband purchased prior to his death.  Brought joy to an otherwise sad time in our times.  Thanks Joe!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's okay it's not the best though it also lags a lot but it's kind of fun when you bored .
B000FBH3XQ|5.0|To properly perform Mozart complete string quartets (including the Divertimenti & celebrated Eine Kleine Nachtmusik) the string chamber ensemble daring to do it needs a special affinity with this kind of music. Besides technical skills and a refined musicality, a deep empathy is also required. It is exactly what Hagen Quartet exhibits in a very natural manner here. The 7-CD box set proves a robust craftsmanship designed to enchant the listener and get the very essence of this special music.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is truly a work of art. It is a classic for a reason, and definitely one that everyone should read at some point. Austen's writing is ingenious, and the sentence structure and vocabulary just make you want to sign with pleasure. Wonderful, wonderful read.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Enjoyed the album, vinyl quality was sick, as was the album. Would definitely recommend picking up this album, as it a good one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|catching fire is a very moving book. i loved the way everything was described and detailed. the arena part and end are very moving and interesting. i wish there was more in the end.
B000EJ9N6O|5.0|Dope album. a little upset blister in the sun was in French but its still a dope album. Glad I got it
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|We only watched 5 minutes of this video, the quality was really bad, we finally got it on iTunes, great quality
B00C4QVQV0|5.0|KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY? I DID NOT SEE A REVIEW UNDER 5 STARS,THAT'S HOW GREAT THIS SHOW IS.I MEAN,I DIDN'T LIKE THE SEASON FINALE,BUT THAT WAS ONE MISTAKE THEY EVER MADE.WHAT MORE CAN I SAY? IF U NEVER WATCHED IT,I 1ST RENTED SEASON 1 FROM THE LIBRARY AND THE SCENE WITH THE LIL GIRL DREW IN A NEW DISCIPLE;THO U DON'THAVE TO SEE EVERY SEASON/EPISODE TO DIG THE SHOW.I WILL END WITH THIS:I WATCHED SEASON 1,AND COULDN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2...I DIDN'T HAVE CABLE, AND I HAD NO MONEY.WHEN SEASON 2 CAME TO ,UM ,ANOTHER COMPANY, I WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE...AND AT THE END I WANTED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.THIS WENT ON FOR HOURS.THATS HOW AWESOME THE SHOW IS.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great ideas for teachers~Love all of the DIY crafts and projects.  Great recipes and low fat ideas too. Awesome site
B00845PT18|4.0|staring nicolis cage, i can see the movie again and again,larrynastelli, good movie foir whole family to see agaiun and again
1932100660|5.0|This book is the book to read to learn about health and learn about the factors in our diets that make it occur.  Dr. Campbell's well documented research leaves no room for those who might argue to the contrary regarding how we should treat our bodies.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This 2 disc set is great!  All of Michael Jackson's great hits.  I don't remember what I paid for it ($14.99?) but it was a great price for all of the hits on this album.
B004GYY714|5.0|A friend told me about this app. Now I can listen to anything I'm in the mood for, any time I please. I've found some stations that I listened to when I was a kid and discovered programs from around the world using the 'browse' feature. I've listened to football games from the home team's local stations. Easy to use. You can even search for broadcasts by language!
140006922X|5.0|Don't listen to the far-right sheeple. This book is an incredible read--learned, fascinating, and exquisitely written. I look forward to reading more of his work.
B00AYB1KHW|1.0|Maybe this is a cult classic?  I couldn't get into it.  Some good gore but couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|ADDICTIVE, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON.  GREAT ACTING, WRITING AND PRODUCTION.  My wife and I really enjoy the time spent in England.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun  and cute and very easy to play and realistic it is also get addictive and interesting
B00D5YNQMW|2.0|I am very surprised after the criticism of the last release, that the same formula was used again. The quality of sound, picture and performance are certainly 5 star. The set-list for me is fantastic. I can even deal with the interviews between songs although it is completely annoying. What is unforgivable is NOT PLAYING THE SONGS IN FULL! This artsy amateur hour of presenting this concert/documentary is a tried and true recipe for failure. Some songs are presented as snippets. Beginning chopped on Toys in the Attic, Hangman Jury gets the half treatment, and the ultimate kick in the groin...Train kept a Rollin partly played over the credits. It's 2013! Please, knock it off with this crap! The Blu-ray disc holds 50 Gig of info. Certainly more than enough to play full songs, considering how short the set-list is. Mccartney has done this with several releases and finally wised up with his latest. Producers need to take note that fans hate this nonsense. Give us all the music, uninterrupted, please!
B005TOW9JM|5.0|This is a great album, i really like it when an artist makes and album and most of their songs are good
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It's tough for some to imagine anyone of one faith writing about the figurehead of another, and it may be even tougher to imagine that writing is nothing more than scholarly research (far more research than most readers will fein to do in their lifetimes). What's more, it may be impossible for some to believe that a Muslim can read or write, much less think clearly enough to pen a book. The beauty of this all is that religion has nothing to do with it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is the second one I bought - lent the other to a friend, oh well.  But now that I can get this with Amazon cloud, that much better
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|There are not many books by Picoult that I don't enjoy.  She does so much reaearch on the main topics og her stories that I feel it is a learning experience to read them.
0345525558|4.0|I learned much about flowers and what they represent. I won't remember any of it, I enjoy the beauty of a flower for that alone...the beauty. As far as the story line, I enjoyed it . Much I did not find believable but it is, after all, a work of fiction. I would recommend it to some of my reader friends.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I find the story line to be very, very interesting.  Very good show. I look forward to viewing the remaining seasons.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the awesomest game ever invented and what makes it even better is the cute and adorable little minions. I am addicted to the game and well it is the best game ever. Everyone owning a device that can play minion rush should get it and then go see the movie Despicable Me 2.
B001EBYM62|5.0|Funny, great music, love tap dancing, enjoyable for all ages (we skip most of the big dance scene toward the end because it is more sensual)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the awesomest game ever invented and what makes it even better is the cute and adorable little minions. I am addicted to the game and well it is the best game ever. Everyone owning a device that can play minion rush should get it and then go see the movie Despicable Me 2.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love it I think it the best game ever. I would suggest itfor anybody who likes mystery games it is somehow and somewhat scary however I know suitable for younger children.I have not been able to stop playing this to see how this story finally ends it is great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Why does the Mockingjay on the cover not fit the description in the book? It says under the wings is white. And even Katniss in her dress is dark not white wing tips!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good times, but I am worried about the microtransanctions with the kids. It is a fun game.  I love the minions.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Had me laughing outloud ! A most entertaining tale from start to finish. About a life lived every minute without ever considering a finish.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was very interesting and easy to read.  I read it over a 2 day span in my spare time.  I had seen the movie first so I was able to visualize every page.  Was it exactly the same, no but kept close enough to the book?  I liked the book so much, I read the next 2 quickly and can't wait for the sequel to the movie in November.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a good game. It frustrates me though when I get to that one point on a level and just can't get beyond it without upgrading. lol
B0000BYM3K|5.0|As with my other reviews of iron maiden and bruce, this a decent CD and it blends really good with my eddie box set.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|The plot was interesting but the story jumped around too much, too many short actions with too many characters without a grasp of relations.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This is a smart witty show that is fast paced and very engaging.  Intelligently written and well cast.  Watch the first 2 episodes and you'll be hooked.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I liked the writing style of this book, very different from the male POV.  But, if men really think like that - then it is kind of a disgusting way to live your life. Truly, ALL they think about is sex all day, every day and with mostly any woman. That said, I was able to get into the story and skip over the graphic parts (and there are A LOT!). It wound up being a funny and sweet love story. I would recommend it, but only to those that are not offended by down and dirty sex from the male point of view.
1576875776|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of simply stunning photographs by a true Artist. She took these photographs for her own enjoyment, and never exhibited or sold them. She was a master of her craft which was not recognised until after her death.
B0051YKV4A|5.0|If you loved the bands of this period, you really should own this.  Hard guitar players really come into their own when they have to turn off the distortion and focus on the chord voicings.  You will really love this, whether you are new to the band, or were there in the day.
140006922X|5.0|Dr. Reza Aslan sets forth at once a fascinating, insightful, and impassioned study of the historical life of Jesus. In portraying Jesus as a man with all his lifelike faults and ambitions, Aslan brings us closer to understanding the individual who became known as Christ better than any scholarly investigation before. The focal thesis of this impressive biography is to put Jesus in the context of his time period and reveal him as a man of substantial zealotry. Aslan does a remarkable job at illustrating the historical atmosphere in which Jesus was born and raised, an era steeped in turmoil and excessive bloodshed. In examining Jesus apart from his celestial aura and focusing on him rooted in earthly affairs, what surfaces is a diverse and complicated individual of lofty ideals and rebellious yearnings. I particularly enjoyed the thorough discussion of Jesus's quest for his Kingdom of God as something he strove to achieve on earth, a sovereignty where the rich and powerful are ousted and the house of Israel arises. Even more inspirational is seeing Jesus as the Son of Man on earth, living on behalf of God, his brief life essentially an aspiration towards kingship in line with the Davidic order.<br /><br />Aslan's research and dedication to this project are unparalleled. His notes and sources attest to his unwavering devotion to the historicity of religion. He is a scholar of the highest rank. From a literary standpoint, the quality of his writing is impeccable. The grace and fluidity of his prose allows the work to be read with great accessibility. This book does not try or want to undermine faith. It is an attempt to provide a deeper admiration and appreciation of Jesus's life on earth. As someone who respects all belief systems striving for peace and tolerance, I do not find anything offensive or disparaging in Dr. Aslan's study of Jesus. To the contrary, his extensive research both enlightens and empowers me with new knowledge and a greater understanding of who Jesus actually was. In order to become closer to what we believe, we need to open our minds. Only when we are able to embrace all our doubts can we become true adherents of any faith. Dr. Aslan's book should be welcomed, not derided.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've been looking at devices that does just this for a few weeks. as soon as I heard about this device I ran to my nearest BB to get it.  I already have a SmartTV but I HATE it. Very slow and hard to navigate.  I just wanted a simple way to watch YouTube and some other random online videos.  This does this perfectly.  Seems like people are split between thinking the smartphone/table/computer is either a good or bad remote.  I think its EXACTLY what I want. I already have tons of smartphones and tablets in the house, I just need a 'dumb' device that would play the content on the TV. Perfect for what I want. If that is not what you want then this device may not be for you.<br /><br />On a side note, this can 'cast' your entire computer screen. There is a option for it. And you can also use this to watch any local video from a Chrome browser as well. So if you really want to watch a file that you have stored to your computer just put C:\ into your Chrome browser and cast it.<br /><br />Only thing missing for me is the cast button from a mobile browser. For $35 I'm buying 2 more!
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|This was a really good movie. I like Jake Gyllenhaal, very good actor but I did not like the girl playing oppisite him.
B006RA0E5I|4.0|But it works just fine.  Actually works better than any mouse I've ever had.  But needed a full size mouse.  This one is just right for my small children.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook was a surprise to me. I love Bradley Cooper but the girl in this movie was a real surprise, I really liked her.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so addicting I can't stop playing it I rate this a 5 although I wish that there were different minions and can play as gru
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Makes me happy.....but sad too....I love the singing and Lea and Corey////eight more words required and i have nothing else to say
B0088P2A7A|5.0|How stale is life if you can't breath in knowledge. Every day I discover new things. I have this app on my Windows Phone, lap top and desk top and it is the most used app of all.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I'm a firm believer that no matter the age relevance of a book the author should be able to suck you in. This is one of the only books I have ever put down and down believe I will ever pick up again.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|Book delivered as advertised. I learned some good new techniques to help learning. Having a big chunk of the book demonstrate the skills was extremely helpful. I learned some of the skills along with the author and found myself more interested in some subjects I hadn't previously been. Great book.
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|I'm not a huge western fan, but I'm expanding my repertoire. This is a great comedy, and the cast is excellent. Definitely worth watching.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have to say that am a a Scarlett's novel fan. I have all her books. I would suggest these to anyone who is a fan.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I read the book before I saw the movie, and I think the movie really did it justice. Meryl Streep is absolutely perfect for the role, and Anne Hathaway does a good job with the evolution of her character. And of course, there's Stanley Tucci, whom I adore. Most of the other reviews sum up the movie and characters pretty well, but I will throw my hat in to say, yes, it is definitely worth a watch (even my fiance said it wasn't too bad!)
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is a thorough history of one of the greatest bands of all time.  There is lots of footage through the years of concert performances and lots of behind the scenes stuff too.  Every member, past and present gets his say.
B0012PDVQ2|3.0|Having heard all the hype about Blade Runner, and being a huge sci fi fan myself, I was expecting more. I liked Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer in their roles, and their scene together at the end was good, but overall it was quite slowly paced and didn't hold my attention well. I had read the book before watching the movie (I try not to compare, because I feel books and movies should be judged in their own right), and it was much more interesting to me than the movie. I think the internal struggle of the characters and some of the things that got left out of the movie (which I understand, as it would have been awkward to fit it in smoothly without making the movie quite long), really contribute to the story, and I was sucked in right away. The movie's definitely worth a watch, but it's not a fast-paced action sci fi, and I definitely recommend reading the book (maybe after the movie? Not sure it matters, really).<br /><br />TL, DR: Good film, not what I was expecting based on what I'd heard. Read the book as well.
B003C1SPX8|5.0|many years ago I recorded this concert( a shortened version) onto VHS from a late night showing on TV and always loved it.  During moves I lost it.  I have periodically searched for it to be on DVD and finally it is.  The energy and performances are amazing.  I highly recommend to any Dire Straits fan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is way better than the first which is very hard to do. There is no way to top this game........<br /><br />Maybe only with a Temple Run 3 ????
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Where was I when this series began???  Can not understand why I'm just now getting into it.  Yes, I know there are many other older versions...just missed this one.  Really diggin' it so far :)  Happy watching.  Love using my imagination!
B000BGH22W|5.0|I wished we could have more of Patrick's Music but he only did 1 movie. Fabulous music throughout this movie, suiting each mood as it comes along.
B00003CXBK|5.0|one of my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movies, a great story about the values of life and death and to overcome great odds
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams 2nd movie only strengthens his foresight into perhaps how the music should progress throughout the Harry Potter franchise.
0439023513|5.0|This book shouldn't even need a review. If you love Hunger Games, you're going to read it anyway. Suzanne Collins is a phenomenal writer.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I felt John Williams is a master of his craft . What a way to start a movie series with such themes they stay all the way to the final movie 11 years later.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Fun for the entire family, and a total kick to see Astin and Brolin so young! A definite classic adventure.
B0043URV8M|5.0|The music for this movie is perfect in detail to the storyline. Alex's use of soft ballad harmonies are quite mesmerising and melodic.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|The show just got more and more contrived. I couldn't stomach how fake the end of this season was, I won't be watching it anymore.
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams's 3rd instalment of Harry Potter is just as great to listen too as the other 2 he produced.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I really enjoyed this show, its smart and funny.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good show.<br /><br />I hope to see more in the future.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|Top music for this move. Some great new themes but also nice to hear the original themes too used in different moods.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Game takes to long to load initially and then takes to long to load a new game after you die.
B00285K1KE|4.0|Big fan of the Ed Norton version but this one is decent.  Four stars is the compromise:  I give it three but my husband would go higher.  Just too many leaps of preposterosity for this monstrosity of a superhero--literally leaping 20 or 50 miles at once is more than even Superman can do in a single bound.  Never read any such ability in a Hulk comic.  Yet the movie takes the time to develop a story and its characters, a tendency sorely and grossly lacking in current action films, so set aside your expectations for a true-to-form Hulk comic story and you'll enjoy it twice as much if you're in good, cheerful company!
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I love it and it was as expected. I don't like surprises and that is all I ever ask for.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|Have not been able to have time to go through entire book. Someone I work with has done well on this plan. So far I like what I have read.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Rome is very diverse in its historical, drama, and action events that allow both my wife and I to watch it together. Most of the historical events in the show line up directly with how history has interpreted the rise and fall of Rome.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun to play. Very realistic and challenging. Did not win so kept me interested . Would recommend to a friend.
B004TI1WME|4.0|This is probably the best calculator out there. It is very user friendly. It comes in very handy at the grocery store.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I actually love this backpack, it hold's plenty of gear (I currently carry my d3100 and 3 telephoto lens, and a large assortment of other stuff). It fits great, I'm tall and the last backpack I tried was way too short and uncomfortable. The backpack itself seems to be rugged. The interior is easily configured and well padded.The only problems I had with the pack are #1- the buckles are cheap plastic and the one on the waist strap had to be replaced the first time I took it out . #2- The main compartment comes unzipped easily.I remedied this with a couple of rings and a clip. For the price, this was by far the best case I could find anywhere.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very well written! Love the entire trilogy. Best smut I have ever read! Thank you so very much. I will read again and again!!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I don't like this weather app. It didn't give me maps and it want me to see weather for Boston. Really I live in wisconsin
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Another great narrative by Gillian Flynn, she creates protagonists you can't help growing to love. This is another suspenseful, intriguing mystery with lots of unpredictable twists and turns...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Ive read all books from this author, and have never been disappointed.  I was sad when it ended and never wanted to put it down.  Always a good sign :)
B007SSF3O0|5.0|I like the movie and the book. Alway happy to see this one. Happy love story, and a story of friendship.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I'm giving the show 5 stars, and writing this review to kill space.  Please don't rate this review, as it is written to kill the wor requirement.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have this game on every device I own -so much fun.  Get it now you wont regret it.  Have fun!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am having a blast. It is all age &amp; ability levels. My nephew showed me how to play and we've running wild ever since.  This game is so great.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Love this movie! It's my favorite in the trilogy. It's a shame they will never be able to bring back the Joker the same way again.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story told by Abdullah and Pari's father st the beginning had me hooked immediately. It was great foreshadowing, and I could not put the book down. I like the way the Hosseini weaves every characters' story together. And that there is more to each person than one might initially think. The reason I gave this novel four stars instead of five is partially because it didn't wrap up the way I wanted it to, but I guess it's not a reality for all stories. And the second reason is that I don't feel like everything was thoroughly explained; specifically, what life was like for Abdullah and even their Baba. Personally, I feel that if we can explore in depth the life of Nabi and Mr. Wadhti then we could have learned a bit more about their life post - Pari. All in all, it was still a wonderful story and Hosseini does a great job taking us through it.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Audrey is an was the best in her days I thought, but anyway it's a good story, loved it, thanks.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I wish that I could've seen this in theaters.  I never saw the trailers for it, so I missed it...  If you are a Star Wars fan, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie!  It has all different types of elements to it and it is a great space ride!!!  :D
6300216543|5.0|Anything Pacino does is going to be outstanding!  He's one of the best actors and one of my favorites certainly.  At any rate, this film was awesome as it touched on his career and disillusionment on the NYC PD amongst the corruption in law enforcement.  I enjoyed it, perhaps just as much as Prince of the City.<br /><br />Thanks for the quick delivery service.  Bravo!  Bueno!
B00009L1UP|4.0|I have been a Queensryche fan since I first heard, &#34;Silent Lucidity&#34;.  Great sound!  They sound every bit as good in concert, too!  If you like this CD, take a step back and pick up, &#34;Operation Mind Crime&#34;.  It's great!  If you every have a chance to see them in concert, do it!  Their CD's are made like a rock opera.  They tell a distinct story that has meaning and substance.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Having the old Star Trek series on Laser disc and DVD, this Blu-ray set with all the enhanced additions along with the original format is fantastic!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|First off, let me say that Daniel Day Lewis was great and deserved the Oscar which is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. However, the rest of the movie was just meh. I was bored and the sound was so soft, I couldn't hear the dialogue very well and kept increasing the volume and then the next scene was loud and had to keep turning it down. But besides the AV issues, the film focused on the amendment to abolish slavery. It was interesting how they convinced other congressmen to vote their way but mostly it was just boring. I'm sure this was an exciting time with a worthy cause, but some scenes droned on and on. At one point I left the room to take a 5 minute phone call and was going to rewind what I missed but didn't because it wouldn't have mattered. The film was overly politically correct which makes me think it was inaccurate for the time and the death scene was so quick. We all know he was shot in a theater but it would have been better if we had seen his final moments and what he may have been thinking but you just hear of his death, you don't witness it and the reaction after is short. I was expecting more as this was a major event in history. Disappointed and wish I had that 2 hours of my life back.
