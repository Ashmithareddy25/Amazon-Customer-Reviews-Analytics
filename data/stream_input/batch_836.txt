0143038583|5.0|I heard first about this book while viewing  CSpan 2 several months ago.  Read this book and then his follow-up [[ASIN:1594201455 In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto]]Both books were eye-openers as to what we should and don't know about the omnivore's true dilemma.  I'm still puzzled about \\"organic\\" but did learn to look for real food rather than all those nonfood substitutes so prevalent in our grocery stores. I'm also convinced I'll spend more to get better tasting real food from now on.  I like those eggs that stand up and taste so good.  Also, I'm reading labels and avoiding products with more than five ingredients where I can find them.     The book was suggested for my local book club and we were to review it today, December l6, 2008.  The Club was cancelled due to inclement weather; however, several of the Club members said we really had to discuss it.  It is now scheduled for January, 2009.  Oh yes, the author was on Bill Moyers program last week.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I am, like many who look forward to another chapter in the Harry Potter adventures. I believe we all hope to see an accurate presentation of what we enjoyed so much in the book. Understanding we can't have a 6 hour movie, there will be some \\"cutting\\" involved. The author has done a superb job of character developement and created a very detailed world, and then, tells a story that enthralls me.<br />  She has done so in each book. No director, or writer should alter this ladies passionate excellence. Let the story be the story and tell it true to the book. I saw the books come alive in the J.R.R Tolkin series in a well presented true to the books film series that thrilled millions. Keep your fingers crossed. I already have my DVD ordered, and expect to be at the Movies 12/17!
0684857219|5.0|Long before he was \\"The Govenator\\", Arnold Schwartzenegger, was one of the worlds most famous bodybuilders. I am not a bodybuilder myself, nor do I plan to be, but this book helps me to get more out of my gym time. At about 5 pounds and 800 pages this encyclopedia covers the entire topic of bodybuilding. From nutrition and diet to flexing, stretching, lifting and on. You won't be disappointed with this volume, and hey if you don't have time to make it to the gym you can use it for a dumbbell instead.

Have purchased many of other artists Christmas CD's and  am always disappointed. This is just a great CD and the background  music is fantastic.  There is also a duet with his daughter Antonia  who is featured with her Father in his concert appearances. A must have!
B0014JF1MS|1.0|I saw the review posted here about the albums being edited.  A comment gave a new link for an unedited version but that one was edited as well.  Guess I'm out some money.    Don't download, buy the real CD.  Amazon is lying to you.

0143036556|5.0|This comprehensive look at humanity's impact on our environments (past and present) is a critical read for everyone alive today. I found it so important that I bought five copies and sent them to family and friends.    The first chapter is pretty slow--though I've been contradicted on this--but from there on the book really takes off, so stick with it. Lovers of history will thoroughly enjoy the sections on past societies, and anyone concerned with or curious about the global environmental challenges we face today will find everything extremely relevant. The picture Diamond paints is fairly grim, but he concludes with an optimistic look forward and advice on how we might proceed.    Please read this book. You will not regret it.

1881273156|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who feels like they are in love with another.  Having gone through a divorce I can see where my former spouse and I were definitely hearing and speaking two different love languages.  The woman I am now in love with and I have read this book together, we've discussed virtually every page and both realize how important it is that we know, understand, and \\"hear\\" the love language of each other.  Luckily for us, when we answered the questions at the end we found that we are within a single point of speaking the same languages...our secondary languages are the same and even our third language is the same.  This is definitely a book that anyone involved in a relationship, whether a good one or a bad one, needs to read.  I've recommended it to all my married friends...who knows, it may save their marriage.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|To me, \\"Star Wars Episode IV\\" is Star Wars. I saw the origional release at a Drive In when I was 13 years old and have rewatched the movie (in it's various releases) no less than 30 times since. We have actually worn out a VHS copy of Star Wars because my kids also watched it over and over.<br /><br />Star Wars was really the first of it's kind. The special effects and production quality were cutting edge. The script was strong and the acting was mostly great.<br /><br />Get this set, enjoy both versions, share it with you friends and family!<br /><br />Recommended!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica \\"Death Magnetic\\", finally the band realized it's roots & went back to the basics of heavy metal. This album should have been the the follow up to the Black Album. Every song on this CD rocks, great rhythm & lead guitars and of course all of Lar's thunderous drums. I have had this CD in my car for almost 3 weeks & I just can't stop listening to it. I have been a fan of Metallica since the mid 1980's, and I applaud the boys for finally showing their head banging roots !!

B001FBIPF0|4.0|Fall Out Boy's fourth studio album 'Folie A Deux' is decent. After the great effort and success on 'Infinity on High', I as a fan of this group had high hopes for 'Folie A Deux'. On many levels, it delivers. It's more rock and alternative orientated than the last album which was very commercial and had hints of pop. A problem I have with 'Folie A Deux' is that it lacks the same excitement and drive as the previous efforts. It sounds too by-the-book for them on many songs with instrument backings that nearly drown-out the vocals, Patrick Stump often times scream/yelling the lyrics ... with this being the third outting, it sounds somewhat tired and tried by this point. With so much hip-hop and bad tween music on the airwaves these days, Fall Out Boy and 'Folie A Deux' definitely stand out as good alternative, somewhat rock and a little pop-ish, and the lyrics are somewhat engaging.<br /><br />Nothing really ground-breaking from the group that gave the world 'This Ain't A Scene ...', 'Dance, Dance', and 'Grand Theft Autumn' appears on the release outside of the first single \\"I Don't Care\\". There were a few, such as \\"America's Suitehearts\\", \\"The (Shipped) Gold Standard\\" and \\"Tiffany Blews\\", that stood out because they manage to not only have strong lyrics but good instrument backings. Many of the songs, when listened in one setting, fail to stand out from one another and sound very similar. I would have welcomed more variety, as the group had with 'Infinity on High', on this release.<br /><br />In all, an average release from the group that could have been better. Lacks in variety and the instruments at times drown out the vocals. Good, but not the best from this group.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Every song on this album is great! A must-have album, get it you won't be disappointed!
1595141715|1.0|I felt I had to write a review for this book because it was so bad!  Having teens and having been there myself, it was disconcerting reading when they were discussing the warning signs of suicide - changing your looks - that's teens without the depression!    Moving back and forth between what Hannah was saying on the tapes and the everyday things that were happening with the boy was annoying...Jay could have omitted the later altogether and it would have been more engaging. Then Hannah's character was so wishy-washy and inconsistent - it was too hard to swallow i.e. her caring about putting the stop sign back up and getting mad at her friend for doing what she did, then not caring that a total jerk was putting the moves on her. She whined the entire book! I wanted to smack her and tell her to snap out of it and tell these jerks where to go. It WAS NOT a book I would ever recommend to a teenager or anyone else. Get out the violin. Give me a break.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I fell in love with this series while it was airing for the first time on HBO.  Having read the books I think this is one of those rare times where the series is just as good as the book.  Charlaine Harris does a wonderful job creating the world of Sookie Stackhouse and her magical friends.  I love the direction that Alan Ball took the series, making it his own without losing the foundation that Charlaine Harris created.  Awesome series, I have watched it over and over and cannot wait until season 2 comes out in July.  One of my all time favorite series.

0545128285|5.0|Being a huge Harry Potter fan, I rushed out to buy this addition to the mythos.  While it was a very quick read, the stories were quite enjoyable and fit right in to the Hogwart's World.  The stories remind me of Aesop's Fables, Mother Goose and Brother's Grimm with a magical twist.  The notes at the end of each story by Dumbledore (translated by Hermione Granger) add another dimension for the adults to enjoy.    If you liked this book, I seriously recommend the books The Gingerbread Kingdom (1 and 2).  If you're an adult who loves living in fantasy worlds, this is a new destination for you to check out.

1400063515|3.0|Taleb's main point is that the bell curve doesn't apply to financial predictions.  That the industry of risk managers assumes that it does, means that the perception of risk becomes self-referencing, and ignores the possibility of a black swan event.  I give credit to Taleb for predicting the demise of Fannie Mae, and to some degree the black swan of the current economic meltdown.      Taleb reminds us all to look beyond the normal and suspend our assumptions and judgments because of the fresh eyes this can offer.     [...]    As a practioner of structured creativity, The Black Swan tenets reinforce this thinking, which can be very powerful and liberating in business and in life.  Taleb's main ideas are a beautiful outlier.  For some more concrete strategic thinking on how to create or just get in the way of black and 'little grey' swans check [[ASIN:1591396190 Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant]] and [[ASIN:0060521996 The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business (Collins Business Essentials)]]    Unfortunately, Taleb's writing is also often an outlier.  The structure of the book was lost on me.  Some of Taleb's descriptions, when introducing a new topic, were efficient and entirely clear and concise.  That is not the norm in this book.  It was an intellectual challenge and a struggle to stay engaged.  I wish, as other reviewers have suggested, that I had read Fooled by Ramdomness first, as it sounds like Taleb did the work needed to write a short book in that endeavor, and not a rambling, random work from mediocristan.  (Taleb's word for the world of bell curve reliance.)    I imagine that Taleb is a tough man to direct, but an editor with a red pen would have been very useful to The Black Swan. The footnote predicting Fannie Mae's demise, refers to 'Fanny' Mae.  Although we knew what he meant, the fact that this was mis-spelled is a symptom of what's wrong with this book; the editing, right in the middle of what was dead right; the prediction.    Read it, but feel free to skim.

B000F1IQN2|2.0|How could people be so cruel? How can people commit acts of terror? Are they just not like us, which is to say morally inferior? Study of history is crucial to understanding these questions. Ever hear about what happened at Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948? Or at Kafar Qasem on October 29, 1956. How much do we know about the founding of the Israeli state and what that meant for those non-Jews living in what was then the country of Palestine?<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is incapable of making a truly bad movie. He's one of<br />America's most entertaining and talented popular directors. Maybe the most popular. Spielberg movies are good Hollywood stuff. So, I very much enjoyed MUNICH as a suspenseful political/espionage action thriller. But truly useful in understanding history? Nah. Enjoy it as a well crafted Spielberg movie.<br /><br />If your an American you either A) passionately feel this film is unfair or even biased against Israel, or B) that it offers a challenging exploration of moral complexity and so on. You know shows \\"both sides\\". My sympathies much more with the latter, however I disagree with both. My guess would be that really only in America could there be such perceptions.<br /><br />The first part of the film portrays the events which took place in Munich during the 1972 Olympic Games. It is an amazing bit of filmmaking, making you witness to the tragedy. The second part of the film portrays the Israel response and it is largely fictious as director of the film Spielberg says so himself but some of the killings were depicted accurately.<br /><br />We get to know the head Jewish assassin, \\"Avner\\", played by the likable, intelligent and handsome Eric Bana. We meet his beautiful and see them together. We meet his mother who is quite an interesting character, but I'll not get into why...(I suspect Spielberg may have been saying something with this character, but who knows). We see the tragic terrorist attack in Munich and rightly are disturbed by this. We watch the top officials of the Israeli government decide on the proper response and we meet Golda Meir who is sort of Big Grandma of Israel.  Anway, it is clear that Israel must assassinate the terorists. No point in capturing any? Guess not.It is historically true is the Israeli government did murder those suspected have involvement along with some that may not have been and of course innocent civilians that were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the mission was called \\"Operation Wrath of God\\" and so what does international law matter.<br /><br />Spielberg said he did not want to do a Charles Bronson DEATH WISH revenge flick. So, we see conflcit in our hero Avner and we do meet a terrorist A-Rab. The Palestinian is allowed to speak of the Olive Trees and land of his people before being blown away. MUNICH does NOT show, doesn't dare show and nor does any character speak of what motivated the terrorist Muslims. In MUNICH we can admit they are human and it seems to be admited there is such a thing as a Palestinian -and for this along an adminition that things in the real world aren't always black and white Spielberg incured the wrath of, if not of God Himself, at least his spokespersons on Earth in the form of certain groups and individuals I'll not bother mentioning because quite frankly they're best left ignored as much as possible. If your American you'd do well to read what you can from the Israeli press which on the whole covers the business of that country much, much better and has a wider variety of view points than anything you can get from the mainstream media in the US.li government decide on the proper response and we meet Golda Meir who is sort of Big Grandma of Israel.

0375826726|3.0|Any book I read aloud to my kids ends up being a book that I look at more favorably than I normally would, but I have to admit, after having finished Brisingr, I couldn't help feeling a little cheated. I know Paolini split the final book in his \\"trilogy\\" into two books because there was just too much material for one book, but what I've discovered is that as Mr. Paolini matures, he becomes more long-winded and less able to just tell a story. That's too bad, because I have a feeling there's a story to be told, but it seems almost as if the entire thing could be told in a single (admittedly quite long) book.<br /><br />Descriptive passages are overcooked, extraneous detail is stuffed into the minds of characters, and the author is trying to create too much of a world and not enough of a story, and frankly the world was created in the first book. We get it. Move on.<br /><br />A somewhat enjoyable read despite my complaints, but if I hadn't been reading it to my son, I would have put it aside after a hundred pages or so and said \\"good grief, get me the cliff notes.\\"

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Can Clint Eastwood go wrong? After striking gold a few months ago with the brilliant \\"Changeling,\\" he releases \\"Gran Torino,\\" another one of the year's best films. What a masterful storyteller Eastwood is, so focused on creating that perfect balance between story and character. He doesn't disappoint with \\"Gran Torino,\\" a nearly flawless film that gives us characters we believe in and a story so compelling that it's virtually impossible to not be absorbed by it. What we have here is a cross-generational, cross-cultural story about people who can learn so much from each other despite being different. It's about regret, sadness, redemption, and growth, which isn't to say that it's conventional or archetypal; Eastwood plays a contemporary version of a Wise Old Man, someone who draws on life experience to teach an undeveloped youth. What's unique is that, regardless of what life has taught him, this Wise Old Man still has a lot to learn.    He has a name, of course: retired Ford factory worker Walt Kowalski. As a veteran of the Korean War, Kowalski has seen and done a lot of things he wishes he hadn't. He's bitter, antisocial, and politically incorrect. After his wife's funeral, we discover that he doesn't get along too well with his sons, specifically Mitch (Brian Haley) and his wife, Karen (Geraldine Hughes), who seem to believe that his age automatically makes him codependent and eligible for a spot in a retirement home. His grandchildren don't appreciate him one bit; the granddaughter only wants his stuff, hand-me-downs to take with her to school. They don't make things easy for him, but then again, he doesn't make things easy for them, either. It's a vicious cycle of resentment and miscommunication.    As this is being established, we're introduced to a teenage boy named Thao (Bee Vang), who lives next door to Kowalski with his large Hmong family. He's the black sheep of his deeply traditional family, always doing chores that the women are supposed to do. Having nodirection in life, he's pressured by his cousin, nicknamed Spider (Doua Moua), to join his neighborhood gang. As an act of initiation, Thao must sneak into Kowalski's garage and steal his most prized possession: A 1972 Gran Torino. The attempt backfires. Some time later, Spider arrives with his posse and tries to abduct Thao. The resulting scuffle is broken up when Kowalski points his shotgun at the gang members and demand they get off his lawn.    Within no time at all, Kowalski's front steps are covered with tokens of appreciation from Thao's family, none of which go appreciated. But then Kowalski gets to know Thao's sister, Sue (Ahney Her), a remarkably independent young woman. Quick-witted and outgoing, she takes Kowalski's racial slurs in stride, believing that a good man lies behind the disgruntled façade. As he spends more time with Sue and her family, he begins to realize that he has more in common with them that with his own family, which, in all likelihood, scares him more than it brings him comfort.    When Thao formally apologizes for trying to steal Kowalski's Gran Torino, Kowalski puts him to work doing various chores, like repainting a house and fixing gutters. Hardly a scene goes by when he isn't verbally berating Thao, although it's obvious from the start that he's doing it to toughen him up, to make him believe that his life has a purpose and that he should actively be trying to find it. Part of this involves getting Thao to talk like a man. There's a priceless scene in which Kowalski brings Thao to a barber, who has been sharing insults with Kowalski for a number of years. Afterwards, Kowalski arranges for Thao to work at a construction site; the boss, as it turns out, is the perfect man for Thao to test his new vocabulary on. What Kowalski doesn't realize is that he's learning just as much from Thao, especially in matters of caring for other people. Eventually, Kowalski comes to the conclusion that Thao and his family will never be at peace so long as Spider and his gang are around.    The film's most fascinating character is Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), a twenty-seven year old priest who promised Kowalski's wife that he'd look after him upon her death and get him to confess. Initially, Kowalski wants nothing to do with Janovich, who gives sermons on matters of life and death yet has no real idea what it means to face your own mortality. Kowalski knows--he served his country in Korea. \\"What do you know about life?\\" Janovich calmly asks. \\"Well,\\" says Kowalski, \\"I survived the war. I got married and had a family.\\" There's absolutely no joy in his voice when he says this. Gradually, he begins to appreciate Janovich; he many not have all the answers, but at least he's willing to listen.    The brilliance of this movie comes not from the development of the characters, but from the way the characters interact with one another. Virtually no one is on friendly terms at the start, but by the end, there's an understated feeling that respect has been earned on all sides. Kowalski refers to Thao as his friend only once, and while it was nice to actually hear it, it still didn't come as a surprise given everything that had been leading to that moment. At a certain point, you just knew how Kowalski felt. \\"Gran Torino\\" is such a wonderful film, so carefully structured, so perfectly cast, so rewarding for the audience. To make just one great film in a year is the mark of real talent. But to make two great films in the same year, now that's the work of genius.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Imagine that Jim Henson dies making this movie,(see [[ASIN:B00000K509 The World of Jim Henson]], [[ASIN:0679412034 Jim Henson: The Works - The Art, the Magic, the Imagination]]) in large part due to working with serious pretty badly fast moving infection and apparently a concentration and dedication that just wanted the show made right over really realizing he was so ill....and we get a delightful, darling musical with wit and courage that sells to kids that \\"something more\\" a Grinch also learned of the \\"real reasons\\" of Christmas. As celebratory of the coming lesson that love tempers living so that a life has meaning both in the good your love does and the good done for you in loving communication in community.<br />Clear. There is the possibility of redemption. (But you need to act on it for you are the key.)<br />And thus you have the start of a Dickens type tale; we lose a puppetering man through his love of both his art and what it can bring us. A kind of delicate tragedy if you think too hard. We could use him in entertainment, to comment to us as a group of these tragic times of rich and unseen poor or really scrapping hated poor. We own this DVD and the old VHS in my house, and did read these reviews here thoughtfully and interested on the screen size issues that are annoying, the deleted song and the specs. Very true issues that abounded after his death-access to Henson great's not always so easy. ( Lots of work to get Big Bird in China and Big Bird in Japan alone true classics[[ASIN:B000XJJIBU Sesame Street - Big Bird In Japan / Big Bird in China (2 Pack)]] or the signing pieces [[ASIN:0394875168 Sesame Street Sign Language ABC with Linda Bove (Pictureback(R))]])<br /><br />But we are glad as a family of true Henson fans to have this movie re-issue for use in teaching the tale of the miser that transformed his life by facing the ghosts of his past that held him, looking at the present of lost/losing opportunity,  and then bravely deferring to look into the cold grave of the future. To try to write a better page in the book of living. It's a really awesome story. Ageless. Great fun.<br /><br />I've staged this Dickens tale with children, taught it, used it to speak to values and to simply have an interesting experience with my kids. It led to lots of different kinds of fascinating dramas and insights over the years. Children at the age I teach understand little of banking, money and judging by conversations held in parent conferences understand very little older too. Isn't it amazing that after years of school many don't really get banking (or the way their giving to others works too or how to be more self reliant less product dependent) not much better than you see in this show. In fact you learn a lot that certainly applies today.... Well anyway you must know that as Scrooge, the dreamy Michael Caine, is perfect. The tunes curl around you and settle you in for some real ghostly truths to be revealed. My favorite part is when under the skirts of Christmas Present who is so big, brash, bold, jolly, you find Ignorance and her sisters Want, Need I think...it's such an effective image..of our blindnesses.(okay I liked Scrooge's song too when movie starts, a lot, well done) Dickens wrote to move people to different understandings to bring about social change in a highly divided and boundaried society. Henson  is  no slacker either in this undercurrant of societal potential for transformation once meme-ed into structures to be \\" more aware.\\"( His TV show of old the Muppet's often reminding me of the Smother's Brothers, a wake up call)<br /><br />Pick this up as a stocking stuffer or to give to a youngster and they'll have an experience where literature isn't drained of its sound and feel and turned to pablum or homogenized to dust and stuck in a basal as Mr. Scrooge Gets Three New Transparent Friends ( teaching \\"scr\\").

0670020745|5.0|For anyone who is interested in how the mind works regarding the processing of raw sensory data into the organized information that we call \\"consciousness\\" and \\"perception\\", or for anyone who has had a family member or friend with a stroke, this book provides great insight into what is happening.  Dr. Taylor describes the occurrence of her stroke and the immediate days and weeks that followed, written with the clarity and precision of a trained neuroanatomist.  Dr. Taylor suffered (temporary) loss of the functions of the dominant logical left brain, and discovered the capabilities of the (normally) subordinate right brain.  Later chapters describe some of her long-term learnings regarding trusting and relying on the capabilities of her right-brain.  The reader has to trust what she writes, something of a \\"leap of faith\\", but that really is to be expected when using the logical left-brain's tool of language to describe the contextual perceptual processing of the right brain.   The book is easy to pick up and start reading at any spot, and hard to put down.  Highly recommended.

The concert has a special guests including Sarah Brightman and Chris Botti, annd David Foster and is set in the one and only Tuscany. It was a plus have a CD also so it can be played elsewhere. Anyone who loves great songs and great singers must get this one.

1596912375|5.0|I listened to an unabridged audio version of this book, and I can't say for sure how much I loved it because of the excellent quality of the reading, and how much I loved it for the characters and story.  The mother-daughter storylines are somewhat imbalanced, but they have to be.  The mother's story is revealed to the daughter who has to make sense of it in the midst of her own, complicated, young adult life.  One character's narrative is completed (or is it?), while the other's is temporarily explored, midstream.  There is a satisfying conclusion for one storyline, and merely a stopping place for the other.  Somehow, these two add up to a compelling combination, like the mixed flavors of sweet and tart in a very good cherry pie.  Yum.

B001DTPZNY|1.0|I know that people get dumber with age after a certain point.  I forget to write or type words in the middle of a sentence even though I'm thinking about them and know they should be in there....that never used to happen.  I'd never have to proofread anything I wrote.<br /><br />The mistake George Lucas has made in the last two decades is that he has never bothered to proofread anything he's scribbled onto a piece of 8.5 X 11\\" paper, either...and why should he?  He can make anything he wants  and nobody's going to tell him how stupid he is or they'd be killed.<br /><br />I was thinking about forty minutes into this thing that I was too critical of this movie and I had to temper my anger or I'd suffer from health problems.  Then I thought about the initial thought of this tirade...maybe I'm just dumb beyond my years.  That's why I seem to hate everything associated with George Lucas since 'The Last Crusade'.<br /><br />I'd spend a lot of time trying to explain the storyline, but the bottom line is that it's NOT a Indiana Jones film.  I'm convinced George Lucas slipped something into Spielberg's drink just prior to telling him, \\"W,e finally have the story and script we've waited all of these years for, Stevie!\\"  Nobody in their right mind would have read it and thought it was a good idea.  Of course, Spielberg himself has made some real fecal piles in the last decade too, so maybe they're growing older and dumber together.<br /><br />When, after fifteen minutes, you're thinking just how much more convincing Bridgette Nielson is portraying a Russian than the great Cate Blanchett, something's definitely wrong.<br /><br />Ford walks like an ape throughout the entire film.  I know the guy's pushing 70 or something, but come on!!  I'm shocked Lucas didn't demand to make a computer composite of his head and just make Indiana Jones a computer generated archeologist.

Then Quato would pop out of John Hurt's stomach and call him a liar (and speaking of John Hurt....wow!!  What a performance.  Guy looks, talks and acts like he was pounding a gallon of moonshine throughout the shoot).<br /><br />This premise is more entertaining than what you get.  You're not sure exactly what's going on other than they're carrying around a glass head and trying to get it back into a chamber for the spacemen to reunite....and that's really all that needs to be said.<br /><br />They were due to swing and miss on one of these.  What's deplorable is that they missed so badly and it that THIS is what it took them 20 years to come up with.<br /><br />Just awful.ny Cox to bust into one of those taverns with a large weapon and implore there was nothing aliens buried in there that would melt the core of their strange world and create breathable air for everyone (including the mutants...and monkeys...and prairie dogs, etc., etc.).

B000006TZ8|5.0|The first completely indispensable Jam album - this demonstrates fully the wisdom of allowing strong, if highly-strung talents essential breathing space, and the result is one of the best albums of the seventies.<br />There's no padding here, 'All Mod Cons' in its entirety is simply, gloriously brilliant.<br /><br />It's got 'Tube Station' for a start. A colossal Jam song. The album version even better than the single with an isolated despondent Rickenbacker outro, instead of the jutting sharpness of the chart attacker.<br /><br />'Mr Clean', 'English Rose', 'In the Crowd', 'A-Bomb' it's an impressive list, matching easily anything coming out of the Clash at the time. 'Fly' is a ravishing piece of Weller lyrical romanticism; icy smooth but warming, deeply soulful and resonant. 'Fly' sums up 'AMC' in 3½ divine minutes.<br /><br />There's seriously meaty power songs trailing back to 'In The City', but here they have drive and direction. The extra time allowed enabling them to be honed into the marble-pure statements of anger and frustration which signify 'AMC' equally as much as the beautiful and the whimsical.<br /><br />Weller was untouchable at this time and there was talk of him quitting while he was ahead.<br />Luckily for the world he didn't.

At the time I picked it up, I figured it might be ok. I have read it at least 5 times and am getting ready to get a clean new copy. Some books like Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years and The War Years (Carl Sandburg) are fantastic books, but will quickly put you to sleep. The Ultimate History of Video Games is one of those fantastic books that will keep you awake and you will have a hard time putting down. And when you do put it down you will find yourself reaching for it often.
B000IN0ZLS|5.0|When my sister gave me this book and told me I had to read it, I was hesitant. I'm not one for most romance novels, but the art on the cover intrigued me. Once I began, I couldn't stop. Byatt seamlessly weaves two relationships set years apart into a delightful, inventive, breathtakingly written whole. The characters, especially the poets in the earlier story, seem so real, and so much of their world is meticulously created, down to some of the poets' actual poems, that I was almost convinced they really existed. This book worked for me on many levels: literary, romance, and mystery-solving. It's got my vote for one of the best novels of the 20th century.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll toss in a 5 star review along with everyone elses.  It's not a perfect show, but compared to everything else on TV - it's a 5.  The reason for that is the character development is done so well.  This is a show you can't help but end up caring about the people, their lives, their stories.  Once you get pulled in it makes the show that much better - and worth a second viewing.  Unfortunately, it takes a bit to get invested and because of that slow start, I think that caused the executives of FOX to be impatient and pull it before it had a chance.  It's sad really that shows today have to have instant pay out.  I'd suggest that is one of the contributing factors towards shallow, slappy, and superficial shows.  Don't settle for that, buy Firefly.

0930289234|5.0|This is the first graphic novel I have ever read.  I admit, I picked it up at Borders and I bought it b/c of the rave reviews on the back cover and b/c it had won an award.  However, as I started reading it, I became completely engrossed.  The characters are complex, dark and wonderfully fallible.  I love Rorschach!<br /><br />I have a few more pages and I cannot put it down.  I have read that this is a gateway book into the genre and I can testify to the truth of that.  I am already browsing to see what I want to read next.<br /><br />Another beautiful thing about the book is the illustration.  I particularly noted and appreciated the cinematography.  So creative and refreshing!

It is in SORE need of digital restoration from the negative, the colors are no where near what they were in the theater, but the quality is much better than VHS. If you are wanting a copy of this film, snatch one up where ever you can find it. Like most fans, I have been waiting a very long time for a copy of this, even though it is not perfect, it is a copy and still joyful to watch.    The fact that this is not a Criterion release complete with an outstanding array of special feature goodies is a total crime against the art of cinema.

1416595546|5.0|In 1916 St. Petersburg, a governess affectionately called Lala picks up Sashenka from the Smolny Institute for Noble Girls. As she completes her last class  before the winter break, Sewing for the Tsar and the Motherland, Russia itself is poised on the edge of a revolution that will overturn the old way of life and Sashenka's life for decades to come.  Spurred on by adolescent rebellion against the ways of the nobility's decadence (and indeed the lifestyle she sees within her own family) in a world mired in relentless poverty, Sashenka turns to her uncle Mendel.  Through his influence, an influence that awakens her heart for literature and idealism, Sashenka becomes a loyal convert to the Bolshevik cause.  For many years, Sashenka leads the life of the perfect revolutionary.  Married to a rising star within the Party, her dedication to the cause has brought her recognition as well as material comforts for her family, including her two children.  While her friends and family disappear, she herself feels safe from the political turmoil around her until she embarks on a love affair that will put everything and everyone around her at risk.  Decades later, a historian delves into Stalin's archives trying to track down the scattered family.  Hesitant to even accept the position, Katinka Vinsky finds herself drawn more and more intensely into a hunt to resurrect the missing pieces of Sashenka's life.  Katinka's discoveries lead to a tale of betrayal, strange alliances, and a great passion filled with courage in the most harrowing moments,  moments hidden within history that define Sashenka's life and that of her family.<br /><br />In SASHENKA, Russian historian Simon Montefiore tells the intimate story of the one  family through the history of the Russian Revolution and Stalin's Terror.  Historical figures such as Rasputin and Stalin intertwine in moments of the the lives of Shashenka and her family, but SASHENKA is a work of historical fiction that centers on the figure of the fictional Sashenka and the themes of family, passion and courage.  Although the reader feels the underlying depth of the author's historical research in the backdrop of the story, the author turns to historical fiction to pen a look at ordinary people, particularly women and children, caught up in this tragic time of Russian history.  The author himself intends to reach an audience of readers who may not read history books like scholars but rather readers who, through imagination and fiction, wish to explore the period through the ordinary people living in these times with courage and endurance as families.  In this aim, Simon Montefiore succeeds in crafting a story that draws the reader into the time period through the lens of family and love.  For those who leave the story anxious to learn more about this period, the author provides several references for exploration at the back of the book.<br /><br />Simon Montefiore captures the feel of the Russian epic novel tradition by focusing on particular moments in Russian history and Sashenka's life:  1916 St. Petersburg highlighting the pre-revolution and first stages of the 1917 Russian Revolution, 1939 Moscow with Stalin at the height of power, and 1994 with the historian's research through the opened Russian archives.  Simon Montefiore focuses on Sashenka as the young adolescent revolutionary idealist, Sashenka the established Bolshevik but also a mother and woman who loves passionately, and finally the archival records of Sashenka's life alongside the secrets and hints of family that allow the historian to uncover the Sashenka that lives behind the written record.  Together these three parts add up to create a story that provides a chilling tale of Stalin's Terror, the religio-military dedication of the Bolsheviks as well as the personalized idiosyncratic twists and intersections of personal actions with unintended consequences.  The effects of politics on the Russian family, as seen in the orphanage and in Sashenka's own family, are heartbreaking in the devastation caused to generations of families and for the immense courage within some of the families in their attempts to survive.  Simon Montefiore does an excellent job at making the reader feel the changes within Sashenka as she moves from being a teen who questions the world around her, to a dedicated unquestioning Bolshevik who puts politics above all, to a woman whose heart grows as she becomes a mother and lover.  The novel reaches a new height in the third and final part when the hunt to uncover Sashenka builds the intrigue and emotion.  The reader becomes more personally invested in the outcome of the search right alongside Katinka.  As the novel draws to an end with a intricate intersection of archival records and oral stories, SASHENKA demonstrates the power of historical fiction to make history both personal and alive in his portrayal of the intimate desires, thoughts and longings of fictional characters in this moment of Russian history.amily, are heartbreaking in the devastation caused to generations of families and for the immense courage within some of the families in their attempts to survive.

1594481717|5.0|In a very reader friendly, easy and entertaining writing style, Daniel Pink explains why the left-brained (or as he calls them \\"Left-Directed Thinkers\\") have ruled supreme in the last few decades.  The computer programmers, engineers, accountants and attorneys that many parents hoped we'd become.  But with the \\"Big 3\\" of Abundance, Asia & Automation, many of those jobs are moving to India, China and the like.    So if those jobs are on the decline, what does he think is on the rise?  (And in this economy, wouldn't we all love to know?!?)  Here's the good news for my fellow creative, artsy type...  US!  We are the right-directed thinkers that will shape the future like never before.  Here's a quote from the book:    \\"Left-brain-style thinking used to be the driver and right-brain-style thinking the passenger.  Now, R-Directed Thinking is suddenly grabbing the wheel, stepping o n the gas, and determining where we're going and how we'll get there.\\" (p.27 -- one of MANY dog-earred and underlined pages)    What he says MAKES SENSE.  And it excites me since I have a degree in Marketing but a business licensing my art -- working both sides of my gray matter.    But the key to success, I believe, is being able to use your WHOLE-MIND -- hence the main title of the book.  And as I turned the pages, folded corners, underlined passages and became giddy with ideas I had an epiphany... my time is now.      Artists looking for hope and excitement... read this book!    And to address some of the comments that say this book \\"isn't enough\\" as far as solutions... it is 244 pages everyone.  That can't contain the secret to the universe.  To me, this book is a book of understanding what is going on, exercises to prepare you for the future, and food for fodder to plan for your future.  GOOD STUFF and worth the money to buy and time to read.      That is my 2¢!      Tara Reed  TaraReedDesigns.com

Order it even if u don't like twilight, because the songs don't really have anything to do with Twilight except for the last one, Bella's lullaby, and that one is really pretty. It's just a song with no words. It's amazing. I love this CD!! I Love twilight!!! :D
B000002ORU|1.0|I ordered the Who's 30 Years Of Maximum R&B 4-cd set.  I received only one disc of the four, and it was damaged - looked like the surface of the disc had been dropped on sand.  It had pock-marks in the plastic and the information layer had been penetrated.  I wrote the seller requesting some resolution, never received a reply.  I will not do business there again.  Buyer BEWARE!!!
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|Everything you've heard about how bad the \\"standard definition\\" DVD looks is all too true. I rented DK before purchasing it, and couldn't believe how grainy and filled with artifacts it was!  This with an Oppo 983H upscaling player -- the best in the business.  Even at 16 feet away, I could see the horrible quality defects on my 46\\" Samsung LCD.    I firmly believe the studio released this DVD poorly mastered with the full intent of making the blu-ray version look far superior.  This hasn't been the case with countless other \\"standard\\" DVDs.  A sleazy marketing ploy.  Avoid this one like the plague!!
0385751532|5.0|This is a great book about childhood innocence and it's contrast to the adult world.  It portrays the need and joy in friendship.  It is a book I will keep forever.
073936474X|5.0|My son age 10 is enthralled with this series and couldn't wait to get this book. (This from a  child who hates to read and has dyslexia /ADHD himself.  The story is great , fast paced, true to modern day.  In my son's words \\"totally awesome\\"  I'd recommend this to any young reader - but especially boys.
B0008FXST2|5.0|Probably the greatest movie cast ever on one set (I know that's a VERY bold statement). It's a terrific movie and is great to watch over and over again. Definitely a necessary investment for your DVD collection.
6305428042|4.0|Perhaps no academy award worthy performances, but you can't beat it for good old entertainment value
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|As an Indian, I was cynical about this movie being as brilliant as the grapevine was insisting. I expected another Monsoon Wedding but got a punch to my gut as Slumdog and its outstanding music trasported me into the lives of Jamal, Salim and Latika.    For those who are saying it's a fantasy film -yes and no. As a young Jamal tells an Amercian couple while being slapped by their driver, 'You want to see the real India? This is it!'.     The sights, smells, noise, color, filth, frenetic pace and lethargic morals - it's all India, albeit through a Danny Boyle lens. A bit larger than life, a bit made up (police in India are not that bad), but nevertheless believable. Street urchins are frequently very smart and have a survival instinct a few notches above the average couch potato.     Most of you will have seen the movie or the trailer by now, and know the storyline, so I won't go into those details. For me, this movie was a winner because Jamal teaches us the meaning of life with a winsome smile. He is a victim, but wants to be a winner by finding the most important thing in the world -love. He doesn't know how to give up because that's never been an option with him. He lives, he loves, he rises above till the skies bend down to touch him.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I grew up on Indiana Jones, the characters, fighting evil (except for the second one that was lame), the melancholy endings are great. So when I heard my nearly 20 year wait for another Indiana Jones movie was over I was excited. What a disappointment when I finally saw it. Have Spielberg and Lucas even seen the first movie? I feel the only point to this movie was to try to revive Harrison Ford's dwindling career and they fell short of there goal. If you're a true Indy fan its best to pretend this movie was never made.
B001F7MSFW|4.0|I liked this movie much as people said they fell alsleep through it. As always HellBoy's humor pretty much stands out in this one as well as Abe and him singing while their drunk. Over all I give it four because the first one is still the best.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This is a great movie and I am happy to have the two disc to see all the extras.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I was surprised by how much i have liked this soundtrack. usually im not into this kind of music, but i find myself listening to it over and over again. most of the songs are very relaxing. and i love the rob pattinson song, i hope he puts out more music because his voice is amazing.
156224003X|5.0|I first read this book about 10 years ago on the recommendation of a friend of mine who like me is a professional jazz musician and music teacher.  He had been to Kenny Werner workshops and discovered the book that way. I've bought several copies of this book for friends and students who suffer from any number of issues relating to feeling that their playing isn't up to par. It's basically a book, based on a personal accounting of the author's own struggles with self confidence as a piano,a young adult player trying to find himself while riddled with self-doubt. It's mainly designed for more advanced students and players but is appropriate for anyone/student who has done some hard work and finds themselves unable to produce at a level that gives them satisfaction with where they are musically.  The basic premise of the book, in my opinion, is that improvisers need to let go of the need to impress their audience (even considering themselves an audience) and learn to be \\"in the moment\\" and experience their own music with open ears and open mind. It's simple powerful conceptually and the book includes a cd and meditations (which I've never done) that are supposed to help with that.  I strongly recommend this book.
B001FSDOZO|2.0|I like Nickelback a lot. Do I like it as much as dating models? Probably not, but it's pretty good. Chad Kroeger makes singing while sounding like you are pooping sound outstanding. I don't know how he does it, but he is blinding me with calculus. He is like a cross between Fred Durst and Scott Stapp which equals awesomeness. He has a mic flow that makes Burns sound like Kroll after some goldschlager. The thing about Nickelback is that they are very unpredictable. They really come out rockin on this thing. It's like some of their friends made fun of them for all of their songs sounding the same and they got ticked and said, \\"We're going to rock and you can't play with our Master of the Universe Toys!!\\". That is sticking the middle finger up at the man, which is what Nickelback does. I like it because I live on the edge sometimes. I'm not going to lie, I drove 62 in a 55 this morning and didn't even think about the risk of getting pulled over. Why would I do something like that? I do it because Nickelback has me fired up. Get this CD in the next seven days and something good will happen to your neighbors dog.    Average wanted a ride to the mall to go shopping and I gave him a bus ticket to my uncle's house.
B00008DDSC|4.0|The movie itself was very good. There are some very sexy and emotive scenes. Great acting on the part of James Spader--he makes the film, in my opinion. Maggie Gyllenhall is also very well cast in this role. My only qualm is that this film associates BDSM with mental illness and emotional issues, implying that kink is the result of these problems.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I love almond M & Ms which leads to the totally logical conclusion that I would love this piece of musical chocolate. I think we can all agree that Richard Marks put out most of the greatest music ever by a male solo artist, but this Jason Mraz cat is dropping some championship music that should easily get him past the sweet sixteen into the elite 8. His reggae groove on \\"I'm Yours\\" takes me back to the days where I ran the grill Chips Bucket of Food in downtown Syracuse. Times were laid back. I hear the song every five minutes so you'd think I would want to hit someone with a bat the next time I hear the song. Totally not true!! I want more. I like every other song on this better because I don't hear them every time I have to go to the bathroom. Mraz is a great singer songwriter and you can tell the Hasslehoff influence on his work. Each nugget on this thing is finely crafted like my chia pet. Look out because here I go! I'm getting excited just typing about this thing. It's as if I'm at the pet store and the girl comes up and asks if I want to take home the chinchilla. I say, \\"No way Coolay, I want pudding for six!!\\". I'm lighting up the opponent right now like Mraz lights up the cool songs chart.    Get this thing and average will leave you alone.
6305657947|4.0|The remake is surprisingly better than the original. After seeing the original again I'm struck by how self-indulgent the movie is. The action scenes are great, but everything else seems to drag. Hard to admit, being a big Steve McQueen fan.<br /><br />The remake is much smarter, upbeat and focused. I love Ms Russo, too - probably more than Dunaway.<br />All in all the remake is a better vehicle for actors. I give the remake 4 stars and the original 3.
B001GQACGE|1.0|I was so disappointed when I listed to some of the tracks on this cd. The cd was terrible! Has Beyonce turned into a country western singer? She must have rushed to make the cd, desperate for some material to sing over! This, by far is her worst album ever!!
B000DZIGDU|4.0|American Boredom: Every War is the Same<br /><br />There is a mantra within the EMS (Emergency Medical Services) community that the work is defined by extended periods of intense boredom interrupted by occasional moments of sheer terror. The same has been said, I believe, of war (and marriage too perhaps). This is the primary message that is being made within this finely crafted piece on modern warfare. That and what this sort of pattern does to a man's psyche. However there are many other specific points of consideration that are touched upon during the film within this larger contextual premise.<br /><br />One of the strengths of `Jarhead' is that is manages to maintain a healthy comedic tone throughout most of its entirety. The humor is, though at times perhaps crude, nonetheless true to life and consistent with the type that emerges from within the safety of the camaraderie found in such a setting.  To compare this film to Full Metal jacket is unfair. FMJ was iconic with its brutal depiction of basic training and the preparations for war. Attempts at humor were minimal when present at all. `Jarhead' is not only unique with its contrary approach but highly effective in making its points along the way.  Its gradual progression into a more serious piece of work correlates with the transition of the young men in the film into active war combatants.  It's logical artistically and it works.<br /><br />The acting is strong throughout, anchored by Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Fox, and talented more unknowns like Lucas Black and Chris Cooper in supporting roles. The points within the film, aside from the central aforementioned premise, relate to political motivations for war (like oil), suicide/mental health issues in combat veterans, friendly fire concerns, and the masturbatory practices of young men in isolation. It is at times tragic but the humor is what keeps it together and smooths the consumption of the more serious topics broached.<br /><br />Mendes exhibited his mastery previously with `American Beauty' and he does so again in a polar opposite setting. Do yourself and favor and check out `Jarhead'.  Amidst the regular clutter of banal mediocrity in modern film and the overpopulated collection of similar war movies, lies this treasure. A thinking man's piece if not a masterpiece.  And a fine one at that.<br /><br />-Rusty Scalpelan Beauty' and he does so again in a polar opposite setting.

0142000671|5.0|My 17 year old needed a book for an English report.  I wanted to introduce him to one of my all-time favorite authors, but at the same time not overwhelm him the volumn of \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", etc.  This is a kid who is going to be an engineer and doesn't \\"believe reading is all that important\\".  After all, it is not Science!    I, of course, re-read it still another time before handing it to him.  He was delighted at the sight of such a thin book (\\"I can read this in two nights\\"). He had to admit after reading it, that his teacher and I were correct in our assessment of Steinbeck.  His writings are timeless.
B00006AFF5|5.0|I was not happy that they were going to mess with my childhood favorite...but I begrudgingly saw it with my sisters the first Christmas it was out.  I loved it and it is now the Grinch that we watch each year as a family.  The DVD was shipped fast and without problem.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|This was the longest movie ever made, clocking in at over 7 ½ hours. Maggie Gyllenhal, a woman who has been able to construct a career despite being half Pekingese was killed off half way though but still, a very long movie. I'm sorry but Heath Ledger, a very hot man, should not have been subjected to all that face makeup. He could have and would have played the Joker much better with just his normal gorgeous face.   Because of the movie, I have cut off ties with Chris Nolan and we are no longer friends. I have deleted his name from my phone book and have ignored all his texts, even when he wanted to go to the Sanrio store in Tokyo and said I could have whatever I wanted. In my opinion, this movie is way too long and he did it on purpose. Jerk.

159562015X|1.0|What a horrible customer experience. I have still not received the book after almost 6 weeks. The company sending the book is not Amazon (a 3rd party company) and it is impossible to get a hold of the company for them to even tell me where the book is. There is no phone number to cal, only a generic email address that never gets responded to. I thought Amazon was all about the customer. What a dissapointment!
0345495004|4.0|Loving Frank was a book club selection.  I was raised in Wisconsin and have visited Spring Green, and reading about this area and Frank Lloyd Wright's personal life from Mamah's perspective was interesting to me.  Realizing that it is fiction, but historically correct, this book was a good read, and a great book club discussion novel.
B001LKLANE|1.0|Beware, this edition contains all sorts of unmappable punctuation, resulting in irritating replacement characters appearing in place of every apostrophe.
0385751893|5.0|The product was the right price as the initial reason for the purchase, but once we received the item it far exceeded our expectations of a used item at such a fantastic price.

Thanks Amazon.com for delivering quality in grand fashion.

B000H5U832|5.0|My grandson Loves this DVD.  It's his second copy....He wore out the first one.
0575077174|5.0|I love the way Reynolds can tell a story over the course of thousands of years and still have the same characters. The back story interspersed with the real time action, always kept me intrigued to where the story was going, of course I knew eventually they'd come together and explain the impact of the beginning on the latter part of the book. Couldn't put it down especially the last half. I've read all of his books, this is up there with the best. Love the new universe he's created. As far as I'm concerned there's no better scifi writer out there.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Fun rich visually stimulating sequel loaded with extras that provide in-depth thorough coverage on the behind-the-scenes process of movie-making.  Love the glimpses of conceptual art and the designs of the unique creatures that inhabit Del Toro's fantasy worlds.  I would also recommend getting the \\"Hellboy II: The Art of the Movie\\" book for those interested in creating conceptual art for movies within a budget.  [...]
B000H5U832|5.0|I was extremely happy with the quality of this particular purchase.  The DVD was a gift for my Godson.  Even though he is not even 2 years old, he knew the movie's name.  The DVD was flawless.  We were very pleased with the content and presentation.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|This is a great video series. It was very affordable and my husband loved it for his birthday present.
B00097DX3U|2.0|2 1/2    The kind of contrived radio friendly material which generates a multitude of mediocrity amidst a few earnest gems. Usually the whiff of disposable Rage-Soundgarden outtake aroma permeates the vibe, although a practical, accessible approach behind many of these often insignificant sections is certain.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Heard Adele on Saturday Night Live a couple of weeks ago.  Loved her voice and decided to get her CD, Adele 19.  Amazing that she is so young and yet so talented and accomplished.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|Shipping was great, items arrived earlier than I expected. Both my kids loved the \\"jack movie\\" and wall-e. Only one problem, that is all we watch now.
B000E0WJIC|4.0|The CD was pretty good, it have a nice intro and ending. After a while the scream-vocals get mellow but it is a pretty nice CD over all. They just need to have a little more variety.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This is definitely one of the more dark and twisted Batman films ever made. Health Ledger just blows the audience away. He is convincing in his role which makes up for the silly voice that is used when Christian Bale is \\"Batman\\". Of course Batman would have a slightly different voice than his alter ego Bruce Wayne but in this movie it was almost comical. That's the only gripe I have about this movie was that voice. Otherwise this is an amazing movie and it's worth sitting and watching for the 2 hours. I wish the special edition had more special features (maybe a behind-the-scenes interview) but the stuff on the sound effects and other special effects was entertaining. If you are a fan of the Dark Knight then it's worth buying the two-disc edition. Otherwise, the single disc is fine.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Such a great CD -- but buy the deluxe edition. This one isn't nearly enough of that great Coldplay-enhanced-by-Brian-Eno sound.
0810995212|5.0|The book is a surprise, probably believing could be one of those watershed biographies, this book reach all the aspects of his life, his siblings and his lover; and giving light about the artistic life surrounding JCL. No mention the Illustration are the thing you are drawn for having this book. Could be more pictures, but this is not a Summa pictorica of his work (It would be a enormous tome) ; But when publishing a book, you have to make  decisions. At the moment is the best book about this American Illustrator.

B001FBIPF0|5.0|If your already a fan of Fall Out Boy, especially the last 2 albums, then there's a good chance you'll really enjoy Folie A Deux. I didn't like Infinity On High until I heard it a few times, but FAD I liked from the first play through. I don't know that this will be an album that will convert the haters, because if you DIDN'T like the last two albums, FAD probably won't change your mind. The guitar parts are awesome, hard and distorted on songs like My Winona, Headfirst Slide Into Cooperstown, and w.a.m.s. (my top favorites). I didn't really like What A Catch Donnie, since it's the slow ballad of the album. If your already a fan, don't even question it, just get FAD and enjoy it.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This is the best CD purchase I have made!  It is great music and David did an awesome job with these songs!  Way to go !!!!!  I highly recommend it.
1594481717|1.0|Pink apparently was doing a right-brain exercise when he came up with the fantastical, unsupported central thesis of this book. He thinks that for some reason, all the analytical jobs with barriers to entry (education, hard work) are going to move overseas, but the creative, empathic-type jobs in this country won't (why? - he never says) and instead somehow artsy-fartsy (uneducated, lazy, but astoundingly creative) you is going to be so valued that you will be able to hire all the programming/accounting/lawyering and other white-collar skills from India with your spare change.    This book exists to tell you what you want to hear, regardless of how thinly-supported it is. I can't believe it got published.

B000I2JDEY|5.0|George and Martha invite Nick and Honey to their home after a faculty party- and the game begins. At first, it's fun to watch Burton and Taylor fight. You feel slightly uncomfortable that they do it in front of their guests but later it's apparent that fighting is their comfort zone. Fighting keeps them safe and from facing a very serious reality-a very grim, dark secret they both share. Nick and Honey are pawns in their psychological game. The dialogue is very sharp-hilarious at times, but also cruel and sad. All four characters \\"find themselves\\" during their night of binge drinking and outbursts of rage. If you want to see master actors and verbal sparring at it's best, this film should not be missed.
031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  Of course, I would recommend reading the first three before you read this.  The first two are definitely the best and the third is the worst--very hard to get into.  It's fun series to get whisked away and caught up in their story.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|This movie is charming for two reasons: Alda & Burstyn. Both are exceptional actors and I appreciate that we get to see the change in them throughout the course of their affair. The story is interesting and not in the least bit apologetic and it goes beyond the typical \\"will my wife/husband find out?\\" sort of dialogue. I find that I'm just appreciating these two people having arguments and debates and sharing bits about their families. This film is also interesting because it's basically a dialogue movie but it manages to keep our interest. Sometimes the dialogue or the action was a bit jarring, almost unnatural, you can tell it was borrowed from the play in which case it should've been toned down for the film. I really didn't appreciate the music, either-it was rather dated (and not in a good way). I know this movie is pegged as a \\"romantic comedy,\\" but it struck me as more of a serio-comedy than a romantic one. To me, romantic comedies are like \\"When Harry Met Sally.\\" Regardless of it's faults, it's worth watching for the fabulous acting.
B001F290E4|4.0|Released shortly after Mr B.Obama's victory the first title of Seal's last album gets a prophetic sounds and gives to the entire album a touch of grace, and a lot of soul.   No matter what Seal's does and how up-beat some of his songs are his voice delivers his soul both made of melancholy and hope and of the failure and strengh of mankind .   In this album he revisits famous songs and gives to most of them a very interesting twist of Seal .   Composed of treasure from our past This opus ends with \\"People get Ready\\" which invites us to look forward , to a better future . From slavery to freedom a change is coming ... people get ready .
B001EO2UKO|3.0|I've been waiting five years for this album to come up, so my expectations were pretty high. I wasn't completely disappointed, but I wasn't entirely satisfied, either. \\"Safe Trip Home\\" is a good album, but it's not exactly brilliant, and it's nowhere close to Dido's first and most fabulous effort, \\"No Angel.\\" The Dido we all know and love is very much present on this CD, which is filled with with her signature dreamy melodies and soothing voice. However, although the lyrics themselves are emotional, only a few of the tracks really grabbed me the way Dido's earlier hits like \\"Here With Me\\" and \\"Don't Think Of Me\\" did. For the most part, all these tracks sound the same and are, dare I say, I tad bit on the dull side. The three songs I like the most are \\"It Comes and It Goes,\\" \\"Look No Further,\\" and \\"Northern Skies.\\" Everything else is just okay. The album is also more depressing than Dido's other two CDs, most likely because her father passed away a couple of years ago and a number of the songs on \\"Safe Trip Home\\" are about dealing with grief and loss. Overall, this is a decent CD, but I wonder if Dido will ever be able to capture the magic of her first album. Maybe she should take the next 10 years to try and figure it out.
B000VEA30W|5.0|This album...I can't pick a favorite song cuz they are all good.  I must have listened to it everyday since I got it.  When you listen to it..eargasam!

The band seems really close and awesome, makes me wanna see them live even more.

0007240198|5.0|Ben Goldacre is a doctor who writes a weekly column in the Guardian exposing bad medicine. He writes, \\"The hole in our culture is gaping: evidence-based medicine, the ultimate applied science, contains some of the cleverest ideas from the past two centuries, it has saved millions of lives, but there has never once been a single exhibit on the subject in London's Science Museum.\\"<br /><br />He attacks the idea that social and political problems can be solved by pills, even Patrick Holford's Optimal Nutrition pills, or those of the TV 'nutritionist' Gillian McKeith, with her PhD from a non-accredited correspondence course 'college' in the USA. Their advice is just 'a manifesto of right-wing individualism', blaming people's ill-health on their food choices, not on the social inequality that drives health inequality.<br /><br />Dr Goldacre writes, \\"All too often this spurious privatisation of common sense is happening in areas where we could be taking control, doing it ourselves, feeling our own potency and our ability to make sensible decisions; instead we are fostering our dependence on expensive outside systems  and people.\\"<br /><br />He praises the brilliant Cochrane reviews of medical literature. He notes that to say that giving placebos in trials of treatments is unethical is to assume that the treatment is better, which is to assume what is being tested. We don't know the result of the trial before we do it - that is why we do trials.<br /><br />For example, trials have proven that the painkiller Vioxx caused 80,000-139,000 heart attacks, a third probably fatal, during its five years on the market. Trials have also discredited antioxidants, hormone replacement therapy and calcium supplements.<br /><br />Dr Goldacre notes that anti-arrhythmia drugs when given to all heart attack patients, not just to those with arrhythmic heartbeats, increased their risk of dying. He reminds us that Benjamin Spock's well-meant but wrong advice - that babies should sleep on their tummies - led to tens of thousands of cot deaths. What counts is the effect, not the intent.<br /><br />He recounts the media's disgraceful nine-year campaign against the Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine. The campaign caused an epidemic of mumps in Britain, with 5,000 cases in January 2005, and 2008 saw the highest number of measles cases since 1995.

061891868X|5.0|Theoretical physicist Lee Smolin notes, \\"One question that has bedeviled the [quantum] theory from the beginning is the question of the relationship between reality and the formalism\\", that is, between the real material world and our ideas about it. Smolin backs materialism against idealism writing, \\"It cannot be that reality depends on our existence.\\"<br /><br />He attacks the idea that it is 'as though the universe had been designed to accommodate us'. The universe has evolved in a way that has produced the conditions that make our lives possible. This does not mean that it was designed, still less that it was designed for us.<br /><br />Smolin tells the story of how the American physicist Freeman Dyson in 1947 read Einstein's efforts to construct a unified-field theory and decided that they were junk. Unfortunately he didn't have the nerve to tell Einstein this - but he should have done, because it might have helped Einstein to do better.<br /><br />Currently, string theory is the leading paradigm in physics. But its research programme has found no grounding in experimental results or mathematical formulation. As one of its pioneers, Daniel Friedan, later wrote, \\"String theory cannot give any definite explanations of existing knowledge of the real world and cannot make any definite predictions. The reliability of string theory cannot be evaluated, much less established. String theory has no credibility as a candidate theory of physics.\\" Smolin writes, \\"the existence of a population of other universes is a hypothesis that cannot be confirmed by direct observation; hence, it cannot be used in an explanatory fashion.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately, there are approaches other than string theory, new theoretical and experimental developments, like doubly special relativity, which claims that in the early universe the speed of light was faster.<br /><br />Smolin argues that there was continual progress in physics between 1780 and 1980, but none since. University physics departments have become dominated by conventional research programmes, threatening both academic freedom and progress. Original minds are dismissed as 'too intellectually independent'.<br /><br />He argues that physics needs a revolution questioning the basic assumptions of relativity, quantum theory and the foundations of space and time. He ends by urging young people never to let others do their thinking for them.ional research programmes, threatening both academic freedom and progress.

B001DTUU7A|5.0|On the island of Nool, in the jungles there lived an Elephant named Horton (Voiced by Jim Carrey) who had some friends like a mouse named Morton (Voiced by Seth Rogen). However the jungle is controlled by a snobby Kangaroo (Voiced by Carol Burnett) whom feels like a boss to our hero, but one day he discovers a speck on a clover that contains a world of people called Whos, the mayor of Whoville (Voiced by Steve Carrell) befriends Horton and the Elephant must try to protect it from the dangers of the Island where he must take the clover with the speck to a safe place where it won't be harmed.<br /><br />Utterly delightful, charming and hilarious adaptation of Dr. Seuss's beloved novel! this animated comedy is one of the best non-pixar CGI animated movies in recent memory. The animation from Blue Sky is absolutely superb and there's plenty of good in-jokes and laughs for adults and teens as well as kids, Jim Carrey perfected the title hero quite well. The film co-stars Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Jesse McCarthy, Jonah Hill and Dan Fogler also do some wonderful vocal performances and the colors with backgrounds are just incredible even some of the traditionally animated sequences done in 2D animation are superb. It's a fresh and creative adaptation of the book without bathroom humor or reused jokes but good timed humor, the film does offer a big moral that sends out like a message to the audience as this is a must see animated movie.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray contains brilliant picture and awesome sound that makes you feel like you saw it at the theater! the extras are terrific like audio commentary, a sneek peek at \\"Ice Age 3\\", an \\"Ice Age\\" short, Picture-in-Picture bonus View where you watch the movie with a Who but only if you have a Bonus-View enabled player. Digital Copy, Featurettes, deleted scenes, animation screen tests, and game.
B001G9LVGG|2.0|I found A Midwinter Night's Dream to be a mixture of fairly nice songs mixed in with several very annoying songs which ruined the CD for me.  I cannot listen to it without running to the CD player to skip those songs that raise my blood pressure.  It was billed as a good accompaniment to the new Enya CD which I enjoy a great deal more.  The cover work is beautiful but, since the music isn't, it is not (in my opinion) worth buying.
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|Heath Ledger is dead, and this is the role that, more or less, lead to his death. He showed promise with Brokeback Mountain and in The Dark Knight he cements the fact that he was more than just that guy from that teen movie that was based on a work by Shakespeare, but it won't happen.    Oddly enough, this isn't the only saddening part about the film; pretty much every aspect is, other than Ledger's pitch perfect performance. It needs to be said: Christian Bale cannot act; ok he did a marvelous job in The Prestige, but that's a one time deal apparently. He's a horrid batman, not as bad as Clooney, but he's still unwatchable. Batman's supposed to have a gruff voice, I know this, but it's not supposed to sound like he's belching his lines, it's that simple.    For a film that's over 2 hours long it sure promised a lot, built up a great deal of expectations and then just completely fizzled by the end of it.    I'm sick of Morgan Freeman always, ALWAYS, playing the same role; the old wise man with an insightful perspective and reserved manner; does the man have no range? Please, someone give me a pointer to a film where he doesn't do the same old. Maggie Gyllenhall was absolutely awful as well, my lord, the bad performances are everywhere, so much so that they basically could have just edited it to the point where it's all Ledger's show and nothing else.    The directing was nothing special, the story wasn't anything they couldn't have fit into a 23 minute episode of the cartoon, and the attempt to resonate a deep philosophical perspective is marred by the fact that it's just not well written or acted or directed. For an action film it certainly was incredibly tedious and unbearably slow.    Nobody better try to feed me anything about this being a character study, or a comic book movie for adults; because it's not, you're fooling yourself if this is your frame of mind. It's a popcorn movie, a summer cash in, and nothing more; well, there's the cornerstone of nihilism that is The Joker, but other than that you're better off watching Killer Klowns from Outer Space.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I like Enya so found And Winter Came to be quite nice.  If you like Enya, you will probably enjoy this CD; it is typical Enya.  If an artist or group has found a niche that people enjoy, it is probably fine that they do not go out of their element and create music that is too different from what is expected.  It is refreshing to have winter or holiday music that is pleasant and not a rerun of what is heard daily on the radio or on many other Christmas CDs.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I used to like Coldplay.  I cant say that I like this album very much.  After listening to Viva La Vida, I heard that they stole the song from Joe Satriani.  I have to say that Joe has a much better sounding song.  Joe should be thanking Coldplay though, because now Ive gone out and bought the album from Joe.
B001H5X7I4|2.0|If Tropic Thunder were half as funny as it obviously thinks it is, then it might have been something special.  Despite the talent involved with this movie (Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Tom Cruise, etc.) it seems as though everyone involved knows how brilliantly talented and funny they are and how funny the premise is and all they have to do is show up and the movie will be great.  Uh...wrong.  You actually have to work at comedy...it's hard!<br /><br />One of the main problems with the movie is that it is torn between what kind of comedy it wants to be.  Part of it wants to be a stinging criticism of the entire movie industry and the other half wants to be a shameless, raunchy comedy that will offend everyone.  It doesn't succeed on either front.  The satire of the movie feels dated and obvious.  Who doesn't know that Hollywood is full of self absorbed actors, ruthless studio heads and sleazy agents?  The part of the movie that wants to go for pure raunchiness and politically incorrect humor doesn't quite work because the movie's idea of this type of humor seems to be to use as much profanity as possible.  There's no inspired insanity behind all of the R rated shenanigans.  If the movie is trying to cash in on the post-Apatow comedy landscape, it seems to be missing the point.<br /><br />Not that the movie is terrible.  There are some funny moments, some chuckles and grins, but no belly laughs.  The two key performances that have received rave reviews, Tom Cruise's heartless studio exec and Downey Jr's method actor aren't quite as brilliant as they've been made out to be.  Cruise, and a lot of critics, apparently thought that simply yelling and using profanity was comic gold.  I disagree.  As for Robert Downey Jr, his transformation into an African-American soldier is quite amazing, but only from a visual standpoint.  The character that Downey creates is mostly forgettable, just like most of this overblown and overhyped comedy.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I've said this before, elsewhere: I am a manly man. But, occasionally, even manly men are cowed by their better halves. So one day I was \\"convinced\\" to sit down and watch this film. And, because even manly men can channel their more refined dimensions (and without forfeiting their man card), I ended up digging MAMMA MIA and, dammit, even humming some of these Abba songs!<br /><br />The set-up goes like this: It's just before Sophie's wedding, and preparations are lively. But there's just one thing missing to make it all perfect: her father to give her away. All her life, Sophie had gone on, not knowing who her dad is. But then she stumbles upon her mother Donna's diary and discovers that her dad could be one of three possible men. All with whom, the diary states, her mother had spent time, with one thing leading to another, and dot dot dot... Unbeknownst to Donna, Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. And, then, fun shenanigans.<br /><br />For those who've signed up for FeelGoodology 101, know that the first thing the professor does in class is pop in this DVD. Say what you will about MAMMA MIA, kibitz about the campy elements or grouse that some or most of the cast can't carry a tune, but that doesn't alter the fact that this musical simply makes you feel good. I've never seen Meryl Streep in a role like this, which just goes to show that the woman can officially do anything in the acting gig. Pierce Brosnan, no, he can't sing, but so what? He, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard come in with good humor and grace. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is so damn engaging and so hopefully wistful that she's the perfect choice to open the movie with, because her plight immediately draws you into the story. And she can sing. Her vibrant rendition of \\"Honey Honey\\" is an exercise in exuberance and catchiness. It may be my favorite song, up there with \\"Chiqitita,\\" \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" and \\"Dancing Queen,\\" this last one to which I, thankfully, managed to abstain from humming along (for I am a manly man and not some disco dude).<br /><br />There's not much here that's rooted in reality, and it's fine. Every now and then, this type of film is exactly what I'm looking for, especially when one's down in the dumps. MAMMA MIA is a fable, full of warmth and great energy and vivid colors. It's set on a stunning Greek island and boasts its very own spirited Greek chorus, which does just fine going into backup singers mode. You get the happy ending that was never in doubt. And, instead of one Prince Charming, the movie presents three.<br /><br />What I've got is the single disc DVD. Its special features include lukewarm audio commentary by Director Phyllida Lloyd (who also directed the stage productions of MAMMA MIA) and the deleted musical number \\"The Name of the Game.\\" And, ooooh, there's an option to play the movie with on-screen lyrics for the musical numbers! And an option to skip right to a song. Score, baby!<br /><br />Okay. And now I'm gonna watch some football (please don't take away my man card).ong (for I am a manly man and not some disco dude).<br /><br />There's not much here that's rooted in reality, and it's fine.

1589944607|5.0|This is one of those board games you could wonder about - are they just trying to cash in on a known franchise name? Not here - Fanatasy Flight has a reputation for making outstanding board games and this one is no exception. It has very high quality pieces, cards, and miniatures that complement the fantastic game mechanics. While the game itself is tailored to the Battlestar Galactica universe - and captures that essence - it also has a well thought out game system that keeps players coming back. Equally enjoyable by BSG fans and novices. This will be one of those games that makes you plan events just to play it.

0792160347|4.0|A slick L.A. callboy finds love & redemption in Paul Schrader's ultra-stylish drama. High-living prostitute Julian Kay (Richard Gere stepping in for John Travolta) has it all: the Mercedes the clothes access to Beverly Hills' swankiest establishments and a stable of rich older female clients, but it all falls apart after he does a favor for his former pimp (Bill Duke)and the trick turns up dead a short while later; Julian's actual client won't give him an alibi and police Det. Sunday (Hector Elizondo) doesn't believe the gigolo's denials.<br /><br />The one person who can help him is frustrated politician's wife (and sole non-paying bedmate) Michelle (Lauren Hutton) if only Julian could let down his defenses and accept her gesture of love. Mixing his admiration for European art cinema with a voyeuristic view of the seamier side of sex & affluence Schrader renders Julian an inscrutable emotionally disengaged purveyor of pleasure decked out in Giorgio Armani clothes coordinated with Ferdinando Scarfiotti's meticulous production design & lots of graphic nudity.<br /><br />Amid critical doubts about its artiness and distanced eroticism AMERICAN GIGALO surprised everyone by not dying on the box office vine when it was theatrically released in the Winter of 1980 with some audiences reportedly showing up for repeat viewings of Gere's seductive charms it became a moderate hit turning Gere into a star and Armani into the new fashion sensation.<br /><br />Whatever reservations one may have about the movie it provided two indelible images of 1980s decadence to come: Gere's perusing his artist's palette of shirts ties and jackets and Gere's cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway in his convertible to the New Wave strains of Blondie's \\"Call Me\\".<br /><br />Therefore, with nobody to help Julian, he ends up in jail awaiting trial for the murder, but when all seems lost, Michelle risks her own reputation and her husbands to provide Julian with the alibi that can save him from going to prison.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I personally really like it.  I enjoyed it just as much as the other books.  It was exciting, enjoyable, and creative.  I dont want to spoil it to any of you so just trust my words.

6305428425|5.0|I thought ROMEY & MICHELLES HIGH SCHOOL REUNION was an awesome hilarious movie about 2 not so bright Southern Californian blondes who attend their 10-year class reunion in Tucson who have nothing special or remarkable to share with their former classmates at the reunion, but Romey & Michelle(Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow)end up getting their little sweet revenge on all the people who wronged them in high school at the conclusion of this movie when Romey & Michelle make up and put an end to their differences with a great happy ending of this movie when Romey & Michelle start a clothing business in L.A. along with the fact that justice gets served when Romey & Michelle get their little sweet revenge against the ruthless & snotty gals who picked on them all throughout high school and against the popular jock boy who stood Romey up on prom night in the Spring of 1987.<br /><br />ROMEY & MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL reunion also plays a lot of cool classic songs from the 1980's like TURNING JAPANESE by The Vapors, KARMA CHAMELEON by Culture Club, OUR LIPS ARE SEALED by The Go Go's, I WANT CANDY by Bow Wow Wow, HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH by Belinda Carlise, EVERYBODY HAVE FUN TONIGHT by Wang Chung, WE'VE GOT THE BEAT by The Go Gos, etc., plus Romey & Michelle's High School Reunion was also like a movie that took us back to memory lane on life in the 80's.<br /><br />The only thing that sucked was in this movie they played the songs FOOTLOOSE by Kenny Loggins and DON'T GET ME WRONG by The Pretenders, which are 2 classics from the 1980's that I really liked, but unfortunately neither song came out on either of the ROMEY & MICHELLE'S movie soundtracks that were released on CD back in the Spring of 1997 when this movie was released in the theatres by May of '97.<br /><br />I also think this was Lisa Kudrows best performance in all the movies she's ever done and was even more impressive than her ditzy Pheobe Buffay character on FRIENDS.
B001NB6IN8|4.0|Fall Out Boy is perhaps the one band that most defines what alternative punk/pop/emo rock is to today's record-buying public, with 2005's From Under The Cork Tree and 2007's Infinity On High garnering massive commercial success.  On Folie A Deux, their 5th studio album, they've honed their formula for success and crafted songs that, to my ears, should satisfy core fans and newcomers alike.    On the majority of these tracks, the experimentation and mixing of musical styles and genres occur on either side of a very strong, melodic, mainstream rock chorus...in other words, F.O.B. has at least one section of every song they can hang their hat on; it doesn't seem to matter how far they stray from the 'conventional' approach to writing a rock song, at some point in each track you will hear familiarity (great sounding choruses).    The record's production is very \\"BIG\\"-sounding...typical F.O.B. trademarks, like multiple layers of vocals with plenty of \\"Whoa's\\" and \\"Oh's\\" and chants, tight harmonies, and great variety with instrumentation seem to have been emphasized...but I wouldn't necessarily say it's overproduced.  Even though the arrangements can get a little 'busy' at times, Pete Wentz (bass guitar, lyrics) and Patrick Stump (vocals) somehow make the chaos work, and we end up hearing some very creative, interesting, and catchy music.     The first track, \\"Disloyal Order...\\", has about 4 different 'verse' sections, including an organ-based opening and a guitar chord progression reminiscent of The Who's \\"Teenage Wasteland\\", before it even gets to what might be considered the 'chorus'.  But with each listen, this song just gets better and better, and I feel it's one of the album's best tracks.    On \\"America's Suitehearts\\", the verse gives you no clue as to the powerful, melodic rock chorus that follows it, and the album's first single, \\"I Don't Care\\", based on another classic guitar riff, is probably the most straight-forward, radio-friendly track.  \\"What A Catch, Donnie\\" is a slower, piano-based, dramatically produced song that I find very moving.  The first eight tracks are all solid, along with \\"Tiffany Blews\\" and \\"20 Dollar Nose Bleed\\".    The inclusion of what I consider to be 'just average' songs (\\"27\\", \\"w.a.m.s.\\", \\"West Coast Smoker\\") is the only reason I drop this from 5 stars to four; otherwise, I feel Folie A Deux is top-notch, and I would definitely recommend it.

B0002C4JE4|5.0|I remember listening to James Taylor as a teenager, sitting in the back seat of my 1965 GTO. I always knew that once he started to sing a kiss wasn't far behind. I received my three CDs, placed them in my car player and sure enough within a short time everyone of those sweet moments came rushing back. James Taylor is almost as great as those first few kisses. I would recomend all of the CDs to anyone wanting to remember those great times in their life.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|A huge Enya fan, I was disappointed in this album after the long wait.  It's way too Christmasy for me.  It also seemed uninspired, and lacking the usual few outstanding songs that make her albums worth buying even if only one song was one of her best.<br />I've only played it once, so hopefully some songs will grow on me as they tend to do....I first heard her once, not paying attention, and months later I heard her again and a light went on in my brain!  Her music had been percolating into my soul for a while.<br />Don't let me put you off.  Keep an open mind and maybe your first listen will be fine.  At least it's not a compilation of her old stuff. If you're an Enya fan, you gotta have it anyway, of course! ;)
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Okay so im not normally a fan of rock & roll but ive been feeling to listen to music thats a little more edgy than pop & r&b lately.. I began to explore the indie & alternative rock music scene, primarily UK artists such as Muse, Keane etc.. I was on amazon's UK site browsing for rock music when 'Only by the night' came up as one of their best selling albums and the reviewer mentioned that Kings of Leon is one of the UK's favorite American rock bands. I was intrigued and decided to check the album out.  When I received the CD i was blown away! The lead singers voice is so raw & full of SOUL! And the guitar harmonies jesus! Are these guys siamese triplets? The guitar sounds just blow my mind, the syncronicity between the vocals & the background musical harmonies is truly amazing. Its nice to have an album where every piece that is played - be it drums, bass, lead guitar or vocals stands out as being brilliant while no one really shows up the other. I also love the southern flavor to the music. This album is well balanced and fresh and edgy and has a nice rawness to it. Im a fan tracks like Sex on fire, 17 and Manhattan but truly I love them all! Its the first album i've heard in a long time I want to listen to over and over again :D  Overall 5 stars! :D
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I heard Duffy on a Luftansa soundtrack two moths ago (Stepping Stone). I was blown away by this voice and searched in vain. Then I heard this song coverered in a Munich club by a Duffy look alike. I finally was able to hunt her down and am very glad I did. I am a huge Dusty Springfield fan and this artist is a gem who will only grow in importance as her career advances.     I fear for Amy Winehouse, another big talent, but I see Duffy as the real deal. May she have great success. There is not a bad track on this whole CD.

The show is excelent and even though the first season only ran for half a season due to the writers strike, the publisher did its best to add in enough special features to justify the cost. My only complaint is that the packaging was slightly damaged on the inside.

I felt drawn into her world of sonic mastery.  Thank you enya for a wonderful Holiday !

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Let me just start off by saying...WOW! In my opinion this is the best movie of all time. It passes those horrible supposed greatest movies of all time like Gone with the Wind and Wizard of Oz. Those movies were predictable. Best musical I've ever seen!!!!! Lets start off with the music. Though Abba was a great band in the 70's, this movie did not ruin my thoughts towards the music. In fact I liked the cast singing Abba's songs then Abba themselves. This movie did Abba's music Justice!!! The casting for the movie was stupendous. Meryl Streep's voice was breath taking in this movie! The emotion she used in the songs were great. The other stars were great, but not going to mention all and ruin the surprises of the film. Some of the parts in the film were very comedic with a little pizaz.         Features some great songs such as   Mamma Mia   Lay all your love on me  Thw winner takes it all(favorite of mine)  Money Money Money  Honey Honey  Take a Chance on Me  and many more.....................          All in All I give this movie 5 stars...10 out of ten...I'd go higher if I could in rating...But I think you get my point...    This 2 disc set is definitly worth the price including some exciting extras and deleted scenes and musical numbers not used in the film...
B001G60FTI|5.0|This book just makes you see things entirely different. It is absolutely amazing. Malcom Gladwell is a great writer and thinker. I definitely  recommend this book.
0316017922|2.0|A criticism common to both Malcolm Gladwell's previous books, [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]] and [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]], was that while they were packed with interesting, well told, anecdotes there was no consistent underlying theme to the stories; no particular lesson to be drawn. For example, of the many anecdotes recounted about \\"thin slicing\\" some (such as an art expert's ability to instantly assess the bona fides of a statue) suggested it was a special and important skill while others (an impulsive police decision to pursue and shoot dead a innocent bystander) suggested quite the opposite. You were left with the impression that, well, there are these things called snap judgements, and sometimes they work out, and sometimes they don't.<br /><br />Clearly Malcolm Gladwell has taken those reservations to heart: in Outliers he has been scrupulous to sketch out an integrated underlying thesis and then (for the most part) array his anecdotes - which, as usual, are interesting enough - in support of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately for him, the theory is a lemon. Nonetheless, the flyleaf is hubristic (and unimaginative) enough to claim \\"This book really will change the way you think about your life\\". It's not done that for me, but it has changed the way I think about Malcolm Gladwell's writing. And not for the better.<br /><br />Gladwell has looked at some psychological research into success and genius and has concluded that, contrary to conventional wisdom, success isn't to be explained by raw talent. The evidence suggests that genuinely exceptional performers, in whatever field - these are the titular \\"outliers\\" - can be identified by a combination of unique and unusual *opportunity* and *commitment* to achieve. It isn't talent, but graft and the odd lucky break. Hmm.<br /><br />A common thread, Gladwell claims, is that most \\"world class experts\\", be they \\"composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, what have you ...\\" have put in 10,000 hours of practice before really achieving success. So, as the paradigm case goes, the Beatles weren't just in the right place at the right time (though clearly they were), but were instead preternaturally prepared for it by their grueling stint playing hundreds of eight-hour shows in Hamburg, an experience which afforded them both the necessary period of time and unusual opportunity to gain musical proficiency.<br /><br />The first quibble here is to note that (even allowing for the patent fantasy that the Beatles played eight-hours non stop each night), on Gladwell's own figures, the Hamburg experience - which didn't involve Ringo Starr - still left the band roughly 8,000 hours short of their necessary 10,000. In any case attributing the Beatles' success to their (undisputed) musical proficiency indicates the degree to which Gladwell misses the point, both about rock 'n' roll (wherein neither concerted effort nor musical acumen has often had much to do with initial commercial success - just ask Elvis or the Rolling Stones) and the quality of the data itself. Gladwell's theory suffers from survivor bias: it starts with an undisputed result (the Beatles - clearly an outlier) and works back looking for evidence to support its hypothesis and takes whatever is there: easy enough to do since the \\"evidence\\" is definable only in terms of the subsequently occuring success. In less polite circles this is called revisionism.<br /><br />There will, after all, be no record of the poor loser who spent 10,000 hours at his fretboard and who squandered a wealth of opportunity through ineptitude or bad luck, because, by definition, he never caught the light. Even if you grant Gladwell his theory - and I'm not inclined to - the most that can be said is that he's found a *correlation* between graft and success. But to confuse correlation with causation is acardinal sin of interpretation (see Stephen Jay Gould's splendid [[ASIN:0393314251 The Mismeasure of Man]] for a compelling explanation of this fallacy) unless you have independent supporting grounds to justify the causal chain. Gladwell offers none: The Fab Four (well, Fab Three plus Pete Best) may have become a tighter band in Germany, but as Gladwell acknowledges there were many Liverpool bands in Hamburg at the time, all presumably clocking up eight hours non-stop (yeah, right) per night, and none of the others made the cover of Rolling Stone then, or has done since.<br /><br />Much of the rest of Gladwell's patter is similarly glib: look at any \\"success story\\" long enough and you're bound to find something in its past you can designate as the crucial 10,000 hours. But to imply - as Gladwell seems to - that it isn't special talent but nothing more than sheer grit and unique opportunity that creates Outliers seems fatuous, and liable to needlessly encourage a class of plodders who will end up very disappointed (and resentful of M. Gladwell, Esq.) in 10 years' time. It struck me when I listened to him speak in London last month that the 10,000 hours might just as easily be confirmation, rather than falsification, of the presence of raw talent. If you take two violinists, one tone deaf and the other unusually gifted, all else being equal, who is more likely to stick at it for the ten years it takes to achieve concert level proficiency?<br /><br />To be sure there are some fascinating lessons to be drawn here, but precisely at the point where Gladwell allows himself to drift off the moorings of his underlying theory: ethnic theory of plane crashes, which seemed to establish very little about outliers even on his argument, is cogent (and in these melting markets, timely) caution as to the risks of autocratic behaviour. Towards the end of the book Gladwell reaches some uneasy conclusions that, based on the extraordinary results of Asian schoolchildren in mathematics, that US schools should effectively abandon summer holidays and have children attend school all year round, like they might if they were working in a rice paddy. I'm not convinced that more school (as opposed to better parenting) is the answer.<br /><br />It was my fortune to be reading Steve Gould's classic tome on scientific sceptism at the same time I read (and listened to) Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell's prescriptions are analogous with the flawed IQ testing programmes Gould so elegantly takes to task: the hypothesis comes first, and the intellectual process behind it is the search for evidence in support of it rather than a dispassionate attempt to falsify. It is hard to imagine how one would go about falsifying (or proving, other than anecdotally) Gladwell's theory and even harder to conceive what prospective use Gladwell's learning, if true, could be. Seeing as the \\"golden opportunities\\" can only be identified with hindsight - once your outlier is already lying out there, this feels like the sort of junk science with all the trappings - and utility - of 20:20 rear vision.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonay Gould's splendid [[ASIN:0393314251 The Mismeasure of Man]] for a compelling explanation of this fallacy) unless you have independent supporting grounds to justify the causal chain.

I've given a couple of his other books a glance - everyone deserves a second chance, no? Unfortunately I have found the others similarly disappointing.   His little stitched-together anecdotes are weak attempts at humor that don't come off funny and only make him seem more pathetic in the telling.

0670020745|3.0|I would agree with other reviewers that the value of this book is in the author's \\"spiritual awakening\\" as the result of her stroke. While I also find her descriptions too New Agey for my taste, I was envious of her new-found ability to turn off her inner critical and judgmental voices and stay in the moment with joy and gratefulness. Christians (and adherents to other faiths, I imagine) are forever trying to get to that place. I, for one, find it nearly impossible.<br /><br />I have to commend the author for taking away valuable life lessons from her medical emergency, unlike Amy Silverstein in her book [[ASIN:0802143873 Sick Girl]]. I, too, had a medical emergency this past year and was surprised and relieved to find that feeling close to death was not the entirely terrifying experience I expected. I had feelings of regret, but found I was not afraid of what was to come. The memory of it has provided me with courage to face the future, knowing the end may be more bearable than I ever imagined. In my way of thinking about it, which may differ from this author's, no matter how dreadful our end-of-life experiences may be, God is merciful.
B000LE16VW|5.0|What a great movie. I have seen it on VHS but had to have it on DVD.
B0011HF6GE|4.0|I can see why reaction to Bon Iver is so fragmented. There are those who hail it an instant epic, and others who think its pastoral nonsense. I'm somewhat in the middle - granted, these sorts of slow burner indie-folk albums aren't for everybody, but there is definitely something more special about this particular album - more so because its a concept album about that most universal of animals - lost love.<br /><br />While the harmonies here are subdued and very, very slow-paced, the atmosphere of the entire album is what makes it work. There is a heady iciness to the entire venture, a sort of morbid sadness even, one that permeates every single track. Like Camille's \\"Le Fil\\" which had a drone running through each song (and for minutes after the last song played), this mood of sombre melancholy is present in spades on this album, and this also works for it.<br /><br />The centerpiece is the two-suite \\"The Wolves\\" and the luminous \\"Team\\". None of these songs work especially well on their own. Like any good novel, each song blends into the other so that the album needs to be listened to in chronological order. Bon Iver's mastery of the sparse musical medium is astounding, and the way he makes every track here speak its' own unique brand of solitudinal longing, is a work of art waiting to be unraveled.<br /><br />For many people who read this positive review, you might well buy this album and be shocked by the 'dull', 'slow' songs therein. This is in part true. It takes a while to 'get' what the artist is trying to accomplish here, but if you approach this as a rich experimental piece worth investing in, you just might reap some invaluable rewards.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|I've not been a fan of Dylan's albums as I could never get past his voice! Love his music, his lyrics etc, but that voice just grated so much that one listening a year would be enough. Now at last, on this album he has found a quality that works for me. Over the past year, I have listened to this album many times and can still listen to it. It's obviously not his best work, but it's damn fine - and listenable, and that makes it one very special Dylan album for me.     Love the title track - but it sort of makes me a bit sad and nostalgic when I listen to it as I'm sure I can hear John Lee being channeled.

She builds her case with facts and presents a damning picture of the people that we thought we could trust to manage our society.  I was especially intrigued by the clear connection between natural or man-made diasters and the loss of freedoms that we take for granted.

0316067601|4.0|This book is part military memoir and partly an account of Operation Redwing, in which three members of a four-man SEAL team were killed in the mountains of Afghanistan, followed by a number of others lost when a relief/rescue helicopter was shot down.<br /><br />The author starts out describing his visits to the loved ones of his dead comrades.  In the process, he introduces us to the other members of the team.  Then he goes into retrospective mode and describes how they were deployed to Afghanistan.  While on the plane, there is a long flashback to Luttrell's personal story and how he and his hometown friends trained to become SEALs, and then the agonies and challenges of SEAL training itself.  I felt that this account of SEAL training was one of the most evocative I have ever read.<br /><br />The author makes periodic comments about how the \\"rules of engagement\\" as composed by stateside lawyers and politicians are completely ineffective to the situation on the ground, hamstringing the troops with burdensome worries as to whether they will be summarily put on trial for \\"war crimes\\" with every use of force decision they make.  It seemed to me that he returned to this concept quite often, that it was an axe he had to grind.  The point of this emphasis becomes more clear as the story unfolds.<br /><br />When they are in Afghanistan, the author is sent out into a rugged mountainous area to attempt to kill/capture a notorious local Taliban leader.  They lack good intelligence as to all the factors of the situation, particularly how the terrain is so rugged that they can barely keep their footing on the steep slopes, and there is next to no cover for them to hide in as they approach the leader's location.  As they move toward their position, it seems odd that they would banter back and forth while on an operation, even going so far as to toss berries at each other.  With this level of vigilance, it is perhaps not surprising when they are suddenly surprised by three silent-footed Afghan herdsmen, one of whom is a boy.  They detain the trio and debate whether they should kill them in order to prevent a \\"hue and cry\\" to their quarry.  However, the \\"rules of engagement\\" technically prevent them from military expediency, since the herdsmen are obviously noncombatants, at least at the moment, and even if the SEALS kill them, it is likely that the team's cover will be blown (because the herd of meandering animals will also draw attention when the herdsmen are missed).  At this point, the mission should probably have been aborted, but instead the group takes a \\"vote,\\" after not being able to reach headquarters for guidance, and the vote is 2 against killing/1 for/1 abstention.  Thus, the herdsmen are released, and the SEALs once again settle into their vigil.  Not long afterward, however, they are engaged by a large force of several hundred Taliban - the herdsmen did betray them after all.  Then commences a long running disengagement as the team is rapidly wounded, several of them with multiple severe wounds, until one by one they are killed, leaving Luttrell literally blown off the scene to fall further down the hill.  Then begins a long escape and evasion in which Luttrell fights his own wounds to try and survive and find water.  Eventually he comes across a group of friendly Afghan Pashtun who aid him and protect him from the Taliban until he can be evacuated several days later.  The action alternates with scenes of the author's family holding vigil at home in Texas, waiting to hear news of his fate.  After his recovery, the author meets President Bush and then begins his rounds of visits to his buddies' loved ones.<br /><br />The book is a very engaging story, with a description of the battle that puts the reader there for every explosion and bullet wound.  The desciption of SEAL training is worth a book in itself.  The author's heroism is beyond reproach.  My only critique is that the book does seem a bit rambling, particularly in the beginning, and perhaps could have benefited from some additional editing.  But the author has certainly earned the right to tell his story any way he wants to.  This book will make the reader appreciate the level of sacrifice, commitment, and loss that are ongoing to help protect our freedom and security here at home.ld have benefited from some additional editing.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I can't say anything about the format, as I got it off iTunes, but Joss Whedon, and his brother Jed, do a fine job of pulling this thing together.  Dr. Horrible is one of the more entertaining things I've seen this last year.<br /><br />Here's what I learned - multiple viewings really help you enjoy Dr.Horrible all that much more.  The nuances of the performances are much nore enhanced the more you watch it (really, watch Captain Hammer's face when he sings about 'just might sleep with the same girl twice' and his reaction to the background singers who pop in).<br /><br />Ditto with the music.  At first, I found it to be slightly throw-away, but you know what?  It works.  Yeah, NPH's voice is stronger and better trained than Nathan Fillon or Felicia Day's, but they all work - especially the harmonizing.<br /><br />I've become a big fan of \\"Brand New Day\\", \\"My Eyes\\" and especially \\"So They Say\\".  They constantly play in my head - for better or worse.<br /><br />In whatever format, for some light hearted fun, I think folks should check it out.  Most folks still don't know Fillon and Day, and MPH hasn't been Doogie for a long long long time.<br /><br />And seriously, how can you not love Moist?
B001DHXT20|4.0|Zak Penn who wrote \\"X-Men 3,\\" \\"Fantastic Four\\" & \\"Elektra\\" did the screenplay for \\"The Incredible Hulk.\\"  Louis Leterrier who was second unit director on [[ASIN:B00008AOVL The Transporter]] & promoted to director on [[ASIN:B000BTITKS Transporter 2]] took the helm and kept the pace moving as the special effects shine.<br /><br />The reason this film works so well is that Edward Norton is an amazing actor.  He adds reality and commitment to even the comic book world of the Hulk.  Norton has two Oscar nominations for \\"Primal Fear\\" in 1996 & \\"American History X\\" in 1998.  He was nominated as Best Actor by the Independent Spirit Awards for the lyrical and moving [[ASIN:B000NOIX48 The Painted Veil]].  As Bruce, his calm demeanor is the perfect foil for the wild anger of the Hulk.<br /><br />Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross (sounds like Betsy Ross) who was in love with Bruce.  She carries her torch for him and serves as the damsel in distress.  Oscar winner William Hurt plays Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross, a military man who wears his patriotism with blinders on & places his own career interest above his daughter's love & respect.  Tim Roth does a great job as the loony Emil Blonsky who transforms into a bigger hulk.  Tim Blake Nelson was named Best Director for \\"O\\" by the Seattle International Film Festival.  In this film he plays Samuel Sterns, aka Mr. Blue, who is jazzed about the scientific possibilities that the Hulk's physiology contains.  Ty Burrell who was in \\"Black Hawk Down\\" has a strong appearance as Leonard, Betty's new beau who sticks up for her to her father, even after she's dropped everything to help Bruce.  Christina Cabot who was in [[ASIN:B0001AP0MW The Maldonado Miracle]] has a strong showing as Major Kathleen Sparr who stands up for what's right.  The DVD deleted scenes are interesting.  The Brazilian scenes immerse us in an exotic culture.  This is a film that is able to rivet us because of the excellent elements and Edward Norton's outstanding screen presence.  Enjoy!

B0019T9FL6|4.0|Jennifer Hudson's departure from American Idol may have been one of the show's most shocking moments, yet it may have also enabled her career to take off. Without the overly restrictive Idol contract, Jennifer could take her time to craft a solid debut without pigeonholing herself into a single genre. News first came out that Jennifer had been instructed to change directions with the material, sparking some fears that this would prevent her from playing to her strengths, especially showcasing her incredible voice. Luckily, the final product kept its trendy-ness to a minimum while keeping an excellent balance between fresh sounds and showcasing the true talent.     The prime example would be lead single, \\"Spotlight\\", written by Ne-Yo and produced by Stargate. The track tells of an insecure boyfriend keeping tight reins to prevent Jennifer from finding someone better. While the production is impeccable, the focus is truly on the passionate yet controlled vocals as well as the honest lyrics. This was an excellent single choice, and an amazing way to start the album. \\"If This Isn't Love,\\" continues on in the same, radio-friendly vein that makes it an apt choice for the second single. It's another album highlight due to its heartfelt lyrics and stunning vocals. However, it is not quite as strong as the previous track but it's an excellent listen nonetheless. \\"Pocketbook\\" is a sassy, unexpected style featuring an interesting rap by Ludacris. This is one of the few tracks that received mixed reviews from fans, as it is generally seen as too \\"ghetto\\" for Jennifer. It does make for a welcome change from the slower pace of the majority of the album. The Robin Thicke penned \\"Giving Myself\\" is a decent ballad, which suffers most from its lack of anything truly memorable. While it is consistently an enjoyable, engaging song it tends to get lost among the other highlights. Nevertheless, as far as filler goes, this remains quite strong.      \\"What's Wrong\\" with an unnecessary guest spot from T-Pain reeks of unfulfilled potential, although none of it is Jennifer's fault. Although Jennifer sounds beautiful, T-Pain's entirely computerized vocals make it sound as though Jennifer is singing with a robot. What could have been a beautiful highlight had it featured a better male vocalist ends up being mediocre at best. Luckily, the album picks up strongly with the incredible \\"My Heart\\". This is easily the most underrated track the album has to offer. The lyrics are nice and simple, but it is the vocal performance that really sells it. The subdued production makes a nice contrast with Jennifer's strong vocals, making it a true album highlight. \\"You Pulled Me Through\\" is one of the better Diane Warren ballads in quite some time. Like \\"Giving Myself\\", it remains a strong albeit somewhat unmemorable album track. This one is slightly better as it contains a stronger bridge, both lyrically and vocally. While there is nothing in particular wrong with the track, it unfortunately remains one step below true excellence. \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" is widely hailed as this decade's version of \\"The Boy Is Mine\\", although most would agree it is not quite on the same level. Jennifer sounds excellent, although duet-partner Fantasia's voice is more of an acquired taste. Given this however, the track as a whole works quite well although also fails to truly reach highlight status.     In contrast however, lies the other underrated gem \\"Can't Stop the Rain\\". The strength of this track lies in its overall passion, which is evident in everything from the production to the lyrics. This track tells of the death of a friend in an accident, and Jennifer's feelings about the girlfriend he left behind. Chillingly, she sings, \\"somewhere in the deepest darkest piece of my mind, I wish it was her that died that night\\". It's brutal honesty, yet it makes the song that much more believable. \\"We Gon' Fight\\" has some of the strongest vocals, which fit well with the gospel-esque tone. The track may get a little repetitive during the chorus, but the verses compensate for the most part. It picks up especially during the bridge when it becomes truly engaging, bordering on show-stopping at times. This becomes an interesting track in the end, as it starts out quite mediocre but builds toward a stunning climax. \\"Invisible\\" is the album's final hidden gem, featuring more subdued vocals which fit with the production impeccably. It seems to be a sort of follow-up to \\"Spotlight\\", where Jennifer declares her independence from an unsatisfying relationship. The only thing that would have improved this track would have been downplaying the background vocals slightly in the chorus, but that's rather a trivial complaint.     Although many have pointed out that \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" was pointless to include on this album, it would have seemed incomplete without it. This is the biggest song of Jennifer's career thus far, owing to her acclaimed role in Dreamgirls, thus it makes sense she would want to include it. It is a truly show-stopping song that showcases the full extent of Jennifer's vocals both in terms of power and emotiveness. \\"Jesus Promised Me a Home\\" has Jennifer returning to her Gospel roots mentioned in American Idol, although it comes across as somewhat out of place among the rest of the material. Jennifer sounds beautiful, and it's a nice song if you like Gospel. For the more secular fans however, it may be a little hard to connect with. Finally, \\"All Dressed Up in Love\\" from the Sex and the City soundtrack brings the album to a close on an excellent note. It's easily one of the most upbeat tracks, thereby hinting that Jennifer is capable of pulling off quicker tempos than most of this album has to offer. This is an unexpected highlight as well, thereby allowing the album end with a track nearly as strong as the one it began with.    Overall Mark: 4/5     Jennifer Hudson has easily proved with this album that she left American Idol much too early, while simultaneously proving why it was better for her to be out of the competition. Unlike other Idol alumni, Jennifer has provided a rather consistent album that gives a defined sense of who she is as an artist. She remains one of the few who infuses their more radio friendly offerings with a message, or at the very least some sort of meaningful lyrics. With such a powerful voice, it would have been easy for Jennifer to go the middle-of-the-road route, and compile an album of very similar ballads that show off her technical skill but lack passion. Luckily, she decided to go the opposite route thereby securing her debut as one of the stronger offerings of the year, as well as hinting at significant quantities of potential for future albums of the same calibre.

B00005JMXX|3.0|When the movie made its big-screen debut in 2004 - and continuing with the various DVD releases - debate oftentimes degenerated into questioning the actual validity of the global warming/cooling that is depicted, while seemingly forgetting that this is a Sci-Fi action adventure. It would be like giving opinions on The Da Vinci Code and One Million Years B.C. as if the films are based on historical facts.<br /><br />Produced, directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich, the special effects are absolutely incredible, but the story stumbles due to the generic characters that can plague this genre; arrogant politicians, misunderstood scientists and practical voices continually lost in the wilderness of society.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is climatologist Jack Hall who valiantly tries to make the top political leaders in Washington, D.C., understand the harsh ramifications of the emerging storms worldwide. After tackling this tough task, he sets forth on a journey through massive ice and snow to rescue his son (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who is trapped in New York City. Throughout the sojourn, both characters play off the themes of friendship, family and the will to survive.<br /><br />There is a nice mix of special features - including scenes edited out of the film - that are interesting. But the storms steal the show and wash away a script that was built around the big bang of special effects and had cardboard cut-outs for characters.

We actually bought it on Blu-ray and it is beautiful to watch.  The action scenes are awesome, the message is solid.  There is humor for both children and adults.  It enraptured my two year old son and now we often here him yelling \\"Watch Panda, watch Panda!\\"<br /><br />Even better is it is a movie kids can be active to.  My son punched and kicked right along with the characters in the movie.  He also very seriously stated \\"Mama, I know KungFu...\\"<br /><br />I've seen this movie three times now, thanks to my son, and every time I watch it I see something I didn't notice before.  It is a great watch and never gets boring.  Of course I might not be saying that after I've watched it 20 times, but so far so good.<br /><br />Very impressive animated Kung Fu movie.  A billion times better than I thought it would be.
B001GKJ2DO|2.0|Let's  face it:  The very idea that not just one, but all three of the invited men, would just simply drop their families, their jobs, and other commitments in their very busy lives, and all three of them invest substantial time and money to fly across the Atlantic to Greece (assuming they could even acquire passports in time) is ridiculous and implausible.  For such a scenario to fall in place would never happen in a million years.
B0013D8LOU|1.0|I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this film. This is probably one of the worst cast's I have ever seen for this show. Most of the people cast in this movie couldn't even hold a note and did not portray the character's well at all.<br /><br />A huge disappointment. I've seen the show on Broadway and at many regional theatre's and this is the worst production I've ever seen of the show.
1569242739|5.0|I chose to make the Basic Chocolate Cupcakes filled with Peanut Buttercream Frosting and topped with the Rich Chocolate Ganache.  They turned out perfect!  The cupcakes were moist and chocolaty, the frosting was light yet full of peanut butter flavor, and the ganache was heaven in my mouth.  These are much better than the fanciest cupcakes at the most expensive bakeries, and they were fun to make!

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I had never seen the musical or knew anything about it except for the commercials and what I read about the reviews.  Knowing most of my favorite movies are hated by critics, I knew I had to see it.  On my birthday in August, I decided to see Mamma Mia instead of Dark Knight.  Beside dealing with getting a year older, the economic outlook, gas prices and everything else going on just made me want an escape where it took me away from the dismal real life crap.  Mamma Mia did that.  I adore Pierce Bronsan and no one can claim he is a great singer, but he did it.  Colin Firth wasn't much better.  The good thing was the theater wasn't that full and so I hope no one heard me much singing along.  I did hear others laugh their heads off and sing too.    Mamma Mia also dealt with life changes and shows how important our friends and family are for good and bad times.  We also have to be able to laugh at ourselves, even when not wearing polyester and platform boots.
0790749858|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my son's 15th birthday, he had not seen the movie since he was about 8 or 9 when the last video copy of this movie died.  When he used to watch it he would play along with a nurf basketball and hoop.  As he watched it this time he didn't play basketball, but said that he didn't remember it being so funny.  He has watched it a few times since he got it mostly when his friends are over.    It's a classic and the whole family have enjoyed watching is again.  It's a must have for basketball fans.      My son is and was a HUGH Micheal Jordon fan and LOVES basketball, it's he's favorite sport.

0060899190|4.0|I received this book as a gift and read it that night, in one sitting. I just couldn't stop sifting through the secrets on each page. So many were funny, disturbing, or heart-wrenching. And I could relate to so many of them.<br /><br />The artwork on the postcards ranges from quick sketches to gorgeous collage but, with every piece of art so personal, it's easy to get caught up in each image. The only complaint I have is with the two-page spreads. When the text runs over two pages, the binding can make it hard to read. I wish everything had been printed in its original size or on a single page.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book, full of so much of the human experience. It made me wonder what my secrets would be.
B001E75QGG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and rate it at four well earned stars.  I believe the quality of the special effects were excellent and the story very good as well. The transfer quality of the Blu-Ray DVD was one of the best I have ever watched and helped make this movie special for me since my first viewing of this film was on my large screen home theater.<br /><br />I am surprised that this film scored such a flat 3 star rating but the statistics are what they are. These statistics probably reflect as much about us, the audience growing old watching Indiana Jones films as the movie makers.  All in all, I think it was a very good effort and within my small group of movie going friends I know this film was well thought of and provided a very entertaining evening.
0439023483|5.0|HOLY COW!!!!  I could NOT put this book down!    While it starts off a little slow, as it provides background information to set the reader up for the plot, the pace drastically picks up as soon as Katniss and Peeta are chosen for the competition.    I am a seventh grade English teacher and presented this book to my students today as a Book Talk.  Needless to say, after choosing to read aloud the pivotal scene involving Rue, I now have a waiting list to check the book out!      The novel will appeal to both boys and girls; even though the main character is a girl, there is enough attention paid to the boy characters to keep boy readers engaged.  Not to mention, there are plenty of action-packed, violent scenes that will delight the male readers who love that sort of stuff!  It sucks the girls in, too, because there is such an emotional edge to it.    Walk, don't run, to your nearest store and pick up a copy NOW.  The last page of the book says \\"End of Book One\\" and I am hoping and praying that this means a sequel is in the works!

B000005JA8|4.0|I was very interested in reading other people's reviews of this album by Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, because after forty years, I still haven't decided whether I really like it or not. Don't get me wrong, I have almost all of the albums put out by CB, but this one stands all alone out there, as it is just about one of the strangest albums ever made. All I can say is that if you are in the right mood to listen to it, it can be very entertaining, but at other times it just sounds annoying.  If the whole concept of art is to get an emotinal response from you, then this album hits a home run, 'casue you either love it or you hate it.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I really love Enya's Christmas cd.  It's unique in sound and very happy and soothing at the same time.  Everyone else is coming up with Christmas albums that feature the usual songs. Although Enya has the traditional \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" I like the way the chorus wells up in the song.  I also like the way they sang \\"Silent Night\\" in celt.  The gems are the lovely \\"Journey of the Angels\\" and \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\".  If you are adverse to listening to Christmas cds, then think of this as Enya's winter cd ... that takes into account that Christmas is celebrated at this time.
B000005RDY|4.0|Very few compilations deliver as well as this one but it's hardly a career-spanning epic, that said the ten songs featured, representing three albums from the mid seventies, clock up an amazing seventy minutes of raw, hard rock from a band sadly overlooked, under-rated and often ignored.    It must be stated that Budgie existed before Led Zep and around the same time as Cream but like many UK regional bands suffered the ignominy of London record companies.  Budgie, Taste and Stud all had similar experiences of low profile marketing and low budget recording deals.  The comparisons often levelled pale in light of this.    This album kick starts with \\"Breadfan\\" and maintains the momentum with \\"In The Grip of a Tyre-fitter's Hand\\".  It's enough to reel the listener in and apart from an attempt at a single, Andy Fairweather-Low's 'I Ain't No Mountain', the album offers some truly great moments in arguably Budgie's best period.  All ten minutes of 'Parents' and the epic 'Zoom Club' too, not to mention Napoleon Bona Parts I & II.  Shelly's vocals may be an aquired taste but they work in this framework along with some amazing guitar from Tony Bourge.  Drum duties are split between Ray Phillips and Pete Boot but I defy anyone to spot the difference.    Highly recommended especially to casual listeners, real fans would have all this material already.
B0009S4IKQ|5.0|After watching this show once on TV, I just had to watch it again.  The variety of personalities and their effect on one another is great.  The way our actions cause reactions in others is timeless, and this is a perfect example of that.
B000031XBQ|5.0|what can one say ... ABBA, even more than quarter of a century after their desolution, still be the best. i can't say if it is the original Swedish songs or the English or the spanish ones that's the best version, or even some of the tracks are available in French and German.<br />the thing with ABBA is that they have a track to accompany every mood that one be in. fast tracks, slow tracks, some when you in the mood, and some when you are down on your mood.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|It takes a while to sink in, but once it does you won't stop listening...over and over again....it's addictive and I know it sounds like cliches but it's true...you'll find layers of sounds and emotions, so raw and real and in your face it's sometimes discomforting, it's like all those feelings you've felt, that anger, that frustration, that joy and bliss put into music and words....beyond belief...really, give it a try.

0385340990|4.0|I picked up this book based on all the glowing reviews.  I guess I expected too much.<br /><br />It is a lovely book, and a refreshing read that doesn't involve a whole lot of bitter, bickering people.  The cast of characters is mostly pleasant.  The writing has a light touch, the series of letters is very reminiscent of 84 Charing Cross (which was a splendid book).  I love the amount of history in this book, the warmth of the Guernsey people, and I can feel the terror of the Nazi occupation.  In fact I feel really guilty just giving the book 4 stars, because there is so much about this book that someone can like.<br /><br />There is a little confusion -- is this historical fiction?  Romance?  Adventure?  It would make a great epic movie, because it falls into so many categories.  Which also makes it hard to get into.<br /><br />There are a lot of \\"what this book is about\\" reviews, so I'll skip to the reasons I didn't give it five starts. There are only two characters that I would want to know.  The rest, including the protagonist, Juliet, are pleasant, and a little bland.<br /><br />Almost at the end the book, Juliet's told by her editor and her dear friend to write about this fabulous character who has impacted everyone on Guernsey.  Maybe that's what I subconsciously didn't understand.  Why wasn't the protagonist this great character?  Why did Juliet have to intercede?<br /><br />I love the historical element to the book.  I can't wait to go to Guernsey.  And I do love the story.  I just was somewhat put off by the overly-sweet bits and the things I mentioned above.<br /><br />I still think it is a wonderful book that is enjoyable to read.  But I don't know that it's a book that I'll think about a lot.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Oncemore Alecia Moore has done it! Creating an album of this magnitude! Hats off. I thought Try this and I'm not dead were TOP albums, every song on this album makes it the next HUGE succes. No wonder all tickets to her concert here in Holland are sold out! Luckily I already saw her perform live twice already. This girl has a voice, power and spice that is unsurpassed lately by any other artist!<br />P!NK rocks! And don't forget the powerful ballads, awesome!<br /><br />Jack
B0013FSXT6|5.0|I feel that too much emphasis is placed on the Cruise and Kidman characters.  Their fears, desires, or any other emotions are really irrelevent to me.  They are cartoonish exagerations of the 21st century couple.  Does anyone really act that way?  Would any sane person tell their spouse they would walk out on their life together for a one night stand?  I don't think so.  Then  what is the point, why are we following these two people around as they behave as if they are in dream state, in a trance, or out of their minds?  The Venetian masked orgy is the key.  The movie tells us that parallel to our self medicated, dreamy, fretful, nuerotic, world, there is a world of power, harsh reality, and knowledge.  Sometimes we sitcom characters brush against this other world, with no good result.  Bill stumbled upont this other world and was crushed.  A hand of unmeasurable power and cruelty struck him down and held him immobile as one might a small dog.  The effect was sobering, but also short lived.  Bill, and we, will always cower and crawfish, walking backwards in homage away from the hideous strength, slipping back into our silly worlds of imagined infidelity, drugs, Christmans shopping, and whatever our ideal of sex is.  Eyes Wide Shut tells us that we are living a ridiculous, unnnatural existence, but perceive it as just the opposite.  When we are exposed to the powers that have dealt us this hand, to those who see us as ants on the sidewalk to be crushed, we have no other defense but to delve deeper into the illusion to escape a reality we can not accept.

B0002JJBZE|5.0|I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed the original series. And it looks much better here than it ever did on my parents' old VHS tapes. The images are surprisingly sharp, the colors vivid. The special effects are cheesy and low-budget, of course, but the acting and the stories transcend the execution. I'm glad I picked this up before they stopped producing them - I'm sure the remastered version looks great, but it wouldn't be the show I remember.

B000002GQE|5.0|I have been a fan of the Moody Blues since 1980-81, but their influence on me started in the mid 70s when I heard on the radio songs like `Nights in White Satin', `Question', `I'm Just a Singer in  a Rock `n' Roll Band', so in reality on a subconscious level I became a fan even before I knew it.<br /><br />Just to set the record straight, I first brought a compilation album to see if I'd like any other of their material, and as it turned out, I did, so then I started buying their records, now of course I've got them all except their `December' album.(at the time of writing this review) Anyway I can say without a doubt that `Days of Future Passed' their second album, (their first was `Magnificent Moodies' although some may argue that it isn't) is their best album that they have ever made and the most influential (`Days of Future Passed' is one of my personal top 10 favourite albums of all time).<br /><br />Anyway it all started when the Moody Blues were in debt still owing money with Decca Records but were offered a deal to make a rock and roll version of Antonin Dvorak's `New World Symphony' that would promote Deram Records (a subsidiary) new revolutionary sound Deramic Stereo Sound (DSS-Sounds really impressive...wow) this would cancel the group's debt, but the group were unable to complete the project.<br /><br />But all was not lost, the Moody Blues had an idea, they were able to get Peter Knight back who did the arranging and conducting Dvorak's orchestral interludes on the previous now abandoned project, plus all the material the band recorded for a new album concept, naturally the Deram executives were not impressed but went along for the ride, as they were just as curious to see how it would work...success!<br /><br />Days of Future Passed<br /><br />The album was released in 1967 and went to number 3 on the Billboard 200 and number 27 on the UK Albums chart. The single `Nights in White Satin' went to number 19 in the UK Singles chart in 1967 and again to number 9 in 1972, as well as number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the same year; another single `Tuesday Afternoon' also hit number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.<br /><br />`Days of Future Passed' is seen by many as the band's greatest achievement in music-in concept and in idea. It was totally unheard of and wild, considering the time/period-1960s. But out of persistence and since the Moody Blues had nothing to lose (they were broke) gave it one last push to revive their musical career, and it worked-even Deram Records couldn't believe it. The album was experimental, innovative, avant-garde, advanced in concept, totally beyond the classic 60s sound. It was a hallmark in musical history, a recording that even today still holds up on its own, if `Days of Future Passed' were a painting it would be worth millions; and having said that the cover art of the album is in itself brilliant, you need to see it to believe it. With this album the Moody Blues crossed genres and melded different forms of music that was thought impossible. (Like mixing oil and water)<br /><br />Okay let's now look at the songs from the album, which on the surface as a whole is about the day, but in my mind in reality it is about human life, our life, an interpretation about ourselves and how we live our lives on this earth.<br /><br />`The Day Begins'<br /><br />This is our birth as we enter the world; an excellent musical start to the album, uncomplicated easy on the ear, with sweeping soft soothing sounds and rhythms to awaken the senses with the added poem by Justin to prepare you for the next part on our life's journey.<br /><br />`Dawn is a Feeling'<br /><br />A surreal song with undertones of depression (the growing pains of life) that is not really obvious, but just listen to Justin's voice, which gives that impression. But as the song progresses, it slightly uplifts you as Justin's voice changes his tone to hopefully reveal a better feeling ahead (we are growing up fast in this world of uncertainty) with a musical break at the end to expose the light of the world, where all is not lost. (We stand on our two feet preparing ourselves for life's mishaps and what is to come)<br /><br />`Another Morning'<br /><br />We have awaken (the reality of life), this is an up tempo song that promises better things to come, life on the whole, has surprises for us awaiting to be discovered. This song is contrasted by the last as being positive while `Dawn is a Feeling' represents the negative, (night-negative, light-positive). We attempt to take control of our destiny as we seek perfection.<br /><br />`Peak Hour'<br /><br />We have reached mid-life in our journey, as we try to assess ourselves and our world, our thoughts, and what we need in our lives to fulfil what remains, the musical interlude represents our brain trying to comprehend what we have learned so far, our neurons travelling the byways of our thoughts piecing together to understand; this leads us to `Peak Hour' which is by contrast a hard-rock type song with great guitar sounds, hard, fast, confusing, the rush of adrenalin as we the human move forward trying to make sense of ourselves to prepare for our next instalment in our lives. The fast and the furious pace of life.<br /><br />`Tuesday Afternoon'<br /><br />With this song we pause and reflect what has gone before in our lives, the soft rhythmic melody almost puts us in a trance-like state (a throw back to the 60s psychedelic movement). We stand to ponder about ourselves, and where we are going, has our life been fulfilling? Has it been worth while? Questions are raised; voices invade your mind trying to help you understand, as you take that trip within your conscience and subconscious.<br /><br />`Evening Time to Get Away''<br /><br />With this song we go deeper into the meaning of life, we try to dissect the pieces (years) of ourselves; this is of course a darker song that reflects the title as we begin our descent towards death. But as we go forward, we go back, trying to turn around to reclaim our youth, we do not wish to face death, we are afraid. We try to run, as we do not want to recognise the inevitable.<br /><br />`The Sunset'<br /><br />The end is near, our life upon reflection is what it is, and we try to understand the bigger picture and our place in the universe. We still do not understand our eyes can not see clearly, the picture (life's meaning) is fading. The only eye we see is the sun (our third eye) as it makes its way beyond the horizon, beyond our sight-beyond our reach?<br /><br />`Twilight Time'<br /><br />Our life is over, we are dead, this song tells us about the journey we make after, (the afterlife) between the physical and the spiritual planes reaching for the stars and beyond, it is a mysterious journey of the unexpected, our soul confused, but assisted by the voice (direction) as we fly towards not only the question of life but perhaps the answer as well.<br /><br />`Nights in White Satin'<br /><br />Have we reached inner peace? As an individual we are confronted by the angels (nights) in their angelic attire (white satin) taking us by the hand on an endless journey, towards our possible next life, to begin again. But as we walk the path we see those that have gone before us, our friends, our family, our enemies, before we reach that doorway into the next world (experience). In this song we experience peace, love, and contentment with religious undertones. It is also possible that `Nights in White Satin' could even represent God in his or her many forms (nights) or even different aspects of ourselves.<br /><br />`Late Lament'<br /><br />The final thought spoken by our God, as we become part of the cosmic universe, telling us about the world, the life, the inner thoughts as a collective of human experience, our fears and our fantasies. In the end there is no end, but a beginning to begin again, have no fear as we walk towards the holy light (gong sound) to a better path in ourexistence (spiritual growth).<br /><br />Well how about that, this album has a different meaning for me than perhaps those who have already reviewed this album in a different light. This just goes to show that \\"Days of Future Passed\\" has different connotations and may not be obvious, which means you need to look deeper to find the true meaning of what the album is trying to express.<br /><br />In any case this album can mean many things to many people, but in the long run, just enjoy the ride as \\"Days of Future Passed\\" is a classic that will stand the test of time for years to come (and go).<br /><br />Special thanks to Wikipedia for additional information for compiling this review.ognise the inevitable.    `The Sunset'    The end is near, our life upon reflection is what it is, and we try to understand the bigger picture and our place in the universe.

0545128285|4.0|A great fan of Harry Potter and Rowlings, I was excitedly waiting for this. It was a super short read and left me feeling slightly disappointed. Most of the short stories had a nice story line and were well-written, but sometimes they felt a bit kiddish.  Now knowing that it is a children's book, and that Rowlings didn't even plan to publish it, and is forwarding the proceeds to charity- it is more than I could hope for. The thirst for more Harry Potter literature burns on and this is sort of an after-the-event teaser :) I encourage Harry Potter fans to read it because you probably can't rest till you do and you, like me, would enjoy whatever snippets you get. However if you're not that into Harry Potter or have never read it, I don't recommend Beedle the Bard.

031606792X|1.0|I loved, LOVED the first three books in this series.  But this one was a travesty to the \\"Twilight\\" brand.  I know others have given away the key parts of the plot and I wouldn't dare.  Suffice it to say that although the other books in this series were a little farfetched, they were at least a good read.  I'm sooooo \\"Team Edward\\", I've got the t-shirt, I was totally addicted to \\"vamp love.\\"  I couldn't read the others fast enough, but I couldn't finish this one fast enough to stop the torture.<br /><br />Bottom line: if I could persuade Stephanie Meyer to erase this book and try again I would.  Pray that it's over.
1423101464|5.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth is the fourth book after Titan's Curse in Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  It is all about the Olympian Gods being alive and well in the twenty-first century.  The main character, Percy Jackson, named after the great Greek hero, Persius, goes into the labyrinth built by Daedalus, the great Greek inventor.   He is sent on a quest to find out where his enemy is in the great maze.  He comes out alive after a macabre chain of events.  The Battle of the Labyrinth is awesome because of the action, the connections with Greek mythology, and it's a great follow-up to Titan's Curse.    The Battle of the Labyrinth is all about Percy's fights with Greek monsters.  The first battle that Percy has is with two empousai.  Two empousai, or vampires, dressed as high school cheerleaders attack Percy and his new friend, Rachel Elizabeth Dare.  He kills one of them with his sword anaklusmos, or otherwise know as riptide, but the other vampire escapes.  The next battle is with a sphinx, but, instead of a riddle, Annabeth has to answer game show questions.  Percy's friend, Annabeth, the daughter of Athena, is insulted by how stupid the Sphinx's questions are and says, \\"I'm the child of Athena and this is an insult to my intelligence.  I won't answer these questions.\\"   The Sphinx goes after her.   Percy and his brother, Tyson, who is a Cyclops, kill the sphinx and saved Annabeth.  The third best battle in the book is Percy's battle with a son of Nemesis.  They fight for hours until Percy finally escapes.  These are the best battles I can tell you about.  To find out the best read about the best battles, you'll have to read the book yourself.     Percy Jackson and the Olympian books have many connections with Greek mythology but Battle of the Labyrinth has the most. Percy and his friend are trapped in the labyrinth, the great holding place of the minotaur.  The same place where Theseus killed the Minotaur many, many years ago.  Percy even meets Daedalus,the great Greek inventor who made the labyrinth.  Daedalus doesn't even look that old.  Percy is the son of Poseidon.  It is interesting that Riordan didn't choose Zeus as his father.  The reason is because he didn't want Percy to be too powerful.  If Percy were the son of Zeus then he wouldn't want to strive to more greatness because he would already be the best.      The Battle of the Labyrinth is a good follow up to Titan's Curse.  It answers many of the   questions of Titan's Curse.    For example, it answered that Nico di Angeleo is still alive.  The characters from Titan's Curse were really great and Riordan didn't kill any of them in Battle of the Labyrinth.  Also, in Battle of the Labyrinth, Annabeth plays a much bigger role.  This is good because she is a most interesting character.  She acts like she knows everything and is always blurting out facts. She is Percy's best friend and long with Grover a satyr. He is scared of everything. Rick Riordan said he is his favorite character to write about because Grover is scared anything and everything. He is the comic relief for    At the end of The Battle of the Labyrinth Riordan leaves the reader hanging for The Last Olympian.  Nico tells Percy how to kill the enemy of the story, Luke.  Also, I want to know if Riordan kills off any of the main characters. READ THIS BOOK! It is the best book you will ever read.  I promise you will be satisfied with this book.  Score:10/10 of course I love this book
B000002L99|5.0|This album was the beginning of the best American rock band to ever walk the earth.  Sammy Hagar replacing David Lee Roth was perfect for us fans who loved the band, but never really cared for DLR.  Sammy Hagar opens this fantastic album with his now trademark \\"Helloooo Baby!\\" and from there you are welcomed back to the party with a more sophisticated Van Halen.    This album was really an extension of the 1984 masterpiece cleverly titled 1984.  Keyboards were now the norm in Van Halen and they used them beautifully on this release.  Songs like Why Can't This Be Love, Dreams, and Love Walks In show EVH not only as a guitar god, but something much more important, a great songwriter.    The rockers here are some of the band's best as Best Of Both Worlds, Summer Nights, and the album titled track 5150 are all AMAZING.    Dont let the DLR fans fool you, this and all the Van Hagar albums didnt go straight to #1 because they sucked.
031606792X|5.0|It breaks my heart to see so many people slander Meyer's Fourth book. I felt that she wrapped up the story nicely. Many saga's often leave the reader wanted to know more, almost saddened by how the story ends. But this was not the case with \\"Breaking Dawn\\". When I finished the story I was pleasantly surprised at how content I was with how the characters were left.   The story played out nicely and she stayed true to the characters. What more can you ask for?
B00004TS0E|5.0|I bought this movie the day it came out on VHS, and my family has watched it every year before Christmas. We also watch the original film for old times sake, but Mara Wilson, the little girl, melts my heart with her performance! The actors are incredible, and my Christmas would not be complete without being able to see this movie! This version of the story stays very well with the original, but reserves just enough updating to make it believable! You will NOT be disapointed with this movie!

0307265730|5.0|In UNACCUSTOMED EARTH, Jhumpa Lahiri continues to impress with her clear-eyed attention to the smallest details of human conflicts. In these emotionally resonant short stories, she presents a diverse assembly of complex, sympathetic, three-dimensional characters. Several reader-reviewers have criticized Lahiri for focusing on Ivy League-educated, upper-middle-class Bengalis - these reviewers should realize that academic success and financial well-being are common among immigrant Bengalis in the U.S. What is remarkable to me is how authentically wide-ranging the characters' experiences are, despite their common roots and status. It is the author's perspicacity and meticulous crafting which make the prose in these stories appear simple and fluid.

0312360266|2.0|This book is not for middle school aged kids!      The only positive is that the storyline is original and fun, I began to be interested in the outcomes and care for the [one dimensional] sidekicks.    However, the writing is so much of a desperate attempt to sound teen-girl-language savvy that it's distracting.      More mature content includes reference to oral sex & multiple swear words on every page.
B00140PK6O|5.0|My husband and I absolutely loved Cranford.The costuming was magnificent.The characters came alive. We laughed ,we cried and the ending was very satisfying.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Finally, at long last, we get a superhero movie that lives up to the dynamism and creative vigor of the original comicbook medium!  This second installment in the rebooted \\"Batman\\" franchise is easily the best Batman movie yet, with an intelligent, surprising, suspenseful script, a fluid sense of action, and vastly superior acting.<br /><br />The first glimmer of how much this film (and its director) really \\"get it\\" comes early on, when we see that Maggie (oh, god, yes!!) Gyllenhaal has been cast to replace Katie (please make it stop!!) Holmes in the role of district attorney Rachel Dawes. Similarly, Aaron Eckhart brings just the right tone to his performance as the public crusader Harvey Dent, and Gary Oldman has completely nailed Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (as the character has evolved in recent years, particularly in the late series, \\"Gotham Central.\\") And, of course, Heath Ledger is absolutely stunning as the Joker. What a cruel tragedy that he is dead and can no longer excel in this role: he lights up the screen and makes it crackle with terror every second he's on screen. He, and this film's version of Two-Face, are the first Hollywood supervillains -- ever -- that actually feel feel terrifying and real. Director Christopher Nolan is in no small part responsible for this amazing success, and although he's been handicapped by losing a star (and by plot choices described below) I have no doubt that he will continue to breathe vitality and life into this genre: this guy is the future of comicbook movies. Warner, please keep him happy.<br /><br />SPOILER-LAND:<br />---------------<br />As thrilling as I found this film, I was disheartened to find that the end (really just the last five minutes) fell flat, and in particular that it fell into one of the major faults that has plagued many other Hollywood comicbook adaptations. The decision to kill Two-Face at the end of the film was a mistake. The same mistake was made in the first Batman film (with the Joker apparently killed at the end) and has been replicated in several subsequent films.  I honestly don't know why the studios seem to feel that audiences need this kind of blunt closure in these films, or why they assume that every super-film has to be so big and grandiose, and have such a decisive finality at the end. Killing these characters doesn't make sense: it unnecessarily hamstrings future scriptwriters, and it doesn't give audiences what they want. We **don't want** to see a great, creepy character like Two-Face die -- we want to see him again, in the next film, and we want to see Eckhart reprise his role! It's not necessary to kill the villains -- just throw them in jail, let them break out later, and cause lots of mayhem.  Also, Dent's death is used as a dramatic pretext to put Batman \\"on the lam\\" at the end... Like the decision to kill the Two-Face character, Batman's melodramatic response rings false and was a big misstep on the part of the studios -- it just feels dramatically forced and doesn't add anything to the overall direction of the franchise that wasn't there already, with Batman being a costumed vigilante, etc.<br /><br />It's my belief that too much pressure is being placed on creative teams to make these films overly-epic, when really comicbook stories are plenty exciting on their own, and don't need the added layers of mythologizing and grandiosity. What's great about this film is that, until the lame ending, it almost entirely avoided the top-heavy pretentiousness and leaden storytelling of previous super-films. It's my hope that the studios will learn from this success, and loosen up a little bit. When they learn to tell these stories with the same sort of prolific abandon as the comicbook companies themselves -- when making super-movies becomes more normal and more routine -- then perhaps they can just settle down and deliver some spectacular pyrotechnics and dynamic, mind-blowing action and leave the clunky exposition and too-all-encompassingstory arcs behind. Really, we just want to see the super-dudes battle it out. And we want it to be fun. This film delivers on all fronts.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Wanted is a well thought out, action-packed thriller that centers around Wesley Gibson, a young man whose life is on a course parallel to that of a Charlie Brown storyline. He holds a corporate dead-end job with a boss who does not respect him and has a girlfriend who has been cheating with, of all people, his very best friend. Adding to his troubles are what he perceives to be a continual series of anxiety attacks that he tries to treat with prescribed medications; little does he know that these physical states that he has been trying to treat are actually rare, genetic gifts passed down from his father who abandoned him when he was an infant. What were thought to be handicaps that would induce psychotic states that might affect his performance on the job and in life are to be discovered as superhuman, albeit mutant, characteristics once Wesley encounters the lovely Fox, an assassin who holds the secret to the fate of Wesley's father as well as that of Wesley himself.    Upon meeting Fox, Wesley is taken to a textile factory, which is a front for an underground, vigilante network known as The Fraternity. Leading this secret society is an elder named Sloan, who tells Wesley that his destiny is with The Fraternity and that his soon-to-be cohorts, including Fox, all share the aforementioned physiological traits compatible for the perfect assassin.     Who is to be assassinated? Only the stitching in the woven cloth holds the key, and Sloan is the one who translates and interprets what is to be revealed and carried out. Supposedly, Sloan is the intellectual heir, a Grand Pooh Bah if you will, of the wisdom of the prophetic practices of The Fraternity that have been handed down for over a millennium.    Wesley, through this group, learns more about the purpose of his existence and why his father left him. Or does he? Surprising twists and turns await Wesley, whose identity, upon a sudden moment's notice, has essentially undergone a metamorphosis from George Costanza toJason Bourne, the latter of which has been searching for his true identity.    In all, a great movie played out by the star-studded cast, including the superb James McAvoy, the alluring Angelina Jolie, and the indomitable Morgan Freeman.

B000P0J0DI|4.0|\\"Unforgiven\\" is one of the many entries into THE American film genre. According to Clint Eastwood, the film's star and director, it \\"summarizes everything I feel about the western.\\" And it is a fine western film, filled with fascinating characters, exciting gunfights, and beautiful choreography. The story itself is fascinating, though it is a bit slow and uneven in some places.<br />Clint Eastwood gives what is arguably his best performance as Bill Munny, a former gunslinger and cold-blooded killer, who's changed his ways, but agrees to collect one more bounty in order to support his two children. We see how violence can corrupt a human being, and how past demons can truly eat at him, and Eastwood plays this perfectly. Morgan Freeman, one of my all-time favorites, gives another terrific performance as Ned Logan, Munny's old partner. Gene Hackman is brutal, but also scarily likable, as the villainous Little Bill Daggett, the corrupt sheriff of the town. It isn't hard to see why he won an Oscar for his performance. The rest of the cast turn in solid performances as well, and help to keep the story both interesting and involving.<br />Overall, \\"Unforgiven\\" is a fine, if slow and uneven, entry into the genre with great performances and well-done gunfights. Fans of western and drama alike will find much to enjoy in this modern-day western.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+

B000N6U0E2|4.0|I don't quite get amazon.com's review of this movie stating it's a \\"heartwarming film that demonstrates how good, hard-working people can become homeless almost overnight.\\" The film to me was about the complete opposite. Am I missing something here? The film is about how hardworking people can make their dreams come true if they stick with it through hard times. I suppose those brainwashed with marxist anti-Americanism will see this film as proof that American society makes us all homeless and starving to death; while the rest of us will see it as a testement that hard work can get you to places you never thought possible. Will Smith is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He's real in almost everything he does. You trust that he feels for the characters he plays; there is no exception to this film. Some of the story was disjointed, but it was fast paced nonetheless. It was one of the few films made recently where you can actually cheer for the protagonist. I reccommend this film. I wish Hollywood made more films like this.
B00004TKAQ|5.0|As has been said before... The sound of this is absolutely wonderful! If you compare the poor Capitol release with this  Repertoire re-master, most people will right away notice more depth and clarity in the sound.     I actually believe Capitol mastered their version from an LP, as there are a few times you can noticeably hear some snap, crackle, pops that aren't anyway to be found on this version.    Performance wise... One of the best Live and Magical recordings you'll ever hear from this era (PERIOD.)    Don't miss this one if you love that era of psychedelic music & are a bit of audiophile! I truly don't believe that it gets much better than this in sound & performance (and I have a ton of great rare live shows from this era.)    Buy & Enjoy Kiddies!!!    btw...

I was looking for something similar and came upon this great series and I'm sooooo happy that I did.<br /><br />One of the things that I had a little bit of a problem with at first was keeping up with all of the characters, there are a ton of them.  But the epic story telling grabbed a hold of me and I was hooked.  It's been a long time since I began to read a book and got completely lost in it.  I hope that HBO's mini series lives up to these wonderful books.  Completely recommend the books.

B001GZ6QEC|2.0|The film is photographed sublimely and Heath Ledger's performance is great but I'm disappointed in the lack of extras. There is not a single commentary track and only limited behind the scenes footage and information. There are two 45 minute worthless documentaries on Batman's technology and psychology which play like promo pieces rather than substantial extras, and then there are some pop up 'making of' extras that you can activate to watch during the film or separately. But each clip is only a few minutes so there is actually very little 'making of' or behind the scenes features at all.
158234082X|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is sort of a cynical character and portrays this dark, drug infested culinary life.  I think he is a little jaded and not all kitchens are like the ones he worked in.  Some are though.  It was a good read (not for young readers due to language/adult references) and held my interest to the end.  As a new professional chef, it gives you a bit of a reality check and some good advice for succeeding in the field.  As with anything, though, take it with a grain of salt.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|The film is excellent, no mistake about that.  But the bluray dvd is a piece of crap.  - No True HD sound as advertised, just wouldn't work. only Dolby Digital available.  - Menu's are counterintuitive and/or inoperable (\\"sorry you cannot do that with this disc at this time\\").  - Player totally hangs playing the extras, have to use the big red switch to get it back to life again.    Obviously there is no shortage of offending FBI WARNINGs accusing you of being a potential pirate before even beginning the movie. Where have these guys learned there manners???    Do I need to mention that the BD-live bit did nothing?    The \\"digital copy\\" appears to be only available if you're in the US. Frankly I was offended to such a degree by this time that I did not even bother to try it.    WAKE UP CALL: THIS IS 2008, THE GLOBAL MARKET PLACE, THERE REALLY REALLY ARE FOLKS LIVING OUTSIDE THE US, AND THEY ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS TOO!!!!    A very poor arrogant and short-sighted misproduction of what could have been a wonderful customer experience.    I am very very very disappointed with this display of incompetence.

B0015DWLD0|5.0|I've yet to read a summary of this book that really does it justice.  The New Yorker review made a valiant effort, but its a bit dishonest to describe this as a story of a good hardworking boy turning into a violent killer.  Everyone in the narrator's life is seen at a psychological remove.  He is disgusted by them, or pities them, or is generally indifferent to them.  He is entirely a product of his surroundings and upbringing, but he also comes to see the cages and disparities of India.    It may be fair to say the message is heavyhanded, but it is not so heavy handed that it is easily dismissed.  I felt uncomfortable at times - such as the section of the book where they are going to make him take the blame for killing a child that his mistress ran over and his family rejoicing that he can provide such a service.  Also the immense network of bribery and election manipulation.  Does every country have problems? Sure. The difference between \\"every country\\" and Balram's India is the depth and breadth of both the problems themselves, and the coverup and blind eyes turned by those in power.

B00000DHR0|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work.  This album is worth buying if only for one song - O Holy Night.  I have listened to this song over and over again since she came out with this album in 1998.  It's about 10 years now, and I am still deeply moved each and every time that I hear it.  I even listen to it outside of the Christmas season.  Truly the best rendition of this song ever performed... and it may never be topped.  Ave Maria is another song that she sings with extreme emotion... and another one that makes me want to weep like an old Italian man at the opera.  Well done.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|McCartney's previous five albums (Flaming Pie, Run Devil Run, Driving Rain, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, and Memory Almost Full) were all exceptional in very different ways. Though I tend to prefer Flaming Pie, Memory Almost Full, and possibly Run Devil Run, Electric Arguments rates close to those albums in overall quality, but is far more visceral while sacrificing little in terms of melody. While the first track, \\"Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight\\", is a nasty screamer, the rest of the album presents some awesome melodic rockers, mixed with some beautiful ballads, and some dreamy musical textures. The best tracks are the gorgeous \\"Dance 'Til We're High\\", the U2-like rocker \\"Sing the Changes\\", the driving rocker \\"Highway\\", and the gospel-like, folksy \\"Light From Your Lighthouse\\", although others may surface as favorites depending on mood. Another great one - one of McCartney's best.

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|Having rebooted the Batman franchise with a new backstory and aesthetic in \\"Batman Begins\\", director and co-writer Christopher Nolan gives us an allegory of a world desperate to overcome chaos and restore order and justice in \\"The Dark Knight\\". Gotham City is at the mercy of mobsters, its criminal justice system inadequate to deal with the scope of the corruption, when a new menace comes along: The Joker (Heath Ledger) is an extravagant sociopath and self-described \\"agent of chaos\\". Crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) cracks down on organized crime, and the crime bosses turn naively to The Joker to save them and kill Batman (Christian Bale). But The Joker cares nothing for money; he only cares for chaos.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is thematically ambitious but not quite successful. The Joker is a character without motive, which makes him a two-dimensional villain. His role is purely to represent the chaos that everyone, even the criminals, fears: random violence, theft, and destruction, without any root in any recognizable value system. Batman, police Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and D.A. Harvey Dent grapple with decisions about how far they should go to stop The Joker. At what cost order? Batman is a vigilante free to abandon his self-imposed codes of behavior if he chooses. Dent could let someone else do the dirty work and remain unscathed. These are relevant issues in today's world, but the film handles them with more convolution than complexity.<br /><br />It smartly recognizes that modern people fear unpredictability more than anything. But as for what values people should be willing to throw out the window to restore order, or to give the appearance of stability, well, the characters change their minds a lot, and so does the film. At 2 1/2 hours, it's much too long. It should lose some of the talkiness. The Joker suffers from being simply a thematic device. I found him unpleasant to watch until his havoc-wreaking became perversely charming. At least he looks like he's having fun. Batman's efforts to disguise his voice are distracting, and one action sequence in a building under construction is completely incoherent. An entertaining film, but Christopher Nolan needs to tighten it up and get more disciplined with his camera and his script.charming. At least he looks like he's having fun.

B00005JPO1|4.0|I actually enjoyed watching this movie, despite all the negative feedback it's had. I think if you like all of the other 3 movies you'll enjoy this as long as you keep an open mind.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Critics have been savaging this movie saying that it is not as good as Casino Royale and it is a disappointing sequel to the last movie. However, if you take a closer look, it is not really that bad as you have to understand the psychology of Bond changed in this one because revenge is high on his agenda.<br /><br />Yeah he lost his cool and he didn't sleep with as many women as he used to but that doesn't mean he is less competent. Instead he is willing to risk it all out to go for the target, and maybe behaving irrationally sort of spoiled a lot of people's idea of Bond but then it gives Bond a humane edge to the character, which I think is pretty good.<br /><br />It has a lot more actions than love and blah, which I definitely enjoyed more as I do think the whole love story in Casino Royale did drag the movie a bit half way through. So I am quite happy to see that there is a more action packed Bond in the cinema.<br /><br />Performance wise, Daniel doesn't really have a lot to do. It seems to mean that anger is the only expression he shows. Even when he acts cool the anger is still there and you can only see expression 6, 8 and 9 all the time, which makes the character a bit too 2-dimensional. That could be the reason a lot of people said they didn't like this one. Other characters were just there to support Bond so there are really not much to talk about and act on. Judi Dench is great though. It needs a great actor to be able to bring a supporting character so much in life that watching her doing her stuff on the screen was just such a pleasure. She is really in a league of her own in the movie.<br /><br />The new Bond girl was just so so but it is good to have one that carries her own agenda instead of just sleeping with Bond and waited to be saved. But the similarity with Bond was that the anger part that make her less charismatic. Maybe this is why she could work together with Bond in this mission.<br /><br />In all, if you want a good night out for an action packed movie, Quantum of Solace won't disappoint. But do not go into the cinema to look for something Casino Royale alike simply the story continues. Otherwise you are bound to be disappointed.'t disappoint.

B001F12J48|1.0|I just bought the 3-D version of The Polar Express today because my whole family loves this movie, especially my 5-year-old. As it turns out, it was a total waste of money since we already have a copy of the original movie. The 3-D simply did not work. When we put the glasses on the picture was still almost as fuzzy as it is without the glasses. It is still better to watch it WITH the glasses than without...IF you press them really tight up against your face, but that's about as good as it gets! My husband wears glasses and it was even worse for him. We gave up and watched the regular version. What a dissapointment! The box cover is really cool though. Sadly, it was more fun to watch than the movie!

B001GZ6QEC|2.0|Yes, I waited awhile to see this film and am glad I did. A person can be engulfed by hype because of a particular fondness for a charactor. All the ravers of this film are blinded. They idolize the spectacle before them because they want it to succeed. It is true, Batman Begins was a good movie. The Dark Knight does not equal or  match it, and it should.          As I sat through this movie I noticed a strong resemblence to the 1989 film Batman with Michael Keaton. The staged feel of an already fake press, the marauding comic-like villians who fall on cue, the numerous subplots of Gothams crime bosses and alot of long, empty dialogue. Thats not to say theirs absolutely no good parts. Like in Batman 1989 some scenes really did shine. Jack Nicolsons Joker was pretty good with his, \\"Wait'll they get a load of me\\" stuff. And I harken back to that 1989 Joker who hung from a high perch and laughed while battling Batman. Was that same depiction in the Dark Knight?                         The Harvey Dent charactor was strained and boring. I couldnt believe how many times his name was uttered. What made it worse was that I could care less about his role. The nail in the coffin was Rachaels replacement. This woman was very unattractive in comparison to Katie Holmes(most guys agree)and drew zero empathy from me. The action scenes dissapointed on most levels. Sure, alot of swishes and booms took place but they were not cohesive. They were only there to fill the explosion quota. A good half of this film could have been removed to kill the dullness factor. I'm all for long substanative words but that element was missing. Scene jumping without relevance was another squasher.     Ledger did put a worthwhile, unique spin on the Joker. I yearned for more of his charm. He did the same thing Nicholson did as it applies to outdoing everyone else. Its hard on a film when a superior actor alone carries it. This again is where it emulated Batman 1989. Ledgers excellent scenes are the onlyones worth reviewing on the dvd and if your honest you'll admit it. Who's gonna play back Commissioner Gordons longwinded banter with anyone?   Batman Begins had heartfelt quality dialogue that expounded on the personas of each the way a comicbook couldn't. I've seen some write that they have watched the Dark Knight over and over again. Something is wrong there. Only parts of this film can be watched over again and thats it. With all its shame, drudgery and forced hype it can only be left to you the viewer if we really want to continue down the road of regurgitating a 1989 Batman for this franchise. Actually, forget about our control over this. When we hear, \\"Enter the Riddler\\" the lines will form again.
B001H9MWW2|5.0|i have long been a coldplay fan. So you could say i'm biased. Recently, i have stopped listening to them so much; finding myself more in the indie scene. I usually buy coldplay's albums simply because i just want ALL their music. I want everything they've ever produced. So this album was no different. Or so i thought.    The EP disc of this album is simply amazing. Listen to the entirety of Viva La Vida first. Get to know those songs, then listen to Prospekt's March. It is simply amazing and i love the tweaks they made.    awesome deal.
0142000655|5.0|If the phrase \\"Great American Novel\\" implies a work of scope and substance, dealing with what is unique in American life, rooted in a deep knowledge of time and place, filled with characters who might well be our own forefathers, and infused with a strong moral purpose, EAST OF EDEN certainly fills the bill. At 600 pages, it is a much longer book than [[ASIN:0142000671 OF MICE AND MEN]] (103 pages) or even [[ASIN:0142000663 THE GRAPES OF WRATH]] (416), but it is filled with all kinds of light: the bright simplicity of Steinbeck's language, the spark of his humor, his shining song of the land, and the rich glow that comes from his deep understanding of human beings, especially imperfect ones.<br /><br />Steinbeck himself appears in the novel as a young boy, and one of the threads in the story is the tale of his maternal grandfather, Samuel Hamilton, who emigrated from Northern Ireland in the middle of the 19th century and came to the Salinas Valley in California. There he raised a large family more on the proceeds of his work as a well-driller and handyman than through much success on his hardscrabble farm. The stories of Steinbeck's older relatives are scattered through the book as a touchstone of basic American values of faith, hard work, and the capacity to dream. One becomes rich when the automobile comes to Salinas, another dies in poverty, but most simply marry and raise families of their own.<br /><br />But the central character in the book is a New Englander, Adam Trask. We see him as a boy, in a complex relationship with his half-brother Charles. Sent by his father, a Civil War veteran, into the army, he knocks around the country for years before unexpectedly coming into some money and settling in the Salinas Valley. The main part of the book follows the growth of Adam's sons Caleb and Aron to young adulthood, and it is clear that some of the old history of Charles and Adam is being repeated. Or of Cain and Abel. For that oldest of all stories about colonists in a new land -- farmer, hunter, man of action, man of dreams -- obviously has great resonance for Steinbeck. It becomes a symbol for American aspiration and American violence, a paradox of how two members of a family can be so alike and yet so different, and a challenge that goes to the heart of individual morality.<br /><br />Steinbeck had used such resonances before, most notably in the final scene of THE GRAPES OF WRATH, but here he is constructing an entire novel around the exegesis of a biblical text. Some of his scaffolding is a little obvious, notably the prevalence of names beginning with A or C, and the numerous philosophical discussions. There is a serpent in this Eden, Cathy Ames, one of the great female psychopaths in literature, whom Steinbeck announces as a monster even before her birth. Goodness is represented first by Samuel Hamilton, and later by Adam's Chinese servant, Lee. But for all this polarization, Steinbeck's writing is so grounded in realism, and his treatment of good and evil so nuanced, that it is no longer a matter of how the old story repeats itself, but of how flawed human beings may claw back from the brink and be the masters of their own souls. This is a book to make you think -- but also one to make you laugh and cry, and above all to glory in this wondrous country and its people.-- farmer, hunter, man of action, man of dreams -- obviously has great resonance for Steinbeck.

0375424474|5.0|This is a genuinely remarkable book.  The author combines his expertise in paleontology and anatomy with his true gift for clear, stylish writing to produce the best book about the evolution of humans that you're likely to find.  The book traces all of our major \\"subsystems\\"-- hearing, vision, skeletal form, internal organs, skin, etc.-- back as far as possible, sometimes to the single-celled creatures who appeared at the beginning of life on earth.  At the same time, he describes the latest research into DNA, which supports all of the paleontological evidence he details.<br /><br />His point is that only by \\"embracing our inner fish\\" can we understand our place in the elaborate fabric of life.  There is nothing at all random about evolution; everything has an origin somewhere and will no doubt be the predecessor of some later development.  He writes strictly from a scientific point of view.  You will find not a word about the current evolution vs. intelligent design controversy.<br /><br />As I read, I was increasingly impressed by the author's economical style.  That is, he is so clear and precise that he can very thoroughly discuss millions of years of evolutionary developments in just 200 pages, doing so comprehensively enough that nothing important is left out.  Finally, his style makes the book just plain fun to read.  There are not many authors who can do all of those things simultaneously.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I recommend it most highly.

0385340990|3.0|There was so much hype around this book that I could not wait to start it.  At first, I was surprised that it was a series of letters, and not in a conventional format, but I figured that I would get over it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I tend to read mostly on the train, in half-hour increments, and rarely sit down for a good long read, unless I am truly in love with the book.  As a result of this, possibly, I never truly warmed up to the characters, and had a lot of trouble keeping many of them straight.  The book never grabbed hold of me and drew me in, as I was hoping.  I think the format was the problem.<br /><br />The writing was excellent, and there were portions that were incredibly poignant and emotionally-charged, but those seemed to be few and far between.  I never got to a point where I couldn't wait to see what happened next, and, for me, that is the mark of an unsuccessful book.

0956010903|5.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Collector's Edition is a sensual pleasure.<br /><br />I make daguerreotypes in small leather cases.  My customers appreciate the tactility and the personal, even perhaps carnal pleasure they receive when holding the case in their hand.  I was pleased to feel the same joy in opening this CE book.<br /><br />The textures are lovely but not savory.  The book's container has a nice simulated leather.  Opening the container reveals a perfectly sumptuous black velvet interior. On the right is a sachet containing the book with Ms. Rowling's name sewn into it.  On the right is an attractive pocket containing the limited edition prints.<br /><br />Amazon.com's Beedle the Bard is excactly what the world needs more of.  The book became a treasure immediately... anyone can have that lousy trade book in the stores but this is truly something to be cherished.<br /><br />Regarding the editions, my plastic wrapper had the number (161442) on it so I don't think that the editions are limited to 100,000 as indicated in the photographs.<br /><br />Job well done!<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I noticed that the white paper \\"This Side Up\\" slip cover was torn.  This gives me the impression that Amazon.com's fulfillment center doesn't really give a crap.  The packaging was the typical brown Amazon.com box with two of those air bubble things.  Insufficient.
0517548232|5.0|Economics in one lesson is particularly cogent for today, Dec. 2008, with the backdrop of the financial catastrophe hitting the United States as well as other parts of the world. Hazlitt doesn't pull any punches in denouncing government intervention in the market and in denouncing those who believe the immoral philosophy of \\"stealing the fruit of Peter's labor and delivering it to Paul.\\" I would go so far as to say that Hazlitt more of less supports my long held belief that Regulated Freedom is Oxymoronic. I have no doubt Hazlitt would have supported \\"ORO's\\" (GoldDigest) distillation of Robert Triffin's Economics with his statement of Triffin's Dilemma:  \\"Industry is Destroyed at the Source of Money Creation.\\" Hazlitt wrote the truth about economic reality which is why his book will always be applicable. Hazlitt doesn't say it in this book but I believe he would have agreeed that a system of fiat currency or debt money is a lootocracy and cannot come to a good end.  I am indebted to Hazlitt for this excellent message of truth.
B000UH8HQ2|3.0|Let me start by saying I am a really big Glenn Gould fan. I listen to his Bach on a daily basis. His Bach is usually extremely convincing, despite some extreme tempi.     When Gould plays music other then Bach, there can be problems...and sometimes revelations. For example, some of his Beethoven-recordings are very satisfying, and I really love his Haydn sonatas ([[ASIN:B0000028NR Haydn: Piano Sonatas, Hob. XVI, Nos. 42, 48-52]]) .    This recording of Beethoven late sonatas falls, in my opinion, in the category \\"problems\\". Gould totally ignores Beethoven's indications, his tempi are totally mad and his articulation is totally weird. Even this would not really be a problem if it all led to a convincing, albeit idiosyncratic, reading of these wonderful sonatas. But unfortunately this is not the case.    If you love Beethoven, I would not recommend this cd. If you're Glenn Gould fan, I would look elsewhere in his extensive catalogue for better versions of these sonatas.
0375826726|1.0|I was quite anxious to read the 3rd book in the Trilogy, now a cycle, to see how Eragon would be able to conquer Galbatorix.  Perhaps the writer has not figured out how and needed to needlessly stretch out this third book.  It was extremely boring in parts almost as if the writer could not come to finish the tale.      Editors, take note, do your job and tightly edit the 4th book so we do not have to read another 700 pages.    Readers, you could just as easily skip the 3rd book, read some of the reviews and wait for the last (I hope) in the cycle.

6305696071|5.0|ok,i'll take it from the top. 1.)as soon as edward pulled up vivian's friend knew that she had the better class and confidence to deal with a high profile client.vivian did not beg  for   his services nor did she offer...which made her very mysterious to edward therefore he pursuied the hooker not vice versa. 3.) vivian offered edward something so seductive....a playful stress free life,something he had never had because of the seriousness of his work. vivian made edward get in touch with his playful side (exploring prostitution) not being afraid of heights,taking the day off and having a conscience when dealing with his clients....before the talk with vivian edward was cut throat.    this is not a fairytale but real life seduction.this is the way that a woman capitavates a man's heart,by not being pushy,dominating or passive.vivian was innocent,childlike and very sensual....this turned heads where ever she went wheter she was dressed like a hoochie or a socialite.    vivian had morals and dignity about herself which was irrestable to a millionaire who gets everything he wants when he wants.for him to be with vivian he had to pay a price.....a price to have fun and explore his inhabitions that have been bottled up coming from a family of high expectations......this is a must see movie,this is not a cinderalla story,but a game plan for woman who have been using their charms for thousands of years by seducing men to get the love they want.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Vampire movies tend to come in two flavours -- either they're gory bloodsucker actionfests, or celebrations of goth hotties tortured by their immortality.<br /><br />But \\"Let The Right One In\\" is neither kind or story. Instead this haunting, atmospheric Swedish movie is a poignant look at a very unique friendship between a young boy and a vampire child. Brilliant acting and a sort of pale, ghostly directorial style make this a vivid experience, but the brilliance is in the story itself.<br /><br />One winter night, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) sees a car drop off his two new neighbors. He doesn't pay much attention at first, since he's always either ignored or bullied.<br /><br />But as he vents his frustrations by stabbing a tree, he sees the ghostly, rumpled Eli (Lina Leandersson), who informs him, \\"Just so you know, I can't be your friend.\\" She turns out to be as much of an oddball as Oskar -- especially since she only ventures out at night, smells a bit funny, and is unaffected by the winter cold. But despite her odd greeting, the two strike up a friendship.<br /><br />At the same time, a series of brutal murders are taking place all around town -- and it's no great shock that Eli's companion Hakan (Per Ragnar) is harvesting blood for Eli. Being no idiot, Oskar realizes that Eli is a bona fide vampire, and doesn't intend to let that get in the way of their puppy love. Yet when Hakan's errands go horribly awry, Oskar finds himself to be the only person Eli can rely on.<br /><br />It's no great exaggeration to say that \\"Let the Right One In\\" is undoubtedly the best vampire movie made in many years. While the movie has plenty of more violent moments and a snowy backdrop, director Tomas Alfredson is far more focused on the sweet, eerie relationship between two lonely, otherworldly young children. And actually, one of them is young in appearance only.<br /><br />Alfredson paints the movie in white, scarlet and black -- pale, wintry light and snow that covers the world, occasional splatters of blood and deep shadows that seem to swallow everything up. And he handles the entire storyline gracefully. Every part of the movie has the same matter-of-fact, unflinching treatment, including the nastier parts -- such as a gruesome blood-harvesting murder by Hakan, or when Eli attempts to enter a house without being invited. Trust me, it's bad.<br /><br />The most loving attention is devoted to the children's friendship, which manages to be as strange and beautiful as a rare dragonfly. Their nighttime meetings almost have the quality of a dream (\\"I might not be here tomorrow\\") and Alfredson keeps their blossoming relationship from ever seeming cutesy or contrived. And it has an innocent quality that transcends the sometimes bloody, disturbing storyline.<br /><br />And trust me, \\"Let the Right One In\\" has no sentimental ideas about children (even vampiric ones). They can be more violent than anyone, because they are more vulnerable than anyone.<br /><br />The stars of this movie are undeniably Hedebrant and Leandersson, and it's nothing short of amazing that they have never once acted before this movie. Both have the ice-pale faces and deep eyes of otherworldly creatures, making their friendship seem almost inevitable. Leandersson in particular is brilliant at showing the different sides of Eli -- one minute she's shyly asking about a Rubik's cube, the next she's bellowing at her creepy familiar.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" is a hauntingly beautiful story of children's friendship and love, wrapped in the most unique vampire stories in many years.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|If this were just another comic book film, I wouldn't be making the statements I'm about to make regarding this film. This film has reached a masterpiece status among it's many fans and I think they're watching this film through rose colored Bat-glasses!<br /><br />This is a fine film, but it's flawed on many levels. For one thing it's inconsistent, as this is supposed to be a Batman film that is realistic...right? Well, is it realistic that Batman and Rachel Dawes could fall from a skyscraper and crush a car with their impact without even being injured or somewhat slightly dazed!? I know it's a comic book film and I usually don't pick apart superhero movies for these types of things because it's fantasy, but 'The Dark Knight' is supposed to be something more...isn't it? I thought this was the \\"adult superhero movie\\"?...not my words,...just what I've heard.<br /><br />Another problem with this film is Batman/Bruce Wayne(Played by a the ever-capable Christian Bale)is so one dimensional in this film. The Batman voice borders on absurd and Bruce is not much more the a stereotypical \\"rich guy\\". Heath Ledger gives an excellent twisted performance as the Joker, but it's not Oscar worthy! While I like Nolan's direction, the film suffers from not really having much plot and being painfully long! I'm also a little put off too by the fact that Spider-Man 3 took such hard criticism, when this film has received so many rave reviews.<br /><br />Lets compare the two films. I really should compare it to Spider-Man 2, but that would be a landslide in Spidey's favor.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3  VS  The Dark Knight<br /><br />1)Spider-Man/Peter Parker VS  1)Batman/Bruce Wayne<br /><br />Winner - Spider-Man/Peter Parker has so much more depth and character development. We understand and feel his problems. Which continues in all three films.<br /><br />Loser Dark Knight - Batman Begins was a great origin, but the evolving character development was completely forgotten in The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Villains<br /><br />Sandman/Green Goblin/Venom  VS  Scarecrow/Joker/Two face<br /><br />Winner - Spider-Man 3 The villains are so much more developed.<br /><br />The Dark Knight - This was close, but as much as I admire the realistic villains of this film, I didn't feel they were well developed, very good performances by the actors no doubt, but I need more than the Joker telling how his father cut his mouth or more random babble to get a grasp of his character. Scarecrow is nothing more than an amusing cameo and Two Face only come into the film in the last act(much like Venom in Spider-Man 3). I guess he'll be back in part 3?<br /><br />Plots<br /><br />Spider-Man 3<br />Parker/Spidey's on going balancing act between juggling his personal life and his superhero alter ego. Now being affected by alienation of his best friend(who thinks he killed his father), estranged girlfriend and the symbiote trying to take over his mind. Not to mention fighting the Sandman(who really killed his uncle) and Venom who hates Parker for ruining his life! Whew!....I know, I know that's a lot to chew on!<br /><br />The Dark Knight<br /><br />Batman is thinking of giving up crime fighting to be with the woman he loves.......I guess?<br /><br />Winner - Spider-Man 3 - We know everyone's motives and they make sense, it may have been an ambitious undertaking, but I think it was pulled off fairly well. I know a lot of people thought that Venom was under used, but so was Two face in The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Over all<br /><br />The Dark Knight is a very impressive film with some great FX and cast! Both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight have a feel like no other super hero films. Ya see?....I'm a fan, I just don't want to be told something is a flawless masterpiece when it's obviously not. Regardless of it's flaws, it's still a very good movie. I'm glad I own it and I can't wait to see part 3!<br /><br />UPDATE ON DVD AND FEATURES<br />The Two Disc edition is really a disappointment, the picture isn't great and the sound goes from whispering voices to extremely loud explosions. The extras on this edition are pretty lame too, I smell a super edition around the corner! They're gonna milk this one dry!on this edition are pretty lame too, I smell a super edition around the corner! They're gonna milk this one dry!

A must-see.hat seem to swallow everything up. And he handles the entire storyline gracefully. Every part of the movie has the same matter-of-fact, unflinching treatment, including the nastier parts -- such as a gruesome blood-harvesting murder by Hakan, or when Eli attempts to enter a house without being invited. Trust me, it's bad.    The most loving attention is devoted to the children's friendship, which manages to be as strange and beautiful as a rare dragonfly. Their nighttime meetings almost have the quality of a dream (\\"I might not be here tomorrow\\") and Alfredson keeps their blossoming relationship from ever seeming cutesy or contrived. And it has an innocent quality that transcends the sometimes bloody, disturbing storyline.    And trust me, \\"Let the Right One In\\" has no sentimental ideas about children (even vampiric ones). They can be more violent than anyone, because they are more vulnerable than anyone.

A must-see.
B00026WU7I|5.0|Blood on the Tracks being Dylan's 1975 release and his 15th studio album was his return to Columbia Records after having released two albums with Asylum Records. The album reached nr 1 on the Billboard 200 and it is easy to see why. This ranks up there with other great releases such as<br />Highway 61 Revisited and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\", \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" and \\"Shelter from the Storm\\". The book-let has a list of the muisicians and a very good essay about Dylan written by Pete Hamill. There are no lyrics but being that the album is loaded with the pain from his seperation from his then wife Sara Dylan this is easy to understand. 5/5.
B00000637V|5.0|The first time I listened to this album (which I had to borrow from my dad) I only liked two songs.  Don't get me wrong, I had listened to Lou Reed's live albums \\"Live\\" and \\"Rock 'n' Roll Animal,\\" which featured a few songs from this album, but I just didn't enjoy it.  However, having listened back several times since then, it is without a doubt one of the top albums in my collection.  This album is the most complete definition of concept album, or rock opera.  While, Lou Reed's lyrics are so vivid, for me, as a musician, the music is what really enhances the whole experience.  The music and arrangements enforce what the lyrics are trying to convey.  If you really pay attention, the music in the first half of the album is rather light (so-to-speak) and whimsical.  However, in the second half it slows down, at times being just Lou Reed's voice and his guitar.  The arrangements by Bob Ezrin really help emphasize the downward spiral and then the quiet, sober, and sad look back at a couple of wasted souls.  While I respect others comments, I have to respectfully disagree with a few, I felt that there was no excess on this album.  Every instrument, every part, needed to be there.  All the little nuances are enhanced in some way by some part of the music.  This is truly one of the few albums that gets better every time you listen to it.  You take more from it, you hear more, you feel more.  Yes its a depressing album, without a doubt the most depressing of all time, surpassing \\"The Wall,\\" but by the end of \\"Berlin\\" one can't help but feel a glimmer of hope within themselves.  As the saying goes, everyone feels better after a good cry.
1594481717|3.0|Pink's premise: Business leaders seeking an edge in our competitive, tech-saturated world will require skills like design, empathy and storytelling to put their products and services out front. But the author's prescription for developing these sensibilities--like taking a drawing class or walking a labyrinth--are a bit pie-in-the-sky. Let's face it: attending a \\"Laughter Workshop\\" won't help me design the next iPhone. Still, the book has some interesting insights and anecdotes, like the inner-city, design-focused high school that has helped kids overcome major socio-economic obstacles.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This is a great new CD from Enya. Those who enjoy her sound will get a new thrill from this!
0743496736|2.0|Third Picoult book i have read and it is the second horrible ending. And I don't mean that I hated it because it was sad, I have a lot of books that I love that have not happy endings...this ending was just stupid, just like in My Sister's Keeper.     If one more other books has such a bad ending I may never read her again. She thinks she is making the book unpredictable, but really she is just turning a great book bad. Again
B000002WUD|5.0|This is an absolute must have. Any true Elvis fan will want his definitive collections and this is one of three box sets that encompass the bulk of his material, this being the 1970's tracks. As always, alternate takes and a complete live cd add a little extra to this, not to mention a great booklet that behind the scenes info and great pictures. No Elvis devotee should be with out this.
1595141715|4.0|I bought this because I mistakenly thought it was a new Chris Crutcher book, and because the teaser on the flap sounded intriguing.      Instead, I discovered a \\"new\\" author who has woven a complicated, emotionally truthful book that takes seriously how very seriously teens take remarks to heart.      The topic of suicide is handled frankly, yet somewhat reservedly, and ultimately blames the only person who can be justly blamed.  The positive effects of the tapes on the lives of the grieving are deftly emphasized, and may transfer to the lives of readers.      I will tell many students about this book, for they deserve good books-- even on topics that frighten us all.    One complaint: If I'd been Asher's editor, I would have axed the intro chapter.
0743299795|5.0|If you want to understand why GM, Ford, and Chrysler are doomed and have been doomed for two decades, this is the book.<br /><br />I've worked both for GM (twice) and in Japan for a Japanese automotive supplier, and I can attest that this book really got it right.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while everyone in Detroit has read this book, they have never followed any of its advice or conclusions.  All the talk about restructuring the US automobile manufacturers is simply about reducing costs and not about making better products by working cooperatively with employees, suppliers, dealers, and customers. Instead, Detroit continues to beat up suppliers on price and wonders why their quality is poor, push employees on wages and wonders why employees care little if the company is successful, haggle with their dealer network to push unwanted cars onto unreceptive customers.<br /><br />We can bail out the industry financially, but until they learn to compete with the Japanese, they are doomed to decreasing relevance and increasing losses.<br /><br />This book isn't exciting to read, but nearly 20 years since its original publication, it remains as relevant as ever.
0812975219|1.0|Taleb tips us off to his game in the book.  Hidden in the many pages of gibberish, he mentions how authors who have little to offer to the human knowledge base write books, and if they can get word of mouth to reach a tipping point, the book will makes lots of money.  He also describes a computer program that can string words together and make it sound like intelligent points are being made while all along it is actually saying nothing.  Taleb has pulled a great prank on the publishing industry and his readers.  I had to buy the book for a class and Taleb took my money like so many others.  He is laughing all the way to the bank.    Don't be fooled by intelligent sounding titles and self proclaimed intelligent writers.  Don't waste time and money on this book, both are too scarce to squander.
B000002WNP|5.0|This is an often overlooked area of Elvis' career. In between the lackluster films(which I love) and their respective soundtracks,Elvis recorded some real gems that only added to his catalog. What is special about this collection for me is that they have included the lions share of the tracks from Elvis' legendary album \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\". Recorded at American Sound Studio's in Memphis in 1969.This album which included such classics as \\"Suspicious Minds\\",\\"In the Ghetto\\" and \\"Wearin' that loved on look\\", revitalized Elvis' career and set the stage for the next decade of standard setting live performances.Well worth the money for the true Elvis fanatic.
B0017APPSE|4.0|My impression was this particular Blu-Ray was crystal clear on my 50 inch plasma.  Every detail of the faces that you'd never expect to notice, I noticed.  The clarity was stunning although I've seen other Blue Ray movies that I haven't noticed the clarity as much.  The movie itself is not 5 star, but 4 or so.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is the controller that the PS3 should have had from the start. The Sixaxis controller can't compare to it. Besides having the rumble capabilities, the Dualshock 3 weighs about 40% more and feels much more solid than the Sixaxis. Battery life is excellent. I charge it every couple of weeks. If you own a PS3, then this is the controller to have.
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|I just got through watching this and I felt like I should return this movie to the store. I love musicals, in fact I keep up with musicals that come around but this is not worth the time you put to sit on the couch. All it was was a random assortment of songs with a cheap story wrote in between them. The music is god I'll give it that but if I wanted to hear old ABBA music I could have bought a CD. Don't waste your time on this so called musical it isn't worth the money to even rent it.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This is an awesome show, definitely one of the best on TV, and the DVD set does not disappoint. I purchased this as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. The packaging is clever but sturdy and the extras are great. If you are a fan of this show this is a must-have. If you're not a fan, what are you waiting for? check it out!
B00005JPUN|3.0|essentially this is an ok movie, well acted but 'cheap' in terms of production. The re-make with donald sutherland is quite superior.but the original still gives me the creeps!!!
B000FFJYB6|4.0|This is a great movie, but like most I didn't care for the ending of it. After seeing the movie, I read the book which the movie was based on. The movie takes a few liberty's, increases the importance of the other characters and some of the story line. In the movie, at the end, they show Willie getting on a bus heading for England. Skip is sitting next to Willie's parents. He gives his mom a hug and just gets on the bus, he doesn't pick-up Skip or doesn't say anything to him. There is no way that would have happened in real life. Willie knew he would never see him again. I read the book basicly to see how it ended, and it wasn't like the movie. I am not sure why they didn't use the books ending. I am only giving it 4 stars because of the ending.
B000002KD9|5.0|I've been a Neil Young fan since the day I first heard one of his songs, and this is one of the best records he's ever done. But I'm a fan of just about everything he's put out so...    Anyway in my opinion this is one of his very best
B0002F6BRE|1.0|I didnt like the copy I recieved of elf it looked like somebody made a copy of the movie and it was a bad copy
0609610570|5.0|No, this book is not casual reading, this book is education at its best. This book is for all the Ivy League graduates who have put Wall Street and Main Street in the mess of today.<br />Execution is a well written, but deep presentation of the most important principles of solid business functionality and process. If Congress were managed by the likes of Ram Charan and Larry Bossidy, we would all be paying less taxes and receiving the highest quality of services from our governmental agencies.<br />As a CEO of a big or small company; as CEO of your own life, I strongly recommend that you advance your education with a study, not a reading, a study of Execution.<br />When you are done, read it, listen to it and share it with your management team on a regular basis to create a truly effective business environment.<br />It is all about Execution!
B0016OMFPW|5.0|Roy is at his best on this one. This music on this cd just grooves, even the ballads are firey, reflective, and passionate. All of the music here draws you in to the moment,leaving you satisfied,yet longing for more. I rated this one five stars, hands down!!! The band is just filled with the future torch carriers of jazz to come.
B001F290E4|5.0|I love this CD, Seal is able to capture the vibe and fluidity of these old soul classics, no pretend stuff here.  I keep playing it and playing it again and love it more each time.  Highly recommend it.
B000UR9T8W|1.0|I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them \\"Trilogy\\".   The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.  If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|It's an entertaining survival story, but the US Region 1 NTSC DVD sold here is washed out and grainy, rendering otherwise outstanding scenery looking like a poor quality video tape.  I purchased the PAL Region 2 edition from Amazon UK and the difference is striking.  If you have a multi-region dvd player and a PAL compatible display - order that one.  It's the perfect type of film to justify a future Blu-Ray release.
0307454894|5.0|Like a lot of great books I've read, I heard about this story because of the upcoming movie with Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes.  Since they are two of my favorite actors, I was sure that there must be something worth looking at so I got the novel to read first.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie yet...but I'm not sure just HOW they can really do this story justice on film.  The complexities and timeframe of the story might be too much to get across in a two-hour film.<br /><br />The novel not only looks back on a lost love between a 15 year-old German boy and a 40 year-old woman but also addresses the monstrous shadow of the Nazi past cast over all Germans ever since.  It reads very fast without an ounce of fat on it.  The economy of the author is impeccible.  It doesn't dwell on the horrors of the Holocaust but succinctly considers the aftermath of the generations since: how do we live with this, how do we even begin to address it?<br /><br />The novel's believability often took me by surprise and I couldn't find a false note in it.<br /><br />Very powerful, excellently written.  Definitely worth reading.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Taking place in four places at once we have a Moroccan Arab scene, an American Mexican scene, a Japanese scene and the main scene.<br />The acting of the Japanese scene seems best, but the Moroccan boys are good.<br />Cate Blanchett gets a hard role of just being hurt.<br />For my money it is a badly done movie with police brutality by American and Moroccans. Children with rifles who aren't trained properly in their danger and use is actually important: most parents should see this.
B0015FML06|5.0|DVD just rocks the house.  Why U2 doesn't play \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" anymore is beyond me.  Kicking guitar and groovin bass line gets everybody dancing.  The band's music has a funner guitar jammin edge to it (pardon the pun) in this concert from the early eighties.  Cool songs like \\"Gloria\\", \\"A Day Without Me\\" and underrated songs like \\"Surrender\\" and \\"Seconds\\" are also never played anymore which is very sad.  \\"40\\" should end every U2 concert period.  Again the bass playing is exceptional throughout the concert set.  The band should bring a couple of these songs back to their present setlists.  \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\" and several other songs that have been played a zillion times on radio need a rest.
3822856282|5.0|What else can I say? The pictures are amazing. The character is a light hearted, opinionated, and beautiful young woman that will captive you with her substance, wittiness, and charm.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show is not a guilty pleasure, I watch this show and proudly shout on the highest mountain yes!!!and it is good!!! LOL all jokes aside I LOVE THIS SHOW. All must watch, all must buy. Haters fall back.
B000002UAI|4.0|I bought this CD used to help round out my Beatles CD collection. The CD is in great shape and arrived quickly. As a Beatles aficionado, I rate this disk 4 out of 5 stars. In 1964, The Beatles recorded and released two albums, made one movie, and toured the United States for the 1st time. As a result, half the songs on this CD are covers of American rock and roll classics, rather than all original Beatles material. They ran out of bandwidth, essentially. Still, the songs are great, and the originals include classics like I'm A Loser, Eight Days A Week and No Reply. Covers include Chuck Berry's Rock & Roll Music, Buddy Holly's Words Of Love, a couple of nice Carl Perkins tunes and the great medley Kansas City - Hey, Hey, Hey, one of my favorite Beatles covers. Well worth the $7 or so that I paid! I've yet to get a bad used CD from Amazon.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I can't believe being a avid Mc Cartney fan that I finally discoverd The Fireman. Where have I been?  Recently I stumbled over \\"Electric Arguments\\" by The Fireman, Paul and some dude who calles himself Youth.<br />I didn't expect much from the CD but after just one listen, I was shocked at how entertaining this disk was.  Strange, but surprisingly delightful, \\"Electric Arguments\\" had me go back for more and more. The best track, in my opinion, is \\"Highway\\".  That tune knocks me out.  The lead off tune is different and catchy. Somewhere in the Cd I noticed some Pink Floyd riffs.  Am I nuts?<br />Anyway, if you like Mc Cartney buy this CD.  Even if you are not a big Paul fan, take a chance on this effort.  You'll get no arguments from me on \\"Electic Arguments\\".  It is the best CD of the year!
0312427565|4.0|Tom Wolfe's research for The Right Stuff, is more historically accurate than the movie version. The book was warmly received by the astronaut community, especially among the surviving members of the original Mercury 7 astronauts. The book goes back to the beginning to the test pilots flying from Murac Field, now known as Edwards Air Force Base. The early jet and rocket research conducted at Edwards Air Force Base, led to Project Mercury, Project Gemini, Project Apollo and the Space Shuttle. You can very easily get lost in the pages of this book. Not only did Mr. Wolfe do his research on the historic aspect of the book, he also researched the personal lives of the pilots, including Chuck Yeager and Scott Crossfield. As the book comes forward in time, Mr. Wolfe researched the personal lives of the Mercury 7 astronauts. The competition for astronaut selection, was intense and in competition with the Soviet Union. After the selection of the Mercury 7, the astronauts did have an agreement with Life Magazine to do their life stories. This is one aspect of the movie that agrees with the book. The Media's aggressive way in pursuing their stories, was not too well received by the astronauts. The issue regarding \\"extra-ciricular\\" was mentioned in the book and the movie. The way the issue was presented in the movie, was completely different than the book version. In the book, Gus Grissom was accurately presented, a pilot and an engineer. After the explosive bolts on the access hatch of Liberty Bell 7 were activated, Grissom was concerned. He also wanted to find the answers on why they activated. It was later theorized, static electricity from the rotor wash of the recovery helicopter, led to the accidential activation of the explosive bolts and the loss of the Liberty Bell 7 spacecraft. The way Gus Grissom was portrayed in the movie, was not to well received by the astronaut community, especially among the surviving members of the Mercury 7 astronauts. In an interview of WallySchirra that I seen years later on NASA Television, Captain Schirra talked about this very issue. Captain Schirra stated the book was more historically accurate. He didn't agree with the way the story was presented and did not agree with the way Gus Grissom was portrayed in the movie. Captain Schirra stated, the movie should have been titled \\"Animal House in Space!\\" One of the other astronauts who was mentioned in the book, was Deke Slayton. When Captain Slayton was selected for astronaut training, he had an irregular heartbeat. NASA's medical staff were hoping the condition would clear itself, before Slayton made his first spaceflight. Deke Slayton would have made his first mission, after John Glenn. A few months before his mission, the irregular heartbeat did not clear itself. Medical stardards at that time, forced the NASA flight surgeon to remove Deke Slayton from his flight and was replaced by Scott Carpenter. Deke Slayton became the Director of Flight Crew Operations and was a very effective and respected leader of the astronaut community.<br />  For anyone who is interested in the beginning of the jet age and the early years of the space program, The Right Stuff is recommended reading. The book presents a excellent overview of that time in history and it explores the personal lives of the test pilots and the astronauts. After reading the book, the Internet will allow you to do any follow-up or detailed research on the subject if you so choose.
0060760273|5.0|I was given a copy of this book 31 years ago for my newborn twins. Today I purchased a new copy of Goodnight Moon for my soon to be born granddaughter. My children still remember all the words and little nuances of how I read this to them so many times.     I'm also buying Wynken, Blynken and Nod- another classic from so long ago, but such wonderful illustrations and words. You can't go wrong with these two classics for babies and older.  Hope you enjoy these books as much as our family has!

B0006A9FKA|3.0|Bloody British barmcakes. There is something about this type of humor I guess...I hate to say it cause I can't put my finger on it, but it's not always me cup of tea....Hmmm, can't explain it. I ain't got no barney. Sorry mate! No offense super-fans of this instant \\"classic\\"! I don't really like this bloke Shaun. Just don't. Well, he's OK I guess. But I HATE his dim mate salad dodger \\"Ed\\". Ed is already dead in many ways, so no big loss when the sad sack Deacon turns. But why keep the saddo around? You can shoot him now and not feel guilty. You know here's the deal for me--I find me patience completely spent by totally inept arses sabbing each other up with the nonstop schoolboy howler throughout an entire bloody picture. Drips and doylems deserve death. I've noticed with these post-apocalyptic/zombie flicks that the biggest problem--the biggest threat to you--is the other scunts your with. They'll get you killed my son! And man are they bloody annoying--all that shouting, ding-dongs, belly aching and all around stupidity. Alright, some funny moments so don't mean to whiz on your fish and chips if this is your bag. How did these blokes ever run an empire so large the sun never set on it? Nah just kidding mate, this flick's a jolly good time governor.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|Wasn't a big Rihanna fan when she first burst on the scene.  Once I found out she was hooked with Jay-Z, became more interested in her music.  This album validates that she is a superstar pop talent who can test the boundaries of the music.  It also doesn't hurt that Ne-Yo wrote some of her songs.  \\"Disturbia\\" is ABSOLUTELY my favorite Rihanna song to date(with \\"Take a Bow\\" next on the list).  Rihanna's songs always have slamming beats, she is obviously beautiful and she is fierce.  This album proves it.  I love it.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|Maybe it is the last third that blows it. What went wrong? This could have been good sci-fi. What a pity. We've had a lot of vampire and zombie movies over the years and many post-apocalyptic movies. I like 'em even if they aren't done that well, as does apparently a large swath of the public. So, I say the first half or so is excellent. Seeing a realistic depiction of a large city devoid of human beings, crumbling bit by bit, nature all around reclaiming ground, is interesting. New York City is the most cinematic location to digitally degrade with cutting edge computer effects with it's famous monuments and streets and gigantic skyskrappers and celebrated bridges. I've found Will Smith to not always be the most interesting actor but his performance works. Basically Smith is a military scientist in responsible for finding a cure for a super-virus similar to the disease in 28 WEEKS LATTER which turns people into fleshing eating crazed turbo-vombies. Luckily for Smith the ghouls in this flick are like vampires destroyed by sunlight. This allows him free reign over almost all of Manhattan during the day, except of course the insides of darkened buildings where monsters shelter themselves from deadly ultraviolet light. Meeting the monsters is the highlight of the movie for me. I was nervous. As for these transformed mutants of the night, they sound scary and look deformed by disease but fake. For the longest time I've said use make-up and masks when you can and cost effective computer effects for the extras--for the background zombies or zombies in dark environments when detail is less an issue. Up close in the light you got video game level quality and that is very lame. Things started to go downhill for me with a strange trap Smith gets caught in that I simply didn't buy and never found a good explaination for. After this his character is disapointing when confronted with a painful loss. Then we discover he is a man without faith in god which is a bad thing?? Not sure where they were going with that and if we're supposed to believe he got it back I simply missed that part--not that I cared in the first place. Without spoiling anything, the final nail on the coffin is the absurd conclusion to Smith's story. The timing of it! Yeah okay. And speaking of timing, got to love the scene on the wharf. Just in the nick of time, outta nowhere...What are those odds? In the end the movie wraps up and your just left with an uninteresting conventional movie.where they were going with that and if we're supposed to believe he got it back I simply missed that part--not that I cared in the first place.

B00021HBGS|5.0|Received this as a gift for my 3 year-old son-he loves it!  It can be used outside of the tub too. My son takes the road pieces and puts them together and runs his hot wheels on it.  Good to take on vacation.  My 5 1/2 year-old daughter likes it too.
030014332X|5.0|I wish I'd been given this wonderful book while I was still a kid. Then I wouldn't have felt so ignorant around the seder table and on vacation trips. Who were the Assyrians? The Sumerians? What's the pre-George W. background on those places we invaded? How did various religions spread? And how 'bout those Greeks? Written with a sense of wonder and respect, this book gives you a quick and fascinating overview of the history of the world that stays with you and puts today's events in perspective.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|PRODUCT WAS BRAND NEW IT PLAYS WELL IN MY PLAYSTATION 3 AND I LOVE IT.
B00007B6RW|5.0|I always buy the whole CD - no download. So...the CD has to have enough variety, drive and talent on it to interest me. This has it all. My taste in music is very broad, with the key lying in a musicians ability to keep me interested. Many artists songs become'tired' after multiple listenings. Not this artist.<br />I now own all the P!nk CD's and am happy with them all.<br />She doesn't get stuck in a 'genre'. There is a reflection of almost all music styles in each CD. Love it.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore has a sound that will remind you of the 80's punk scene... The guitars, full speed lyrics, humor and spike make you want to jump up and dance.  There is no way to listen to this album and not move your body.  They are young and somewhat raw and that is so appealing...they don't seem to be tainted by the mainstream media.      I wish only the best for the band and I will remain a loyal fan.  My 12 year old loves the band also....something we have in common.  Great job Paramore!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Don't read anything about this movie, don't watch the trailers, don't imdb it.  Just go see it or get the DVD.  It's one of the most brilliant, heartbreaking, and beautiful films to come out in a long time.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Just so everyone knows this is not they Trudy who typed the other reviews. This is her daughter, Mossmask.     Anyway...I simply love Avril Lavigne!, and I hate those who say her voice sucks or that she's bratty-cause she's NOT! I think she sings awesomely and people can connect to her sings. Plus, she is a very strong person. Did you know she sang at a concert the same day her grandfather died-after he died? Some of earth's population may think she is just horrorible and that she cusses too much (my dad thinks that) but I disagree, though I do think she does cuss a lot... So don't to so loser   who dises Avril. They are WRONG! Avril Lavigne is definitely one of my favorite artists and is totally one of the best female singers EVER!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This is a great product for Johnny Cash lovers. I bought it for my dad and the shows are just as he remembered them. It has a little bit of everything from the TV show, to songs, and clips from other performances. Great buy.

It is a great, funny, fear calming book.<br /><br />Who wasn't afraid of monsters in the dark as a child?<br /><br />And this illustrates, it is all in ones imagination, so do not be afraid.<br />Grover is silly and cute all the while he is sooo very afraid, which is delightful to all .<br />Excellent book, it is a real classic.
B000QFCD5O|3.0|Honestly I've been an Asia fan since the early 80's, grew up loving their stuff then grew to not care for them so much thru the 90's and beyond as they went through various members (Asia is not the same without Wetton's unique voice).  But nonetheless I am one of the diehards that will buy it if it has the Asia logo on it (CDs/LPs/PicLPs/Quadra/etc).  I was totally thrilled when I found this as it had the original 4 members performing live - their Live CD's are good, though they are a bit lackluster in live DVD's (never actually saw them in concert back in the day).  The Asia tracks are actually really good.  I was just disappointed to find so much non-Asia stuff on the 2 discs - stuff from the bands they were wth prior to Asia.  I would ahve rather had more of them with their own tracks than the mix of their predecessor band songs.  That's really the only reason for the mediocre rating.  Were it 2 discs of their stuff as Asia, which I'm sure they had enough of from the tour, I'd have probably slapped the other 2 stars on :-)
0545128285|4.0|When The Tales of Beedle the Bard was first mentioned on fansites, I was extremely excited....this excitement disappeared when we learned there were only seven copies available in the whole world and all but one were given to close friends or colleagues.      Excitement began to grow again when I learned that Amazon had purchased The Tales; however, the uncertainty of whether this purchase included publication rights was unknown.    The announcment of the publication of The Tales of the Beedle the Bard to support the Highlevel Group was wonderful.  I quickly ordered copies for the library and started counting down the days.    The book is a wonderful hardcover for the price.  My only complaint is that the book is so small.  As one who has gotten used to lugging the thick tomes of Books 1-7 around, this came as a little disappointment. I was able to finish the book in an hour.    I enjoyed all of the stories in this book. Rowling seemed to branch out to all areas of the magical world.  I found the tale of the hairy heart especially interesting. For those parents that deemed this too scary...I found Harry's journey much more nerve wracking and intense.  Voldemort's split soul and the creature at King's Cross seem to be right up there with a hairy heart.    I can see some of these stories recreated for a Reader's Theatre.  This book is not ground-breaking, but it is a wonderful addition for any Potter afficianado.
031606792X|5.0|This series is the best. I am slowly reading this great book,to not finish too soon. What will I read next???
B0015519VS|2.0|This album didn't meet up to my expectations. When I heard \\"Love In This Club\\", I loved it and I just knew I had to have this CD. When I got the CD in the mail and listened to it, I was very disappointed. There were too many ballads and nothing catchy. I have listened to the CD twice and that's all I intend on listening to it. I've given it a chance but it's just not working for me. The only songs I liked on it were Love In This Club, Love In This Club pt. 2, and Trading Places. When hearing his lyrics, I understand that he's grown as an artist but I feel that he should show his progress and his growth in more catchier songs, but that's just my opinion. Hopefully the next one will be better...
0132350882|5.0|This is a really excellent handbook for use in Design and Code Reviews.  After reading this very well written book it is much easier to be effective during code development and in code reviews by providing concise suggestions and being able to back them up with good rationale.  The disappointment comes in finding out how poorly written the existing software base is when compared against this Clean Code standard.  Even worse is developing new code which cannot meet the clean code standards for one reason or another.    I highly recommend this book for everyone involved in software development.  The very pragmatic and disciplined approach takes practice and skill but the rewards are well worth it.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|I'm not a big country fan but after buying her self-titled album, I knew I had to buy this one. It's great. Taylor Swift is a very talented songwriter and singer. My favorites on the CD are Love Story, You're Not Sorry, and Breathe.
B001NB6IN8|2.0|With a lead-in track that sounds an awful lot like the first track from the previous album, Infinity on High, Fall Out Boy's latest effort quickly establishes and then repeatedly reinforces the notion that they peaked a few years ago, and aren't really doing anything new so much as they're doing the same things with more pomp and polish.  I was quickly struck by how contrived and forced the lyrics seem on Folie &agrave; Deux, while similar sentiments were much more artfully expressed on every earlier effort.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly, the lyrics seemed effortless and therefore more genuine in previous collections; where Folie &agrave; Deux is trying desperately to sell you on the image and idea of angsty post-teen rockers (I Don't Care), From Under the Cork Tree was so wrapped up in itself, so utterly unconcerned about what you thought, that it didn't have to bother trying to sell you anything at all; it simply was.<br /><br />It may come to be that I ultimately regard Folie &agrave; Deux from Fall Out Boy in much the same way I ultimately regarded Adore from Smashing Pumpkins; while I disliked Adore tremendously when it came out, in hindsight, I could pin much of the disappointment on the expectations that the band had set with their earlier work, and I was able to enjoy the album on its own merits.  Here lies the rub for Fall Out Boy -- the arc of quality in their work has been so good for so long that it had to start dipping eventually.<br /><br />There isn't really anything wrong with Folie &agrave; Deux, but that's only half the story.  The other half, the half that matters, is that there isn't really anything right, either.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|Wich is pretty much what I thought of Batman Begins, altough this one is better. The main issue I have with the movie is Mr. Bale. I don't think he got it right, his voice acting as Batman is kind of hilarious. I also find it kind of strange when Bruce Wayne interacts with Lucius Fox and it almost seems like a James Bond movie, when all the gadgets have to be explained to cool and detached 007. Come on ! We are talking about freaking Bruce Wayne here, the guy who built that Batcave all by himself. The guy is a science genius, he doesn't need those kind of explanations, even if he needs someone to help him build this stuff, he knows what they are talking about. I know this might seem nitpicky but it kind of bothered me. Heath Ledger's performance is very good, very frightening, altough not very humorous. His tragic death unfotunately adds a bitter taste to the whole thing.   One thing I miss about Batman in prety much all the movies is his \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" detective persona. I'd really like to see more of that but I guess that doesn't make for spectacular hollywood superhero cinema.  Nolan is a good director and he made two good Batman movies, but I disagree when people say these are great. I think he can still deliver a great movie if he manages to go deeper into the modern Batman persona, especially the way he was interpreted in the comics of the 90's, that would be a great reference.   And please, could the guy from \\"Batman - The Animated Series\\" do the voice-overs (forgot his name) ? Pleeeeeease ? Can't stand that \\"grunt\\"

B0010B5KQW|5.0|LOL. I just pulled my original cassette tape of this album that I bought in 1983. This album will be golden in the punk era forever. Other original cassettes that I have are Minor Threat - First Two 7's, S.O.D. - Speak English or Die, Sacred Reich - Surf Nicaragua, Slayer - Reign in Blood, Metallica - Kill'em All..... OMG, I still have Kraftwerk on cassette. BUT, anyway.... all these are classic albums from the 80's...must haves if you like this genre.
0743270754|5.0|I've read about 10 books about Lincoln, so I figured this wouldn't add much to what I already knew. Rather than original research, the author has focused on comparing & contrasting the lives & careers of the four major men who made up the Lincoln administration. Since I knew relatively nothing about Seward, Chase & Bates, I learned a great deal about life during the tumultuous times leading up to the Civil War, and knowing this background, I was fully prepared for the coming together of these great men in 1861.     I think these men would thorougly enjoy this comparison of their lives & points of view.

B001ACH4DS|4.0|Too much rock for me, but wanted to have the American Idol CD. If you come out with one that's a little more low key let me know and I'll be there for you. You've definitely got talent and have a beautiful voice.
3940004502|5.0|This three cd packet of music delivers just like all of Chris Rea's music. His last endeavor of 11 cds of music on the history of the blues is a must in any collection of the blues. If you have not discovered Chris', then buy this bundle of extremely enjoyable music. He includes three LPs in the packet as well. His writing, singing and total professionalism have always come through into his music. Buy this and any other work he has done. His voice is a credit to the blues as is his mastery of many instruments that he plays on many of his cds. The total performer. If you like Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton, then you will enjoy Chris Rea.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Review for the Blu Ray second disk featurette:<br /><br />This film is truly awesome and since there are just about 300 reviews on here describing how amazing this film is I wanted to stray away from reviewing the movie and write a little bit about the special feature: \\"Batman Unmasked\\" and how great and interesting this short documentary was. I know the special features on the blu ray are very lacking but it doesn't take away from this special feature.<br /><br />If you are as interested in the villains Batman has as much as I am, you will know they are a central part of how successful The Dark Knight has become since his creation over 70 years ago.<br /><br />In \\"Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of the Dark Knight\\" different former editors and writers for DC Comics as well as several psychologists and private investigators link the connection between Batman's most famous villains and real life criminals such as Jeffrey Dahmer, the Una bomber, and many more. The Joker and The Riddler are some of the most interesting villains they discuss. Heath Ledger's absolutely amazing performance as The Joker reminds us how amazingly cynical the character is. This kind of behavior is connected to some other horrible criminals in real life history and how their behavior is similar to the Joker's, who has no remorse for wrongdoings.<br /><br />Batman is very interestingly compared to Theodore Roosevelt who had a similar life style to that of Bruce Wayne. Roosevelt's wife and mother both died on the same day and shortly after he went out in the streets as what the documentary stated as sort of a night patrol. His father was also a very caring man and is compared to Thomas Wayne.<br /><br />I was really blown away by this special feature so I went ahead and reviewed it so nobody would overlook it and leave it to the side. It's got the same feel to it as a well done History or Discovery Channel documentary! Don't miss it! :)
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These RealTrigger accessories are great. I bought them for my husband after his continual complaining about his fingers always sliding off the PS3 controller's triggers. We ordered 3 sets of these, one set for a SixAxis the other two for DualShock 3's. They snapped right on, match the controller's buttons perfectly and both my husband and I find the controllers have been improved dramatically by using these. If you or someone you know are dissatisified with the triggers on the PS3 controllers, then I would say these are a must-have accessory.

1439102813|5.0|Losing yourself has to be one of the worst things that can happen. Still, many people do lose themselves every day in a silent war raging within themselves. This war, largely unnoticed, is one that Alice has to deal with.<br />And deal with it she does - as best she can.<br /><br />Having seen this process for myself, I wanted to take Alice by the hand and hold her tightly because some of the reading hurt. It actually stung, digging deep into my mind, and I thought this said a lot about the book. On one hand it had a scientific explanation to it all, but the other hand had a feel to it that was very human. A person clinging to their sense of self, a boat lost amidst the waters, only to find that the world is no longer the place they remember. Mirages, flashbacks to the past, places that are not place; the wording used to describe everything that was transpiring was so well-written that it struck a nerve with it. In striking that nerve it made me want to read on, and reading on made me want to finish.<br /><br />If the ideas contained in the outline of this book seem to resonate with your reading mind, hit it and hit it hard. You'll love the book and feel sad for it as well, and finishing it might wake up something in your mind. Even if you do not normally read this sort of material, take a chance with it and see what you think. Seeing this struggle reminds you what it means to be human sometimes; there are pretty place to live, but sometimes living in those places are struggles unto themselves. I was touched by the book, beautifully touched, and recommend it for whoever feels the book has merit.<br />Recommended highly for those it appeals to.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|This series was a bit of a let down.  I was expecting more, having read some excellent Revolutionary War books, Jeff Shaara's 'Rise to Rebellion' and 'The Glorious Cause' among them.  The problem is that this series was based on David McCullough's book of the same name, which was a bore, just like his '1776' was a bore.  I guess having read books of a broader scope, narrowing the focus to only John Adams chopped out so much more that was interesting.  '1776' would have been a better series, providing McCullough wasn't the sole source.  PS:  'Rome' and 'Deadwood' were the best HBO series of all time.  Full stop.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|This is yet another great example of a film that demonstrates that the word protagonist doesn't mean hero. It ranks up there with \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" and \\"Payback\\" as a terrific way of making the bad guy someone you want to win.<br /><br />I love all the songs. They get stuck in your head the same way \\"Once More With Feeling\\" did. They are wonderfully done. My fianc&eacute; criticizes Nathan Fillion's voice, but I think he did a fine job. However, Neil Patrick Harris is the true standout of awesome talent. He did a great job on this project.<br /><br />The use of video blogging as a setup for the plot is genius, and I was actually kind of sad when Act 3 featured no blogging whatsoever. On a side-note, I think the sequel should definitely be titled \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Podcast.\\"<br /><br />My one gripe with this product has been mentioned by others: why a DVD-R? I know the limited shelf-life of DVD-Rs has been exaggerated, but still! Why not have a professionally made DVD that will last longer? I have seen a ton of low-budget stuff make it's way to DVD. Hell, \\"My Name is Bruce\\" is getting a blu-ray release! \\"Dr. Horrible\\" would be an awesome blu-ray! This complaint is not enough to get me to avoid buying this, but I am certainly disappointed with the quality of the product. Here's hoping for a future double-dip with some kind of deluxe edition.

0743289692|4.0|This is a fascinating and thought-provoking autobiography about a woman who finds the courage to break free from her family and culture.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali was raised as a devout Muslim, predominantly in Somalia and Kenya.  Her father was absent for large parts of her life and she was raised by her mother and grandmother.  She was a bright child who questioned aspects of the Islamic faith from an early age, particularly the inequalities between men and women.  As a child she and her sister were subjected to female \\"circumcision\\".  In her early twenties, her father arranged her marriage to another Muslim man.  Ayaan chose instead to escape and seek asylum in the Netherlands.  She renounced her religion and became outspoken on the subject of female oppression by Muslims.  Eventually she also became a member of Parliament in the Netherlands.<br /><br />I found the book very interesting, but it is not the definitive word on the Muslim faith and parts made me feel uncomfortable - for example, when she insists that the millions of Muslims around the world who see Islam as a religion of peace are wrong and do not fully understand it.  I thought she was very brave to speak out about female oppression, but her points would be better made and probably better received had she not attacked so many other central tenants of Islam.<br /><br />Ayaan's experiences are very specific to the countries and cultures that she grew up in and it often felt that she couldn't make that distinction and accept that life for Muslims in other cultures might be very different from hers. For example, when she talks about her experience of female genital mutilation (a horrific procedure which is chillingly described), she implies strongly that the Muslim faith is responsible for female genital mutilation, but in reality it is more a cultural than religious practice that is also common among many non-Muslims.<br /><br />At times her own story does not appear to support her assertions.  While there is no doubt that she had a difficult childhood, throughout her life she and her sister were given access to education and could move about freely.  Ayaan secretly married a man of her own choosing (although she later denied that the marriage had taken place and it probably wasn't legalized).  Her mother was able to divorce her first husband, and when Ayaan chose to leave her husband, that decision was accepted by the Muslim elders. Even when she talks about female genital mutilation, I found it interesting that her very religious father didn't want her to have it and that it was her grandmother who insisted and arranged it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and found it hugely thought provoking.  I particularly enjoyed and was moved by the section when Ayaan first comes to live in the West and how amazed she is by things that we take for granted (or at least expect) everyday: street signs, buses adhering to timetables, policemen being helpful.  While I don't agree with all of Ayaan's views, I do applaud her courage and feel inspired by her commitment to make a difference in the world.difficult childhood, throughout her life she and her sister were given access to education and could move about freely.

0061537934|5.0|This book was great; it has all the important elements of a great novel. I really didn't think a story told by a dog would work, but it did. And fantastically! It was a sweet, endearing story. Loved it!
0142004413|4.0|My Family and other Animals was a great book about a truly eccentric family. The characters quirks spiced up the novel but the lengthy descriptions of animals and plants by the author and zoologist, Gerald Durrell, were a little dry. I often found myself tempted to skim through these passages to get back to the plot of the story. It was truly amazing to believe that all these incredibly detailed descriptions could be thought up by a boy at age 12. But it was equally amazing that he experienced all these awesome adventures and was able to remember them and pen his story later on in his adult life and let the reader enjoy his experiences as much as he did.
0307269752|5.0|This book should not be missed by anyone who wants a quality , engrossing, thrilling read. Everything about it is fabulous.  I can't wait for the US publication of Larsson's second book in the series, due in August.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this terrific book highly enough.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this CD. I heard Gotta Be Somebody and loved it. THen I bought it and thought some of the guitars added a little country twang that I didn't like (made me look back to their huge belt buckle CD cover) but I realized after listening to a couple different songs that Nickelback hadn't changed a bit and they just continue to get better. Although I will say the majority of their songs and lyrics are all sexual, but hey that's Nickelback for you :P
B0014R34A6|5.0|When my sister and I were children, we were true Lego-holics. We both saved all our pocket money for Lego, and we always asked Santa for more. When we reached puberty, we were the proud owners of a huge Lego village. We even had a designated \\"Lego room\\" at our house. When we grew older and moved away to college, the Lego village moved to the attic.    Now you can start with Lego as young as 1 year. When my daughter was 8 months, I bought a box of quatro. She built countless towers, and she still opens the box now and then. She loves to stack the blocks and then pushes them over. When my daughter turned 2 years, my parents gave her a suitcase full of Duplo Lego. Occasionally she would play with her Duplo Lego a little, but it was not until she turned 2.5 years that she really started enjoying to explore the endless possibilities.    During our last visit to Belgium, my daughter got her first Duplo Lego Train. It is a battery powered train that runs for 2 minutes at a time. My daughter loves to fill up the gas tank (of an electric train??) which makes a funny noise. She does add her own little touch to the whole scene: the passengers are not humans, but dinos!     First my sister and I, now my daughter... yes indeed, we can officially call it a family tradition!    Duplo Lego is ONLY made in Europe (no worries about lead paint or any other chemicals), and is known for its great quality and durability. My \\"old\\" Lego village in Belgium still looks like new. But of course, quality comes with a price tag. Duplo Lego is not cheap, but if you ask me, worth every single penny.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|If you enjoyed Taylor Swift's first CD you are going to love this one. Her voice has changed a bit, but it continues to get better every year. Her lyrics definitely resemble her sense of humor about life, boys, friends, and growing up.

I wasn't expecting much from the BLU RAY disc, after all, this program was filmed in 2002. Well guess what..... this new disc is awesome!! The color and clarity make you feel like you are watching it for the first time. I'm actually seeing things in some scenes that I barely noticed before. This Blu ray  is just an outstanding example of making a great show even better.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|After the events of \\"Batman Begins\\", Batman (Christian Bale) is keeping the streets of Gotham safe from dangers. However, a fiendish clown crook named The Joker (Heath Ledger) with his clown goons have been commiting terror throughout the city with his sick twisted sense of humor and mayhem. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) join forces with our hero to put a stop to his hideous crimes once and for all.<br /><br />Co-starring Maggie Gyllenhall, Michael Caine, Eric Roberts, Michael Jai White, Cillian Murphy and Anthony Michael Hall, this is truly one of the best movies in recent memory. This is one of those rare sequels that can actually be better then the original and can be a masterpiece, while \\"Batman Begins\\" which rebooted the Batman series thanks to Christopher Nolan was the appetizer then get ready for the main course which is this movie. This one is more action packed, more smarter and more emotional then the last one as it with a great performance by the late Heath Ledger who passed away when the film was done filming, which is kind of tragic for a very good actor like him to die so early for he gives a performance of a lifetime as everyone's favorite Bat-villain more then Jack Nicholson or Caesar Romero. Co-writer, producer and director Christopher Nolan has proved to himself to be one of the greatest directors in recent memory for he reinvented the superhero movie genre much like Richrd Donner did with \\"Superman 1 & 2\\", Bryan Singer with \\"X-Men 1 & 2\\" and Sam Raimi with \\"Spider-Man 1 & 2\\" but making it more of a gritty adult crime action drama then just a comic-esque type of film. The movie includes the origin of Two-Face which Dent becomes as this portrayl puts the Tommy Lee Jones version to shame, i'm suprised how the film got away with a PG-13 rating since it was a violent film with some dark humorous moments like the pencil trick to the eye scene as it's both disturbing and funny at the same time. This is a more grown-up Batman movie then before with the exception of \\"Batman Begins\\" as it proves that even a comic book movie can be a great masterpiece.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray contains brillaint picture and sound with the action sequences that will blow your home theater away! There's awesome extras like BD-Live but for those with BD-live enabled Blu-ray players, \\"Gothan Uncovered: Creation of a Scene\\" with Nolan and company giving you behind the scenes of a scene if you see a point that pops during the movie on this mode, Featurettes, interviews, 6 Mock news broadcasting episodes  called \\"Gotham Tonight\\", galleries, stills, Poster Art, Joker cards gallery, Concept art, Trailers and TV Spots.

0441003257|4.0|The end of the world is at hand, and the forces of Heaven and Hell are preparing for the final battle of Good vs. Evil.  Unfortunately, the representatives of both Heaven and Hell have grown rather fond of Earth in general, and humans in particular, and decide that they would prefer not to have it all end.  Unfortunately, the Antichrist was misplaced at birth, causing confusion among the gathering forces.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ride forth on their motorcycles and the end of creation seems at hand.<br /><br />Written with an ineffable sense of humor, this book manages to make the end of the world fun, a farce that will leave the reader giggling, if not laughing out loud.  Very entertaining.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|this band has come along way , you really have to give them credit for STILL keeping it original , i mean , come on look at all the bands now who just copy other bands but fall out boy's lyrics and melodies have always been thier own and they maintain it once again in this release. i have and love every fob cd , and still after this release ( from under the cork tree) is still my personal favorite but this album is also another great cd to add to the collection and i will be listening to it for quite a while i wont and cant give up on these guys ...go when i go to school i will just laugh when i hear the words * omg fall out boy is gay , lil wayne ftw omg * because i know FOB is here to stay <3
B000A2W1X2|5.0|This movie combines the elements of story-telling into a first-class drama. The characters are developed, the plot reaches a climax when it should, and the ending leaves us just enough room to imagine almost any future for this couple and their child. The acting of Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane and the other actors/actresses, as well as the writing and direction, are first class, and I love the music, which is so beautiful that I've been trying to obtain a copy of it ever since. As a lover of classical music, I find that I want to watch the movie as much for Christopher Gunning's score as for the other qualities of the movie. Anyone who loves the stories of Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Thomas Hardy, George Eliot and other fine writers that have been made into movies should enjoy this movie over and over. My wife and I do.    Don't be put off by the Chinese characters on the cover. The movie is entirely in English. Unfortunately, I see that Amazon no longer carries it, so don't delay in getting a copy as they may all disappear soon.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|I was really disapointed with product in more than one way. First off the movie desrves like a million stars but this does not. If you want to buy it save yourself money on the onew disk one because the special features are just a bad joke. So unless you want a digital copy (which I do enjoy) get the one disk. Also this was supposed to arrive on the 10th of decmber it didn't arrive till the 13th, it was only  days but 3 days i had to wait longer so the shipping absolutley deserves negative stars just like the special features. But once again do get the one disk edition of the movie because the movie itself is amazing and if i was rating the movie not the product it would have 5 stars not one.
B00129H7VS|5.0|When I popped this edition into my PS3 and settled down to watch, I was prepared to be wowed by the visual detail of 1080p etc etc. What I was not prepared for was the incredible sound. After five years of wearing out the DVD set of BoB I thought I'd heard it all. And I do not have a dedicated 5.1 surround sound home theatre audio set--just the built-in speakers of my LCD HDTV flat panel. I was blown away. (At one point in Episode 2, I was almost literally blown away.) First of all, the volume seems louder. It may or may not be, but it's just that every sound and sound effect seems to have so much more depth than I remember from the DVD. Snatches of background dialogue can be understood. Animal life, crickets, flies, birds, clear and vivid. The crunch of bootheels, the screech of steel on steel, the impact of shrapnel on stone. And every weapon has a clear and distinct voice--the M1, the M1 carbine, the Thompson, the BAR, the MGs, the mortars, the German K-98s, artillery shells, tank shells ... I could go on. The sound detail and immersion is simply incredible and completely envelops you. Not even mentioning the music. For the first time in years, Michael Kamen's score brought me to tears of sheer direct emotional effect.    The new interactive version of the old Field Guide is an excellent resource. I haven't yet heard the real E/506th vets' picture-in-picture commentary; I'll do that on second run-through. BoB has been, since it first showed, the high water mark of the latter-day World War II oeuvre, and one of the best-written shows ever. This Blu-Ray version brings it to life all over again.
0553103547|5.0|A Game of Thrones is the first book of George R.R. Martin's masterpiece, fantasy epic. The good news for those familiar with this series (no A Dance with Dragons is not yet finished) is that the series is being brought to the small screen by HBO. If you are a fan of Rome or the Arthurian legends keep your eyes and ears open.<br /><br />For the last year I have been living without cable, but I will once again be swimming in the deep end when this amazing work is brought to life. Like much of the other series on HBO, this will be a story for mature viewers. It is a story of hard living in a kingdom very much resembling England during the Wars of the Roses. There is a touch of fantasy but it is not heavy handed. The main characters are all human insofar as they are from the human species. Another difference is that this story is not the standard Good vs. Evil. It is a human story and in that sense it is a contemporary tale.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I bought this DVD for my sister because she is a daft punk fan. Both being longtime fans of anime, we watched it together and were wowed. The animation is amazing, the color pops out from the screen. It's not hard to follow either; I was not familiar with the story at all but its really fun.<br /><br />Basically, a super famous intergalactic pop group is kidnapped by a team of people who hope to market them on Earth. The music is all dancey-techno stuff by Daft punk but it is appropriate to the futuristic look of the charachters and the story.<br /><br />All in all, it was really fun to watch. So glad I bought it.
B001BKZDB4|5.0|The dvd arrived on time and is brand new and sealed as described. There was no damaged. Thank you.
B001ED7C58|5.0|The music fits well with the movie and on its own.  It is a good mix of bands, and is able to create an energy on its own.  I think all the songs speak to the flavor of the movie.  Love Bella's lullaby its haunting, but simple as a lullaby should be.  Listen to the end, it creates an uncertainty which is very appropriate to Bella and Edwards future.  I like Pattinson's recording as well and it plays at spots throughout the movie.  If you don't understand the lyrics, google them.  They are simple and heart felt.  My personal favorite is the Linkin Park, tune. Laave all the Rest.  It plays during the closing credits, you miss it during the movie, but I think speaks well to the coming of New Moon and Eclipse. Beautiful.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I loved this movie because it showed how sometimes things might not work out how you think they will, but in the end, they do work out. Keira Knightly is absolutely gorgeous and wonderful in this movie. Matthew Macfadyen plays an interesting character with a personality that takes time to warm up to. As the movie heats up, he becomes more lovable and exciting.
1595141979|5.0|THIS IS FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE READ THE BOOK AND WANT TO DISCUSS THE ENDING:  REPEAT PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK YET.    SPOILERS!!    For those of you who have read Shadow Kiss, I knew there was a strong possibility that this ending could happen while reading the book, it seemed too dangerous to not lose one of the main characters in Rose's life.  However, that did not soften the blow when it actually happened.  I do have to give Mead major props for making Dimitri a Strigoi rather than killing him and thus all hope I might have had for the next book.  Still, it has never been mentioned if there is any other way for a Strigoi to go back to the way he way was.  I mean just to know if there was or wasn't a possibility would be a big help...does anyone remember her writing about this?  Also, I have to say, I know that it would be extremely hard for Lissa to have brought him back from the dead but I couldn't believe that she wouldn't do that for Rose who had more of less given most of her life up for Lissa's.  Granted she is \\"supposed to\\" but it seems odd that Lissa would save a bird and a dove but not be willing to save Dimitri.  I got false hope during that moment thinking she would bring him back...of course that was dashed again whne I finished.  I did love the book (even though I can't bring myself to re-read the end), but this review isn't really saying the book was good or bad just comments I wanted to toss out there.
B000XA5K48|1.0|Unfortunately Amazon is saying this is in stock (as with many other products on the website) -- yet days later you receive a later apologizing for the delay. Be aware of this if you are buying for Xmas
B0002OXVDW|4.0|This set is a treasure.  If it wasn't supurb in every way, it just was not acceptable or produced back then on the MGM lot.  People KEEP THEIR CLOTHES ON and DO NOT DO CHEAP PHYSICAL THINGS.  Language is CLEAN.  And, things do not get BLOWN-UP or flashed before your eyes before one can even focus on it.  MGM  entertains, makes you think and portrays wholesome social values.  The DANCING is supurb.    A 4 star rating relates to the fact that I believe the people who put this teasury together could have done a better job of it.  Acutually at MGM this quality would not have been tolerated.  That said, the era needs to be preserved and brought to us in some form.  If this is the best we can come up with, so be it.  With any sort of luck another set will be produced that is of MGM standards. This set documenting the great time in the movies, is worth every minute viewing and the $ amount paid to acquire it; if you equate things that way.  I just think a greater production could have been made of this great era.    I recommend it.  You will love it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I love this movie. I'm not interested in either surfing or California, but that's no handicap to enjoying \\"Shelter,\\" because what it's really about is relationships. The screenplay is sharp and believable, the pace is exactly right, the story is engaging without being too melodramatic, and the ending is both very happy and completely believable, unusual and welcome in a gay movie.    Brad Rowe's performance is fine and understated, appropriate for the slightly older and more experienced lover, and Trevor Wright is amazing in a strong, intense, very intelligent performance. I'd never heard of him before, but I'll be looking for more.    I'm glad to see such talented straight actors willing and able to play gay in non-stereotyped roles. And I'm very grateful and surprised that neither man has the gym body that seems to be required in gay entertainment nowadays. It's so refreshing to see bodies that don't look like they've been tortured.    Tina Holmes as always is excellent, and Ross Thomas is very funny and sweet as the brother/best friend. But best of all are Jonah Markowitz's wonderful screenplay and direction. This movie is smart, subtle, immensely entertaining, entirely believable, and never boring, predictable, or depressing. I love it.
B000025XKM|5.0|\\"You can take a road that takes you to the stars, I can take a road that'll see me through\\" - as the lyrics to the beautiful \\"Road\\" ring, you can't help but feel the sadness of \\"Pink Moon\\". Moments of sanguinity and senses of cynical optimism cut through the bleak overtones, but they are ominously tinted by the reality of Drake's impending suicide. Certainly the legacy of a suicidal musician is nothing new, but while half-hearted, self-loathing singer/songwriters, surrounded in their glorification of depression emulate Drake's altar, one must take \\"Pink Moon\\" for what it is - one of the very best folk albums ever made.<br /><br />Throughout the album Drake weaves a master class in acoustic guitar playing, utilising alternative tunings and complex, delicate finger picking, all produced through a wonderfully warm tone. The sound is sparse; unlike \\"Five Leaves Left\\" or \\"Bryter Layter\\" there are no orchestrated sections, nor even a piano in the mix. It is stripped down, raw and lonely. And this acts well to emphasise the stellar writing, especially with such outstanding songs as \\"Things Behind The Sun\\", \\"Pink Moon\\", \\"Road\\" and \\"Free Ride\\", some of the most delicate and haunting music Drake ever created. It is unfortunately a very short album, almost equalling a lengthy EP, and that is my one qualm. It is rightly heralded as one of the greatest folk singer/songwriter albums.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I've always loved Loreena McKennitt's music, and I definitely wasn't disappointed this time.  I think my favorite song on this one is the Seven Rejoices of Mary.  If you want a good CD for Christmas, this is it.  I also recommend To Drive the Cold Winter Away, also by Loreena.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|What a great CD! Not quite as rock as I expected, but still great. Any true David Cook fan will enjoy!
B0014I4KH6|2.0|I bought this CD based on the raving reviews. It's just OK. You hear a couple of songs, you hear them all. Only one song that really stands out is the one she's known for \\"Teardrops on my guitar\\". The rest is pretty much the same. Same beat, same pitch, same style. Unbearable after awhile.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I remember this movie from back in the day, and my little boy loves it as well. Great classic!!
B001GQACGO|4.0|Finally, a Beyonce album that I can appreciate. I think that this one is her best album yet. The ballads were more passionate and real. I could identify with the lyrics. She sounded more mature. She did also manage to incorporate some of her infamous \\"ghetto-fabulous\\" club style cuts. A great ablum, worth the money.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|i had only heard 2 songs off of the cd before purchasing. i bought it as a birthday present for my sister mid-november and she hasn't stopped listening to it yet. i can honestly say i enjoy every single song. the vocals are extraordinary.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook has a unique voice that you will remember when you hear it again.  The more I listen to the CD; the more I like it.  When I heard this \\"rocker\\" sing Music of the Night from Phantom of the Opera, I knew he would go a long way singing any type music.  This Grandma loves to hear David Cook sing.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This version of Miracle on 34th Street is my wife's favorite one.  To her, it doesn't seem like Christmas without watching it at least once and, of course, A Christmas Carol!!  Anyway, this is an enchanting version and it came brand new just as we ordered.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman should have been a recipe for success but Wanted fell flat after the first ten minutes. The story, that of a clueless office drone being recruited to a group of master assassins, is very interesting. The execution, not so much.    A gigantic loom, the Loom of Fate, spins threads and true to the mythology of Fate, a binary code-like interpretation of kinks in the fabric woven by the loom determines who must be assassinated in order to promote the greater good.    Gibson, McAvoy's character, is a pawn being used by the group to eliminate a rogue assassin.    There are twists and turns to this tale, but they're achingly predicatable which totally detracts from the enjoyment of the film. There are too many elements strain one's ability to believe in the film, such as curving a bullet, a wax that can instantly heal people, and almost superhuman powers derived from the ability to control one's autonomic responses.    Jolie is sexy and scary as always, and McAvoy ably portrays the nerd turned expert killer. The film looks gorgeous but the film as a whole left me...wanting.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  I couldn't wait for it to come out and was not disappointed with the movie.  It was a very touching and funny movie.  You really need to look at what is going on in each scene, because some of the background stuff is hilarious.  I could watch this movie over and over.  If is good for anyone to watch.  Can't wait for DVD.
B001ECQ6YW|4.0|I got this for my grandchildren.  Of course, I got the opportunity to watch it with them one afternoon.  I must admit, I was not really looking forward to the experience.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  The artwork and animation is great and while the story line is predictable (it is a kids movie, after all) it was varied enough to keep our interest throughout.  Honestly, it was one of the best movies I've watched this year, much better than some aimed at older audiences. If my grandchildren carry this one off to their house, I'll have to buy myself another copy!
159448385X|5.0|After reading the amazing Kite Runner, I wanted more. However, I didn't have high hopes for this book because it was released only a few short years after Kite Runner. To my surprise, I was floored by this book. It was breathtaking and incredible emotional-- and this is coming from a NON-FICTION reader.<br /><br />Thank you, Khaled Hosseini, for putting my faith back in fiction for me! It's my new fiction mission: fiction with a purpose.<br /><br />Please, do yourself a favor and read this book.
B001ACH4DS|1.0|I watched David Cook advance through the competition on American Idol and saw him progress every week into someone who I thought was a very good rock singer with allot of potential talent and the ability to express his own hard rock edginess while singing famous rock/pop songs. Unfortunately David seems to have forgotten and thrown away most of what he learned during the show. Instead of utilizing some of the best production advice available from the top people in the industry he apparently decided to use his sudden fame to simply produce an album the way he  might have before he became the \\"American Idol\\" star. With the exception of two good songs the result is what sounds like a poorly recorded, poorly written, repetitive, and amateurish attempt at a rock album with a type of sound that is commonly found among the tens of thousands of forgettable semi-professional wanna-be rock stars who seek stardom.    I wish it had been different since I really wanted to like this album and I still believe David Cook has the potential to be a very talented singer/musician. I actually purchased this new album after hearing on the radio one new song that I really liked called \\"Mr. Sensitive\\". The other good song on this album was familiar since it was produced for David to sing on the American Idol show (\\"The Time of My Life\\"). With a few minor deviations the majority of the rest of the songs on this album (with the exception of \\"Permanent\\") all sound like variations of the same song to me. They start out slightly different but the songs end up with the same type of boringly predictable instrumental rock riffs that we have heard thousands of times in other rock songs from the past. Instead of powerful and emotional singing David reverts to what I would call monotonic screaming. Didn't Simon and the other judges and professionals on the show warn the contestants about this time and time again?    To make things worse the actual recording itself lacks dynamic range. This problem isoften the result of using excessively high volume levels during the recording and mixing phases or it is sometimes intentionally done to improve playback on the radio and compressed digital formats (MP3, etc.). Even when it is played on quality stereo equipment it sounds like a compressed MP3 recording. This might be ok on an iPod but it is almost painful to listen to this CD on a higher quality stereo system.     It's too bad that David didn't take this opportunity of American Idol stardom to go in a different direction but like many other albums that former winners and top ten finalists have released this one doesn't cut it. Why? This is just a guess but after the tremendous success of Daughtry's hit rock album (which is the best rock album released so far by any American Idol contestant) the American Idol producers may not have provided enough guidance during the production of David Cook's album. It is possible that their lack of oversight or an expansion of experimental freedom for David during production has resulted in what I believe is a disappointing music album. Like some of the other disappointed fans I can see how this effort could be rated with two or two and one half stars out of five stars. However, as much as I wanted it to succeed I have to be honest by rating this album with only one star which I think more accurately represents the small percentage of the few decent songs out of numerous weak songs.     For those dedicated David Cook fans trying to decide whether to buy this album I would recommend that they listen to it first. I can understand that this album might appeal to some listeners so don't let any single review including this one make up your mind. I would also suggest that before anyone puts too much credibility in any reviews or ratings here that they check to see how many other reviews that person has previously written and how long that person has been writing reviews on Amazon.    I have not given up on this talented American Idol winner and as a fan I wish the very best for his future as a rock musician. I think he could gain the real edge he needs by seeking more advice from the industry professionals who can help him maximize the potential talent we all know is there. If he does accept some advice and move in a different direction then I believe he still has a chance at redemption with his next album release.
0545128285|2.0|I just finished reading the book last night and all I can think of was WHAT WAS ROWLING THINKING when she wrote this book!!? I mean she has kids and should know what is inappropriate for them. This book is definitely NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS! It has pretty gruesome scenes like someone cutting a warlock's throat to steal his wand while he sleeps and a man cutting out his fiancée's heart and then licking the blood on it. I am so glad I read the book first and didn't just blindly give it to my kids to read.
031606792X|5.0|This book was a great read like her other it kept me page turning. I know she said that this was the last book from Bella perceptive but I am hoping  that is not the last I really feel there is room for another......can not wait to see what else she comes up with ;)

0596009208|5.0|I bought this book as a supplement to my text book. This book was was actually fun to read and the way they worded the concepts made them easier to understand. This book does not include every Java concept but does give you the fundamentals. Perfect book for a beginner.
B000YAA68W|5.0|Talking to many Iranians who are about the same age as Marjane, one could realize how natural and honest the Marjane's story is. When the movie 300, which shamelessly lies about history, receives so much attention, it shouldn't be surprising that Persepolis is widely ignored in the US. We should not forget that narrating a story  based on the complex mentality of the people in middle east, is itself an enormous task. Marjane Satrapi and her colleagues did a superb job while accomplishing this task. Persepolis could be considered as a strong response to some Iranian movies made by well-known film makers, whoes ONLY  goal is to be acclaimed in European film festivals. Despite its tragic content, Persepolis manifests resistance and vitality of a suppressed nation.
0385340990|5.0|This book was a very easy read but still well written. My book club read it and everyone liked it. And that is rare! Highly recommended for something that reads quickly and gives you an interesting perspective on life after WW II in Europe.
B001KSJ08Y|5.0|It's a good soundtrack, have been listening to it everyday; at least once, since it was released. I really love the song Kirsten Stewart chose to put in the movie, Iron & Wine \\"Flyless Bird, American Mouth\\", along with \\"I caught Myself\\" by Paramore... Rob Pattison's songs are okay, nothing too great.. he has a nice voice, just need to work on it more, as far as us understanding what he is saying.. lol I really dont, I had to google the lyrics... but wonderful acting Robert Pattison on Twilight, hope they keep you for each movie they release...<br />:)
0312932081|5.0|Ender's Game was first published in August 1977 as a novelette in Analog magazine. Card later expanded that short story into a full-length book, which is now his best known novel. Ender's Game is a vision of the future in which gifted children are used to fight in an adult war against alien invaders. It will challenge your assumptions of reality.<br /><br />While written with YA readers in mind, Ender's Game can be enjoyed by readers of any age from 12 on up. The book is clearly Science Fiction yet is not so technical that it can't be understood easily.  There's enough room to imgaine yourself in Ender's world - which makes this a wonderful escape from the pressures of everyday life. At the end of the story, most readers are hungry for more, which the author has provided. This was the first but is most definitely not the last novel starring Ender and his friends.<br /><br />If you like Science Fiction, this is clearly a book you should read.
031606792X|1.0|OK - So I was a Twilight mom - I read the first three books, saw the movie (which actually wasn't very good) twice, and then bought a \\"Team Edward\\" t-shirt and button.  I've encouraged my son (11) to read the books as vampires and werewolves are right up his alley and so far he is finishing Eclipse and rounding third to New Moon.  Then I started reading Breaking Dawn...what the heck happened?!  First, the fourth book is NOTHING like the first three.  It is almost as if she was writing a totally different story.  The names are the same but they are not the same people.  What made the characters interesting is non-existent in this book.  This story is not romantic and it doesn't have that \\"pull\\" that the first three books had.  Second, I saw an interview with the author where they make a point that the characters did not have sex - well, that changes soon in the fourth book.  I am no shrew, but there were times where I was even shocked and amazed at what was going on.  Bruises?!  Breaking headboards?!  Pregnancy?!  WTF?!  At this point I am trying to come up with a way to tell my son that after reading the first three books he won't be able to read the fourth book until he is 18.  I am warning all of my friends not to let their kids read this book.  Not only does it not seem to fit in with the theme and undertone of the series - which is the Romeo & Juliette-esque theme of forbidden love - but it was completely irresponsible of the author, knowing her fan base is mostly comprised of teenage girls, to wrap up teenage sex, marriage and motherhood in this bright shiny red candy-like wrapper and serve it up to inocent little minds like it was a lollipop.  Even Bella being turned into a vampire was nothing - none of the terrible things that happened to the other vampires when they \\"changed\\" happened to her.  The author might as well have stuck a crack pipe in her mouth and showed that smoking crack doesn't really hurt you, either!  This book upset me on so many levels.  And not only did it shock me and upset me, it didn't even entertain me while doing it.  What was she thinking?!
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I ordered this video from Videos For Less through Amazon.com, paid for it in full but have never received anything. I haven't even gotten a response from either Amazon or Videos for Less about my DVD, or even a refund of my money.

031606792X|5.0|I read all four of the twilight series within a three week period. I could not put them down. If you like romance and you just need feel that you need a little \\"lift\\", then you will love these books. At first I thought it was mostly for young girls.....but I am almost fifty and a romantic at heart so I LOVED THEM. Now I'm buying The Host and looking forward to her fifth twilight book.
143911000X|4.0|I got this for my younger brother who always watches HIMYM w/me.  Barney's comments and antics are so funny - when I saw this book I HAD to get it for him.  It's a Christmas present, so I don't know what his reaction will be, but I skimmed it and it's hysterical!
B001N44BVQ|4.0|\\"Body of Lies\\" is a taut, riveting thriller that weaves a tale of terrorism, espionage, and betrayal amid the current landscape of violence and retribution in the Middle East. The film is based on the novel by David Ignatius.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio continues to prove that he's got the acting chops and is believable in action films. Here he plays Roger Ferris, a CIA operative working to track down a bin Ladenesque terrorist named Al-Saleem. Al-Saleem's trail leads Ferris to Jordan, where he must balance working with and between his CIA handler (played with relish by an overweight, aged Russell Crowe) and the head of Jordanian intelligence (brilliantly played by Mark Strong), who are working at crosspurposes with each other. Ferris further complicates his mission by falling for an Iranian nurse (played by Golshifteh Farahani).<br /><br />The movie uses wild technology, lies and counterlies, torture, and Ferris' growing disdain with the intelligence community. Some of the movie seems quite fanciful, and maybe it is, but except for a couple of places, it holds up as a brutually honest thriller.<br /><br />\\"Body of Lies\\" isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be. It's fiction. Some may find it unbelievable, but it's a movie, and that means it doesn't have to get everything right. It just has to entertain, and it certainly does.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Wow! This is a super CD. I like his voice specially when he hits the high notes. Songs are very mature. Pure entertainment. Best songs are: Declaration (LOVE THAT SONG!), Heroes (very nice!), Avalanche (Great!) and Light On. Another cool songs are Bar-ba-sol and I did it for you. Wow...I like almost all the songs. Great beginning! Hope he keeps a good track!
B001KO3FFW|5.0|Been waiting for his album to come out, and is here at last. Wow...Light on, heroes, lie and a daily anthem are my favorite songs. These songs ROCK! He captured southern rock flavor, of which in my opinion, is the perfect fit for his voice. Love It...If you love David on Idol, you'd love his album.....Keep the excelent work going!!!!!!
B0002JP4L4|5.0|I'm not giving this movie 5 stars because of the movie.  Let's face it, it's 'Footloose' for heavens sake.  BUT it is one of those really great/crappy all in 1 80's movies that we've come to know and love.  And if can't watch this and come away comepletely loving Kevin Bacon, then there's something wrong with you ;)    All in all, DVD features are geat, movie is restored well. Great purchase, very well done!
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Sure it's silly, schmaltzy, shallow, ridiculous, but that's exactly what it's supposed to be!  Mamma Mia is a fun, colorful musical that's aimed squarely at those who have the guilty pleasure of enjoying ABBA music.  I didn't know what to expect when I began watching this film but I soon found myself grinning and singing through the whole thing.  Does anyone really expect a musical such as this one to offer a deep plot and profound social commentary?  The movie is simply meant to be fun and entertaining!  It succeeds!    The cinematography is great, the choreography is good, the girls are gorgeous, Pierce Brosnan's singing is painful but that's part of the fun.  ABBA's Benny and Bjorn produced the movie so it's got to be faithful to the ABBA spirit.  However stupid and silly it all may be, it works for me!

B001EO2UKO|4.0|Let me start with that I'm a huge fan of Dido's. I have her two previous albums, two imports and branched out into Faithless because of her vocals. I love her song writing and her voice moves me.    With that said, I have a hard time entering into 'Safe Trip Home.' The problem is mine, I suspect. I'm at a happy point in my life. I'm getting ready to ask my girlfriend to marry me and things couldn't be better. I'm far removed from the emotional entry point of this CD.    I have listened to it once, all the way through and then put it on the shelf. I may listen to it again in a couple weeks (or months), but mainly, I'm holding on to it like an insurance policy. I would like it to be there in case grief strikes in the future. I know that may sound a little weird, but don't we all have albums that we turn to when we're feeling a certain way?    I guess I never thought Dido would headline my sorrow, sadness, and melancholy section. Alas, I am sorry for her loss.    ...If you like Dido and want to continue to support her music, perhaps you could buy some of her other merchandise (the Dido Live DVD is awesome) if you don't want this album?

B000W9DTG6|5.0|This boxed set the best thing I've bought from Amazon.com to date.  I love the Ocean movies for their star-studded cast, the amazing humour, and the hundreds of other things that make these movies unique.  The extras aren't all that great, but I usually buy movies for the actual movie, not the extras...  So if a lack of stunning special features doesn't bother you, and you don't have the movies already, you should definitely get this set.  Easily worth 5-stars in my book.

0060763280|4.0|This book is an outgrowth of the nineteenth-century science of mind idea that thoughts are things: \\"What mind can conceive, man can achieve.\\" This is now known as the law of attraction (like attracts like). Control your thoughts to control your destiny. This book should appeal to those who believe in the law of attraction who are comfortable with prayer and affirmations who wish to improve their finances and overcome negative or counterproductive programming or conditioning surrounding money. The author says that only poor people say that money is not important. Money is very important, he argues, in all the areas in which money applies, although completely unimportant in the areas in which it does not apply; to say that love is more important may be true, but it is irrelevant!    Start by identifying your financial tapes: the programming absorbed from your parents. These set your \\"financial thermostat\\" to a certain income level. To increase your income and your net worth, you need to reset your financial thermostat. To do this, you must stop identifying with old tapes (sour grapes of the have-nots, derogatory attitudes about rich people, etc.), which keep you from feeling good about doing better financially. Many of our unconscious financial tapes do not serve us. Learn to reprogram yourself to be wired for success and prosperity. The author supplies affirmations for prosperity consciousness and techniques: stand in front of a mirror, hold your hand over your heart, and say the affirmation out loud, then touch your forehead with your index finger and say, \\"I have millionaire mind.\\"    The author, in addition to his pop psychology about prosperity consciousness (which he calls \\"millionaire mind\\") provides pop sociology concerning how rich people think, how middle-class people think, and how poor people think. These general, broad-brush characterizations seem accurate: middle-class people focus on income, for instance; rich people focus on net worth. Poor people think of the short term; rich people think of the long term. Middle-class people value security; rich people value freedom. Poor people want to survive. Middle-class people want to be comfortable. Rich people want financial freedom, wealth, and abundance, and they are willing to make sacrifices to achieve their goals. (Poor people only want to be rich or dream about it, but they are not willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal.) This should be familiar to the student of intellectual history from early twentieth-century popular writers who asked, \\"Do you sincerely wish to be rich?\\" These ideas are not new, just repackaged (quite profitably).     People's reaction to this book will be governed by their receptivity to (or resistance to) self-help books, pop psychology, motivational speakers and ideas, and New Age presentations of the law of attraction. The people who are looking for a book about types of investments and how to invest their money will be disappointed; to them, this book may seem like superficial pop-psychological nonsense.
0143144006|4.0|I checked this audiobook out of the library; it's one of several about the brain that I've \\"read\\" lately in the car.  This is a very valuable book, primarily for the insights it provides into what having a stroke can be like and what sorts of caregiving can be especially helpful.  Unfortunately, the book is also quite repetitive; at times I thought I might have stuck in the wrong CD by mistake, because I was sure I'd heard the same thing before--but no.  The worst thing about this particular version of the book, though, is the reader, who is also the author.  I don't know why the publisher allowed someone who wasn't an actor or a particularly skilled reader to do the audiobook--perhaps to show how much the author had recovered from her stroke.  But listening to her relatively emotionless, flat delivery hour after hour really grated on me.  True, I could have returned the audiobook and put a hold on the regular copy--but I would have had to wait a lot longer.  In retrospect, though, that's what I should have done, because the reading bothered me the entire time, and this really is a good, worthwhile book.  If it weren't for the reader and the repetitiousness, I'd give it 5 stars--very absorbing (and inspiring) reading for anyone interested in the brain, strokes, or caregiving.

B0009P42S2|4.0|Steamboy is a film directed and co-written by Katsuhiro Otomo.  The film was in production for ten years and utilized more than 180,000 drawings and 440 CG cuts.  With a production cost of $26,000,000, Steamboy is the most expensive full length Japanese animated movie produced to date.<br /><br />The animation in Steamboy is very well done, and the viewer can tell that a lot of time was taken to produce the film.  As you watch, you can also see how torn Ray is when he's having to decide whether to help his father or his grandfather.  A viewer can also tell that an alternate history was utilized.  While steam is the main source of power, there are some elements of the technology utilized that either wouldn't have existed yet, or progressed faster than they did in our timeline.<br /><br />This DVD release of Steamboy contains several special features, and on the special features menu, they are split out into: Featurettes, Animation Onion Skins, Production Drawings, and Previews.  Under \\"Featurettes,\\" there are a total of four items included.  The first is an almost nineteen-minute documentary about producing the English dub of Steamboy, which includes interviews with some of the voice actors and some of the crew members involved with the dub.  Next is a five-minute interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo.  Otomo is speaking in Japanese, but instead of putting subtitles on the bottom of the screen, an American voice-over is dubbed over Otomo's voice.  Personally, I found this rather annoying.  Next is a \\"Multi-Screen Landscape Study,\\" which is a nineteen-minute piece that aired on three screens at a Steamboy exhibition.  Here, subtitles are utilized to translate the spoken Japanese.  \\"The Adventure Continues\\" is a textless version of the ending credits, which serve as a kind of epilogue for the film.<br /><br />The \\"Animation Onion Skins\\" runs for about four-and-a-half minutes, and shows the various developmental stages of five scenes (which shows everything from rough animation to final scenes).  \\"Production Drawings\\" runs for almost six minutes, and it shows paintings that had been done as the sets were developed.  The \\"Previews\\" menu includes several previews of both anime and non-anime releases from the studio that released Steamboy.<br /><br />Overall, Steamboy is a great film.  It's one I would recommend to anime fans that are thirteen years of age and older.es).  \\"Production Drawings\\" runs for almost six minutes, and it shows paintings that had been done as the sets were developed.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|I got this only knowing 2 songs.  After listening to this album I have to be honest, all the songs are good and you will want to listen to them more than once. I was never a P!nk fan until this album.  I would recommend it to anyone.

B001I189MQ|5.0|I took my kids to see this when it came out in theatre.  Not just because it was Heath Ledger's last movie, or because it was another Batman movie, but because it was the sequel to an equally great movie, Batman Begins.  After I sat and watched the first one with my kids one night at home, I couldn't wait for the sequel to come out.  It followed so masterfully from the first movie into the second one and Dark Knight ended with what you know will be another 1st class sequel.<br /><br />Christian Bale is probably now my favorite Batman character of all of the previous ones.  I've seen him in several other movies and have become a big fan anyways, but he really does a great job in these two movies.<br /><br />Enough has been said about Heath and what this movie did to him, but I loved him long before Dark Knight.  I fell in love with him in The Patriot, alongside Mel Gibson, and laughed at his silly and courageous antics in A Knights Tale.  And no matter what was thought or said about the content of the movie, I absolutely adored him in Brokeback Mountain.  It was directed well, superbly acted, and truly showed a friendship between two men.  Heath Ledger was a wonderful person, great actor, and I will dearly miss seeing him on the big screen.<br /><br />The remaining actors they chose for the first one and this sequel were excellent choices: Michael Caine, Eric Roberts, Gary Oldman, and of course Maggie Gylenhall, only to name a few of my faves.  Maggie replaced her predecessor very well in this flick and honestly, I liked her portrayal of Rachael better.<br /><br />Probably the other thing I agree with on other reviews is don't waste your money on the 2-Disc version.  My son bought this, so it was what he wanted.  I was happy watching the movie and the quality is excellent, but the 2nd disc didn't have much more than I could have found online.<br /><br />My Suggestion:  DON'T MISS THIS ONE!
0525478183|5.0|John Green's writing is kind of like his main character Quentin in Paper Towns: even when it's flawed, it's immensely likable. And truth be told, it's not often flawed.<br /><br />I think I read part of a review of this book that said that the other key character, Margo Roth Spiegelman, isn't sufficiently dimensional. Considering Margo herself ends up worrying about her own dimensionality as a human being, this is a bit ironic. But irony suits Margo, and Quentin, and John Green himself.<br /><br />In Paper Towns, the larger-than-life girl next door climbs in Q's window in the middle of the night and swiftly convinces him to go out on a wild adventure focusing on revenge, yet notable for its creativity and flamboyance: As Q puts it in his head, a tad sarcastically, \\"Oh, we're just scattering some dead fish about town, breaking some windows, photographing naked guys, hanging out skyscraper lobbies at three-fifteen in the morning, that kind of thing.\\"<br /><br />Then Margo runs away from home, leaving serious Quentin to worry about her wellbeing. Turns out Margo has run away before, and she always leaves clues, so Q sets out on a sort of treasure hunt to try to track Margo down, sure that she wants him to find her. He is aided and abetted by three old friends and a new one.<br /><br />John Green's writing is in turns funny (very, very funny, in fact!) and introspective--his dialogue in particular leaves most YA writers in the dust. I'm not sure teens like this exist, but I'd like to think they do. Green even manages to work Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass into the plot, as well as allusions to Captain Ahab and other literary figures; and it works.<br /><br />The best thing about this story is how looking for Margo becomes a way for Quentin to come out of his shell, or come into his own, or something best described in less clich&eacute; terms. Q isn't the one-dimensional scaredy-cat Margo thought he was any more than she's the one-dimensional super-girl he thought she was. Green's metaphor about paper towns evolves with his story--paper towns don't exist, but they could. Just as there must be some version of Q and of Margo that isn't necessarily known, but is nevertheless possible.<br /><br />For parents who worry about this sort of thing, Paper Towns is definitely a YA book, with some profanity and a certain amount of chatter about body parts, sex, and getting drunk (also some actual drinking, though it isn't pretty!). However, it is also a book that manages to be both witty and poignant, which isn't an easy combination to pull off. And since YA fiction often seems to be dominated by strong female narrators, it's great to read a book that is by, for, and about a guy.with his story--paper towns don't exist, but they could.

B001L7NWQA|4.0|This is a really enjoyable album as Paul's bass bubbles in and out of every cut.  I applaud his ability to still pull off some hard rocking sounds like the first and last tracks.  Some of the songs have a familiar riff but with a slight twist.  He's keeping it pretty fresh in my opinion.
B00000AOUD|5.0|... I can't either. I hate it. The majority of prog rock was either written by individuals who were high on themselves or something else.     Thick as a Brick is not progressive like you might typically think. It is something else altogether, a symphony for rockers, so to speak. Tull sounds like nobody else, that's for sure. Unlike Floyd or the Who, thier primary sound is organic rather ten electric, yet they still manage to have an awesome groove.    When I was little (I'm 18 now), my parent had this album and let me play it on the record player. I was six years old, I think it got played more because of it's unique cover originally, but after growing up with this album I realize its true beauty. It's many different songs, each within one continuous thought. Buy this!!
B001N4RORE|2.0|The reason that I have such a firm dislike to this particular DVD is that I am an ABBA fan. I have every vinyl...first cut vinyl...that they have ever done. I have ticket stubs, plane ticket receipt, and hotel receipts for ever tour that they have done.   I am not a purist. The contrivance of this particular use of their material is pretty good on the stage. They just did not translate the material well. Whether it was the London Stage, New York Stage or the ABBA road show, they had better voice and acting talents.  I saw this dog (I apologize for insulting any dog. It is just that the appelation works in general.) via Netflix. It is a good tool to weed out movies like this. Stick with the DVD/CD's of any other stage performance. Save your money until the dog becomes so cheap as to maybe rate having it as an addition to the collection.
B000MGUZKM|5.0|I must say I never really new much about Randy Crawford or Joe Sample, but the reviews were so good here I decided to give it a try (I like to expose myself to new artists/genres regularly). WOW!! This album is amazing, refreshing. Beautiful arrangements, and Randy's voice is thrilling. I listened to \\"When I Need You\\" and tears sprang into my eyes - you can feel the emotion in her voice spilling out. I highly recommend this CD.
006051048X|4.0|Coraline is great and I would recommend buying the audio version, but stay away from Audible, Amazon.com's \\"trusted partner\\" in audio books. It requires the installation of software to even download the audio file and if you want to play it on your PC, don't even think about using your favorite media player. Compare this to songs bought and downloaded off Amazon.com itself which are DRM free and in MP3 format. (Note: Good job with that Amazon). Even iTunes, which I normally shun, may have been better.  An advantage theoretically would be that it can be transferred to any MP3 player, but guess what, doesn't work on my Creative MP3 player despite advertising that it does. What a surprise.  Bottom line: Good sound quality, the actual product is perfect, but the delivery is distasteful if you like having an MP3 format and nobody constantly looking over your shoulder, buy the CD. I would give Coraline 5/5, Audible 1/5. Regretting the purchase from Audible, I must admit.
B0000024ZT|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's very first album is probably his best album from the 70's.  The songwriting is fairly good, the lyrics are interesting (and the kind of lyrics you may be able to relate to if you happen to live in the New Jersey/New York area) and the moody tone of the entire album is pretty delightful.  It has that dark singer-songwriter vibe like the album was recorded in an empty room, and alone.  I get that same vibe from Nick Drake's music.      The Bob Dylan's imitations are noticeable though, but Bruce does manage to give his music a unique style despite that, thanks to his distinct voice and his lyrics that are MUCH different from the stuff Dylan was doing.  I give this album a better rating than the rest of Springsteen's 70's albums because the songs contain a fair amount of melody.      I prefer this version of \\"Blinded by the Light\\" by FAR over the Manfred Mann's Earth Band version (despite being a much bigger Manfred Mann fan).   Maybe it's because Manfred Mann's version has been played WAY too many times over the years, or maybe I just prefer the funky/jazzy style of Springsteen's version.  I don't really know.    \\"Growin' Up\\" is a song just about everyone likes.  The vocals are really catchy and feel nostalgic, that's why.  My favorite song on the album, and perhaps favorite song by Springsteen, is \\"Lost in the Flood\\".  VERY powerful lyrics.  I love this one a lot.   I also really admire \\"It's Hard to be a Saint in the City\\" and \\"Spirit in the Night\\" (the latter reminding me of Van Morrison with the jazzy horns).    \\"The Angel\\" has a pretty and tender melody as well.  \\"Does this Bus Stop at 82nd Street?\\" is the most underrated song on the album.      Overall, a very good album you need to own.
B00000255F|4.0|This has become Bruce Springsteen's most popular album, and for good reason- the songwriting is very good this time around, and immediately enjoyable for most people.  This is one of those albums that people listen to and remember exactly where they were when they first heard these songs.<br /><br />Some of these songs blow me away completely and make me fully aware just how talented the Boss is, such as \\"She's the One\\" and \\"Jungleland\\".  Love those tunes.<br /><br />Classic rock radio actually doesn't play those songs as much as you'd think- instead they choose to stick with the title track and \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\" and ignore pretty much the rest of the album.  Of course that's wrong, but we can't do anything about it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Bruce was obviously going for some kind of deliberate loud and explosive bombastic sound while making these songs, and sometimes that's a turn off to me personally because the songs end up sounding like some kind of stage show.  Bruce Springsteen is no Abba!<br /><br />Other than that, the quality of the songwriting is very good.  And you know, I've never noticed it before, but Bruce's voice resembles Elvis Presley a little bit when he lets it shake.  That's pretty cool.
0956010903|4.0|Anxiously anticipating this book for several months, I was very eager to start reading when my copy came in.<br />I was taken aback and aghast when I opened it, looking down upon the beautifully crafted book, complete with cloth bag and prints.  I was very proud to be some of the few who have ordered this masterpiece.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the only concern I have with the book (hence, the four stars) is that I feel the book could've been done...how shall I say it?  Better.<br />The pages were my main concern.  Yes, they were made from an extremely durable material, but if it's going to stay close to the Harry Potter world, I would've expected bond paper with torn edges (my favorite kind of reading paper).  And for a $100.00, I'm sure they could've easily lowered the price and still made a profit for Children's Higher Learning.<br /><br />But other than the actual product, I thoroughly enjoyed the stories.  I can't say that I have a favorite, because they are all well told in their own individual respect.  The final story was very familiar, as I heard it before in Deathly Hallows, but I'm sure everyone had a wonderful time rereading it in the actual The Tales of Beedle the Bard.<br /><br />A must-have for any Harry Potter fan (and $100.00 to blow).

B000002ADT|5.0|Potential purchasers of Kind of Blue will find (at the time of this writing) nearly 700 reviews of this reissue at amazon.com.  The 5-star reviews have it right.  Actually, any reissue, or the original vinyl release should receive 5 stars.  The pitch correction does help on this particular release, though.  Kind of Blue is a classic for several reasons.  There is an incredible disparity of style (maybe \\"range\\" of style is a better way to put it) between the wind players.  Just compare Davis's solo on \\"So What\\" with those of Adderley and Coltrane -- it's like they are in entirely different worlds.  What tends to lead to this stylistic range is the harmonic and scalar nature of the pieces.  Gone are the fast, complicated chord progressions of bop.  Replacing them are modality, at times harmonic minimalism, and references to the blues.  A read of Kahn's or Nisenson's books on the making of this album tends to give the impression that it became a classic in spite of itself.  But, what else can you call an album that is thoroughly accessible, yet at times cutting edge, and one with so much outstanding playing from the entire group?

If there's a problem, she can quickly identify solutions, come up with alternatives, and implement them.  When little mistakes and lapses can no longer be managed, Alice seeks medical help (it must be fatigue, it must be menopause) and discovers that there will be no solutions or alternatives to implement.<br /><br />What comes next is the hardest part -- she knows she is losing her grasp, she knows when she has embarassed herself professionally, and she is fully cognizant of every loss of dignity and independence.  She has a plan to deal with her final days, but even that choice slips away.<br /><br />In fact, this is the horrible warning to the rest of us.  By the time the diagnosis is reached, the options for handling end-of-life issues are narrowed and the ability to process the decision-making required to make those choices is rapidly disappearing.<br /><br />By the end, the burden is no longer so much on Alice.

0385751893|5.0|Nine-year-old Bruno lives an idyllic life with his mother, father and his older sister Gretel in Berlin, Germany. He attends school, plays with his best friends, argues with his sister and must eat at the fancy dinners prepared for special guests, such as the Fury (Führer). His dream world is threatened when he learns that his father takes a job faraway and he thinks it best that his family join him. No one is particularly happy about the move, but decide to make the best of the situation. Bruno is the only one who openly opposes it and voices his complaints to his father. However, the go ahead with their plans.   When they arrive and take possession of the new house, Bruno makes all kinds of new discoveries. He learns that they live in a place called Out-with (Auschwitz), because the ones who owned the house prior to them were forced to leave (Out with the old and in with the new). One of their new servants who serves them dinner used to be a doctor, but is reluctant in talking about why he changed occupations. Bruno also realizes that there are no other families or children in the area.  But Bruno's biggest discovery is from his own bedroom window. From there he can spy on this little town, which is cut off from the rest of the world due to a barbed wire perimeter. The people there are dressed in striped pajamas and are forbidden to leave their little town. Eventually while he is exploring, he happens upon the camp and even meets a boy named Shmuel who shares a birthday with him. Unlike the other friendships he's had in the past, Bruno's friendship with Shmuel is different. Because of the barbed wires they cannot play together, so they spend most of their time talking about their lives.Shmuel agrees to bring an extra set of pajamas for Bruno to wear, that way he can come over to his side of the wire. Since Bruno recently contracted lice and had his head shaved, he would look like ever other child there.   The next day he visits, Shmuel is upset because his fatherwent missing. So Bruno crawls underneath the wire and changes into the pajamas, then proceeds to help Shmuel search for his father.   While Bruno is there, he and Shmuel and several others are selected to go off on a march. The selected few are led to an underground bunker and once the door is closed on them, it is pitch black. In the end, Bruno tells Shmuel that he is his best friend.   Even if you're not a holocaust expert, you can imagine where Bruno and Shmuel ended up.At the end of the book, there is a note from the author explaining why he wrote this book and even admits that while the story is told from a nine-year-old point of view, this book is not for children. Maybe I'll be criticized for this, but I disagree. I think with some parental supervision, \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is a good introduction to the holocaust. Of course it also depends on the child. If the child is highly sensitive, then no, this is not the book for them. But considering we live in a world with kids watching Jurassic Park and Harry Potter movies, I think this one is fairly mild. I can't wait until I can see the movie to compare the two.
0316017922|3.0|Gladwell's mode of operation deserves a dust-up. Sloppily re-packaging what Psychologists (e.g. Simonton) have known for a long time and then taking credit for it won't cut it much longer.     Having said that, this is an entertaining read, perhaps moreso then the first two books.

Overacting would say \\"Damn, Robin Williams overacted in this movie\\".<br /><br />There is way too much script, line after line after line of Blah, Blah, Blah! The scenery will change and then more Blah, Blah, Blah occurs!<br /><br />The critics are so into this movie and it looked neat on the previews, so I unfortunately wasted my money renting it.<br /><br />Buy it only if you intend to smash it with a sledgehammer.

B001MNFOIW|5.0|If you want a simple, straightforward action adventure movie, look no further.<br /><br />Great production values, good acting, lots of shooting and explosions, and a car chase to rival anything done before (no kidding!).<br /><br />Understand, this is a sort of a comic book on steroids, so you'll only get a little character development. You won't get any deep or complex thoughts, or any difficult to understand plots (while there's one plot twist, it's pretty easy to see coming, and it's an homage to a plot twist in Star Wars, so it'll be familiar when it shows up).<br /><br />Overall, this is slick, fast, and brilliantly executed. The lead character did a nice job of moving from nerdy and repressed to the king of killers, but that's the only character development in the entire movie, and it's the core of the movie.<br /><br />A quick summary: the band of super assassins must train a wet behind the ears kid to be the perfect killer. He has the personality of Caspar Milquetoast, and is afraid of his own shadow, so their work is cut out for them. They use a sort of Zen training coupled with beating the living heck out of him, which is a very effective training technique in comic books and action movies (hey, they almost had enough training scenes for a good montage!).<br /><br />Ultimately the kid comes into his own (kinda like Luke Skywalker) and justice or something like it triumphs. With lots of gunshots, explosions, and time-bombed rats with wristwatches tied on them like fashion belts (I'm not making this up!).<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is perfect as the action heroine with a deeply hidden heart of gold, and James McAvoy who plays the lead was magnificent as nerd/sortofsuperhero.<br /><br />If you like action movies, this is your cup of tea, and you'll love it.<br /><br />If you like psychological drama, or escapist fantasy with philosophical overtones, you really want to go elsewhere.
0553582038|5.0|I am not going to argue - Feast is the weakest of the four books. I think almost every negative review makes fair points about it - the wordiness, the lack of action, the lack of characters we care about (yes, we know, they are returning in part V). I also think, comparing to good 90% of fantasy coming out these days, this book still feels strong, even if not like GoT/SoS/CoK.   There is plenty to enjoy within. The Kingsmoot makes all of Iron Isle chapters worthwhile. Jaime chapters, while not as good as part III's are necessary - Jaime needed that quiet time. Cercei is fun - we've never got into her head before and she is the sort of character holds within much  more than she shows. Brienne cliffhanger is, well, lame, but witnessing the wartorn land through her eyes, leading to Stoneheart's outlaws is a trip worth your time.  Call me Martin fanboy. I don't care. Good Martin, bad Martin, the bar he's set won't be beaten in awhile.
B001E1DJD4|3.0|Artists like Rachael Yamagata are rare. When her \\"Happenstance\\" came out, I readily compared her to Fiona Apple (which should generally be a huge compliment for anyone). However, over the course of the last few years, her self-imposed hibernation seemed to suggest that she was working on something vital and interesting, but the sad truth is that this double-CD is but a pale imitation of its predecessor, and not even in a good way.<br /><br />While \\"Elephants\\" contains the same acoustic-indie numbers with a folk-rock edge that made \\"Happenstance\\" such a winner, its also a more subdued and badly produced record. Seriously, the instrumentation on this one is quite bad, and the recording sounds very disjointed for some reason (listen to it and you'll know what I mean). I'm not sure if this a problem with the mastering or if its intended, but either way I wasn't very impressed at all.<br /><br />The other major problem I have are with the lyrics. While her last album seemed to indicate a woman with a piercing world view and an interesting view of human relationships, this album seems more dry and straight-forward. Which is fine, but the problem remains that she isn't telling us anything here that musicians such as Ani DiFranco or Regina Spektor already have on their many varied albums (they are also two much better recording artists, Im afraid to say).<br /><br />\\"Elephants\\" is also very samey-sounding. I think the title track on Disc 1 is actually the worst as it sets the tone for the whole listening experience. I believe the opening track of any CD should be killer (remember how \\"Sleep to Dream\\" literally MADE Fiona's \\"Tidal\\"?). No such luck here, as by the time you get to Disc 2 (you must listen to the pathetic \\"Pause the Tragic Ending\\"), it seems as if Yamagata has been reduced to a pseudo-philosophical high school student with stars in her eyes. At least, thats what her boring lyrics suggest.<br /><br />The upside is that this is music you can play and leave on in the background - but as a listening experience, its definitely very mediocre and substandard.

061891868X|5.0|In this book, physicist Lee Smolin discusses the current state of knowledge in physics, reviewing how discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries have largely ground to a halt.  Now, a large portion of the field has become absorbed with \\"string theory,\\" which purports to explain and unify the areas of Newtonian mechanics, relativity, and quantum physics.  However, as the author points out, it is not even a \\"theory\\" in that it doesn't provide any testable hypotheses for experiment.  Instead, string theory is in danger of becoming a modern-day cargo cult, wherein someday we will get all our answers and all we need, in the future, so we have to \\"trust\\" it.<br /><br />The author reviews the discoveries of physics and five unanswered questions that remain.  He then reviews the history and development of string theory, and how it is deficient.  He describes several other areas of study in physics which have potential to provide breakthroughs in knowledge, if enough study were devoted.  The concluding chapters then review the sociology of science and academia, and how string theorists are in danger of manifesting tendencies of \\"groupthink\\" and peer pressure that stifle work in any area other than string theory.<br /><br />Whether string theory proves to be valid or not, this book may be considered historic in that it can help to focus the issues for both sides, and helpfully point out neglected approaches that may provide breakthroughs akin to those of Einstein, Newton, and the other \\"greats\\" of physics.<br /><br />I found the author's discussion of academia to be interesting, as he describes why many undergraduate physics majors lose interest and drop out of the field.  I too, was once an undergrate physics major who dropped out for another field of study.  I had read extensively about Einstein, relativity, quantum physics, etc. but was unable to master deriving equations for the first-year Newtonian force diagrams.  So for me this was an interesting section, to see that I was not alone in my experience, and that many other potential \\"seers\\" with new insights in physics were mediocre at math (like Einstein).  Maybe I wasn't such a failure after all... :-)erience, and that many other potential \\"seers\\" with new insights in physics were mediocre at math (like Einstein).

Everything we do all the time involves decisions between choices(get out of bed or sleep in...) and being aware of some of the things that effect those decisions can only be helpful. And how many of the things we just take for granted or assume, it turns out that when they do studies to see if it is true, well, our assumptions are wrong.      And I have been overwhelmed when I try to buy band-aids and I really believe one of the main points, our lives are not improved by 15 or 20 types of bandaids.  I like having more than the one or two you got when I was a kid, but 5 choices would be enough...

B000NVIXFK|5.0|All I can say is that SNAKES AND ARROWS completely blew me away when I heard it. I hadn't paid any attention to Rush for probably 20 years, but after seeing a few positive reviews, I figured I would check this record out just for old time's sake. The record struck me as a little odd the first time I listened to it but by the third go-round I was hooked.    Well, that's not exactly true....I liked \\"Far Cry\\" immediately. It's one of Rush's best openers, full of energy and raw power and emotion. In many ways it speaks to the frustrations and fears that we all feel as we live out our lives (\\"it's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit\\"). It also speaks to the fact that we all find ways to persevere (\\"I can get back on\\"). In as much, \\"Far Cry\\" sets the tone for the rest of the record. It won't be an easy ride (these are certainly among Peart's darkest lyrics) but it will be worth it.     And yes, it's worth it.     The first half of the CD contains the big hitters, the anthems. If you're looking for a prog work-out look no further than \\"Armor and Sword,\\" which is a bit plodding (but, hey, it's a progressive piece), but still kicks enough butt to work. It's theme is one that Peart will re-visit several time throughout the record; that faith can be bastardized to the point that it becomes a source of evil (the sword) rather than good (the armor). It's a bit heavy-handed, but so wasn't stuff like \\"Free Will\\" and 2112. \\"Working Them Angels\\" is a bit more personal, more of an extension of \\"Ghost Rider\\" from VAPOR TRAILS. \\"The Larger Bowl\\" is reminiscent of \\"Half the World\\" from T4E with its themes of inequality but it's better. The guitar solo on this is just fantastic (as is all of Lifeson's guitar work on the record), if a bit too short. This leads into \\"Spindrift,\\" which is about as ominous a song as Rush has ever created. My take on the song is that it is about the culture clashes that are inevitable in an age of globalization.     \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" lightens things up a bit. It is an instrumental that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as both \\"YYZ\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato.\\" \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" closes out the first half of the record in fine form. It has a little of everything. The intro is reminiscent of Cream, there are some fine riffs in the verses, and the chorus has an almost folksy feel. Somehow the shifts in dynamics that this implies work quite well. Again, the theme is dark, reminiscent of \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" on VAPOR TRAILS.    The songs in the second half of the record are a bit more modest in scope, but taken as a whole they pack a real punch. It kicks off with \\"Hope,\\" which is a lovely short acoustic instrumental featuring a solo Lifeson. It leads off what must be seen as a suite of songs dealing with perseverance in the face of the obstacles presented in the first half of the record. \\"Faithless\\" is a real highlight and has become one of my favorite Rush songs. In many ways it can be seen as a companion piece to \\"Free Will,\\" but it is better constructed and because it is a personal testament on Peart's part, it has a bigger impact. \\"Bravest Face\\" is another fine song which reprises some of the issues brought up in \\"The Larger Bowl.\\" Sure it's pessimistic, but it still has some great moments. I especially like the acoustic guitar in the verses and Lifeson's guitar solo, which is so tasteful. Somewhere along the way he learned restraint. It suits the songs here.    After the second chorus of \\"Good News First\\" I was all set to give up on the song. The verses were good (especially Geddy's vocals), but the choruses kept building and never climaxing. Then the bridge swooped in. To my ears it is really stunning. It simply saves the song. After that we have \\"Malignant Narcissism,\\" which is basically just Rush goofing around and having fun, which is great to hear. It's another exemplary instrumental. The album closes with \\"We Hold On\\" which neatly sums up the perseverance theme. It closes the album on just the right note. Plus it provides another showcase for Lifeson.    It's not common for bands to reach a peak artistically after being together for 33 years, but apparently Rush has managed it. MOVING PICTURES may forever be considered Rush's classic, but SNAKES AND ARROWS is right up there with it. In many ways, it is a superior record. Either way, it is an essential recording from one of rock's most under-appreciated bands.
0316067601|5.0|What can I say about this book...  To put it in perfect written word would be impossible, I'm sure just like this book was written.      Marcus Luttrell, a true American Patriot...    I've always had a true passion and respect for our Armed Forces, but I connected with this book, the constant struggle to be the best and in the end the struggle to survive, Marcus lived a life time in less then 6 years as a Navy Seal.  I will always remember this story and the men he fought with,  Petty Officer Matt Axelson, Lieutenant Michael Murphy and Petty Officer Danny Dietz.  I felt like I knew these guys, I cried with Marcus, and I will never forget this true story.    God bless America and God bless you Marcus!!
0316017922|4.0|Outliers raises the questions: Who succeeds beyond their wildest imaginations, why, and for the other aspirants who don't, why not?   It's the second part that distinguishes Gladwell as a cultural journalist, since we are bathed in a constant downpour of winner-worship by the mass media.   The understated theme of this book is that we shouldn't give so much credit to the winners themselves, but rather to the challenging and supportive environments that shaped their drive and talent.   The point of the book is that we currently underdevelop human talent by tolerating \\"winnowing out\\" processes that are arbitrary, unconsciously biased, premature and overselective.    Where I thought the book could have gone further was in tackling the issue of nurturing \\"bandwidth\\".   The unevenness of opportunity reflects an expedient allocation of finite attentional resources on the part of parents, teachers, coaches, bosses, TV producers, journalists....and other sprinklers of mojo on youth.   The anecdotes in the book do a good job of pinning down critical incidents where these mentoring advantages are struck (e.g., when Bill Hewlett gives Steve Jobs surplus HP electronic parts).   Qualitatively, these events are the pivot points that lift up high-achievers.   But quantitatively, is it realistic to assume that there are untapped reserves of youth development capacity waiting to be unleashed?  By merely changing attitudes about how capriciously opportunity is doled out?        The conclusion I drew after reading this book is that Gladwell believes a culture of high-achievement for the few can be transformed into one for the many, not overnight, but gradually as people become more self-aware about how the \\"fairy dust\\" of inspiration and high-expectations is doled out.   Obviously, way too many young spirits are crushed by parents who haphazardly pass along a culture of low-achievement in the way they deal with setbacks by giving up.   None of us get to choose our parents.       As anexploration in cultural  journalism, the willingness to dig down and study \\"also rans\\" to better sort out the role of luck vs. virtue is smart and courageous.  It uncovers to the essential question we need to answer to  evolve our economic system -- how to keep rewards finely-tuned to the virtues of risk-taking and hard work, while discounting lucky breaks and \\"entitlement\\".   In the realm of family advantage, this translates into rewarding adults for being good parents, and discounting merely having had good parents.    The culture of equal opportunity Gladwell aspires to works on these principles, but he could have gone much further in analyzing how to get there from here.   But, he is asking the right question - where does high-achievement come from, and how do we make more  of it?

B001H5X7KC|4.0|Tropic Thunder is a truly funny movie. Great acting and incredible cinematography considering it's a comedy (even if it's an \\"action-comedy\\"). But the esscence of this film is truly the huge send-up it throws to Hollywood. As the title of this review implies: The more you know and love Hollywood and all that comes with, the more you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Of course, being a war film means the modern classics of this genre are all properly lampooned: Saving Private Ryan(Great gag at the first battle scene), Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now are all represented. The fact that they went all out on the special effects and action just like in the \\"real\\" war films, really adds to the depth of the film as it can truly compete with the real films.<br /><br />If this was just a war movie send-up, it would've been enough to achieve a fun movie but the movie REALLY shines when it pokes fun at Hollywood proper. From Nick Nolte playing the \\"vet\\" that wrote the book the movie is based on, to Matthew McConaughey as the Hollywood agent to Tom Cruise in a role that runs away with this movie. There is no mercy. Awards Shows, Over-the-Top Movie Trailers(The PERFECT beggining for this film), Prima Donna Actors on set and of course the Hollywood press are covered here.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is perfect as the Stallone-like action hero looking for credibility. So is Robert Downey Jr. as the multiple Academy Award winner (his character takes more than a casual stab at Russell Crowe. Not just because he is Australian) Jack Black's character is hillarious and has one of the funniest lines in the film. Jay Baruchel plays the \\"first time in the big leagues\\" young actor(remember that Saving Private Ryan moment? Keep an eye on Baruchel) Brandon T. Jackson plays the product-pushing rapper who incidently has the best rapper name ever!<br /><br />So watch this film and enjoy! If you like comedy you will enjoy it. If you like war films you'll love it, if you like love Hollywood this is a MUST BUY.

0446402389|5.0|When I opened Child 44, I had just read a piece on the Holodomor, translated as \\"Hunger Death,\\" the Stalinist-engineered genocide that may have claimed the lives of as many as seven million Ukrainians. Tom Rob Smith brings to life this little known mass murder in the prologue in a way that no history textbook can. This dramatic start sets the stage for the further killings by the Stalinist Secret Service and the serial killer that preys on children. Smith cannot be compared to le Carré; the styles are very different, with Smith perhaps being the better writer. His prose is simple, direct; yet, the complexity of all the characters is revealed unhurriedly. Just when the reader thinks he has grasped the motives of a character, Smith throws in new information that makes one reexamine an earlier premise. The red herrings are so subtle, and the suspense maintained until the end, that even die-hard mystery aficionados will be impressed. The writer juxtaposes the themes of fraternal love - real brothers and the brotherhood of Stalin's thugs - and the innocence of children. He depicts the brutality and evil of a totalitarian government alongside the story of a married couple for whom the relationship is defined, not by love and trust, but by survival. In Leo and Raisa Demidox, Smith has created two of the most memorable characters in fiction. This is a romance story turned on its head. Their bond and journey across western Russia is as riveting as that of Fenimore Cooper's Hawkeye and Alice. The writing never falters. This is a page-turner up to the satisfying conclusion.

B00004W4UB|3.0|I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out in 1996, and have to admit that at the time, it didn't leave much of an impression. I'm a reader of classic literature, and was familiar enough with Robert Louis Stevenson's original masterpiece, though I have never read the modern adaptation by Valerie Martin, on which this movie is largely based. I'm not one of the purists who gets bent out of shape if a movie deviates all that much from a written source, provided the source is fictional, and the movie well-done in it's own right. I actually appreciated the twist of telling the classic Jeckyll-Hyde story from the viewpoint of a woman, as this was particularly absent in Stevenson's original work.<br /><br />I picked up a copy of the DVD the other day (not sure why), and after watching this little-known, atmospheric movie again the other night, have decided that it's better the second time around. Maybe that's the better way to judge most movies after all: some clearly blow you away with the first viewing, but many films like that, when viewed again after the distance of many years, lose their luster- \\"Mary Reilly\\" is the other way around for me. Watching it again after 12 years, I appreciated many aspects of the movie that just slipped by me the first time.<br /><br />For one, while much has been made of the \\"miscasting\\" of Julia Roberts, and her on-again, off-again Irish accent in this film, I think it's actually one of her better acting performances. I'm not a fan of Robert's, mainly because the bulk of her movies involve precious little serious acting: most of the time she is just asked to look pretty. \\"Mary Reilly\\" (where she is a house servant to the troubled Dr. Jeckyll- John Malkovich- in 1885 London) is the only movie of hers I have seen where her body is not primarily on display. Wearing period attire throughout the film, and with generally no makeup to embellish her face (which actually looks somewhat scarred and even haggard in many scenes), she manages to convey Mary's conflicting emotions very well.....she clearly has a fondness for Dr. Jeckyll, and conveys both fear and paradoxical attraction to the malevolent Hyde without being given all that much to say. Some real acting going on here, and while some just call this miscasting, I appreciated a side of this actress that I've not seen on display before. Her 50:50 success with the Irish accent didn't bother me as much as it apparently did for many other reviewers: at least she tried. Odd that no one gets on Malkovich (a superb actor, particularly in menacing roles like Hyde) for NEVER attempting the same. What bothered me more about Malkovich's character was not the lack of any attempt to make Hyde physically much different from Jeckyll (which many thought was hilariously thin), but the fact that Hyde's voice was NO different than Jeckyll's, other than being given more disturbing things to say. In any event, kudos to Julia Roberts for going \\"outside-the-box\\" in this role. Perhaps her role in \\"Michael Collins\\" came close to this, with a similarly subdued performance, including the accent.<br /><br />The main theme of the movie is of course well-known to fans of Stevenson's work, and my only complaint here is I wish the screenwriters had gone a little deeper with Malkovich's character, and given him a few more lines and a little more screen time by himself, to explore the timeless theme of good and evil within the heart of every man. A little less time dwelling on Julia Roberts face, and a little more with glimpses into Jeckyll's torment would have worked better.<br /><br />The costumes and sets to recreate Victorian London were well-done, though the squalor of the back streets and the forboding atmospheric fog were only given a small role in the film- and at times the interior lighting effects were at odds with the candle-light era: a bit too bright at times, when darkness, fog, and obscurity would not only have been more realistic, but more effective.<br /><br />The musical score, which totally escaped my attention the first time I saw this film, adds nicely to the tension leading up to Mary's discovery of Jeckyll's secret. It's an understated soundtrack, so you won't find yourself humming bars from it months later- but it clearly adds to the atmosphere of the film, and never detracts from a scene.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is deliberately slow, and the violence brief, never gratuitous, and largely implied. But, at 108 minutes, I never felt the movie dragged unnecessarily. Just about right.<br /><br />I give \\"Mary Reilly\\" 3 stars overall. My measure of a movie's worth is whether I would watch it more than once, and whether it holds it's entertainment value after a number of years. In this respect, \\"Mary Reilly\\" comfortably measures up. Not a classic, but worth viewing.<br /><br />I'll take it over \\"Pretty Woman\\" anyday. Well, if I'm in the mood, anyway.....caped my attention the first time I saw this film, adds nicely to the tension leading up to Mary's discovery of Jeckyll's secret.

0380018179|1.0|I went into this book knowing its a beloved classic therefore I really wanted to love it; for the first half of the book I really did. I felt connected to the characters and thought the author's ability to capture both time and place was supurb; she really made the Australian Outback come alive. I truly felt the Cleary family hardships, their bitterness and secrets. However, after awhile I found it somewhat outdated. I can't put my finger on precisely what made me feel this way, but perhaps it was the unrealistic and weak dialogue that finally did me in. Or perhaps Father Ralph's somewhat obsessive feelings towards the young Meggie made me feel uncomfortable. Regardless, despite its cult-like status, I simply can't recommend this one.
0618918248|4.0|I've recently been thinking a great deal about religion, trying to decide if there is a religion that fits into my worldview, and if there is an incarnation of God I could believe in.  I've been coming up blank.    Although the tone of this book is sometimes harsh and could be offensive to the devout, I really enjoyed reading it, as it helped me to clarify some of the major problems I have with organized religion.  I especially appreciated the author pointing out the inconsistencies in the Bible when it comes to the life of Jesus.  I also was glad that someone else had noticed how brutal some of the Bible stories are, and how they present a God who is horrifyingly unfair, unjust, and cruel.      Reading this book and finding myself agreeing with so many of the author's arguments against religion helped me to take a few more steps in the direction of atheism.  I feel enriched and better armed against religion after reading it.
B000001GY9|5.0|Leonard Bernstein was absolutely at his best conducting Schumann.  He did an outstanding job on the four Schumann Syhmphonies.  He had a talent for capturing Schumann's manic side (as in the Fourth Symphony) as well as the composer's raw talent.  This Deutsche Grammophon two-CD album is well worth the price.
0307455874|5.0|I got everything alright, but it took almost 3 weeks to get to me. I expected that I would have gotten it much sooner. Very good condition though. Would recommend using regular post instead of UPS. UPS did not buzz my apartment, and it delayed my receiving of the book even longer, and had to try to make time between school and work to go get it at the main branch. Over all, happy with the purchase, just not with the delivery issues.
0446581348|4.0|Rating: 4.5 stars      Bobbi Brown's latest book is said to be the book that her fans have been waiting years for and I can see why.  This book is incredibly comprehensive not to mention aesthetically pleasing, with its vivid, colorful and sometimes artistic photographs.     The chapters start off very basic by outlining the fundamental makeup tools and their maintenance, as well as helpful shopping tips. I liked how everything is laid out very clearly and explained in great detail. Even someone who is quite familiar with makeup and its equipment can benefit from this section. There are also sections on skin analysis which teach skincare basics and even discuss healthy lifestyle and nutrition.     The next sections feature step-by-step makeup applications for the face, lips and eyes, which take great care to educate readers about the right shades, right application and troubleshooting recommendations.     The sections start becoming more advanced which I would recommend reading after the basics are mastered or at least familiar. Bobbi Brown also includes advice for those seeking a professional career as a makeup artist which was interesting, although I imagine not incredibly relevant for the average consumer.     Above all, my favorite section of the book is on makeup for magazines, television and film because it offers a rare glimpse into the ideas behind makeup choices and really highlights the power of makeup. At the end of the book there are some more interesting sections that rarely get included into a makeup manual, such as a history of makeup and a guide to the big names in the makeup industry.     This book is a fun, beautiful and informative makeup guide, which as the title states, is \\"for everyone from beginner to pro\\".     [...]
1406711284|5.0|The plot of this novel means very little. The focus is really on the main character's arguably detached point of view, which personally, I found galling. His near-autistic lack of identification with anything--hence, I suppose, the title, makes one panicky by the book's end, as if one has just spent the day in a locked, sterile room with a dead man.<br /><br />Ironically, it's his lack of any detectable neurosis that ultimately is so disturbing....he's TOO Zen for comfort...<br /><br />It might help if he could muster sympathy for anyone, including the various victims of abuse that he encounters, or substantial feeling for the woman he is to marry, sadness at his mother's death, or empathy for the man he defensively (but pointlessly) shoots five times. The author seems to be making the point that he gets persecuted for not EXPRESSING emotion, but I as the reader was hard-pressed for proof that he FELT one.<br /><br />This lack of empathy becomes contagious to the reader; by the time he is sentenced to die, it is impossible to feel sorry for him.  It is almost, in fact, a pleasure--for it gives hope that he might yet \\"shatter the bell jar\\" and break through his wall of apathy. But no, all he feels is a vague sense of disappointment that he will no longer know the pleasures of freedom (although pleasure in this book is a relative term).  When ultimately he finds something he can identify with, it is nothing less than the \\"benign indifference of the universe\\", something he can connect with at last, as he gazes into the night sky, awaiting his execution at dawn.<br /><br />Galling but enthralling, \\"The Stranger\\" is a short and sweet read, deceptively simple, and despite itself, poignant. The protagonist's existential point of view--the axis on which \\"The Stranger\\" turns, will provide the reader with philosophical food for thought and--undoubtedly-- fodder for infinite debate.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|If you like classic rock (Zeppelin, Sabbath, etc...), you'll love Wolfmother.  Most of the songs have heavy guitar riffs that'd make Jimmy Page blush.  And the singer's voice is comparable to Ozzy. Besides the heavy riffs and singing, what most impresses me about WM is that, contrary to much music of this energy level out there today, it isn't angry music.  The singer doesn't yell or scream like he's about to blow a fuse; he sings. He doesn't sing angry. He just sings; like Plant or Ozzy. It's a shame the band broke up, but word has it that they're putting together a new band.  I sure hope so; because if they keep pumping out music like this I'll be buying from them for a long time to come because, although I love Zeppelin and the rest, it's always a pleasure to hear quality new rock in the classic style.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|Listen.  Do you like DeNiro?  Do you like Pacino?  Do you like Cop films?  Do you like the cinematography of Jon Avnet?  If you said yes to these, then you will like this movie.  Ok, it is not an academy award winner.  But it is still an excellent movie.  News Flash:  Not all movies have to be the deep, well written dialogue, etc.  \\"works of art\\" that most people seem to think they like.  I enjoyed this because I enjoy movies.  So, if you are a fan of movies, then you will enjoy this.  You want something more deep and less entertaining, then go to a museum.
B000WGNLLW|4.0|Yes, this is a very good album, not an excellent one but it's one you can listen to several times, each time it gets better. Although not my favorite album I like it.
B0017R5UAA|3.0|There were a lot of groups like this on the West Coast in the 60s.  I'm old enough to have forgotten their names.  Some were on labels, other just played the club circuit.  You'd drop some acid and listen to the jangley sounds and harmonies.  Oh, I just remembered one of them, The Incredible String Band.  You'd listen to that and then some counterculture comedy troupe on vinyl.  Then you'd make out with your girlfriend.<br /><br />I guess everything old is new again because these guys are so, so much like a Haight-Ashbury lovefest that it's startling.  They look so much like the people I knew back then that I swear I smoked dope and did acid with some of their parents or uncles.  I probably made out with some of their mothers and aunts, too.<br /><br />I don't have any of that old vinyl anymore even though it was kind of cool back then and I remember it fondly.  I don't have any need to hear this more than once, either.  It's worth a five buck download.  Maybe if you're young it sounds fresh and hip.  I'd have to take a hit of acid again to truly like this and I don't do that stuff anymore.  This one is strictly for the under 25 crowd or people very, very nostalgic about the 1960s.
0545128285|5.0|If you loved, or just liked, the Harry Potter series, I highly recommend picking up, \\"The Tales of Beetle the Bard.\\"  It was a quick and easy read, but very entertaining.  The best part for me--the commentary by Albus Dumbledore.  It was great to have him back in the story, and I agree with another reviewer that at times his commentary was even more entertaining then the actual story.  I guess for those us of that really miss the Harry Potter series, this little teaser was a great way to have those characters, illustrations, and JK Rowlings' writing about the wizarding world back for a bit.  If you haven't picked this one up yet, you need to.  It was worth it.

B000XFVIMQ|4.0|I've liked this movie since I first saw it in the theater but my fondness for the film has only grown since it's home versions.<br /><br />The story is good, the acting is fine, I actually like Nick Stahl alot better than Edward Furlong as John Connor, the graphics and action are excellent but my favorite feature is the fantastic sound design. This is one of my top ten favorite movies for sound. It's among the first I pop in to try out a new sound system. Every one of the action bits here is grade \\"A\\" demo material.<br /><br />The standard dvd was very good on it's own but the Blu Ray is just that much better. Paramount has transfered over the HD DVD master here but that's nothing to complain about as the chases, gun fights, explosions and all the lovely sounds of twisted and contorting metal are dynamically presented in high bit rate Dolby Digital Plus. You may want to tape your windows because your subwoofer will just about blow them out from all the booming your gonna get here.<br /><br />The video, while not the most impressive on Blu Ray, is still a nice improvement over the standard def release. The picture is pretty clean and free of dirt and other distracting blemishes. The details are pretty sharp and the colors can pop from time to time. It could've been better but it's still a pretty good transfer.<br /><br />I've heard far too many complaints about this movie but I find it to be fun, action packed and a fine sequel to the Terminator franchise. I don't think it right to constantly compare it with the previous two, but rather to rate it on it's own merits. Either way, T3 moved the story along nicely and set a nice premise for the upcoming T4 sequel which is in the works now. From start to finish though, this is a fun, fast-paced film and a worthy upgrade for fans and Blu Ray owners. Highly recommended.

Its great and we use it every week! Thanks  My kids love all the breads.::))
0679745203|2.0|I arrived with high expectations: this novel won the Booker no less, and I adored the movie.  Unfortunately I disliked the book for the very reasons I loved the movie: it is an epic, poetic, sweeping vision of romance.  For three hours on screen one can be carried away in this way.  But for 300 pages?  Ondaatje asks too much of us.      The characters do not speak to one another or think, unless it is in the most meticulously floral language.  There is not an inelegant passage in the book!  Of course, there are many readers open to such a book, but others should steer clear of this long winded rumination on love and war.
B001I189MQ|5.0|There certainly is no shortage of reviews for this film (during the time of this writing there are 300 on Amazon for the Single Disc DVD and over 1000 on the iTunes store), but there has been such a strong response both in favor of and against this movie that I wanted to throw in my two cents.     What makes this film, in my opinion, a masterpiece and not just another summer blockbuster is how deeply it involves the viewer in the action itself.  The masterful artistic element is how Christopher Nolan immerses the viewer.  For the first thirty minutes, the viewer does not expect much more than a well-done action flick, replete with special effects and hyperbolic action galore.  Bad guys are still being bad guys in Gotham City and Batman is still up to his old tricks (fancy gadgets and all) in his efforts to stop them.  However, Nolan gradually and carefully raises the stakes, and the movie develops from a typical action movie into an unnervingly honest appraisal of the natures of good and evil.  Unlike most superhero movies, The Dark Knight reaches further than Gotham's city limits - it demands a very personal reaction from the viewer.     At two and a half hours, the Dark Knight is a very mentally and physically taxing experience for the   viewer, as Nolan clearly intended it to be.  He carefully balances which emotions he elicits from the viewer, oscillating from uncertainty to laughter to outright terror.  This fragile balance can be (and often is) shattered at a moment's notice and then just as quickly restored through some well-timed comic relief, only heightening the overall sense of instability that dominates this film.  The viewer is constantly being denied the cathartic sense of relief so desperately needed by the film's end.  The most triumphant moments are consistently thwarted, interrupted, or otherwise overturned - so much so that the majority of the film feels dominated by desolation and hopelessness.  Since that feeling of uncertainty is so crucial toexperience the full impact of the film, I won't reveal any of the story specifics or plot devices that create these \\"overturns\\", but they are obviously felt while viewing.  Nonetheless, everything Nolan does in the Dark Knight serves to further disquiet and rattle the viewer.  From the unearthly screeching of Hans Zimmer's score, to the chillingly familiar video threats made by the Joker (evoking a sense of very real terror, imitating the style of so many terrorist videos seen during newscasts these days), to the ultimate blurring between the lines of good and evil (incredibly likeable but twisted villains - the Joker - and sometimes morally ambiguous superhero in Batman), The Dark Knight complicates the traditional understanding and expectations of a superhero movie.     Unlike other movies of the genre, Nolan's masterpiece presents a very complex understanding of morality and forces the viewer to analyze his own morality in the tense \\"What would I do?\\" moments throughout the film.  And while everything else about the movie is entirely epic and grandiose, morality is very realistically complicated and personal.  Nolan is able to successfully individualize the epic and takes the viewer through a wide range of emotional experiences.  The culmination of all the uncertainty, moral ambiguity, and terror built upon during the film make the ending of this movie, without spoiling it, one of the most rewarding experiences in modern cinema.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This is clearly Madonna's Pinnacle, those who deny it are kidding themselves.     Every song bar act of contrition on here is a winner. It shows Madonna has something to say and showcases that talent. Stephen Bray and Pat Leonard do help the cause here but ultimately it's madonnas lyrics and voice that hit home these amazing songs.    Yes i love this album, but do not own any other Madonna works.      Highlights include the beautiful Promise to Try, the cheery Dear jesse and the stormy Till death do us part.      It stands up very well 19 years after release, do yourself a favour non Madonna fans and pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|McCartney must age like fine wine because  he's getting more creative and more Beatlesque  as the years go on.. the first half of this  record is as good as anything he's ever put  out and that's saying a lot I think!
B00005RHGK|5.0|I know, a monster movie starring Justin \\"I'm a Mac\\" Long, right? But this is not your average modern piece o'crap monster flick, this is a good old fashioned creeper with another of those \\"we're totally screwed because we've wandered into local folkore\\" premises, and a monster that's all sorts of weird and unsettling. I love this movie. Love. Right to the end when it plays some old big band song about the Boogie Man. By the way, I haven't seen it, but the sequel apparently sucks.

0307346617|4.0|This is a great book. You should buy it and read it. But the book has some built-in flaws, such as:<br /><br />This is a story without a hero, without character arcs, without relationships and a whole lot of other basic things that most stories have.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is so well thought out, well written, engaging and original that it works. Problem is, the end of the book has no climax. No hero's journey equals no climax. A truly great story has a hero and climax.<br /><br />Of course, Max Brooks knows this. And breaking the rules is okay if you know the rules, which he does.<br /><br />James Roy Daley<br />Author of The Dead Parade<br />[[ASIN:1934861103 The Dead Parade]]
0307386171|2.0|Ian McEwan set himself the writerly task of composing a novel whose entire action takes place in just a few hours and succeeded. However, along the way he failed to help the reader much care about the young couple whose lives turn on a dime on their honeymoon night. The characters are so two-dimensional that their cataclysm fails the believability test. No one THAT much in love could behave THAT stupidly.<br /><br />McEwan is handy with a phrase, however vacuous the result. If you are fond of TV drama, this may just be your ticket, but life is short and there are more good books to read than you will ever have time to open.
0143038583|5.0|This book changed my life. No really, it did. It is beautifully well written but contains so much valuable and accessible information. Everyone should be required to read it because it dispels many misperceptions about food products available today. Michael Pollan is one of the greatest authors I've ever read and I recommend this book to everyone. In fact, I plan to give it to everyone for Christmas this year.
0060558121|4.0|I wasn't quite sure about this book when I first started reading it, but as I understood more of the story I ended up really loving this book! It takes you places you've never been before, and I love thinking about the concept of gods in an American way, with our values and culture superimposed on an ancient belief system. Makes you think very closely about your way of life. I do recommend it.

B001J1A20M|5.0|Daniel Harding and the Vienna Philharmonic do this symphony the most justice yet. I have listened to every recording of this work and this is by far the best and most authentic being that it is the orchestra that Mahler held under his baton the longest. From the monophonic viola tutti at the beginning to the last swell of the violins in the final Adagio, this is a well constructed, well played, and wonderfully interpreted version of a symphony shrouded in controversy and mystery. The Vienna players do such justice to this that it is heart wrenching to listen to knowing what Mahler was going through to compose it. Both Adagios are well paced and soulful. The two scherzos are at the right speed and the subtle Viennese lilts are only placed well by those who do them without thinking about it. The middle movement is so well developed that when the fear chord arrives one is not ready as one should be. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! I look forward to more from Daniel Harding and the VPO.    Peter M.

0142406562|4.0|Sometimes we feel like the weight of the world is on our shoulders. For Alex Rider the pressure might be too much to handle. Stormbreaker written by Anthony Horowitz is a non-stop, thriller book, which leaves you breathless after every chapter.      In the book Stormbeaker Alex is a teenage who lives in London with his uncle and his house keeper. One day the police came to his door to announce the brutal death of his uncle in a cover up car accident. Later, Alex finds out about a secret mission that his uncle was in and meet up face to face with a dangerous contract killer that killed his uncle. Now he wants to all the school students around the world with a computer called \\"The Stormbreaker\\" that releases a deadly virus of small pox. Find out what Alex will do next to stop this man in his tracks.      In addition to the book Stormbreaker there is also a movie. The movie is not as good as the book because some of the important parts of the book are switched for differ parts. There is more talking in the movie. Over all, both of the versions of the story are full of action and wonderful.      Some of the strengths of Stormbreaker are that the author did a good job describing events in the book because there was a lot to remember to get clues. An example of this is the part when Alex went to the library to look for spy books and saw a number on a book that he saw somewhere else. Some weaknesses are that the author did not spend a lot of time explaining the events or the characters. An example of that is when Alex first met Mr. Grin. The author never told the readers who he was and why he is so important to the mission.      Stormbreaker is for 5th and 8th grade students that like action packed adventures. The text is good sized and the words are okay to read with. The genre of the book is action-adventure fiction. This book is different from other books within the same genre because this book is interesting and full of action that will open your jaw.All in all, the author did a good job keeping his topic and writing it descriptively. I think stormbraker is an excellent book for all teens who are looking for a action packed book.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Yes people. I am this years Santa and if you don't think I see everything, guess again! Oh yes. I see you decorating trees, rushing and scurrying at the mall, knocking other people down to get to that last sale item. Then your anger reaches a fever pitch when you can't remember and can't find where you parked the car. Oh yes. From my green and red condo at the North Pole (which Santa generously let me use until Christmas Eve), I see all. Don't think for one minute naughty or nice doesn't apply right now. Elves are terrible gossips and will advise me up til the last minute.<br /><br />I settled down with some brandy and this \\"Christmas Vacation\\" DVD. Now, I know there are many Christmas movies out there that are attuned to some type of emotion. Some will make you feel joy and some will amuse and delight you. However, none of them stand up to the hysterical escapade that this movie represents. This is one of Chevy Chase's finest moments in comedy, playing the Christmas foil wrapping to our delight. I never fail to watch this at this time of year. It is essential. Revealing the essence of Christmas with all the absurd elements that truly do make it the unique holiday that it is.<br /><br />Chevy plays Clark Griswold, looking forward to his bonus check and a family reunion, inviting all the relatives to his home. The movie starts out with his car getting trapped underneath a truck and, from there, you know you are in for more disaster.<br /><br />The rapid-fire changing situations hit more often than miss your funny bone. Sometimes, you border on being hysterical with laughter. Yes, it is that funny. So many scenes that are good no matter how much you watch it.<br /><br />Some of my favorites? Chevy at a department store speaking to a hot woman at the lingerie counter. The naughty word play is just too funny, time and time again. (This young lady appears later in a scene whereby Chevy looks out at the imaginary in ground pool he plans to build, sees her, and his eye-bulging look as she whips her bikini at the window). As clever as your Metamorpho is, I don't know if I could come up with this on my best day.<br /><br />Do not forget his aunt's cat chewing on wires, the exploding turkey (with puffs of steam) and the squirrel who wrecks havoc and is the last straw for his tortured yuppie neighbors. There is just so much fun to this movie, and total disaster has never been more uproarious.<br /><br />I cannot tell you of each funny scene, but you must see it because this movie is definitely unique within this genre. So, put it on as you wrap your gifts. Just remember, the cat and jello are off limits!<br /><br />Drive my gift to my front door....<br /><br />Ornamentally yours -- Metamorpho ;)i at the window).

0374531269|5.0|Here it is a book about adventure and action, emotion and death. The memoirs of a boy soldier. The war in South Africa took its toll on thousands of people, emotionally and physically. Poverty plagues Ishmael Beah in Along Way Gone.    Along Way Gone should be read by adults only. The book uses graphic description and profanity not suitable for minors or teens. The events in this book have happened and have happened to many children. This is nothing line any book I have ever read. Exciting and fun but at different parts of the book he mixes in sadness.    As the main character, Ishmael, tries to walk away from his worst nightmare, he runs into problems. After the atrocities that happened to him and his family he finds refuge with his family. Try picturing thatched roofs blazing with fire, women and children screaming for there lives and the only thing you are worried about is you might not have drugs for the night.    Along way gone cannot relate to any of my real life situations or even any books I have read but can relate to similar situations. Genocide and poverty has corrupted South Africa's coast line. Both, the civil war and Ishmael's life as a soldier are the same in many ways.    Ishmael Beah changes a good hearted kid into a ruthless troublesome teenager as he is faced with many different challenges such as starvation and death. He also uses very descriptive paragraphs to enlighten the reader. These horrific tragedies are repeated and repeated throughout the story line.    After I have read this book many times, I think the book has a very good description of the civil war in South Africa. This book sums up the atrocities that occurred there. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to read it.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Yes, yes people. Since I have some time while the elves are wrapping all the gifts and feeding the reindeer, I decided to write this worthy review for you. You say you didn't know I was filling in for Santa this year? Well. I had to. This is what happens when Santa donates big bucks to your ill-fated election campaign. Or is it doe? Ah well, you get the gist.<br /><br />Because the season is right, I decided for an excellent holiday movie for your consideration: The Polar Express. I saw this seasons ago when it first came out and I was so impressed with it that I had to have it on DVD. I suggest you all get a copy quickly before Father Time arrives on New Year's Eve. He can be very cruel to those who don't listen to the wisdom of Metamorpho. Heck, he's cruel to everyone. Last time I looked, no one was getting any younger.<br /><br />Anyway, let's climb aboard The Polar Express awhile and discuss the movie. It centers around a young boy who's losing the magic of his childhood dreams. Everywhere he looks, there are signs that point to the non-existence of Santa Claus. How preposterous. That's like saying Seers don't exist, which, of course they do, if you'll just ignore those catcalls you hear.<br /><br />So, on Christmas Eve, the boy hears this train rumble and stop in front of his house. Do keep in mind he tears his robe pocket in his excitement to see the train up close. That action is a major factor throughout the movie and is the main motivator towards a lot of what happens.  Reluctantly, the boy climbs aboard and is soon treated to a variey of children. One kid is so nerdy and annoying that I'm sure part of the audience prays for him to be thrown from the train. But the other characters he meets are fine; the tender-hearted girl and the lonely and sad boy.<br /><br />As we learn, the train is heading towards the North Pole with Tom Hanks as the constantly checking stopwatch Conductor. The journey is amazing. Zemeckis uses CG Technology (a digital process) to convey an outerworldly and mystikal feel to the movie. The whole train ride is a cause and effect freefall of many ideas. Whether it be surreal acrobatic waiters serving hot chocolate, the excursion of the girl's lost train ticket (a journey that makes Forrest Gump's feather pale in comparison), or the roller coaster train ride as it double times across breaking ice, you will certainly be treated to eye-popping special effects throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />The theme of the movie is belief, without which, Santa nor Christmas could truly exist. But, more than that, it is a retraining for people who have lost the magic of Christmas. In a way, the movie beckons us to learn to grow young. As Tom Hanks says to the child, \\"Seeing is believing. But, most real things we can't see\\".<br /><br />They reach the North Pole and more mayhem ensues as our major children get lost and wind up in Santa's toysack. The awe and magic of the North Pole town is yet another wonder. Add into that, the townsquare scene with more elves than there were people at Woodstock cheering as Santa makes an appearance. All these scenes create light hearted pomp and joy to this movie.<br /><br />I will not reveal all the surprises here. But, do see it. It will be a marvel to you forever. In the end, when the boy exits the train, the Conductor tells him, \\"the true spirit of Christmas lies in your heart\\". And Zemeckis drives this point home with an enchanting movie such as this.<br />True, when this movie first came out he was criticized for the digitalization of the characters. The critics brayed that it was not a success. Let me tell you, the critics lied. Everytime I have seen the movie I think my imagination has taken over and I see more into it. It is a magikal cinematic method for a magikal movie. Very appropriate. And, ironically, the movie's motif was belief, which those critics obviously missed.<br /><br />I consider this movie a heart-warming Christmas classic which all people can enjoy. Itis about the spirit within all of us. It is universal. I urge all of you to get a copy quick, or else, you might find coal in your stocking this year. And to answer your question, yes, I might reconsider. But many accolades and serious fawning are required.<br /><br />Anyway, a fine, fine movie to add to your collection.<br /><br />Happy Hollidaze------ Metamorphoof you to get a copy quick, or else, you might find coal in your stocking this year.

0786838655|4.0|The setting of the book takes place during the time of Greek Gods, demigods, satyrs and other mythological creatures.  The book is about two boys named Percy and Grover.  Grover always has a sight on everything, like death.  At school one day, Grover had a sight of his teacher killing him with a magical pen.  The two boys go on a class field trip with a teacher named Mr. Brunner, who uses a wheel chair. They like their teacher a lot, but Percy decides to vaporize Mr. Brunner while on this field trip.  It's at this point when Percy begins to suspect that his life is not what it seems.     I thought the plot outline of the The Lightning Thief was very suspenseful and tense.  For Percy Jackson, his life was very tough for him as a kid.  He was kicked out of all the schools he attended.  He was very troubled.  Percy Jackson is a demigod.  His dad was named Poseidon, goddess of controlling water.  His mother was not a God, she was undetermined.  His parents have vanished, in the hands of Hades, goddess of keeping.  Percy is on a mission to save his mom from Hades but it takes him a long time because something is in his way.     Another book that The Lightning Thief can connect to is a book called Maximum Ride.  There's a connection to the book because Maximum Ride and The Lightning Thief are both about Mythology and Greek Gods and other mythological creatures.  The biggest strengths in The Lightning Thief are how the characters are on missions to save certain things. They have special powers that they can use.  Another strength is how the book uses Greek gods such as demigods, satyrs and martyrs.  A weakness is how the author kind of goes off in another world, like he doesn't always talk about the gods. One last strength is how the book shows the turning point of when Percy overcomes his learning difficulties.     All in all, I think the book was pretty good, and well written.  I recommend this book to people who enjoy mythology.  This is the type of audience who would read the book.  The book also shows how someone with difficulties, such as Percy, turns these difficulties into strengths.  The author keeps the same audience throughout the whole book.  The genre of the book is mythology because it talks about Greek Gods.
0307269752|3.0|It is a shame that Stieg Larsson died in 2004 before he was able to see his book rise to success in the US.  This, his English-language debut, is a solid novel that unfortunately loses its bite in the last third.<br /><br />The first 2/3 of this novel are outstanding - fast moving, intimate characterizations and a look inside Swedish politics/magazine wars/corruption/wealth.  Larsson combines this with a decades-old missing persons mystery that keeps you guessing, for a while.<br /><br />Regretably, the denoument of the major mystery of this book is solved too soon and the ultimate revenge plot that fills up the rest of the novel is just not very interesting.  This book would have benefited from tighter editing and cutting about 100 pages from the text.  I do hope his next English-language release (he signed a deal for 3 books before he died) has more bite because Larsson is definitely a solid writer.

B001EYGOEM|3.0|Swift's second album continues the appealing pop of her debut. Her teenage voice is still a bit reedy, but the brassy edge provides balance to the perfectly arranged and polished productions. It's hard to understand why Swift is lauded with country music airplay and awards, since her music and subject matter only occasionally feint to country music's roots (is that a mandolin playing on \\"Breathe\\" and an atmospheric hint of pedal steel on \\"Tell me Why\\"?). This isn't a criticism of a Nashville artists pushing into pop territory, it's a wonder how and why a talented pop artist such as Swift positions her music in country music channels. One can only assume Swift was weaned on the later works of Faith Hill.<br /><br />Swift solves one of the main problem facing teenage artists by writing her own material. Eighteen's an awkward age for a songwriter, though: too old to sing cute songs of youth, but not yet old enough to really sing with the experience of age. She walks the tightrope with songs of longing, broken hearts, love, and preternatural experience that can speak to both aspirational teenage fans and older listeners, and she's convincing. Her nostalgic \\"The Best Day\\" is a standout with its gentle arrangement and warm memories of caring parents. Some may by tempted to lump Swift with the interchangeable starlets churned out by Disney, but despite the adolescent focus of her lyrics, she's emotionally deeper than Miley Cyrus or Selena Gomez, a better singer and writer than Britney, and she has grander artistic ambitions than all three put together. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|There are plenty of reviews for the movie but as far as price... here is a consideration. I was going to buy the 3 disc Blu-ray set from Amazon but when someone gave me a $25 gift certificate to Target (a store I never shop at) I decided to buy it there. But the price at Target was utterly outrageous $37.99 BEFORE tax. after tax it was over $40.00<br /><br />Amazon's prices are fantastic.
B000PC0S5K|3.0|Eckhart Tolle is a good psychologist in some ways and he seems to understand the human condition. At times this book seems written by a very old soul who has been observing humanity since the beginning. The ideas in A New Earth seem to come from a combination of Buddhism, Hinduism and New Age thoughts. There is a sprinkling of Jesus' ideas for consideration although they are interpreted in a more Buddhist way some of the time.<br /><br />Now to begin with Eckhart Tolle seems to believe in evolution so some Christians are going to disagree with the book right from the start. Also he says God is &#34;Source&#34; which I think is very New Age. The truth is what this book actually seems to be teaching is that humans are actually God. I say this because he says the reader is actually &#34;common divinity&#34; or &#34;the timeless I AM.&#34; If you've read the Bible you realize he is trying to say that &#34;I AM' is you. I can't accept that I am God. If I was I'd have way more power to do immense good in the world. Eckhart also seems to believe that sin only means &#34;to live blindly&#34; instead of disobeying God's laws. So the thought that &#34;you are God&#34; is prominent throughout the book. It is explained as &#34;consciousness.&#34;<br /><br />This book also teaches that enlightenment is like salvation by Jesus or an awakening. I think there is a difference between Buddhist awakening and enlightenment and Jesus' method of salvation. On the one hand you have a process of working for your own salvation - Buddhism and Jesus providing your salvation by your belief in Jesus - Christianity. The two ways to &#34;salvation&#34; or &#34;enlightenment&#34; seem a little different.<br /><br />While the psychology elements of this book are quite interesting and fascinating there are sometimes little comments which Eckhart Tolle doesn't expand on fully. Like he'll say that heaven is not a location. This can't be true as the Bible teaches it is a location and people who've had near-death experiences come back and say they've been there. So there is a lot more evidence for heaven than against it.<br /><br />What I do think Eckhart Tolle is good at is explaining what the ego is and how it works. You will definitely relate to that. Although I've somewhat come to the conclusion that the ego can actually evolve from self centeredness to selflessness. You can go from being a very proud person to being very humble. This type of spiritual evolution I can believe in. I don't think you need to eradicate the ego or become a person who doesn't think and has a blank mind. To make moral decisions you need to think.<br /><br />This book has some interesting segments like the part on parenting and the section discussing addiction. And with that said I think if you think you are enlightened just stay or get married and raise some children. That would be a good test to see if you are enlightened or not.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewnear-death experiences come back and say they've been there.

B001GKYBXA|4.0|Who or what could possibly top Paul McCartney? Why only Paul McCartney! This time, it is not as a Wing or a Beatle or as Percy Thrills Thrillington, but as The Fireman, with Electric Arguments as the third release under this alias and, for the same reason, the third collaboration with the producer, Youth.    Electric Arguments is a sonic parallel with George Harrison's Cloud Nine pairing with Jeff Lynne but more techno. Starting out is the loud and proud Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight, which is reminiscent of You Never Give Me Your Money or So Glad to See You Here. Following up is Two Magpies, which interestingly enough, sounds like a hybrid of Blackbird and Honey Pie.    The third track is the awe-inspiring Sing the Changes, which, to me, is rightfully the highlighted tune of this release. It is a very in-depth, emotional song very much on par with No More Lonely Nights. The rest of the tracks are also great. Among my favorites are the Beatle-esque Highway, the feel-good Sun Is Shining, Lifelong Passion, and the Enigma-like Lovers in a Dream.    Truly, McCartney is unequalled. As The Fireman he, combined with the production talent of Youth, has created a 21st century equivalent of the tape loop, experimental sounds sampled in Revolver and The Beatles (a.k.a. The White Album) some 40+ years prior.    Vocally, McCartney sounds the best he has in quite some time. The singing is very much in sync with the spontaneous, creative energy that emanates throughout. If McCartney can segue this style into his releases as Paul McCartney, I definitely anticipate more great work from this artist, who is well past sixty. Wow!

B001BPJJ82|5.0|It's so refreshing when every once in a while, a true gem of a movie is produced.  I went to the theater to see this movie THREE times, and I NEVER do that!  I had to go multiple times to show my friends and family this tale of tales.  The colors and scenery are so amazing.  It's funny, charming, mystical, magical, dark, sad, creative, and most of all, SPECTACULAR.  Highly recommended.  I wish there were more movies like this!
0446579939|1.0|\\"The Lucky One\\" is trite, predictable and so full of clichés that it is an embarrassing book.  You can scan every third or fourth page and get the entire story.  Why do people continue to read this guy?  I checked this book out of the library not realizing who the author was. In my defense I was in a hurry and it was cold and stormy outside. I had previously (and unhappily) read \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"Message in a Bottle\\"...Good grief what makes him so popular?  They even make movies out of this stuff.  After reading this book I know for sure who the lucky one is.   It is mind boggling! I am trying to think of a redeeming quality here but...
B0001XWV12|5.0|If you are looking for a funny movie with great visual comedy, sexual comedy and a catchy song - this is it!      Great movie to watch with friends who are twins - especially if they are a boy and girl set.    Own this movie, have watched it several times and each time I watch, I find new stuff to laugh at.  Just bought it for a friend for a Christmas gift - he likes Wedding Crashers types of movies.  Plus his wife calls him \\"Scotty\\" so it's perfect!    Perfect gift for any man in your life named Scott.    This movie has what appears to be real footage throughout Europe.  Buy this movie!  I own the basic full screen version, but I bought my friend above the unrated widescreen version to fit his TV better.  Pick it up!!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|McCartney has always sounded better live than on studio recordings. I've been fortunate to see McCartney once (yes, only once) live. And as expected he was a master craftsman at every instrument he touched, be it voice, piano, guitar, bass. Amazing. Beyond being a &#34;Jack of all instruments&#34;, he seems to have a gift for off handed improvisational bits. I mean, like a yell here, and a little guitar thing there. The little things that make it all come together. It's just right. The Fireman project, with each song given one day to record, then neatly tucked away, allows McCartney to improvise and yet come up with a studio recording. And one well worth listening to.<br /><br />Paired with a bloke called Youth (aka Martin Glover formerly of Killing Joke and a well accomplished Producer), he has managed to go beyond the often wet and perfumy sugared down pop and managed to give us a decent embodiment of modern new age, blues, experimental rock. It's a pleasure to hear, never searing the ears with gooey &#34;love gone bad&#34; lyrics. John would have been proud, for it sounds more like a john-esque project then one you would expect to hear from McCartney. Not to say that I was not an immense fan of Paul's melodic, hard driving pop songs. For I was. Just that he hasn't seemed to be able to pull those out in several years (decades?). Just as early critics of the Beatles marked Paul as a great R & B singer, this recording shows that &#34;the Blues&#34; is his forte. Often experimental, with eery droning some, but also with good driving beats, some Blues, and everything is solid. In at least one song, Paul is playing Bass, 2 different guitars, keyboards, congas (?), drums, pan pipes, and of course vocals. And the vocals... let's talk vocals...Almost every song uses a different technique with the vocals along with different tone ranges. On his solo albums for the past several years, Paul seems to be searching for a sound, not really knowing what or how or who to help himfind it. It's a wonder he hasn't used Youth for his &#34;Paul McCartney&#34; solo albums. Sometimes it's just the right person and just the right combination. And this is it. No, this is not a happy super pop album, it is eery night music, sometimes dark. But it is music at it's best. The way McCartney needs to be, more relaxed and natural. Superb.<br /><br />Listening to these songs I hear influences from other bands; U2, Peter Gabriel, CCR, Beck, Ozark Mtn. Daredevils, the Mars Volta, , Enigma, Jon Anderson. And yet, all of these artists were influenced by the Beatles. So, in essensce he is only influencing himself!<br /><br />The album starts off with the Bluesy &#34;Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight&#34;, sounding very much like the Stones, or the Beatles &#34;Why Don't We Do It In the Road&#34; from the &#34;White Album&#34;.<br /><br />On &#34;Two Magpies&#34; they keep it simple in a &#34;Blackbird&#34; sort of way.<br /><br />&#34;Sing the Changes&#34; is immediately my favorite and could easily be a top 40 song (if the verses were cut a bit). Compelling sermon like delivery with a nice guitar riff bringing everything together.<br /><br />In &#34;Traveling Light&#34; McCartney puts on his Peter Gabriel impression, playing flute and singing with a low Peteresque vocal.<br /><br />&#34;Highway&#34; is a pretty straight forward pop rock song with a driving beat. This is my least favorite of all the songs on this cd.<br /><br />&#34;Light From Your Lighthouse&#34; reminds one of a hillbilly drinking song. This one sounds like a mixture of the Ozark Mtn. Daredevils, CCR, and Beck.<br /><br />&#34;Sun Is Shining&#34; just has that orb like feeling you get with some U2 songs. Very U2-ish.<br /><br />&#34;Dance 'Til We're High&#34; is another one of my favorites. For some reason, this one reminds me of early / mid 80's college/Indi radio. It also has tinges of Genesis...<br /><br />&#34;Lifelong Passion&#34; is another one that gives off that U2/Peter Gabriel/Genesis aura. One of my top four.<br /><br />&#34;Is This Love&#34; with pan pipes (?), another one of my top four, could easily be the background music for the Titanic. On a later note: Reminds me of whales, water, and could easily be a tribute to these majestic creatures.<br /><br />&#34;Lover in a Dream&#34; - When I first heard the Mars Volta, I thought they drew their sound from the Beatles... well, I think he drew this sound from Mars Volta. :)<br /><br />&#34;Universal Here, Everlasting Now&#34; is a great example of a more modern - yet seemingly natural - approach to the music. Here we have an independent guitar... and a totally independent drum beat... put together to make this amazingly compatible musical piece.<br /><br />And, finally, the coda &#34;Don't Stop Running&#34;. I have been a Beatles fan for over 40 years. I have listened to McCartney for....ages... and yet, I have never heard him sing like this. He sounds like Jon Anderson (of Yes). And... it works! And with an interesting harpsichord like sound... just everything on this album is a hodge podge of sounds and instruments... and it is never boring. Well, except for the 3 minute interval towards the end of this song. Much like &#34;The End&#34; as it goes into &#34;Her Majesty&#34; on the &#34;Abbey Road&#34; album.<br /><br />All in all, I love this album. This is the best thing McCartney has done since the mid 70's. But don't expect it to sound like the mid 70's. It sounds like 2008. It's great!<br /><br />To quote McCartney &#34;The Fireman takes your hand and leads you through the blaze to places you didn't know you wanted to go.&#34;<br /><br />Julie

It took her a little bit to figure out what the stick was for, but once she did, we couldn't stop the drumming.  It's adorable, and not too loud.
B001FBSMW6|1.0|I'm a HUGE Keane fan and have been for a few years.  I absolutely loved their album Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea - which I thought were both masterpieces - although it is tough to top those 2 albums - this one all I can say is OH MY GOD.  The entire album sounds like a bad 80's semi-disco group.   Even Tom's voice sounds different. Topping Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea would be tough - but it's like they didn't even try to dig deep inside themselves.......I will not listen to this DVD - I am hugely dissapointed in their new style and really hope they go back to their \\"old style\\" that Keane is truly known and loved for with their next Album.  Sorry guys - but I am not happy with it at all.

0312427999|4.0|Well written and very informative, but can be quite depressing when you learn what the wealthy do to stay wealthy and why the world is losing its middle class.

1844132390|5.0|Professor Gordon W. Allport writes in the preface to Dr. Victor Frankl's book, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" that, \\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity is a psychiatrist worth listening to\\". I could not agree more.    With a gentle yet critical eye, Dr. Frankl documents in great detail the physical, emotional and psychological conditions endured by the prisoners of Nazi concentration camps during the insanity of the second World War, based on first-hand experience. Although of Jewish background, Dr. Frankl presents a perspective more secular than religious, with values that all humanity can identify with and learn from, yet he never disregards the possibilities inherent in something \\"higher\\" than human understanding.     The book is divided into two parts. The first - \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" - is Frankl's autobiographical narrative, while the second part - \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" - contains a brief summary of the system of psychotherapy that Frankl developed throughout his life. The style of writing does not appreciably change between the sections, and the language is relatively simple and pleasant to read, which I always take as a sign of a talented author.     The experiences that Frankl describes make for fascinating and shocking reading. The level of deprivation and brutality the prisoners were subjected to does not seem comprehensible at times, and yet Frankl's humble and matter-of-fact style insists upon the reader's serious attention. As well as the anecdotes of concentration camp life, Frankl outlines various psychological states and phases experienced by prisoners - both those who did and did not survive. Interestingly, he also classifies people into two distinct types based on the conditions - the \\"race\\" of the \\"decent man\\" and the \\"indecent man\\", and these \\"races\\" were seen in all groups - Jew, Nazi, guard or prisoner. Frankl's observations along these lines seem especially interesting when viewed in the context of Ponerology.    Although Frankl's work carries a warning of the suffering and misery that human beings can allow to be perpetrated on a mass scale, his writing always turns to the optimistic, hopeful and meaningful, and what can be learned through suffering. Indeed, his system of psychotherapy - logotherapy - is based on hope and finding meaning. The second part of the book contains more information on this.    I strongly recommend this book to anyone with the even the slightest interest in psychology or history. Well written, insightful and touching, its success to date shows clearly that Dr Frankl has overcome immense suffering and touched something of the human soul in his life and work. He stands as an inspiration to all who aspire to express the creative aspects of Existence.
B001HXG8PK|2.0|This is a 2 disc set and Disc 1 is EXACTLY the same as the \\"regular\\" Dark Knight score which as of this writing costs $14 new.  So for a cost of $42 you get one disc you probably already own and a second disc with 14 tracks thrown together.  And four of those 14 are remixes. Yawn.  Why don't they simply put all the music from the movie in the same order it plays in the movie and put that on two discs?  That would be of value.  But paying so much for so little doesn't make sense.  Unless you are a superfan, buy the regular soundtrack (which is still not in chronological order. UGH!)
B001GV09FS|2.0|The 19 track list that is currently on this listing is a total fantasy (the CD has 17 tracks and they are not in the order listed, I expect Amazon will eventually correct the listing, wish they had done so before I wasted money on something I already had). No difference from original CD, I too bought this for the missing tracks only to find out they are still missing (and I'm going to have to rip them off the DVD). Bogus.

B0000029DD|3.0|I'd never really heard of Jeff Buckley and wasn't particularly interested in alternative music in the '90's. I heard one song from his posthumous release, and absolutely loved it. So I had to know more about him. Tragic thing that such promising talent was cut short. I saw the video for \\"So Real\\" and was enraptured. Maybe it had something to do with its siren-like, haunting chorus; couldn't get that damned song/his vocals outta my head for days. He sings the hell out of this track...to me anyway. That's why I bought this album. Having researched further, \\"So Real\\" was a song that wasn't supposed to make the cut and one Jeff Buckley really liked. I can't explain it, but somehow I feel him more in this song; maybe this was the sound/style he wanted to achieve (?). While there are great songs on this album like 'Mojo Pin' --an childhood crush/ode to his rock heroes Led Zeppelin--popchart/Top 40 friendly \\"Last Goodbye\\", and \\"Grace\\", I can't really say that I was exactly raving like others about it. I love Buckley's soulful voice, its range, and genre-crossing quality, but the love songs can be a bit gooey, and maudlin (\\"Lover You Should've Come Over\\",\\"Lilac Wine\\" cover). I really don't understand people's fascination with \\"Hallelujah\\"...does absolutely nothing for me, it just drones. \\"Dream Brother\\" is very hypnotic, dark, and trippy; there's no denying the power of that song and is a favorite of mine. For me this album sounds to be an \\"experiment\\" in sounds and genres. I got a sense of a young artist who's just released an album and not quite sure in which musical direction he wants to go. I believe that was the case for Jeff Buckley; he was afraid this album made him come off as \\"soft\\". And, to be honest, it does. You get a sense of the undiscovered/\\"days of Siné\\" Buckley, and the side that wants to \\"rock out\\". There's no doubt that this man would've/could've done so much exploration with his music and been successful, though not hugely popular--as I don't think it would appeal to those with simple taste. No doubt he [has] garnered a cult-like following and many intrigued, respectful, adoring admirers like myself in life and death. I would've bought any and every album this man released!    Strangely enough, I can't seem to take this cd out of my car...
1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is a realistic book that takes the reader through the difficult journey of Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD).<br /><br />Meet Alice Howland a 50 year old distinguished Harvard Cognitive Psychology Professor who is at the top of her game.  She is living a comfortable New England lifestyle with her husband and children when she begins to discover lapses in her short-term memory and periods of disorientation.  Attributing it to other things like menopause, she ignores them until she no longer can.  After meeting with doctors and undergoing a battery of tests, she is discovered to have EOAD.  As the reader, you will get to experience Alice's journey as she walks through diagnosis and shares this with her husband and family.  There is also a genetic link to the disease and a 50/50 chance that her children are carrying the gene mutation and will develop EOAD at some point.  The book touches on this as well.<br /><br />The book lets you walk intimately in the shoes of Alice Howland and how she becomes disconnected from her former self.  The reader experiences the angst and frustration that Alice feels as she begins to wander deeper into the abyss of the disease that is stealing her former self through the loss of short-term memory and recognition.<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read--but I believe it is an important one.  I think this is a book that can help those newly diagnosed with EOAD and more importantly their caretakers and family and friends.  The book will also help others (I have MS with mild dementia) to gain a better awareness of how much Alzheimer's effects and entrenches all areas of life.<br /><br />Mental illness is still very much stigmatized in our society and the reader will feel Alice's hurt and disconnect with herself and society.  No fluff.  Some other reviewers mentioned the book was \\"too academic\\"--I would disagree.  For the readers of this book who have probably done research on the web and have a general understanding of the disease, things may feel familiar.  For a casual reader picking this book up for a \\"beach read\\"--no fun here--pick something else.<br /><br />This book is the real deal and I'm grateful that I had the chance to read it, feel it. and have the chance to share my view on it.  If you or someone you know is effected by Alzheimer's Disease or dementia this is a must read.eel familiar.

B001C08RHA|3.0|Somewhere between the genius of Batman & Spiderman essence and the extreme ComicBookesqueness of Starship Troopers.  Simplistic, similar messages for all, but separated works by the means and methods of the execution.  Downey is a bit clownish and never really a convincing character in his minimal dialogue, slapstickish role - starts and ends as a 2-D fellow.  Not sure what Palthrow's issue and direction were but who cares,  Jeff Bridges came off solid and believable as the egomaniac come of age.  Storyline and plot are chop shopish at best and connected only by the action.  Overall, entertaining 2hours worthy of three stars and a rental.  In rank with the hulk and fantastic four but not quite the 'man' enough to keep pace and face with the spider, bat, and super.

1416550518|3.0|In the early 20th century, a girl named Grace began working a servant at an English manor called Riverton.  Now an old lady with a mind full of secrets and regrets, Grace is ready to share the ghosts of her past with one person -- her grandson -- through a series of recorded audiotapes.  Meanwhile, a filmmaker has come to interview Grace; she is making a film about Riverton -- specifically about one notorious, terrible event that happened at Riverton in 1924.  But will Grace reveal Riverton's secrets to this filmmaker?  And will she even reveal all her secrets to her grandson?<br /><br />In my mind, traditionally, a good mystery novel begins with some kind of event; a murder or a theft, and then spends the rest of its pages trying to solve the crime.  \\"The House At Riverton\\" defies this convention.  It gives hint after hint of some big event to come, yet time and time again it pulls the reader away just when it seems we're getting close.  Though the first half of the novel does help to set up later events (as in, \\"yes, this story is going somewhere, I promise!\\"), I found it difficult to get through.  By the last fourth of the novel, I had become relatively engaged, but it took so long to get there, I had to set the book aside multiple times.  Yes, it eventually becomes a page-turner, with an event worthy of any suspense novel, but will the average reader be able to get to that point without giving up in despair?<br /><br />While reading this novel, I was reminded of two things: First, the film \\"Titanic,\\" because, like that movie, \\"The House At Riverton\\" is about an old woman recounting the events of her youth, centering around a famous event, slowly revealing the untold secrets of her -- and its -- past.  Second, I was constantly reminded of the TV series \\"Manor House\\" (aka \\"The Edwardian Country House,\\" as it was called in the UK), even going so far as to picture Riverton to look just like the house did on that series, right down to the grounds and the servant's quarters.  Therefore, I was not surprised that the author had actually been inspired by this very series, according to the acknowledgements at the end of the book.  So that's neat.<br /><br />I love reading about the Edwardian era, and overall I thought this was a good story.  However, so much of it was slow and seemingly pointless that it's a tough one to get through at first.  But if you do manage, I think you'll find yourself satisfied.  I would like to reread it someday.re, I was not surprised that the author had actually been inspired by this very series, according to the acknowledgements at the end of the book.  So that's neat.

0439023483|5.0|I can't rave about this book enough.  I don't want to summarize the book as Amazon has done so perfectly, but I had to gush over any book that I am able to enjoy as much as I enjoyed The Hunger Games. I couldn't put it down.  Katniss had my attention from the very first page.  I felt myself relating to her and sympathizing with her plight from the very beginning. And who didn't fall in love with Peeta?  He possessed such a warm heart and noble soul and somehow was able to not only hold on to both of these things but exudes them despite being right in the middle of hell.  The story is absolutely enthralling with its quick wit, fast pace, and captivating story line.  I'm amazed at Suzanne Collins's ability to mix humor, terror and romance all within the same volume.  Somehow my heart would gush for Peeta and awe at his love of Katniss while instantaneously being petrified that either would die at any moment.  This is such an entertaining and stimulating read.  I would recommend it to anyone. I can't wait for the sequel!
B001B71NOI|3.0|I give this an even 2.5 with the knowing that it'll grow on me.  First of all, when I was at work I heard 'Discipline' on a local station that plays NIN like mad (which is the only material played on the station that I doesn't drive me to throw the player out the window), and that was how I learned of this album.  I was ecstatic when 'With Teeth' arrived, loved parts of it, but pretty much couldn't and still can't stand the choice of singles from the album, the songs from which sort of now define the whole album as kind of poor.  I like 'Year Zero', though these days I'm not the NIN fanatic I once was and now I'm more casual than anything, but yet retain high respect for Mr. Reznor.  I love instrumental music, so naturally the industrial yet organic 'Ghosts' has become one of my all-time favorite albums, it's so hard to describe what value it has for me.<br /><br />But when I learned of this somewhat short album (to today's standards) with considering the quick release I couldn't bring myself to much enthusiasm, and 'Discipline' upon first hearing felt more like it was a lost track from NIN's last two vocal albums.<br /><br />The great songwriting cannot be denied on 'The Slip' for sure, but each song tends to more or less melt into a general sound of cleverly punctuated percussion and thicky guitars.  The more artsy and progressive industrial sound that had brought NIN to great value for me exists in little form here, and I feel the hasty release, which didn't hamper the great songwriting as I said before, took away from the time for each track to take on it's own unique qualities; really from track 2-6 it's programmed beats and guitar with not so much else to offer.  All the songs are great, but I can recall very few moments throughout, that is until, including the introductory instrumental, I reach track 7, a down-tempo, slightly bitter song with simple yet obviously well-constructed piano, quiet vocals and ambience, a breath of sad but fresh air.  The isolating surreal sound continues with Corona Radiata, then you're thrown into a 'Year Zero'-esque lo-fi electronic tune laced with some great live instrumentation.  Then the album ends as it had started, with more pounding and heavy strumming, but in a more industrial style with 'Demon Seed'.<br /><br />Altogether I don't love it, and I personally am beginning to feel just a little overwhelmed by the sudden change of pace of releases, but like I said before I know it'll grow on me.ntinues with Corona Radiata, then you're thrown into a 'Year Zero'-esque lo-fi electronic tune laced with some great live instrumentation.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breaking Dawn was passionate, entertaining, and Stephenie Meyer took me on a journey that I was more than happy to go on.  I loved the wedding, Isle Esme, and the whole evolution of Bella and Edward's love story. I did not want to finish the book still worrying about how things were going to work out for Bella and Edward.  In my opinion, they had been through enough!  So had Jacob.  There were still enough questions lingering in the air at the end to warrant another book if Mrs. Meyer so chooses, but I was very much entertained.  I am a 30 something wife and mother of a 13 year old, and I think I fell in love with these characters more than some of my child's teenage friends.  My only regret is that there is not a 5th book to read at this time!  One can only hope!
B00020X88O|1.0|Poor writing and bad acting can certainly make for an enjoyable camp romp.  Unfortunately, this movie did not manage to achieve that level for me.   For the most part, I found the lead female character (\\"Nomi\\") to be  unappealing, and disagreeable, which made it impossible to care very much about the story.   She was a total turn-off.  The lowest point in the entire film however is when the one truly decent human, the lead character's main friend \\"Molly\\", is brutally raped in a particularly revolting scene.  This in turn leads to a completely ridiculous retribution scene dealt out by the wretched \\"Nomi\\".  Which then leads to the best part of this film - THE END.
B000002UAU|5.0|Seeing what is probably the greatest rock album ever recorded rated at anything less than 5 stars, shows the lack of credibility of reviewers on this site.  In fact, when you look at Beatle releases on amazon.com, none of them are rated, overall, at a 5.    There should be an investigation.
B001NB6IN8|5.0|Too many people judge Fall Out Boy before they give them a good listen. Don't let your preconceived ideas ruin this album for you. Because you will be missing out on an amazing album. Sure, Fall Out Boy have changed a lot since EOWYG. But their spirit and feeling of their music remains the same. They still create the catchy melodies that are always stuck in your head. The over-the-top drums and guitar ensembles grab you from start to finish, the way only Fall Out Boy can. Patrick's voice and Pete's lyrics are at their best. It is, in my opinion, their best album yet.
0316017922|5.0|I wish I had read this book a month before now because I honestly would have purchased a copy for everyone I know for xmas.  I always believed that when you were a child if you asked a question and it was answered or you were given a book that could answer what your parents did not know you were way ahead.  This may seem like an obviously thought but if you have had a childhood where this is not the routine, if you are dismissed, and not because of bad parenting but because they simply didn't know it was important and probably didn't know the answers and were parenting as their parents had you were at a greater loss than I realized.  This book has provided me with an understanding on what this could mean to your life as an adult and your future endeavours.  And this is only the beginning of what this book had to offer.  Read it.  You will not be sorry to gain such insights.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is an amazingly colorful film, showcasing the height of Pixars CGI imagery.  This film seems reminiscent of an art-house feature with very little dialogue and beautiful scenery.  Unfortunately, Wall-E seems to take a turn for the worse (in my opinion) about midway through the film in an attempt to make it more kid friendly.  All-in-all, Wall-e is a fine film and I hope it wins the Oscar for best picture.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|Starting out with a heart-pounding car chase scene through the mountains on impossibly narrow roads with more two-way traffic than DC at rush hour, albeit with fewer guns, there is no mistaking where this movie is heading.  Bond (Craig) machine gun sprays the bad guy without blinking an eye.<br /><br />A few scenes later there's a foot-chase scene, with jumps off balconies, dives through windows, and tap-dancing on poorly manufactured tile roofing.  A high-wire trapeze fist-fight on an intricate system of scaffolding and pulleys ensues, where Bond and his nemesis display talents that could win an Olympic gold medal for gymnastics and cause vertigo at the same time.  Between yawning and checking his watch, Bond single shots the villain between the eyes.<br /><br />Up next we're introduced to the smoking hot Camille (Olga Kurylenko), and then there is another epic car-chase scene.  Camille drives a little buggy, perfect for the narrow European streets.  Bond follows on a dirt bike he just stole.  BAM!  Straight into an unbelievable boat chase scene, where Bond uses a bad guy's melon as a ramp, and causes more water deaths than the Titanic.<br /><br />Oh, don't forget Bond can fly a plane!  Some schmuck lets him \\"borrow\\" the plane, wherein Bond takes machine gun fire from a jet and a helicopter while Camille flails around in the back like a rag doll, a gorgeous rag doll.<br /><br />WHEW!!  I was seriously waiting for a [[ASIN:B000VFVO9A Segway]] chase scene.  This is the ultimate chase scene movie.<br /><br />As for the movie, it has an interesting enough, somewhat implausible plot where the bad guys attempt to horde a resource by controlling assets in an undermining, illegal, and insidious manner.  It's up to Bond, Camille, a beautiful redhead babe who Bond beds, and the assorted cast of British spies who help Bond out along the way to stop the bad guys.<br /><br />A few of the classic elements and lines are missing, but since I'm not a huge Bond fan it wasn't too much of a letdown.  With that said, I highly recommend this intense flick for action fans, but hesitantly for hard core James Bond fans.mmend this intense flick for action fans, but hesitantly for hard core James Bond fans.
0956010903|4.0|Interesting enough to read for a modern \\"fairytale\\" sort of book, it's annotated by both Rowling and Dumbledore (that's fun to read). Her handwritten forward, this edition, is hard to read but all right otherwise, the text style is old English- also a problem for some. The stories are standard fairytale stuff, one is a bit bloody which I think the usual tales also were in their original form at times so this book might not be a good choice for young children.     The book itself comes in a very large (think largest standard type cereal box) \\"Book\\" like box which is actually more attractive than the pocket sized book itself with it's heavy metal ornamentation. It's all well made but the average \\"Potter\\" reader should just stick to the standard edition- much better value for the money.

B001BR5F4C|5.0|offcourse, at this point.. most people have already seen Kill Bill.. if you still haven't.. then stop reading this and go watch it right now.. if you've already seen it.. then you're probably reading this because you want to watch the film in HD. To be honest.. the blu-ray version of kill bill surpassed my expectations.. it's just perfect.. the picture is crystal clear.. no noise grain (which is often irritating in many other blu-ray releases)..  it has non uncompressed audio.. and the whole experience of watching this particular release was just perfect. In Kill Bill.. Tarantino was particularly focusing heavily on the color palette in EACH shot of the film.. and watching it in on blu-ray lets the viewer see the film in the exact way the director intended.. also the usage of light and shadow in the film was brilliant.. unlike what you would see in any other film.. which also looks very good in this particular release.. I recommend this to any kill bill fan out there..

0316017922|4.0|Gladwell argues that the notion of a \\"self made man\\" is a half-truth and that success is often the result of subtle advantages and chance opportunities (oh yes, combined with ability and hard work). His anecdotes are amusing and compelling, but they remain anecdotes, not data, selected to make his point. He acknowledges the obvious importance of hard work and the willingness to take advantage of opportunities, but emphasizes factors external to the individual. I do not disagree that subtle and accidental advantages contribute to success and can probably be identified retrospectively in most outliers. He persuasively makes his point about a perspective that often is ignored. My concern is that Gladwell supports his hypothesis so eloquently that individual factors, like innate ability and hard work, could be ignored, which I don't think was the point of the book. He makes his argument very well, maybe too well.
1416562591|5.0|I've lived in India (Mumbai) for 14 months. This is by far the best and most moving book about modern India that I've read, be it fiction or non-fiction.  Every sentence rings true.  There are some other wonderful modern Indian novels such as Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" and Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children.\\"  But this book speaks in the voice of the great oppressed mass of Indian people who are striving and struggling to survive and maybe, somehow, thrive.  It's a compact and powerful statement of one man's refusal to stay in the Darkness, and his insistence that he too is worthy of the Light, no matter what the cost.  Read this book if you want to know about the real India that 75% of its people actually live in.  Highest recommendation.
B001F12J48|1.0|I had to go to several stores to find the 3D version and was excited to watch it - Polar Express is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  We put the glasses on over our eyeglasses and were immediately disappointed.  We even tried wearing our eyeglasses on top of the cardboard ones and that didn't really help.  The quality was poor, the ghosting lines, blotches and the colors were all washed out.  We were really disappointed.  Yes, we could see the additional dimension sometimes, but it gave me a headache at first to get adjusted.  I'd stick to the Blu-Ray 2D version.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin DeGraw just has that voice that makes you want to stop and listen. I LOVE his music and the emotion he puts into his songs. His lyrics are powerful and catchy, and perfect for the long drive to work. The stripped cd is everything I had wanted and hoped for in a cd. 5 stars!
073935650X|4.0|I'm using this novel with my 9th and 10th graders, and figured it would be great for them to listen along as they read.  The fact that the story was done in 2 voices is wonderful!  It's set up extremely well.  The only problem that I have with it is that the woman who portrays the voice of Hannah sounds much older than a high school student, and almost a little bit whiney.  Other than that, it's a great book to compliment the novel, or just listen to on your own.
B001D08SK0|5.0|Kind of Blue is to Jazz what thriller is to pop music and that is all you need to know about the importance,depth and overall artistic merits and timeless quality that you shall find here upon listen after listen. Miles Davis made a album that connected where he was at with his career up until that point when he made \\"Kind of Blue\\". so many of these songs have been covered or re-done. very cool and classy is the tone and arrangement vibe throughout this whole set. the dvd is a must have and it doesn't matter how many times this particular album is released or put out, because it is a historic piece of art to me and is timeless.hard to believe it's 50 years old because it sounds so much lively than most of what is released today to me.this is a standard album.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|This movie is garbage, plain and simple.  It's an endless bore.  The story could easily be told in 10 minutes, but this thing is 153 minutes!  And it feels more like 4 hours.  It goes on and on and on.<br /><br />Bale is terrible as Batman, if you can even call this interpretation of the character Batman - more like Robo-Bat.  Whenever he's in the costume, he puts on this gravely voice that is so over the top, it totally destroys any scene he has to speak in.  He sounds crazier than Joker most of the time.  And the Batman costume looks like something you would see in a cheapo Godzilla movie.<br /><br />A lot of fuss was made about Ledger's performance - but its nothing special at all - just a combination of E.G. Robinson' Little Ceaser and Carey's the Mask.  If you don't believe me, rent Little Ceaser and you'll also see what a good movie is like at the same time.<br /><br />But the real prize for terrible acting and casting goes to Maggie Gyllenhaal who has absolutely no business being in feature films.  She is terrible in the part, and plain old hard on the eyes.  Who does she know?<br /><br />I've seen all of the Batman movies, but the Dark Knight is far and away the worst entry in the series.  Its just not a well made movie, saved from the poor reviews it deserved by the misfortune of Ledger's death.

B000G0O5N2|5.0|I have about twenty blu-ray titles now and I have to say that this particular transfer has got to be the best that I've seen.  Super clear, super sharp.  You can see the specks of individual dust particles in the streets, the pores in the character's faces, beads of sweat on skin before it gets big enough to role down...  It was like I was looking through a 46-inch window into a live action scene!<br /><br />The quality of the transfer from film to blu-ray in this movie will show you the power of 1080p in all it's stunning glory and make you a believer.<br /><br />And oh, the movie isn't too bad either... ;)

1878424319|5.0|This is a short book, about 130 pages. But like high-grade explosives, powerful things come in small packages. This book is spiritual C4: it will break down barriers in your mind and your heart, and blow open the doors of opportunity within yourself.    /The Four Agreements/ builds a framework for discussing our world and our spiritual problems. The framework consists of \\"dreams\\" -- my dream, your dream, our family's dream, society's dream, etc. The author, don Miguel Ruiz, wants you to see that your world is your dream. A sunny day can be a happy one, or a sad one, depending on how you see it. A blustery, windy, snowy winter day can be happy or sad, productive or pointless, depending on your view and how you wield your energy.    However, Ruiz also points out that our minds and our hearts are dominated by a tug-of-war between the voices of every parent, teacher, TV commercial, textbook, failed relationship, and experience that became ingrained in us and carried with us as mental luggage. These unspoken \\"agreements\\" with the voices and pressures in our spirit can be broken and replaced with the Four Agreements.    1. Be Impeccable With Your Word. Your words and actions are the painter's brush, which can fill the canvas of your day with wondrous dreams or with hellish nightmares. Use your power to promote good will, for yourself and for others. Cast a spell of heaven, not a black magic spell of hell.    2. Don't Take Anything Personally. This doesn't mean you walk away from responsibility for your actions. You just agree not to internalize the negativity (or ego-inflating positivity) of what other people do. Often when others shout at you, they are really just shouting at themselves or a voice in their head.    3. Don't Make Assumptions. Your mind can create whole fictions that are very convincing. Don't assume anything -- make yourself and your situation clear, and all drama and misunderstanding will vanish.    4. Always Do Your Best. Whatever your \\"best\\" is in anygiven moment, do it. Don't create unnecessary friction by resisting the things that must be done, and don't create guilt or problems for yourself later by doing things halfway. There's no guilt if you do your best, even if it's not always enough.    /The Four Agreements/ is bound in a series of linear pages, but in reality the book is a perfect circle that you can loop through again and again to understand things more deeply. Reading any one page of this book will fill you with magic. Each time you open it and read a little, you will come away with a feeling of personal power.    Whether you think you have a happy life or not, I recommend this little gem. If nothing else, it will leave you with a sense of strength that can only make your daily life better.

I didn't really like the last album though either I must say, but this one I was expecting her to finally do better. Dangerously in Love was a great ablum, but she has gone downhill from there. Beyonce is so talented and pretty, but never can seem to get it right. Being pretty is only going to get you so far. It's time to stop focusing so much on booty poppin and grinding, and time to start concentrating more on your music. Beyonce is not a song writer. There is absolutely nothing wrong with stepping away from something and letting someone who knows what they are doing take control. And Ave maria? What in the world? Beyonce the people who buy your album do not want to hear this. When you are 75 and recording songs for fun, then yea. But you need to get some people around you that are going to tell you the truth and say WTF? Halo is pretty, and so is Disappear. But the rest...put me to sleep. Go back to what you know. Because this new stuff isn't really working out.
B00005JPTK|2.0|I Am Legend (2007) Will Smith stars in this third movie version of Richard Matheson's classic 1954 science fiction novel. Will plays Robert Neville, here an Army colonel/scientific researcher stuck in a world decimated by a virus that was created to cure cancer. Although he is the last man on earth, he is not alone in the world. He spends his days working on a cure for the virus, and his nights locked away in a secret fortress, hiding from what mankind has become: crazed vampiric creatures with little resemblance to their former human existences. Neville's only companion is his faithful dog Sam. Three years after the outbreak they live in New York City, with plant life and herds of wild deer beginning to encroach on what was once man's domain. Based on Men in Black and Independence Day, Will Smith + Science Fiction = Big Budget Entertainment with Lots of Effects and Hilarious Wisecracks. This time, an actor wanting to stretch himself and a more downbeat story means no wisecracks. As a result, this is an impressively mounted movie with a very good central performance, but the lack of interaction and rather dour proceedings keep this one from scoring a bullseye. The two previous versions of the story (including The Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price and The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston) have their moments and are worth a watch for those so inclined, with Last Man scoring highest as an adaptation of the novel since it sticks closest to it. It is mainly hampered by a budget too small for its ambitions and being made in English by Italians. The Omega Man is fun in the way only science fiction action movies from this period starring Charlton Heston can be. This third version has all the CGI visuals money can buy but changes Matheson's story a lot (too much?) and has a tacked on \\"moviemaking-by-committee\\" finale that doesn't work very well. The film's original ending wouldn't have been much better, still differing from the novel's a lot. A combination of the two would have been the best bet but until Hollywood decides to release a series of \\"Craig Edwards Cut\\" DVD's you'll have to ask me what that would have been. So, in the end, this is worth a look for Will Smith fans, as long as they don't expect many laughs or lighter moments but instead a bleaker movie experience.the two would have been the best bet but until Hollywood decides to release a series of \\"Craig Edwards Cut\\" DVD's you'll have to ask me what that would have been.

B000IFQLSW|4.0|I was pleasantly suprised at the quality and sound of this guy. I'd never heard of him, but was intrigued by the idea of going out and playing with some old time blues players. Kenny Wayne Sheperd is fairly young, but has a great blues touch. The DVD is a nice bonus, what I've seen of it so far.     The tracks make you want to get out your guitar, and figure out the licks.
B001NRZIAG|5.0|It's really sad that this is Atlantis' final season, as their stories are only getting better -- the writing is tighter, the characters developed and emotional.  Such drama was only bested by Galactica and Stargate SG1.<br /><br />Jennifer is taken over by a thief who was messing around with the same Ancient communication device that Daniel messed with when he discovered the Ori.  That lead to a huge story arc.  On Atlantis, it leads to attempted murder and possible loss of a loved one.<br /><br />Can't wait for future episodes.

B001GZ6QDS|2.0|I'm so disappointed with \\"The Dark Knight\\". The film is just such a pointless mess that it's hard to begin to explain why. The special effects and photography is excellent, but that's about it. Here are the main flaws, as I see it:     First of all: It's not believable. With this I don't mean that a movie about Batman must be totally realistic. But the problem here is that after watching an hour or something, I get the feeling that 'anything can happen' in this particular Gotham-universe. And that is a problem because if 'anything can happen' there is no logic to anything and that makes me lose interest (even fantasy worlds like Tolkien's or Lovecraft's have a certain logic that makes them 'believable' - you feel you are there as a viewer/reader). The Joker can do what he wants, he's like some kind of supernatural being, and after a while it's just tiresome to see him blowing everything up and implement totally implausible plans (where are his allies, there must be millions of them, with clairvoyance and time machines and stuff like that...?). It all feels like a confusing dream where people die and come back, pop up in the most implausible locations and where time and gravity is totally out of joint. In a bad way.     Second: Too much action crammed in. Big events and extreme situations are just heaped upon one another in such a pace that it just becomes tiresome.     Third: the characters are uninteresting. In \\"Batman Begins\\" the plot was less chaotic and the characters were more interesting. I mean, the Joker may be the result of a lot of creative effort from a Ledger and make up artists, but in the end I don't care about who or what he is. Also, I don't care about Batman, Bruce, Alfred, Gordon, Dent or anyone else either. They are, again, not believable in any way and the 'anything can happen-universe' contributes to this.     Fourth: Why does Batman has to speak with a silly voice? (Here I'm asking the same question as the Joker: - why so serious?)     Fifth: the movie is too long for its own good.     In the end I actually think \\"Iron Man\\" is a far better movie! And talking Batman I think \\"Batman Begins\\" is superior to this barely watchable mess.     The picture on the DVD is good, and there is also a whole extra disc with extra material. The problem is I don't have the energy to watch any of this. I will give away this DVD, the question is to whom? I give this two weak stars.
B00005JMX6|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A fairly standard, if dirtier, teen flick, The Girl Next Door is almost completely forgettable and not worth seeking out unless you're seeking disposable entertainment.
0375826726|3.0|So the story starts out with Eragon having many vows he has to keep. And he get's working on them. Like the first one to his brother Roran about saving Roran's fiancée Katrina. Eragon set's off to all the same places in this. He has issues staying in one place for too long. He went to the crowning of a new dwarf king to an old friend dying. He got around.   This book was a pretty good book to read even for a freshman. I know it says this book is fourth grade level book but even if it is I still enjoyed reading it. Christopher Paolini has done an amazing job with this series. I would personally have to say Eragon was my favorite then this one. Except I would have liked it if it ended here because I don't feel like waiting for the next book. But I guess he just had a lot to say.   There isn't too much to say now other than the fact that I liked the book I recommend it to those of you who have read the first 3 books. This isn't a book where you can just jump in because you will get lost. Fantasy lovers will enjoy it, it's full of action and adventure exactly what every good book has to have.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though the director's cut detracts from the movie, The Warriors is an exciting and stylish urban western about a gang of Coney Island toughs who have to fight all night just to get home; a deserved cult classic, the film is a must-see for anyone who likes well-made action movies.
B00003CXTF|5.0|To be honest,I really don't care what the critics or the people who gave  nothing but praise to James Cameron's god-awful Titanic but literally  bashed this FAR SUPERIOR MOVIE to bits think.Blasphemy,you may say.But  not when you really examine both films!The whole point behind the true  tragic stroy of the Titanic is what the ship's creators boasted in real  life history,'God Himself cannot sink this ship.'But Cameron totally  blunders this by having everyone taking God's name in vain left and  right while the ship is going down.When in real life history,they were  all singing:'Nearer my God to thee.'And not only that,Cameron tries to  make us feel all broken when Leonardo Dicaprio's character kicks the  bucket,but when you really analize it from a realistic,not to mention  moral point of view he deliberately took advantage of Kate Winslet's  character who is already engaged to Billy Zane's character.True,Zane's  character does try to go about winning Kate's heart in the materialistically way.But all Kate had to do was tell him in the right way  I want your love not what your money can buy.So,in all honesty Leo is  in fact the REAL VILLAIN!At least in PEARL HARBOR,the love triangle  was handled far better!Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale's characters  fall hopelessely in love with each other during extremely-troubled  times.But at least,Ben's character is noble enough not to try to take  away her virginity until they can get married.And when his plane is  shot down,Ben is presumed dead.This naturally tears up not only Kate's  heart but Josh Hartnett's as well,who plays Ben's best friend since  they were kids.Though Josh does indeed do wrong by getting Kate's  character pregnant when they're not even married!He does finally  realize the error of his ways and is torn not only for his love  for Kate but also the brotherly-love that he has for Ben,  especially when it turns out that Ben is not dead at all!The  movie does have profanity in it,including God's name in vain,  so Christians be warned ahead of time before you decide to purchase it.But still keep in mind,PEARL HARBOR does still have a lot of redemptive qualities in it,than the James Cameron TRAVESTY!!!!!!!
B000TGJ80S|3.0|The Bottom Line:    This version of Dracula is stylishly put-together but marred by poor performances (Reeves and an over-the-top Hopkins) and the lack of a soul beneath its slick interior.
B001H5X7KC|1.0|premetto che non amo Stiller, però pensavo di passare una piacevole serata..........invece, a parte l'ottima interpretazione di Donwey il resto lascia molto a desiderare. voleva essere una denuncia a Hollywood e al mondo  del cinema ma............sinceramente comunque un film MOOOOOLTO sopravalutato. (si sa, Hollywood adora dare una seconda occasione ai cattivi ragazzi, vedi Donwey, Rourke, ecc... alcuni eccellenti attori altri...lasciamo perdere)
B00004WEJZ|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A little on the long side, with a lead actor who's a little long in the tooth, Never Say Never Again nevertheless succeeds due to a winning sense of humor and several standout scenes; put it this way, it's at least better than Octopussy.
B00003W8NM|5.0|allora, penso di averlo visto una decina di volte e, ogni volta, mi piace sempre di più! Brad Pitt è bravissimo ma l'anima del film è Edward Norton uno dei più talentusi attori in circolazione oggi. (dimenticavo, con Pitt ci doveva essere anche Norton, per il premio al miglior carattere stilato da Empire, perchè alla fine Tyler Durden è Norton-Pitt)
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A rather middling sequel to The Bourne Identity which suffers from the loss of Chris Cooper and Clive Owen (as villains) and Franka Potente (as love interest), the Bourne Supremacy is only supreme when it comes to mediocrity.
B001AACEP8|4.0|Didn't know this was the \\"clean\\" version before I downloaded it; I would have preferred the explicit version, so I docked one star since it wasn't labeled as such.    I think Amazon should label an album \\"clean\\" or \\"explicit\\" when there's a choice, for clarity's sake. They do label explicit albums tho.
B001AEF6BI|3.0|The Bottom Line:    An inexplicably beloved film, the Breakfast club features a cast of 20-somethings plodding their way through Saturday detention, grappling with their tortured adolescence and cliched evil teacher while they make small strides towards becoming decent human beings instead of one-note stereotypes.
0894803123|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book based on the reputation of Ben and Jerry's Ice Creams.  I was VERY disappointed that this book, published in the 1980's, features many recipes that call for whole raw eggs that don't get  cooked !!  Was there no problem with salmonella back then?  I would have expected them to update the book or tell the home cook how to make an acceptable substitution.  Better yet, when we buy Ben and Jerry's I can't believe the FDA allows them to sell a product that has uncooked eggs in it.  If they have made adjustments they should have let the book buyer in on it.
078324228X|4.0|The Bottom Line:    If historical inaccuracies and biases are ignored and The Hurricane is viewed simply as a movie, it succeeds quite well: though a tad overlong, it's a solid bit of prison and human drama.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|This movie was pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be. It had some funny lines and take offs on Viet Nam genre and a heck of a cast. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise stole the show totally. Ben Stiller was ok but just ok like he is in most of his movies.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good but not the over the top laugh fest I thought it would be.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|The Bottom Line:    As long as you don't take this modern-day fairy tale literally you'll have a heck of a time; combining laughs, romance, and a bit of pathos into one of the shortest-seeming 2+ hours movies ever made, Love Actually is well-worth checking out.
B00005LC4Z|5.0|Bought as a gift. Received in good shape.  Shipping was a little slow but, it was worth the wait.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Consistently amusing and often hilarious, Eurotrip can be forgiven for spending far too much time on some sequences (e.g. the \\"robot fight\\") because of its generally-likable characters, lack of fecal humor, and moments of inspired comedy.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|This well casted period piece gives us a good look into one of the most famous writers of childrens books. Beatrix Potter was an amazing woman and Ren'ee Zellwegger plays her incredibly well. She shows us her quirks and unwielding believe in her animal characters. We see her talent in her style of painting them and creating stories about them. Ewan McGregor plays her publisher with style and heart. I was drawn into her life story and found myself wanting more after the end of the movie. A romance and drama that is mostly lighthearted. A great documentary and other extras are included to fill you in even more. I highly recommend this entertaining story of Beatrix Potter. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Finding Forester\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
B0006SSOHC|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Saw begins promisingly by thrusting the viewer into a dirty basement with the two main characters, but quickly builds up so many plot holes that a good deal of the sequels' running lengths are devoted to clearing them up; if you like your horror leavened awful acting and nonsensical plotting, by all means check out Saw.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I loved the movie and on someone's advise I got the soundtrack I am so glad I did. Although this type of  music is not my cup of tea (I love country). I found it has a great beat and I could listen and enjoy it. I love the song Go all the way into twilight I find myself singing it all the time. The one song that I can live with out is Rob Pattinson's song Never Think  on the soundtrack. Though he makes a great vampire his singing is not for me.   All in all this a great soundtrack for all ages
B000AP04FG|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A star vehicle and nothing more, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is reminiscent of Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief: both movies seem to feel that watching sexy stars interact is inherently interesting when all the evidence points to the contrary.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Clint Eastwood has a way of redefining genres. What his unforgettable Unforgiven did for westerns, Gran Torino very well may do for dramas. He loves to head fake his audience as he cleverly sidesteps stereotypical characters and concepts. You think you know Clint Eastwood, think again.<br /><br />This isn't Dirty Harry or Josey Wales, nor is it Million Dollar Baby or Mystic River. This is come to expect the unexpected 21st century Clint Eastwood. Like a vintage wine, he keeps getting better with age. And like the Gran Torino in \\"Gran Torino\\" this is a modern day classic that glistens in the sun.<br /><br />Without giving away too much let me just say be prepared to laugh your a** off, repeatedly throughout most of the movie. And then be ready to stand up and applaud when he head fakes you again at the end. And then just smile and shake your head as he sings us through the credits.<br /><br />One of the better (and funnier) flicks of the year.
B00009W0WM|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A deserved classic that will appeal to even the most black-hearted cynic, Casablanca succeeds due to an emphasis on characters set against a fascinating backdrop--believe the hype.
B00068CVJ4|4.0|This is a good album.  Being a big Mars Volta fan, I find a lot to like about it.  Its no MV though.  Its like being in the car on the way to the beach when you really want to be at the beach.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The more you know about zombie movies the funnier you'll find this inspired homage to/spoof of them; Romero would be proud of the way Wright and co. mix gore and humor with just a dash of sly social commentary.
B00000DHR0|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite Christmas CDs despite many of the criticisms of song selection (I agree, some just don't belong).  I'm not a huge fan of Celine's music but I really enjoy her performance on this CD.  The problem is that the recording quality is, at times, extremely poor.  You can actually hear wow and flutter (or their equivalent) on a CD, and incredible distortion at other times.  Thinking this was a defective CD, I bought two more, and the exact same problems occur at the same moments played on 4 different high end (home) audio systems.    It's a shame a performance of this caliber had to be tarnished by such terrible attention to audio fidelity.  These are the producer's and recording engineer's failures.  Celine's performance is very good in my opinion, and despite the audio failures, is a seasonal favorite of mine.
B00005JMYI|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Though not as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, Anchorman excels only in proving that people find stupidity funny for its own sake; the movie's appeal stems largely from lines like \\"I love lamp\\" which have no inherent humor value unless one is a 12-22 year-old male.
B00000DHR0|4.0|Yes, it's Celine Dion.    I know that people have their negative opinions of Celine, and I have some to as I am only a moderate fan. However, I must say that this album is thoroughly enjoyable. Christmas albums are often dismissed as just a safe piece of product to earn some cash. While this album is pretty safe (like most of Celine's releases), it's supposed to be for enjoyment around the holidays and Christmas albums are supposed to be light. Her voice and her style of music work well for the seasonal genre. Standout tracks include:    \\"Don't Save It All For Christmas Day\\" - an original Christmas ballad about showing love all year round, and not just on Christmas.  \\"Brahm's Lullaby\\" - a very soothing rendition of this classic lullaby. She sounds very good went her voice is restrained.  \\"Blue Christmas\\" - a fantastic jazzy remake of the song made popular by the King, Elvis Presley. I love his version, and Celine does this song justice.  \\"The Prayer\\" -  This is a duet with Andrea Bocelli. They both have really strong voices yet different musical styles so they compliment each other.   \\"I'm Your Angel\\" - This #1 hit isn't a Christmas song, but it fits well with this CD. R. Kelly sounds great, and this unlikely duet is very nice. I'm not surpirsed it was a huge success.    So, I can honestly say that this CD is good. Regardless if you are a big fan or not, I think you will actually enjoy this album. Give it a chance.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Wooden performances by the protagonist Wahlberg and antagonist Norton (who by his own admission had no interest in doing the film) overcome a sometimes clever updating of 1969's The Italian Job; it's a fun enough watch but not a memorable film.
0743289692|5.0|This book is amazing not only does it expose the horrible things that happens to women in the islamic faith it shines a light on the treatment and stereotypes of women worldwide. She does not write this book with ill intent or malice. The tone is never one of hatred. Her goal is not to teach you to loathe Islam but to understand the ridulousness of it all! And being a former christian there is ridiculousness there as well! Thankfully not as bad as in the Islamic faith! I will say I had nightmares after reading this book. I dreamed I was being attacked by an Imam or Ma'alim coming after me. I was very happy to wake up an American woman. This is an excellent read and I totally suggest it!...aside from the nightmares and just an FYI some of the scenes in this book are brutal!
B0000YEEGM|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A fairly middling film lifted out of its mediocrity only by the star power generated by Tom Cruise and a very good Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man is too long, too slow, and too uninteresting to be considered a good movie, much less a classic.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|As always, Enya presents a beautiful and enchanting collection of songs. \\"And Winter Came\\" will definitely be included in my playlist for the holidays!
B0007Y08IS|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A cheerfully-irreverent satire which isn't afraid of going over the top, Team America targets the political status quo, the formulaic action film, and the musical \\"Rent,\\" among other, in its (mostly sucessful) attempts to make us laugh.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in my lifetime and I have seen so many. What made it stand out from among the others is that it has a lot of heart. Great script,acting, direction, production design and musical score. The soundtrack is also a must buy. Everything about this movie hits the spot. It is one of the few movies that deserves several viewing. A fair warning to everyone, this movie is addictive.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though the movie sometimes suffers from too-quick jumps in time and the fact that the main characters are universally despicable, it is still worth watching due to the high caliber of the acting and writing.
B001E75QGG|1.0|You can not even blame Harrison Ford's age for this disaster. The blame lies directly with Spielberg and Lucas for this pathetic attempt. From the flying fridge to the monkey rescue, this movie is worse than the last installment of The Mummy series. Poor effects and horrible script. I saw it opening weekend and twenty minutes into it I was looking at my watch and counting the minutes.     However, I do hope they release another one because the current pattern dictates that the next one should be a classic. Raiders was, Temple of Doom was painful, Last Crusade was fantastic, and Crystal Skull was trash. If the pattern continues, the next one should be worth checking out.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|The Bottom Line:    An uninspired, formulaic comedy featuring a nuetered, family-friendly Will Farrell, Elf offers a few amusing gags, a sweet performance by Zooey Deschanel, and little else.
B00005JKHP|3.0|i used to be a HARDCORE trekker/trekkie now i don't watch as much as i used to but still watch sometimes so i wanted to complete my collection
0767802470|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Das Boot is a very entertaining and engaging submarine movie that doesn't feel long even at 200+ minutes; marred only by occasionally-bad special effects, (all the scenes in the conning tower look thoroughly studio-bound) it introduces characters worth caring about and then runs them through a thrilling gauntlet.
B000F6IOBQ|4.0|This is a great movie and I can't recomend this enough to any fan of the series and any fan of the vampire genre in general.
B00080ZG10|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The Aviator looks great and features good performances, but it is painfully long, has middling special effects, and doesn't seem to notice that it spans 30 years without many of its characters aging.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Excellent series.  Well done with lots of extras.  Comes with a nice tin box as well.
6305313687|5.0|The Bottom Line:    American History X is a terrific film; though the director may have tried to distance himself from the final product, the movie is well-directed, well-acted, and well-constructed.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Buffalo Springfield will always have their place in Rock and Roll history.  Stephen Stills and Neil Young used the group as their launching pad for bigger and better things.  For what it's worth, Mr. Soul, Bluebird, Questions, Special care, Broken arrow and others remain classics.  Unfortunately the band had trouble getting along so we have only three albums to listen to. Neil Young infact had already left the group when \\"Last time around\\" which was their last album was released.  If you want the best of Buffalo Springfield, here it is.......
0792165020|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though Matt Damon's Tom Ripley is not nearly as interesting as every other actor/character around him, the movie succeeds in being interesting for 135 minutes and is a worthy thriller.
B000000WJK|5.0|Sad to say, the Verve will never be like this again:  simple, abstract lyrics (\\"Signs are right/The signs are here/Who needs virtual world/<br />When I can see it now\\"  ...ah!); unabashedly effects-laden and layered guitars- murky and illuminated, surging and soaring all at once; drifting, featherlight vocals giving way to rock bellowing.  Lilting, delicate compositions mixed with roaring chaos, ebb and flow. Swagger and sensitivity, hollering and hushes.  This album sounds exactly like its title.<br /><br />Their subsequent albums have had their good points, but they sounded like an entirely different band.  Perhaps serendipitously, circumstances led to Verve becoming THE Verve after this album, and in turn a whole short-lived era was put to rest. Birth, life, death, all in this genius first album- how perfect.
B000066AXE|4.0|The Bottom Line:    An often-moving story, A Beautiful Mind sometimes rambles or takes too long on a dead end of a plotline, but deserves praise for taking one of the most formulaic genres (the biopic) and doing something completely different, mainly successfully.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I'm a classical musician w/ graduate degrees in music performance.  Even with the very high level of musical critique that happens naturally when I listen to any type of music, I still managed to thoroughly enjoy this CD.<br />  To be quite honest, I don't enjoy very many \\"artists\\" in popular music...either because they don't have a good command of the fundamentals, or they don't respect music as an art form.<br />  Like Alanis Morrisette (very talented in musical expression), Adele is one of those people in popular music whom I actually regard as a musician.  I love the influence of the great jazz singers of yesteryear, in her singing.<br />  From a musician's standpoint, it is very refreshing to hear an actual accomplished musician in popular music.  She has an excellent understanding of the fundamentals...this isn't exactly a basic fundamental, but she \\"bends\\" notes really well:) To hear someone in this realm of music actually understand what she's doing is very special.  She'd be a shoe-in for a grammy, if winning a grammy was based on quality of musicianship.<br />  In my opinion, she (by far) surpasses most of the very seasoned entertainers in popular music.  I'd put her next to actual musicians in this genre, like Mariah Carey (vocal technique), Alanis Morrisette (tuning isn't all that great, but gifted in musical expression), Javier Colon (fantastic tuning and command of high range), or maybe even a Renee Fleming.  Hopefully she will continue to work and get better.
B000957O82|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Though fans of the romantic comedy might like seeing Will Smith work his charm on Eva Mendes, anyone who prefers that movies make an attempt to rise above formulaity will be disappointed.
B001JL2UYI|3.0|I received the item the other day and could not wait to listen to this version.  I own the original import (nude cover), and the 1997 remaster, the best one IMHO.<br /><br />The print advertising I saw said that it was in 5.1 DTS, and contained 2-track PCM audio.  So, if you are into Hi-Res sound this looked like a winner.  The product info here at Amazon seems incomplete.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the DVD did not contain a 5.1 remix of the album, but an extended \\"Making of..\\" culled from the original Classic Albums release.  To their credit, the video is crisp, and that is in 5.1 DTS or PCM.  The video is very informative, special guests like Jack Cassidy & Steve Winwood add a lot.<br /><br />The CD on the other hand, remastered again, sounded flat with limited imaging and no depth to the soundstage.  Tape hiss seemed very loud as well.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />I can understand that tampering with Jimi's original 2 channel mix could be heresy, therefore no 5.1 mix.  But, an uncompressed 2-channel PCM audio version would be stunning, maybe some day.<br /><br />The packaging is good, but 3 stars, for my 3rd edition, is all it deserves in my rating.
B00011RPB0|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though the movie's attempts at broad comedy (e.g. the \\"engrish\\" speaking prostitute) often fall painfully flat, the May-November scenes between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray work so well that they more than overcome the movie's faults.
B00006CXSS|1.0|I bought this set last week and found that disk #1 would not play in my machine. All the others did. I returned it, got a replacement and the same problem. Anyone else having trouble with disk 1?
B000AM6OQ2|2.0|The Bottom Line:    A really pretty terrible movie that is inexplicably beloved, The Fog sandwiches one or two effective scenes between reams of plot exposition and corny acting; only the \\"so bad it's good\\" effect saves the movie from an even lower grade.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Love it, bought it and enjoying it! my favs :<br /><br />So what<br />I Don't Believe You<br />Please Don't Leave Me<br />Bad Influence<br />Funhouse<br />Mean<br />Ave Mary A
B00005QW5X|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Decent, if thoroughly off-the-wall, for the majority of its running length, \\"Hedwig\\" flies off the rails in a disappointing conclusion that leaves the viewer with the impression that the filmmakers didn't know where to take their eccentric German transsexual wannabe rocker.
B001J53X9U|2.0|The Blu-ray discs are stored in the slim case which is placed by the Batpod. If you want to put your Batpod on your desk or in a display cabinet, the discs will not be sitting with your movie collection. This is my main gripe because I like all my movies in one place. The DVD which contains Digital Copy comes in a sleeve. In short you don't get any typical Blu-ray/DVD case.    The Batpod itself is a bit small, and looks like typical Chinese workmanship. If you really want a Batpod, I would suggest buying the normal Blu-ray version that comes in Blu-ray's blue case, and get a bigger, quality Batpod from else where.     The movie is a solid 5 star.
B000AP04L0|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Perhaps not the call-to-arms that office drones think it is, Office Space is a funny and warm comedy about the drudgery of modern life that captures the stiflingness of white collar toil better than Fight Club ever could.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Still the BEST show out there. Looks great in Blu-ray with no commercials. A must have for any Lost fan.
B000063JDE|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A bizarre fever-dream of a movie, Blue Velvet succeeds in its attempts to shock and provides several memorable scenes, but the glossy exterior hides its lack of interesting characters and a soul.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I really haven't been crazy about any of their releases since And Justice for all. This release has the energy of the old stuff with the polish of the new stuff. The sound quality could be better, and you would expect that from such an established band, but perhaps that is what they were shooting for. It is, however, the only reason I am not giving it the full 5 stars.
B000VECAC6|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Despite a solid premise, Life of Brian consists mainly of uninspired stretches of comedy that stretch on too long in an attempt to milk every joke for all they're worth.
0956010903|5.0|I know this kinda late to make a review on this amazing book.  But I just recently got my copy since I'm in the other side of the world (Philippines). I usually receive my packages 1 month after I order my books so I was expecting it to arrive in January.  I was surprised that it came to me so early, before Christmas. I was so excited when I got the box, an early Christmas present for myself. I already knew the stories from the Amazon review (before they decided to make replicas to the actual piece that they acquired to over 4 Million).  I was just admiring the packaging, the details of the silvers. I had a big grin on my face endulging on what I just got. I am overly glad to have bought the book when I first saw it in the pre-order list. I had no regrets spending $100 for such a small book with a huge packaging, it's greatly satisfying.  Perhaps I should make a glass case for this one, it's so precious.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|The Bottom Line:    After a spectacular opening, Sky Captain devolves into a disappointingly routine movie that is still (barely) worth recommending due to its intriguing visuals and nostalgic feel.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book.  I was born in 1942 in Denmark in the middle of the German occupation.  Of course, I can't remember a thing from that time---but this book brought back all the stories my parents and my family told me of the five terrible years.<br />I have given the book to four of my friends for Christmas.  I got it for myself on \\"Kindle\\", but I think I'll buy it in book-form, just to be able to hold it in my hand.  This book is a keeper!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Zombie-czar George A Romero delivers one of the best all-around horror movies ever made in Dawn of the Dead, a film which combines solid characterization, skillful direction, and sly social commentary with exploding heads, severed arms, and buckets of blood.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I missed out on Wall-E while it was in theaters this summer. However I still blind-bought the Blu-ray since people had nothing but great things to say about Pixar's latest film. I'm happy to say that this is definitely one of the best Blu-ray releases that I own.     The movie itself is a masterpiece. It's one of the best movies of 2008 for sure, and I'd put it as my 2nd favorite Pixar film behind Toy Story. In addition, you get a lot of great features across the 2-disc set. The shining star is The Pixar Story, which is a documentary covering the creation and success of the animation giant that is Pixar Studios. It's eighty-something minutes long and is practically a second movie that Disney stuffed inside this release. The Pixar Story is an awesome bonus that shouldn't be missed. There's also your standard making of documentaries and some animated shorts (Wall-E related or not) that are worth checking out.    Wall-E on Blu-ray gets a definite 5-star rating and is a must buy for anyone who owns a Blu-ray player.
B00005JMJG|4.0|The Bottom Line:    With perfect performances by a vivacious Winslet and a restrained Carrey, ingenious writing/directing by Kaufmann and Gondry, respectively, clever plotting and a touching finale, Eternal Sunshine may have a clunky title, but it's one of the more original and interesting romances to come out in years.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|This movie was awesome, very violent, but awesome.  I went into the movie worrying that Batman's character would be tainted in his pursuit of Joker but nothing could have been further from the truth. Batman is the same Batman that he was in Batman Begins.  He just shows us futhermore in this movie just how noble he is.  The Joker was what made this movie so dark.  He is a formidable enemy played brillaintly by Heath Ledger.  The choices people are forced to make by the evil mastermind add an element to the story not often found in newer movies, even the good ones. It is an epic tale of good vs. evil and it actually compells you to be a better person.  That is very rare in movies today.  When it ended I was in awe of Batman.  It was a great movie despite the violence and I hope Batman 3 comes out soon!
B000SINT52|2.0|The Bottom Line:    For every good point he scores, Moore finds six bad ones--you don't need to be a conservative to find this is a very poor piece of filmmaking and, frankly, quite a bit of a bore.
031606792X|5.0|I'm a man in his 30s and I thought the books got better as the series progressed.  This book had the showdown and excitement that I was looking for at the end.  If you've thought that the books were getting worse as the series progressed, I doubt you'd like this one.  Some of the negative reviews give you spoilers off the bat with no warning, yet they miss or misconstrue important plot points, making me think they haven't actually read or only skimmed through the book.      ***** spoilers *****    Edward and Bella have their wedding and a romantic honeymoon where consummate their marriage.  Surprise!  Bella gets pregnant.  It amazes me that the 1-star reviews think that it's silly that vampires have sperm, yet they don't mind that they have venom that will convert you in three days or so.   I think it's totally believable in their world, and I think that Bella's actions are too.  She never really thought she could get pregnant, but when she did it was immediate love.  That's not surprising if you know women that have been pregnant and ready.  My argument is that Bella was only not ready because she had resigned herself to a child-less life as a vampire.  The immediate bond may have had something to do with the child's power as well, who knows?    I didn't think that Edward asking Jacob to talk Bella into getting an abortion was out of line.  Edward could not safely impregnate Bella, so of course someone else would have to if she were to have a baby safely.  Maybe it could have been in-vitro with Jacob's sperm?  Edward thought that the pregnancy would kill her and was grasping for a way to get Bella to have an abortion.    I liked how Jacob claimed his birthright and the pack split up, then their defense of the Cullens.  It kinda came as a shock after he was so ready to kill them earlier, but maybe that was all bluster and he did think Bella was dead, which he was about to kill a baby over later (which I didn't understand since the baby had no choice in the matter).I did think it was convenient that Jacob imprinted on Renesme, but it was some beautiful writing.  Jacob should have been able to get over Bella earlier in my opinion anyway.      I had been waiting for Bella's transformation since the end of the first book.  That was the first time we saw the story from the point of a vampire and the descriptions of what it was like were fascinating.  I was happy with the fact that her being a newborn wasn't difficult.  She was always painted as very mature for her age and with a mind that didn't work the same as other people, plus she had a power that might have affected her ability to resist temptations.  I liked that she was able to resist temptation, and I think that most of it was over-worrying by the Cullens and Edward trying to convince Bella not to become a vampire (and lose her soul).  It was cool to see how she could resist and that it surprised the Cullens, but she did have time to prepare and after all, Carlisle never killed and fed on a person, Rosalie never did after she killed her attackers and I think Alice abstained as well.  It must not be THAT difficult.  I loved that Bella finally mastered her power, i went back and read those parts several times after finishing the book.  I had wondered what form it would take since she first met Aro...
B00005JNTX|5.0|The Bottom Line:    This movie is most assuredly not for everyone, but if you appreciate this sort of thing you'll find a perfectly assembled movie that takes tropes from classic noir and fuses them with a modern, comic book sensability into an altogether new and brilliant creation.

B00005JNBQ|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Perhaps the dumbest movie to receive mainstream appreciation, Napoleon Dynamite not only features not plot but no humor--the audience is instead expected to laugh at constant repitions of the word \\"gosh\\" and Napoleon's uncle eating lots of steak...how funny.

B000G8NXYG|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though at 200+ minutes the movie is far too long, The Seven Samurai is well made and culminates in a skillfully directed battle scene; patient viewers may find much to treasure, but dillietantes should probably look elsewhere.

B000WVRQF4|5.0|165 years ago this week, Charles Dickens published what would become one of his most noteworthy and best-loved gifts to the world, \\"A Christmas Carol\\".        The illustrations Arthur Rackham made for this classic in 1915, with mostly lithe figures and spare coloring do great justice to the tale of an elderly miser, who, on the anniversary of his business partner's death on Christmas Eve, is forced to review his life, and is offered a final chance for redemption.    The tale of Ebenezer Scrooge could be viewed as an early novel of spiritual psychoanalysis.    After readers learn of Scrooge's character flaws--his stinginess, his cold-hearted attitude towards people, including a nephew and his wife, who are his only family--he is confronted by the ghost of his business partner, Jacob Marley, who, despite Scrooge's reluctance, shows him his long chain, explains its significance, and warns him to amend his ways.     Scrooge is visited by three spirits--the first being the child-like, white-haired Ghost of Christmas Past, who makes Scrooge retrace his steps in life, causing him to review a harsh and lonely childhood, which is tempered by consolation from his loving but ill-fated sister, Fan, his happier years as an apprentice to a man named Fezziwig, and finally, he recognizes how his singular pursuit of wealth at all costs resulted in the loss of his fiancee, Belle.     The Ghost of Christmas Present is the most joyous and festive of the apparitions.Sitting in a well-lit room at a table with a glorious bounty when he first encounters Scrooge, he escorts his elderly charge through London,  where he sees the spirit of the season among the people, and  visits the houses of his employee, Bob Cratchit, and that of his nephew, Fred. He learns of the plight of Cratchit's son, Tiny Tim, discovers how he is viewed in both households, is shown the impact of poverty among those whom he has the potential to help, and lastly warned about the consequences of Want and Ignorance.   The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, is the darkest, most foreboding of the phantoms. It is hooded, faceless, and silent as it shows the old man the possible future, pointing to significant details with a clammy hand as Scrooge realizes that he has reaped what he has sown.      Back in his bed at the end of a chilling night's journey, Scrooge sees the potential to be a better man than before. He has come to terms with his past, learns to rejoice in the present, and to create a better future for those around him.    Ebenezer...In Hebrew, the name means \\"Stone of Help\\", which may well be why Dickens chose it for one of his most famous characters.In the end, a formerly miserly old man does a fine job of becoming just that!
B00000IQC8|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The acting is raw and the direction is primitive, but Clerks manages to overcome its flaws simply by being funny and well-written--it's not a great movie, but it's definitely worth watching if you enjoy ribald humor.
B001DPC52C|5.0|In February of 2008, Dutch symphonic metal/symphonic rock band WT hit a new pentacle of their career with their innovative \\"Black Symphony\\" concert. This concert featured the Metropole Orchestra (a 60 piece orchestra), a 40-member choir, 10-foot pyrotechnics, a massive HD video screen, guest musicians such as Keith Caputo, and of course, Within Temptation. All of this chaos was led by WT light soprano/mezzo-soprano singer Sharon den Adel.    I absolutely love Sharon. Not only is she a highly talented singer, but she writes many of the songs for WT, designs her own costumes, sounds great live (and manages to sound great for two full hours), and seems to genuinely love what she does and loves her fans. Sharon just seemed so down to earth in this concert and she was very exciting to watch.    I cannot stress the epic nature of this concert enough. The best way to make you understand it is to go to youtube and watch clips from the DVD. This is how WT's music was meant to be heard: with the full power of a live symphony behind it. It added an extra dimension to the music that could not be experienced through a studio album. Many of the songs were also beefed up with more symphonic instruments and choir work to breathe new life into the songs. The newer \\"versions\\" of \\"Frozen,\\" \\"The Howling,\\" \\"Jillian (I'd Give My Heart),\\" and \\"The Heart of Everything.\\"    I especially liked the sit-down acoustic section in the middle of the concert where the band preformed their slower songs like \\"Memories,\\" \\"Somewhere,\\" and \\"Forgiven.\\" The section had a warm, intimate feel to it that helped to slow the pace of the concert down for a bit while still keeping it interesting. I particularly liked the duet performance of \\"Somewhere\\" with Anneke Van Giersbergen (Agua de Annique, ex-The Gathering). I never really liked the song before, but this version brought tears to my eyes.    There were also some old favorites mixed in with the ample songs taken from \\"The Heart of Everything.\\" The oddest choice being \\"The Other Half (Of Me)\\" from WT's days as a doom metal band. I thought it was nice of them to welcome George Oosthoek back for some good old-fashioned growling. Now, as much as I don't like growling in songs (and was grateful that WT dropped the growling really early in their career), the live performance of this song helped me to have a greater appreciation for it and for growling in general.    All of this pomp and circumstance came to an end with the performance of WT's first hit, \\"Ice Queen.\\" In a swirl of white tissue paper and blasting pyrotechnics, Sharon poured her heart into the song that first made the band famous. Virtually every fan in the audience sang along. Then, it was all over.    I have to admit that tears were in my eyes as the credits rolled. I couldn't believe that they pulled it all off. Every aspect of the concert worked perfectly together, and all of the hard work that the band must have put into it paid off. Seriously, there seem to be a ridiculous amount of elements here, but they all manage to work. \\"Black Symphony\\" is truly one of the greatest live spectacles of 2008.    The concert marked the end of WT's \\"The Heart of Everything\\" tour. The good news? The band has announced that they will begin working on a new album in 2009. It is currently slated for released in 2010.
B00028HBKC|3.0|The Bottom Line:    If you enjoy sadistic depictions of pain or feel that Christ's suffering the sentence of any common criminal was more important than his teachings than you may like this film; if you prefer not to see egregious use of slow-motion, ridiculous anachronistic jokes about tables, and 90 minutes of graphic torture than you may not.

B000Z27HLS|5.0|The actors chosen were able to tell Austen's story so well while fully embodying all the subtext inherent in the story.  It was delightful to see the story unfold rather than being forced, the acting realistic yet still somewhat ethereal.  We fell in love with the actors as much as the characters fell in love with each other.
B00005JNJV|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The best Batman movie yet made (including The Dark Knight), Batman Begins suffers only from a miscast Katie Holmes and an extremely over-the-top Tom Wilkinson as it portrays Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman about as realistically as possible; a superhero movie for the modern age.
B0000E6FRD|5.0|Two of the best movies of all time!    Twister:  Fun script, exciting scenese, great characters while the cast chases tornados across the country, and tangles with eachother throughout a fun, exciting script!    Perfect Storm:  One of the best films of all time.  A great semi-true story of fisherman on the east coast who encounter impossible conditions on their way back from a huge catch.  This movie boasts an amazing cast of actors and actresses.  What a fantastic cast!  They do not disappoint!  Clooney and Diane Lane are just a couple of the amazing people that make this an unforgettable movie.    Enjoy these two in a great combination.  You will love them!
B000002LGQ|4.0|Like a Prayer is Madonnas 1989 release and her 4th studio album is not one of my favorite Madonna albums. Still it has many fine tracks, i.e., Express Yourself, Cherish , Keep it together and Dear Jessie. I never liked like a prayer mostly because I do not like gospel music. The book-let is so so. The cover art is confusing. I have no idea what she meant with this one. We get a nice list of personnel and muisicians and who played what. The lyrics could have been in a bit larger font as I find it a bit small. The center photo is a bit strange with a pose that is supposed to mean something that I have no idea what. 4/5.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  The plot was fantastic, and it was exciting to watch it unfold.  The acting was the only thing that stopped me from giving it five stars, with a few of the actors giving subpar performances.    Overall, it was a very unique story and played out very well with the special effects and the political undertones.  Definitely worth the money!    Have fun!
B000002TQV|5.0|I bought this item because my old one is scratched and worn out.  The delivery was quick and the item was in perfect condition!
B00003CXAT|4.0|I loved Michael Crichton's book, and I never thought that the movie could come anywhere close to it, but this was a great movie!  You will love it!    The plot is intense, and actually fairly realistic in the future.  The characters are good enough that you will want to watch all of the sequels, and you will be on the edge of your seat throughout this movie.    Enjoy the flick!  You will love it!
031606792X|1.0|So many reviews here have covered all the faults with this book. But even given those issues, the ending was so anticlimactic that you end the book feeling that you've wasted your time. You're better off pretending this book doesn't exist and coming to your own conclusions with the story.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|My only regret on this film is that it is very slow going.  I enjoyed the thought of the film, and the original live events that underlie the film are incredibly interesting.    However, the film itself runs very slow, and is hard to follow.  I love the premise behind the film, and Spielberg writes a wonderful script, but it is very hard to give a film like this five stars.  That being said, it is definitely worth the money!    Enjoy!
B001EO2UKO|3.0|Dido's third album \\"Safe Trip Home\\" is filled with subtle, nuanced arrangements and thoughtful lyrical explorations about love itself and relationships and opportunities missed and settling down.<br /><br />It's a restless, searching album, and unfortunately, rather repetitive. Yes, this is Dido's weakness in general. She struggles on each release with creating a varied, invigorating listening experience. \\"Safe Trip Home\\" is probably her most sedating, coma-inducing recording to date. Barely getting above a trot with songs like \\"Quiet Times\\", \\"Grafton Street\\" and Us 2 Little Gods\\". The rest varies between a lilt and a death crawl.<br /><br />The overly long nine minute dehydrating \\"Northern Skies\\" meanders along like Moses's trek through the desert. This is not to say that the album doesn't work as a whole--it does. The entire experience fits nicely together, but it's not quite memorable. Some might say this is a mature, brooding, seductive piece of art work, but to me, who listens to all kinds of music all the time, \\"Safe Trip Home\\" is a snoozer.<br /><br />My favorite tracks (and I can always find favorite tracks on each Dido album) are: \\"Quiet Times\\", \\"Grafton Street\\", \\"Never Want To Say It's Love\\", \\"Look No Further\\", \\"Us 2 Little Gods\\" and maybe \\"Let's Do The Things We Normally Do\\".<br /><br />Next time (and hopefull not another four years from now), I'd like to see Dido experiment with her sound. I'm not saying make a dance album necessarily, but something that incorporates more rhythms and more instruments. I'm getting the feeling Dido doesn't have much range, and I'm afraid she's going to turn into Enya or Loreena McKennitt, churning out the same old same old every four or five years.<br /><br />Here's my Dido comparison chart for \\"Safe Trip Home\\":<br /><br />1999 No Angel: Three Stars<br />2003 Life For Rent: Four Stars<br />2008 Safe Trip Home: Three Stars
B001EO748M|5.0|Another great season of this series.  If you liked the first season, you will love this season!

This is a great movie that everyone should own!  Go out and buy this movie today, and enjoy watching it a few times a year!    Enjoy!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Indeed, the title speaks for itself. The feature film is an outstanding example of a concise and focused plot, believable and impressive visual effects and masterful performance from the main lead.   In regard to the product itself, I thank Amazon for the prompt delivery before the predicted date. But still, 12 days is an agony for me here in Malaysia.  Nonetheless, the quality of this blu-ray release is well worth the wait. The video and audio is nothing short of mesmerizing. I'm watching it on my PS3 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. But my only qualm is i've noticed that the video is a little grainy in parts. I wonder if this is common with every blu-ray.  On to the special features, i especially enjoyed the tie-in of the making-of documentary to its comic-book roots. Getting to know the origin and the artist and writers that have been involved with Iron Man is rather fulfilling. Also, the detailed approach in explaining the effects and such contributed much to my enjoyment. Robert Downey Jr's screen test, the theatrical trailers, hall of armors is a nice and welcomed edition. Not to mention, the BD-Live feature.  All in all, its a money well spent. Iron Man will definitely paved the way for me to own more Blu-ray releases in the future. I wholly recommend Iron Man (Ultimate Two-Disc Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray]  !!
079073639X|5.0|I thought the book was intensely boring and unrealistic.  The movie surprised me a great deal!  The incredible cast of characters made the story fun, and exciting!    I would say that this is probably how Crichton intended his script to look.  Perhaps the book would have been better if these particular actors were in the reading, but I think this book has proved that sometimes the movie can be far better than the book.    Enjoy these two hours!
B001C3KCSY|3.0|I've been a huge fan of KoL for awhile now, and I have to say this album was kind of a disappointment. It feels like they're losing what it was that made me love the band in the first place. There're a few tracks that stick out, but all are mild in comparision to anything they did on Because Of The Times. Nothing sticks out too much, and Caleb sounds kind of bland, like he's just moaning along on each song. I'm not expecting them to create the exact same sound or album each time, but for me, other than maybe 3 songs, \\"Sex On Fire\\", \\"Cold Desert\\", and maybe \\"Notion\\", the album was pretty much a dud for me.
B000P12LWY|4.0|Having a fairly good grasp of history will help you with watching this show, but if you are a history fan you will love this season!    Great story lines, and the characters are very interesting.  The main character is great, and the supporting cast will provide a lot of excitement.    I had a lot of fun researching the characters after each show so that I was up to speed on the history, but if you are not a history fan, this one might not be for you.    Have fun!
031606792X|5.0|When I ordered this book, I also ordered number three from another supplier. I ended up getting my money refunded and having to find number three somewhere else because they oversold. Before I even received the refund in my account, I had this book at my door. The shipping was so fast, and the book was in great shape. I was really impressed.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I am a huge fan of the founding fathers, and did not think there was any way that this series would disappoint me.  However, the story was dull outside of the real life large events.  The actors did not perform as well as other series and films in done in this era.  I very rarely give extremely poor reviews, but this series was just a disappointment from the first episode to the last.    On the other hand, for anyone that knows history, I love Alexander Hamilton, and this series makes him look very bad.  So, my opinion may be slightly skewed, but I found very little to like about this series.    Best Wishes.
B000N3ST7K|4.0|The music sounds \\"Muddy\\" on my system----not clear like the movie DVD.  Could what I bought be a copy of a copy?  That is what it sounds like.  It was sent from Argentina    Maybe that is the best you can get from those old recordings...    Still fun to listen to.
B000002LE6|3.0|Prince's follow-up to the triumphant \\"Sign 'O' the Times\\" is a slight letdown. \\"Lovesexy\\" (1988) certainly has its moments: \\"Glam Slam,\\" \\"Eye No,\\" \\"Anna Stesia,\\" \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" and the extended \\"Alphabet St.\\" Unfortunately, the remaining songs are forgettable, including \\"When 2 R in Love\\" (a weak ballad lifted from the legendary \\"Black Album\\"). Whenever Prince decides to remaster \\"Lovesexy,\\" he should include the \\"Alphabet St.\\" instrumental remix as a bonus track.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|This version, which was released in 1982, is out of date, not as entertaining and not as appropriate for very young children as the 1999 version with Kathy Bates.  In this version, Carol Burnett is drunk and mean, the dangerous scenes are a little too scary for little girls, and the dancing makes me embarrassed to have lived through the 80's.  Still, it's a fun, classic movie and I wouldn't say it's bad.  I just think the Kathy Bates version is so much better and I would buy that one first.  Our three little girls love it!
B001DPC52C|5.0|Got the DVD, and have to say...what an awesome concert!!!  Enjoyed every second of thier performance and have to say, the only thing better would be if they release the Blu-Ray of this concert for sale in the US.  Watched it three times straight through in the first two days I had it.  Excellent choice for any WT fan!!
B001BKG9SK|4.0|On August 26, 2006 David Gilmour was invited to play a concert at the Gdansk Shipyards in celebration of the 20th Anniversary of Solidarity. Gilmour ended his On An Island Tour with this show which features the Baltic Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra conducted by Zbigniew Preisner.    The package features the entire concert on two CDs. The main focus of the concert was a full presentation of Gilmour's On an Island material with the Orchestra. Also featured is material from the Pink Floyd catalogue. The highlight of this material is a stunning live version of Echoes featuring the late Richard Wright in one of his last live appearances.    The third disc features a video of highlights from the concert. This disc leaves out a good deal of the Pink Floyd material but is still a great document of the show. It has a running time of about two hours. The disc also features a making of featurette called Gdansk Diary which also covers some background on the Solidarity movement in Poland.    More performances are included on a fourth disc. These performances include highlights from the Island tour recorded at the Mermaid Theatre in London, The AOL Sessions in New York and Live at Abbey Road. The performances are rounded out by three \\"Barn Jams\\" recorded at Gilmour's home in Sussex.. The fourth disc also includes a DTS mix of the album ON An Island.    Once again Gilmour has given the fan an affordable package with a great wealth of material. Highly recommended.
B000TGJ8CQ|1.0|This may be the worse big budget movie that I have ever seen. First, Nicolas Cage is laughable. He is a horrible actor. His choice of movies, mainly action hero films hides his incompetence as an actor. If he wasn't  Francis Ford Coppola's nephew, we may have been spared his one dimensional man acting. Second, the plot of this film is comic book material.  Phillip K Dick's books aren't all great material.    This movie is for the simple minded, one dimensional, testosterone idiots that made Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Diesel and Van Damme stars.    Heaven help us that this non-sensical crap is being consumed by our young  people. Dumb actors, big tits exposed and lousy scripts. Perhaps this explains how an idiot like Bush could become President of the United States. Our kids are becoming mindless consumers.    How did a decent actress like Julianne Moore end up in this film?  Where is her judgment?    I gave it one star. It deserves none!!!!!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay has done it again. Nothing is more relaxing than the soothing sounds of \\"Viva La Vida\\". Coldplay's musical hooks continue to dazzle, and Martin's voice is more full of spirit than ever, despite the album's main theme of death.        Many criticisms are based on this fact. Yet, the album is anything but depressing. It is uplifting, pleasant, and hearing each track for the first time was like discovering buried treasure.       The title track, \\"Viva La Vida,\\" is not only musically pleasant and extraordinary, but also philosophical. Many songs are of a sweet nature, and many a time, I've found myself curled up with a book or just relaxing to the ten tracks, which whiz by in what seems like seconds, even though the album lasts for over 40 minutes.       I urge all fans of music, whether you are into Coldplay or not, to check out this triumphant album. I'm glad I did.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|The Guv'nor does it again.     Beck has been consistently the most interesting and original guitar player in rock since his Yardbirds days, though sometimes held back by lacklustre material. Whereas many of his peers have been resting on their past glories, Beck has been on a constant and continuous development path, even reinventing the way he plays his guitar. He now stands in a category by himself, coaxing impossible sounds from his guitar that give a vocal quality to what he plays.    The tracks on the CD cover a lot of ground in Beck's career and a lot of musical ground: rock, blues, jazz, fusion, reggae etc.. all meld into a musical whole and are made his own. He is aptly supported by his amazing regular band, Vinne Colaiuta, Tal Wilkenfield and Jason Rebello.    Very highly recommended. You'll be hard pressed to find a more original musician anywhere.
B001ECE4DC|5.0|Although there are tiny, noticible clicks in some of the b-sides, this is a great collection.  The cover art is simple, and to the point.  The remasters sound really good. I couldn't hear the problems mentioned without the chart of so-called errors listed in the first review.  One thing to mention is that on the American release 586 does not drop any bass notes.    I love New Order.
031606792X|5.0|OH MY GOODNESS THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST ONE OUT OF THE ENTIRE TWILIGHT SAGA! There is some sex in it so I advised my 9 year old sister to wait a while until she reads it.  Some of the book in in Jacob's point of veiw, which was an intriguing change I thought.  It is full of suspense. Since it is the last book in the saga, anything could happen and I couldn't put this book down even if I wanted to.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Ok with all the reviews about this, I did some research about this on the web & this is what I got. I  went to 2 different websites to see what the deal is with the Columbia full screen vs wide screen versions that Columbia has on DVD. Region 1 is full screen and region 2 is wide screen.<br />One website does show the differences clearly - it is a full screen movie as were a lot of movies back then. the aspect is 1:37 - not 1.85. you can see clearly from the images shown that the widescreen version is BADLY CROPPED on the top and bottom. You are missing all kinds of details on the top and bottom. Or are you ? Or were those badly cropped scenes not really supposed to be seen in the film ? Are they not intended to be there ? Is the full frame transfer showing more than intended ?<br />I have personally viewed both and I am keeping both the full frame and widescreen versions. Each transfer has something more to show be it the top or bottom or left to right. I dont think you can go wrong no matter how you watch it. Whether or not you see more or less isnt quite as important as 'is the film good?' And the answer is YES, this is a GREAT courtroom drama and should be part of every classic movie fans' collection.<br />There are also many websites which explain the controversy over this. Basically you see the full picture in a full frame print, with more background details while the widescreen print shows it is cropped from the top & bottom. There is an argument that can be made that those background scenes mean nothing and have nothing to do with the image, but again the question is - Did Otto Preminger shoot it this way to show everything ? Or was it really shot in widescreen ? Only Otto knew for sure.<br />TCM plays a widescreen version - the same as the Region 2 Columbia.<br />This is a great movie - a supreme courtroom drama with James Stewart and George C Scott. I highly recommend this movie and if you want to get the DVD - any DVD would work. If you get the Region 1 DVD - it is arguably the original aspect and should ignore the modified at the beginning. Or get the Region 2 or just watch the TCM version and enjoy it in a widescreen transfer.<br />I know which websites do the comparisons and each reviewer has valid reasoning to how its show. The ultimate answer is just own the movie and enjoy it no matter how much picture you get :)ly the original aspect and should ignore the modified at the beginning. Or get the Region 2 or just watch the TCM version and enjoy it in a widescreen transfer.   I know which websites do the comparisons and each reviewer has valid reasoning to how its show. The ultimate answer is just own the movie and enjoy it no matter how much picture you get :)
015206396X|5.0|Graceling tells the story of a young woman who lives in a world where people are \\"graced.\\" Meaning they were born with a gift, some of flight, speed, mind reading, but Katsa was gifted with one that people fear...the grace of killing.<br />Here Uncle is King Randa and he controls one of seven kingdoms, he keeps his people under control using Katsa as a threat.

Together Po and Katsa try and solve the mystery of who planned to kidnap his grandfather, while figuring out each others own deep dark secrets.<br /><br />A five star book, I haven't been so excited to re-read a book in so long and this was well worth the re-reading.
B000YOP9BW|5.0|It's the same offering that walmart sells.<br />This recording has not been remastered and never has, maybe in the future a remastered version will happen. The Beatles White Album still stands today as a excellent piece of work.<br /><br />I recommend buying it but don't throw away good money at the same time. ;)
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This movie is just a good, wonderful, fantasy, and shouldn't be taken for anything more than that.  I saw a really bad movie at the theatre before this movie on the same day and it helped me not to go home with a bad taste in my mouth and eliminated any regret at going to the movies that day.
031606792X|4.0|I really liked the fact that Bella becomes a vampire and comes into her own as being independent and having her own mega power to harness. I'd rather read about a woman finding the strength to do what she has to, and do it intellectually, than a woman always making the wrong decisions and making a mess of things. I thought Bella's narrative in the the first book too whiney, and Meyers did a great job of depicting  the grief of a broken heart.  However Breaking Dawn was my favorite of the four.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|The story's predictable.  Two women, burned in their respective relationships, decide to change countries and homes for a holiday break.  Both fall in love with local gents.    Amanda (Diaz) is a California television producer who's got no spark with her live-in boyfriend.  She throws him out when she learns he was cheating on her and she still cannot cry.      Iris (Winslet) is an English editor who's been involved with Jasper (Rufus Sewell) who can't seem to let her go, but is going to marry someone else.        And yet, both acting and some twists in the plot made this a film I'll buy and watch again.  One of the particular treats is Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) appears in California as an aging writer who needs help from Iris to get some of his 'gumption' back.      The soundtrack is also lovely.  I particularly enjoyed some of the instrumental pieces.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2008
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is probably the best series ever.  The acting is excellent, the scenery realistic, and the action breathtaking.
B000NAAGD8|5.0|It took me a while to really start to like this album, but after about ten listens, I decided it was probably excellent, and I have now decided it is excellent. I liked Silent Alarm from the first time I heard it. Weekend in the City is not like that and you shouldn't expect it to grab you like Silent Alarm probably did.  If you have never listened to Bloc Party then you should buy Silent Alarm. If you have listened to Bloc Party and are willing to put a little effort into your music listening then you should try this album out.
1439102813|4.0|Lisa Genova's \\"Still Alice\\" is a gripping and moving read that takes you into the mind of a woman coming to grips with and suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  Alice Howland, a tenured professor at Harvard, is barely 50 and is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's very early in the novel.  \\"Still Alice\\" covers just over two years in Alice's life, moves quickly, and is an easy and often painful read.      Genova uses third person narrative to focus on Alice's emotional and nightmarish journey into the early phase of Alzheimer's.  A first-person narrative may have been more interesting, albeit difficult, but Genova gives plenty of insight into Alice's mental state and thoughts.  This novel is extremely moving and will certainly cause the reader to reflect upon and be more patient with those suffering from Alzheimer's.  This is a very good and worthy read, however, the author is entirely focused on Alice.  It would've been interesting to gain some insight as to what those who love Alice (her husband, children, co-workers) were going through/thinking although the reader can certainly infer plenty.  Unfortunately, Genova focuses entirely on the struggles within Alice and, for the most part, fails to delve into the reaction/response of those around Alice--at least, internally.  A minor complaint, but something that would've made this terrific book even better.    This is a great book certain to find a large following.  It will make the reader think and will also entertain as it moves from early diagnoses to fairly advanced dementia.  A thoughtful and entertaining novel and highly recommended.
B000FSME1A|5.0|The movie is a classic, and the box set is beautiful. A must own for fans...
B000002I2G|5.0|I went into this album not yet knowing all the criticism that it had garnered. My spontaneous reaction after listening to the whole thing was that I really enjoyed the sound of this particular Door's album.<br /><br />Coming into this album, I was only familiar with \\"Touch Me\\". In the end I also enjoyed \\"Tell All The People\\", \\"Wild Child\\", \\"Wishful Sinful\\", and \\"The Soft Parade\\".<br /><br />Remember, one of the Door's motto is to \\"Open the Doors of Perception\\". Maybe a shift in \\"perception\\" is needed by all the detractors in order to enjoy this unique experience.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I saw the 3D movie in the theater originally, it was a fun action packed movie with very good 3D. I picked it up on BluRay to check out 3D at home. It was very impressive. Some scenes were as good as the theater some were a little hard to focus on. I don't know if it's my TV, my seating position or the ambient light in the room, but all of the above effects the quality of the 3D at home. Regardless the movie looked great, and was very entertaining.
078322737X|5.0|Well, this past weekend, I sat down and watched [[ASIN:078322737X American Graffiti (Collector's Edition)]] yet one more time.<br /><br />Before Star Wars, before Indiana Jones, before Spielberg and Lucas were household names, we all got a chance to go back to that scary, emotional, momentous time between high school and college.  We're transported back to that short period of time, when we are all masters of our own universe... ready to take the world by the horns.  At the same time, we're unable to avoid the reality of our nervousness and of being unsure of ourselves.  In other words, we're transported back to discover our uniquely American humanity.<br /><br />That's the message of American Graffiti , and the reason for its success.<br /><br />We find all the normal ingredients of conflict between:<br />* good and evil<br />* beauty and plainness<br />* \\"coolness\\" and \\"not-so-cool\\"<br />* youth and older age (in this case the dividing line is determined by the number of years before or since high school graduation)<br />* leaving home or staying with the familiar<br />* fast cars and faster cars<br />* those successful with the opposite sex and those not so successful<br /><br />In the end, as the Beach Boys begin to sing and just before the credits begin to scroll down the screen, we're brought back to reality.  The main characters are eventually...<br /><br />* killed by a drunk driver<br />* missing in action in Vietnam<br />* selling insurance in California<br />* writing in Canada<br /><br />John Cathcart<br />Award-winning author of \\"Delta 7\\"
B000LXHK2C|4.0|For a 'romantic comedy,' i.e. - chick flick - this moves exceptionally well, thanks to director Ridley Scott, I suspect. Nice editing, good dialogue and a charming storyline. I had no idea that Russell Crowe aspires to be a rock star. See the extra music videos. Definitely watch.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I truely love this band. I am confused that they have not blown up, here in America. Hello, rock and roll you all. This Cd, like all their others, has few tracks you will skip. Pick this up and you will not be disappointed, unless you do not know what rocks.
1892005034|5.0|This book is an excellent educational tool to help all people learn to really listen to others so they feel acknowledged and so they themselves can in turn respond with confidence and respect.

B0017V7GTY|5.0|I have heard the future and I like it. I love these guys. This cd gets better the deeper in you get, not a throw away amoungst them. I rarely skip a track and that is rare. I am very new to them and hope to catch them live. Instant classic.
B000ECXWVI|3.0|Virtually every scene involving the enemy in this movie makes a ridiculous notion that Japanese soldiers would fight a guerilla style war by running over a ridge like characters in Duck Hunt. Cage's own combat demeanor in the movie is silly as well. The cunning that this style of engagement would require is hardly touched on.     The story of the Navajo codetalker should have been made much more personal by giving more back story about the two codetalkers. While I like Cage, he just doesn't have the grit of Clint Eastwood, which makes it difficult to believe in his Rambo-like persona. The story deserves better.
B001DVBZ4K|1.0|[[ASIN:B001DVBZ4K Horton Hears a Who! (Amazon.com Exclusive DVD Gift Set with Plush and Audio Storybook CD + Digital Copy)]]    This gift set did not include the audio storybook cd and is false advertising.

B0000009SY|2.0|REVIEW: Originally released as two separate albums (the single LP \\"ACT I\\" and the double album \\"ACTS II AND III\\"): Frank Zappa's epic concept album \\"JOE'S GARAGE\\" is a \\"special presentation\\" that depicts a dismal future America whereby music has been outlawed and musicians are incarcerated for breaking that law. Coming from someone who created the chilling, \\"SGT. PEPPER\\" kiss-off \\"WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY\\": this promises to be a landmark of experimental rock/satire. Instead we get a long-winded mock-opera that starts off with a great Zappa parody/homage (the title track), but then quickly degenerates into the usual scatalogical/pornographic smut that Frankie peddles ad nauseam. As such the album(s) have aged very, very badly. And i'm not just harping on the lyrical short-comings: the music is just as hit-and-miss. From the lame faux-funk of \\"Dong Work For Yuda\\" to the musical re-casting of \\"Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up\\" as \\"Sy Borg\\": \\"JOE'S GARAGE\\" can be impossibly dull. If it weren't for Zappa's detailed production, and a few choice bits like the ominous \\"Crew Slut\\", the alienation anthem \\"Outside Now\\", the roasting of L. Ron Hubbard on \\"A Token Of My Extreme\\", the beautiful guitar showcase \\"Watermelon In Easter Hay\\", and the goofy coda \\"A Little Green Rosetta\\" then the album would be a total waste of time. Zappa has done better work than this.    HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION:    \\"ACT I\\" (Number 27)  \\"ACT II AND III\\" (Number 53)    HIT SINGLES: nonean who just turned thirty-six: I can't help shaking my head and saying to myself \\"what a load of peverted b.s.\\" Zappa works better when he zeroes in on specific targets to parody (i.e. hippie America, Jim and Tammy Bakker, Jesse Jackson, etc.) rather than going on and on about deviant sexual behaviors that serve only to mark him as the \\"Jerry Springer\\" of rock and roll. Zappa is smarter than this. For goodness sakes: he was the most innovative, ahead-of-his-time composer of the 20th century! I don't understand why he would waste his talent and his energy on such absolute rubbish. Of course he had a sense of humor: but humor does require SOME sense. I suppose you could say that he took a line of his own lyric (courtesy of \\"A Token Of My Extreme\\") to heart: \\"it's just a lot of nothing/so what can it mean?\\" I guess absolutely nothing, Frank. But because of the graphic sexual depictions, harsh language, and the offensive \\"Catholic Girls\\" (to cite the most obnoxious of Zappa's XXX set-pieces): the content (at best) deserves a very strong OBJECTIONABLE rating. Christians (and other people of faith) would probably be just as happy to give it a DISPOSABLE rating (regardless of the fact that there are some decent moments of musical satire that crop up every now and then). If you are a Zappa fan then you know what you are getting into. If you're not a Zappa fan (or are easily offended) then I would suggest you pass this up in favor of the twin compilations \\"STRICTLY COMMERCIAL\\" and (especially) \\"STRICTLY GENTEEL: A CLASSICAL INTRODUCTION TO FRANK ZAPPA\\". Both of which will give you a pretty good idea of Zappa's musical range as well as a sampling of his irreverent sense of humor. From there I would recommend the (mostly) instrumental \\"HOT RATS\\", \\"GRAND WAZOO\\", the Grammy award winning \\"JAZZ FROM HELL\\", the brilliant \\"WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY\\", \\"UNCLE MEAT\\", or \\"FREAK OUT!\\". Or if you're really adventurous get the triple disc \\"LATHER\\" box set as it does (in spite of histrademark scatalogical material) represent Zappa at his far-reaching best. After that you're on your own.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION:     \\"ACT I\\" (Number 27)  \\"ACT II AND III\\" (Number 53)    HIT SINGLES: none
0385491026|5.0|A lot of people point to Margaret Atwood's science fiction as her best work but I completely disagree. I am not a big fan of either Oryx and Crake or The Handmaid's Tale. However, this book, I think, is just about a must-read for anybody who wants to truly understand the feminist perspective. It's also a fantastic example of how a good narrative can drive a point home much, much better than an essay. The essay beats you over the head with its points whereas the narrative presents you with a compelling story and the thematic material gets in by the side.<br /><br />It is a pro-feminist book but one of the reasons that I enjoyed it is that it's not a \\"OMG MEN SUX\\" type pro-feminist book. The meanest people in here are all women. The most interesting characters are women. In many cases, the men seem to be just along for the ride. I would whine about Atwood's lack of ability to depict realistic male characters, but she's not half as bad at this as John Irving is at depicting realistic women, so she gets a pass on this for me. But the women in this story just make a great deal of sense. I'm not sure I completely buy the argument that men can't really write about women and vice versa, but if I wanted to make an argument for that, this book would be one of the first on my list.<br /><br />If your experience with Atwood is Handmaid's Tale and you get the idea that she's like a feminist version of Ayn Rand, this is one of the books that will change your mind.
B000E8QVWY|1.0|It's sad to watch memories of the real deal fade in to a middle-finger t-shirt, Walk the Line dvd, \\"I love Cocaine Blues\\", punk/rockabilly anti-hero oblivion in these 'modern' times.  If anyone ever reads this and doesn't understand that statement or becomes offended by it...  well???  There is memory a friend of mine shared with me of Johnny and June playing back in either the late 80's or early 90's.  They both stayed(unexpectedly) over 2 1/2 hrs after their show ended to meet and listen to each and every person that wanted to speak with them.  The show was held at small Otoe bingo hall here in Oklahoma.  My friend's memory of their conversation, the feeling that Johnny and June left him and ,of course, June's kiss on his cheek were held in high regard amongst his many reflections.  Moments like those and the true spirit of the 2 folks that brought them to millions of people on this earth are not documented at all in this motion picture.  A waste.
0307269752|5.0|I spotted this book on sale at the book store and decided to try it. Having read a review about it, I had relatively high hopes. I was NOT disappointed. I can't wait for the next book of the trilogy to come out. In the mean time, I have a renewed interest in other Northern European crime authors. I have started reading Henning Mankell, read all of Håkan Nesser's English translations, books by Peter Høeg, Arnaldur Indridason, Asa Larsson, and Karin Fossum. Of these authors, I think Høeg comes the closest to the literary quality of Larssen, and in all actuality probably surpasses him. But having said that, I am truly looking forward to the release of Larssen's next two books in English. It is such a shame that he passed and that continued books will not be possible from him.
B0009X766Y|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"You're right...[The con game] is not enough.  But it's close!\\"<br /><br />The above is what one of the con artists (or CONfidence game artists) says at the end of this fantastically entertaining movie.<br /><br />This is a caper film set in late 1936.  It revolves around a complicated but interesting plot by two professional con artists (played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford) to swindle a mob boss (played by Robert Shaw).  The actual genesis of the idea behind this movie's plot is really unknown but rumour has it that it was inspired by some real-life con games.<br /><br />The expression \\"the sting\\" refers to the moment a con artist finishes the \\"play\\" (the mechanics of the con game) and takes the \\"mark's\\" (the one being swindled or conned) money.  (Today this expression is mainly used in the context of a law enforcement sting operation.)<br /><br />If the con game is successful, the mark does not realize he or she has been \\"taken\\" (cheated), at least not until the con artists are long gone.<br /><br />This movie goes out of its way to make you feel like you're watching a 1930's film.  Here are four reasons why:<br /><br />(1) During the opening credits, the viewer is shown the main actors (there are eleven) with extracts from the actual movie.  This is a style reminiscent of films from the early to mid 1930s.<br /><br />(2) This movie is divided into distinct sections or parts with old fashioned title cards that has lettering and illustrations.<br /><br />(3) The costumes that the actors wear.  All are 1930's style.<br /><br />(4) This movie's musical score especially its main theme melody \\"The Entertainer\\", a piano ragtime composition by American composer Scott Joplin (1867 to 1917).  This music in turn encouraged a surge of popularity and critical acclaim (and deservedly so!!) for Joplin's music.  (Ragtime is an originally American genre which had its peak popularity between 1897 and 1918.

031606792X|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this series of books:  Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. I checked out Twilight at the library. I had never heard of it before, but I quickly loved the tale. I just had to read more, so I asked about getting on the waiting list at the library.<br /><br />The books are so popular that the libraries' waiting list was longer than long. I thought that a possible four month wait was too long, so I bought the remaining three books.<br /><br />So, now I am done after reading all four books. The library started this voyage into the lives of vampires and werewolfs.<br /><br />This book, Breaking Dawn, begins as the other books did, from Bella's viewpoint. I began to lose interest in the book when the viewpoint changed from Bella to Jacob. Jacob and the werewolves acted like toddlers, and I felt like Meyer's writing style had gone down-hill.<br /><br />When the viewpoint returned to Bella, Meyer's writing style absolutely soared. It was well worth the wait through the viepoint of Jacob. The return to Bella's perspective was great. Meyer's ended on a high note.
B00001OH7O|4.0|REVIEW: What a weird freakin' album! On \\"HUNKY DORY\\" Bowie combines the Anthony Newley-induced music hall of his first British LP with the sonic whoomp! of \\"THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD\\" and the more singer/songwriter conventions of \\"SPACE ODDITY\\" in order to come up with a really unusual conglomoration of a record. And so the dude jumps from cutsey-pie outings like a cover of Biff Rose/Paul Williams' \\"Fill Your Heart\\" (cheesy cabaret mangled by Bowie's over-the-top singing) and \\"Kooks\\" (written for his son Zowie) to the eerie, acoustic guitar apocalypse of \\"Quicksand\\" (with its name dropping references to occultist/black magician Aleister Crowley, Nazi Himmler, Greta Garbo, etc.; and pessimistic attitude toward religion - \\"Can't take my eyes from the great salvation/of bulls**t faith.\\" - and life in general) which was either an inspired slice of mayhem or pure lyrical drivel. \\"Changes\\" became a belated pop hit, and an anthem for many an alientaed adolescent in the early seventies. \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" only hints at the decadent, (bi)sexually-charged Ziggy Stardust character that Bowie would be forever linked to. But the record's best moments comes via a series of artistic portraits/tributes/homages that he fashions on side two (on CD: tracks 8, 9, and 10): the odd-sounding yet brilliant \\"Andy Warhol\\", the Lou Reed/Velvet Underground-inspired rocker \\"Queen Bitch\\", and the melodic \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" which are absolutely stunning. Yet it is the somber, doomsday-ridden closer \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\" (with its haunting melody and drunken English climax) that provides a surefire testament to Bowie's genius even though it seems a mile removed from the striking pop of \\"Life On Mars?\\" and the slight (yet pretty) poesy of \\"Eight Line Poem\\". Definately a curiosity.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 93.    HIT SINGLE: \\"Changes\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 41).

B000002J1S|5.0|Needless to say this is Peter Gabriels final album with Genesis and it was his ultimate concept album with them-two albums and two CD's in fact.Well the least you can say at least they made good use of the space of the orginal vinyl format by filling each album to capacity (in it's time anyway) and it's perfect for this type of thing anyway.The music and lyrics here great such an absurdly huge amount of imagry (everything from lyrics about the KKK serving soul food to some type of gastric sounding mouth organ) that it's hard to take it all in one sitting.Musically this album takes Genesis's wide tapestry of sound to even further extent then [[ASIN:B000002J1O Selling England by the Pound]] by incorperating an even stronger use of synthesizers and \\"The Waiting Room\\" with it's heavily percussive electronic intro. At various points the music is features longer compositions while many are short \\"sound bridges\\" or intros that serve only to segue into real songs. Many of the songs sound great on their own-the first version of the title song for example,\\"Back In N.Y.C\\" and the poignant \\"Broadway Melody Of 1974\\". This is one of those albums you can just tell was meant to be listened to again and again-that in such a case you can get all sorts of different things from it.So in time I will likely add more to this review but it is a seriously good album if your willing to put the time in for so much music.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Released in 2007 and based on Neil Gaiman's 1998 novel, Stardust is an unexpected gem among recent SF and fantasy films, a fairytale with some interesting and modern twists delivered by a cast on fine form.<br /><br />The movie opens with young Englishman Dunstan Thorn crossing the forbidden wall near his village to investigate the magical kingdom that is said to lie beyond. There he has an amorous encounter with a young woman claiming to be a captive princess. Nine months later, after Dunstan's return home, a baby is deposited outside his house. Dunstan raises Tristan (Charlie Cox) to become a fine and adventurous young man, who becomes besotted with the most beautiful girl in the village, Victoria (Sienna Miller). After they see a shooting star fall beyond the wall one night, Tristan vows to find the fallen star and give it as a gift to Victoria to prove his worthiness.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Tristan, the shooting star is the result of a scheme by the late King of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole), who has hurled his amulet from his bedchamber and decreed that whoever of his surviving sons who finds the amulet will be worthy to succeed him. The amulet's return to Earth has knocked a star named Yvaine (Claire Danes) out of the sky, forcing her to take human form. Tristan swiftly locates her and decides to fulfil his promise to Victoria, but their return to the wall is strewn with obstacles, not least in the form of the witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wishes to find the star and consume it to restore youth and long life to herself and her sisters. The King's squabbling sons are also searching for the star as well. The result is a road movie taking in an airship commanded by a fearsome pirate (Robert De Niro) who harbours a secret, a magically-created inn, a unicorn and lots more as well.<br /><br />Stardust is a tremendously good movie. The number of fantasy films (excluding Lord of the Rings) that have really worked in the last few years is pretty low, and you arguably have to go back to The Princess Bride to find the last undisputed classic in the genre (although no doubt some would speak up in favour of The Dark Crystal or Labyrinth). Stardust works because it has excellent pacing, fantastic acting, great dialogue and a strong script which shoots down inconsistencies and plot holes whenever they show up. Charlie Cox and especially Claire Danes make for appealing protagonists and De Niro gives his all in a gift of a role with the self-contradictory Captain Shakespeare. Pfeiffer's excellent turn makes you ponder why she doesn't seem to crop up very often in movies any more. Ricky Gervais is less successful in a minor cameo, but luckily (despite his appearance on the DVD cover) he is in the movie for barely two minutes, so that isn't an issue. The story takes some highly unexpected twists and turns before an impressive showdown is reached, and the ending, whilst a happy one, isn't exactly saccharine (the body count needed to get there is quite high).<br /><br />It's difficult to think of any negatives with this movie. It's light, breezy, fresh and fun but not shallow. A great story with intelligent characters it is laugh-out-loud funny in many places, but with some real moments of pathos and emotional intensity elsewhere. Fantasy movies as good as this don't come along very often these days, so check it out.<br /><br />Stardust (*****) is available now in DVD in the UK and USA.o The Princess Bride to find the last undisputed classic in the genre (although no doubt some would speak up in favour of The Dark Crystal or Labyrinth).

1905236042|4.0|I know these are meant for children (or for parents to use with younger children), but this adult beginner yogi intends to make good use of them for herself.  I bought both the Yoga Pretzels card deck and Rodney Yee's Yoga Poetry of the Body card deck. Of the two sets, I much prefer Yoga Pretzels.  The Yoga Pretzel cards are colorful and joyful to look at and make me feel happy.  Directions for the various positions and breath are easy to understand and the questions, quotes and sayings on the cards are appealing and thought provoking without being pretentious or flowery.  They just make sense to me.  I agree with the other posters who mention that it is too bad that some of the poses have been given new names instead of using generally accepted names and that is why I am giving four stars instead of five.  All in all though, I think these cards are absolutely fabulous!    Edited to add:  I ended up giving these to my sister for her 3 year old granddaughter.  My sister says she seems to enjoy them, studying the pose on the card very carefully and then trying to mimic it, but that the best part is listening to her descriptions as she talks herself through the moves, as she is quite entertaining!

0060558121|5.0|You need to appreciate a bit of ambiguity in your fiction to really enjoy this book. Aspects are slowly revealed. Some of the side stories tie in directly but others only add flavor. Even the key moments are not delivered in a dramatic fashion. So there's a bit of a dream-like feel to it, but that's appropriate to the storyline. Everything is not wrapped up tidily at the end, although there is a closure. A bit like life.<br /><br />I loved the basic concepts of gods being defined by our belief in them and our sacrifices to them and what happens, what could happen, when belief changes or shifts to other things. It was easy to become invested in the main character and his journey was well worth reading about.

B001ACG5Z6|5.0|If you have stumbled through life,giving punctuation your best shot;you'll get a kick out of this little tome.It can ,in no way,be considered a textbook on punctuation. It'll ,in no way,make you an expert;but it will show you what a mess this whole business of punctuation is;and why and how it has become such a mess...and you'll see why it is unlikely to improve in the forseeable future.<br /> You may have noticed another edition of this book with about 40 Reviews.That edition,somewhat earlier,seemed to be only about the comma,from the look and content of those reviews.This newer edition,covers all the punctuation marks;and even several that I didn't know even existed.<br /> It seems that punctuation marks hadn't become widesptead 'til the 16th and 17th Century;and many even later. They seem to have been more in the realm of the printers,publishers,nitpickers and editors than the writers. As a matter of fact,writers of no less stature than George Bernard Shaw,held this whole subject in mild contempt.<br />  The book is a good read,but you will soon come to the conclusion that there is a lot of disagreement amongst the experts (self appointed).<br /> Language is continually changing and those changes are no less profound than with punctuation.<br />  Even if you become an \\"expert\\" you still have a problem.Typewriters and now compuer keyboards are limited.

B000002513|5.0|Bruce Springsteen was pretty good in the early 70's.  I'm not a fan by any means, and he's truly not on my list of personal top 100 favorite artists, but his first two albums are pretty freakin' sweet.  I'm sorry for bringing this up again, but he really does remind me of Elvis Presley on several occasions with the voice shaking thing he does.  I honestly don't think Bruce can HELP it, it's just something that happens naturally whenever he sings emotionally.  It's pretty noticeable on this album.      Anyway, \\"The E. Street Shuffle\\" is a funky little track (one that's a bit hard to get into, in fact, because it's quite obnoxious the first time you hear it thanks to some sloppy songwriting habits of Bruce).  He corrected that problem years later, gradually.      \\"Rosalita\\" has AWESOME vocals, and if it wasn't for the spooky late-night smokey vibes of \\"Kitty's Back\\", it would surely be my favorite song.  Do NOT be fooled into thinking \\"New York Serenade\\" is a tedious overlong softly-spoken number that barely has a melody.  True, it FEELS that way the first couple times, but keep hearing it to find out how good it really is.  It DOES get better.     Overall, good album, and probably better than Born to Run.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|There clearly are some scenes that have been cutout of the original theatrical release. For those who didn't get to see the theatrical version, it might not make a difference.

B001KVZ6C0|5.0|Warning! Minor spoilers can be found in this review!<br /><br />Although I've seen some really good movies this year, I can say with confidence that SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the one that I've enjoyed most. It has already generated perhaps the best critical reviews of any film released in 2008 and has won audience awards at notable film festivals. The film completely lives up to the hype that has surrounded it.<br /><br />In the first couple of minutes of the film we learn several things. First, Jamal, a Muslim who is a product of the slums, is a participant on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? Second, he is suspected of cheating and is subjected to horrific torture at the hands of the police. Gradually, after having failed to elicit confessions of how he had cheated, Jamal related, while they all watch a video of his television appearance, how he knew the answers of each of the questions. The result is a series of flashbacks that essentially tell the story of Jamal's life and his relations with the two most important relationships in his life, that of his street smart but sometimes amoral brother Salim, and Latika. These scenes are set in some of the most horrific squalor that one can imagine. It may seem unrealistic that someone could come out of such wretched life experiences as relatively unscarred as Jamal appears to be, but that is in part because at heart the film is a fairy tale. It is not an expose of the abuses of modern economic life. At heart it is a love story.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of director Danny Boyle, not having enjoyed at all 28 DAYS or TRAINSPOTTING or his other efforts, but his work here is nothing short of miraculous. I knew none of the cast, though I've read that several members are well known Bollywood actors. This film, I have to hasten to add, has nothing in common with a Bollywood film apart from some of the actors. Though filmed in India, this is every bit a Western film. There are many marvelous performances, not least Dev Patel as Jamal. There are a number of child actors who turn in remarkable performances. And as the grown up Latika, the newcomer Freida Pinto is fascinating to look at with her almost surreal beauty.<br /><br />As I said, despite the squalid settings for much of the film, this is a fairy tale, a love story. But even knowing that the film ends as a fairy tale does not prepare one for the particulars. There were a number of ways that it might have ended and while the ending wasn't completely unexpected, it wasn't entirely predictable. In the end, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film, equal parts love story and comedy, set against the backdrop of almost inconceivable squalor. There has been talk of this Indie film perhaps pulling a LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and receiving some Oscar attention. We can only hope.amal.

055358894X|4.0|\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is an amazing, artful, and ambitious piece of work, but it does have a first-novel feel to it. Maybe when you get to the 720th page you'll feel that there are some scenes that could have been eliminated, some scenes that could have gone more smoothly, and some descriptive passages that could have been shortened.<br /><br />But here's what you'll find: Scott Lynch has tried for the picaresque fantasy, and has created for his setting the city of Comorra, which is meant to resemble Venice, although clearly the book is not set on planet earth. This world has multiple moons, ruins of a previous civilization, and sorcery is practiced.<br /><br />It has literary pretensions (it's published by Bantam Spectra, which specializes in that sort of thing), and while it is certainly well-written, Lynch (fortunately) lacks the \\"look at me! I'm writing!\\" pretentiousness of some of his contemporaries in this field. His grifter-hero, Locke Lamora, is a fascinating rogue, and the plot takes delightful twists and turns. It's not always a fun read, though: some of the scenes, for example when Locke tricks a money-lender out of his fashionable outfit, are amusing, but there are scenes of graphic violence, too.<br /><br />Mr. Lynch has come up with an interesting, but occasionally frustrating, way to tell the tale. He provides \\"interludes,\\" which flash back to Locke's days as an apprentice to a supposedly blind priest, and he means them to throw some light, and some hints, on the action that is taking place in the book's \\"present.\\" While they do provide information as to why Locke and his fellow \\"gentlemen bastards\\" behave as they do, they tend to appear while Locke is hanging from a literary cliff--and some of them don't supply enough information to make the diversion worthwhile, and a few of them seem tossed in simply because, well . . .<br /><br />Notes and asides: First of at least three, but complete in itself. Not for children under 13.

This 40th anniversary edition also provides two versions of \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and a partial rendering of \\"Indian Summer\\", both contemporaneous recordings which did not make the original.     \\"The Doors\\" sweeps straight into \\"classic\\" status (and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) on the basis of the opening track, the smash and grab, \\"Break on Through,\\" the pinnacled mid-point ridge, \\"Light my Fire\\" and \\"The End\\", like Scott in the Antarctic, an inspiring and ultimately devastating exploration.

What makes this set all the more inspiring is that it was recorded in just a few days, using minimal equipment, sometimes with the first take making it onto the record.  Of course in 1966, this was the way that things were done.  A band would not \\"make a record\\", a construction that occurred only in the studio, they would go into the studio to record what they did, with slightly better sound quality than the live rendering - and, in the case of Jim Morrison, the cleaning up of some of the lyrics.

Interestingly, the Doors did not have a regular bass player, Manzarek added many bass lines from his keyboard or organ pedals and he adds some \\"real\\" bass to this recording along with Larry Knetchel who plays on \\"Soul Kitchen,\\" \\"Twentieth Century Fox,\\" \\"Back Door Man,\\" \\"I Looked At You\\" and \\"Take It As It Comes.\\"    From the opening up-tempo off-beat drum beat and keyboard bass line to the abrupt end, \\"Break on Through\\" picks you up and shakes you all about - \\"...try to run, try to hide, break on through to the other side!\\"   This two and one half minute rocker makes anyones top ten list of \\"debut album, side 1, track 1\\" (see the book or movie, \\"High Fidelity\\" if you missed that cultural reference).      \\"Soul Kitchen\\", \\"Crystal Ship\\" and \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" give the recording the feel of a theatrical piece.  The prominence of the keyboard, Morrisons storytelling delivery, clipped percussion and the post surf - pre heavy metal wail of Manzareks guitar give the impression of a pit band or hipster club session.  The inclusion of the Berthold Brecht/Kurt Weill song \\"Whisky Bar (Alabama Song)\\" only adds to the drama.      One half expects a Jaques Brel tune to follow but a sharp drum beat spins the listener off into \\"Light my Fire\\".  Being a child IN the sixties I first experienced \\"Light My Fire\\" via Jose Feliciano and numerous other covers of less repute.  My first personal Doors experience would be [[ASIN:B0000264WB L.A. Woman]] when I was old enough to find my own music.  For those who have experienced the loungeinized \\"Light My Fire\\", this full seven minute original version is a revelation.  You need to hear Morrison yell \\"... come on baby light my FIYERRRR!\\" to truly get what this song is about.      The majesty of \\"Light My Fire\\" is that it is a simple tune, basically a jingly introduction, a repeated riff and a three chord refrain (or thereabouts), which through repetition and adding and removing layers of instrumentation, becomes a complex, almost symphonic work, in the twentieth century style.  In the mid-sixties, the extended rock/pop track was still a novelty and the blues based rock bands of Britain and the US were just beginning to experiment with the concept.  \\"Light My Fire\\" is a perfect platform for the extended solo over the verse/riff, in the style of the jazz greats (Coltranes [[ASIN:B000002I53 My Favorite Things]] etc.) who had led the way during the preceding decade.  Manzarek gives us variations on a theme through three minutes and ten seconds, at which point, if you haven't done so already, crank up your machine to full volume for Jim Kreigers guitar solo before the whole band come crashing back together for a final verse chorus.  Gold standard.    In the second half of \\"The Doors\\" their west coast sound comes more to the fore.  \\"End of the Night\\", \\"I Looked at You\\" and \\"Take it as it Comes\\" hint at the darkness of The End (sic.) to come, along with the addled optimism of the age.   \\"Back Door Man\\" a reworking of the Willie Dixon classic, pays homage to the blues roots of their sound and gives Morrison another opportunity to express his unambiguous lusts.    \\"The End\\" is the most overtly theatrical piece, based loosely on the greek tragedy Oedipus Rex with contemporary allusions to drug culture, the developing war in Vietnam and the draft.  The piece is largely free form and dreamy, in a psychedelic manner, with Indian raga like guitar lines, a classical organ sound held together by tabla percussion and drum fills from Densmore.  The vocal meanders and builds to the disturbing crescendo; \\"Father.  Yes son?  I want to kill you.   Mother, I want to... \\"  According to Ray Manzarek, Morrison \\"...wasn't saying he wanted to do that to his own Mom and Dad. He was re-enacting a bit of Greek drama. It was theatre!\\"      Theatre?  Bravo!  A tour de force!      Listeners to this version of \\"The End\\" should note that this runs close to 12 minutes - not a shortened version, as appears in \\"Appocalypse Now\\" for example.  Other live and unedited versions are also available, giving a clearer idea of Mr. Morrisons intentions towards his mother.      I was able to scare my parents with [[ASIN:B000002G7C The Velvet Underground & Nico]] records.  But the Velvets didn't scare me because I had already listened to \\"The End\\"
1406711284|5.0|Somehow, despite majoring in French literature and getting a Ph.D. in French history, I missed this one until I decided to read it recently.  Now I'm about to have a full-fledged Camus obsession because I've never met anyone who so well captures the absurdity of existence and the powerlessness of all of us before the inevitability of death.  Also, it is such a fun read.  It's unsettling, but also entertaining and the protagonist is extremely likable.  I love Camus!
B001232NG8|5.0|Notwithstanding what audiotechnophiles may say, \\"The Doors\\" classic self titled debut album loses nothing from the transfer to digital media and the listener can now experience the opus without interruption.  This 40th anniversary edition also provides two versions of \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and a partial rendering of \\"Indian Summer\\", both contemporaneous recordings which did not make the original.     \\"The Doors\\" sweeps straight into \\"classic\\" status (and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) on the basis of the opening track, the smash and grab, \\"Break on Through\\", the pinnacled mid-point ridge, \\"Light my Fire\\" and \\"The End\\", like Scott in the Antarctic, an inspiring and ultimately devastating exploration.      New listeners should avoid the \\"greatest hits\\" urge and listen to \\"The Doors\\" from start to finish.  Explore the intervening tracks which take the listener off in interesting asides and diversions that ultimately put the three \\"hits\\" in relief.  Your journey will be rewarded and you will find your own favorites.    What makes this set all the more inspiring is that it was recorded in just a few days, using minimal equipment, sometimes with the first take making it onto the record.  Of course in 1966, this was the way that things were done.  A band would not \\"make a record\\", a construction that occurred only in the studio, they would go into the studio to record what they did, with slightly better sound quality than the live rendering - and, in the case of Jim Morrison, the cleaning up of some of his lyrics.

B00000637V|4.0|Berlin is too powerful to recommend without some warnings.  It's an outstanding and astounding work, and it's great that CDs can be bought at a decent price, but I'll stick with my LP -- I have to be in a certain mood to go over and grab Berlin.  It's great that Amazon has snippets you can listen to online...do so.    Highlights: \\"Caroline Says II\\" \\"The Kids\\" and \\"Sad Song\\" are phenomenal if you can handle the sadness.  A younger brother of mine mentioned Berlin to me a few years back, recommending it, and I replied yes, I've had it for twenty years but wouldn't ever mention it because of its emotional depth.  He totally agreed and we left it there.  Most of the other songs are OK, but not great.  \\"Caroline Says I\\" is an odd attempt at an upbeat tone.  You could argue, artistically, that it sets up a background for the superior \\"Caroline Says II\\" but I don't think it works.  Along with Growing Up in Public (note: an extremely different sound and approach to personal music), Berlin is probably a work that no one will ever be able to remotely duplicate.  A wiseacre may say that no one will ever try, but I actually hear a lot of attempts in \\"meaningful\\" songs by supposedly cutting-edge and soulful artists.  You can't just simply write a few lyrics about betrayal, child neglect, loss...you have to communicate it (that's what artistry is about) and Lou Reed did it.  People will place Lou in the pantheon of rock greats for his hazy, glossy writing/singing with VU or the transexual schtick.  That's fine, and if that's what you're looking to hear, move on.  Berlin is a hammer straight to your chest and you better be ready for some heart pounding.
0375703764|5.0|Rather than overlapping some of the extensive summaries already posted, I'll zoom out and try to offer a helpful observation for the benefit of some of my fellow literati out there ... one that might help you decide to buy this book if you're still undecided.  This isn't really a spoiler per se, but for those who dislike even borderline spoilers, stop reading this review now.<br /><br />----------- OBSERVATION {borderline spoiler alert} -----------------<br /><br />As best I can tell, the title \\"House of Leaves\\" is something of a multi-layered metaphorical pun.  The first pun is that in older English, the pages of a book used to be called \\"leaves\\", so in effect, a book is a house built of leaves, or sheafs, of paper.  The second metaphorical pun concerns the house whose story the book relates.  One way to look at the Navidson house is as a metaphorical embodiment of Yggdrasil (feel free to Wikki that) - the dimension spanning World Ash Tree of Norse Mythology ... another \\"house of leaves\\" if you will.  Yggdrasil's branches spanned and connected all the known realms and dimensions, and it's roots extended down into depths of hell (where foul demonic creatures, including the corpse-eating niddhogg dragon, gnawed eternally on it's roots) and also into the magical pools of the Norns, and into the well of mimir (into which Wotan cast one of his eyes in order to gain vision into the hidden mysteries of the universe and the future).  It was upon a branch of yggdrasil that Odin carved his Spear of Law, Gungir, upon which all the treaties that held the known realms together were carved.<br /><br />So ... as with yggdrasil and gungir, this \\"house of leaves\\" tale interweaves the lives and perspectives and recorded accounts of everyone it touches, and travelling the tree takes (re: the staircase and closet expeditions) takes one on a long twisting nightmare expedition into unplumbed depths into otherworldly dimensions beyond the ken of mortal sanity.<br /><br />Feeling a little confused and intimidated ?  Good.  That's what the author intended. ;-)<br /><br />-----------{end of quasi spoiler} -----------------<br /><br />Anyway, the book has become a post-modernist classic of high-brow surreal horror, and has gathered something of a cult following.  I enjoyed it immensely. It's a great escapist mindbender, replete with overlapping changes of perspective, codes and obscure literary references.  Highly recommended ... especially for those like me who are devout readers with wide-ranging tastes.ood.

031606792X|4.0|This is the BEST series of books I have ever read.    I think too many people are reading WAY too much into the fourth and final book in the Twilight Series. Don't forget that the series is about a fanstical world. Sure there a few parts that make the book less than perfect, but its really an amazing final installment. It wraps up all the loose ends and puts Edward with Bella FOREVER! Isnt that all that really matters? They get their happy ending =)

B000002U9Y|4.0|This review is in stark contrast with the way many are reviewing the album. Unlike the vast majority, I did not first hear and become familiar with Dark Side or any of the later Pink Floyd material before approaching this album. Neither did I become a fan of the later or more popular material and then judge this album according to how well it held up to my like of that later material. And I could have cared less before buying this CD about the band's dealing with Syd and what his parting meant in terms of the group's dynamic in pushing forward with the next album.    I heard about the band from a friend who thought it would appeal to my musical tastes, which included an almost obsessive love of dark ambient of the likes of Cold Meat Industry bands, Coil, Lustmord, etc, and atmospheric music, as well as a love for the British invasion bands and pop/psychedelic rock of `60s--particularly The Zombie's Odessey and Oracle, the Beatle's Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine--along with Pet Sounds, Smile, some Bee Gees, Yardbirds, etc, and an interest in old folk tunes and experimental music in general. So my friend suggested Piper at the Gates of Dawn. After hearing clips for Piper here on Amazon, I purchased that CD and became very familiar with that as my only real experience with the music of Pink Floyd.    Having fallen in love with Piper, I knew I had to hear more from PF. I purchased Saucerful of Secrets and have given it a very long run. Overall, I am deeply impressed. Let There Be Light is absolutely amazing both in terms of its pop sensibility and its art. Remember A Day is just a beautiful and great song to listen to. Set the Controls, which seems to be everyone's rave song, I found to be somewhat banal and uninteresting. I do not think the artistry or impact of the song is in any way significant or influential. I wish the vocals were not so repressed and I wish the music did something...somewhere... It is slowly wearing on me, but it will never be a track that I can turn to as any kind of strength or interest for the band. Corporal Clegg is a great song in the vein of the Brit invasion pop/psychedelic `60s stuff I love. The influence from and appeal to Sgt. Pepper is obvious and very welcome. The title track Saucerful is absolutely incredible--a masterpiece of ambient and psychedelic with a hint of darkness to it and a celestial ending. This track alone makes the CD a worthwhile purchase for someone like myself. It truly makes up for the low point. Speaking of which, See-saw was the only real flop. It goes nowhere and is only interesting insofar as it breaks down into a completely different sound at certain points. The ending by Syd, Jugband Blues, is incredible. It was great to see the same style and creative talent that was the main motivation in Piper round off and conclude the CD. All the reviews that seem try to find psychological meaning in the lyrics or makeup of the song are really missing the entire point--Syd was a Surrealist and the song is surrealism. The meaning is not in the lyrics or in the structure of the song, but in the destruction and absurdity of lyrical meaning and song structure. It is obvious that the rest of the band isn't (at least quite yet) making Surrealism music, but they still do an amazing job playing with the sound and creating very interesting and intelligent music. I am eager to check out Ummagumma and Atom Heart Mother to see how they progress.    Perhaps the one thing I really wanted to know, which was very difficult to sift out from the reviews on Amazon, was what the sound quality was like, whether it was mono or stereo, and if there were other versions that would sound better and how and why the sound was better.  Fortunately, I had a friend who had done a lot of research before me and told me about the virtually non-distorted and crystal clear quality of the sound from the CDs on the Shine On box set. Now having listened to the CD from that box set, I am thankful at least someone knew what information was important to have and I pass that valuable info on to you: unless you're willing to lay out giant sums of money for the \\"gold disc\\" or MFSL versions, get this CD from the Shine On box set version because the sound quality is absolutely incredible and this music deserves to be heard this good.
0792843584|3.0|I was really not impressed with this western.  It was too long and drawn out. I thought it would never get over with. The action was too dull. I would not watch again.
0446528056|5.0|From my prospective, I give this book a 10. It was absolutely beautiful, powerful, and moving. It was full of desire, love, heart-break, regret, and so many emotions that I just couldn't put this book down. I read it in no time because I had to read about Savannah and John's happy ending, but when it didn't happened, I was so lost for words. I couldn't get the ending out of my head for atleast a week and I couldn't get over the love that John carried for Savannah. So much, that he left her so she would be happy with Tim. This book will definitely teach you a thing or two about love and the true meaning. Nicholas Spark did a fine job on writing this love-story and as of now, is my favorite author. I definitely recommend reading Dear John!
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Why did the chicken cross the road?<br /><br />To see Mamma Mia! Of course.<br /><br />What well heeled, high class poultry wouldn't want to see Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth belt out ABBA standards amidst the Greek Isles?  Sure, they aren't all recording stars, and Brosnan can scarcely carry a tune, but the premise of the film/musical is delightful.  Getting married?  Look for your Dad, or dads in the case of Sophia.  I think the best part of the film is probably Sophia standing in the church screaming that she doesn't care how many men she slept with while the 'dads' scramble and the priest looks on.  This could have been a Jane Austen ending with two weddings, but it's not!<br /><br />The music is wonderful, and the acting is almost clumsy.  But with the film set up, it can't help it.  Men in uncomfortable situations do stupid things.  Women fighting love do the same.  Cinematography?  The weak point, but when you watch this film, the scenery is stunning!<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Abba will sell 10,000,000 more albums this year.<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta
0345308239|5.0|I bought this book for its largish (~150 pgs) final section on Vietnam, a \\"war\\" I had been too young to understand at the time.  This section is absolutely prescient vis-a-vis the Iraq debacle.  Case in point, the Tonkin Gulf resolution was the precursor to the 2002's Iraq resolution, right down to its timing: before an election.  Obviously nobody in the Bush administration read this, or if they did, they missed the point, or if they didn't miss the point, they didn't verbalize it, or if they did verbalize it, they were ignored.  General Powell certainly wasn't unaware of the similarities as he so famously retorted that \\"Iraq is not a swamp\\" when questioned about the possibility the US was getting itself into another Vietnam: apparently not being a swamp was the ONLY difference he could see.  And so, as Santayana foresaw, history repeated itself.  Tuchman like Santayana also has a penchant for phrasing with the potential for eternal quotability; e.g., as regard Lyndon Johnson: \\"No one is so sure of his premises as the man who knows too little\\"
B001ILHY1I|5.0|After watching \\"Death Race\\" with Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson, I had to take a long breath.<br /><br />\\"Death Race\\" is a remake of the original Roger Corman film from 1973 that is still fondly remembered and is considered a cult classic.  Once you see this version, you will promptly forget Carradine and remember Jason Statham for a long time.<br /><br />This is truly an action film.  There are races based on speed, based on weaponry, and perils that are orchestrated by the prion matron/action director of a live Terminal Island race to the death seen around the world.  Talk about the ultimate reality show!  Forget being voted off the island, or voted off Idol.  Try surviving the armored speed vehicle assault squad.  Fire, oil, nails, napalm, and falling metal are only some of their favorite things.<br /><br />The wrongly convicted Jensen Ames, aka Frankenstein, is driving for his life against mass murderers and felons.  Death has no meaning except for a way to advance to freedom.  His co-operation has been assured by the blackmail of Hennessey and the location of his daughter.  The race is only part of the appeal of this film.<br /><br />Surprisingly, behind the violence and tough language, a great film lives.  There is drama, compassion, and a fight for freedom amidst the most dangerous of circumstances.  Yep, only a cable TV audience can inspire the severely twisted!<br /><br />The stunts are terrific.  The special effects explosive.  And the cast is perfect.  No pretty boys here.<br /><br />The special features include 'Start Your Engines', 'Behind the Wheel', 'Stunts' and a commentary.  My version includes both the rated and unrated versions.<br /><br />Don't expect your kids to drive like this!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta

1416595546|3.0|This fictional book about the Soviet Union begins in 1916 with a young woman, the Baroness Alexandra (Sashenka) Zeitlin, being arrested at the Smolny Institute for Noble Girls for political activity.  She is a dedicated Communist, enlisted and trained by her uncle Mendel Barmakid.  The book is actually divided into three parts.  The first part takes place in 1916 and 1917 and covers the Revolution and ends in the office of Lenin with the former baroness as a secretary to Lenin.  The first part of the book is very good, engaging, and well-written.  We proceed to the second section, in which the main character Sashenka confronts the Stalin Era Terror.  She is arrested for spying for the British and the Japanese and the Trotskyites.  The second section is hard to get through - the writing style is different and not anywhere near as skillful as the first part.  The second section ends with Sashenka's two children surrendered for adoption.  The third section is once again well-written with appreciable tension and skill.  Overall, I enjoyed the book but I confess to almost quitting during the second part and this is the reason I am giving it only 3 stars.
0671449028|5.0|My son loves listening to this book before bed at night. He is now 3 years old, and still loves to read this book along with other longer books, such as Green Eggs and Ham, or Bad Dog Marley. I have read this book to him so many times that I have it memorized \\" The sun has set not long ago...now everybody goes below...to take a bath in one big tub, with soap all over, scrub, scrub, scrub.\\" It's a great book for bedtime, because in the end of the book all the characters go to bed. Nice way to get him to think about sleeping.
1439102813|4.0|I think most people would, if allowed the choice, choose a quick, even painful death over the slow and gradual loss of their mind. I know I would. I have never spent an extended amount of time with anyone living with Alzheimers but I have often looked at brilliant professors I've had or family members and thought that the cruelest way for them to go would be through Alzheimers. After reading Still Alice, I can imagine so much clearer the sheer torture and pain that this disease inflicts upon its victims and their family and friends.<br /><br />Lisa Genova has written a stunning portrait of a woman just 50 years old and diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers. Alice is a highly intelligent professor with a husband and grown children. As her disease progresses from forgetting a few things here and there to being unable to recognize her family; the reader is taken along every step of the way. Your heart will break.<br /><br />Genova's first novel is remarkably well written and touching. I felt I was there with Alice throughout the story. My only `complaint' would have to be that some of the dialogue seems stilted or forced. I do think one of the most difficult aspects of writing fiction is to create realistic, moving dialogue. Regardless, whether you've been affected by this horrible disease or like me you've just heard about it--this book will change your perspective and touch you deeply.

0765316897|5.0|I must say, Brandon is really making a place for himself in the fantasy market. I've read all of Brandon's published books, and this is definitely his best book.     If anyone is wondering about Mr. Sanderson as an author (because he is going to be finishing up  Robert Jordan's legacy) they should definitely read this series.     Are there faults with the book? Yes, there are, but they are far outweighed by the shear epicness of the last half of the book. Something will always happen that you don't expect.    [...] He is probably more in-touch with his reader base than any other other. I've never seen an author so in touch with his fans, and so open about his books. He'll even post on forums with you.    Without a doubt, Mr. Sanderson has become one of my favorite authors, and his future books should place him up there with the great fantasy authors of our time

B001JRYH2K|5.0|I have Waited YEARS For Yentl to be released on DVD(have an old vhs copy that has been played over and over again)!  For the past 5 years there was always rumors that this DVD was going to be released only to have the release date always pushed back because Barbra wanted to get the DVD Just Right! I am sure it will be worth the wait(Definatley worth the price, cant believe I will get this for under $10). This is the GREATEST of all of Barbra's Films and this film is by far the most personal of Barbra's. My all time favorite Streisand song is \\"A Piece of Sky\\" and when she sings it in the film, it is one of the all time greatest scenes in Cinema History. I was reading some of the other reviews and Barbra Fans are known for Being Picky(like Barbra herself which is why she took her time in releasing the DVD) and I wasnt surprised to read some of the comments referring to \\"widescreen vs fullscreen\\" or \\"Sound\\" or \\"Extras\\". I myself would take this film on dvd any way I could get it BUT rest assured, the dvd is in widescreen(do they even make fullscreen anymore?), highest quality sound and is loaded with extras(11 deleted scenes + commentary from Streisand herself). I AM GETTING VERKLEMPT!
0743455967|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King since I was a teenager. This book give the reader both an inside look into his rise to fame and some very sound writing advice. I had been an aspiring writer since my teens as well, but I could never get it quite right. My scripts had a good scene or two, but then they felt forced. Then I read \\"On Writing,\\" and King's method of developing characters made perfect sense to me. Every writer could find not only writing tips but also inspiration in this book.<br /><br />Now I'm a published author with an award-winning book ([[ASIN:0981744311 Rowan of the Wood]]), and it is in part due to what I learned from this book.

0545128285|5.0|Okay. Stole the title from Hank Green's song, but it's so true! Once again, I'm left with wanting more from Rowling. Although, I am so grateful for having this little book after the end of the HP saga. It was like the cherry on top of an already delicious sundae! The narration by Dumbledore was almost like having him back again. I hope to see more from this author, even just little snippets like this, so that we can keep the magic of Harry Potter in our lives.<br /><br />Christine & Ethan Rose are the authors of the new award-winning fantasy adventure tale [[ASIN:0981744311 Rowan of the Wood]].
B00005JLKN|4.0|I must preface my review of this movie. It's much better if you haven't recently watched The Silence and Hannibal. Onto the actual movie itself.  Anthony Hopkins is again excellent in the character that he is now world renowned as. Edward Norton does a nice job as the brooding FBI agent who reluctantly has to deal with Dr. Lector and Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the stricken serial killer, who we in time gain a modicum of sympathy for. However, the movie fails to match the first installment of the series for a pair of reasons.    1) The ending was extremely rushed and lacked any real suspense. It was as if two high school kids had read the first 3/4ths of the screenplay, then cooked up an ending before rushing off to a pizza date. 2) There was a lack of background concerning the films main characters, both Will Graham (Norton) and Francis Dolarhyde(Fiennes). The movie glosses over both their respective pasts with little more than one brief scene each.     So what was really good about the movie? The acting performances were superb and the movie seemed to have good flow, for the most part. In ranking the quality of the three films, Silence is number 1, this is 2 and Hannibal is 3.
031606792X|2.0|I read the first three in the series, and although I thought they were all a little overwritten, but this one is the worst of all. Whereas the first three could've been perhaps a 1/3 shorter for a tighter story, this book could've been cut in half. It actually became painful to continue reading. ***SPOILERS*** Too much of wolves running around and around and around the Cullen place while Bella is pregnant with some kind of seeming monster that's killing her from the inside out...then, after Renesmee (the absolute most horrible character name I've ever read) is born, it turns out that Jacob imprints on her, and that's just downright creepy. ***END SPOILERS*** I couldn't read anymore after that. By the time the Volturi showed up (200 pages of the end of a 750 page book), I just stalled. Finally started getting exciting and interesting, and I was just tired of trying.<br /><br />Christine & Ethan Rose are the authors of the new fantasy series [[ASIN:0981744311 Rowan of the Wood]].

B001NB6IN8|4.0|For the older fans who still associate the sound of Fall Out Boy with songs like Dance Dance, this cd may require more than one listen before it becomes a favorite. That being said, if you bought Infinity on High and are still interested in Folie a Deux, then there will be no problem.     For new fans, you are in luck. This cd sounds a lot like the last one, with slower, mellower songs- Fall Out Boy is growing up, and it sounds good.     I still miss the old less complex sounding Fall Out Boy but I still love everything they do, so I can't complain. This cd is great!

B000VDDDVO|5.0|I usually can't be bothered with any movie that's in black and white.  If the filmmakers can't go through the trouble of filming it on color film, then don't expect me to watch it.      And it's not just old movies, either.  When Steven Spielberg opted to cut costs by filming \\"Schindler's List\\" in black and white, he lost one ticket-buyer - me!    That's why I was THRILLED when they released a colorized version of \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" the supposedly classic film starring James Stewart and Donna Reed.  Finally someone took the time to make an old, boring film look fresh and modern by using vibrant colors!    Did you know what color George Bailey's jacket was?  Well, it's black.  Did you know that the walls in Mr. Potter's office were gray, or that the snow in Bedford Falls was white?  You see, you'd never know these things if you only watched the inferior black and white version.      The best part about the colorized version of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (other than the color) is that it's presented in fullscreen aspect ratio.  That means it doesn't have any of those annoying black bars on the top and bottom of the picture, making everything really small and hard to see.     If you're a lover of classic films but are annoyed by \\"artistic touches\\" like black and white, then the colorized version of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is for you.    The only thing this new version is missing is a soundtrack featuring songs by John Mayer.
1582701709|5.0|I say YES  to this book...why?...deeply insightful theory & amazingly effective practice is offered in \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne...if & only if you can read the book carefully & if you are able to integrate the theory into your life.    Essentially the theory advocates three key insights:    1. Ask    2. Believe    3. Receive    However, you may miss this one important point...to effectively put this theory into practice you must have \\"Inner Peace\\" first!      I recommend The Secret as one of the best books about transforming your life & even better read together with \\"Nexus\\" by Morrison & Singh , so check out the Nexus page which offers an incredible deal if you purchase \\"The Secret\\" and \\"The Law of Attraction\\" and \\"Nexus\\" together...this is a surprisingly great gift!!!

B00149JKDO|4.0|The peaceful town of North Bend, Washington is terrorized by a serial killer only known as \\"The North Bend Reaper.\\" He was a hulking figure in a skull mask whom adorned himself in a cloak made from swatches of material taken from his victim's attire. In 1988 he killed multiple citizens in the area, before disappearing, apparently killed by three hunters out for revenge.         In present day, a troupe of actors, led by Ben Traimer (Todd Hann), is starting a murder mystery party company very near where the original tragedies of 1988 took place. The town is in an uproar because the murder mystery is going to be based on the local legend - the North Bend Reaper. Because of this, the location of the party is being kept top secret - a summer camp closed for the Fall.          Besides those involved in the company, the guests for the weekend include Therese and Tibor (Tristan Risk and Dave Cote), Joseph (Mike Coleman) an investigative reporter, Andrew (Steve McGowan) who thinks with his little head, and Rosemary (Patricia Nudd) and Lisa (Angie Zachary). Actor Drieghton (Benjamin Gutknecht), who wears Alice Cooper Makeup and dresses as a mod pallbearer, runs the weekend's events.  The guest that solves the \\"Slasher-Flick\\" murder mystery by the end of the weekend wins a cash prize of $500.         The only problem is that this has all caught the attention of the original North Bend Reaper, and there are going to be some real murders at the Murder Mystery gathering...    So, I have watched this movie a few times, and I cannot understand why people are jumping all over it so negatively. It is actually a pretty well put together slasher - certainly more intelligent than most that I have seen. The story is very sound, and the actors do not embarrass themselves. If anything they look like they are having a tremendously good time. The character of Dreighton is a true stand out. The design on the North Bend Reaper costume is excellent. And, Lee Tomaschefski is drop dead gorgeous.I wish she had had a nude scene.     Are the murders themselves graphic? No, but there ARE brutal. This little indie film has a true professional sheen to it. The production value is tremendous for what must have been a very low budget. The writing suffers at times, there are a few logistical problems, but overal you can tell that those in charge cared and did their damndest to deliver entertainment - and they do.     Sure, some of the characters are a little cliched, but most are fleshed out a little more than is normal for this sort of fare. The murder \\"game\\" itself looks like a lot of fun, and I wish we had a little more of that on the screen; maybe an extra could have been the actual game. The ending - which I feel is an open ending - is well done. Not everything is wrapped into a neat package, but at the same time it MAKES SENSE. How many slashers can boast that?      This film has gotten good reviews as well. I would side with those as I think that if you give DARKEST HOUR a chance, you will enjoy it. I am happy that I own it, and it definately is worth a rental. Extras on the disc include outtakes and deleted scenes, as well as trailers. I truly wish it had come with a commentary track.    Check it out!
0131103628|3.0|Its got good information for sure, and the author is obviously knowledgeable, but in all honesty I had a harder time reading his writing than just reading the code ... far to many obscure / unnecessary words used that do not relate to programming.

B00000K3CM|3.0|Did you love Home Alone so much that you wished you could watch it again, only this time in New York? Well, you got your wish my friend. This movie is almost a carbon copy of the original with a different setting, right down to Catherine O'Hara's screaming \\"Kevin!\\"<br /><br />The family is off to Florida for a Christmas vacation, but at the airport, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) accidentally follows a man that looks like his father into a plane headed for New York. When he finds out he has made another blunder, he isn't scared at all. He takes in the sights (including the World Trade Center) and checks into the Plaza Hotel. A goofy bellboy (Rob Schneider) and a suspicious clerk (Tim Curry) give him some trouble, but Kevin has no trouble tricking them with a few clips from Angels With Even Dirtier Faces. He meets a kindly toy shop owner (Eddie Bracken) and is distressed to find that his old friends the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) have busted out of prison and plan to rob the toy store.<br /><br />The big fight against the robbers at the end of the film isn't done in quite the same way as the first film. It has far too many \\"bang\\" and \\"wham\\" sounds to be anything but childish and foreshadows the low quality sequels to follow.<br /><br />And notice all that great product placement? American Airlines must have made a hefty bundle from all of the times the company logo was shown in this film, and I know I really wanted a Talk Boy when I was a kid.<br /><br />This is a good movie for kids and adults who were kids when the movie came out, but you might find yourself groaning about how predictable the plot is.
0060594896|5.0|Our 25-year-old daughter, who just graduated from college in Dec, got this book from her grandmother.  She has been reading it cover-to-cover and loves it.  Even her friends are borrowing it from her.  As a recent December graduate in these hard economic times -- it has been a real boost to her.  Very motivational and inspiring!  I hear excerpts from it from her daily!<br /><br />I haven't read it yet myself, and was actually on the Amazon website to order a copy for ME.  Thought I'd right the review (based on my daughter's review) while I was here.  Also plan on buying the teen version for a grandchild.
0553573403|5.0|But I absolutely loved this book.  I have never liked reading about kings, knights, war, blah blah blah... I could never follow the story.  But this book is very readable.  I became consumed with the characters, I found myself wanting to know everything about them, like they became a kind of family for me. I couldn't believe how swiftly I read this book. I love how the chapters are a different view point from a different character everytime, it became hard to pinpoint the bad guy right away.  I loved this book, I can't wait to read the next one, and I really can't wait for the series to come to television.  Good show George!!  You have made the top ten for sure, possibly even my top five!
B001232NG8|5.0|When I was young there were these two girls that said that I should stop by Whisky Au Go Go in West Hollywood to see this new band called The Doors.  They were of course crazy about the lead singer but they knew I would like the sound.  Well, they were right and as years went by the band became bigger than life.  I bought this album when it first came out, before the hits from it were classic.  Now downloading this new version is such a pleasure because the quality of the remix is so much like what I heard at the old Whisky. There are things there that were hard to hear in the old versions both vinyl and CD. Now at 58 years old I have redisovered this great album and I am speading the news.  Come On Baby Light My?????

B0011NVCO8|4.0|The movie itself was amazing.  I love most movies With Denzel Washington in them.  For some reason though, the HD side of my disc would not play.  It is almost like the manufacturer just did not put any data on the HD side.  When you look at the HD side of the disc, there is no line where the data stops.  The SD side works fine though.  Unfortunately, I did not actually attempt to play the HD side on my HD DVD player until long after the return policy was up.  This was probably just an isolated incident which is why I still gave it 4 stars.  The movie itself is definitely 5 stars.  Be sure you check both sides of the disc within the time limit of the return policy.  Besides that, enjoy this great movie!
B00006RJHG|5.0|I have to say, the original Black Christmas is a film that I only saw in bits and pieces until recently.  I hate admitting it, but I also saw the [[ASIN:B001EAWME2 remake]] in its entirety first.  I even made the mistake of thinking [[ASIN:B000E1ZBIG When a Stranger Calls]] was made first.  Black Christmas is the first movie to use the old \\"The calls are coming from inside the house\\" clich&eacute;.  This oversight is also consistent with my overlooking Black Christmas as creating the template for slasher movies, and instead giving sole credit to the classic [[ASIN:B000RIWAVW Halloween]], which was made years later.  So, Black Christmas was unquestionably crucial in the development of horror films in the years to come.  It is monumental in that sense several times over, but it also happens to be a film that possesses both schocking and creepy moments, and an outstanding horror atmosphere that is strongly assisted by unique camerawork and a great score.  This really is a hugely significant movie for those of us who care about horror films.<br /><br />Black Christmas is directed by Bob Clark, who, ironically perhaps, directed the Christmas movie standard, [[ASIN:B001CFLGMS A Christmas Story]].  It stars John Saxson and Olivia Hussey.  I remember Hussey fondly from seeing her as Juliet in the 1968 film version of [[ASIN:0792165055 Romeo & Juliet]].  I've always thought that she could very well be one of the most attractive women to ever exist.  It also stars Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin before anyone knew who they were.<br /><br />The story is supposedly based on some real-life events that took place in Montreal around Christmas.  A sorority house begins getting random obscene calls that get more and more obscene, and eventually descend to bizarre madness and threats of murder.  People go missing and the calls continue.  This is paralleled with a side story of Jessica's (Hussey) relationship with Peter (Keir Dullea) that eventually works effectively toward the movie's climax.<br /><br />The film ends mysteriously and with subtle despair.  It was more than appropriate and actually quite terrifying.  This is an important movie that will scare you.  It is also a welcome change of pace from the many sappy holiday films we might see this time of year.  I highly recommend this classic.film ends mysteriously and with subtle despair.

B001E7OO2I|1.0|I will never let any of these reviews persuade me into wasting money again. I'm beginning to believe there are some inside people writing the reviews. I cant believe this album has over 1 star and that star would only be for the GREEN LIGHT single. The only good songs on the album is when he is featuring someone else, so that makes it a total of what? 3 good songs enough to make the necessary amount of videos to fool more innocent people into buying his cd . This album is definitely not better than the last, maybe the 1st, which again only had one good single. We don't need to be settling for albums like this in these ruff times, artists need to start picking it up, QUICK!
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I didn't know about Loreena McKennitt before I got this CD.  I bought it on a whim as I heard she's similar to Enya, and I love Enya. And after listening to Amazon's preview songs, I liked what I heard, so I decided to take a chance on her.  I'm so glad I did, because I absolutely love this CD. McKennitt's music grows on you quickly, reaching deep.  It's truly exquisite and so unique.  Her voice is like an angel's. I can't get enough of her music.  I'm going to buy all of her CDs.      If you like Enya, you're sure to like her.

074322454X|3.0|In this book, Ambrose crafts a narrative out of recollected war stories of a company of American paratroopers.  It's surprisingly unemotional for a war story, largely because the participants aren't characterized very well.  The company commander, Dick Winters, and a few others come alive in this story.  Unfortunately, most of the men get about the same treatment as the enlisted man in StarTrek episodes who is doomed to die on the planet.  When death occurs, it's more  matter-of-fact than it should be.<br /><br />The best part of the book comes, surprisingly, in training camp.  Ambrose has time to introduce the regiment to us, and does it well.  The most depressing part of the book comes when the war is over.  One man after another succumbs to automobile accidents, drunken debaucheries, or cases of mistaken identity.<br /><br />So, this book was a disappointment.  I'm sure that the men thought of themselves as a band of brothers but the reasons for that friendship don't come across at all well.
B001F12J48|1.0|We love the Polar Express. It is my kids' favorite holiday movie so I have watched it dozens of times. Buy the movie, just not this version. The 3-D effects are just terrible and they gave us a headache. We tried following every tip they gave us, but we couldn't get it to work at all. Even tried using nicer glasses we had from watching the Nightmare Before Christmas in 3-D. No change. Now we don't use the 3-D disk at all so we paid extra money to watch the widescreen version.

B001GZ6QC4|1.0|One would expect something better from this movie. After all, the cast is impressive and other episodes have done fairly well. Yet, the movie and its actors manage to be bad where there was no room to fail. If you still want to see it, rent it: it would be cheaper and the disappointment bearable.

1439102813|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I'm surprised that it is Dr. Genova's first novel as it was well-written and easy flowing. I wished I could have read it in one sitting - I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />There is the Harvard Professor in her early-fifties, Alice. She is married to another Harvard Professor, John. Alice & John have 3 grown children.<br /><br />The reader is taken on a journey through the mind of Alice who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  The reader shares Alice's thoughts - first as a very intelligent, coherent intellectual who just misplaces a few items or forgets a meeting here and there - through 2 years of her life.  We read how her disease progresses (rather quickly) and share her frustrations with memory loss, hallucinations/delusions, etc.  Toward the end of the 2-year period, Alice is now in a state of limbo - meaning she has a hard time recognizing her family members or why/what she is doing and where.<br /><br />The author has  PhD in neuroscience from Harvard and is an online columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association.  With this experience, she gives us an intimate look at an individual's struggle with this wretched disease with an awareness that it doesn't just affect those in the \\"Winter\\" of their lives.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I watched a family member suffer from this disease and now it gave me a better insight on what she may have gone through as the disease progressed.  Even from just a \\"story\\" aspect, it is still a great read.

6304779356|2.0|I would like to stress that I AM REVIEWING THIS PARTICULAR DVD RELEASE, NOT THE MOVIE.  That's why it's getting such a low mark from me.  Obviously I like the movie, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it.  However, I was very disappointed with this DVD's menu options and 'special features'.  The menu has no 'play button'.  That's right.  No 'play movie' option.  You can only 'select a scene' (which requires 2 clicks in order to actually start the movie from the beginning).  Lame.  And, the special features are nothing more than trivia 'readers'.  Basically, the lamest kind of special features to have.  Needless-to-say, I was very disappointed.  It's a shame they didn't make a better product to preserve and honor a modern cult classic.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Very few have the hard hit that these guys produce. Excellent riffs, hard hittin drum beats, Bon Scott was a real power house without a doubt. If you love rock & roll, you must put this one in your collection. 5 STARS baby..

0316017922|5.0|I think this book is just great.  The basic premise is interesting, it is well argued, and well written.  Is it an exhaustive treatment of the subject - no.  It is a highly entertaining and provocative introduction.    If you think the universe is fair, or ought to be, you are not going to like this book.  If you are interested in why some succeed whereas others - just as smart, just as hardworking and maybe more so, do not do so well - then this is a book for you.    I particularly loved his bits about the transported Italian town in Pennsylvania, about airplane crashes, and why it is hard to expect our school children to successfully compete with Japanese school children on standardized international tests when we go to school 180 short days a year and they go to school 240 long days a year.    If this is your field of expertise - you are not going to like this book, it is too thin on material - but as an introduction to this way to thinking about the world it is a book I highly recommend.  Incidentally, the subtitle for this book could be It Takes a Village to Raise a Child - at least if you want them to succeed.

0743298039|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I started it many, many months ago, then put it down and didn't return to it until recently. I think it's one of those books - at least for me - that took a while to get going, but once it did, boy did it speed by. I particularly liked how the reader is kept guessing until the very end.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Musicals normally arent my thing, but i love ABBA, so i was torn. After hearing and seeing so many great reviews from others who'd seen the movie, i finally gave in and decided to go. What a big surprise! Sure the singing and acting isnt top notch, but i have to say this was the most fun ive had at a movie in ages. The whole audience was singing and dancing in the ailes right along. Meryl Streep was a surprise singing, not bad at all. Everyone actually sang well except Pierce, but bless his heart he tried lol. He even admitted he cant sing but still had a great time doing the movie, so you gotta love him for that lol. Definatly not an oscar caliber movie, but for a fun, feel good movie, this is a must see.

0307269752|3.0|Like many others, I was drawn in by the cover of this book, which can often be a foolish thing. In this case, it was relatively good. The writing isn't unbelievably lyrical, but the story is solid. I would have far preferred to have seen the hacker Lisbeth as the focal point of the story, versus Mikael Blomkvist, the financial journalist who has fallen from grace.<br /><br />Overall, a solidly 3 star novel. I doubt I will pick up the next, but I don't regret reading this first one either.

B001FEA9QU|3.0|If four dudes quit their daytime jobs working as bartenders and junkyard dealers, Then formed a band and played these same tunes you hear on this cd, It would go unheard, it wouldn't sell a fraction as much.   My point is, its not the music selling its self, its not good enough for that. Its just the fact that its Metallica!   People change over time and I think a artist's music should change with them, otherwise they're just trying to stay cool and not just being cool.But then again, Metallica is suppose to be one of the greatest metal bands ever! They could never not be metal could they?  The music isn't bad, some is actually good. But from metalgods I expect Perfect metal music.
0385340990|5.0|[[ASIN:0385340990 The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society]] This is the best book I have read in years!  When I saw that the entire book was written with letters, I was very dubious at first.  However, it is charming and totaly engrossing.  I have read it three times already, and each time I enjoyed it more.  And I learned so much more about what happened in England and the Ilse of Gurendsy during and after World War II.  The characters really come alive.  So much, I would love to meet them in person.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this book as an eceptional read.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|You have to hear this album to believe it.  Sigur Ros gets better and better every time out.  The emotional high they create is more lasting than any music out there today.  They are the most under appreciated band of our time.  The average person on the street wouldn't know who they are.  Hopefully with this album, that will start to change.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|THE MOVIE<br /><br />I'm going to be keeping this spoiler-free, so don't be afraid to keep reading. I hate it when reviewers give away key plot details, it really hurts the movie experience. Speaking of which: you need to see this movie in IMAX if it all possible (they're doing a re-release in January 2009). It's worth the extra few bucks, trust me. Christopher Nolan shot at least 6 scenes in the movie using IMAX cameras, and it shows.<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock: this movie is a direct sequel to Batman Begins and is not at all related to the prior Batman films. The main premise is that the organized crime in Gotham, under siege from Batman, turn to The Joker for help and, naturally, chaos ensues. This movie is hands-down the best comic book movie ever made. It took my high expectations and just shattered them. This movie doesn't just blow away [[ASIN:B001GAPC1K Iron Man]], it really outshines [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]] in its dialogue, pacing, and action scenes. This is Batman the way it was meant to be experienced and really combines the elements that make Batman my favorite comic book/animated series.<br /><br />There's so much to love about this movie that I'm not sure where I should start. I think I'll go with the acting: Heath Ledger steals the show as Joker among an already incredible cast. He doesn't just portray the Joker, but for 2 and a half hours he is the Joker. I can't think of the last time I saw an actor nail a role so well that I couldn't even believe it was them in the role. I'm not saying I thought he was a bad actor before, but just the voice and makeup and everything transforms him into a completely different person. He's so good that I'm sure Jack Nicholson will see it and say, \\"Wow, he was good!\\" If you go to this movie for no other reason it should be to see Ledger in his best role ever. It's so sad to know that he can't come back in a future Batman film or any film at all. If you ever doubted his abilities as an actor, this movie will embarrass you.<br /><br />The rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either. Christian Bale is an even better Bruce Wayne than before and really takes on a darker, grittier Batman. This movie is really dark, and Bale doesn't shy away from this. Michael Caine IS, well, Alfred. He was in the first movie and he is here also; he defines what it means to be Alfred. If you've seen the first one (which you really should before walking into this one, but don't absolutely have to) then you know what to expect here. Maggie Gyllenhaal really steals Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes because it will amaze you that Katie Holmes ever could have been Rachel Dawes. I always felt that Gyllenhaal was underrated and it shows in this film. Aaron Eckhart was the perfect man to play Harvey Dent. The concept of a DA with a passion for justice is not lost on Eckhart. He starts off as being not bad and then progressively just gets deeper and deeper into the role. Morgan Freeman's character is given more screen time in this one and while I would've loved to have seen his character fleshed out a little more I appreciate their time restrictions also.<br /><br />Speaking of which: the worst thing you can drudge up about this movie is how dense it is. It's 2 and a half hours long and a lot happens, but I feel like it's paced well enough so that you'll always want to know what happens next and you can't possibly be bored. You probably will laugh, cry, and jump in your seat (or squirm) during this movie, it's just that powerful. I love the dark humor because I love dark humor in general, and the delivery is always impeccable. The dialogue in this movie is decidedly more mature when compared to its predecessor, which I think is saying a lot (probably because David Goyer was not a part of writing this one, just in conceiving it). Getting back to my point though: there are several plots throughout this movie that do all tie together but can get confusing if you don't pay attention. Of course, I just look at this as giving more re-watch value to the film. There's so many little details to appreciate and the cinematography is so spot-on that you can't help but want to watch certain scenes again and again. The special effects are never too heavy and are always just welcome inclusions.<br /><br />This movie should not be seen by small children. Seriously, if you're under 14 then you have no business seeing this movie. It's not curse words or violence (though there's not much cursing and there's absolutely no nudity), but rather the themes that this movie revolves around. They're dark, complicated, and involve a lot of moral gray area. Besides, the Joker would probably seriously creep out anyone that young (I'd be surprise if he didn't give some adults bad dreams). The haunting imagery in this movie will likely stick with you, but you have to appreciate the fact that these characters are likely to stick with you. You really care about them and feel involved in their lives.<br /><br />I give this movie an A+ with my highest recommendation for you to run out and see it right now. Please, go see it in IMAX if you can, and Blu-ray if you can't. If you are above the age of 16 and you do not see this movie then something is wrong with you. Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />THE BLU-RAY SET<br /><br />Does it look every bit as good on Blu-ray as it did on the big screen? For the most part, yes. I think that when you watch a movie with as dark as palette as this one the scenes with a lot of black don't look as good as you may remember on the big screen. The IMAX scenes are pretty much breathtaking. I was a little disappointed with how they enforced the IMAX aspect ratio: the IMAX shots will take up your whole screen whereas the rest of the movie will have black bars at the top and bottom. Since my other Blu-ray movies don't do that, it makes me feel a little cheated. Still, they're fairly thin bars and the quality is pretty amazing for the rest of the movie also. The only flaws you're really going to find in the other scenes in the movie are just noise in the backgrounds occasionally, but you pretty much have to walk right up to your TV (which I hope is HD if you buy this on Blu-ray) to notice this noise. The edges are razor sharp all around and I can't recall seeing any artifacts. I think it doesn't look as good as [[ASIN:B001EOQWF8 Wall-E]] simply because the colors in the movie itself aren't as vivid, but they're definitely crystal clear and ensure that you won't miss a single detail in a single frame. So don't buy too much into what some critics are saying, I still think it's worth your money video quality-wise (I can't speak for the DVD version though because I haven't seen it). The sound is even better though. Even on my simulated surround sound, it never comes close to disappointing. It gives you that true movie theater experience with explosions you can almost smell and gunfire that's almost too realistic. The score shines pretty well also.<br /><br />Now for the weakest part of this set, if you can even call it that: the extras. I didn't try out the digital copy, but I did try out BD Live and perused the other extras on both discs. The BD Live content is nothing particularly exciting. You can create and watch video commentary, which I think is kind of a gimmicky. You can also do live chats. The other main feature is the ability to watch movie trailers and other video content that should've been on the disc but wasn't because it wasn't good enough. There were a couple of videos that I was kind of peeved didn't make it on the Blu-ray because they were actually interesting, but the others were animated shorts that added audio to frames of a comic book that was created for the movies. I only watched a couple, and they were terrible. The artwork was just fine, but the dialogue did not sound like Batman at all (I mean the writing, not the voice acting). What's worse about this stuff is that the video size is only a quarter of your screen, are lacking in quality, and buffer terribly. It's best to start playing one, pause it immediately, and then go make yourself hot cocoa while it buffers the video so that you can actually watch it continuously. My cable Internet isn't the bad, but I can stream videos just fine on my laptop. I would've liked to have seen a trivia game or something else on BD Live.<br /><br />The other features are pretty good though. There's no commentary track, which I didn't mind because I rarely listen to those, but you can trigger featurettes at various parts of the movie when you see the appropriate icon, or watch them all entirely outside of the movie. There's about 90 minutes worth of that stuff, and they're pretty fascinating overall. I had never seen an IMAX camera before watching the featurette on it, and it's incredible to imagine how they filmed any action on that thing. On disc 2 you'll find a couple of documentaries that no one has seemed to point out originally aired on the History Channel in the weeks leading up to the release of The Dark Knight: Batman Tech and Batman Unmasked. So when you read reviewers talk about how strange it was that neither of these documentaries include non-trailer scenes from The Dark Knight and only scenes from Batman Begins, you can be a smarty pants and correct them. I thought that they were pretty well-done and great ways to lend another level of realism to this character and world on top of what the movie has to blot out the abominations of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. I especially liked the Unmasked one, a psychological analysis of Batman, because part of what I always liked about him was how dark and gritty and real he would always feel and that he was even thrown into Arkham himself once. There are also some episodes of a Gotham news program that were movie cheesy, but still useful addition in that they help ground the film in what feels like reality. They're almost like deleted scenes, in a way. The other features you have is a smattering of photographs and concept art, and all the trailers and TV spots, which I always love to have to watch long after a movie was released and I'm always bothered when DVDs don't include them. The concept art is pretty awesome, and I really wish that had taken the initiative to let you view them picture-in-picture with the film as an optional layer.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely something worth buying. Even though it's not a monstrous amalgamation of special features, it's a pretty healthy amount that will take even longer than the movie itself to go through, and the quality of everything (besides the BD Live content) was excellent.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: LIVE CHAT EVENT<br /><br />I participated in the live chat event with director Christopher Nolan on December 18 and it was awesome! It was text only, not video. At first I was disappointed, but actually text chat lets you enjoy the movie fully and only tune in to what Nolan is saying when/if you want. It's actually a text box at the top of the screen that's readable without being too big and has a somewhat transparent background so that you can see whatever part of the movie it covers. You ask questions on the WB BD Live site (you had to be logged in, so only people in the chat could ask questions), and Nolan (or perhaps a third-party) goes through and asks as many of the best as quickly as possibly.<br /><br />Sometimes, he picked ones that I thought were kind of dumb or already answered in other features on the disc, but there were a lot of insightful questions answered about the casting, nuances of the story, origins and inspirations, etc. I didn't get any of mine answered, unfortunately, but the event could only support 100,000 people and with 600,000 copies sold on the first day alone (I imagine a significant number from pre-orders), I imagine a number of people were excited about this event a week afterwards.<br /><br />I don't know how often they're going to be doing this, but it was cool. It was the only BD Live feature that I thought was creative and on par with some of the stuff Disney is trying out. I'd love to see them do more live events with actors from the film or even Batman comic experts.start playing one, pause it immediately, and then go make yourself hot cocoa while it buffers the video so that you can actually watch it continuously.

B001GKJ2FW|3.0|I like musicals.  There I've said it.  Someone will surely come by and take my 'man' card for having said so, but I don't care.  I'm man enough to admit that I actually enjoy musicals.  At least in most cases I do.  With Mamma Mia!, at least the movie version (as found on Blu-ray and DVD), well, not so much.<br /><br />Mamma Mia! has been 'a worldwide phenomenon' for as long as I can remember... going back to TV ads blaring for the broadway type show.  Not quite as far back as the days when the band that the music came from was making music, but still for quite a long time.  Inspired by the music of ABBA (sorry, I can't make the backwards B character there), Mamma Mia! uses many of those songs to provide the sound track and even dialogue for a story about a daughter that is getting married, from a single mother who isn't sure which of 3 men fathered that daughter during a magical year many years ago.<br /><br />As a story Mamma Mia! is entertaining enough, and the actors in the film actually do well with their roles except.... well, except for the fact that they have to sing and need to be convincing enough to not have viewers feeling that they're watching a bunch of lip syncing.  It is in this area that Mamma Mia! fails for me, thanks to singing that seems out of sync with the songs that I remember, and worse, thanks to singing from an actor or two that were cast in the film who frankly shouldn't be allowed to sing at all.<br /><br />As a singer, lets just say that Pierce Brosnan shouldn't consider changing his line of work.  It may not be totally horrible, but it's enough to make you wish that Brosnan was busy working on a Bond film or something similar.<br /><br />Meryl Streep does ok with her vocal stylings, but again the pace of some of the singing she does just seems completely off when compared to the radio played songs that they were taken from.<br /><br />Watch this if you feel inspired to, but think carefully before purchase.  For as much 'fun' as this is supposed to be, you may find yourself regretting a purchase and wishing you rented instead.gretting a purchase and wishing you rented instead.
0812548094|4.0|Ronald had known for all his whole life that he would read the book. His father had told him that he would read it before he went away, beyond the enclosure, never to return. His father had taught him many things. How to make akward, declarative sentances. How to kill with violence, when nescessary. When it was good.     Nooly watched Ronald looking at the book. He looked to be interested in it, but is face was frowning. He looked to be thinking about something. Nooly loved Ronald. She had thought for days about how much she cared about him, and had imagined spending dusky evenings eating beans with him while the sun was in the sky. He was a good man. As good as any man she ever knew.     Suddenly, there was a sound in the air. Something happened. Ronald ducked down. Nooly saw him duck. She thought to herself about all of the danger she had ever seen. She realized that a dangerous thing might be above her. She ducked down low, lower even than Ronald. Nearby, a Dirt Person was trying pitifully to scratch out a living in the dirt with primitive, quaint tools. The dangerous thing was on top of the dirt person. The thing cut off the dirt person's hand. Blood was everywhere. The hand was lying in a crimson pool of red blood.     Ronald opened the book. He was the strongest, best person in a five-mile radius. Nooly nervously watched him as blood from the dirt person sprayed everywhere.     Ronald put down the book. \\"I've read this book before. It was not a good book to read. The author was like one of the dirt people. He didn't know about how to build proper indoor plumbing. But I loved the book anyway. I couldn't stop reading it.\\"    Ronald was grasping the large marital aid that he kept tied around his neck and pressed ever to his chest. Nooly understood.

B001GCUNVW|3.0|Depressingly realistic (or vice versa depending on your level of pessimism), Aronofsky's Wrestler does manage a glimmer of hope in a world forsaking those who cannot adjust to change, and a fantastic cast supports Mickey Rourke's powerhouse performance as the downtrodden athlete.  Lighter than Requiem and simpler than The Fountain, The Wrestler provides a grittily realistic, and oftentimes sadly humorous look into the life of a man unable to recover what he's lost outside the ring.<br /><br />Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was once a world-renowned professional wrestler in the `80s, but the spotlight has long since left him and he's reduced to touring the independent circuits.  As he struggles to make ends meet, he attempts to repair the damaged relationship with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), and court a beautiful dancer (Marisa Tomei) working at the strip club he frequents.  But life proves far more difficult outside the ring than in and he feels himself steadily drawn towards the cheering crowds he once knew.<br /><br />Randy doesn't wrestle for money or for pride, but because it is all he has left. His inevitable return to the ring against the warnings of doctors (\\"I'm a professional wrestler,\\" insists Randy. \\"That's not a good idea,\\" the doctor replies) and despite the slowly blossoming relationship with Tomei's Cassidy isn't about choice. He's like Rocky when it comes to heart, but has nothing to prove - not even to himself. He eventually becomes resigned about his many shortcomings, especially in relationships, and realizes that there's only one place he truly belongs. It's never more apparent than in the fantasy-like conclusion and with the end credit song \\"One Trick Pony.\\"<br /><br />The blood and pain is real, even if the fighting is staged. The Ram uses hidden razor blades to summon extra blood when needed and the use of barbed wire and staple guns aren't just props (and they say wrestling is fake). Randy's pain exists even more so outside of the ring, however, when he fails to fix the estranged relationship with his daughter, copes with Cassidy's rejection and struggles with customer service at the Acme grocery store where he works. His inability to succeed in the real world outside of the violent fantasy of the ring is mirrored by Cassidy's job as a stripper - a mask that she believes Randy won't be able to see through. They are all flawed characters set in desperation and a depressing level of hopelessness, but the poignant and convincing performances make The Wrestler a powerful character study, even if Aronofsky's infatuation with digression and emotional torment makes the film often agonizingly bleak.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsthe ring, however, when he fails to fix the estranged relationship with his daughter, copes with Cassidy's rejection and struggles with customer service at the Acme grocery store where he works.

She also says , \\"In your life , you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team . \\" This makes her a good role model for her fans because she encourages them too not waste their entire life on boys .    I can relate to \\" You Belong With Me \\" because I currently like someone who has been my friend for years . Whenever I hear the song I think of him . He has a girlfriend , and so does the boy that Taylor talks about . It's as it Taylor can understand me . She writes all of her songs so emotionally and beautifully , that I feel like she IS me .    As for her originality , the music speaks for itself . She writes and co-writes all of her songs and they all have catchy rythyms that go well with the lyrics . You'll know what I mean when you buy the CD . Its the best CD I own ! You'll love it as much as I do !
B000003TA4|5.0|This is one of a few albums that you can see a significant difference in popular music before and after its release - albums like Sgt. Pepper's.  This album changed music for the better - away from the manufactured hair band drivel from the late 80's and into the 'alternative' rock movement of the 1990s.  We've yet to see another album like this one: someday we will, but every major rock record released since 1992 has some bit of influence by Nirvana - a change in production style towards artist controlled production and away from manufactured rock like Warrant or Poison.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|My freind made me go see this at our local doller theater and thank God I only payed a doller to see this crap! I wanted my doller back after leaving the theater!    Slow, borring, little action, and mostly talking! Thats all that can be said about this movie. Come on Christain that voice you do when your bat-man is so bad. It makes me want to punch a wall!!! I wish I had the time spent in this movie back!!! It was so bad I slept through a good hr. of this movie. My freind jumped in her seat when a body had fallen into a window on a building and that made me wake up but fell back asleep about five seconds later. It seemed to have NO plot. Just random crap. Things exploding. Come on people really look at the movie!!! Its not good!!! You people just like it becouse it has a dead guy in the lead!!! If you took him out of it...and Christain B. would you still have gone to see this crap??? prob. not!
B001KVZ6FC|3.0|Conjuring up elements of both Harry Calahan and William Munny, Clint Eastwood's Walt Kowalski doesn't quite near the brilliance of his previous creations, but a healthy mix of drama, pathos, and an unexpected dose of wit result in a wholly enjoyable experience.  With all the incarnations of this familiar storyline, perhaps nothing new is truly offered, but if Gran Torino teaches us anything, it's that you don't mess with Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a perpetually disgruntled, ornery widower who speaks his mind, especially when it comes to his distaste for religion and his new Korean neighbors.  When he unwittingly saves young Thao (Bee Vang) from a violent gang after finding the youth attempting to steal his prized Gran Torino, Walt determines to reform the boy and an unlikely friendship forms.  But as Walt helps Thao gain confidence and a little worldly wisdom, he realizes that only he can bring justice to the gang that continues to threaten the wellbeing of his new friend.<br /><br />With a precise army snare drum accompaniment, a permanent scowl, and hilariously racist dialogue, Clint Eastwood's Walt Kowalsi is a return to a character audiences love. It's not dissimilar to Will Munny from Unforgiven, and the strong vigilante presence is often cinematic gold. Idiosyncratic and bitter, Walt is the perfect contrast for the much younger supporting characters he interacts with, as well as an opposite for the Hmong traditions he interferes in. The story itself is a far cry from the poignant and heartbreaking sagas Eastwood told with his previous films (Million Dollar Baby, Letters From Iwo Jima and most recently Changeling), but clearly this is a character study. His disgust with religion, inability to let go of the past, the horrible things he witnessed in Korea that can't be forgotten, and the destruction of his lawn gnomes all provoke him to set off on a mission of retribution, defiance and principle that makes for an entertaining journey.<br /><br />The originality of the film is greatly lost simply because of his role in Unforgiven, Dirty Harry and other films that make use of his most famous, irritable vigilante persona. While the story doesn't offer too many surprises, the humor is undeniably refreshing. Walt's attempts to teach Thao how to speak like a real man, his advice on love, and his acquisition of a construction job all provide generous laughs. Although most of it is derived from crude racial slurs, it's still quite funny.  Aside from the entertainment wrought from unpolished humor, the film's morals and plot are tiresomely familiar, yet Eastwood still manages his flair for dramatically cathartic conclusions, and Gran Torino finishes with a sense of accomplishment greater than it likely deserves.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinse originality of the film is greatly lost simply because of his role in Unforgiven, Dirty Harry and other films that make use of his most famous, irritable vigilante persona.

0143034901|4.0|Shadow of the Wind was an enjoyable read for me, even though I know I missed many references made by the author during the telling of the story.  He uses many Spanish words and phrases, and there were references to historical tidbits and such that went right over my head, I know.  It did not detract from the story, but I may have enjoyed it more had they meant something to me.  Set mainly in Barcelona, Spain, in the 50's and 60's, Zafon gives insight into some important historical facts of the era.  He invented interesting, some even zany, three-dimensional characters and gave them such an exciting story -I hated to have to put it down, and counted minutes until I could pick it up again.

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Sophie has been raised on a remote Greek island by her mother Donna (Meryl Streep).  Donna has never told Sophie who her father is, and that has left a hole in Sophie's heart.<br /><br />But as her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper) nears, Sophie finds a journal her mother kept 21 years ago.  In it, she finds three potential candidate for her father, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard).  Convinced that she will know her father on sight, she invites all three men without telling her mother.  But when all three men arrive, Sophie finds herself just as confused as she was before.  And their presence just complicates the wedding plans even further.  Will Donna recover from the surprise?  Will Sophie figure out who her father is?  Will the men discover why they are there?  And just how many great songs can be used to capture the feelings of the characters?<br /><br />I was not familiar with ABBA before I saw the movie, so pretty much had no clue what to expect.  And I loved these songs.  Honestly, if I didn't know where the music originated, I would have told you all the songs were written for the musical.  Not bad for a concept I dismissed as silly a few years back.  But these pop/rock sounds fit the story perfectly.<br /><br />And this cast can sing!  Meryl Streep is especially impressive as Donna, and gets the most songs.  The emotion she gets into so many of the songs is outstanding but hardly surprising considering how great an actress she is.  The only weak link in the singing department was Pierce Brosnan.  He is adequate while the others are outstanding.  But that's a minor point.<br /><br />With the number of songs in the movie, there is no way that they can develop all the characters well, especially since the film is under two hours.  Donna and her two friends are the best developed, followed by Sophie.  Honestly, I was disappointed with how little development Sky got.  I thought he'd play a bigger role.  And I had a hard time keeping the back story on the three potential dads straight.<br /><br />But I was certainly pulled into the story, wanting to know how things would end.  I felt the climax was rushed to make way for one more song, the only time I felt that way about the story.<br /><br />This movie will leave you humming a tune with a smile on your face.

0385340990|5.0|This is one of those little books that you wish would go on and on.  It feels like a letter from home.  The characters are begiling.

This is a treasure and will have a place of honor on my bookshelf.
B001GM7J2S|4.0|Although few people may admit it themselves but to me this is Alan Parsons Project's best album and is certainly my favourite of the lot.  All the tracks are musically interesting and while not true of most of their other albums there are no fillers on this album.  Everyone knows \\"Prime Time\\" and \\"Don't Answer Me\\" but to me these are not even the strongest tracks on this album.  \\"Dancing On A High Wire\\" is my vote for best track here while the title track is also very strong.  \\"Pipeline\\" is also my favourite of all their instrumental pieces.  If I had to name the weakest track here it would be \\"You Don't Believe\\".<br /><br />This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of the album has also been remastered very well by Alan Parsons himself for a very good sound quality and is the way Parsons himself wants it to sound to you given his own personal involvement in the process even though it has nothing to do with the SHM process more of which I have covered in an earlier review.  The sound quality due to the remastering is first class making this the best sounding version of the album that I've ever heard.<br /><br />This mlps (mini-lp replica sleeve) version though is a mixed bag. First the great news: this album has been very well remastered for an excellent sound and has a 12-page colour booklet with an essay by Jerry Ewing of Classic Rock Magazine and liner notes on the bonus tracks written by Eric Woolfson and Alan Parsons themselves.  The 8 bonus tracks are:<br /><br />Track 10:  Don't Answer Me (Early Rough Mix)<br />Track 11:  You Don't Believe (Demo)<br />Track 12:  Since The Last Goodbye (Chris Rainbow Vocal Overdubs)<br />Track 13:  Since the Last Goodbye (Eric Guide Vocal-Rough Mix)<br />Track 14:  You Don't Believe (Instrumental Tribute To The Shadows)<br />Track 15:  Dancing On A High Wire/Spotlight (Work In Progress)<br />Track 16:  Ammonia Avenue Part 1 (Eric Demo Vocal-Rough Mix)<br />Track 17:  Ammonia Avenue (Orchestral Overdub)<br /><br />Also included are another 16-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  The inner jacket sleeve faithfully replicates the original lp with all the tiny lyrics on it.<br /><br />The only beef I have with this and is why I only gave it 4 stars is the actual assembly of the mlps itself which is so disappointingly poor given the quality of the rest of the package. The cardboard is of thin poor quality and looks as if it will fall apart once the glue gets old. For examples of very well assembled mlps designs go see the ones done for the entire Hall & Oates reissue as well as those done for Queen and The Band which are simply works of art which showed those concerned had great pride in their work.<br /><br />Overall, this mlps version of what I believe to be their best album has very good sound quality given the remastering done by Alan Parsons himself but it is rather pricey and the mlps itself is shabbily put together and poorly assembled with thin and poor quality cardboard.  If you already have the remastered cd, it would be difficult to justify paying so much more to get this poor mlps version.English and Japanese.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|What a treat!  I haven't enjoyed a movie so much since I can't remember.  If you love life and music, then this  is for you. This is a fun movie and the acting is great.  Meryl Streep gives an amazing performance and to hear Pierce sing with such emotion was worth the entire movie.  The girl playing Meryl's daughter has a set of pipes that surprises.    If you want to have a fantastic time, then watch this movie.
031606792X|5.0|I really liked this book. Different from the previous three but still very entertaining. I couldn't have wanted any different of an ending for Bella and Edward.   I read some of the reviews and it is obvious they were written by adults. I pre read these for my 11 year old daughter and was suprised I couldn't put them down!We must remember these are listed for YOUNG ADULTS.Keep this in mind when reading some of the reviews. My daughter has been reading like crazy and its fun they we both can read and enjoy a series of books together.(very rare as she is 11)SO I give the whole series five stars and think Young adult and Adult can take something away and have a good dose of fantacy.
1596434252|4.0|This is a very cool book. Basically, it goes through the alphabet from A-Z. Each page is a 3-D cut out that pops out of the page at you as you open each page. The cut-outs are very elaborate and impressive. I'm not sure how educational the book actually is, and some of the letters might be hard to recognize by some children. Also, Im not sure how durable the book would be in the hands of a child. Certainly it would be destroyed quickly by a very young child.  But, it has a nice wow factor too it and so for the right child, it would be a neat gift.

B000HC2LI0|1.0|I am very disappointed in Amazon.com.  I order the complete set of \\"The West Wing\\" on November 28th for a great price of $74.99.  This was to be my son's major Christmas present and there was plenty of time for delivery.  Up until December 18, (for 20 days AFTER I ordered it) I was led to believe it would be delivered by Christmas.  However, late in the day on December 18 I was advised by Amazon that it would NOT be delivered until January 21 to February 3, 2009. Thanks a lot Amazon! Now it will be difficult to get it from any other online source. I hope I can find it in stores.
1400079594|3.0|THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS defied my usual reading style. That style is interactive and generates marginalia, which absolutely fills the white space of books I enjoy. But my copy of TCotW is nearly pristine, with the reading experience provoking few comments. Not to sound pompous; but for me, this novel was dull fluff, albeit a masterful demonstration of voice. Still, I recognize my limits. If I were a Brit or more aware of the conventions of 1930's British social satire, then maybe...<br /><br />TCotW gains life after Wodehouse establishes the character Sir Watkyn Bassett, who is the antagonist of Bertie Wooster, as Bertie is charged with snatching a silver cow creamer and battles, in his twitish way, to foster the nuptials of Stiffy and Madeline. Sir B is a magistrate, host, and wealthy man who Wodehouse eventually endows with gravitas. Once this exists, Bertie's shenanigans become funny, especially in Chapter Nine, when he asks Sir B for permission to marry Stiffy. Without Sir B's grounding, the novel is merely highly-mannered farce and not especially amusing.<br /><br />A good way to read TCotW is to tic the margins whenever Wodehouse uses an archaic or obscure word or expression. \\"How my Aunt Agatha's McIntosh niffed to heaven...\\" \\"She biffed off and I leaned...\\" \\"That's where you're making your bloomer.\\" \\"... a bucket of cold water right into the mazzard.\\" \\"Snootered to the bursting point...\\"  \\"...and come a purler in the bathtub.\\" In his use of such words and expressions, Wodehouse shows he is an exacting and playful writer.
0060254920|5.0|Among the hundreds of books my husband and I have purchased for our seven-year old daughter over the course of her young life, \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" is one of the absolute best.  She loves the freeing world that Max enjoys and its ever-so-slightly dangerous vibe.  When she was younger, my husband and I loved the simple poetry and cadence.  It's fun to read!  It's almost like singing a song.  (My daughter especially loved the female monster.)<br /><br />The message is a good one: our imaginations are rich beyond measure, joy is a universal desire, and one need not go anywhere outside themselves to experience adventure.<br /><br />Let the wild rumpus start!
0307341550|4.0|I loved this book.  My only complaint about it might be that it wasn't long enough, because I wasn't nearly ready for it to end.

1400082773|5.0|After the November presidential election I became interested in reading Obama's own words as told by him long before he was constantly in the spotlight and before he had seriously considered running for President of the United States. I'm glad I did. \\"Dreams From My Father\\" is extremely well written, a necessary trait for any President regardless of who their speechwriters are, and flows like a novel. Obama's tale and life struggles are those that many people face as someone torn between two cultures and heritages, hoping to find where they fit in. Born and largely raised by his mother's parents in Hawaii, the most unique of all fifty states, he learns what it is like to be a Black American at a time when the country was seriously confronting the issue of race. But unlike many Black Americans, his roots to Africa were direct and contemporary, as his father was a Kenyan immigrant to the United States, even if he was absent for almost all of Obama's life. After high school at Punahou and college at Columbia, he chose to work in the south side of Chicago helping strengthen and rebuild communities. Prior to law school, he traveled to Kenya for several weeks to discover his father's side of his family. His description in the book of his African trip, while long and filled with characters, is insightful and moving.<br /><br />This is all prior to entering Harvard Law School, mind you, where he was the first ever black Editor-in-Chief of the Harvard Law Review, not a small feat by any measure. This is an extraordinary man with an excellent mind, numerous talents and a pragmatic approach and view of the world. I am proud to have this man lead my country as I finally feel that the leader of this country represents who America is and what it can become. This is an excellent book for those torn between two cultures or anyone else interested in finding who they are.
0440238609|5.0|A friend recommended these to me when I told her I had been trying to keep up with younger reader materials (Lord of the Rings, Eragon, Twilight, Harry Potter, Narnia, etc). She could not have done me a bigger favor. While the other series listed are very entertaining and I am so happy to see a revival of reading, I did not find many of them to be as well written or engaging as this series. The His Dark Material trilogy is a fascinating fantasy that has a quick moving, quirky plot that keeps younger readers turning the pages, but it also provides a good bit of mental stimulation for older readers. Combining entertainment, moral dilemmas, building empathy and philosophical dynamics, this book has opened up so many discussions across the ages. It is such a great way to bring the family together for reading and discussion. My only caution is gauge what subject matter is appropriate for younger readers because some parts can get a little scary. Pullman is not too shy with death, separation or his suspenseful imagination.

After reading the solid scientific studies relating to nutrition as it relates to disease, we changed our eating habits in concert with the author's recommendations.

0375826726|2.0|What was the point of this book?  The only thing I can come up with is that the company is trying extract the most money they can from the readers that enjoyed the first two books.  The only part where the book really held my interest was while Eragon was visiting Oromis and the very end.  His \\"true\\" father?  What a disappointment.  The memory that Saphira presented Eragon sounded vaguely like Brom, but I could never imagine Brom saying some of the things he did.  And what of Galbatorix?  Of we've heard of him, but never once have we glimpsed his ugly mug.<br /><br />  Oh, Brisingr, I expected so much of you.  Galbatorix, the final match between Eragon and Murtagh, the true name of Eragon, the last war to decide the country's fate, and where Eragon's destiny lay (it has been repeated countless times that he is to leave and never return).  Was I wrong to do so?<br /><br />  We can only pray that the next book will be the last.
031606792X|1.0|Seriously, how anyone could give this a 4 or 5 star review I'll never know. (Although some say people rated this one before the book actually came out, its the only explanation.)    Everything is perfect, bella is the queen of vampires. She does not suffer or have to sacrifice anything in the end, she keeps her mortal and immortal family (plus her child). Everything is tied up in a neat little bow with a few loose ends. Don't get me started on the anti-climatic face off with the volturi.    I'm so in shock it would take me an hour just to post every reason why this sucked! Please read it for yourself but be prepared to be let down by the sugary happy ending.

B000077VR3|2.0|After reading so many of the other reviews, I resign myself to the fact of varied tastes make one man's trash another's treasure.  I picked up a copy and watched it with a friend.  While I am a fan of some obscure Euro flicks that most of my friends cannot understand or enjoy, I just could not get into this movie...The \\"kaleidoscope\\" of people and colours is well enough, the general storyline isn't bad, and the main actors are people I like and make a point of watch filmes they're in.  However, all the music being essentially plagiarized from various pop songs, and characters flipping, running, and jumping about like it is some Kung-Fu movie set in a circus, ruined the show for me, and even the tease-eroticism that can be the spice to make a movie worth the money to guys like me is overshadowed by the general mayhem that make this flick as irritating as a bad radio commercial.  Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it does seem to me that the only people this movie was mad for are the type that still haven't matured from lots of flash and snippits from some overplayed pop icons.  Maybe it's fun for some, so try it and form your own opinion.  But rent it first...you will not have wasted as much movie should you end up feeling like I do about it.
0807126063|5.0|Perhaps one of the best books that no one has heard of. Without spoiling the plot, I find it suffice to say that John Kennedy Toole has created one of the greatest literary characters of the 20th century. This book is hilarious, due in main part to the protagonist of the story. Ignacious is an intelligent, naive, gluttonous, and sloth-like young man finding it difficult to break his outer shell and join the rest of the world in reality. I don't know what else to say, but just need to read this book. You will smile, maybe laugh outloud, but most importantly you will have a great time while reading of his misadventures and strategic blunders.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Won't give you a synopsis; that's been done. However, I've travelled a lot, and those I know who travelled as much as I really love this movie. If you are away from home, whether in another country or another time zone, it's great to find someone to connect with. I'm not talking about finding someone to have sex with, just mere companionship. If you are at a convention, then you have a greater chance of meeting like-minded individuals. But, if you are basically on your own, for a stretch of time, it can become awfully lonely.     Maybe that's what is \\"Lost in Translation.\\" Maybe that's why a lot of folks don't get this movie.

I would never buy a remix of his first three albums and detest the fact so many 70's and 80's classics are being re-done digitally, Led Zeppelin included.  This sort of forced me back into record collecting again, and a clean vinyl record from this era sounds better than any CD ever could.  (ripped to MP3 on my computer of course).    \\"Bark At The Moon\\" is probably the most underappreciated Ozzy album to this day, with possibly his best gem of a song ever \\"Waiting For Darkness\\" stuck at the end of the album.  Hypnotic, great guitar work by Jake E. Lee, and Ozzy embraces Jake's style on this album, deciding not to mimick Rhode's classical overtones and classic rock-metal style at all.    It works and there are some top notch songs on this one that stand up to anything he's ever done, although I lost interest in his music after this album to be honest. It's much like I quit listening to Triumph and Rush after \\"Sport Of Kings\\" and \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" once the mid-80's came around, as a kid.    My personal favorites here that aren't often talked about or played anywhere, are \\"Centre Of Eternity\\" and \\"Waiting For Darkness.\\" \\"Slow Down,\\" the title track, \\"So Tired,\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Rebel\\" all received significant radio airwave time when this was released, and for years after.  But they aren't remembered or re-played a fraction as much as \\"Crazy Train\\" or \\"Over The Mountain\\" or \\"Flying High Again,\\" or his radio songs in the post-Bark era.    I also saw this tour when Motely Crue was opening up for him, touring for \\"Shout At The Devil.\\" Circus magazine was my addiction and hard rock music's hey day, it's debauchery, satanic overtones and all, are what I grew up with.  \\"Bark At The Moon\\" was right in the middle of it all.
0061537934|5.0|I am not a big reader, although I am always reading a book and have read hundreds. Generally I read at night to put myself to sleep.  Sometimes a book takes months to finish that way.  However, I read this amazing book in one day.  I have to admit that as a dog lover, it's initial appeal to me was the fact that a dog was on the cover and a dog tells the story.  But this is far more than just a dog lover's book.  It is an amazingly emotional and heartfelt study in life as viewed through the eyes of one very smart dog. The entire narrative consists of Enzo the dog's perceptions and incredibly insightful views into his and his masters life and the people who join it along the way.  I will say no more to avoid giving anything away, but this was indeed THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ.
B000000LZV|5.0|... and this album changed mine.  I have never heard anything as great as the music that is Double Nickels on the Dime.  If you haven't heard it, then get it.  If you have heard it, then you know words are meaningless in the review of a masterpiece.  Few bands can achieve half of what the Minutemmen achieved on this.  God Bows to Math.
B001KMB6YG|3.0|I didn't think the movie was that bad.  It was sold as an action movie and it delivered. The only real problem for me was the disconnected ending that felt like a chunk was missing.  I understand the \\"raw and uncut\\" dvd release will resolve this problem.  Looking forward to owning it.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This product worked great at first. I thought it was going to be a lifesaver to help me quickly pick up dog hair off of our hardwood floors daily. It did...for the first few months. It doesn't work anymore and I'm going to *try* a replacement battery in the hopes that this solves the problem. It may just be the battery doesn't charge fully anymore.    What it is good for:    Pet hair  Light dirt    What it is bad for:    Dust bunnies (blows them away!)  Bird feathers (same thing)  Larger pieces of dirt such as a spilled houseplant  Throw rugs (get sucked up and unit stops)  Any area that happens to be dirty and damp at the same time.
B00008NRL8|3.0|Gotan Project is electronic music based on a variety of influences, this is not Argentine Tango; do not allow to be fooled by the uneducated like Lung Yam in the essence of Argentine Tango. The two remaining greats of argentine tango Mariano Mores and Horacio Salgan still alive today both semi-retired are the last two great exponents of what tango represents, as an art form. After the passing of the great Astor Piazzolla it has been no indication that a new generation of Argentinean tango composers will carry on with the legacy of the fathers of what is considered the classical music of the twenty century known as the Argentine Tango.  There are few groups today that claim to be Tango Groups among them \\"Gotan Project and Bajofondo Tango Club led by Gustavo Santaolalla\\" they intend to profit under the denomination of Tango by doing so they mislead the consumer with false claims, this groups are just Pop Bands.   Gotan Project and Bajofondo Tango Club had at least made that courageous attempt to profit under the name of Tango.
0765342294|5.0|I bought this book after I watched 'Benders Game', the 3rd Futurama movie. I knew it had nothing to do with the movie but after reading some Wiki I thought it sounded like a good read.<br />  I shouldn't have read so much Wiki about it, almost ruined the book for me, but not quite. It is well written and is a great story. At times I felt like the book was much mor erecent than it is, with the way they descibe the computer networks used, seemed like the internet in the not so distant future. I really liked the ending and will be picking up the next book soon.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the background creation of a villain, the descent from innocence that is portrayed.  The music is catchy and fun, but mirrors the plot so it becomes less so by the end of the Acts.  Overall, well worth watching (again).
B000WGWQG8|4.0|The pace of the series is unusually slow and measured, but the story of Adams' life was so absorbing that I always found myself anxious to watch the next disc in the set.  Giamatti was born to play the part and I particularly enjoyed the contrast between colonial 'grit and dirt' and 'high society' life in eighteenth century America.  Sets, costumes, acting, and script are all top notch.  Puts some blemishes on some of our Founding Fathers, but these revelations seemed factual and not overdone.  The possible exception is the portrayal of Jefferson, but the author's pro-northern bias was, perhaps, an inevitable by-product of his love for the subject.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Experiencing Rush in concert is something that everyone should strive to attain.  Especially for those who truly appreciate a \\"complete\\" show.  Their balance of musicianship, sound quality, lighting, video, pyrotechnics, etc. is masterful.  The video interaction is well timed and not overdone. The lighting design is rich and intriguing and the looks are different for each song.  The sound quality is the best for any live shows I have attended. Pyrotechnics and lasers have just the right impact.  I was fortunate enough to attend both the 2007 and 2008 legs of the Snakes and Arrows Tour.  This 3-Disc DVD collection is an excellent representation of the performance.  The quality of the picture is superior.  The sound pulls you into the performance.  The addition of the concert video footage is fun, from Southpark and the McKenzie Brothers to acting projects from the band.  The song selections give you all of the songs from both legs of the tour across the 3 discs.  The pricing for this collection is an added bonus!  For Rush fans, this collecion is a must!  For everyone else, it is a great concert DVD that may just convert you into a Rush fan!!
B00065MDS6|3.0|Lizard was an album that I purchased in LP form from the used bin at a Lincoln, NE record store for $1.99.  I had gone through my early KC indoctrination (ITCOTCK, , ITWOP, LTIA, Red, and Discipline) and was beginning to branch out.  When I first listened, I regarded it as a pale retread of the first two albums, with Fripp and Sinfield running out of ideas as they drove into a cul-de-sac.  Over the years, I found myself returning to it and listening more carefully.  It is definitely a piece that rewards repeat listenings, especially in the sounds that Fripp was able to coax out of the Mellotron at this point.  In my opinion, this KC album has the most interesting Mellotron sounds of any KC recording, notably so in the Battle of Glass Tears segment of the Lizard suite.  The Mellotron surges through the speakers in a sound that I can only describe as a wavy wash, almost like being buffeted by a storm on the high seas - which is altogether appropriate, since the heat of a battle is being musically depicted.  My only complaint about the CD mix of this album (and hence three stars instead of four) is that Fripp has mixed the vocals down so low in the quiet sections (the beginnings of Cirkus, Prince Rupert Awakes, and Dawn Song) that they are nearly impossible to hear.  This is then followed by the weight of the song kicking in and nearly deafening me, forcing me to turn the volume down - i.e., this mix cannot be listened to comfortably at a consistent volume.  I went back to my old vinyl copy and found that this was not the case for it.  The mix of the different sections is much more fluid and not jarring at all.
B000ROALCG|5.0|I have never really been a Jennifer Lopez fan, which is what initially stopped me from seeing the movie at the movie theatre.  When the movie came out on HBO, I figured I would give it a chance, and I am so glad that I did.  I fell in love with the movie and could not believe the excellent performances by both Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez!!!  I became obsessive with the movie and found myself wanting to hear the music all of the time.  I read some of the reviews in Amazon before I purchased the CD, and the one comment that convinced me to purchase it was that if you like salsa, you will love the CD.      I must say, I could not believe the negative comments that I read and felt that they were really unfair and harsh toward Marc Anthony.  No one can act exactly like someone else without spilling over a bit of their own personality and emotions into a role, however, in this case he made Hector look and sound even better.  He did one hell of a job and deserves a lot of credit. I could not think of anyone else who would have been more appropriate to play the role of Hector LaVoe than Marc Anthony. I think Hector would have been proud.  Marc really gives Hector's music justice and brings so much passion to the screen.  Hector was the salsa King in his day, and Marc Anthony is today's salsa KING!!!!!  Thank you Marc!!
B000VPUIA6|3.0|i got this i seen it for 19.99 and love the beatles but the packing its in looks super cheap   not worth 150 or 250 like they sell in canada at stores but for 19.99 its ok but ever thing falls out looks like they got a kid to put it together  even trying to take the dvds out to watch are a pain in the butt  but the books cards and poster are kool  but not worth theb big price wait till they drop  it to 19.99 again
B001LRJH0U|4.0|I just watched this movie and I must say that I thought it was very good. Excellent acting and just an all around good western and movie. And one thing that I was getting worried about was that it was going to be a 'standard western' using a lot of the same stories and same situations that you have seen over and over and over. Well this movie had enough things that  you wouldn't expect that made it not stale at all and very fresh. Good action but not overwhelmed with it and good drama but not too much dialogue that it got boring in its approx 2 hour length. I was thoroughly satisfied and enjoyed it beginning to end.
0545128285|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Harry Potter series and had hoped this little book would be comparable.  Needless to say, I was disappointed in Rowling's latest offering.<br /><br />The five stories in this book are all short; each imparts a moral lesson.  Although the tales are original, each still manages to sound familiar.  The stories, without the inserted commentary, could have been nice read-a-loud material.<br /><br />However, \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" is gruesome and definitely not suitable for younger muggle children.  \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" might also cause some anxiety, particularly for those young readers/listeners who have not experienced death or do not have a strong spiritual grounding.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the \\"commentary\\" in the text and would like to see Rowling author a wizarding history in the future.  I thought the writing of the commentary was superior to that of the tales.<br /><br />If you have all the Harry Potter books, then you will definitely want to purchase this little volume to complete your collection.  If you're not a Harry Potter fan or don't own all the books, then skip purchasing this book.  You may be disappointed in the actual stories and the commentary will be meaningless.  I rated this book as three stars because it is not a book that will appeal to a large spectrum of readers and because it was not as engrossing as the Harry Potter series.
B00004NJKW|5.0|I love this album, no matter what the critics say, this album is excellent. It's nothing like the first two albums, but almost a new sound. A much toned down, mature sounding album. It may not be their best album of all time, but it sure has the right stuff. What would Oasis be without those guitar solos from Noel? Signature vocals from Liam? They added new faces to the band (Andy & Gem) I find them to be excellent players.    The first track (see track listing) is an interlude featuring excerpts from a movie. If you watched the movie \\"Snatch\\" you might have heard it w/o the excerpts during one the fight scenes. Good guitar work, if you don't mind the f-bomb.     The popular \\"Go Let it Out\\" is one of their best songs, memorable and catchy hooks. \\"Who Feels Love?\\" is sung so well, along with the psychedelic feel and effects. \\"Put Your Money Where Yer Mouth Is\\" is grungy-rock with awesome guitar rifts. \\"Little James\\" (written by Liam) is a simple sweet song with simple lyrics. \\"Gas Panic!\\" sounds like trouble, but \\"gas\\" is never mentioned just \\"panic\\" as in \\"...panic is on the way.\\" The song has the same feel as \\"Who Feels Love?\\" with a psycho screamin' flute playing at the end. \\"I Can See a Liar\\" is another grunge-like song with a tough attitude in the music. \\"Roll it Over\\" is one of the best songs from the album with its psychedelic-feel, melocholic vocals, backing ones as well, and Noel's guitar solo in the middle. Great to conclude the album.    \\"Where did all go wrong?\\" is soft rock with catchy guitar rifts and great lyrics, and \\"Sunday Morning\\" is one my personal favorites, especially for the guitar solo and the overall approach. Both of these songs are performed by Noel, who is one damn good vocalist!    \\"Let's All Make Believe\\" is the bonus track on the import edition, B-side on \\"Go Let it out\\" (which maybe included with the album if you have the right version!) I think this should've been on the original line-up. Another psychedelic-rock song that has the same sort of layout as \\"Go let it out\\" with a fantastic closer! Believe me, if you like this album, you'll like this song as well. Vocals are performed by Liam.     My Faves: Everything, including \\"Let's all make believe\\"    If you like Oasis or alternative rock, this album is worth the listen.

0618680004|4.0|Well, sure, why not add my own review to the 1000+ reviews on Amazon alone, not to mention on-going discussions Dawkins has had with about everybody, friend or foe...<br /><br />So let's jump in. Dawkins does a valuable service, I feel, in poking holes in typical fundamentalism. He also does a great job showing how family, religious figures, and other psychological conditioning inevitably shapes a person's religious views from an early age. His comments on the inconsistencies and anthropomorphisms found in the Bible will be welcome news to many, although these points are old hat to mainstream New Testament scholars (who, it should be mentioned, mostly don't end up in Dawkins' camp even with this awareness). In his religious critiques Dawkins is joined by other prominent scientists who have written extensively on the dangers of religion, such as physicist Victor Stenger, Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg and many others. Atheists love these guys, while the true believers detest them. Unfortunately, we cannot posit intelligence as the deciding factor here, because plenty of highly intelligent people can be found in either camp, or in neither of them (in fact, the smartest position to me seems to be, \\"I have no idea what ultimate truth is, and neither do you\\"). There are many science Nobel Laureates that are sympathetic to a spiritual or downright religious worldview, for example, so prominence in science is no arbitrator in this debate.  This is a point to remember when the debate gets heated and folks begin to talk a little too dogmatic either way.<br /><br />I've observed over the years that the supposed clash between science and religion is much more complex than most people make it out to be. For every argument science can make, the religious folks can tweak their worldview and come up with a solution. We can get as subtle and complex in the arguments as one would like to, and still argue either way. And, it should be mentioned, even non-believers can find some of the purely materialist \\"answers\\" quite unsatisfactory and arbitrary, such as the currently-popular \\"multiverse\\" idea in cosmology. Because religion (and most philosophy, for that matter) is largely a metaphysical worldview, scientific arguments won't make much of a dent in a true believer's religious armor. As other reviewers have noticed here, it is highly unlikely any true believer is going to convert to Dawkins's views after reading this book. And it is also unlikely devout (notice that word) atheists will be won over by arguments the believers put forth. There are many reasons why such debates end up fruitless; I believe one of the main reasons is that people have highly variable \\"thresholds\\" on where they draw the line regarding any importance placed on empirical data. Probably one's conditioning over a lifetime determines a great deal of how much value (or not) one puts on empirical data. People vary quite a bit on that- witness the reviews here on this book.<br /><br />The book does have weaknesses; Dawkins is no expert on religion or theology, nor particularly informed on areas where science (particularly areas in physics) begins to meet with the boundaries of metaphysics. Other scientists with a broader approach have noticed that science is entering an extremely interesting phase of \\"experimental metaphysics\\", where some formerly philosophical areas (strong vs. weak realism, locality, nature of time, role of consciousness, etc) are being looked at, for the first time in history, through EXPERIMENTAL research. One may argue a purely reductionist methodology can handle all this, but that assumption may now be challenged on a number of fronts. Reductionism as a worldview (vs. merely a methodology- an important difference) is getting more and more difficult to justify even from a scientific viewpoint. Exciting times are ahead, as modern experiments continue to push into areas previously only populated by metaphysics. Dawkins's book, however, has a different task-seemingly his goal is simply to bash fundamentalists. On that basis, he succeeds. Considering broader issues, such as our ontological human limitations in constructing science, he needs to lighten up -). I wish it was a surety that evolutionary biology could make categorical judgements on metaphysics, but alas, it cannot.<br /><br />I'm not sure about you, reader, but whenever I read a \\"religious\\" critique from a scientist in the physical or biological fields- without any particular expertise in fields outside their own specialties- I'm never sure they are aware of some possible limitations...It would be nice if the physical or biological sciences prepared somebody to examine areas that lie largely outside the domain of empirical critiques, but this is hardly the case. (And don't forget- just because a field of study has little or no empirical foundation doesn't mean it isn't important to human beings...). Simply put, the physical and biological sciences-by themselves- don't adequately prepare a researcher to form fruitful insights about human spiritual activity in general. A biologist or physicist may be as inadequate as anyone else in evaluating religion and mythology, other than in areas that specifically impinge on their own specialty. Folks should ponder the following quote from physicist-extraordinaire Richard Feynman: \\"I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy\\".<br /><br />As a case in point, we realize Dawkins's specialty is evolutionary biology, so we naturally look for a sharp critique of religious views that reject biological evolution- and clearly Dawkins is in his element here. Any religious view that rejects what modern biology, paleontology, etc. teaches us, can hardly be called \\"scientific\\". However, there are myriads out in TV land who would consider themselves \\"spiritual\\" in some sense (even if not conventional), who accept modern evolutionary biology as a matter of course... For these folks, there is no point in talking about a \\"conflict\\". It is not clear what Dawkins's contribution to their worldview could be, since his main evolutionary arguments are fairly irrelevant to this audience. As for the rest of his message, i.e., the sweeping anti-religion appeals, folks in this latter crowd probably recognize the rants as a personal reaction on Dawkins's part. Clearly, Dawkins considers himself an evangelist for atheism. As for myself, any kind of intense evangelism, regardless if pro or con, arouses MY suspicions. I'm always leery of someone having strong views on topics where strong views are not really justified.  Whatever your stance is on a particular metaphysics - and even if you think a stance is in error- it's all arbitrary. Pro or con- there's no way it couldn't be anything BUT arbitrary...<br /><br />Personally, even though I think guys like Dawkins, Weinberg and Co. do a good job debunking certain biblical hyper-literalists, there remains much that the scientific method cannot directly comment on. Over-confidence in metaphysical critiques isn't wise. Personally again, when I read much of this anti-spiritual material from current scientists, I begin to lament the lack of cultural and philosophical depth that was exhibited by some of the pioneers in science in this century, such as Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Einstein, Pauli, Schrodinger and many others. These pioneers came out of a grand cultural and philosophical background, and it shows in their elaborations on areas outside of science proper. I just think a lot of that is missing in today's polemics against \\"spirituality\\". Heisenberg, for example, wrote of the need for fresh examination of old religious and philosophical ideas, which were perhaps poorly framed, and see if anything fruitful could be extracted and recast into modern terms. Now that is a reasonableness I would like to see more of. Dawkins ain't our guy for that.imply to bash fundamentalists. On that basis, he succeeds.

0316017922|5.0|I have a hard time understanding the snippy, negative reviews given for this book. It was fascinating----and a must read for anyone who wants to give children the best chance of success in life.     It doesn't actually give you a formula for success; what it does is give a window into the circumstances that have made others successful---and I think you will be very surprised at what you see.    I highly recommend this book!
0441013597|5.0|The level of detail in the universe created here by Herbert is astounding.     Great story of politics, murder, mayhem and betrayal all set with an exotic backdrop. Try reading this and not thinking of how oil is used in our world.    Futher chapters in the series have diminishing returns, but the first 3 books are worth reading.    I have read the first book at least 4 times in my life and will probably do so again.
031606792X|5.0|The fourth book in the saga was the best one!  Bella finaly is changed into a vampire they are married and it was just the best they got to acctually spend the whole book together Edaward and Bella and i loved it. I just wish there was more! If you want to know what was in the book your going to have to read it and if you havent read the first three you should they are great i highly recomend them to any one
B0015D3YQI|5.0|PHENOMENA is also known as [[ASIN:B000W90JNC CREEPERS]], except CREEPERS is the cut version of the film. PHENOMENA is the original, uncut version of the film directed by Horror legend Dario Argento (SUSPIRIA, MOTHER OF TEARS, etc.). It's basically about a girl named Jennifer (played by a young Jennifer Connelly) who is sent to a boarding school in Germany while her father is filming a movie in the Phillipines. While there, a bunch of murders take place involving young girls, some of whom are her schoolmates. Turns out she has the ability to communicate with insects and she utilizes her weird talent to help track down the killer, thus leading her to something truly evil and disturbing.<br /><br />There were two things that made me love this movie: the beautiful cinematography and the music. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous, especially for a Horror movie. Dario Argento is known for using color schemes in his films (SUSPIRIA and INFERNO are two that come to mind) and PHENOMENA is no different. A lot of whites and blues and greens are used early on in the film to create a calm, dream-like atmosphere, and then as the film draws to a conclusion, a lot of reds are used to create a nightmarish setting. The visuals in this film are just awesome. The music is also great. It's total synth-heavy 80's style music with even some Heavy Metal thrown in (Iron Maiden's \\"Flash of the Blade\\" is used prominently in the film as the killer's unofficial theme song). I also liked this movie for a lot of other reasons. Jennifer Connelly being one of them. I've always been a big fan of hers and it's cool to see her early on in her career in a film like this. When most people think of young Jennifer, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA and especially LABYRINTH come to mind and this Horror film is often overlooked. Donald Pleasance stars in the film as a wheelchair-bound man who studies insects who is sort of a mentor to Jennifer.<br /><br />As far as the story, it's just crazy. It's a Giallo style killer movie with supernatural elements thrown in. Without spoiling anything, let me just describe the ending. Basically, it's one of the craziest endings I've ever seen in a movie. There's a homicidal deformed little boy, a straight-razor wielding chimpanzee, a giant swarm of bees, a disgusting pit of corpses and maggots, a scene similar to the ending of the first [[ASIN:B001K9OXDU FRIDAY THE 13TH]] movie (remember young Jason jumping out of the lake?), a decapitation, and numerous false endings. And that's only in the last ten or fifteen minutes!<br /><br />I highly recommend PHENOMENA. It's just a good, old school Horror film with a lot of good, cheesy 80's music, a lot of cool visuals, and some pretty gruesome scenes. It even has some unintentionally funny dialogue and overdubs (it's an Italian movie... they filmed it in English but they still overdubbed the voices for some reason). I'm still exploring Dario Argento's filmography, but I have yet to come across a bad one and PHENOMENA is definitely my favorite so far.<br /><br />4.5 starsovie with supernatural elements thrown in.

B000A59PMO|5.0|It was deemed a little bit of \\"Buffy\\" and maybe because of that this series' never got the chance to be as good as [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)]] but with that being said, this series' is one of the few television series' to leave me on the edge of my seat and Buffy was the first series' to do that to me.  Kristen Bell enbodies Veronica Mars a girl like Buffy Summers was once a popular girl in high school but because of circumstances out of her control.  In Buffy's case becoming The Slayer.  In Veronica's case however, it is being the daughter of the man who led a witch against Jake Kane the equivelent of Steve Jobs (owner of Apple Computer) in the series' whose daughter Lily Kane was murdered in cold blood who also happened to be Veronica's best friend and older brother of her lover Duncan Kane.  One thing that can be said, about the series' is that there are plot twists that you do not see coming.  Characters who may appear the stereotypes of high school but they are not.  This is not your typical \\"teen series\\" like out of her own father's mouth she's 17 going on 40.  Veronica is very self aware about who she was before her best friend Lily passed away and who she is now.  She realizes the only reason she was ever popular was her relationship with the Kanes.  I think that only makes her so different than Buffy Summers who never knew where she fit; Veronica knows exactly who she is now.  This is not your typical \\"genre\\" series' either.  I couldn't tell you one episode from the other because all of Season One feels like one huge film.  However, The creator of the series' Rob Thomas does a very good job wrapping up the storylines so when one does get to the last episode of the season, it feels like there is no need for Season Two even though there is one.
031606792X|2.0|In my opinion, this book could have been a few chapters. It was almost like an extended epilogue - everybody ends up together and is happy. But the original theme of Twilight is completely gone.     I have many problems with this book. First, Bella is 18! Eighteen people! I don't care how \\"mature\\" she is - you have no clue what you want when you're 18. She gets married for heaven sakes! And don't even get me started on the whole sex scene business. The idea of an eighteen year old on her honeymoon, running around naked or wearing lingerie, is just downright creepy. Oh right, and her sister-in-law, Alice, packed it for her.     But, it seems that maybe you could get past the wedding part if the rest of the book was good. Yet it only gets worse. First, Bella gets pregnant. Never mind that we can't really understand the logistics of that, she's pregnant with a half-human/half-vampire baby. It starts to get a little too sci-fi for me here. The baby is almost alien-like. She grows and ages quickly and is slowly killing Bella because she (the baby) is so strong. In the \\"birth\\" scene, the baby breaks Bella's spine. Yeah, it's a little disturbing.    And, it just keeps getting worse. Bella drinking human blood while pregnant? Edward and Rosalie having to cut the baby out of her? It just gets more and more like a horror-movie....    And finally, after 400 pages of that ordeal, Bella becomes a vampire. What's weird is that despite the fact that I wanted Bella and Edward to be together, I hoped the series would end with Bella staying human. Once Bella is a vampire, her relationship with Edward changes. The main theme of Twilight is the impossibility of Bella and Edward's love. Once that barrier is removed, the story really loses something.      So, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers here. If you want to read anything out of the Twilight saga, I would definitely recommend Twilight. The next two are pretty good, and for the most part, keep with the original theme.But the fourth one was just too off-the-wall for me. I think if Meyer had wanted to write this book, she should have set it five years into the future or something. It might have made it more plausible. I don't care who or what your husband is, I can't get on board with teenage marriage.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|Based on the reviews here and elsewhere, it seems that I am nearly alone in disliking this film. To give you a context for my remarks, know that I love movies, almost without regard to genre. A good movie stands on its own merits. I liked Batman Begins quite a lot, and I loved Iron Man.<br /><br />What really knocks the wind out of THE DARK KNIGHT is that at 2 ½ hours, it's about 1 ½ hours too long. It's serious all the time but not in a gripping, edge-of-your-seat way. I loved the Operation Skyhook scene and only one other that I can't now recall. The rest was plodding and predictable. Yes, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was inspired, but I think he was on-screen way too much.<br /><br />As always, Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain are wonderful, and I like Gary Oldman, although he's only around briefly. Aaron Eckhart is good as Harvey Dent, but his turn as Two Face was short and confusing. Maggie Gyllenhaal was just blah, and Christian Bale was just there.<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled by the wonderfulness that is Iron Man, but THE DARK KNIGHT kept me looking at my watch.

0316010669|5.0|Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.com    Gladwell is able to take complex situations and reduce them to ideas and concepts that cut through the complexity to reveal an incredibly simple structure.  And, it's that structure that becomes the focus for not only wading through but ultimately being able to understand what's \\"really\\" going on.    He revealed that ability with his first book, The Tipping Point and carried it through in writing blink.    In trying to understand what blink is about Gladwell explains it best:    \\"It's a book about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye.  When you meet someone for the first time, or walk into a house you are thinking of buying, or read the first few sentences of a book, your mind takes about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions.  Well, Blink is a book about those two seconds, because I think those instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really good.\\"    We're taught early on that the right way to make a decision is to gather as much information as possible and carefully weigh all the pros and cons. But sometimes, there just isn't enough time or information.  Other times there's just too much of it.  Those are the kinds of situations blink is about; situations like war, street shootings and dealing with things that appear to be something they are not.    Gladwell's approach is lucid and satisfying.  His style is conversational and avuncular.    The subject is serious but the read is comfortable and easy.  And, when you finish it you truly will have learned something valuable and useful.    Read blink and I promise you won't be disappointed or sorry you did.

B001FB55LM|4.0|Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a lonely guy.  Carl is a loan officer who is real low on life and down in the dumps because of a break up.  One day Carl heeds the advice of an old friend and goes to a self-help seminar.  The motto \\"Yes is the new no!\\"  If the movie's title is any indicator, you know what happens for the rest of the film.  He says yes to anything and everything, even an extremely generous granny.    Not very often a comedy comes out with a message worth listening to.  \\"Yes Man\\" provides just that and exposes the audience to the powers of positive thinking.  The movie itself is a montage of Carl saying yes to everything; Carl says yes to learning to speak Korean, Carl says yes to costume party invites from his boss, Carl says yes to flying lessons, and yes to a bar fight, which was one of the funniest scenes of Carl's acceptance journey.  Eventually, Carl's yes-ery leads to a new love interest named Allison (Zooey Deschanel) and a promotion at work.  And despite all the positive outcomes, Carl learns that saying yes doesn't always necessarily take you in the right direction.    \\"Yes Man\\" is a lot of fun to watch.  Carrey is on top of his game and is still as funny as always.  To answer any questions:  Yes the movie is funny.  Yes it's worth going to see.  And yes you'll enjoy it.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Here we finally have it, all the Gabriel-era albums in full surround and with a new stereo mix.  They new mixes sound flat out fantastic and give this old music a new lease on life.  While faithful to the original mixes, you'll definitely hear details that you didn't before.  Everything now sounds a lot more open, none of the muffled sound that you sometimes had before.  Trespass in particular really benefits from the new treatment.  The DVD extras include interviews around each album, and most the the available video of the early lineup (such as the famous Shepperton Studio footage).  Highly recommended.
0375826726|5.0|Like his book's hero, Paolini is getting better as time passes and his experience grows. The author cannot resist showing his improved skills by enhancing the role of characters, other than Erragon, through interesting episodes in the story. All Erragon's \\"family members\\" (Roran, the dwarf King Orinn, Murtagh)are given a vibrant roles in the story. As it turns out, I won't be surprised if Nasuada(or even Angela for that matter) is his sister by some strange coincidence.   This plethora of heroes, of course, has the result of a more \\"worldly\\" world, where Dragons and Dragon riders do not dominate the reader's imagination. Nevertheless, Paolini gives the author a great read and a more in depth look into Algaesia and its people.   The disturbing twist in the third part of the trilogy is the \\"disorientating\\" change of the \\"rules\\". I was under the impression that a dragon would peril as soon as its rider was killed. This notion is differentiated and consequently altered in this third book. This \\"change\\", alters the rules of the world as described by the author and causes the absorbed and meticulous reader to get disturbed. While (as a reader) you are trying to submerge yourself in the fantasy world of a book, changes like this, result in oozing you out of that world and become an observer instead of a participant. Another change, albeit not a bad one, is that the trilogy is now a series. So, instead of seeing the end of the story, the book ends just when the war begins. Although stories should have an end and not drag for too long, this particular change will result in reading an older, more mature and wiser Paolini, one that would (perhaps) be able to help Erragon find an appropriate solution and a fortunate closure for all Erragon's unavoidable pledges and rash or even reckless promises.   Overall, I liked this book a lot and (although I could never think of myself reading \\"children\\"/fantasy books) I believe I will be waiting for the forth book of the series.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Death Race is death to the finish car race in the prison system. Action is great...I am not going to get into the movie in my review ...This is a must see movie with this regular DVD looking like High Def with great color saturation.
B00197YZ7M|3.0|Okay, so my wife told me that this movie was beyond boring, but since our taste is so different (and I make it a point to see everything related to Oscar in any way) I decided to check this movie out regardless of her feelings.  I can see why she said it was boring.  I personally didn't find it boring (I have my complaints, don't worry), but I understand why she would say that.  Eastwood tried very hard to create a romantic tone to the film, so unless you are drawn to long scenes of two people dancing then you may find yourself; bored.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Francesca, a middle-aged Italian housewife living in Madison County.  When her husband and children are away at the Illinois State Fair she meets and falls in love with a photographer by the name of Robert Kincaid.  They have a four day love affair that ends far too quickly (for them) and then they go their separate ways.  This story is told in flashbacks as Francesca's two children, Carolyn and Michael, read her diary shortly after her death.<br /><br />So, ready for my take on this?<br /><br />I want to start by saying to anyone who may have an issue with this; I rarely ever review a DVD, but always review a film.  I don't personally care about extras, I care about the movie.  Be realistic, how much time are you going to spend watching a films extra's compared to the film itself, and if the film is not worth buying, are the extra's going to change your mind?  So, if you want to know about the bonus features then read another review, but there is no need to click `negative' at the bottom of mine just because I didn't explain all that can be found in the video commentary.<br /><br />So, here's my take...<br /><br />I am not a rationalist when it comes to movies; at least not as much as some are.  I can totally buy the whole `love at fist sight' bit because it's that suspension of belief that makes movie watching so exciting.  If you take everything so literally and seriously then you lose a lot of the joy that comes from movies.  That said, I found some of `The Bridges of Madison County' to be a stretch.  The ending really did it for me, kind of fell to pieces a bit.  I also don't buy Clint Eastwood as a leading man, at all.  I think the casting choice (I know he directed, and he probably wanted to get close with Streep, but seriously, this was a bad move) was way off.  They were originally going to go with Redford.  I'm not a fan of his too much, but at least it would have been more believable.  It's hard to invest yourself in the love story when Francesca's attraction to Robert doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />He's not even all that interesting, really.<br /><br />I also didn't like the idea of having her children read the diary, addressed to them mind you.  It didn't make much sense to me.  You see, in order for it to be necessary that her children know about the affair it should be groundbreaking for them.  I know that the film tries to make it seem that way (with the children's decisions regarding their mates afterward) but it rested uneasy with me.  I didn't see any need whatsoever to inform your children that you were unfaithful to a man who loved you and treated you with respect and dignity.  It would have been different if Francesca's husband was a mean man or a tyrant but he was kind and gentle and caring.  To make your children aware of you actions is somewhat hurtful in my opinion.  That is something you take to your grave, and leave buried.<br /><br />This isn't a review on my opinions on adultery at all, so don't take it as one.  Sure, I believe that adultery is wrong, but I understand that human imperfection causes us to act in ways that are contrary to our own beliefs at times, and we can be taken over by impure lust and moved to do some crazy things (but with Eastwood?) but there is a moral high ground regarding your children that I think any good parent would want to keep, and telling them of your hurtful actions can scar them, permanently.<br /><br />I also found the actors who portrayed the children and their clich&eacute;d reactions to the diary to be rather mediocre and I would have preferred they were not there.<br /><br />The scenes with Streep and Eastwood, and the love affair that develops, is sweet when you look at it apart from the adultery aspect.  It is romantic; Eastwood (the director) makes sure of that.  Both Eastwood and Streep act circles around each other, Streep especially pulling out another Oscar worthy performance.  She is the queen of the accent and she makes them seem effortless.  She has such command over her character, and that scene in the car with her husband, the hand clenching the door handle, just marvelous acting (heartbreaking too).  So don't get me wrong here, there is something to like about this movie, and the story that develops is endearing (I never found it boring).  I just wish that it had been handled a little better in parts.  Cast another leading man and clean up the way in which the story is told (no need for flashbacks, the film is powerful enough without them) and it could have been a five star movie.  Instead I give it a high C, thanks to Streep and her unfathomable talent.and their clichéd reactions to the diary to be rather mediocre and I would have preferred they were not there.

B000MV8AE0|5.0|This film truly defines quality melodrama (the promoters call it \\"drama\\")... the emotions of the principals herein are somewhat exaggerated and a superb soundtrack punctuates the action. The various scenes flow right along and are neither hokey, nor boring, nor lethargic.<br /><br />Here we are transported to 1825 Vienna, Austria near the end of Beethoven's life. There is not much argument against Beethoven being the greatest classical music composer of all time and his groundbreaking Magnum opus, Symphony No. 9 (\\"Choral\\") serves as the focal point of the film. It's also significant to know that Beethoven was deaf, pretty much subsequent to the composition of his 5th Symphony.<br /><br />A fact of which most casual Beethoven listeners are unaware is that the old maestro could be a brutal megalomaniac just short in increment of Richard Wagner's infamous personality. But at times Beethoven could also assert compassion, especially toward his closest relative, a ne'er-do-well nephew.<br /><br />The story here is about a young music student, Anna Holz (superbly played by Diane Kruger), who is tasked to hurriedly copy the score of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the premi&egrave;re of which is slated for just a few days away. She \\"corrects\\" Beethoven's scrawl (Beethoven is played quite effectively by Ed Harris) in one critical spot and this incomprehensible but courageous act brings the two of them together into a \\"partnership\\" rather than as employer-employee.<br /><br />Beethoven insists on conducting the 9th and, in a near panic, on the night of the concert he enlists Anna to conduct in the pit just below him so that he doesn't throw the orchestra off into chaos. One of the finest facets of the movie is the shrewdly abridged version of the 9th Symphony being conducted by Beethoven (and by Anna). The interaction between Anna and Beethoven presents a roller coaster ride that the viewer will not soon forget.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of contemporary film -- rare exceptions include [[ASIN:B00064LJVE The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)]] and [[ASIN:B00005JKNF Gosford Park]]. But in this instance I have found yet another exception -- this is a terrifically entertaining film from start to finish. And of course the filmscore is spectacular as well, particularly for Beethoven fans. I do wish that I had viewed the movie in widescreen but this is the hazard of borrowing DVDs from the public library -- they tend to always be in full-screen.<br /><br />The film is not entirely flawless in that it's hardly a work for the edification of prospective Beethoven scholars. For example, Beethoven at one point states his guess that Anna's favorite of all his works is the \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" (Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor \\"Quasi una fantasia\\", Op. 27, No. 2, composed in 1801.) This unfortunate comment is an anachronism as this renowned work wasn't dubbed the \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" until 1832, when music critic Ludwig Rellstab compared the first movement to moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne. The point is that this nickname did not evolve until five years subsequent to Beethoven's death in 1827.<br /><br />Still, I'm okay with the invocation of poetic license on the part of directors of biographical films as long as it's not something in gross conflict with the life of their selected subject. In this case, the movie was wonderfully directed by Agnieszka Holland.<br /><br />Highly recommended!een Vista Series)]] and [[ASIN:B00005JKNF Gosford Park]].

No, frankly it doesn't, but it you saw the movie \\"The Remains Of The Day,\\" you might change your mind. Then, you might check out this book. Yeah, be warned that it is slow but I enjoyed every page.    Since this book is in the form of a narrative, I think it helped to see the movie first. That way, I can picture Anthony Hopkins telling me the story of himself - \\"Stevens\\"-  and it makes the book more real.  Even though he goes into great detail explaining what makes a perfect butler and how he works to attain that status, I find all of it oddly fascinating. Kudos for author Kazuo Ishiguro for taking what could be a dry subject and making it entertaining.    Of course, there is a lot more story than just the butler's duties, and all of that - politics, romance, etc. - is even more fascinating.  You can read the story's details elsewhere here, so I won't bore you with it here. Just believe me when I say that if you loved the movie, and you enjoy a good \\"character study,\\" you will love the book.      \\"Stevens\\" is somebody you won't soon forget.

B000ICLRIE|1.0|Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.    The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale.

1439102813|5.0|Alice Howland, a professor at Harvard University, is about to receive some devastating news. Her pangs of forgetfulness are a little more serious than she thought, because she has a disease that's incurable. She has a disease that's only going to get worse over time.    At the age of 50, she has Alzheimer's Disease.    And although she starts forgetting things that are relatively insignificant, her disease progresses... ultimately leading up to the novel's crushing conclusion.    Lisa Genova's debut novel is a very impressive piece of work. It's devastating. It's humorous. Every single character is relatable, even at their worst. It's everything a novel should be. And seeing as the author herself is a Harvard professor with a Ph.D. in neuroscience, there's a distinct feeling that she knows what she's talking about. We \\"see\\" the story from Alice's point of view. We get in her mind... we experience what she's experiencing.     And although it didn't really end the way I wanted it to, it felt very realistic nonetheless. It didn't fall into any of the obvious cliches it could have fallen into. The novel stayed true to itself--and to Alice--until the very end.    I definitely recommend this novel, and I'll be on the lookout for Lisa Genova in the future.

I was disappointed the DVD lyrics didn't look as artistic on our set (720p 16:9)...they were raggedy in fact and set rather high on the screen. So after this viewing of the DVD, we'll probably see the version without the song lyrics. Look forward to seeing the special feature on this disk and looking up what is on the 2-disc version. Was also nice to see the deleted song...I wracked my brain trying to figure out where that song came from when I downloaded the mp3 album.

B0009YNRZM|5.0|Frank Zappa released around 60 albums during his career spanning almost 3 decades.  Certainly no one album that comes close to capturing the full scope of his vast and incredibly diverse output.  I put together a \\"starter list\\".  It is admittedly incomplete and somewhat arbitrary.  One album that unequivocally is a must-have for any Zappa collection is \\"We're Only In It For the Money\\".  It's definitely one of his masterpieces.<br /><br />The album is like \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"'s sinister cousin.  The title might bring chuckles these days, but back in the day it was a slap in the face of the idealistic mindset of the 60's.  From the album cover, to the lyrical content, down to the last fading note, it is a biting commentary of the times (1967-68), which takes equal swipes at the foolishness of the counterculture (`Who Needs the Peace Corp\\") and the hypocrisy, materialism and violence of the \\"establishment\\" mainstream culture (`Mom & Dad)\\".  The album mixes short, almost childish sounding, songs with Musique Concrete, and spoken -word segments with bizarre treatments and jarring edits, resulting in a truly disturbing, surrealist collage.  The tracks all run into each other, and there is a strongly cohesive feel to the whole work.  Most of the vocals are speeded up and given other treatments, to augment the surreal, absurdist effect.  There are deliberately jarring edits where the music jumps to a completely different style, and even include the sound of a stylus being dragged across an LP (what's funny is that even when listening to the CD it occasionally startles me ').<br /><br />The songs often sound bubblegumm-ish at first listed (the speeded up vocals increase the effect), but further investigation shows that these are actually quite sophisticated.  Several songs, including \\"Idiot Bastard Son\\" (see YCDTOSA Vol. 2), \\"Harry You're A Beast\\", were subsequently played by later versions of Zappa's band in instrumental versions, or with greatly modified arrangements, and these demonstrate the sophistication and quality of the compositions.<br /><br />The second half (former side 2 of the LP version) begin and end with abstract Musique Concrete sound collages, which are often disparaged by reviewers.  I would argue that they are critical components of the whole, which contribute to the overall feel of the album.  Listen for Eric Clapton's spoken-word cameo in \\"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\\".  The final track, \\"Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny\\" (In the liner notes you are instructed to read Kafka before proceeding to listen), is truly disturbing.  The piece closes with a banging piano note with a long fade out, heavily distorted through filters, which is the root of the piano chord at the end of \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\".<br /><br />The album was recorded basically at the same time as [[ASIN:B0000009RZ Lumpy Gravy]].  The two covers actually reference each other by name, and there is a lot of what would come to be known as \\"Conceptual Continuity Clues\\".  An instrumental version of \\"Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance\\" is the closing theme of \\"Lumpy Gravy\\".<br /><br />A note about the various versions of the album:  According to Zappa himself, when he went back to re-master the album for CD (it had been out of print for over a decade, and the original label, MGM, had gone belly-up), he found that the master tapes had degraded to the point where some tracks (drums and bass mostly) were unusable.  For the first  CD version, he re-recorded some of the bass and drum parts, and remixed parts - unscrambling some censored lyrics on \\"Harry You're a Beast\\" and \\"Mother People\\".  The result for people who had known and loved the original was jarring and definitely inferior.  Luckily Zappa lived long enough to see the error of his ways and corrected it in later releases.  Sadly he didn't correct similar mistakes on other albums, most notably \\"Ruben and the Jets\\", but also \\"Hot Rats\\", \\"Weasels Ripped My Flesh\\" and \\"Uncle Meat (see my review).  \\"Ruben\\" is essentially ruined - look for used LP versions -, but the issues with the other ones are minor.<br /><br />Resist the temptation to buy the early \\"two-fer\\" edition which couples \\"WOIFTM\\" with \\"Lumpy Gravy\\".  Look for more recent versions.<br /><br />If you have any interest at all in Zappa's music, you must hear this one!<br /><br />If you're interested, please see my \\"Zappa starter list\\" on my profile.ersions -, but the issues with the other ones are minor.

1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is an outstanding novel that is both uplifting and heart wrenching.  I find it unbelievable that this is Genova's first novel.  The book commands your attention from the first page all the way through to the conclusion (I read 2/3 of it while biking at the gym without even looking up from the page).  The character Alice and her family come to life and the narration gives the reader such an intriguing first person perspective of Alzheimer's disease.  This has been, without a doubt, the best book I have had the pleasure of reviewing over the past many months.  Highly highly recommended!
0780619951|5.0|Personally, I like this movie. It's creepy and it also entertains the viewer. I thought that character played by Marlon Brando was just perfect. Remember, he was going through a tough time while making this movie.<br /><br />Sadly, most people ignore this great movie and cast it aside. But not me. I think if you are looking for a entertaining and creepy movie, then this is just for you. My addvice, buy this DVD. It's cheap and it is worth it all the way.
0670020745|3.0|My Stroke of Insight is a first person account of a neuroscientist's left hemisphere stroke.  The opening chapters of the book are devoted to initiating the non-scientist reader into the basics of brain science so that they may fully appreciate the proceeding story. I found the introductory chapters and the narrative to be entertaining and interesting although together they only constituted roughly half of the book.<br /><br />The following half quickly changed gears into more of a \\"self-help\\" book about finding your inner peace, being one with the universe and the like.  Truthfully, after reading this book I would be hard pressed to shelf it as either medical lit. or science.  Instead, I would probably put it over in the new age / self-help category.<br /><br />Notwithstanding, its a well written book. I find the first half entertaining but, I don't entirely buy it.  My education is in both psychology and chemistry and I find it hard to believe that this first-person minute-by-minute account of her experiencing the stroke is completely accurate.  However, I do acknowledge that the book is insightful and could be a real inspiration for stroke survivors, their families and loved ones.

0395860210|3.0|The characterization in this book is admirable, but it flounders in the plot and narrative departments.  Much time is spent in pondering ontological and deterministic questions, as well as explaining in great detail the intricacies of glove-making.  Roth dwells on the emotional inner torment of his characters to an almost maudlin degree.<br /><br />  It's not a terrible book by any stretch, but I have a difficult time believing there was none better in 1998, and it certainly isn't among his strongest.  Anyone disappointed by this novel should try Ghost Writer, which is more compact and substantial, without so much self-indulgence in suburban philosophy.  Roth is still a great writer here, it simply feels as if he begins coasting near the halfway point, and the book floats on from there to its stultifying conclusion.
1416562605|4.0|This book is a bit unusual but worth it.  It is very intriguing.  It portrays a view of India that may seem angry.  Other than the relevance to the history, culture, and politics of modern day India, there are some interesting themes of the mind of a servant and the motives and rationale for murder.  It was a memorable experience.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|My favorite movie that was created by Pixar was Finding Nemo. Not too far behind is WALL-E. This was a very cute movie and at times, you can't help but shed a tear ( I'm not afraid to admit it!).<br /><br />WALL-E basically takes place in the distant future when Earth is nothing more than a waste land covered in nothing more than, waste! You can't help but notice that more than 45 minutes into the movie, you see no humans. It's not until WALL-E, a robot trash compactor, stowaways on a ship destined for a space cruise ship. When we see humans on the space cruise ship, we learn that anyone left alive are on this huge luxary cruise ship light years into space. All humans are rather portly and tended to their every needs by robots. The robot co-pilot has a striking resemblance to the robot from the spaceship in the Disney movie, Flight of the Navigator ( Was this Disney and Pixar's last work together; then that will explain it).<br /><br />Back to the movie! WALL-E is a trash compactor sent by the company BNL to earth to clean it up. All during his shift, WALL-E collects items that he believes are either collectibles or something he can use to fix himself. He \\"lives\\" in a rundown type of a trailer. WALL-E has  VCR tape (yeah, can you believe it??) and watches a really old film (taking into consideration of what the time period was in the movie). Surprisingly, it's an old dancing film with a little bit of love mixed in. WALL-E mimicks the dancing to the best of his ability and then \\"learns\\" about hand holding.<br /><br />Later on in the movie, we meet E.V.E, a more advanced robot on a classified mission on Earth. She hovers, has  a hovering head, and a laser from her right hand that would make all men evacuate the area :) WALL-E is intrigued by her presence and remember the old movie. He tried to befriend EVE and find out why she is here. When EVE finds a plant, she puts it in her body cavity and \\"hibernates.\\" All this time, WALL-E protects her and tries to wake her up. WHen it was raining it was cute how he held up the umbrella to keep EVE dry and  gets struck by lightning twice<br /><br />WALL-E tries to follow EVE when the spaceship comes to pick EVE up. EVE's true reason for coming to earth is revealed later in the movie ( I don't want to give it away for those who haven't seen the movie). Will WALL-E find love with EVE? Would EVE also learn about love? It was cute when WALL-E got into trouble in one part and EVE bellows, \\"WAAAALLLLEEEEEEEE!\\" This was a cute movie and most kids will just see it as a movie unless parents teach about the environmental issues that are \\"subtly\\" in this animated film.<br /><br />The packaging (casing) is horrendous. Probably the most horrendous that I've ever encountered. A few papers in there create such a mess and the DVD only sits in what amounts to an area that was cut out to fit a DVD. It's like making a meatball hero and when you want to fit the meatballs in the hero, you dig out the bread in the middle so the meatballs fit inside easily. Great analogy, right?<br /><br />The movie was cute, warm, and had a great message about life, love, and environmentalism. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was going to shed a tear when WALL-E almost died twice. Another happily ever after ending from Pixar! They should work on better packaging of the film however.was cute how he held up the umbrella to keep EVE dry and  gets struck by lightning twice    WALL-E tries to follow EVE when the spaceship comes to pick EVE up.

I only gave the book four out of five stars because while it was very good...I'm reminded how much I miss anticipating the next HP release.  Wonderful series...and like the wizard of oz..christians do not need to fear HP.  It is far more about good vs evil and the value of true friendship than \\"satan worship\\"  Although the Hairy Heart might be rated PG-13 I enjoyed my quick trip back into HP world.

B00005Q4CS|2.0|There is a lot of aesthetically pleasing and artistic camera and story work in this movie, but ultimately it comes off as an R-rated after-school special.       It's not a matter of not liking sad stories.  There are plenty of tragic tales that peak everyone's interest (Shakespeare anybody?) but this one has such a blunt-force trauma aspect that it's difficult to take it seriously.  It says, \\"here are some people who do drugs and every conceivable absolutely horrid thing that can happen to them amplified.\\"    Perhaps the DVD cover should read, \\"Abandon all hope, ye who enter.\\"
B0018Q4BTQ|5.0|Brad Paisley outdid his reputation on this album!  There are four incredible songs, and the rest are fantastic surprises.  For those of you who enjoy Brad's funnier side, there are two great songs:  Ticks, and Online.  For those that enjoy his writing ability, you have two amazing songs in:  Letter To Me, and Waiting On A Woman.    You will be shocked that the other songs on this album did not make it onto the radio.  This guy is ridiculously talented, and might have 5 or 6 future classics on this album alone.    This would make a great Christmas gift!  Enjoy!
0575081406|5.0|Rothfuss's writing is so witty and eloquent the pages fly by. He gives a new spin to the classic tale of heroes and dragons. Really, there's not enough praise in the universe to describe his tome of extreme excellence and sheer kicka$$ery!<br /> So, I'll give you a few examples of its appeal:<br /><br />1. I have never been able to pick a favorite book before. Now I'm possessed by the demon of Patrick Rothfuss fandom every time someone asks. I should probably cut back on that, though. My family is getting the \\"It's time to call the exorcist\\" gleam in their eyes. But fear not, holy water could never destroy my love of \\"Name of the Wind\\"!<br /><br />2. I read NOTW a year ago before passing it along to my friends. I still haven't gotten it back and all my friends loved it!<br /><br /> In the interest of full disclosure, some may think that the book moves slowly. I completely disagree, but I understand where they are coming from. Rothfuss fleshes out his world completely, realistically, and interestingly. I would listen to a description of dirt if this man wrote it.<br /><br />Honestly, just go buy it.<br /><br />*waves hands* shoo!

0316017922|5.0|If it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become a master, as Malcolm Gladwell suggests in his latest book \\"Outliers, The Story of Success\\", he himself, has become one.  With this third addition to his influential set which includes his original masterpiece, \\"The Tipping Point\\", Gladwell has shown us once again, that the rudimentary skills of good writing require only observation and simplicity.  He has risen to be perhaps this country's foremost journalistic story teller and \\"Outliers\\" will emerge, it must emerge, as one of the most important stories of our century.<br /><br />I wish I would have read this book 30 years ago. Even though the theories that Gladwell espouses have been around for some time, no one put them together in such an articulate manner.  And now, Gladwell puts the full weight and credibility of his writing and experience behind these theories and shows us, quite simply, that other forces, simpler forces not complex or sinister ones, are at work creating our modern days marvels--the outliers of society.  These outliers include the Beatles, Bill Gates, and Wayne Gretzky (although he doesn't mention the Great One by name).<br /><br />I struggled with his use of the word outlier throughout his book and in the end, Gladwell admits, that an outlier is perhaps \\"not an outlier at all\\", so unfortunately it is not clear that the title of this book deserves a place in the vernacular, but it is clear the theories contained in \\"Outliers\\" are now here to stay.<br /><br />\\"The Tipping Point\\", described a phenomenon that after careful study emerges from any non-linear behavior and therefore is hard to predict and replicate.  In \\"Blink\\" Gladwell describes yet another phenomenon that emerges as a result of the complexities of instinct and cognition, again, hard to predict and hard to replicate.  What \\"Outliers\\" does differently than these other books is to provide the recipe for success.  Not guaranteed, Bill Gates, style success but in the words Gladwell has given us from the rice fields of Asia, \\"No one who can rise before dawn three hundred and sixty days a year can fail to make his family rich\\". With \\"Outliers\\" there is something we can do, something we can try.  Not just something we can observe.  For that reason, this book will be a classic.fields of Asia, \\"No one who can rise before dawn three hundred and sixty days a year can fail to make his family rich\\".

B00188KD1Y|3.0|I know this is a remake of Paul Bartel's cult classic \\"Death Race 2000\\" from 1975, but Paul W.S. Anderson's \\"Death Race\\" (2008) looks more like a cross between Mel Gibson's \\"Mad Max 2\\" and Arnold Schwarzenegger's \\"The Running Man.\\" With lots of actions and plot holes, \\"Death Race\\" only wants to entertain us. Though the film still has room for improvement, especially the way it wraps up the story, I liked the film for what it is, pure entertainment.    The time is set in 2012. Jason Statham plays a retired ace racer Jensen Ames, wrongly accused of murder. He is sent to \\"Terminal Island,\\" the worst kind of jail controlled by a cold-blooded, money-hungry warden Hennessey (very icy Joan Allen). There, disguised as the star racer \\"Frankenstein,\\" Jensen joins the survival games staged as a hugely popular online show.     Despite its weak (and sometimes very silly) plot, \\"Death Race\\" delivers nice car stunts, some of which are clearly inspired by the climax car chase of \\"Mad Max 2.\\" The racing scenes are the greatest merit of the film, but I think with less hectic pace and erratic editing the racing footage could have been better. On the acting side, Jason Statham turns in a decent performance as the hero and you can enjoy watching (delightfully, I hope) over-the-top acting from Joan Allen, who delivers one of the most memorable lines of the year. Don't miss it.

B00000APLI|5.0|Whereas Kraftwerk navigated the [[ASIN:B000007U6V Autobahn]] at a fairly moderate pace, Alan Vega & Martin Rev often break all speed limits. Controlled, even disembodied vocals characterize the German band's music while Suicide's is pierced by whoops, hollers & gasps. Most of these songs are so beautiful and tuneful that they would have been chart material had they been toned down to the level of say, [[ASIN:B000N4S90G OMD]] or Eurythmics. With the exception of the 10 harrowing minutes of Frankie Teardrop, a real piece of \\"psychobilly,\\" the melodies & hooks are irresistible.<br /><br />The pulsating Ghost Rider with its ominous drone is quite anthemic, more minimalist than Alan Vega's later [[ASIN:B000002MAP solo version]]. Although still appealing, Rocket USA is eerie & doom-laden while Cheree is a mid-tempo ballad with an enchanting chiming melody unfolding behind the drone. There are lighter, more accessible and highly catchy tracks like Johnny and Girl, another slow number with a hypnotic arrangement & richly textured sounds. The remix of Cheree sounds more soulful & romantic than the original. Its chugging rhythms & yearning vocals give I Remember a melancholic air. Then follows Keep Your Dreams, an addictive ditty with a lilting flow.<br /><br />Disc 2 consists of 6 live performances recorded at CBGB's. Mr Ray is a heavy but surprisingly subdued interpretation of the Velvets' [[ASIN:B000002G7E Sister Ray]], Las Vegas Man a musically monotonal but vocally exuberant excursion, and the cover of the 60s pop hit 96 Tears is punctured by crashing sound effects & Vega's yelping. There's a slower and warmer rendition of Keep Your Dreams where the synth sounds like an organ, and a menacing rather than mournful I Remember with some blood-curdling screams and echoing vocals. Sparks fly on the spectacular Harlem with its driving beat where Vega growls & bellows instead of the usual gasping & yelling.<br /><br />The brutal Brussels performance is cacophonic, dissonant and marred by feedback. Tension builds up through the swearing, booing, chanting and scattered clapping, culminating in the dispute over the microphone. It was quite a riot according to the sleeve-notes, making [[ASIN:B0012X6FT4 Elvis Costello]] for whom they opened, even more caustic than he was in those days.<br /><br />The band's sound on this album ranges from a unique type of electronic rockabilly to experimental like one of their Mute label-mate bands, [[ASIN:B000003Z6U The Normal]] (Warm Leatherette & TVOD), to the accessible territory later explored by The Human League, Eurythmics & OMD. The main difference with Kraftwerk is that in unifying man & machine, the German band restrained the emotions while Suicide does just the opposite by using the electronics to amplify emotions to the extreme. On the later CD [[ASIN:B0006IUE70 A Way of Life]], they did take a more pop approach but sacrificed most of the passion.

0156034026|4.0|This short work is hard to put down. I found it rather compelling, well-written, and convincing, in the sense that the narrator's voice seemed sincere. The story of disgruntled Ivy League graduates is going to be very much on everyone's minds now that the First Lady is in the spotlight. Mrs. Obama seems to have her own story to tell about feeling out of place among America's trust fund brats. Be that as it may, Hamid convincingly tells his story of upward mobility at Princeton and then on to Wall Street. Resentment is easily cultivated; this is the story of a fellow who rises quickly, wanting nothing but money and success until he realizes that there is more to life than first-class flights to the ends of the earth. It is not entirely clear whether this is all the Princeton had to teach; what is clear is that this is all that Hamid came to America for. When he sorts it all out, he blames America. Something tells me that this is what he learned at Princeton, since this is more or less all that one hears from writers educated in such places. Still his story is not to be dismissed. The relationship between the Princeton grad from Pakistan and his reluctant girlfriend strikes me as the heart of the story, but this relationship is not nearly as easily sorted out as the politics of the author. He's found himself a deeply disturbed gal who can't get over the death of a previous boyfriend. Just what this means is unclear, but one can't help wondering if the author is trying to wrap a political parable around a soft psychological center.

I'll be brief...<br />- Continuity: the story does not flow. It actually seems like a cheesy B movie with a ton of well dressed extras. I can't exclaim enough how fragmented this film feels in this release. It does not absorb you into the drama or action at all<br />- Audio: The power of the amazing musical score in the original cut is entirely gone. The sound affects overpower the conversation at times and the music seems ill timed, not how I remember it at all.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia! is a stage musical with a book by British playwright Catherine Johnson, based on the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus. It is an example of a jukebox musical, and is notable for popularizing the genre. A common misconception is that the plot is adapted from the 1968 film Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell starring Gina Lollobrigida. (In that film the mother is a former prostitute who told all three men that they were the father to secure payment for her child's upkeep. This differs vastly from the Mamma Mia story. Donna is not based on a prostitute and the writers deny any knowledge of the 1968 film, any similarity is coincidental.)<br /><br />Although the title of the musical is taken from the group's 1975 chart-topper Mamma Mia, the plot is fictional, not biographical.<br /><br />Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, who composed the original music for ABBA, were involved in the development of the show from the beginning. Anni-Frid Lyngstad has been involved financially in the production, while Agnetha F&auml;ltskog has not, though she was present at the Swedish premiere and final show.<br /><br />The musical includes such hits as \\"Super Trouper\\", \\"Dancing Queen\\", \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\", \\"Thank You for the Music\\", \\"Money, Money, Money\\", \\"The Winner Takes It All\\", \\"Voulez Vous\\", \\"I Have a Dream\\" and \\"SOS\\". It had been seen by over ten million people worldwide as of July 2003.[1] Estimates of 2007, is that 30 million have now seen Mamma Mia!. Since its opening in 1999, the production has grossed US$2.0 billion in earnings. [2]<br /><br />A stage-to-film adaptation, Mamma Mia! The Movie, starring Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, premiered in July 2008Mamma Mia! The Movie is a 2008 Golden Globe-nominated stage-to-film adaptation of the 1999 West End musical of the same name, based on the songs of successful pop group ABBA, with additional music also composed by ABBA member Benny Andersson. The film did very well at the box office becoming the most successful Hollywood film musical of all time and the highest grossing film of all time in the United Kingdom.[2] Like the stage musical, the film's title originates from the group's 1975 chart-topper Mamma Mia. It was produced by Universal Pictures in partnership with Playtone and Littlestar.[3]<br /><br />Meryl Streep heads the cast of the film, playing the role of single mother Donna Sheridan. Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgård play the three possible fathers to Donna's daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried).<br /><br />On August 29, 2008, Mamma Mia!: The Sing-Along Edition, with lyrics to the songs highlighted on the screen, was released in select theaters.[4]<br /><br />On December 15, 2008, it was announced that Mamma Mia! had become the highest grossing film in Britain of all time. The previous record was held by Titanic in 1998.The film takes place on the enchanting Greek island of Skopelos (Kalokairi). The story begins at the remote Aegean island hotel, Villa Donna, run by Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), and Sophie's fiance Sky (Dominic Cooper).<br /><br />Prior to her forthcoming marriage, Sophie nervously posts three wedding invitations (\\"I Have a Dream\\") to three different men, one of whom she believes may be her father. From three cities across the globe, three men set off to return to the island, and the woman that had enchanted each of them 20 years earlier.<br /><br />Back on that island, Donna is rousing her staff for the frenetic day ahead as Sophie's bridesmaids and best friends Ali and Lisa (Ashley Lilley and Rachel McDowall) arrive and she shares with her best mates a scandalous secret: Sophie has found her mother's diary and learned she has three possible dads; American businessman Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Swedish adventurer Bill Austin (Stellan Skarsgard), and British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth). Without telling her mother, she has invited all three to her wedding (\\"Honey, Honey\\"), believing that after she spends time with them, she will at last know who her real father is.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back on the Greek mainland, Sam, Bill, and Harry; strangers until today have met at the harbor. Fortuitously, Sam and Harry have missed the ferry to Skopelos (Kalokairi), and Bill offers them a lift on his yacht to reconnect with the woman who broke all their hearts 20 years ago.<br /><br />Back on Skopelos, Donna is ecstatic to reunite with old friends and former \\"Donna and The Dynamos\\" bandmates, wisecracking author Rosie (Julie Walters) and wealthy multiple divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski), and reveals her mystification at her daughter's desire for a traditional wedding or any wedding at all. At the Villa, Sophie introduces Tanya and Rosie to true love Sky, and tells them about their idea of designing a website to attract tourists to the island. Donna explains her precarious finances (\\"Money, Money, Money\\") to her girlfriends as she takes them on a tour of the Villa. Hounded by her creditors, Donna dreams of a \\"rich man's world,\\" sunbathing on a yacht and being deliciously pampered. She is brought back to reality as an ominous crack appears in the courtyard.<br /><br />The three men arrive, and Sophie smuggles them to their quarters and sheepishly explains that she, not her mother, sent the invitations. She begs the men to hide so Donna will have a fantastic surprise at the wedding; seeing the old friends of whom she \\"so often\\" favorably speaks. They overhear Donna working (humming \\"Fernando\\" to herself) in the storeroom below preparing to fix the crack and the men swear to Sophie they will not reveal her secret. Sophie leaves by the window just in the nick of time, as Donna peeps through the trapdoor.<br /><br />She is dumbfounded to find herself face to face with the three former lovers she could never forget (\\"Mamma Mia!\\"), while the men clumsily make up excuses for their presence. Donna is adamant; they simply cannot stay. Visibly shaken, she confides in Tanya and Rosie (\\"Chiquitita\\") a secret she has kept from everyone - she is uncertain which of the three men is actually Sophie's father. No matter, as Tanya and Rosie rally her spirits by getting Donna to join in with the female staff and islanders accompanying a musical number intended to make her forget her woes. Donna and The Dynamos reclaim their glory days and champion the women of the island in a call to liberation (\\"Dancing Queen\\").<br /><br />Sophie finds the men aboard Bill's yacht, and they take a trip around the gorgeous island of Skopelos (\\"Our Last Summer\\") and tell her stories of Donna as a carefree girl. Upon their return, Sophie musters up the courage to speak with Sky about her ploy, but loses her nerve. Sky and Sophie sing passionately to each other (\\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\"), but are interrupted by the bachelor party that has descended upon Sky to kidnap him for his last night of freedom.<br /><br />At Sophie's bachelorette party, Donna, Tanya, and Rosie perform in a surprise one-night-only event as Donna and The Dynamos (\\"Super Trouper\\"). Sophie is delighted to see her mother rock out, but becomes nervous when the festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Sam, Bill and Harry. She decides to get each of her three prospective dads alone to talk.<br /><br />The young bride uses the confusion of her amorous girlfriends' dancing with the men (\\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\\") to speak with Sam about his love for Donna. Next, she's on to Harry about his desire, if any, for children. Finally, Bill reveals that the old woman who gave Donna the money to invest in her Villa was his Great Aunt Sofia, and Sophie guesses she must be her namesake. That's it! Bill must be her father! Sophie asks him to give her away and to keep their secret from Donna until the wedding<br /><br />Over the moon, Sophie returns to the party. But her happiness is short-lived as Sam and Harry each tell her they must be her dad and will give her away (\\"Voulez-Vous\\"). A shocked Sophie can't tell them the truth and, overwhelmed by the consequences of her action, faints on the dance floor.<br /><br />In the morning, Rosie and Tanya reassure a frantic Donna they will take care of the men. Donna confronts Sophie in the courtyard, mistakenly believing Sophie wants the wedding stopped. Sophie angrily says that all she wants is to avoid her mother's mistakes and storms off. An upset Donna is accosted by Sam, full of fatherly concern at Sophie getting married so young. Donna dresses him down, and both realize they still have feelings for each other (\\"SOS\\").<br /><br />Meanwhile, on Bill's boat, Bill and Harry are about to confide in each other, but are interrupted by Rosie who is startled to find Bill, naked, making breakfast. Similarly, pulses are racing down on the sandy beaches as Tanya and young Pepper (Philip Michael) continue their May-December flirtations from the previous night (\\"Does Your Mother Know\\").<br /><br />With her plans falling apart and wedding in jeopardy, Sophie knows it is time to come clean to Sky and ask for his help. He reacts angrily to his fianc&eacute;e's deception and Sophie must turn to her mother for support.<br /><br />As Donna helps her daughter dress for their wedding, the rift is quickly healed and Donna reminisces about Sophie's childhood and how quickly she's grown (\\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\"). Then and there, Sophie decides the only parent she's ever known is the only one who should give her away.

0143039431|5.0|For whatever reason, I started this book several years ago and did not finish it.  I think I was reading too quickly and it did not draw me in.  My daughter had to read it so I got an audio version for a road trip the two of us went on.  The reader nailed it. He read slowly and had far better voices than my own mind conjured up.  After that, I read some chapters at a much slower pace, and what a difference that made.  So, that is all I want to add to what others may have written. Over the top fantastic book.
B000056HE9|5.0|During the Christmas season, Dudley, an angel in the guise of a mortal, strolls around a small town and notices Julia Brougham, the bishop's wife, gazing wistfully through a store window. Dudley follows Julia to a Christmas tree lot, where she meets her old friend, Professor Wutheridge, and expresses her sadness that her husband Henry is too busy worrying about fund raising for a new cathedral to enjoy the season with his parishioners. The professor offers Julia a contribution of an ancient Roman coin from his collection. After Julia leaves for home, Dudley purposely bumps into the professor and makes inquiries about the Broughams. When Julia arrives home, she finds Henry in a tense meeting with several important parishioners, including Mrs. Agnes Hamilton, a wealthy widow, who insists that her large contribution toward the cathedral's construction guarantee a proper memorial to her dead husband. Henry is upset by Julia's tardiness and the meeting breaks up after Mrs. Hamilton threatens to withdraw her support unless satisfied. Julia mentions seeing the professor and gives Henry the ancient coin, which he angrily dismisses as worthless. Trying to make amends for his curtness, Henry asks Julia to have lunch with him the following day as they used to do, and she delightedly agrees. After retiring to his study, however, Henry is beset by messages and demands on his time. Dismissing his assistant, Mildred Cassaway, Henry prays for guidance, and a few moments later, Dudley mysteriously arrives and informs Henry that he is an angel sent in answer to his prayer. Henry is immediately skeptical, and when Julia comes in a few moments later, Dudley introduces himself as Henry's assistant, which pleases her and upsets Henry. The next morning Henry is dismayed to see that Dudley has returned and ingratiated himself with Mildred Cassaway, the maid, Matilda, and even the family dog, Queenie. Julia is disappointed that Henry has broken their luncheon date and sadly takes their young daughter Debby to the park. After Henry departs, Dudley follows Julia and Debby to the park and helps the little girl build her confidence during a snowball fight. Dudley offers to take Julia to lunch just as Matilda inexplicably shows up to relieve her of Debby. Dudley takes Julia to Michel's, which she reveals is her favorite restaurant and is where Henry proposed to her. When they are spotted by several parish ladies, Dudley wards off gossip by inviting them to join him and Julia. Walking home later, Julia and Dudley run into the professor, who is suspicious of Dudley, yet invites them to his tiny apartment, where he admits that due to a lack of inspiration he has not worked for some time on his manuscript about ancient Rome. Dudley, who has retrieved the ancient coin from the Brougahms', returns it to the professor and piques his interest by informing him of the rare and valuable coin's unique history. Meanwhile, Henry has rescheduled his appointments so that he can make his lunch date with Julia and is annoyed to discover that she has gone out with Dudley. The next day, Dudley tells Debby the story of David, who is helped by an angel, which only vexes Henry further. Later, Henry accepts an appointment to meet with Mrs. Hamilton, knowing it will conflict with his promised appearance at choir practice at his old parish. Despite Julia's pleas, Henry insists on seeing Mrs. Hamilton, and Dudley accompanies Julia to the rehearsal. At Mrs. Hamilton's, Henry agrees to all her demands in exchange for her complete support of the cathedral but, while hastening to leave to meet Julia, finds himself stuck to a recently varnished chair. At the church, meanwhile, Rev. Miller is embarrassed by the poor turnout, but Dudley reassures him and asks the couple of boys present to begin singing. Gradually all the boys arrive and give an inspiring performance under Dudley's direction. As the still-stuck Henry fumes at Mrs. Hamilton's, Dudley and Julia catch a cab into town where Dudley purchases a hat for Julia he knows she admires. Then Dudley asks the cab driver, Sylvester, to stop at a park where a crowd is ice skating and, with Dudley's guidance, both Julia and Sylvester skate enthusiastically. Dudley and Julia return home, where Henry angrily demands that Dudley leave for good. Henry's outburst depresses Julia, and the next day, Christmas Eve, the household wonders if Dudley will ever return. After Henry and Julia leave to make calls, Dudley arrives and rewrites Henry's Christmas sermon, dictating while the typewriter takes down the new speech. Dudley then transforms the Christmas tree over which Matilda has been laboring and departs to see Mrs. Hamilton. While waiting in the wealthy woman's drawing room, Dudley discovers a hidden piece of sheet music inscribed to Mrs. Hamilton from a man who is not her husband. Dudley plays the tune on Mrs. Hamilton's harp, and she confesses that in her youth she was in love with the tune's composer, but feared poverty and rejected him. In an effort to make up for not loving her wealthy husband, she has steadfastly tried to maintain his legacy. Later, when Henry and Julia arrive, Mrs. Hamilton thanks Henry for sending Dudley to her and tells them that he has inspired her to give her money to the needy rather than build the cathedral. Utterly dismayed, Henry tells Julia he will meet her at home and, wandering into town, stops by the professor's, where he confides that Dudley is an angel who has upset everything. He apologizes for rejecting the professor's coin, which the old scholar returns to him, declaring that it has inspired him and may help Henry too. When Henry sadly reveals he believes he has lost Julia to Dudley, the professor reminds him that he is human and Dudley is not and encourages him to fight for Julia. At the Broughams' home, while Dudley and Julia stand admiring the Christmas tree, Dudley tells her it is time for him to leave, but asks her to have him stay. Disturbed by his implication, Julia tells him that he must go and hastens upstairs just as Henry arrives to challenge Dudley. Dudley is pleased that Henry has finally acknowledged that Julia is the most important thing in his life and reminds the bishop that he never prayed for a cathedral, but for guidance. He wistfully adds that it is bad when an angel envies a mortal and informs Henry that after he goes, no one will have any memory of his existence. Henry then finds himself alone in his study praying before the painting of the cathedral, and abruptly races upstairs looking for Julia, who is putting Debby to bed. They embrace and then depart for St. Timothy's where Henry delivers Dudley's Christmas sermon. Dudley listens from the street, and satisfied, departs.<br /> The Bishop's Wife (1947) is a Samuel Goldwyn romantic comedy feature film starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven in a story about an angel who helps a bishop with his problems.

B001232NG8|5.0|After all these years it's still as haunting and dark as ever. Take note digital children. This is raw and real  emotion, played by real humans, playing real instruments. You can't fake this stuff with samples and loops. Like Zeppelin, The Who, and so many other great bands of the era. This is the kind of magic that happens when the right combination of players are put in same room together. Take away one of them and it just isn't the same.
1401216676|5.0|This book is a perfect representation of the Joker. He makes you laugh, then feel bad about what you're laughing at. This is such an intense tale of an absolutley brilliant maniac. The plan that he puts into action in this story is not for the children, esspecially when a certain someone's daughter gets plugged in the ribs. What follows is a \\"how to\\" on driving a father completely insane. The way it ends lets you know just how much Batman and the Joker love to hate eachother.
B0011HF6GE|4.0|Songwriter Justin Vernon showcases his beautifully unique talent with the release of \\"For Emma, forever ago.\\" Utilizing a stripped, minimal soundscape of solo guitar, layered vocals and some electronics, Vernon creates a virtual diary of song that is moving, beautiful, and at times voyeuristic. This album seems devastatingly genuine, and painfully crafted.     Although a solo work driven mainly by guitar, Vernon avoids monotony through his selective use of voice layering, electronic accompaniment, and the support of choice vocalists. Each song on this album is capable of standing alone as a work, but that would do the album a disservice.    Vernon's work shows not only inventive songwriting, but also a poetic and meaningful lyricism imbued in every song. If nothing else, he will be regarded as a poet.
B000PI3UO0|5.0|Air Force One is one of my favorite action movie.. The movie was great and exciting but I think the dvd is a little outdated when compared to other dvd's these days as it does not have any special bonus features. The only thing good about it is the commentary from director Wolfgang Peterson who provides several insights on the making of the movie in the commentary. I think that it is time the studio release a special edition 2 disc dvd set of the movie. I would definitely love to see a behind the scenes look at the movie. Such as how they did the accurate looking set for the plane etc.. Maybe some deleted scenes if there were any. Common Sony pictures! Bring out the special edition already!!!!
0061537934|5.0|One of the most moving books I've ever read. Great storytelling. Great ending. It will make you laugh and cry and laugh within minutes. I got a copy from the library but I'm planning to get my own to read it again.
0316017922|3.0|I gave this book three stars. Two means you do not like it. That is a tad strong. On the other hand three stars (It's OK.) is also not quite right. The book -- small pages, large print, around 200 pages -- is not like one of those cheesy self help books with 2/3 padding but this book is padded. The idea -- the quirky things that make for success -- is a good one and the book starts out fine. Gladwell, however, does not have enough examples to fill a book. So, he starts with birth dates of hockey player but then goes to socioeconomic class (hardly news) and then a extended narrative about himself.     Even at its most interesting there are problem. For example, if hockey and other sports stars tend to be the oldest kids in the age group, are college football stars the ones who flunked an early grade? If his theory holds, who not check across several contexts.     The book is just thin in more than one way.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Movies like this are so remarkable.<br /><br />For one thing they aren't violent, there isn't danger, things don't blow up, you aren't chased, no ones getting murdered. I really myself won't go to that again in this life. Sorry. Over it... They might not even be beautiful physically to watch in the unfolding of the story line, another wonderful feature,  altho here they are. It's a deceptively real kind of story that feels like a life you might want to look into, vicariously try.<br /><br />Perhaps a relating that wraps you in the love these two shared through a lifetime of letters wouldn't appeal to everyone, but watching two physically attractive, vapid stars careen around in current love stories with houses and background settings costing several million if \\"in\\" the real world seems too vacuous for a love setting to me. It doesn't appeal to much of anything in me. This really isn't the Enquirer come to life with a script.<br /><br />Three of the most important relationships in my life evolved through writing. The most important one was written there.  Not to be self involved, so the tenderness of this bookshop owner  in England and the writer in New York, their writing and their unfolding what surely is a love, surely of a kind, that resonated. As did the times of their lives, seasons. Heck I loved the apartment and the bookshop ( loved that as much as any of it ) never failing to be thrilled by how the settings figured in the movie. It was such an intimate reality almost a play. Almost.<br /><br />I will admit that I've watched this quite a few times over the years and after once or twice cannot go all the way (to the end), it's beautiful and I'm like that. It's poignant, I'm aware to speak to it is a spoiler though quite oddly the etiquettes here seem to deny and demand analysis. But of that ending how interesting that the characters were written in such a way that neither in the length of their relating ever hurt the other, they valued one another so highly. How rare and to be treasured is that kind of knowing.<br /><br />Letter writing has been replaced by the e world. Faster, glibber, more corrective, snappier, more unkind, disposable relations, meeting a need, finding faults, weighing another, it can feel frenzied, characterized by telling another how you either have to go or cannot continue to actually put effort into some thoughts to share over how you are pulled there from the difficulties of life to share,  it isn't what relating in letters once was....no...many won't supply the correct name or an address to get a letter or card because while writing and sharing is ok, I suppose the idea is they can't \\"risk\\" that with \\"you\\", a strangeness not of this movie.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|This turntable works well, and the software bundled with the unit is reasonably easy to use and runs fine.  I have another Sony turntable hooked to my audio system but found it too cumbersome to use to digitize my records.  The USB connection on this unit is just what the doctor ordered.  I'm having fun.  The only problem is getting the software to recognize tracks, but found a pretty simple work-around.  Other than that, no problems.
0743201140|1.0|Well I 'm glad I read the book and took the survey. But the book left me very frustrated and is a very disappointing book.<br /><br />Yeah it's nice to know my strengths but the entire summary is one paragraph of less then two dozen sentences; and three short (as very few sentences) anecdotes for that attribute.<br /><br />This book should be sold to target individuals. The manager's chapter on how to deal with their direct reports is very shallow and it sets the reader up to realize you have to buy a book per person since there are no license purchase abilities to use this book and it's tools as a useful corporate tool. The fact that a manager would have to buy boxes of books is sad. So one has to resort to \\"creative\\" marketing to drum up business?<br /><br />Discovery of strengths is just the first step. We, at work, have gone through several stages of a similar process and it took months and the individual sessions and the supervisors and team sessions took hours. So my critique is based on extensive experience of going through several of these type of personality analysis. This is not a do it yourself project for a manager.<br /><br />The authors would serve the public better if they told the reader up front that this is an introduction to this deep topic and that for further comprehension they can be reached for corporate level consultations.<br /><br />Once I entered the web site that was my assessment of this book. That this is nothing more then a shallow carrot to gain more corporate consultation business.<br /><br />I finished reading the book and was very frustrated and angry at how shallow the entire topic is and am frankly surprised at how many fawned over this book. The marketing ploy of having a unique access ID printed on the back of the book is deceptive and very disingenuous at best. I'm sure the author is aware of the \\"used book\\" market. So forcing the buyer to buy another one is wrong on so many levels. If this book is as good as you critics raveand the authors claim then one would think that the purchaser should be able to share the new discovery with spouse or friend and spread the new found source of knowledge thus generating greater interest and possibly more business for consultation.<br /><br />Based on the business model, I now see, I regret telling my friends to go out and purchase this book. I will now tell them to not purchase this book and rather to seek other sources to achieve the same goal.<br /><br />This book rates a one star only because of the little new found information gleaned from a verbosely written book that could have been summed up in a pamphlet.<br /><br />Oh yes the reports we got at work from our industrial psychologists were about 15 pages of in-depth analysis of our strengths and weakness. I was expecting deeper insight to each of the attributes  and instead discovered a one short paragraph summary of which the computer generated report also regurgitated the same summary as the book and did not provide any in-depth insight at all.<br /><br />I just paid $32 to learn that there is one born every minute and I was another one of those!
B000YEUUCK|5.0|This concert is truly Las Vegas style all the way - very showy!  Celine's performance, as usual, is terrific.  The audio and video in Blue-Ray cannot be topped - probably one of the best I've seen or heard.  There are lots of special features which are very interesting. This is a real treasure for any of Celine's fans.  Top-notch.
B00129H7VS|4.0|As you can see by all of the other reviews here, this is a must buy. Band of Brothers is the best World War II film I have ever seen, period! Superb acting, directing and writing. The bonus footage of the World War II veterans is both gripping and emotional. The camera work is amazing as well has it has an intentional grainy 40's feel to it. This is a truly astonishing achievement. The series is five stars all the way but let me nitpick a little. The video quality on these discs are on par with the top tear blu-ray movies out there. The picture sharpness and detail is amazing though it does have a gritty look to it which is intentional and is no problem at all. However, there is apparant noise on certain scenes of each disc, mainly in darker shot scenes which may be incode related. This is a minor nickpick and I didn't find it distracting while watching the series. Let me stress again, this is minor nickpicking as I am very picky about video and audio quality. This series does look amazing. Bottom line: This is a must buy for casual fans and hardcore fans alike.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Wow, what a blast from the past! I am thoroughly enjoying reliving my pre-teen years thanks to the \\"Beverly Hills, 90210\\" DVD sets. This classic cult series revolves around the 16-year-old Walsh twins, Brandon (Jason Priestley) and Brenda (Shannen Doherty), who undergo massive culture shock when their family relocates from Minnesota to sunny Beverly Hills, California. Brandon and Brenda adjust to their new lives pretty quickly, with the help of new friends Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth), Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), Donna Martin (Tori Spelling), Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris), and of course the James Dean-esque Dylan McKay (Luke Perry). Season 1 contains some of the show's most famous episodes, including Brenda's experience manning the teen hotline, Kelly's mother's first rehab stint,and of course Brandon's DUI. Yes, the show is hokey, but I absolutely love it! The series looks great on DVD, and the boxed set also includes several cast interviews and other bonus features, which are a lot of fun to watch. I cannot wait to publish this review and start watching Season 2!
045122499X|4.0|I have now read both of the books Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  I thoroughly enjoyed both of them and highly recommend them to anyone interested in a good read.  I loved the way Follett made history real. His story weaves interesting people into a political setting and made that time in history so much more understandable and real. The books are long but that only made them better for me.
015206396X|2.0|Ok I don't usually post my opinion but I have to with this. This book really holds a reader. It is fast paced, full of adventure, romance, and a strong female character. It has everything that is needed for a book that cann't be put down. I totally loved reading this book until about half way through. This is the reason I am posting a review. Personally I don't enjoy reading about a king who's into incest. I think the writer had a wicked enough character without that flaw in his personality. I felt particularly uncomfortable reading how a young ten year maid could only walk with difficulty after the story implied how she had been raped by the king the night before. This story was strong enough without that.  Also, I realize that people have different opinions regarding pro-life and pro-choice. That is what is great about America freedom of speech and choice. Yet as someone who is pro-life I personally  didn't enjoy the references to the \\"morning after pill\\" in the story.  She is a great writer, but I was disappointed by those two subjects and felt strongly to voice that in writing.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|I became a fan off Eastwood's at an early age after seeing High Plains Drifter. I thought all he could do were cowboy movies and Dirty Harry. Not so. The Bridges of Madison County shows that Eastwood has terrific range, and is a joy to watch,  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B000001FN1|5.0|triumph and agony has to be warlocks best album to date! being that its song tracks include all we are, i rule the ruins, kiss of death, three minute warning, These are just a few of the great jams on this record. Also, with this being doro pesch's final album with warlock, even though they they only put out 4 albums and a demo i would recomend triumph and agony over burning the witches, hellbound and heart of steel. Though i own all 4 albums i play Triumph and agony the most becuse it has the most hits on it. Their hardest album out of the set, has to be hellbound, for the simple reason is the riffs! but not their best. If your more into thrash u may want to buy burning the witches, cause it was warlock's debut album and it rips!! but Triumph and agony kicks majorly!!! The opening track, All we are, comes out with a bang like a major punch to the face!! buy it, play it, and you wont be sorry. Not to mention, it features tommy bolin on lead and rhythm guitar!! if you dont know who tommy bolin is, he is the T.Rex guy that did get it on, (bang a gong)! and was with deep purple with whitesnake legend david coverdale,on lead vocals, before whitesnake. well i hope this review helps you out i recomend this album more than most considering that i own many cds, lp's and i play this the most! buy it and let the rockin begin!!!!!!.UP THE IRONS!!!!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Contemporary music's great romantic realist tells us it may be \\"Modern Times\\" but the battle remains the same - The human heart in conflict with itself (as William Faulkner called it).   Longtime fans will be glad to know Dylan's story-telling abilities and rebelliousness haven't dimmed a bit. Every one of the 10 songs is way longer than 3:05, yet another instance of Dylan giving corporate radio the back of his hand. Master Bob is going to say his piece and that's that. And - he whispers to the suits and others in \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" - \\"Some day you'll be glad to have me around.\\"   \\"Workingman's Blues No. 2\\" is a classic - no other way to describe it. Dylan stacks the crumbling of the American economy and the fading of national promise alongside personal relationship difficulties in a very poignant way.   Our artist does similar in \\"The Levee's Going to Break,\\" marrying an obvious Hurricane Katrina news reference to individual and national recklessness.   Religious and cultural references - \\"Darkness on the face of the deep\\" from the Book of Genesis appears in \\"Spirit on the Water\\" and \\"In the Still of the Night\\" from the Platters and the annals of classic R&B/rock gets into \\"When The Deal Goes Down\\" - bump up against us and are quickly gone, true to the pace and experience of modern life. Dylan scatters them discreetly, avoiding being \\"a man who thinks in slogans,\\" as George Orwell once put it.   Dylan sounds briefly like one of Orwell's smiling totalitarians in \\"Someday Baby\\" when he sings \\"I keep recycling the same old thoughts.\\" Then we realize that conformists don't think this deeply. The artist is merely reflecting what King Solomon said centuries before about the human condition - there's nothing new under the sun.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The timeless production has been made even more realistic with this excellent Two-Disc Set.  The colourised version is quite stunning.  A film to have every Christmas to remind us of how significant some people are in this insignificant world.  Just by being a normal person doing normal things, by being imperfect but treating others as you would like them treat you and through the help of the heavens, we can spread our goodness to others without awareness, until a crisis occurs and then everyone realizes what effect this has on others.  I have several versions but I can't recommend this one highly enough.
B000WPDCTE|5.0|My college French major daughter had to watch this for her upper level conversation class.  She told me that the whole class would have been rolling on the floor with laughter if there had only been enough room in the classroom.  If you are a conservative concerned with morals, as I am, you have to use your own judgement about the age at which you want your kids watching this.  There is no nudity, and there are no \\"bedroom scenes\\"; but the plot does center around the habit of many Frenchmen of having a wife and a mistress, and there is some language.  That being said, the film hilariously illustrates that \\"what goes around comes around\\" and leaves you wondering who the real idiot(s) is/are.  There are subtitles for the conversation, and the acting is excellent.  If you are a student of the French language, you will probably be able to pick up a lot of the conversation.  Highly, highly recommended with the reservations stated above--the kind of movie you can watch over and over and laugh every time.
0875428940|5.0|The Robin Wood Tarot is my new favorite deck. The images are beautiful with rich symbolism both in the Waite-Smith traditions and in Celtic and magical lore.  The Magician is a delightful Herne-like figure, filled with joy and power.  Other cards, such as Judgement, receive an alternative handling which, to me, makes their meaning much clearer.  Human figures are rendered with life and sexuality.    I find this to be a very energetic deck.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Tropic Thunder is a great comedy that has some fresh ideas.  At some points pushing the envelope in material which adds to its greatness.  The entire cast works great together, and Tom Cruise when on screen steals the show.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This movie was just as entertaining to the adults as the kids, nice to watch a CLEAN movie with no suggestive humor!!
B001DSNF8C|4.0|The reinvention of James Bond starts off perfect. Bond is edgy and has the classic Bond swagger.  The blu ray is great quality and is a must have for HD owners.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|5.0 out of 5 stars Great Little Thrill Ride!, December 17, 2008<br /><br />If you want a simple, straightforward action adventure movie, look no further.<br /><br />Great production values, good acting, lots of shooting and explosions, and a car chase to rival anything done before (no kidding!).<br /><br />Understand, this is a sort of a comic book on steroids, so you'll only get a little character development. You won't get any deep or complex thoughts, or any difficult to understand plots (while there's one plot twist, it's pretty easy to see coming, and it's an homage to a plot twist in Star Wars, so it'll be familiar when it shows up).<br /><br />Overall, this is slick, fast, and brilliantly executed. The lead character did a nice job of moving from nerdy and repressed to the king of killers, but that's the only character development in the entire movie, and it's the core of the movie.<br /><br />A quick summary: the band of super assassins must train a wet behind the ears kid to be the perfect killer. He has the personality of Caspar Milquetoast, and is afraid of his own shadow, so their work is cut out for them. They use a sort of Zen training coupled with beating the living heck out of him, which is a very effective training technique in comic books and action movies (hey, they almost had enough training scenes for a good montage!).<br /><br />Ultimately the kid comes into his own (kinda like Luke Skywalker) and justice or something like it triumphs. With lots of gunshots, explosions, and time-bombed rats with wristwatches tied on them like fashion belts (I'm not making this up!).<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is perfect as the action heroine with a deeply hidden heart of gold, and James McAvoy who plays the lead was magnificent as nerd/sortofsuperhero.<br /><br />If you like action movies, this is your cup of tea, and you'll love it.<br /><br />If you like psychological drama, or escapist fantasy with philosophical overtones, or romantic comedy, you really want to go elsewhere.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|A fabulous production of the classic original series.  Far ahead of its time, this series with the digitization and sound improvements demonstrates why so many immensely popular series were fathered by it.  I feel if it had been brought out 20 years later, it would have survived equally as well as SG1 did.  Thoroughly enjoyed!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I don't usually watch a movie more than once; after I've seen it, well, I've seen it.  But this movie stayed with me.  I've watched it time and time again.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|I think this was one of the greatest movies. I had read the book,which was a little more exciting. But I did enjoy the movie as well
B0017XFBMG|5.0|Say Pogue Mahone then get ready to fight.  This 5 CD collection blasts a new cap into the Boys from County Hell.  From the clunky but drunk spanking of the kerry polka to the lord santy's fairest daughter any pogue fan will attest to sean's genius climbing the banks of sweet melody to the chasm of vengeful death blows. Hot Dogs with Everyting, greenland whale fisheries, billy's bones, night train to lorca refocus pogue fans to this battle triumph. No collection is complete until this box is soaked in your bushmills.
B001GAOY5U|3.0|After twenty minutes of trying to work out the deep purples and blacks in the 3D version we switched to the very clear 2D version. In our spare time we will continue to play with the brightness and color controls on our 46\\" Sharp Aquos but \\"out of the box 3D\\" it's not.
B0017APQ1K|5.0|brilliant. For the history alone, this is a fantastic disc. sharp pic and sound and beautifully shot. highly recommended.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|For those who have seen and love Indiana Jones' adventures, \\"...The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" follows the formulary of the previous exciting and wonderful films.  They had enough campy lines in them to make them memorable in every way. This is a must see because it is part of the Indiana Jones series.  But it portends a bigger and better sequal for us jaded action film goers where story development is as important as action.  Four stars.
B00005ASGG|5.0|What a great western. You can't get much better than this one. John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart together for get about it!
B000002LMM|5.0|I was never a fan of the series and saw very little of it, but one scene with a dwarf speaking backwards/forwards is very memorable.  Another scene in a barn, with a foghorn in the background for no reason at all was brilliant.  David Lynch has a great ear for sound and Angelo Badalamenti compliments that perfectly.<br /><br />I first heard this CD in an oil painting class and I still love it.  It is great \\"background music\\" for artistic exploration, or intellectual pondering.  The CD is largely instrumental and creates a very consistent mysterious mood, punctuated by a few short surprises.  If you are in a relaxed mindset, you can play this CD over and over and it never really gets boring, it just keeps on flowing.  Time stops, and there is just the music, and you; and you are enchanted.  Welcome to Twin Peaks.
B00004XQ8H|5.0|Strauss is not an easy conductor to sing as it requires a great deal of stamina, control to manage the high tessitura and heady tone. Della Casa's interpretation -the first studio recording of the work sets an example for the rest to follow. Consistently from beginning to end she pours forth luscious silvery reed tones that captures the enigmation of the pieces. Perhaps a little less profound in interpretation but the beauty of the voice is sheer joy. The ease to which she soars is incredible. The rest of the pieces are stunning but I would agree that the Monologue scena from Capriccio crowns this particular disc which the engineers have done exceptionally well in their remastering. There are other great Four Last songs recordings too that often match what Della Casa has delivered and apart from this most cherished disc, any Strauss lover cannot go without the following:   Schwarzkopf with Szell for sheer interpretation although less so for beauty of tone.  Te Kanawa with Davis - the magnificence of the voice is stunning. In a way she parallels Della Casa in their choice of work- they were both exceptional in Strauss and Mozart. Not many people know of this recording.  Norman with Masur- bigger than life and slower but gloriously vibrant.  Janowitz- purity dominates and she gives the work an ethereal quality.  Fleming with Eschenbach- devoid of most mannerisms this is Fleming's most charasmatic Strauss recording to date.  M.Price with Abbado (live)- pity she never recorded it in studio with the likes of Kleiber but the live recording shows the sopranos gift for luminous tone and interpretation.    Overall the standards for the work are exceptional and most past and present day sopranos have recorded the work but most of them apart from the afore-mentioned are not that memorable. But we should find joy in the many that are available to us.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|If you've never seen these women in person you have missed a great opportunity to be entertained. Great voices and great songs.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I'm a HUGE Doctor Who fan, so I was super excited when I got my 4th season in the mail! (it was a couple days late so that kinda bugged me but other than that once it got there all was forgotten) This season is my second favorite season so far so I'm sure any Who fan would be happy to see it. The only thing that's not so great about it is that there aren't as many special features on it as there have been on past seasons of Doctor Who box sets. Other than that it's great, I love it, and totally recommend it to anyone!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Good presentation box, flipping through the booklet of episodes with descriptions and pictures made me more excited. Reading the commentary by Aaron Sorkin and the Pilot script in the second booklet made me laugh out loud. Watching the episodes brought back the same excitement, hope and overall good feeling that I got weekly years ago. The ultimate gift for West Wing fans!! Must have!!! I can't get enough of it.
B000FTACU4|5.0|Wong Kar Wai's \\"In the mood for love\\" is a touching and poignant film whose lyrical beauty overpasses the formal contain. The ritual of the images supported by the tender music  as a musical adagio that conforms a slender and poetically erotic film. The musical support of Nat King Cole's voice in clever sequences gives a particular flavour.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|ok - total honesty here: we haven't listened to this cd yet. we bought one for ourselves and one for our best friend for christmas. we've decided to wait til then to play it - oh, the anticipation. i am pretty sure it's going to be bomb, come on now, it's the offspring.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|From Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, along three hundred and sixteen miles of distance, there are delirious landscapes plenty of showy vegetation and fiery thunders, Alvin Straight(Richard Fansworth,73) will undertake a particular last epic journey just to meet with his brother, after ten years of mutual absence.<br /><br />Along this poetic road movie, this old man will live a very pleasant experience exchanging points of view about multiple livings, like opening a hidden diary showing the deepest of his soul and heart to everyone.<br /><br />Since the times of \\"The elephant man\\" David Lynch had not focused with such ceaseless devotion and profound affection about the power of the human feelings.<br /><br />A film that exudes visual freshness, unforgettable sunsets and mesmerizing landscapes, without forgetting those little and unsaid details of the human behavior.<br /><br />A full rounded masterwork and formidable actings.!
