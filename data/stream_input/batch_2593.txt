B008JFUP0I|5.0|I took my 11 year old daughter to this movie today and it ROCKED!! Though you'd think that we would have loved the fight scenes with Vin or The Rock beating up the bad guys, we actually found our favorite scenes were the two girls beating the crap out of each other..Fun to watch !! We will buy this movie as soon as it is released...Fast Five was great but this one beat it hands down...
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books, but after three of pretty much the same thing happening over and over, I'm bored. At least they did step the relationship up. Even Cary started to bore me. Is it Trey, or is it Tatiana?
B00D6MJOAQ|4.0|When you press play sounds come out. Mostly melodic and pleasant. It lasts a pretty long time. More than an hour.
1405910275|1.0|Why was this book even written! I fell in love with the first two books and I waited 6 months for this garbage! What a joke!  I read the first two books within 2-3 days this book I couldnt get into......it was just a struggle.... this book was nothing but Eva thinking how hot Gideon is WE got it already!! How many times do you have to repeat yourself!  And this stupid rock star brett was stupid. You have Eva sexually attracted to him...Wtf was that! And who cares about Corinne and Deanna...I lost count how many times I threw this book down and pick it up days later to continue with this catastrophe of a book to find out there is going to be another book!
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|What a pleasure it was to listen to this album , produced in the confines of Willie Mitchell's  recording studios in Memphis, record an album that just reconfirmed my faith and love of Boz as a musical icon who , when determined to deliver music which reflects his wide ranging passion of different styles, blues, RnB, soul, melodic soulful ballads etc got it very right and made the music we know and love from him.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is challenging enough to be fun, but not hard enough to not win. I can't wait until there are more levels.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|This is a great remake of a classic romance. The story is interesting and characters are nicely developed by this cast.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|If you like faintly spicy historical romance (it's there but not too graphic), a touch of steampunk, a smidgeon of the supernatural, and lots of comedy all mixed together this is a winning combination.<br /><br />The heroine is strong, the hero is strong and they are both strong-headed. It's a miracle anyone gets a word in edgewise when the two of them clash.<br /><br />The story line evolves nicely over the 5 books. There is one book that I felt wasn't up to par with the others but that is fairly common with books that are setups for the next in the series. Honestly it wasn't that bad as these things go.<br /><br />I thought is was an original ending for this type of supernatural story but I admit aside from Buffy the Vampire Slayer I'me completely out of it.<br /><br />I was very happy with the price since I'd already read it and just want the convenience of accessing it at any time.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Not as good as I expected it to be.  Kind of corny if you ask me.  I was not too impressed.  Nothing special.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|Who thought of this?<br /><br />The Kindle has lousy speakers. These soundtracks are not relaxing using the Kindle speakers.  You have to listen through headphones.<br /><br />Sleeping, meditating and yoga with headphones - has anyone heard of ear cartilage fatigue? If not, try wearing headphones for several hours - every day.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|Installing this app was as much a waste of time as trying to get the NAS that was to work with it to.. well... work.
B003AWRM9W|5.0|My husband likes this movie and it is a good show and I am glad to have it in our collection.  Thanks.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I've watched this numerous times, just for the music. We had to pick up the soundtrack! Interesting storyline, great music, and pretty funny. Not much to not like!
B00CWX1HPA|1.0|The original movie was 3 hours/180 min.  This version is 125 min. and so should be boycotted.  We waited years for this 1978 classic to arrive on blu ray.  When finally arrival occurred, the version is garbage akin to cutting out the 5 min. from Marathon Man blu ray release.  Studios jerk us around, hoping we'll buy known garbage release #1, improved #2, and then finally proper release #3.  Same thing with current \\"improved\\" Terminator release.  I'll wait a few more years, thank you!
B0058VW36U|5.0|love it and it is so adding but it is a dollar but it is a lot of fun so say get it
B003G4W49C|3.0|I love this book. I'm only a 10 year old girl, yet I love science fiction. Ender is a great boy in the book, and Speaker for the Dead and the rest of the series is good too. You know how many books I read these last 3 years? Exactly 34. You know which of those books I liked the most? Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows. You know which I loved the most? Catching Fire. (You know, the Hunger Games) You know which book I thought was THE BEST BOOK EVER?  OF Course, Enders game. YOU WILL LOVE IT BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST BOOK EVER AND I PUT 3 STARS JUST SO YOU CAN FIND THIS REVIEW EASILY. ENDER IS WAITING FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK A MILLION STAR REVIEW! - Zoey
0375869026|5.0|reposted from my blog: [...]<br /><br />A few weeks back, I ranted a bit (okay, a lot), about the absence of aspirational heroes in Middle-Grade fiction these days. For the most part, I'm still feeling tantram-y about the general state of things in this regard.<br /><br />HOWEVER--<br /><br />WONDER, by R.J. Palacio , goes a long way to correct this.<br /><br />Let's face it: there are books and then, there are BOOKS! And, by the latter category, I mean those rare gems that not only captivate us but also change us--for the better--by us having had the good fortune to have read them.<br /><br />WONDER is such a wonder. It tilted my obit, just a touch, and here's why:<br /><br />The story is about Auggie, a normal kid with a horrifying facial deformity. Yes, I said *deformity* although, like everyone else in the story, the impact of that word diminishes for the reader as we, too, get to know this remarkable little man.<br /><br />The story unfolds through the eyes of first, Auggie, then in sections devoted to the people who know and love him. It's a study in perspective---how each character views and copes with the daunting challenges of everyday life when you're always the center of unwanted, and sometimes hostile, attention.<br /><br />The writing is sublime perfection. Simple, and yet, so, so powerful. Palacio's voice carries the sophisticated eloquence needed to lift such a melancholy story into the realm of inspiration.<br /><br />One of my favorite passages:<br /><br />\\"Why do I have to be so ugly, Mommy?\\" I whispered.<br />\\"No, baby, you're not...\\"<br />\\"I know I am.\\"<br />She kissed me all over my face. She kissed my eyes that came down too far. She kissed my cheeks that looked punched in. She kissed my tortoise mouth. She said soft words that I know were meant to help me, but words can't change my face.\\"<br /><br />My heart aches, just typing that.<br /><br />There is so much wisdom in this book. I'm in no way surprised that so many have plucked pearls from its text. I am particularly fond of this one:<br /><br />\\"I think that there should be rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.\\"<br /><br />Wouldn't we all be better people if we gave more of those and received at least one?<br /><br />Read this book. You'll be grateful you did.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fun game. If you like this you should really get Lep's World 2. The only bad thing about this game is you can not pick a level if you want to go back. Other wise it is a great game.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|Rarely has an adaptation from a classic childhood story been so seamless, visually stunning, and truly entertaining. Originally written as a novel by J.M Barrie in 1904, and then for the London stage soon after, the legend of The Boy Who Never Grew Up entered American mainstream with the 1953 animated Disney version, which, although popular, failed to accurately capture the at times dark subject matter of the original storyline. Now, in 2003, under the guidance of director P.J. Hogan, Peter Pan has been given a live-action cast, the advances of modern filmmaking, and an overall look that is remarkably refreshing to a much wider age range of watchers.<br />Wendy Darling (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is a bright-eyed, and intelligent London girl who delights in telling captivating stories and sword fighting with her two younger brothers John and Michael (Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell, respectively). But, one day, much to Wendy's dismay, her parents and aunt lay down an ultimatum: It has come time for her to grow up, and leave the nursery and her childhood behind. That night, after Mr. and Mrs. Darling leave for a party and the Darling children are all snug in their beds, a magical boy named Peter Pan enters through their open window and with the help of fairy dust and happy thoughts, whisks them away to Neverland, a magical paradise in which you never grow old, and all the characters from Wendy's stories come to life. From adventures with the pirates of the Jolly Roger, commanded by evil Captain Hook, to Indians and fairies, the delightful story comes to life once again on a grand scale.<br /><br />In the terms of performances, most of the young cast are first-time actors, virtual unknowns in the business until now. As Wendy, Rachel Hurd-Wood sparkles, and has an innocense and hidden strength of a heroine around her. As for Peter Pan, (this version is the first to use a boy in the role) the search for the right person spanned nearly three continents, and ended with the find of Jeremy Sumpter (known for his part in the thriller \\"Frailty\\"), who is without a doubt, perfect for the role. With his perfectly tousled hair and devilish good looks, he has a spark of confidence, charm, and a cocky little smile, (and still manages to convey his wish for a mother) that completely captures the character of Peter Pan. Jason Isaacs, who plays both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook (following the stage tradition) is delightful in his range of talent in both characters; Mr. Darling is an awkward, stuttering man who cares deeply and sacrifices much for his family, and Captain Hook is a seductive menace who terrorizes Neverland. In this version, the fairy Tinkerbell is played by French actress Ludivine Sagnier, who is at times annoying, but overall an interesting and amusing approach to the role.<br /><br />One of the things that truly stands out in this Peter Pan is the visual effects and the sets. The Darling household and London itself are beautifully done, and Neverland is beyond words. From the cotton-candy esque clouds above and the dense jungles with the hideout of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, to the menacing ticking crocodile hunting Captain Hook, \\"Peter Pan\\" never ceases to amaze, as well as in the realms of costumes and makeup.<br /><br />Sprinkled with humor, and with a crackling script, a brilliant director, and extremely wise choices in casting, sets and costuming, and visual effects, \\"Peter Pan\\" is one of the best movies of the year and will continue to delight audiences for years to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loads of fun and a great time occupier for kids and adults. My 5 year old daughter loves this game.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Loved the book it was awesome and always interesting. I love 're series and characters.  Setting was great and was perfectly written
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really have enjoyed this game.  Challenging but solvable. I love all of the puzzle play.  I would recommend to anyone who loves puzzles.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I expected more especilly compared to 50 shades of gray. The charecters lake of depth, it was More phonograph story then anything alse. The third book left you with more quistions then answer.. no closure to the story.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|The movie has a great 80's alien type movie feel to it. There is done comedy with adventure that last through the whole movie. I would reccomend this movie to a friend.
B000HR86FC|2.0|You could watch it for free on Startrek.com, why anyone would buy this series to watch online on amazon baffles me...<br />The series gets 10 out of 5 stars, but paying to watch it on amazon brings it down to two stars.
0743243153|1.0|this book was written in like the 70's - very difficult to read.  i was expecting an uplifting book because it got so many reviews and it was it read very scientific like.
B00479SVBU|2.0|I have a usb plugged into this and the start of each song gets skipped over / scrambled a little.  It works fine other than that so I haven't returned it.
193700788X|5.0|Great book that makes you have mixed emotions. Really thought about it. some of it a little slow but good overall. Any book that makes you question if happy or sad ending can be mind boggling. sometimes want to change endings and sometimes fine. Great book but others have little more action. Either way I thought great
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved how captivating the characters and plot were! I couldn't put this book down, even though I don't typically read courthouse dramas. This book was so much more than that!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The music is glorious.  Fun to see it with different cast members.  Would love to see it live<br />but that's not doable, so this is fine.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|I'm sure I would have given it a greater rating if it were on something other than my phone. The small screen just didn't work out for me.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is a keeper, for sure.  The music is beautiful, performances are strong, and the message of endurance, faith<br />and forgiveness is a message for the ages.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I love this movie and all of the episodes during the time it was on TV.  It is a really good chick flick.  I watch this on a Friday night when I want to forget about the world outside.  Mindless, relaxing, funny and real.
B0063GORYU|3.0|This is another game that I never quite understood and I have<br />a hard time trying to find the directions, I am sure they are there,<br />just never have figured out to find the directions.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Thanks James for a roller coaster ride and keeping me gripped until the climatic conclusion. Looking forward to reading more of your books.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece of an app. I really like how you can mix the sounds. Highly recommended & worth the price. I like it better than other white noise apps.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I like this game, it is very addicting. Why they charge $0.99 on Amazon when you can get it free from Google's \\"Play Store\\" is beyond me. Save your money folks.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Has something for most everyone: Comedy, Drama; Music. Gene Kelly's &#34;Singing in the rain&#34; song and dance number in the rain is legendary. Check out the extra material where it's discussed how they prepared the site for this classic number.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Great album!! Any true deth fan will love this record, its definitely in the top 5 albums for me in there discography.<br /> Buy it!
B00D8WJ9JK|2.0|What a waste, beats are sooooo boring. Even though he can spit with the best of them, the songs are just boring. Im sorry but the beat,  first and foremost has to be decent for me not to skip the song.<br /><br />Even the title track wasnt worth downloading. I read in an article that he started 'fresh' on this album all 'new stuff'., Well, it sucks. so go back to what made you famous, you know.. GOOD MUSIC.. not this crap that someone put together with keyboard cat
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|No plot.<br />No character development.<br />Created more questions than it answered.<br />Obviously, a shameless money grab extending the original 3 books to 5.<br />Seriously, don't waste your time!  I'm upset that I can't return this pile of crap, since I bought through Apple and they don't do returns.  So glad to know Amazon does though.  If I could give it negative stars I would.  The author lost me forever, this could have been a neatly wrapped up story ending a series that sucked a lot of people in from the beginning, but no.  Either the author is seriously blocked for material or the publisher asked her to milk it by turning the last book into 3.  Sucks either way.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I love all the Iron Man movies, but the first is always going to be my favorite. The DVD's were in excellent shape when they arrived, and they were packaged so well I actually struggled to open the mailer it came in! Plus the two disc wasn't very expensive; where as the second movie (only the single disc) cost way more. It was pretty awesome ^^
0385751532|5.0|I enjoyed this book... And where it says it is for kids, you as a parent will need to read it and see if your child can understand all that goes on. It is not too clear in the end on the boys and will promote some good discussions.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is Black Sabbath's last album and it is totally outstanding.  After all these years these lads still got it together.  It will be a repeat player in my CD player in my car for a long time.
0500516766|5.0|I bought this for our grandson's eighth birthday. We enjoyed looking at it together and planned to take some things apart just to see how they were made. It was interesting to see some of the parts that went in to making many of the items. We thought this could be applicable for classroom use or possibly for a science fair project.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Nice to have all 6 ST:TOS movies in one package.  You can argue the merits of each movie, but the Blurays are good quality.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is definitely based on biblical principals but told in a way that anyone can receive it. It contains life changing information!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am an AVID reader, and there have been very few books that I have come across that:<br />a) are wonderfully written<br />b) have made me laugh and cry with the characters<br />c) have made me think so deeply upon my own existence.<br /><br />5 stars, no question.<br />Recommended to ALL.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|A+++++++++++ BRAND NEW MOVIE FAST SHIPPING, MY KIDS LOVE IT, IT WAS STILL IN THE WRAPPER LIKE IT STATED IN THE DETAILS
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great and fun app! will keep u entertained for hours! I love this app! and will recommend it to others!!!
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|The movie is OK as 3D but wait to buy it until the 3D price is less expensive.  Boring is spots.  Not worth the time watching it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good challenging game. My wife and I play this game all the time. Can't get enough. Will differently keep playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's amazing you can spawn your own animals  and build absolutely everything you want.So Please get it's awesome!!!!
B001PP9ALY|3.0|but, I was having a really hard time with how extreme it was but then I just sat back and let it take me away.  I enjoyed Jamesie boy totally, as usual.  At the end, the credits indicated that it was based on a comic book and I was like, \\"Well, now it makes perfect fantastical sense.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game for a 6 year little girl who has played most all this afternoon. Well set up and easy to learn.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I did not realize this was a short story.  A mini Christine it was.  Not one of my favorites.<br />I was a quick read though.
0762445262|5.0|I bought this to use for my JLU or Young Justice playsets and it fits in perfect.  It even works well with Imaginext figures as well.
1934030554|4.0|If you are going to spend &#62;$1K on a power meter you should spend a little on the information needed to get the most out of it.<br /><br />This book is the definitive reference text - like most text books it is not easy going.  For an introduction I'd recommend The Power Meter Handbook (Joe Friel).  Having said that, I'd still get this book as a reference, it is a book that you will need to go back to.<br /><br />All the examples refer to the WKO+ analysis software - so it is kinda like a manual for WKO+.  Maybe someone will rewrite this book for the most excellent GoldenCheeta V3.0 software.<br /><br />regards<br />  Matthew
B003B02PF4|5.0|Throw in a little CIA, FBI, and every other alphabet tend agency and it can only be another power-packed Grisham! I really enjoyed the characters, Italian language, and especially the fast paced final half!!  The man is truly a GREAT storyteller! This is one you'll want to, need to, read quickly!!
034580404X|5.0|I just finished book 1 and now I'm on the second one.  Very intense book!  Not for the faint at heart!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|She is incredable!!!!!! a must have, makes me want more. Which CD should I get next? open to any sugestions.
1423140591|2.0|I was a little disappointed that the cover was so damaged.  The corner was chewed on and the first 100 pages or so were stuck together.  I had to be extra careful to turn pages so I wouldn't tear anything.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I watched this on TV originally but my daughter missed the last several episodes so I ordered it for her.  It arrived before it was due, and she loved it!  The price was quite affordable!  Thanks for a good transaction!
B0000062Y2|5.0|Having grown up listening to the original motion picture soundtrack, I finally purchased the CD 30 years later. Ted Neely is in my opinion the best Jesus for the role. His vocal range and power rock the house.<br /><br />The lyrics and music have weathered several decades, remain true to the spirit, and still strike a chord (pun intended) today. This is a must have for music collectors.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Challenging puzzle game. It even makes failure fun since the objects react with a surprised face when they fly off the table.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app isn't very good, and never was. Forced into it to upload photos, will uninstall once done uploading. Facebook mobile site is terrible, so bad they try to force you into the app, but the only thing app has going for it seems to be that it may allow person to upload images.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game so far.  not too easy not too hard.  hope more levels will follow. hope its kept free or minimal.price.
0375869026|5.0|I thought wonder was a great book!  It was verry inperational book. I think that all kids should read this book.
0062255657|5.0|In this novella, a wise young girl lets the protagonist, a 7-year-old boy, in on a little secret:<br /><br />\\"Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside... Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups.\\"<br /><br />As anyone familiar with Gaiman's work will know, he paints a spell-binding glow in all of his novels that can capture grown-ups just as easily as young adults.  Here, he proves that the girl, Lettie, was right: grown-ups can just as easily be pulled into the world he creates and inhabits just as easily as children.<br /><br />In short, this is the story of a man revisiting a mysterious and clouded occurrence from his childhood when a new lodger in his parents' house reveals the depths of \\"an ocean running beneath the universe, like the dark seawater that laps beneath the wooden boards of an old pier.\\"  Although he remembers little, deep down he knows the truth; of how the Hempstock women that live on the farm and the end of the lane saved him from a horrible fate and are keepers of a knowledge that has passed from many in the world.<br /><br />This is a nostalgic novel, told by an adult recounting the events of his childhood from a cloudy distance.  Although the fantastical elements of this book, like Gaiman's other stories, give it a distinct feel, Gaiman touches on themes that most adults can relate to: the emotional uncertainty of childhood, the feeling of a warm home, and the unsettling combination of fear and amazement that accompanies youth.  Once again, Gaiman assembles a modern myth that is impossible to put down.  I read the book in one sitting and was sad to see it end.  I recommend this book for any current Gaiman fan or any reader looking for an introduction to his adult work.  Although this is labeled an \\"adult\\" book, Gaiman's younger fans will likely enjoy it as well.
0847835073|5.0|Been looking at the pages just recently because I just got it brought down from the U.S. to Buenos Aires via a relative and I have to say this book is very good quality. The pictures are printed very clean onto it and of course contains pictures of Monica Bellucci photographed by many different photographers with different styles. She is indeed and amazing subject and model. But in the photos, you definitely notice how the different photographers project their art. My preferred photographers so far are Fabrizio Ferri, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Ali Mahdavi, Ferdinando Scianna, Helmut Newton, Ellen Von Unwerth, Gian Paolo Barbieri, and an amazing headshot by Ruven Afanador. There is only a couple of pages with writing in it including a section written by Monica herself. There is quite a mix of pictures, especially ones taken during pregnancy and with her children that were just beautiful. And even though I mentioned some preferred photographers and sections, all the photos are very well done. It's amazing how this very lucky woman got to be shot in so many wonderfully made images and there are 200+ images printed on quality paper to look at over and over again. Makes you wish though you can blow up some of them and hang them around the home.
B00A757EFW|1.0|it was too difficult for me to work with. It didn't move smoothly or react the way I tried to get it to. when I tried to move it a shadow of it would come up that would go all over the screen.I had this app for 2 tries, then deleted it because I couldn't work with the &quot;joy&quot;stick
B009GXHOW4|5.0|it lets u change Wat's in your inventory and if your world is survival or creative. just make sure when u do the changes that you are at the homescreen for minecraft or it wont work any questions?  email me at codybarnett66@yahoo.com no caps
B008220BLG|3.0|I really liked the trailer for this movie, so while I was waiting for it to come out on DVD, I read the book.  The book was really good, I thought.  It was kind of different.  The characters were interesting.  The movie is very similar to the book, but leaves out some important interesting plot points.  It also left out a few characters that I thought gave the story a bit more depth.  Perhaps I would have liked it more if I hadn't read the book??
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I'm a Quentin Tarantino junkie and I wasn't disappointed. Though he plays an AWFUL Aussie... and I mean acting, not the character, I was transfixed the whole movie.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I give it 5 stars because it's really a good brand and a super price I really like how it looks
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The transitions through time were not always smooth, or even timely for that matter. Interesting story line. A few of the inner stories were better than alright. Dragged on a bit at times. Gave me crazy dreams.
B005FISC52|5.0|I really liked the way they brought Dan and Chris Keller back for the last season. I also love that everybody gets the happy ending they deserve! I wish Alex had been in it more but I am going to miss everyone from this show! I am so glad I have the dvds to watch whenever I want!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game it really fun but it says that all my friends have updated to this new version so I can't see them and I do not know how to update.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|Now this is how you remaster a great album n the digital world.  Liner notes, packaging, and music are all great.<br />Highly recommended.
B00CC1K320|2.0|negatives:<br />-I thought it would have some sort of snap or lock into the closed position, it does not.<br />-The flip cover feels like I can easily crease it, and it would be permanently damaged.<br />-There is no set easel position, while it can be set to a variety of positions, it feels like it will easily slide out of the easel positions and collapse.<br />-When the cover is flipped open the spine of the case ends up in an awkward position, not flat.<br /><br />Positive:<br />-You can answer or reject calls without flipping open.<br />-It's a case, the screen is protected.<br />-Low key style, not bulky rubber or uber tech-ish.<br />-Protects the phone without increasing the volume by 3x like big bulky super protective cases.<br /><br />Overall the case feels flimsy. I was expecting a higher quality feel for the price.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Just downloaded app, I think it to be wonderful! Video of the exercises simply and clearly demonstrated. Thank you very much! Z
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I'm one of those guys who likes my kindle to feel very book like without carrying paper for in the thousands. This is a great alternative. I'm a bookworm, and as such, my 200+ ebooks need to be stylish. This is a great case. Sturdy, good looking, and functional.<br /><br />If all things we buy could be those three things AND affordable, life would be quite better for us all.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Personally, I never get tired of listening to this. Well worth the price as you'll most likely be replaying it over and over
B0052REUW0|5.0|This book answers possibly the most important question of humanity. Are we getting less violent.<br />And if so, why?<br />Debunking myths, political correctness, and sentimentalist ideologies, Pinker shows us that we really do have a REASON to be optimistic about our species and our societies.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Love the idea that it is written after the war.  collection of stories from the war. Interesting look at the culture and social commentary.

0143034901|2.0|This book is very dark. It takes about 175 pages before you really can get into it. I am not really sure if once you get into it you can't wait to see what happens or you just want it to be over! A good read but not a favorite.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This video is entertaining and of course with Maggie Smith, you cannot go wrong.  It is a delightful story and well scripted.

B00003CXRP|5.0|Just wanted to add my thumbs up for this wonderful movie. It's far more than an updated version of Robinson Crusoe or Swiss Family Robinson. So many good things about it - the scenery, the music, the emotions conveyed so exquisitely. Tom Hanks was never better. I don't love Helen Hunt normally, but she was outstanding. And Wilson...! Perfect blend of suspense, despair, heartbreak, and most of all, hope. A movie you can watch over and over.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|The movie provided a very possible begin to the original. The characters were very convincing as, the witch, OZ, and flying monkeys.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I am going to miss Charlaine's Sookie and the citizen's of Bon Temps, but I am delighted with the way her story ended, with love and promise.
0596009208|5.0|Recommend it this book...<br />This book, as well as series, goes a long way to helping you learn. But sometimes the concepts are not well explained. But works for starters.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It wasn't what I thought it would be...it was better.  I enjoyed it and want to watch it again to see what I missed the first time.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The first two levels were good not too easy not tough but when I tried level 3 the number over the door, the cane, and the dots on the door under the t.v. disappeared and there's no way to beat the level what's up with that!
B00028HBKC|5.0|Very moving movie and really makes you think and appreciate what Jesus did for us. I cry every time I watch it.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Pretty cheesy movie but contained a few laughs. Just not my kind of humor, could be yours though. Good luck!
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I don't know where the critics are coming from.  I am a Superman fan so I would embrace any Superman movie.  But this one is different.  They finally listened to the fans and gave us a movie full of action and story.  They couldn't have picked a better cast.  Absolutely a fabulous job from each cast member!  There were parts that made this grown man cry.. and there were parts that made you want to cheer.  This movie flowed well and fast.  When the ending came I wanted MORE!  And I am hoping this is the start of many movies to come.  This movie didn't even seem like a 2+ hour movie.  An outstanding movie and well worth the wait.  I can't tell you how happy I am to see Hollywood do justice to the Superman universe and story.  As a matter fact, I will be going twice on this.  The only dissapointment I had was the theater was packed and I was forced to sit close to the screen.  Not the best experience but that is not \\"Man Of Steel's\\" fault.  There was only one movie I paid to see twice in the theater and that was the original Spiderman back in 2002.  Man Of Steel will be the next.  I will be going back once the hype dies down.  I will be buying this movie when it is released.  I would pay 30-100 dollars just to rent and watch it in the comfort of my home if I could (streaming through the internet).  Take my money!  I am so glad they are making a fortune on this movie.  I hope they can make two fortunes because it is well deserved!  Thank you to the movie studio for bringing my favorite childhood super hero back to life!  Thank you for introducing him to a new and younger generation.  75 years old and Superman still lives!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|I listened to the album three times and have established a rating properly on the message Ye is trying to send. The album cover as well as some tracks in the album are design to be called \\"home made\\" material, it appeals to the poor, rather the rich. All his songs are packed with dark 808's,Reggae vocals, and dark synths. This album is pure darkness, no moveable tracks, no party themes, no radio hits. The lyrics are not the 'read between the lines' or fancy rhymes, they are just clear and to the point, Dark Fantasy might slightly appeal better to fans, but the message is stronger in Yeezus. Rap is rap, bangers are bangers, Ye always brings something new, and this album doesn't disappoint.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating for Sade because I saw her live and I thought, &#34;the best of the best&#34;.  This CD is no less perfected than her performance was.  She has a style of her own and it represents the music industry well.  If you are a laid-back kind of music lover, then you are going to be very pleased.  She hits a home run for me.

B005C8ENI0|5.0|I fell in love with Matthew McConaughey in his first movie, A Time to Kill.  I feel like I discovered him and I watched him closely as he has grown and expanded his talent, but has refused to be typecast or limited in any way.  His popularity continues to grow and he moves in and out of roles with apparent ease.  Just put him on the screen and let him entertain me.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|WATCH IT ON THE PLANE, HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I GOT INTO.  AFTER WATCH THE MOVIE THEN I THINK I HAVE TO BUY ALL THE FAST AND FURIOUS MOVIES TO CATCH UP THE WHOLE STORY.

The books are very long but most enjoyable and I really got engaged with the characters and the plots.  Dragons, sorcery, Medieval settings, kings...all the good stuff for a good read.

B008XBCJ34|4.0|a lot of movie stores have closed where i am, leaving only superstores (target, wal mart, etc) and none of them had this in stock.  Of course i was able to find it on Amazon in about 5 seconds, received very quickly, and was watching it on my new blu-ray player within a weeks time.
B003KK65KG|4.0|This book does not disappoint.  Picoult does it again, with a difficult topic.  She paints detailed, emotional pictures of each key character and intertwines their tales into a great read.

B004JHY8A8|5.0|Loved it!!! One of the bests books I have ever read. Compelling but sad story, with twists and turns.  fabulously well written.  Couldn't put it down.

B00004RF98|5.0|This is a movie I saw long time ago (I was very young) and I was almost forgetting some parts of the story. Recently I was listening  Mitch Miller And The Gang singing it and decided to buy the DVD. Certainly the overall mastering work  done is excellent.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Excellent.  I bought it the day I heard it reviewed on NPR.  It was even better than they said it would be.
6305161976|5.0|It is very interesting that, in its time this was a very interesting and significant story. Nowadays most probably many young persons  may not understand the very historical meaning associated to it. It is also  much notable the efforts made by the actors and the producer to perform without the technical help of this days.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very fun and is extremely addicting. No complaints here. I can't stop playing! Highly recommend this game.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good on phone and kindle. I recommend. Free and fun. Max out the bike and go to the moon or max out the tank and do the forest or max the monster and run the cave.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|This movie was a favorite when I was young and the conversion to blu-ray is great. I would recommend this to everyone as it is a fantastic movie.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I have been using the free version plus the paid version for abs, and I'm very happy to have this one.  It's great for days I can't get to the gym. I gave it five stars but it should be 4.5.  What's missing as others have noted, is that the woman doing the work out doesn't count the number of repetitions.  You have to keep your own rhythm. After you've done the work out a few times it's not hard,  but a count would improve the app..
B009R659L8|5.0|Another great read by Mary Higgins Clark!  She never fails to provide new twists, turns and suspense in her novels and this was no exception!

God did create us all different for a reason.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie is the best example yet of Quentin Tarentino's cinematic sense of humor in messing with history. His (Oscar-winning) screenplay is saying: &#34;WHAT IF a SLAVE could be FREED and then turn into an all-destroying ANGEL whose wrath brings down at least one small section section of the utterly corrupt & evil empire of the Old South?&#34;<br /><br />Christoph Waltz turns in another Oscar-winning performance (Best Supporting Actor) as the German dentist who turns his back on Medicine and slips into the role of Predator of Bad Guys in the Old West -- a bounty hunter. He makes good money by using his cunning & gunplay to bringing the WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE crowd to justice: ALL DEAD!<br /><br />Django is taken in by the former dentist (King Schultz) to help him identify three wanted men who are working as overseers. Schultz doesn't know what they look loke, but Django does. After some gunslinger training, Django quickly becomes oustanding in his own right in the deadly game of hunting down wanted murderers. He seeks to locate and rescue his wife, who was sold away from the plantation where they were once both held as slaves.<br /><br />Over-the-top bloody violence is a staple of Tarentino movies, and there are plenty of gory gunshot special effects in this entertaining &#34;buddy movie&#34; of two men (Django & Schultz) who bring much-delayed justice to slave masters & outlaws in the South & Old West.<br /><br />Two additional charming features of this film are, in addition to its sense of Moral Rectitude & vengeance falling upon the wicked like Jove's thunderbolt: 1) Tarentino has rounded up just about EVERY living old-time cowboy movie actor for a bit part in the film and 2) Quentin himself appears in it, as one of the villains!

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The charisma and chemistry of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, plus the imaginative science-fiction action, humor and a seemingly inexhaustable parade of imaginative alien bad guys (& good guys) keeps every plot turn fresh in this 3rd M.I.B film.<br /><br />Monster / creature makeup effects for the many alien types are provided by Rick Baker, who appears as one of the aliens in the eulogy ceremony for a deceased agent at Men In Black HQ. Ken Ralston is responsible for other special effects.

The hard sheath is attached to a simple nylon strap for a belt loop completely defeating the support for this very bulky ,heavy knife.  The retaining loop ripped out the first time I wore it and its a floppy mess.  Great knife but useless without a secure sheath.

0062255657|5.0|Over the course of his career, author Neil Gaiman has delighted readers with his storytelling abilities. His almost childlike sensibilities have allowed him to reach audiences through various mediums, spanning from comic books to more traditional children and adult literature. With his latest adult novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, he explores a dark story with enough whimsy and emotion to attract readers of all tastes.<br /><br />The novel begins with a forty something year old man returning to the small English town where he grew up. His old home has long been demolished, but he is drawn instead to a dilapidated farmhouse at the end of the lane. When he arrives there, he begins to reflect on his childhood and the dark events that occurred at the place.<br /><br />He was only seven years old when it began. A quiet boy, more at home with his nose in a book than playing with other children, he was an outcast within his own family. We learn that the family is struggling with money. They decide to move him from his own room to bunk with his sister, leaving an empty bed to rent out. With the arrival of the renter, a mysterious opal miner, dark events begin to occur.<br /><br />The boy meets the three generations of Hempstock women who run the farm at the end of the lane. Lettie Hempstock, who claims to have been eleven years old for a very long time, immediately entrances the boy with her enchanting way with words and conviction that the pond that rests at the very end of the lane is actually an ocean. She agrees to allow him to tag along as she takes a trip to an odd place that lies somewhere between this world and the next. Upon their return from the strange place, an evil is released. Following the untimely death of the mysterious opal miner, this evil takes the form of a menacing nanny, who takes up residence at the boy's home. With the help of the Hempstock women, the boy must vanquish the evil while learning the true meaning of sacrifice.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman is known for his delightfully dark, whimsical fairytales. This novel is no exception. At its heart, this is a coming of age story that beautifully depicts the fun, confusion, magic, and sacrifice of growing up. Gaiman makes these sometimes difficult realities more accessible through his imaginative characters, situations, and pacing. The novel is completely engrossing, begging to be read in a single sitting. With an ending that is both poignant and satisfying, readers of all ages should definitely follow Gaiman to the end of the lane.iman is known for his delightfully dark, whimsical fairytales.

B0084IG7KC|4.0|The Hunger Games was destined to be a blockbuster, from the moment the film began production. The novel, on which the film is based, was the kind of phenomenon of the level of Harry Potter and Twilight that would bring in a built in audience. But with the kind of fan devotion that the novel has, the movie also was tasked with meeting the high expectations of those who enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I'll admit, I was a bit hesitant to explore the whole Hunger Games craze. While I usually enjoy thrillers and adult literature, the novel had enough buzz to warrant my attention. I devoured the book in a day, and was convinced that there was definitely something to the story that I wouldn't mind seeing on film.<br /><br />The movie itself does an efficient, if not inspired, job of translating the novel to the screen. Jennifer Lawrence is the undeniable star as the strong willed Katniss. In the film, Katniss takes the place of her younger sister in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death between male and female tributes from each of the 12 districts of the dystopian world. Because of the limitations of the medium, we aren't given as much character development as the novel provided, but the actors do a fine job at trying to make each character fit into the world.<br /><br />In the novel, there was a subtle hint of political restlessness that gets mostly hidden by the big spectacle of the film. To be fair, there are a few moments where the filmmakers excel at providing deeper emotional insight, particularly during the death of one of the tributes. Unfortunately, the constraints of the film force the plot to move so quickly that most of these subtle moments get blown over.<br /><br />Overall, this a a perfectly fine adaptation of an above average novel. There were no egregious departures from the source material, so fans of the novels should be satisfied. Like the book, the ending is conclusive while still setting the foundation for the continuation of the story. If you haven't read the books or seen the movies, they are definitely worth the few hours they will take for you to experience them. Having experienced the novels and this first movie, I can understand the hype that surrounds the series, and look forward to seeing the adaptation of the second novel, Catching Fire, later this year.aven't read the books or seen the movies, they are definitely worth the few hours they will take for you to experience them.

B00884GR0W|5.0|First off, this is NOT a complete copy of  Minecraft- it's better. Block story is your  classic block-building game, with an unusually unique RPG twist. You can complete quests from multiple quest-givers (story mode), create whatever you can imagine (creative mode), or simply try to survive in a dangerous blocky world (hardcore mode). The graphics are a trillion times better than Minecraft; Block story's Blocks all have unique textures, whereas Minecraft's graphics, while nostalgic for some, make it look like a cruddy beta version. To top it off, it is updated costantly, and with massive improvements each update. If this review doesn't make it for you, just go to visit blockstory.net, Block Story's great website.

B008JFUPK8|3.0|Okay folks... come down to EARTH. This is not the best superhero movie ever and if it is, than that means no other superhero movies had a story. The story is basic as it comes, we have Australian Kryptonians, a Superman who kills, the Air Force opening fire upon a Kansas town with civilians, boring delivery and 9.11 x 15 destruction at the end of the movie just because the creators found a new effect to use. Now... my review.<br /><br />My first and still lingering thought about watching \\"Man of Steel\\" for all of twenty minutes was the overwhelming excitement of watching the capabilities of today's technology. Regardless of what you think of big over the top action movies, when they are done properly, they are breathtaking. We are presently walking into and through a new generation of film that has taken movie experiences to a brand new level. With the addition of 3D, high definition and improvements in sound technology, movies such as \\"Man of Steel\\" can be realized at a level that previous Superman movies could not.<br /><br />That being said, there is also a fine line with that technology that movie makers are still fleshing out; still trying to figure out what is too much and what is not enough. For instance, the effect that showed Superman attacking villains or visa/versa into buildings was pretty cool and it were as if the creators thought so too; so much that they used it too much. Way too much. The ridiculous building destruction at the end of the film was cool once, maybe even twice, but to the extent they took it was not done with common sense or thought of HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED, but \\"this is cool, lets keep doing it\\". The destruction in the finale was laughable. Even if it can be explained, humans would not be so happy about the total desolation of nearly an entire city and catastrophic body count caused by this alien, regardless if he were good or not.<br /><br />I would also like to make one very important suggestion to future movie makers who are filming in 3D; shaky cam and 3D don't mix. Shaky camera is 95% of the time awful anyway.<br /><br />Despite the obvious praises and dissatisfaction with \\"Man of Steel\\" in a technological aspect, its greatest asset may just be its humanity. For once, an action or superhero movie did that part of their movie correctly. Yes, the film is drenched in explosions and destruction, but while they were introducing us to the `Super' of Clark Kent, aka Kal-El, they also introduce us to the man. This was the movies greatest asset. It wasn't the visuals or the ridiculous chaos that ensues toward the end that left a lasting impression on me, it was the connection that Clark Kent has with his parents, played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" is a good movie that was not without fault. The story arch that we are all familiar with moves quickly. Yet, while it succeeded mightily in realizing and portraying the powers of Superman and the personality of Superman, it took many liberties with the story and dragged boringly along with a somber delivery; as if this movie were a tragedy. Throw in dozens of illogical occurrences that I listed earlier and this movie can easily leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The most unforgiving of those is hands down... an inexplicable boredom, despite everything going on.in 3D; shaky cam and 3D don't mix.

0374533555|4.0|This book was written by Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize in economics, despite being a psychologist.  This book is about how we make decisions quickly based on intuition, and only rarely use a more methodical approach to decision making.  According to the author, or more accurately according to a large body of evidence built largely by the author, we don't even realize how are decision making processes work and generally avoid having to think very hard.  This is not an assault on people's intelligence but merely a description of the way we work, as revealed by psychological studies.  Kahneman presents arguments and data that is hard to counter and I have become convinced by his central hypothesis that we are not as good at making decisions as we would like to believe.  This book is generally well written and the author usually introduces a new topic either with a puzzle that was useful in gathering data on a particular hypothesis or by relating an anecdote about how he came to study a topic and who he studied it with.  In fact, the only reason that I don't give this book 5 stars is that sometimes there are a bit too many anecdotes and it can almost seem like the author is the Forrest Gump of psychology because he seems to have been integral in every major discovery for the last 40 or so years.  Still, I really enjoyed this book and it was interesting to gain some insight into the ways that decision making processes occur.

I specially liked the insights into developing a storyboard to build the presentation and the zen design thinking approach to the preparation, design and delivery of the presentations.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Trash in a bag. Is he that arrogant that he does'nt know what his fans want from him? There is not one good track on this short 10 song CD. This is crap. I need a refund.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Flynn thrives on dark, disturbed themes with the voracity off a predator. Then she kindly arranges all the pieces just good enough for a grand finale. Yes, there is redemption and solace, if you just happen to really have earned it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a great game.it makes you use your deduction and puzzle solving skills...the puzzles get more challenging as you go...
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|What can I say? I'm very happy with this little/BIG CPU.<br />I came from an old Dell Inspiron 1520 with a Core 2 Duo T7500 at 2.2Ghz<br /><br />Now, watch movies is a pleasure and play games is an outstanding experience :D<br /><br />Recommended for anybody ;)
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Would like it better if all the friends I added would show up like scats because only being able to visit three a day sucks.
6303567126|5.0|Theres soo many great things I could say about this movie or tell you the whole story but it seams theres a lot of people leaving bad reviews because it wasn't xmen or pirates of the Caribbean, so Im gona start by explaining a lil about what you are getting your self into with this film. 1st Leos best acting, only heath as the joker even comes close to the skills shown in this film. Next if you liked blow, harsh times or what doesn't kill you, you will like this, if you never heard of thouse  movies or didn't like them then this wont be for you. This isn't your standard predictable sports movie where they are down by 20 at half time get a cheeseie speech and they go out and win and the main guy gets the cutest girl in school. This is a true story about a kid that coulda been a state champ and got a scholarship to play at a college had he not gotten kicked out and thrown away his life chasing his next bag. This shows 1st hand what its really like to be a homeless drug using teen. Shows what he goes through his friends his mother, shows some 1 close to him that tries to help but gets burned and even shows what its like after you clean up and change you life around and run into an old using buddy that's still runin and gunin. Shows how easy it is to start out having fun here and there and the next thing you know you through your whole life away and wake up 1 day like how did this happen to me? I related do to my own story of drug use from 14 to 24 so when I see this movie I see me, so that could have a lot to do with why I like it soo much. No other movie comes even close to showing what its really like out there. If you wana see real life drama that will break your heart this is the movie, but if you want Hollywood explosions or happy endings with a story you can always guess whats happening next you might wana stay away from this, a lot of people don't like to see how the other half live and that's fine, but don't bash 1 of the best movies ever cause you have very basic taste in filmsic taste in film
0062255657|5.0|Somewhere, I read a quote of Neil Gaiman that encapsulates what I feel has been his whole career.  He said, \\"Adults need fairy tales too.\\"  Perhaps I am misquoting him, thus is the slippery nature of memory that he explores in his new adult novel, _The Ocean at the End of the Lane_.<br /><br />I had no expectations for what this book would be about before I cracked the spine.  The fact that he had a new book out was enough for me to implicitly trust his imagination and skill in storytelling to but it sight unseen.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Wait, that is a lie.  It's over, and the novelty is gone.  I just finished it though, and I do have to say that this is one of the few books that I've read that I want to turn it over and start from page one again.  I it is thin, only about 180 pages, and Gaiman pulls you along so that those pages only feel like half  the length it actually is.<br /><br />What is the book about though?  It starts out as a relatively realistic novel.  A man returns to a childhood home for a funeral.  While there, he is inexplicably drawn to a house, and the pond at the house.  That's the first eighteen pages.  I thought it was going to be less of a fantasy story than some of his other books at this point, and even then I caught myself looking up from the page and exclaiming to no one in particular that Neil is a very good writer.<br /><br />The first eighteen pages of the unnamed man are just a frame to the story.  Standing at the pond sparks the man's memories of and adventure he had, right after his seventh birthday (as an aside, this part feels like an homage to Lewis Carroll, who's Alice has adventures at about the same age.  I think she was a year younger though). No brief description I can give will do the work justice.<br /><br />What I can say is that Gaiman is a master at capturing a certain sort of childhood.  Some of his most memorable protagonists view the world from about three feet off the ground, in Bod, Coraline, and the main character here. (I realized at page 135 that I didn't know the character's name at all.  I could be remiss, but that seems to be a deliberate choice by the author. There is a point where he is addressed by a nickname, but that is an evil being impersonating his father.)  Gaiman's kids are a mixture of joy and wonder cut deep with a heavy melancholy - I don't know about you, but I can relate to these solitary, bookish boys and girls.<br /><br />And ultimately, that's what makes Gaiman's writing so wonderful and accessible.  The characters are so fully realized, and developed and relatable that no matter what fabulous things happen to them, you are them.  This identification is helped in this book.  It is told in the first person, and the ego is string here.  There is noticeable amount of the first person singular, and the protagonist has some self-awareness, letting the narrative voice say that he saw himself as the most important thing in the universe.<br /><br />Overall, I have to give this book the highest praise.  I just finished it, and I really considered calling in to work so I could read it again and be that child again.  Regrettably, I had to make adult choices.  At least I have my fairy tales.ain character here. (I realized at page 135 that I didn't know the character's name at all.  I could be remiss, but that seems to be a deliberate choice by the author.

B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the movie. The actors were FANTASTIC, especially Jennifer Lawrence. However, I just don't think the movie had the emotional impact of the book. I'm not one of those individuals that always cries, &#34;The book was better!&#34; It's just that, in this instance, I think the book was a 10 out of 10, but the movie was only an 8. For instance, the movie could have easily been another 15-20 minutes longer and included more of a build in the Katniss-Rue and Katniss-Peeta interactions. Katniss's connection to those individuals could have been deeper, as they were in the book, and it would have made the difficult moments in the book far more emotional. (Especially, the cave scene!)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like this it is very fun and u just get to do is put pica in it so I like it alot.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Every song is so beautiful.  When my daughter was in preschool, they used this CD at naptime.  My daughter was so excited when I surprised her with this, and listened to it for several months at bedtime.  Track 7 was the one that she loved the most :)
098357670X|5.0|I love Tom Richmond's caricatures. I'm glad that he has decided to write this book. It is great to be able to learn from the master.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It is the most touching book I've ever read. Truly. It has a wonderful moral and is a book I will never forget. I cried for hours over the death of Beth because Louisa Alcott made it sound so sad, she works magic on words! I love the book and I am so glad I found it for free!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Just when it started to really make me think the game ended. I hope they come out with more rooms yt? o play.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Read this book!!!!  You will not be disappointed.  I am absolutely in love with this book.  The story was amazing and I felt like I was watching it in real life as I read it.  Amazing author.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I really enjoy this game but i don't use the tilt function, i tap the screen to move in the game which i find much easier.<br />Overall it's a fun game if you have a little time to kill
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|I'm not the one who watched it, but kids loved it.  Like the fact that this is a two day rental (48 hours).
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Love this app. It's a great way to get a few minutes of knowledge in whenever I'm free (train, subway, etc.)
B0056TYT66|5.0|I bought this to use with my mother board ASUS P6T Deluxe V2 that has only SATA 2 and USB 2.0. This card works perfectly and makes the mother board new one. Installation is very easy. just put it into a PCI Express slot and connect a SATA 3 (or 2) hard drive. When you turn on computer, you can see the BIOS message of this card that displays the information of hard drives connected to the card after main board BIOS message and you can see the hard drives in main board BIOS and select a hard drive on the card as a boot drive. Very first time, Windows 7 installs the SATA drive of this card automatically but the USB 3 drive should be installed manually after downloading a drive software from the manufacture site. I am using a Segate 3TB usb 3.0 external hard drive and it is working greatly.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|MY FAMILY ENJOY IT AND WE VIEWED IT ALL TOGETHER. Great actors and the quqlity of the dvd is amazing
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Liked the high-energy of all of the tracks on this CD.  Would buy more when they are produced. Can't wait for more.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|This is a great fun game. I live in an place where we loose power a lot and I liked to occupy my time by playing games on my tablet. With Amazons policy of always being connected the games wont play in outages. I would rather pay the .99 cents and buy it from Google Play than get it free with all the snooping that Amazon uses.
B000YEUUCK|4.0|Whether you're a Celine Dion fan or not ( i'm not a fan of hers ), you can enjoy this Bluray. It is jam packed with live music and other extras. I recommend it to anyone that would like to experience what a Las Vegas type show is like or anyone that wants to experience what a good live Vegas concert style show is like.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Was a great app, used it for 2 years. It was updated and now I have to be connected to Amazon to open it. Going back to Google Play to get my apps.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|i watched the Gilmore Girls when they first came to tv.  my daughter bought  me season 1 and i let my mother watch it.  she loved it so i ordered the complete series collection for her.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The only problem I had with the movie was all the (N) word.  I got tired of hearing that, but it was a action packed movie.  A must see.
B00C49H3WI|5.0|I found this show a little hard to attach to during the first two episodes but honestly... there is a lot to attach to.. lots of story to bring forward and many different people played by the same actress. Once I got started I could not stop. I was very pleased to hear that the show had been renewed for a second season. If you have not see it then you are missing out. Fair warning to the more closed minded people... this is an adult themed show and there may be some minor profanity, sex, and violence in any given episode. Its BBC. Its speculative fiction. Its smart, intelligent, and an excellent ride. try it and give it a shot.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I laughed through the whole movie.  I was glad it was over cause at the end my sides hurt. A must see.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best game ever a must have the only thing is u need more characters you have to get its so addicting and fun
B005TBN3EU|4.0|Very entertaining, It was better than the first and its a good time.  I recommend renting this one for sure.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone I met because it has a good suspenseful story that really moves you and can change your perspective on things in life.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was not disappointed like others were about \\"Entwined with You.\\"  I thought it was another good book in the Crossfire Series.  I'm looking forward to book 4 & 5.  She leaves so much more to tell.  I can't wait to see where she goes with it.  For all the people who are disliking it saying they won't read the other books, I'm sure you will.  Don't let us wait that long for the next one!!!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|2013R: This was so lame I actually saw it twice ... how's that for some twisted A Good Day to Die Hard logic? No more twisted than the fact over 40% of reviewers rated this flick 1 or 2 stars, but it still averages a 3 star rating (which BTW is AVERAGE)!<br /><br />In all honesty it didn't totally suck. It was just lame. Here's the list ...<br />-Hot chicks - not enough (but Yuliya's hot AND smart)<br />-Location - average<br />-Storyline - below average<br />-Action sequences - below average (waaaaay to much time on lame car chase)<br />-Soundtrack - below average<br />-Chemistry between leading stars - really sucked<br /><br />Guess that makes it a 3 after all? MFJLabs 2x
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really challenges your thought process and causes you to use different areas of the brain. I highly recommend this game to all ages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|nice thinking game. hope to see more levels in the near future. good way to pass some free time on this rainy day
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This is a fantastic album, proving that Hanson is still going strong almost 20 years after MMMBop. Their sound continually evolves with each record, and this is no exception. There are some really great changes to their sound, but it's still catchy and addicting. Albums like this can introduce them to a whole new world of fans, if only you can get them to listen!
B005FFW46S|5.0|It's Pratchett being insightful and brilliant and funny.  There's really not anything more that needs to be said.  Go Vimes.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Great new take on the music of Superman. Powerful and modern, and fantastic. Highly recommended for fans of Hans Zimmer or the movie.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|I was able to listen to this twice today after I bought it, it's truly a fantastic album. It is much different than Kanye's other albums, but still true to his music and message. The overall feel of the album is pretty dark and straight-forward, and the music and beats are just really interesting. It is for sure a departure, and I'm sure a lot of people won't like it, but I guess I'm a true Kanye fan, because I love it through and through.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it's one that I can actual play, gives someone like me the belief that games can be fun and exciting happy happy me
B009NY43NY|1.0|It was with sadness and frustration that I read the last Sookie Stackhouse novel.  My sadness wasn't so much for the ending of the series (all good things must come to an end) but they way in which Harris wrapped things up.<br /><br />Who Sookie ended up with didn't bother me as much as the way it happened - it felt hurried and poorly executed.  And while it was nice that other characters (like Quinn, for example) got a \\"goodbye\\" in, I was frustrated by the way the plot was woven together - the mastermind of all the evil in the book and the rationale behind his actions was just plain silly.  Frankly, I expected more from Harris.<br /><br />In reading the reviews here, I initially refused to believe the book was that bad.  I was wrong.  _Dead Ever After_ should have been dead on arrival.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Decent flick, but glad it was only 90 mins.  Enjoyed the special effects and action scenes.  Not worth seeing at theater prices but perfect as a digital rental.
1400032717|5.0|This book was so outside the box.  It grabbed my attention from page 1 and never let go.  I loved the first person point of view and I was hooked for the ride the whole way through the novel.  I felt like I had the rare chance to view the world through the eyes of someone with autism.
1603580557|5.0|If you are new to systems thinking, this is a great first book to read.<br />It includes simple explanations of the concepts as well as a broad range of examples from nature, business, politics, and even relationships.<br />The book will make you see the theory in practice all around you and will also provide easy-to-adopt language to share your thinking in systems with others.<br />I'm definitely intrigued and want to explore more books about this fascinating topic.<br /><br />My favorite quotes:<br />\\"A system that can evolve can survive almost any change, by changing itself.\\"<br />\\"We don't talk about what we see. We see only what we can talk about.\\"<br />\\"At the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly, letting go and dancing with the system.\\"
0007456379|3.0|Perfect transaction, but the book is damaged. I don't know if it happened before or during shipment. Too bad for a book of this quality and for its price.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|My family and I loved this more and have been encouraging others to watch it.it is hilarious, and sweet, and beautiful. Story of two opposites and the human ability to improve each other. Very powerful!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game for many years. I am glad it is still here to be enjoyed no matter what medium I use to play it.
B0094ZJK4O|5.0|This is the 1st CD of Richie Samboras<br /> I have ever ordered & I Love it! After reading the reviews, I agree-Mr. Samboras is  not only a talented guitarist, but has a great voice-full of soul.. This is not the Richie Sambora of JBJ fame. This is a man with his own soulful way of writing & singing. If you have never ordered 1 of his cd's, order this 1! The songs will stick in your head. I listen to it over and over,,!Great job, Richie- I look forward to more & more :)
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The first volume was very good, this might be better.  excellent story and story-telling which keeps you interested.  I'd recommend this to anyone loving science fantasy and a deep, involved story with a fascinating lead character.  Sadly, it might be a couple of years before the third volume comes out.  I can't wait.
B00BX8U0EE|5.0|Long out of print this album marked the end of an era for hawkwind.So many what if&#34;s with lemmy out ,a new record lable a new musical direction.excellent remastering on all the discs worth every cent
1455523550|5.0|I liked the stars in the movie. I especially like the male lead. I have seen him in TV often.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|Pretty good app even when you have to pay to get the full version. Sometimes we just need a positive word in the middle of the day.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|I don't think David Garrett is capable of producing anything less than perfect.  I could listen to this all day every day and never get tired of it.  Such wonderful variety and creativity.  A very talented musician.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|There's a grit to this film because there's a grit to real life. Living with a mental/social/psychological affliction sets you apart from &#34;normal&#34; life. It's a sad stigma and one that this film beautifully overwrites. People are broken and relationships are broken, yet in that brokenness, something like &#34;dancing&#34; can mend wounds and bring two lives together.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is a gem and Bradley Cooper shines. Great movie. A+
B003O86MY8|5.0|I listen to this album all the time.  I never get tired of it.  Love the selection, variety and creativity.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Seriously, she's the worst...Anne Hathaway. Am I right? Sadly (or happily?) she is excellent in this decent adaptation of the classic Broadway show. Having seen the original on Broadway with Colm Wilkinson, I've had this show etched on my brain for years and years. There were bound to be disappointments. Hugh Jackman was great at times and then he was clearly out of his element at others. Russel Crowe wasn't nearly as bad as people made him out to be. I forgot how much I liked the song &#34;Stars&#34;. The rest of the cast is adequate.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great film. They did fine justice to the musical.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book was a style first. The author really painted a picture through the short stories of many people. The personal level of each individual was something that you don't see very often in a zombie book or movie. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good apocalyptic scenario or if you want a good,intriguing story.
B00BXN14JO|5.0|Well, this is a fantastic and awsome definitive edition of one of the best Hawkwind's cataloge albums. Warrior of the Edge of Time CD versions were a little-bit issue in terms of edition. The album had been originally released on a separate contract with the original record label and its rights were not held by the great EMI 1996 remasters catalogue. Some labels release the album on CD format, however, even its very acceptable edition and good sound mastered from vinyl, a big gap still existed regarding a definitive remastered and reliable CD edition. I think this complete box set edition fill this problem in terms of getting a well presented album's edition, in both analogue (vinyl with its original design) and digital (LPCM, Dolby Surround and DTS) sound formats; and of course, their awsome graphic and design presentation (photographs, poster, scrapbook, memorabilia) make the product so attractive. Highly Recommended.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|It has been a lot of fun playing this game and easy to play on my Kindle.  I t was a great price too.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The level of reading is very easy. The fact that the books is under 300 pages I could see high school juniors and seniors reading this book. Although the topic is a bit mature for that age.
B009NOVCU6|4.0|There's lots of great Stones music assembled here, with all the obvious choices included. However, it is hard to imagine how they decided to leave out several major must-have tracks (and personal favorites).  Look over the track listing, then proceed with caution before your purchase.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is easy and cool. I kind of got stuck on some levels but its very interesting. the levels could be a little harder and challenging.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This is the best way to charge your Nexus device! I love how the magnets are pretty strong and won't come off easily. You need this if you want to charge your Nexus easily.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is s good game if you like to think. I would recommend it. Unless you like to take the easy way out and cheat that won't do any good because they change the codes around so good luck
B00003CXCW|5.0|What else is there to say about this film? It is an absolute masterpiece! The acting, writing, production! A stunning work of art. Anyone who appreciates &#34;golden&#34; age of cinema, should definitely add Sunset Boulevard to their collection.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford & Suns are a unique blend of Celtic and foot-stomping music.  Their lyric is tender and raucous, and foot thump of the base drum is like a heart beat.  More like this, please.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|My brother-in-law bought this for my grandson, who is in prison. I thought it might be good to read and discuss it with them both. I enjoyed the story and the message that one can learn from most any experience. The desired discussion has yet to happen, but I hope it will. Prison is not a nice place to be, but it can provide a chance to get to know oneself and maybe improve behaviors and thought processes.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is definitely a set of books that I would read all over again. They take a long time to read but they are well worth it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the puzzles. Even my 10 year old son is addicted. Wish their were more puzzles, I am anxious for the updates so I can work on more rooms.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Famke is smoking hot, Love her work. She is awesome in goldeneye and don't say a word.<br />Those eyes damn!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is challenging and fun game.  I can not put it down. it is really a great game. good graphics.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|.Easy to understand and play. No need to use math to play. The first game I played I didn't need to use instructions.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was looking for information about writing an eBook.  This had some very good advise for formatting an eBook which can be easily uploaded to Kindle for publishing.  I would still like to find some specifics about how the sales and royalties work.  But this was an excellent start in the process.
B0071FBARY|4.0|Purchased this after hearing a sample on Amazon. Kind of reminds me of Bryan Adams who I also enjoy listening to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you enjoy figuring out clues to progress to each level you will enjoy this game.  It really requires thought and patience. Very enjoyable and quite possibly addicting.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I bought this book because it follows the same story as &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; series.  I have not finished it yet but what I have read is great!
1439127727|5.0|Intriguing read about the relationships between ex and sitting presidents. I'll recommend it to all political science students.  Thanks Nancy.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I was trying to just use an old folder case that I had but I noticed my Kindle was getting scratched up so I went to Amazon.com and found this case.  I fits perfectly and keeps my Kindle clean and scratch free.  Thank You Amazon!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I often fall asleep during movies these days but the only reason I shut my eyes during this one was for the extremely violent parts (about 3 or 4 times for me!).  A lot of movies are long just for the sake of being long, but this one caught my attention and kept me on the edge of our couch from start to finish.  I am still thinking about it two days later, although warning:  I have been sleeping horribly and having nightmares for the past two nights, as well.  Even though parts of the movie are ridiculously violent (as with many Tarantino films), it is really quite a love story.  I don't want to give anything away - just watch it!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I have watched this movie at least a dozen times now and I see something new each time I watch.  I can't wait for the next one.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you're an Eagles fan, this is a must see, and if you're a music or bio fan, you're really enjoy it.  Lots of vintage concert and behind the scenes footage, plus tons of interviews with all band members.  The production is really done well, and the timeline leaves no stone unturned, taking you back to the very beginning.  I learned a lot about the band, and appreciate their songs even more now.  Stop reading reviews and just buy it, you'll be glad you did.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Despite what the one star reviews say, you do not have to pay in game to play. It is an option if you are too lazy to play through the game. It's a great game, tons of fun. The only issue is that your in app purchases don't transfer, but it is refundable by Amazon! Just go to customer service and tell them it didn't transfer and they will give you your money back.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|this app is just like the real facebook site much better than the facebook app runs smoother and super easy to use 5 out of 5 stars awesome
B00COQKE2M|5.0|Well, a little bit about me, to start. I'm 21 years old, I'm a senior in Petroleum Engineering at UT Austin and have played lead electric guitar for almost 10 years. I have grown up listening to Ronnie's music. Ever since 2007 when I first heard Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, I was hooked. His creative lyrics, his unique vocals (cleans and screams), and his overall \\"f*** any opposition\\" attitude have always inspired me to pursue my dreams in life without hesitation. Anyways, hearing of his departure from Escape The Fate and incarceration in 2008 was really quite saddening. One of the best had truly fallen. To hear of Falling In Reverse in 2009 was quite nice. Most of the music in the \\"scene\\" now just sucks, but Falling In Reverse is an exception. The Drug In Me Is You in 2011 really was a breath of fresh air, and in my opinion, truly rivaled Dying Is Your Latest Fashion.<br /><br />Fast-forwarding to 2013, this sophomore album by Falling In Reverse is no joke. They've changed their style slightly, while still remaining true to their roots... Personally, I say it's Ronnie's best work, but my congratulations doesn't stop with Ronnie. The entire band is incredible. Jacky is one of the best lead guitarists of this decade, Derek's riffs and breakdowns are absolutely brutal, Ryan's machine-gun drumming is almost unbelievable, and Ron's bass-work is quite amazing (especially in Born To Lead). The band still has retained a sense of identity when it comes to the post-hardcore/metalcore/pop punk style. Similar riffs, similar leads, similar breakdowns, similar vocals...<br /><br />Now to analyze the differences: Pick Up The Phone was the closest thing to rap on the previous album (the verse before the chorus or whatever), but this album takes that direction and runs with it. There are five songs with some rap on this album. Frankly, he's very talented at it, and I personally love it. I don't know many rappers that can tear it up like he can. I'm not really into rap, but this isgood. I can see it being an objective hit or miss though... I know haters will hate. It's just a matter of personal taste. Also, a couple songs on the previous album had electronica in them... This album, again, takes that direction and runs with it, as many songs have some electronic influence. Again, it's a matter of personal taste. I think the electronics are well-done. Then again, some will hate.<br /><br />All in all, I don't think it's a truly radical departure from their previous work. It's just their style taken to the next level... Those who paved the future are those who took a risk...and Falling In Reverse are paving the future.<br /><br />Here's a song-by-song analysis:<br /><br />Champion: 10/10 - This song is absolutely brutal. It's heavy as f***. It reminds me of Don't Mess With Ouija Boards from their previous record. The only difference is a 40-second rap bridge right before the breakdown. The rap is ridiculously fast, and it never fails to blow my mind. The lyrics are pretty cool too.<br /><br />Bad Girls Club: 5/10 - Haha, I gotta say, I'm more of a metalhead, so this song...ehhh, it just doesn't do it for me. Objectively, it's a good song and I guarantee you, it will be popular. Not my style, but I respect it for what it is. Don't take my 5/10 rating as truth, because it's just an opinion.<br /><br />Rolling Stone: 10/10 - Again, another absolutely brutal song. I love it. This has another small (really fast) rap part with some dubstep included in the breakdown. Being a fan of dubstep, this song never fails to blow me away.<br /><br />Fashionably Late: 10/10 - This sounds like The Drug In Me Is You, pt. 2... It's so good, it's a fantastic pop punk anthem of infidelity. Not that deep, lyrically, but nevertheless, it's a fun song :)<br /><br />Alone: 8/10 - Ehh, this song is what sparked all the crazy controversy... Frankly, I like it a lot. The rap is a little too much for me in this one, but whatever, because the breakdown won me over. It's a pretty badass song, and I feel like it's gonna pave a new future for this genre of music. His lyrics are a little...uhhh... Not my favorite. It's okay though. Great song :)<br /><br />Born To Lead: 20/10 - Best song on the album. It's heavy as f***. The lyrics are motivational and the overall performance of every band member is at a maximum. This song gives me chills. It inspires me so much, and if I ever make my dreams come true, I will cite this song as an influence.<br /><br />It's Over When It's Over: 10/10 - This song reminds me of Cellar Door from Dying Is Your Latest Fashion... It's got a little bit of rap and some electronica mixed in though. It's very well done. The lyrics, again, are badass. Very inspiring, and almost tragic.<br /><br />Game Over: 3/10 - I don't even want to talk about this song. Then again, you might like it... Don't take my opinion as absolute truth. I imagine this song will gain a cult following... Honestly, it isn't my cup of tea, though. It's not like it's a bad song. It's just... I don't even know :P<br /><br />Self-Destruct Personality: 10/10 - This song is badass. It's like Goodbye Graceful from their previous record. It was a sick rap portion in it as well, but it's concise and to the point. Love it!<br /><br />F*** The Rest: 9/10 - This sounds like Four Year Strong or A Day To Remember... It's so awesome... I like the lyrics a lot in this song too. The breakdown is my favorite part.<br /><br />Keep Holding On: 9/10 - A motivational power ballad... An anthem to the downtrodden... It's yet another lyrical epic. It inspires me to continue forward despite anyone or anything. This breakdown is epic as hell, too. Great song!<br /><br />Drifter: 7/10 - This is like a Hawaiian-country-punk song... It's kinda weird... I like it though. It's a continuation of the whole The Day I left The Womb/The Westerner story arc. You get a glimpse into Ronnie Radke's hardships in life.<br /><br />Where Have You Been: 10/10 - This song is heavy as f***...I love it. No rap. Nothing but amazingness. This honestly should have replaced Game Over on the record, but that's just me.<br /><br />Goddamn: 10/10 - This is so much like A Day To Remember. I love this song. I think it's a song a lot of us young people can relate to. I know I can. The guitar and riffs are amazing. Heavy, but no screaming. Great song! Should have replaced Bad Girls Club or Drifter, but again, that's just me.<br /><br />Rolling Stone Remix: 5/10 - It's fun. I don't really count this as a song though... It's just dubsteb and that's really it. I like it, but I just don't see the point of even putting this on the record.<br /><br />All in all, this record is a great summer release, and I know I'll be listening to it a lot in these upcoming weeks. Hate it, love it, who even cares? It's just a CD. For me, though, it's a little more than a CD. It's a story... It's a symbol... It's an idea... It's a message that says \\"Don't ever stop believing in yourself\\". This guy has been through a lot, and here he is today, doing what he loves... If he can do it, why can't I? Without enough willpower and motivation, anything in life is possible.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo's Reef is an improvement over some of Disney's other games where in app purchases are almost required to progress. Making a pearl purchase is helpful but Nemo would still be fun without.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book captures you and takes you on a ride. You think you know what happened but you have bias towards the defendant. And then things seem to return to normal, but a tragedy strikes again and changes people's minds about guilt and innocence. It's a great mystery for mystery lovers.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My husband is a Star Wars fan, I like Angry Birds, so what a perfect blend of the two.  He plays this a lot more than me, I have a tendency to give up to easily and hand the Kindle off to him to figure the game out.  He loves it, hard to get him to stop.

B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love it, its a really great game, but i wish it wasnt so...buggy. i dont know, it errors out a lot, and i think gameloft should fix that, as well as add more gamemodes, and make it easier to play with friends.
1423140591|4.0|I gave this as a gift for my nephew, he loves the Percy Jackson series so I think that he would like this one too.
0765348276|5.0|Having just finished the WoT series with a great many other fantasy lovers the world over, I didn't know if I could ever start another epic arc of books again. (Much less Space SciFi Books)  Really enjoyed this book and look forward to &#34;The Ghost Brigades&#34;<br /><br />Cheers.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|I am not a big gamer, so I kind of got a little bored with this one.  I am not saying its a bad game, but for me, I lost interest pretty quick.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A great read as usual lots of twists and turns.  A real page turner.  Hope he uses this character again

B00BTYP6QE|3.0|I got this game for my Kindle, its really cute, not too difficult to play, especially since I am not really a big gamer, kids will like it and husbands too.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I had been waiting what felt like forever to see how the story would end for Eva and Gideon , so disappointed in this book so many things left hanging at the end it just felt like I was cut off reading the middle of a story. I thought there were only 3 books ?? Yet it was left hanging like that ? I enjoyed the first and second book but this one just felt like filler. I don't know what that's about, it feels like this was just dragged out to get another book out of it. if there is another book to  follow I hope there is more substance to it. I got sick of reading the amount of sex scenes in this one over and over again there is only so much filler you can take in one book. I kept waiting for something shocking to happen to get to the \\"story\\". But it never happened ....
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I have read the book, movie not really what I thought it could have been.  My daughter and I have read the series, and we both agreed that the movie's cast was not exactly how we pictured them and the southern accents, oh please, they were so awful.  I am SOUTHERN and I have to say, it was way over the top, I have never met anyone who talked that badly with a strong southern like attempt at an accent.  Jeremy Irons was the only one that didn't irritate the mess out me, beside I just think he is the absolute bomb, speak to me Jeremy, say my name.  Okay, well, the movie, it was okay, not great like it could have been, but just okay.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A great leap in storytelling skill from his already wonderful first 2 books.  Complex, moving and overall, magnificent.  Magnificent stories within stories. Highly recommended.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|We gave her a Kindle for Christmas, she loved it, so naturally, she needed to put things on it.  From what I hear, I am a pretty cool aunt.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a book I wish I had 25 years ago when I started my career.  But, it never could have been written until now.  Do not be fooled.  Many who criticized this book never read it.  It is realistic, highly personal and practical for men and women.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show, it is so funny and smartly written.  I just love the way that they are so smart, yet nerdy and naïve all at the same time.  Love this show.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Cruise is the last person I would have chosen to be Reacher. Reacher is suppose to be 6'5' and 230 pounds of all muscle. As a former Army Military Police, we are lead to believe that he is the ultimate in brain power too. Usually there is one sexual scene and then he leaves the woman at the end. He doesn't want to stay in one place, and he likes to carry money and a tooth brush.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Its a good action film, a little gory in some places.  Scary witches and Trolls, lots of quick gory scenes, bad guys that should have been good, Troll squishes them, actually cheered at that part.  Good wins and Jeremy Renner is a cutie pie, plus he kicks witches butt really good.
B0012GMUSQ|5.0|I ordered this cd a few days ago and BAM!!! it her already. Case was cracked but cd was in great condition. I have been a fan of this band since my kids mom turned me on to this band.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Love Dr. Seuss, grew up with his books and now they are making them into movies.  Very well done, loved it.  Behind the cuteness of the movie there is a lesson, I hope people take heed, its important.  Kids will love it and I think they will also &#34;get it&#34; as well.
B000NA77YO|4.0|I am a fan of Ronnie James Dio, and I wanted to buy all the cd's with him in Black Sabbath, but that would cost me and arm and a leg. But I found this cd on Amazon and I just had to get it. It was at a good price and it shipped to my place very quickly.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I find Mahjong very addicting, before I know it, I have spent hours playing.  So I guess I have to say that I really, really like this game.  I will not say I love it, because I find myself wasting time playing the game when I could have been doing something else, like I don't know, cooking dinner.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|My brother plays the games and I was very excited about this movie when it came out, it wasn't what I expected but still good because I knew the games.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Loved the Bourne series, this movie followed along where the last Bourne movie was going, you just saw Renner's character side of things.  I really like the way they did this, it was very well done, lots of action, kind of left it open for possibly more to follow.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is great for hours of enjoyment. I enjoy at 34 years old and our daughter enjoys it at 6 years old.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|My daughter and I are huge Dr. Who fans, it is one of the few sci-fi shows that I actually will watch over and over again.  My kid got me hooked, so I am blaming her.  Just love it.
0345525558|5.0|This is such an incredible book. It is so well written that I don't want it to end. Victoria is an complex character, but I couldn't help but like her.
B009PAETCG|4.0|The game overall was great. The graphics were also very good too. My only flaw in this game was that when I lost a game it would always freeze . And that is my only problem with this game.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This little game will fool you into thinking it is all easy but it can be devilishly challenging at times. You find yourself trying all sorts of combinations to reach that perfect 3 star score as you advance and some of the established buildings in a level can act as red herrings so you have to strategize your game play. I have achieved a perfect score on the three islands that I have completed thus far but I had to repeat the levels to earn that score so I really feel like I accomplished something,  lol. This game is quite engaging to those who like a puzzling challenge.
0307476073|5.0|Towards the beginning of this memoir, Cheryl Strayed describes herself as a woman with a hole in her heart. She is reeling from the death of her mother and is untethered and acting out in ways that are painfully harmful to herself. She is cheating on her husband who she loves, experimenting on a regular basis with heroin (even intravenously), and having sex with men she hardly knows. She waits tables and tries to save as much money as she can. She is also trying to keep her sister and brother close to her but this doesn't work once her mother has died. Her beloved stepfather changes after her mother's death and is no longer close to Cheryl and her siblings. Though her mother's death is untimely, Cheryl grieves in a way that only sabotages herself until she gets this idea - to walk the Pacific Coast Trail.<br /><br />The Pacific Trail runs from Mexico to Washington and Cheryl decides to hike it from California to Oregon, alone and in solitude. She gears up at REI but her pack is huge and she finds it difficult to even stay erect with it on her back. She ends up calling it 'Monster'. Her shoes are too small and her toe nails start falling off. The book is about Cheryl's journey on the trail and her journey to find herself, to become the woman she wants to be - self-sufficient, healthy, loving and whole. While on the trail she meets several people who are kind to her and help her on her journey. She also meets one scary couple of guys who she manages to outrun.<br /><br />I found this book fascinating and really rooted for Cheryl all the way. Her last name, 'Strayed', is one that she picked out for herself and it is so apt for Cheryl has strayed the path that she once thought she was on. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read. Though it is a memoir, it reads like a page-turner and is fascinating throughout. Cheryl has wonderful insight and is never maudlin. She is tough on herself and honest about her life.

B005F3XV62|5.0|Funny!! One of the better movies I've seen!! A great family movie night movie!! Kevin James was a great choice for this movie!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter wanted to call her review &quot;Great for Everybody! &quot;  She's five, and she loves it - but she needs help to play it.  Also, make sure your parental controls are enabled!  It's WAY too easy for little ones to spend real money in this game!
B003Y5H574|5.0|Fantastic! I loved the movie and have watched it at least 5 times since I bought it. Well written and full of twists :)
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I love this cd. It has all their best songs, and a few others thrown in. If you love the Beach Boys, buy it.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|During the album's streaming stages, I joined in on the listen due to my lack of patient discipline. Upon first listening through my laptop speakers I was prepared to give this album a four-star rating. I felt that the album was a solid Sigur Rós album that kept in line with what they have been doing thus far, but it did not blow me away. When I finally received my copy, though, I learned that it was the subtleties that really make a difference between a great record and a really great record: I was unable to pick up on certain aspects through inferior speakers. So now I will provide a five-star review instead.<br /><br />The band mentioned soon after the album's beginnings that they were nodding back to their glory days of the brooding, enigmatic sound that foreigners couldn't stop talking about. This excited me as [[ASIN:B003YM32GA Agaetis Byrjun]] and [[ASIN:B00006LLNU Sigur Rós]] are indeed my favorite records from the band. It would be very difficult for me to not like any of their albums post [[ASIN:B0002SVW3O Von]], so the influence of my darker sound bias is quite minimal. But there's something about those second and third records that truly grip me. However, I didn't find 'Kveikur' in that same grouping at all.<br /><br />While the album does reminisce a bit with e-bow prominent melodies at times, a very important fact to keep in mind is that the album is its own distinguished work. True, there are obvious intentions of returning to minimalist sounds from brass and strings, the obvious example being 'Hrafntinna' in its closing moments, which throw us back quite beautifully into 'Ný batterí' in its opening portion. But 'Stormur' sounds like it could have come from the [[ASIN:B001ACY8D2 Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust]] days in its jubilee. This style juxtaposition led me to believe that this album is not merely a nod to one past Sigur Rós incarnation but all. It contains everything that the band is and has achieved to date. That is an impressive feat. But they are still not afraid to experiment with their own identity. 'Hrafntinna' contains some truly impressive vocal melody with beautiful crescendos. Not to mention that the percussion is fantastic. But the main point of that song, for me, is hearing Jónsi croon his falsetto in tones I hadn't heard from him before.<br /><br />You do not have to dig far into the silt of 'Kveikur' to appreciate different aspects and portions of the album. There is bombastic extravagance to meditative ambience. And for those of you who associate the group with the infamous 'Post-Rock' label, these sound morphs are not presented in the clichéd crescendo ebbs that the genre is known for. This stuff is flawless. The album is for all fans, I would say. It will not disappoint.
B009KKLQVS|5.0|I loved watch this dvd. Only thing is, I wish it was the whole show. It was only half. I just saw Mike Love and Bruce Johnson a couple of weeks ago at Casino Morongo in Cabazon Ca. If you are a Beach Boy fan, take a look.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love end of the world books, and have read quite a few.  This was different than the others in all the best ways.  I found it difficult to put this book down, and am glad I decided to pay to try it.  I can't wait to try more of this author's books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was fairly predictable but the ending was not. I,too lost my first wife to illness and found another woman to love. Although at a much later age the story hit home. Well done and a pleasure to read.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Could feel every emotion with each of the characters. it was an experience to be able to rationalize  suicide is a different way.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|Armin van Buuren does it again!! This time he added more vocals to his music but still another great masterpiece by Armin!!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|its very entertaining but way too short needs more rooms. not too hard not too easy. if it was longer it could be sold but for now it needs to be free overall awesome game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great little game. It's not an easy one though. Definitely a challenge but a fun one. You must be good with a touchpad. Quick with your hand and good at solving realtime puzzles. It helps if you're good at observing the periphery, too. Give it a try!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun you should get it it's addictive but still very fun good child game and it you rate it you get three free gems
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I missed two of my favorite movies trying to get out of each room.  It was a lot of fun searching for the clues!!
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This movie is hilarious. So politically incorrect and I love it. Great casting and outlandish plot make for a fun movie to watch.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|First of all, we ( my Husband and I) love Denzel so we always expect a great movie when he is involved but I personally wasn't prepared for such a gripping(and harrowing) film . The opening (and as it turns out pivotal ) scenes had me shaking (I actually started to cry -I'm a chick) but it's what happens through-out the movie that is powerful and moving. We humans take so much for granted, we squander our chances for love, to do &#34;right&#34; etc... I don't want to give the movie away so I'll just say it is the story of one man's arrogance, comeuppance defeat and ( maybe) redemption! If you're looking for an &#34;action&#34; movie this isn't it , you will however be shaken and (maybe ) moved to examine your own heart and life.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Can not get enough of it. Just like the cdc and the models they use. Can't wait to get the next levels
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was an awesome book!  Very moving and intense !  I would totally recommend it! A great love story to the end!
0307352153|5.0|As an investment advisor, I'm pretty unique. I don't have a sparkling personality or ability to work a crowd for business advantage. Truthfully, if I needed sales skills to feed myself, I'd have been a starvation statistic decades ago.<br /><br />Susan Cain wrote Quiet, and it's all about introverts in our society. It's revealing and helpful and comforting to those of us so afflicted. Well, maybe afflicted isn't the right word; persecuted feels closer to the mark. From grade school to church to work, Americans seem to prize big and outgoing personalities. Cain shares the reasons why, and provides plenty of good examples to prove her point.<br /><br />The better news is that she offers other examples showing a different kind of leadership and success. It turns out that 30-50 percent of the population enjoys reading and solitude and small groups, rather than large. They tend to feel things strongly, think deeply, and contribute mightily. Still, they create from behind a quieter demeanor and sometimes go unnoticed by people around them. She names some names and it's a stellar group with outsized influence on our lives.<br /><br />It turns out that you don't have to be loud or talkative to be good.<br /><br />I've lived this bias for years. In fact, one former colleague chastised me by complaining \\"you'd rather sit at your computer writing then go out and network with people.\\"<br /><br />\\"Maybe so,\\" I answered, \\"but that's what got us to where we are today.\\" And it's so true. Little of our business comes from networking. Much of our business comes from people who have read my earlier work, or referrals from others who know about it. The substance of my ability is far more important than a loud or outgoing personality.<br /><br />That colleague is gone now, but my computer and writing continues. My business continues to grow at a remarkable pace. It turns out that clients are smart enough to see what matters and what doesn't. Small talk at a chamber of commerce mixer isn't all that important to folks with large investment portfolios. God bless them for this because I might starve otherwise.<br /><br />Susan Cain helped me understand why introversion is okay. Why reading is okay. Why quiet is okay. Why thinking is okay. I'm exceedingly grateful to her.

B007RI56NY|5.0|Love, love, love the new album! I can't say it enough but Train just gets better with each new album. As always they did not disappoint with this one. It has a nice mix of fun, catchy songs with more serious or intense ones (at least for me). I completely relate to &#34;This'll be my year,&#34; mainly because I'm old enough to remember all the events listed. Plus my 10yr old's favorite song is &#34;Fifty ways to say good-bye,&#34; yes I know I'm probably a bad parent for that one, but he loves it (and completely understand the meaning of the song). This is one of those of albums that you just have to take with you on a road trip, because you can't helping singing along to all the songs out loud. Anyway, great album all around!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Downloaded the app. It does what it has to do but less than if you would go on a desk or laptop. But it serves it's purpose.
B00B7364H2|5.0|Classical audiophiles over a certain age will fondly remember Mercury Living Classics LPs. I am not part of that generation, but I vividly recall putting an old Mercury LP on the turntable (\\"recorded on 35MM magnetic film\\", the label boasted) back in the 1980s. I put my headphones on, and was blown away, thinking \\"What, this was recorded in the 1960s? How did they get it to sound this great?\\"<br /><br />\\"Simplicity is wisdom\\" is a succinct way to describe Mercury's approach to recording. Build top notch recording equipment, select the right microphones, find the best placement - and get out of the way while the performers do their thing. To an extent, this was also the approach used by RCA during their Living Stereo heyday. Mercury went RCA one better by hauling a customized truck with their recording equipment wherever they went - even to Moscow. But by the time Mercury had stopped making records, RCA had lost its way in the confusion of multi-miking, and it wasn't until the early digital era that Telarc resurrected Mercury's guiding principles. This is, along with its companion volume, the best sounding pre-digital boxed set you're going to hear, and some of these recordings still sound better than their digital descendants.<br /><br />For a smaller label working on a tight budget, Mercury built an admirable roster of artists including conductors Howard Hanson (also a composer), Antal Dorati, and Rafael Kubelik, organist Marcel Dupre, harpsichordist Rafael Puyana, and cellist Janos Starker. Many of the performers were attracted to Mercury by the opportunity to pick which repertoire to record, rather than having it assigned to them by A & R.<br /><br />Much of that repertoire leans toward the middle-brow. This is not the set for those who rely on Bruckner and Mahler for their daily sustenance. There are established masterwork staples, such as Beethoven's 5th, 6th, and 7th Symphonies, and Dvor&aacute;k's 7th, 8th and 9th Symphonies. There's also a lot of worthy off the beaten track music to be heard here including four complete ballet scores, works by American composers, and a generous helping of 20th Century music from Berg, Webern, and Schoenberg to Stravinsky and Bartok - and the world premiere recording of Corgliano's Piano Concerto.  Often, the program concepts showed an imagination seldom seen on the big labels: two discs entitled Music for Quiet Listening, military music, pops-concert fare, an album of Marches, and good old \\"sonic spectaculars\\" like Saint-Saëns' \\"Organ\\" Symphony, and Respighi's Pines and Fountains of Rome.  There is relatively little solo instrumental music, aside from three discs of harpsichord music, an organ recital, and one disc of chamber music.<br /><br />I won't go into detail about these performances except to note that many show an inspiration seldom heard on the big labels. Although recorded under studio conditions, many sound like live performances caught on the fly.  In many ways, these are the kinds of performances we might have heard if advanced recording technology existed during the 78RPM era: not the most polished, but always compelling attention.<br /><br />Most of the discs are generously filled.  The exception is disc 54 which contains Dorati's first of three recordings of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring in monaural sound - the best of its kind I've ever heard. Some may quibble at the inclusion of this and several other mono recordings, but it's fitting since the Living Presence name was coined by a music critic who reviewed these early recordings.  As for the stereo recordings which make up the majority of the set, the sound is remarkably consistent: a strong center, with a discreet sense of separation at the left and right, immediate without sacrificing hall ambiance.  The dynamics are wide as Mercury engineers didn't alter the settings once an initial volume test was run.<br /><br />The set, which features the original LP front covers, comes with a generous and informative booklet. If the interest in this set matches that of volume one, it will sell like hotcakes - so snap it up while you can.interest in this set matches that of volume one, it will sell like hotcakes - so snap it up while you can.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|I have downloaded this game on both my Android tablet and Kindle Fire and it does not work. Big Disappointment
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Having read this story at least 10 times over the years, this movie lives up to the legend...., it is really faithful to the primary plot points, the actors are excellent in each of their roles...  .  It is thrilling to see it brought to life on the big screen & it truly deserves a sequel, so long as they do not cut back on the production value.  This movie is a real triumph.
0062059963|5.0|OMG this book was soooo AMMAZING! I love Kiera cass and she writes the best books. The selection was really good and the elite was EVEN better. I couldn't stop reading the book and it is simply awesome!! MUST MUST MUST MUST get.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was a skeptic.  Now, I use it on a regular basis for relaxation, sleep, and concentration.  At night, I just set the timer for it to automatically kick off.  I highly recommend this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love because it's trying to escape and I like those kind of games. I can't even stop playing it.
B00000DCHI|3.0|The song are great, but since the songs are old, the quality is bad. Also while I was playing one of the CDs in my car, a song suddenly screeched and ever since then, that song doesnt play anymore.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I can't recall a time a zombie movie that wasn't filled with blood and gore made me smile, but \\"Warm Bodies\\" sure did. Far more than a quirky love story, this is a story that is ultimately about compassion. While the movie drags its feet for the first half-hour (pun intended) I realized as the story progressed and R's character developed, that the resulting pace with which the movie moves is quite deliberate. Quite frankly, it's almost genius. My only qualm is that John Malcovich, as Julie's father, is terribly under-utilized in this movie. That much is forgiven in light of Rob Cordrey, who does more with being a zombie than you think he could given his limited acting ability. And that's all I'll say because the less you know going into this movie, the greater the pay-off will be. Entirely more satisfying than \\"Zombieland,\\" \\"Warm Bodies\\" adds a welcome new wrinkle to the zombie genre.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I got this app to listen to a podcast, and it turned out better that I expected! There's hardly any lag and thousands of songs!
B00B10DZQE|5.0|love this movie!! great story and even better that its based on a true story! get your tissues out though cause you just might cry. highly recommend for the whole family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was different than other Nicholas Sparks books I've read. The danger grabbed your attention, causing you to never stop reading. The love Katie and Alex displayed was truly magical and the character's personalities were brilliant!
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|you definitely have to pay attention to this one and you may want to watch it again to put the pieces all together. It's a great portrayal of lifetime soul connections and how we can grow and evolve. highly recommend!
B00BF11STU|2.0|I watched about an hour one evening and when I went back to watch the next night the movie was still on my Watchlist but it said I had to pay 12.99 for it.  I didn't want to pay that for something I wasn't enjoying much anyway.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think it is a book every couple should read after their second year of marriage. It changed the concept I had about love and how to maintain love. Unfortunately I read it too late, however it made me realize what went wrong with my relationship, but now I am in peace.

0061692042|5.0|For years I have avoided Richard Ford, gripped by a vague notion that he wrote bourgeois \\"man fiction\\" that would have no relevance to me. But a few paragraphs of \\"Canada\\" hooked me, and I'm very glad I made the buy. Ford creates an absorbing world, rich with detail of landscape, culture, history and piercing glimpses of the lives of a range of human and even animal characters. Ford manages to make his world both familiar and dauntingly strange at the same time.<br />The pace is measured and the book's denouement is a disappointment -- some characters are more far eloquent in their absence. But in all this is a great read and will truly transport you.
B006M3JVD6|4.0|It is a quick read, difficult topic, must have been hard to write - yet author keeps it from being too horrendous and at the same time gives an understanding
B0033AGPG2|5.0|I wish that all the albums released after Jimi died were as great as this one. This is the album Cry Of Love should have been if Warners in their greed hadn't tried to wring every last cent out of the man & stretched these songs over 3 uneven albums, 2 of which were padded with filler. That the songs are great is a given but the vinyl pressing sounds wonderful -crisp, sharp, full sounding without a hint of surface noise on 180 gram. Audio paradise. It is too bad that the other releases of the past 25 or so years weren't this well assembled. If they had taken the actually unreleased songs as opposed to mostly just unreleased takes, sometimes just given different names, sprinkled with a few unheard songs Jimi's legacy would have been better served, saving the alternate versions for a boxed set.
B004KKX814|5.0|it is way better than Hasbro hyperblades because of those crazy colors hate those because are fake beyblades takara tomy Is better
B000006IUQ|5.0|The Edge is a really great action adventure film.  Charles Morse, entrepreneur and self made billionaire (Anthony Hopkins) goes on a photo shoot in Alaska with his wife, Mickey, (Elle McPherson) a model and her photographer \\"friend\\" Robert Green (Alec Baldwin).  Elle suggests that Charles go off on a quest with Green to get the perfect classic 19th century photograph.  Charles does not know that Green plans to kill him, steal his wife and grab his money.  Mickey remains back at the lodge with John Styles (L.Q. Jones) a squirrely outdoorsman and builder of the lodge, while Charles, Bob and another man (Harry Perrineau) fly off into the bush to get their photographs.  The aircraft runs into a flock of geese (birdstrike) and they crash in a remote lake. It is there they meet Bart, the bear, who wants to eat them and partly succeeds.<br /><br />The rest of the movie revolves around escaping from the bear, Bob attempting to murder Charles, and a return to civilization.  Charles has the astounding gift of not being stumpted by any question.  He has read a book on wilderness survival and uses the information to help them survive in this unforgiving land.<br /><br />The film was very well made, the acting by Hopkins and Baldwin superb.  And, Oh Yeah, the bear was good too.  I enjoyed the film.  I think it will one day become a classic.
B0014DCTCY|4.0|Danger Mouse and the Black Keys put together a very enjoyable record. Like that this LP came with a CD. Good quality record.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|Late in the 20th century, the Thermian High Command had intercepted earth's Historical Documents accidently beamed into space.  With this knowledge, they were able to recreate the NSEA Protector, a highly advanced interstelar space craft crewed by Commander Peter Quincy Taggart (Tim Allen), Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver), Dr. Lazarus (Allen Rickman), Fred Quan (Tony Shalhoub), and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell).  Having squid-like bodies in real life, they were forced to take on a more human like appearance to operate the controls.<br /><br />Sarris, a reptilian villain, has been making life miserable for the Thermians and has killed many of them.  In order to save their world, their commander, Mathesar seeks earth's assistance.  He finds Taggart and begs his help.  Mathesar, as well as all the Thermians believe the\\"Historical Records\\" are real.  They don't know the meaning of the word deception.  They do not know that Taggart and the whole Protector crew are only actors and that the real Protector is a ship 6 in. long. Thinking this a stunt and possibly a gig for the retired actor, Taggart  agrees to board their ship.  He soon realizes this is no gig and that Sarris is painfully real.  Taggart convinces other members of the old TV sci-fi series to help the Thermians in their fight for survival.<br /><br />The entire film is a spoof on the Star Trek series.  It is funny and serious at the same time.  But, worth mentioning, it does not impugn Roddenberry's classic work.  More likely, it glorifies it.  Allen, Weaver, Rickman and Shalhoub give outstanding performances in the film and carry the predictable plot. It is an enjoyable movie that all Star Trek and sci-fi fans should enjoy.  Idid!
B0053FANPY|1.0|I have ordered DVDs from Amazon for years and never had a problem, but as soon as I ordered this series, I had a problem. This single DVD of the original FF movie was defective as well. So, I have all of the other 4 movies but not the original.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great entertainment for a low price. The graphics and details were fabulous. Very unique and different from any other puzzle game I've played before.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've really enjoyed using this ap.  For instance I don't have a clock at my desk so I will leave this on all day.  Also I can set the timer to make sure I return from lunch on time.  This is also my morning alarm and I app recite that I can set the sound I wish to be wakened up to.  There are several things I use this ap for and found it to be money WELL spent.  Great app and again well worth the money east.
1423136802|5.0|I've always liked Greek mythology and these put a great spin on it. Its a great way to learn and enjoy it there aren't any real slow parts of the books they cover the emotional spectrum very well. Comedy abounds all in all great books for all ages
B0091REZMW|1.0|This was recommended to me.  I was able to play when I first downloaded it.  Although that took a very long time.  When I try to replay it will not open.  I have deleted and tried over and over.  Too bad.  It was fun to play.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I had a feeling this movie was going to be good, but it's more than good, it is GREAT.<br /><br />I have been disappointed with many movie prequels, but this is not one of them!<br /><br />Everything about the movie is wonderful.  The cast, the story line, and the incredible graphics is breath taking.<br /><br />This is &#34;must see&#34; movie, even if you have never seen The Wizard Of Oz.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I think Chris and everyone who contributed to this auto-biography did an excellent job. It provides insight to the public about the War on Terror and gives thought and appreciation to those who are considering a military career.

B0001CCY7E|5.0|My favorite movie soundtrack!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an enjoyable book I didn't want to put it down.  It was somewhat predictable but it exposed the personal tragedies that led the characters to where current situations. Would recommend.
074401493X|2.0|The guide is good, but it's full of spoilers. And what's obnoxious about the spoilers is they are completely unnecessary. In my humble opinion, there's nothing in the guide that's worth ruining any aspect of such a great story, so use it at your own risk.
0425263924|3.0|First off, I was upset that this book was supposed to be released 6  months ago and wasn't.  But I  love both Gideon and Eva,  so I was excited to start reading a  few days ago.  As the book went on  though,  it became clear that things weren't really going anywhere.  With about 30 pages  left, I  began to panic because it wad clear that there weren't enough pages  left to tie up the loose ends.  Why should we care about Corrine's  drama?  What was Cary  going to do about his situation?  Why did Eva  have a confrontation with  Gideon's  mom?  Who moved the bracelet?  And for the love of God,  why wouldn't Megumi  answer the phone? I  didn't even really care at that point,  but it was supposed to be a trilogy,  and I was  looking for answers. I also felt like Eva  and Gideon's  relationship  had become extremely redundant and even more insecure since the marriage.  The whole thing was disappointing. I  feel trapped,  because I loved the first two books and obviously want to see the story through,  but that's exactly what Day and her publisher are banking on,  which weakens her as a writer  and gives a bad name to the series.  Are they going to drag these next two books out over another few years?  Because I  highly doubt I'll still care at that point.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|best  album great  production and really athentic  songs like powertrip i  like all the songs starting from the intro to the outro  but to top it off really really great album
B000E1YW0E|5.0|i love this movie so much and with the deleted scenes it shows more of the background of the story along with one of my favorite songs!! if i could i would give it over 5 stars! you are missing out if you do not buy this!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have read all the books in this series and enjoyed them immensely until I hit the end of this book. She wrote 3/4ths of a book and just ended it. Very disappointed.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I still I am so lost on playing this game! I wish there was a tutorial on how to play it! I guess I will figure it out.
B0024FAG6M|5.0|Old school biking, with old school drinking, partying, sex, and violence, some of the best early 70's music ever produced..  Everything I thought I wanted as a guy just graduating from high school when I saw this film on the big screen.  I've had a long life journey since then, and when Fonda says to  Hopper &#34;We blew it man&#34; I really understand what that means now.  Drugs and alcohol have been a real dredge on our society, much glorified starting in the  60s and early 70s as everyone was trying to wrap their head around the Vietnam era and the draft.  This movie gives you a real picture of that era even though the war is never mentioned.  It also gives a good analgy of what people hold on to even today as 'Freedom.'  Captain America and Billy.  Lost souls in a lost time, in a lost place, makes for one hek of a good movie.  Especially for nostalgia lovers of the 60s and 70s.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Awesome game but definitely needs easier ways to get coins to buy items and evolve dinosaurs! It's becoming annoying never having enough money to do anything :/
0670026603|5.0|I don't know what to say.<br />I usually listen to audio books on my commute. So when Friday evening came, and I found myself sitting in my car in my driveway, with still half the audiobook to listen to, I decided to go inside and listen to \\"just one more chapter.\\"<br /><br />Which turned into a very late night of me laying on my bed, staring up at the ceiling. Before dinner. After dinner. And finally, with my husband asleep next to me and the lights out, until 2am, when I finally finished Me Before You. And was a hysterical blubbering mess.<br /><br />I cannot say enough wonderful things about this book.<br />I met friends for a fun Saturday afternoon the next day and they remarked upon how puffy my eyes were and how I looked very tired. Which of course then I had to explain to them why I was up all night, a sobbing crazy person.<br /><br />Lou seems content with her small life, her simple existence. Will's life was bigger, brighter, fun and in motion. They couldn't be more different and that's why their middle ground is so unstable. But coming from each side, both of these characters have a journey ahead of them through struggles and hardship and love that alter them so completely, my heart warms just thinking about who they were in Chapter One and who they became by the end.<br /><br />This is not Chick Lit. It is not a conventional romance.<br />It is way more than that.<br />It's a deep and thought provoking read about courage, living and love.<br /><br />I listened to the well read audiobook and highly recommend it.<br />I also fear that reading the book would have been very difficult for me as I probably wouldn't have been able to see the words from all the crying!<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read in a while, and certainly the best one I've read all year.<br />Go get it.<br />Now.<br />I'll wait.<br /><br />Good.<br /><br />Now, let's discuss...
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|This movie could get kids intasticed in reading the books. A lot of action and syspence. I hope all will enjoy.
147674355X|5.0|Sky meets Dean Holder, a boy with a reputation and a lot of baggage. But don't let that fool you. Because there's more to Holder than Sky ever thought. And he is the only person who can unlock Sky, making her feel, making her love, making her remember things she didn't know she had forgotten...<br /><br />I can't give away anything.<br /><br />Because then you won't be able to experience Hopeless the way it was meant to be experienced- shocked, amazed, really emotional.<br /><br />I will say that it is intense. It is heartbreaking. Heart shattering. Hopeful.<br /><br />It is love and warmth and evil and cruelty. It is beautifully written, well executed and brings the readers through such a mix of emotions, it's hard to stop thinking about this book. You think you know what it's about. You think you know what will happen. But so much happens, there are so many twists, so much you see coming and unexpected reactions and stories. The journey is overwhelming and I could not put it down.<br /><br />Sky is a wonderfully strong and complex character. Holder is everything the love interest should be. Patient, kind, complicated. Their affection, relationship is organic, not perfect, and not quick. They grow together, they experience sadness, joy, love and evil.<br /><br />Love. Love. Love.<br />Go read.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I got really tired of the radio stations and went back to listening to whole albums.

Great memories and now great new memories when the kids all know the words to our music.

B00000DHRX|5.0|I like this cd  because it has all my favorites on it. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes George Michael.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|im very happy with this product. they aren't the directors cut or anything but i don't even think those exist for these movies. it came in a nice box (the dvd cases themselves are very slim so the whole box is maybe 2 inches wide) with a plastic covering to keep it extra safe too! im very excited to have all the DVD's in one tidy place! and it was so cheap!
B00BSO2U1Y|1.0|the interesting aspect With this recording is that its refers to the original Sources of the score, much not heard before. All the standardcuts are open and there are several pages restored.<br />it gives another impression. The sound in the Orchestra is more like a barocksoundlike image.<br />the conducting is too light hearted for the drama. Neither of the soloists capture particularly much personality in the singing. Frankly Sumi Jo sounds as if she wants to go shopping in the first act trio instead of dealing with the conflict.<br />A lot can be said about the way bartoli sings norma. Bartoli sounds uneven and strange in the role of Norma. Her coloratura and legato line is not convincing. Compared to callas/caballe the casta diva is a negative surprise. The tempra o diva section has a improvisatorical elements in the vocal line but it doesnt underline the text. There is little drama going on within the character. Neither of the other singers show particularly much fire nor interest in the drama. Osborn as pollione is miscast, so are pertusi. They sound uninvolved and distant.<br />Another strange aspect is the lack of musical Depth in the drama.<br />The finale in the second act is embarassing. It does not raise the image of a tragedy. Its more like an uninvolved gathering.<br />What does this recording want to tell us? Perhaps nothing.<br />Compared to Callas in the divine Norma from la scala in december 1955, this recording is has a character of a comment to other normas. Or go to the cerquetti norma from rome in 1958.<br />[[ASIN:B003Y87G34 Vincenzo Bellini: Norma]]
0316247545|5.0|Having bought this on the side when I just bought the first two seasons I didnt really expect much from it. But I was really pleasantly surprised by what it offered. Concept art, interviews with animators, story writers, and Lauran Faust herself. It has descriptions and concepts for not only the main characters but multiple other characters in the show including some of its vilains, a map of the shows world of Equestria, overviews of all the episodes up to the end of the third season, all the letters to the princess that are written during the episodes, song lyrics for all the songs, and it even talks about the fandom for the show.<br /><br />The book itself is hardcover with it's design based around the actual book from the show which I found to be a very nice touch. It is all very nicely put together and presented in a way that fans of the show will definitely enjoy. I highly recommend this if you want to know more about the show and the people who made it.
0307352153|5.0|Nicely researched and for someone that is social but definitely a sensitive type, I felt like I was finally understood! Great read for anyone - introvert or extrovert!

B000FCKGPC|4.0|If you read other reviews before this one, odds are you might not be looking forward to OR have considered not reading this book at all. My advice? Read the book. It's really good. Not amazing like the last one, but very much worth your time. The story moves and you learn new things and see old things from a different perspective. Hell it's worth reading just to watch Cersei's madness unfold. And it's so good to watch that one lose it! Besides, being a fan or even just a reader of this series you should know by now-trust no one and don't get too fond of anyone. Who knows what twists this book could be setting up for, just down the Kings Road.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|I downloaded this app onto my kindle fire HD 2 months ago and I still  don't have a problem with it, this app helps you alot because it tells you how long your device will last until battery runs out. I haven't yet had eney battery drainage from this app. Some devices might not work with this app and it might cause the battery to die alot. But, if you have a kindle fire HD you shouldn't have a problem if this app doesn't go well try fixing your settings so you can download third party apps.This app also should be able to be downloaded on many other devices.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I have had 3 pairs of turtle beaches in the past 5 months each set would break after a month or so, i thought these would be better but they are just as crappy as others, I'm not rough on my headsets im pretty careful with them and treat them like a child, but after a month or so you move the cord wrong,  they break. these are utter crap, and i will never buy turtle beaches again.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|It had elements of Brothers Grimm (see the Sheriff - Peter Stormare - similar sort of nay sayer); the way some of the witches moved, reminded me of Army of Darkness or even some elements of Evil Dead.  Lots of action and nothing too serious.  It had some extra depth as if shot as a 3-D movie.  May have been when it was in the theatres.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It may not rise to the level of adding to the movie collection, but worth a watch.  I was hesitant.  Too bad the critics scared me away from this film.  This would have been fun in the theatre.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Works fine, fits well, and doesn't add much bulk to the phone.<br /><br />The screen protector is a little bit hard to get on, but that is mainly due to the fact that there an;t be ANY dust in the air. Even the tiniest particle will cause a &#34;bubble&#34; and you can't just smooth it away with the provided flattener. So, be sure to wipe the screen perfectly, turn off all the fans in the room, and hold your breath so as to keep the number of particles to a minimum. All the parts of the protector that properly flatten are pretty much indistinguishable from the screen itself, and it looks good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was sucked in right away.  Howey has to be the best Sci-Fi writer in a long time.  I only wished my grandfather were alive to have read this, he would have truly been a huge fan.
0307279189|5.0|Fantastic book to motivate the runner in all of us.  I bought this book for my husband a few years back and picked it up out of curiosity last week.  I was so intrigued and inspired that I couldn't put it down.  Not having run in years, I was inspired to put my running shoes on get back into the sport I once loved.  Great book!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie about the Holocaust.  It takes place in France and shows how the French deal with the Germans. It is sad but moving.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great puzzle app. just on level 8 but it's fun so far! I would recommend to friends. progressively harder - looking forward to next levels.
0007514239|5.0|Paulo Coelho has been my favorite author for a while now.... When I saw he had a new book coming out, I pre-ordered it. I already knew it would be a masterpiece! It is so beautifully written! His words speak to my soul!!
B002LANLDK|2.0|My internet connection was decent when I rented this, and the streaming was awful. Amazon says it chooses a video quality to match your internet speed, but in this case the lowest quality version still paused/buffered every couple of minutes. It was a painful experience.<br /><br />I recommend you don't rent from Amazon unless your internet connection is excellent. If that's the case, I'm sure the instant video service is great.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is actually pretty scary. I think the 99 cents is worth it. ive played this a thousand times and still jump out of my seat every time! I just wish that their was more levels and they would be longer. overall, if you enjoy the feeling of your heart pounding from pure fear, this game is just for you.
B00D41H2PS|1.0|Not even worth $1.29. They leave no clues as to what your supposed to do in the game.<br />Sorry I bought it. I will be real careful before I buy another game from them
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love all the matching games. and I hope any one. that plays this game they will love it.  it is a very fun game to play
B001D40U6Q|3.0|England, 1533. King Henry VIII is anxious to formally annul the marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and to wed Anne Boleyn in her stead. However, the Pope remains adamantly opposed to both the union and the king's reforming of the Church in England. As a major schism looms, the king finds himself at odds with some of his most loyal friends and supporters, including Sir Thomas More.<br /><br />The second season of The Tudors covers what is generally considered to be the most pivotal period in the life of King Henry VIII, extending from his marriage to Anne Boleyn to the latter's fall from grace and execution just three years later. This period includes the separation of the Church of England from Rome, the martyrdom of Thomas More, the birth of the future great Queen of England Elizabeth I, and the rise to prominence of Jane Seymour, who is destined to become Henry's third wife. It's a rich period of history, dramatised many times (but arguably most famously in the play and film A Man For All Seasons, which focuses on More). The Tudors, due to its wider scope, has the ability and freedom to take this story and integrate it into a wider dramatisation of Henry VIII's entire reign, which has positive and negative consequences. Negatively, this is arguably the heart of Henry VIII's story and what comes after cannot help but be anticlimactic in comparison (though the producers of the show certainly give it a go). On the plus side the great time afforded the story by a television series means that the show can do some very interesting things, like devoting the entire final episode of the season to the hours leading up to Anne's execution, a move which succeeds splendidly and gives us what may be the best episode of the series.<br /><br />A noticeable gap in the cast is that of Sam Neill, whose character of Cardinal Wolsey died at the end of the first season. The less-well-known James Frain has to step up as his effective replacement, the ruthless reformer Thomas Cromwell, and does an excellent job. The show also brings in the legendary Peter O'Toole as Pope Paul III, mainly to show the reactions to Henry's policies in Rome. This is a bit of an odd move, as this storyline never really goes anywhere. The Pope commands King Francis I of France to invade England, an ominous development which is subsequently ignored, and is later shown having frustrated episodes over the work of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. Amusing, but it forms a digression that might have been better spent in England fleshing out the existing, more prominent characters. O'Toole is, of course, brilliant, but his presence in this role does feel a little bit of a waste of a major casting coup.<br /><br />Natalie Dormer continues doing excellent work as Anne Boleyn, and has the difficult task of portraying the queen's descent into paranoia as she suffers miscarriages and earns the king's enmity. The show adopts a sympathetic approach to the queen, showing her to be distressed by her inability to bear the king a living son and innocent of the charges brought against her (though heavily indicating that she may have been promiscuous as a youth before meeting the king). Jeremy Northam also does good work as Sir Thomas More, the man of conscience and integrity who tries to balance his belief in his faith with his love for the king and dies for it.<br /><br />In the central role of Henry VIII, Jonathan Rhys Meyers shows early signs of improvement over his inert Season 1 performance. This may be attributable to his decision to 'do a Riker' and grow a beard between seasons. Unfortunately, the beard is rather unimpressive (a quarter-Riker at best) and his performance soon returns to a binary state of either being coldly inscrutable or insanely furious. Scenes which require him to smile or be jovial feel forced and unconvincing, and the less said about the spontaneous way he meets and immediately falls in love with Jane Seymour the better. The whole storyline withJane Seymour is rather badly handled, with the show deviating even further than it normally does from history (Jane had been at court for a year before Henry and Anne even married) and treating the relationship rather tritely, despite Anita Briem's best efforts with the material.<br /><br />On the plus side, Henry Cavill improves significantly this season as the king's best friend, Charles Brandon. He shows Brandon's growing maturity as he casts aside his philandering ways to concentrate on his family life, in contrast to Henry's constant flitting between mistresses, and also his growing spiritual crisis of faith at the things he has to do in the name of the Reformation. This is a theme that continues into the third season.<br /><br />Overall, the second season of The Tudors (***½) is much as the first: it's tosh but watchable tosh which gets a lot of the details of the history wrong but does succeed in nailing the broader picture. However, the second season is elevated over the first by the richer, more dramatic events being depicted and some improvements in both writing and acting.Jane Seymour is rather badly handled, with the show deviating even further than it normally does from history (Jane had been at court for a year before Henry and Anne even married) and treating the relationship rather tritely, despite Anita Briem's best efforts with the material.<br /><br />On the plus side, Henry Cavill improves significantly this season as the king's best friend, Charles Brandon.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|the app on level seven it froze on a picture frame like it wouldnt let me go back yeah i didnt like it there i just uninstalled it and are currently waiting for it to download so yeah hopefully it works this time(:
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I liked the factual presentation of the author's illness and was fascinated by his description of his afterlife journey.  I didn't consider the book to be religion based, but more of an insight into the spiritual nature of the universe.  I too believe all beings are connected in a spiritual realm that we cannot observe from this dimension.  I think it's definitely worth reading for believers and skeptics alike.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and so does my two year old. she loves taking pictures. and grooming the. horses.we love it
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read all three of her books and can not wait for another. Excellent reading. Hard to put down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is amazing and I recommend it for anyone who wants a good game so yeah :)
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|His other movie about the hitman in the Taxi was vastly superior than this. Since I didnt read any of the Jack Reacher novels I dont quite know what the deal is with this character. He tries to come off as a super hero but then he doesnt know simple things that Robert Duvall tells him. He sees minute details in one scene and then stumbles over obvious things that someone with his training and expertise should automatically know. About as entertaining as something you would watch on TV on a rainy day.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book is great it helps me to find words I don't understand I would  recommend it to all my friends with a kindle that It can also help them
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Lots of campy action. Better than the last one but not as good as original or number 3. Let's just forget about number 2. As Johnny Carson used to say, &#34;Day Cant all be gems!&#34;<br />Going to Chernobyl was stretching the imagination quite a bit. I wouldnt reccommend that part of Russia to anyone. Bruce Willis was a little Hammy worthy of Shatner but all in all it was entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have not been into any series like this in a very long time, I must say brovo and 2 thumbs up
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I just got this today, right on time.Its a very nice looking case. The white part of the case is hard shell and the part that flaps over is black. When i first took it out it felt kind of...cheap though. Im still deciding whether its worth the 15 dollars. It does though fit my kindle very nicely and i don't think it will fall out. Its also a very nice looking case, kind of like the covers everyone that has iPads uses, but for the kindle. The black flap on the inside has this fuzzy texture, which to me is a little weird and i don't like it very much but it may not bother other people. It also doesn't stand up very well when you fold over the front like in the picture, it doesn't stay up the kindle is to heavy for the flimsy flap to support it.<br />Still deciding whether or not to keep it.<br />Nice case looks good and fits well but seems a little bit cheap for $15<br /><br />Update: I returned it bc it was way too cheaply made for the price, but when i claimed a return and refund they gave me a refund but allowed me to keep the product, athough its cheap i got it for free now with the refund. Extra star for that! plus its better than nothing.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is so much like tf2.  It has classes, different game modes, and different guns.  What I don't like is you have to unlock the classes in this game
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Was very disappointed that I was sold a fake lifeproof case for my iPhone. After a piece fell off of the bottom and I contacted lifeproof they informed me I had purchased a fake case. DONT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!
B009X00E18|2.0|Not as useful and practical as the case I used for the original kindle.  The marware is clumsy and unstable in propped position.
B001B6EAOY|4.0|I use it for my PSP, and it is a great alternative for the quite expensive official memories, in conjunction with normal MicroSD cards which are way cheaper. The only nuisance is that it gets stuck inside my PSP 3k and I need a narrow object to dislodge it instead of only having to push and click it out like with normal official cards, although with the capability of getting a lot of space with two cards in it, I find that I almost never take it out of my PSP.
B009L6UDUG|4.0|I recently bought the Pierce Brosnan 007 collection on BluRay. Inexplicably, it only included three of the four movies. I looked at all the local retail outlets and did not find the missing one anywhere. I was pleased to find it online at a reasonable price, delivered on time and in very good condition.
B009178OQA|5.0|This documentary allows us to see a most remarkable man who strives for perfection.  We are taken behind the scenes of a sushi restaurant and the man who is the driving force that has created a legend in the culinary world.  Every aspect of the business is examined as we follow Jiro or his son as they seek out the finest ingredients for the sushi restaurant.<br /><br />This is more than a movie about food or sushi.  It tells and shows us a remarkable man and the events in his life that formed his drive and philosophy of life.  Highly recommended.
B005I4JG80|4.0|This was my first parenting book. I loved the style of Pamela's writing, a combination between personal and journalistic/research. It's a well thought out and thoughtful book. I hope that every parenting book will be as palatable as hers though I expect not.<br /><br />I thing I felt that could be a bit off putting is perhaps some of her writing can be interpreted as Anti-American. I think a person who chooses to read this book should already somewhat desire/be in the same wave length as the message of book (ie more French, less American). A patriot would be offended.<br /><br />There are also some things that I choose not to agree with, in particular the breast feeding topic. I don't plan to take all if her advice. I will use what I like and is realistic for me and implement it to my own personal parenting ideals. I think some reviewers who hate the book are a bit too unforgiving due to the fact that they don't agree with one or some of her advice but I think a lot of her advice is good food for thought for any parent
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Grandma couldnt wait to see the third season, so the boys got it for her.  She set aside '&#34;do not disturb time&#34; and watched it all in one week.  That says it all!
B0083V2WBS|5.0|Hugh Laurie did an excellent job on this combo. Putting together these tunes along with history of New Orleans was outstanding. Anyone who appreciates music, especially Jazz, will appreciate this disc.
B000I3UAJ0|2.0|It seemed slow paced and just wasn't very compelling. One would need to be a true &#34;Trekky&#34; to enjoy it.
B00A7MSHHO|5.0|this is 'the' definitive 1/12 scale batman. fully articulated and surperbly detailed, i strongly recommend this figure. the high price tag is fully merited and worth every penny. do not miss out on this figure. comes with extra pairs of hands and accesories and clear stand. get this!
B000I3SYEI|4.0|This was more interesting than Star Trek 1. The story moved along at a good pace. Even a non-Trekky would enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Quick little 8-floor escape game (they promise more to come).  Easy enough to not frustrate, hard enough to make you think.  I love these escape games, and this is a gem.  Played perfectly on my 2nd gen. Kindle Fire.  Thanks, MobiGrow!
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Hugh Jackman is not Alfie Bow.  Russel Crowe's singing really detracts from the movie. Basically he is not up to the part.  Anne Hathaway and Marius had the best voices.  It is a shame that the producer chose well known actors instead of getting individuals who could really sing the music.  The music is the center of this show.
B000TEUSJU|1.0|Filmed in a dark mode, hard to see, over dramatic, a poor porn film, a lousy history depiction. Looks like it was written by self imortalized European drama queens. The only person I would reccommend this to would be gentlemen who pick up my trash on Thursday.<br /><br />A waste of my time and money.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The premium version of this app is completely worth it. You can create your own mix of souns, down to how loud you want each sound to play. The timer mode is great, and the app plays in the background while I check email, Facebook, etc. I use this to get to sleep every night.
1591845556|5.0|First, the book arrived a day early and I sat down to browse it. I soon found myself engrossed in the material and actually giddy about learning. What I love most about this book is that while the method is straightforward, it is not simple. To do this, to learn something significant in 20 hours means HARD work. Josh showed us he was willing to do that and that with effort, we can learn anything we want to ... in about 20 hours.<br /><br />My only gripe is that now I have several new things I want to learn after reading about Josh's experiences! And I HIGHLY recommend you find the video of him playing his uke at the TED Talk. Google it. Or check out his site. Read the chapter on learning to play the uke, then watch it. THAT is an example of learning something in 20 hours. Fantastic!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movies soars! All though I personally don't like seeing Denzel portray flawed characters; he does it so damn well! Kudos to Mr. Washington for another outstanding performance. Versatility be thy name. This movie draws the audience into the gut of the lead character. You actually feel his pain! Great adult entertainment. I highly recommend that you see this movie.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|This was a great movie, love to watch it however the Amazon digital purchase kind of is a rip off since you can not download a version to your computer....why spend that kind of money on a movie when you can buy the dvd for the same price.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Even though I, like everyone else, knew the ending of this movie, it was still thrilling! Very well done. I was riveted by the story, the acting, the action, and the anticipation of what was to come at the end of this movie! This is a must see movie.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. It's answered a lot of c ok concerns I've had about myself and level of social interaction. To realize that I wasn't just antisocial but merely introverted has brought a lot of peace to my mind.<br /><br />Additionally, this book has provided a lot of extremely helpful tips on how to conduct myself in situations that routinely make me uncomfortable.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to those who question whether they are antisocial or just introverted. This book has completely changed my outlook on my social and professional interactions
B009AMAM9S|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about, so within five minutes of starting it, I paused it and went to the internet to read about it.<br /><br />You do not have to be a Buddaist, smart, or ignorant to understand its meaning.  It was three stories that told the same message.  Whatever that message is for you, that is what it is.  I saw what it meant to me, including conflicted, heartfelt, wonderful, inspiring and a little in awe.  I loved it and I don't usually follow these movies very well...but I decided to read about it first, then I understood everything.  READ first before watching, even a brief synopsis is a start to understanding.  Brilliant
B00021HBGS|5.0|This was a great purchase. I even bought 2, 1 for each bathroom. My boy and girl each find favorites within. This was a great buy. They stay on the tub well. The children love driving the trucks on the road. Would tell my &#34;mommy friends&#34; to purchase!

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I thought the game was really good. You can really get creative and do your own solution to the level our just go wild on free play.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I actually saw this in theaters 3 times and bought the blu-ray the day it came out! I would recommend it to anyone!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am a zombie enthusiast. I've read all the Walking Dead comic issues up to date, I've seen almost all zombie movies ever created and I can't wait for this movie to come out in a couple days. This book takes a different approach to a zombie stor, talking to the survivors in the aftermath of a huge worldwide zombie apocalypse. Great read!
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|Americans are holding German guns and there is a quad bazooka.Other than that it is fun and easy.It's a good game.
B000RHKARY|5.0|The original version of this album on vinyl has been in my collection for many years, and has been a favorite of mine.  It contained twelve tracks, but this CD contains those plus the addition of another ten interesting bonus tracks, so it was worth getting.  I consider this collection one of John Mayall's four or five best recordings, considering the overall sound and song selections.  I got a kick out of Mayall's theme here of &#34;crusading for the blues&#34;; he is a fan and promoter of the music as well as one presenting his version of the music.  Many of the songs you will recognize and are associated with other artists, but do not expect that these will sound like those original versions.  Mayall brought his voice, arrangements, and the band's instrumentation to the sessions, and you will hear some different blues as a result.  Mick Taylor on lead guitar helps the sound to a great extent with his sustained guitar tone and swinging, tasteful runs.  The additions of Chris Mercer on tenor saxophone and Rip Kant on baritone sax also add to the mix.  The horns certainly give the overall sound some sophistication with a touch of R&B.  Also, I give credit to the Bluesbreakers for being able to play slow enough when required to carry the feeling.  All in all, this is a satisfying, fresh take on the blues that still has that sound many years removed from when it was originally released.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Best entertainment for my kids while on the road, at home, or in stores. Anything to get peace and quiet.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|This album is very inspiring, inspirational, charismatic, funny, and very entertaining. The beats are futuristic and production is outstanding. Kanye West hats off to you for delivering a cold cut classic multi-platinum Grammy award winning album.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|While this film may not please everyone it is good to have our favorite action hero back on the big screen. let hope he will do a new conan film as conan in his later years as a king by his own hand.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I love it, my 3 yr old loves It. It is one of my favorite movies and I don't mind that my daughter wants to watch it multiple times in a row. My fav Miyazaki film.
B008J34466|2.0|Just my opinion...Bought this without hearing more than 3 songs - thought they were so good I would like it. But after listening to the whole CD I've decided it's too angry and negative for me and I only listen to &#34;Try&#34; and &#34;Just Give Me a Reason&#34;. Absolutely love the way Pink and Nate sound together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was not difficult but had just the right amount of challenge to make you think. I would have liked it to have more levels but saw there should be more coming.

B00BZW5W3W|5.0|[[ASIN:B00D23K0MU Blue Velvet Soul]]<br />This is some of Maysa's best work yet. I have loved Maysa since she released her debut album in 1995 that I had discovered a few years ago.  I am glad that real R&B music is making a return to us instead of some of the garbage that we are stuck with listening to on the radio.  If only there were more radio stations that would play music like this.  I would highly recommend this album to add to your Maysa collection or to start your Maysa collection!<br />Favorite Tracks:<br />Good Morning Sunrise<br />When You Touch Me<br />Sophisticated Lover<br />Inside My Dream<br />Quiet Fire<br />I liked all the tracks on here, but these were the ones that stood out to me the most.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|A few years ago, I went to see one of my favorite artists in concert, Janelle Monae. I quickly realized though, that almost the entire crowd was there not for her or Wale--but the opening act, J. Cole. Within minutes, Cole had the entire audience on their feet and rapping along with him. I didn't know his music at all, but found myself moving along with the crowd and smiling just because the vibe was so good. I had to wait two years though before I could go and buy his first album though. I wasn't that impressed to be honest. I thought that I had somehow mis-remembered how good Cole was.<br /><br />Two years later though, J. Cole is back with the album I think he had always been trying to make. He even says as much on the brilliant \\"Let Nas Down.\\" It's clear the label and Jay-Z made him release a far different debut album than he had intended originally. This though--this is where you really see him.<br /><br />\\"Born Sinner\\" is both reverential as well as super modern musically. Cole hasn't hopped on the bandwagon of rap trends like having a girl sing all of his choruses or making the beats all dance tracks, but he is also not stuck in the past. His beats are clean yet with subtle touches that really elevate them like a jazz saxophone. He both samples as well as references tracks from the beginning of rap in a very respectful way-- A Tribe Called Quest, Biggie, and Outkast all make appearances. Also, Cole very smartly pairs himself with some great collaborators like the Dirty Projectors' Amber Coffman, Miguel and a choir who all provide a contrast to his rather deadpan delivery.<br /><br />Lyrically Cole is a beast. He is introspective and thoughtful, sometimes bragging, sometimes telling stories. He's not afraid to really be vulnerable and honest in his questioning of some of his choices and his daily struggles. \\"Runaway\\" was especially poignant as he discusses racial issues and ties that back in with his own family history.<br /><br />Now we do have to mention the elephant in the room though: Kanye West. It's not being unfair to compare the two--Cole is in fact begging for it. He knew exactly what he was doing when he released this album the same day as West dropped his. He forced himself into the conversation. And personally, I think his gamble worked. While ironically, Cole actually sounds like early West on a couple tracks, these two albums could  not be more different. Where Kanye's is aggressive and arrogant to the extreme (the \\"I am a god\\" track hello), Cole is human and self-deprecating (see title track \\"Born Sinner\\"). Kanye is off \\"making art\\" with minimal electronic beats, but Cole focused on making one of the best hip hop albums of the year. So yes, West might be more revolutionary and his hype machine is massive right now, but at the end of the day I'm going to be listening to Cole's album.<br /><br />Things that bother me: despite the fact that pretty much every rapper ever (including women) do this, the objectification of women on some songs does get annoying. The empowering message on \\"Crooked Smile\\" (featuring TLC) would mean a lot more if he could actually refer to women as neither a B***h nor a H*e.<br /><br />Hands down one of the best albums's of the year. I would recommend to every lover of rap out there. This album is personal and really pushes the boundaries of what old school rap artists might sound like if they were making music in 2013. It's not a throwback, but an evolution of rap music. It's modern rap in the very best way possible.<br /><br />***Update, Nas just dropped a remix to the already brilliant \\"Let Nas Down.\\" Seriously, go look it up. It's so incredible to hear rappers who are more concerned about hip hop than silly made up beefs.elephant in the room though: Kanye West.

The empowering message on \\"Crooked Smile\\" (featuring TLC) would mean a lot more if he could actually refer to women as neither a B***h nor a H*e.<br /><br />Hands down one of the best albums's of the year. I would recommend to every lover of rap out there. This album is personal and really pushes the boundaries of what old school rap artists might sound like if they were making music in 2013. It's not a throwback, but an evolution of rap music. It's modern rap in the very best way possible.<br /><br />***Update, Nas just dropped a remix to the already brilliant \\"Let Nas Down.\\" Seriously, go look it up. It's so incredible to hear rappers who are more concerned about hip hop than silly made up beefs.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|A very good read.  I have read numerous books by Philippa Gregory and have never been disappointed.  Each book has an ending; you do not have to &#34;stay tuned&#34; for the next book, although I try not to miss one of her books.
1597801585|1.0|I chose this book based on the fact that it won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards but after reading it I am mystified as to why.  What did they see in it that I missed?<br /><br />It took me several weeks but I heroically made it halfway through the book before giving up, contrary to my 3 chapter rule that if a book doesn't grab me by then it is not going to either improve over time or redeem itself with a great ending.  My complaints are:<br /><br />1. The characters are utterly boring---even the &#34;wind-up girl&#34; herself---and so unsympathetic that I didn't care what happened to any of them so their stories didn't pull me along.  I wasn't even sure who the villains were---oh wait, that makes them &#34;complex&#34;, right?<br /><br />2. The plot (actually sub-plots) were rambling and unclear, inexplicably jumping from from one to another so I wondered what exactly this book was about.  Halfway through I still didn't know.<br /><br />3. The author has the annoying habit of continually referring to past events crucial to the plot that we know nothing about.  It is like an inside joke you are not in on so you can't comprehend the references ---It made me feel like I was reading a trilogy out of sequence.<br /><br />4. As noted by other reviewers, the author's style is stilted, needlessly peppered with obscure foreign words, and he commits the literary crime of using 15 words where 4 will do.  At times, I felt I was reading the characters' Tweets----not only bad style but as most Tweets are, excruciatingly boring.<br /><br />If you are still interested in reading this over-hyped tripe, I suggest you get it at the library rather than invest money in it.  My copy went in the recycle bin rather than Goodwill since I didn't want to be responsible for inflicting it upon other unwary readers.
B00006EXDM|5.0|It's amazing how all the remasters sound and if you pair this up with a set of Bose headphones...WOW!!! You'll hear sounds in the background that you never heard before. This is an excellent double CD.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This is a well done product for my kindle and I would like to inform all that as well. Thanks
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I've had this product for 3 weeks and it works perfectly. I love that it has two outputs so you can charge two phones at a time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app, although short, is very fun and it promises more levels to come in new updates. I suggest you get this app. Plus, it is free, so why not give it a shot?
B00DF0POXA|3.0|Yeah was only $10 but its only 10 tracks deep. The songs sound more like commercial jingles or something. Interesting album for sure. I want my $ back Yeezy! Lol
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like the intuitive movement of the cards. This is my favorite version. I like it much better than several versions that are offered on the Microsoft store for Windows 8. Good job.
B003VANOFY|5.0|i've owned a few logitech headsets in the past. i always went with cheaper $30-$40 price ranged wired headsets. they were generally a bit smaller too. it led to discomfort after a few hours, and wires all over the place, i caught these on sale for $80 bucks, yet i can still wholeheartedly recommend them at the current sticker of $109.<br />Pros:<br />- the headset itself is wireless; after years of wired headsets i enjoy the freedom immensely. i despise cable management.<br />- large comfortable earcups, easy to adjust, padded &#34;over-the-head&#34; bridge makes for comfortable long sessions.<br />- great sound!<br />- 8-10 hour battery life is legit.<br />- included logitech software is great, it really adds to that premium-product feel.<br />Cons:<br />- 7.1 emulated sound leaves something to be desired, specifically in some games the effect ends up cutting out dialogue (far cry 3 was a major offender). i just keep this mode switched off. it still sounds superb<br />- charging base is a little weird - maybe it's just because i'm a pervert but i hate how it looks on my desk, i can never find a good mutual cord length (the extra cordage does spool back up into the base rather nicely). all that cable management off your head ends up on your desk... and i can see the dongle being easy to lose; all in all a bit cumbersome, but not worth taking points off the score.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great game. Keep them coming. Great graphics. Thanks again. This is one of the best games. Have played many g5 games.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|It's fun to play agenst your friends. Each level is chalenging.  I recomand anyone to play. I dare you. ok
0131103628|5.0|Great content and made for a super easy transition. Thank you kindly for all you're hardwork! I used this to learn native C for Android.
B00CW665VI|5.0|couldn't put the book down. very funny quick read. loved characters and point of view. can't wait to read more from this author.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addicting! And way better than the first don't hesitate! You should get this AWESOME game :):):)
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was one of the best I have ever read! It started off slow in the beginning but once she went to the garden, I couldn't stop reading.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I really enjoyed this animated film as it was both visually stimulating and had a wonderful plot. The bonds between family are wonderfully portrayed by the owlets.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J. Coles production has definitely improved within the last couple of years, and I disagree with the other review. He doesn't need to depend on others forbeats in order for him to make it in into the elites. In my opinion, he is already in the elites, one of the best and this album proves. Twice as good as is last album. Lyrics are well thought out. All in all, the album just flows. He doesn't need rap features because he pretty much said everything he needed to say in this album. This album does not disappoint.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|A great book offering great food for thought regarding the acceptance of both extroverts and introverts, and all they can uniquely offer.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|Not exactly a classic in my opinion. Doesn't even come close. The lyrics are deep, but the album doesn't flow well at all. Kanye had all this time to come up with an album that definitely didn't come close to all the hype. The album has 2 good songs. Black skinheads and new slaves. I would just cop those 2 and save your money. Also only comes with 10 songs, the album seems incomplete with just 10 songs, no deluxe version either.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|This is a great app. It gives you guidance for a work out without having to purchase a $10 DVD I really love this app!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is my go to place for solutions to just about anything. I like to do things myself and enjoy finding new and different ways to complete any task. Pinterest is better than buying a book of tips. I can find everything I need in one place.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|Love the story and Helen Hunt did an excellent job.  And J. Hawkes was great. Sad, but sweet.  feel good movie
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like the fact that this game isn't all about speed. It's a little more technical than it is fast which I like  lot. A great free game!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Though the wait time can take a while before you can do certain things, it's a really fun game, and a fun way to waste time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game has tons of my favorite games in just one package! I love it I rate it 5 stars
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Watching the Longmire series on A&E got me interested in the books the show was based on.  The Cold Dish is a good quick read, I look forward to reading the next book in the series.  If you like the show, you will like the book.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is amazing!!!!!! I think though that Jace hasn't Clarys brother I'm sure there not related. Lol please read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We love this movie, great for family viewing. So funny the adults loved it too. This was the first movie my 3 year old sat and watched the whole way through.
B00594XOZU|5.0|this is awesome fir texting it friend!!!love it so if it friend  have phone u do not..do not worry get this app
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is a very good game and also it is a very fun game for those who like war games
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|I think there was a central message in there somewhere, but there were too many questions and I felt myself working very hard during the movie to keep up.  Too much of a mental workout.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|I bought this as a survival/emergency knife. Little did I know how thick the blade is. That's great for when you need to split wood and all, but just realize it makes for a heavy knife. If you are, like me, looking for an emergency type tool, it might be better to stick with the classic Ka-Bar Marine knife. If, on the other hand, you expect to get a lot of use out of it on a regular basis, definitely give this one a shot. It's about as solid as they come.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I've been a fan of Kanye's music since his first album but overall this album is largely forgettable, especially coming off Good Music and Watch the Throne.  There's a few decent tracks, but nothing I feel like listening to over and over again.  New Slaves is probably the strongest track on the album, but even it's not among Kanyes best.<br /><br />Musically it reminds me a lot of 808s and Heartbreaks, which was probably my least favorite Kanye album.  Oh well, I guess they can't all be winners.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I enjoy a good movie from time to time. I think Denzel Washington is such a seasoned actor and just gifted. The movie does have a lesson in it and what I saw was an impaired person who was in denial and not able to see that their behavior jeopardized the life of others. The lesson of the story still remains the same...don&#34;t drink and drive anything while under the influence.
1433527189|5.0|I love this bible! The ESV bible is one of the most comprehensible bibles out there and it doesn't sound as dumbed down as the NIV lol I have nothing against the NIV btw. I bought this because it was recommended by John Piper and Mark Driscoll :) love those two. Thank God for them.
B004UID2LC|1.0|the new update killed the app now there are ads and other viruses this app use to be good i would always use it for downloading music and still do but the videos are busted save your space!!!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Second best Lady A album! Beautiful songs and best vocals. \\"All For Love\\" is definitely the best track on here. Highly recommended! This band never disappoints.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Love this unit from Satechi, everything works as described.  It makes my Prius Basic come alive with music. I've used other types before but this unit has FB frequency options - it's an extremely valuable capability if you travel from one city to another.  Make a stored memory change from one frequency to another using remote! No static ever!<br /><br />Satechi's product is first class.  They are knowledgeable and offer quick response to questions in a positive way.  They are a company that is here to stay.  You know the old saying \\"You can't go broke, making the customer happy\\"...
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Even though the Farros left after 'Brand New Eyes', Paramore still are a great band, and this album is proof. This album is new territory but also still has the same Paramore roots. In my opinion, every song is great, and this album really shows Paramore's growth. \\"Fast In My Car\\" is a great beginning for the record, still sounding like \\"Paramore\\" but being quite different at the same time. \\"Now\\" is a heavier track that is amazing, and was a great first taste of this record. \\"Grow Up\\" is much different from the usual, but has great lyrics and is very catchy. \\"Daydreaming\\" sounds like Paramore to me, and is very well-written and beautiful. The 3 interludes are quite catchy and different. \\"Ain't It Fun\\" is really funky with an amazing gospel choir at the end. \\"Part II\\" is much like Paramore, being the sequel to the RIOT! hit, \\"Let the Flames Begin.\\" Personally my favorite track on the record. \\"Last Hope\\" is a beautiful, deep song that sounds much like the band we knew. \\"Still Into You\\" is a catchy, cute, bubbly pop love song. \\"Anklebiters\\" is a very meaningful, special song that is so well-written! It's as punk as punk can get. \\"Proof\\" is one of the best songs off here, in my opinion. The music is what makes it stand out from the other songs. \\"Hate to See Your Heart Break\\" is an amazing, slow song with violins, and it's no doubt one of Paramore's best slow songs. \\"One Of Those Crazy Girls\\" has a classy style but in a new form. It was a great idea by Paramore! \\"Be Alone\\" sounds much like Paramore, and has amazing verses! \\"Future\\" is a long, heavier song that is one of the best songs off here!<br />So in all, this is Paramore's second best album in my opinion. If there's any other album that sounds like this one, it would definitely be RIOT! One of the best albums ever! Highly recommended.
0767827791|5.0|I have not seen this movie since I screened it in the 1950s, It was still as dramatic as I remembered,<br />I had forgotten how good looking Kim Novak was,  The movie still has a message for everyone even today.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I saw tymhis movie in theater with my cousin and my sister. We really enjoyed this film! I'm not a big fantasy person but for someone who's not a big fan of fantasy I really enjoyed this movie! Good sound quality good movie! Add thistle to your shopping cart now!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I am a fan of all the Temple Run games but this is by far my favorite!  I am loving it.  :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great! My dad wouldn't give me back my kindle fire. I recommend this game for all ages.TRUST ME!!!!!
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|I am already a huge fan of Naomi Watts and this movie reminded me again why she is the best out there.  The screen shared with her and Tom Holland was some of the best and most real acting I have ever seen.  I understand why people are annoyed that they changed the Spanish family to a white family, but it isn't about the race of the person it's about the story of loss and survival.  I understand locals died as well in great numbers, but just imagine being ripped apart from your family while on vacation in a foreign country with probably little or no understanding of the language.  The people most affected were those at the beach front resorts that received a direct hit from this wave.  I think we should be mad at the government officials that failed to warn people of the impending disaster even after it struck areas and hours passed before it struck another area.  This movie is so compelling and beautiful that you get a glimpse into the extreme loss and beautiful shows of humanity from both locals and tourists.  A must see!!
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Great movie at a low Amazon price!  I love it.  This is the best of the Batman series.  I just needed more words.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it wont let me update the app how can i get the newly updated versions of this game and it will keep updateing as it goes
B00B7Y0206|1.0|this is very annoying. I cant even download the thing. it says unable to install. its completley ridiculous! it may be a good app for those of you who have tried it, but I cant even use it so I'm giving it a 1 star review.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very helpful. We've used it on the road as well as in the city and it has proved to be be accurate.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My 3 yr old loves this pool! By far the best money we've ever spent on a pool! Would definitely buy again!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm a 13 year old girl and I still love my little ponys yeah, I said it.. it's a great game and I recommend it to anyone who loves ponies ^^ even if their 13 like me (: 5 stars all the way &lt;3
B005K17RU0|1.0|go back to your old format it was great compared to this improvement. it was much easier to view the days hour by hour
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I downloaded this app and the first time i opened it it said vtube has stopped  so i quit it and opened it again and it said vtube has stopped so i turned off the kindle and turned it back on but it still did it and i didnt even watch 1 vodeo on it i would not recommend this app
B000AYEL1A|5.0|It worked on my DVD player. Finally, someone must have tested it to make sure it worked on a DVD player.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is perfect for people 5 and up. Anyone who understands how to use a phone or device can play the simple game. Everyone I know has Subway Surfers and we enjoy competing through Facebook on the app. Unlike most free apps, advertisements are uncommon and they very rarely ask you to rate the app or pay to upgrade.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is the best game it is so fun and challenging  mind twisting that is what I think of this game
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Love the story. I'm a huge Austen and Bronte fan. When I read their stories I can't help but wish I were back in that era.
0062059963|4.0|I have been reading in the love story and romance books genre a lot lately. Dabbing in to all sorts of different types. This has been very different and yet interesting. No spoilers here, but I will be the first to say I don't like the bachelor like you see on TV. So I didn't think I would like this. But I began reading it and I liked it because of its depth. The author does not make her over-whining or over hard. She is very in between. Her situation is unique but very fun to follow. The main male leads, Aspen and Maxon are both very well made as well. The pro's for the book would be that it is very original and keeps you on your toes. Doesn't drag out, but doesn't miss those details that keep the story alive.<br /><br />The cons however would be that toward the second book I begin to feel a little annoyed with America. *Spoiler* there is a love triangle between American, Maxon and Aspen. I feel that one page she is telling us that she is falling for Maxon and then the next she is with Aspen and then it is like Maxon was just that boy she had a crush on. Toward the end of the book I do feel like she settles with her feelings. But at first it was like okay, she is confused but after she went back and forth about I don't know about-half a book I wanted to punch her l.i.k.e pick one. We are left a little hanging but with more of a clue of who she might end up with. However I do not want to lock that in. This girl may switch again-who knows?  Other than the exhausting love triangle, I would say the only other negative would have to be that I do feel like even as the main character she is a little to safe. When people around her do something and then they get harshly punished.However just because she is a favorite among the prince she gets special treatment. I think that something to humble her and bring her back to down to earth would of made her more vunerable rather than we get the persona that she could set the damn palace on fire and Maxon would still excuse it.<br/><br />Hopes for the third book would be for not to see so much political stuff (that it stays like it is under wraps) and we see more of the love between America and Maxon. That her choice isn't drawn out. America's emotions pick an emotion and stick with it. She will stop flipping flopping every time she is with Maxon or Aspen.<br /><br />For others would are in the polls of who she will end up with. I am hoping Maxon.<br /><br />I recommend this series and hopefully will be able to say the same thing about the last book. Look forward to reading it!
B00D78J7SI|4.0|4.5 STARS Finally! After the pseudo-disappointments of Bloodrunk and Relentless... (I dont consider AYDY a disappointment..but I did like it less than all before it) , The boys have finally come up with a worthy sucessor to Hate Crew Death Roll. After hearing their entire catalog front to back, this is definitely pretty damn good....not Follow The Reaper Good...but enough for me to recall why I fell in love with these cats over 12 years ago.<br /><br />Lots of intensity and catchy melodies to be found here! Solos are typical Bodom (which is a good thing), Alexi's vocals are pretty good, and the rhythm section is definitely solid.<br /><br />I can say that I enjoyed every song. I cannot say that about Bloodrunk or Relentless..., although they also had some good tracks and/or moments. Even when Bodom is bad, theyre good! And when theyre good, theyre bloody brilliant!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is good for anyone who likes a fast paced book that keeps you turning the pages and not knowing what you'll find around the corner.  Hats off David Baldacci!
1400032717|5.0|I have never read a more realistic treatment of an autistic person. He does a real bangup job and finds the answer,
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So disappointing!!  I was a huge fan after the first two in this series, couldn't wait to read the end of Gideon and Eva's story only to read \\"Entwined With You\\" and discover it doesn't end.  Not only doesn't it end, EWY makes you end up not liking either one of the main characters and not even enjoying the secondary characters all that much.  If you'd have taken out all the sex and all the times they said they loved one another in a multitude of ways, you'd have ended up with an 80 page book that wasn't remotely interesting.  Nothing about this book made me want to care or read any more about these two.  In fact, half way through I stopped reading to re-read a Kristen Ashely book that I love, just so I could read about people I actually enjoy and care about.  Gideon becomes needy and pathetic and Eva becomes bitchy and flaky. . .not very loveable qualities in people. And none of the cliffhangers that she leaves you with are even about the main characters, it's all stuff hanging about the actions and motivations of secondary and tertiary characters. . .you don't care when all is said and done!!  The book in no way ends leaving you wanting more, it ends as if she just left 10 to 12 chapters off the end of the book.  Turning a trilogy into a 4 or 5 book series after you've gotten your fans sucked into a couple of books is just wrong and seems like a huge money grab, especially when charging THAT much for an ebook.  Seriously people, save your money, she robbed her fans in this one, don't reward her by buying it.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Well...as others said...this was a trilogy...which has been turned into a Foreverilogy.  Ridiculous the endings in these books.  I actually liked these books better than some others...for a minute.  I am angry and disappointed with the outcome, and the lame twists that are just creating too much drama.  For heaven's sake, give the kids a break and give us the happily ever after.  I, unfortunately, pre-ordered this book and now I can't return it...I have to sell it back.  I might...because I don't see myself buying any more at $9.99...Sigh.<br /><br />I was mad when the Harry Potter series ended without enough information...but at least she wrapped it up.  I know some day you'll get around to it, Ms. Day, but I'm not hanging around for it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It took a lot longer to finish this book than the other two where I could not put that first book down. I would of liked a different ending but glad Katniss and Peeta ended together.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|It is a deception for those who need the subtitles in Spanish, offers this collection with subtitles in Spanish and English subtitles only brings. Amazon.com Until I fix this, I'll give as much 1 star.<br />Update 1: The versión that came to me was from the the seller \\"BargainDevices\\".<br />Update pending .... Amazon attends for my complaint.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The events in Thailand were terrible and unforgettable for many. This movie makes a great effort at sharing the story with the viewer, taking us through those moments and through the terrible pain the survivors had to endure. The actors are great (Naomi Watts and the kids are the best, McGregor comes across a bit lame) and the reconstruction of events is great. It's not an easy movie to watch, but totally worth it if you really want to understand what happened those days.
B007SGM084|5.0|Not at all what I had though these books were about but actually I'm glad since really there are plenty of vampire novels out for reading and I've definitely read my fair share. I have to say the first 10 or so chapters had me speechless but I decided to read more,yes I almost didn't finish these books but I'm glad I did finish because I would have missed an amazing story, thank you E L James, this was a wonderful read, interesting and I'm not even sure if that word fits. I really liked this story line and was relieved to find that in fact there is a story line, it's not book porn like some folks has made it solely to be about, there is a great deal of very describing details but isn't that what we want when we set down to read a book. Her writing leaves nothing to guess about and that's what I'd like with any author. Again love these books and enjoyed the story, thanks again for sharing your imagination.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I respect the franchise, Bruce Willis created some cool movies that entertained an entire generation. I just don't get this last one. There are too many contradictions, events turn unexpected without apparent logic, and the characters insist on stopping in between action, taking their time to explore personal relationships and characterizations that only remain on the surface, yet this stops the action. So is it an action movie, or a character development movie? I'm at a loss...
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the one to buy extras to give as gifts!  Real life drama, Humor,Love, and Christian values will never go out of style. Surprizingly FUNNY, as well as Deep and INSPIRING for EVERY FAMILY MEMBER. A very  well thought out movie. Haven't met anyone yet who didnt enjoy and take away encouragement from this!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I am a big fan of this TV series. I love all the characters. Will probably buy the other seasons later on
B00005RDRO|4.0|Best who-done-it and many famous stars - the ending is a surprise, as usual with Neil Simon's work. Enjoyed the entire movie.
B008SOS63S|5.0|This live CD gives you not only Bonamassa original songs but also includes several special guests including Beth Hart.  Definitely worth owning!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Not what I had expected, but turned out to be very funny; I am a Dame Maggie Smith fan anyway so really enjoyed the movie
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Bonamassa and band deliver a stunning acoustic concert at the Vienna Opera House where he manages to blow us away without cranking up a single amp!  Bonamassa reimagines and breathes new life into his original songs during this acoustic venue and delivers worthy performances in his covers of classic blues tunes.  His band mates bring their &#34;A games&#34; as well, especially Lenny Castro on percussion.  Case and point:  Dislocated Boy.  Doesn't get any better than this!!!
1439192812|5.0|Another great book by a great author. Not only does this book upgrade one's knowledge to some of the latest discoveries within the scientific community, but also dispels the past and current mythological representations with truth based on empirical evidences. Humanity seems to be &#34;collectively&#34;  at the age of a young child whose imagination still envisions &#34;monsters under the bed&#34; and &#34;in the closet.&#34; Richard Dawkins has done a great job of bringing such nonsense and darkness into light for anyone who will enjoy this and all of his literary and scientific genius.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|After hearing only the clips of the MP3s, I knew I would love this CD.  Now I can't get enough.  It's official - I'm addicted.  I was already a Bonamassa fan but now I'm a Beth Hart fan too.  What a voice!!  Imagine Janis Joplin, Tina Turner and Ella Fitzgerald all rolled up into one.  Hart manages to negotiate some difficult soul material and make it her own.  Powerhouse voice!!  And of course, Bonamassa is at his best.  What a fantastic compilation of great soul tunes; Bonamassa and Hart pay homage to those that came before them but also put their own unique stamp on these songs.  You have got to own this music!!!
1400069742|5.0|Very interesting and quite shocking.  Who knew that Roosevelt was such a weenie, sort of a McClellan of politics?  Or that Wendell Wilkie was such a good guy and would probably have been a better President than FDR?  I enjoyed it from first page to the last.

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I saw the movie on a plane, and it was a pretty good movie I thought. Even better for free.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert (though it is no real spoiler) that Oz the Great and Powerful was not a wizard as professed,<br />but through years of trickery as a circus magician, Oz manages to change the land of Oz for the better<br />even though he is wildly outclassed by very real magic.<br /><br />There's also some backstory on the 3 witches (East, West, Glenda the Good).<br />I'm not the kind to watch this kind of movie normally, but like I said it was on the plane & I had insomnia.<br /><br />Very pleasant movie, good for the kids, James Franco is good, Mila Kunis does great (always looks hot too),<br />also has the girl from The Mummy in it. All actors do an excellent job and work together well.<br /><br />My short review: \\"Oz\\" gives you the warm-fuzzies a few times and the kids will love it. A good clean family movie.

B00AK57N00|3.0|I've tried to pick this up several times now but I get bored pretty quickly. Your guy swings from post to post and you simply tap to tell him to let go. You are aiming for the center of the next post. (Where if you land there you get the ackward acclaimation of \\"just!\\" which doesn't make a lot of sense in English.) It can get hard. But watching someone swing and pushing a single button makes this game far more simple than even the simplest Atari game from 30 years ago. It's Just! not my thing.

1591845556|5.0|This book is filled with great tips on how to tackle the sometimes difficult task of starting to learn a skill. After reading this books, many could find out that it's not that hard to start learning something.<br />This book is NOT about BEING THE BEST in a short time, it's about starting the process of learning in a pragmatic and useful way. The first 3 chapters contain the essence of the book; the other ones explain how the author used his methodology on learning different skill.<br />Even though the book emphasises on the first weeks of the learning process, the methodology can be applied on the whole learning experience (even top achievers may use this to level up their skills).<br />If i had to choose between the best tips that the book offers id choose the following:<br />1. Choose a loveable project<br />2. Divide skills in sub-skills<br />3. Choose 3-5 resources<br />4. Study in short burst of 20 minutes

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Kudos to Brandon Sanderson.  I am currently looking for more series he has written.  He is imaginative and his use of common medals in providing powers and special features to the person ingesting them was a very creative, unique idea.  I am fascinated by the details and character development he spent so much time on.  He is a gifted writer.

B0085YOD1A|4.0|the app is helpful and has a moslty accurate guess to how much longer a your battery will last. it has some things like how hot your device is or what health its in. it would be nice to have something that could tell you what apps use the most juice and what you can do to conserve energy. other than that its a great app.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a fun &amp; addictive racing game. Offers MANY different challenges &amp; scenarios that holds your attention &amp; it is FREE!! Don't let the &quot;use actual money&quot; scare you... You can unlock all levels and buy upgrades just by playing because the points or coins add up very quickly. The one DISTURBING element is when the car flips over and the driver supposedly breaks or snaps his neck and the sound it makes is VERY realistic &amp; is quite CREEPY!! You need to get RID of that sound!! If not for the neck snapping sounds it would be a FIVE star game. The music itself is not annoying! PLEASE get rid of that sound!!!

B00COO2D6O|3.0|Even though you have to buy the game it's full of in app purchases and attempts to get your facebook and twitter logons, so it can post junk on your pages. I would expect this for a free game but not a paid game. Check out Myth Defense for a similar gaming with out all the in-app annoyances.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|From the perspective of an 11 year old boy: It's fun and challenging.  Great for long bus/car rides.  It almost looks like artwork and your parents won't mind if you leave it in the living room.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|man, cole REALLY delivered on 'born sinner' its so far ahead of his debut album which i could NOT get into at all. The album starts off well with 'villuminati' which features a famous biggie sample that fits in so perfectly. The song came under fire from over sensitive critics that focus on single words instead of listening to everything cole has to say but im not gonna get into that. This is the first album ive bought in a long time that feels like hit after hit when im playing it.<br />My top 5 changes often but right now i would have to say that it's, villuminati, rich ni***z, ni***z know(deluxe), land of the snakes and new york times(deluxe). I advise everyone that buys this album to buy the deluxe edition, it's worth it, the five bonus tracks aka 'Truly Yours, 3' are on a seperate disc. 'Born Sinner' is my AOTY so far(easy choice) and will most likely remain that. J. Cole may not outsell Kanye's 'Yeezus' but it's definately a much better listen for me.<br />Finally, if it's dope hip hop you are looking for then you cant go wrong with this, COP IT AND SUPPORT DOPE MUSIC.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|This is a candid account of John Locke's rise to fame and fortune on the back of a cleverly crafted yet essentially trashy set of novels.<br /><br />What I like about this explanation of his success is the sense that he does not really care a damn about the writing itself. Forget the Great American Novel or even trying to be a successor to  Flaubert, Hemingway, Capote, Tolstoy or Zola - this is unashamedly pulp fiction and it is how he has persuaded us to buy this stuff that is the subject of this guide.<br /><br />Its full o useful tips but the bottom line is that you that you have to apply as much imagination to the selling of your work as you do in writing the stuff in the first place. This book, therefore, is as good a place to start as any other of the dozens of writers' guides currently on the market.

B000JMKRKC|3.0|The storyteller only picks up halfway through the book but there are some good twists. At times it feels as though the book drags on a bit too much. I also felt as though the main character whined far too much about her problems and often felt like she just needed to get over herself. Perhaps it is because I can't stand frail female characters.

B00DF0POXA|4.0|Overall this is a fantasic album that I've listened to front to back about 3 times in the few hours that I have owned it, however it seems as though Amazon is supplying a different version of this album than iTunes. The biggest difference is on \\"Send it up\\" at 1:28 when Kanye says \\"I might ride around on my bodyguard back like Prince in the club.\\" The iTunes version is different in that the beat cuts off for that entire line, which can be heard on the iTunes sample of the song. It's possible there are other differences between the two versions of the album so this is definitely something to watch out for when purchasing this download. Hopefully Amazon can find out if they have the correct version from the label and update accordingly.<br /><br />Edit: another difference I've found is that Black Skinhead is mastered differently to sound more dynamic on the iTunes version, especially during the intro.
B00AEBB8XS|4.0|This cult favourite is as much a historical document as it is a story of doing what it takes to make it home again when the whole city is against you. With it's period street-talk and oppressive ambience, this 1979 film is as edgy today as it was during the &#34;gang movie&#34; era of the late '70s. Time warp.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|The band has said that this album was inspired by The Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Hollies and Bee Gees. It is evident upon hearing it that they were not kidding. This is a trip right back to the swinging sixties. If you heard some of these tunes on the radio you would be excused for thinking you were listening to an oldies station.<br /><br />But it's not all sixties. There are several songs which sound current. One easily confused with Oasis might be `Standing On The Edge Of The Noise', which shares its name with one an Oasis concert video. `Kill For A Dream' is typical of mellow Oasis. And the guitars are let loose on `Four Letter Word', a slam bang rocker in the old Oasis vein. It starts the album with what may be a jab at Noel.<br /><br />\\"The battle is on and the song is the prize.\\"<br /><br />Let loose from the tight grip of their previous leader, this rock group drops the serious attitude and goes right for the gusto. Musically and lyrically it is catchy and cool, and like when your Mum's left the house and the toys and liquor are all yours, this record is all about fun.<br /><br />\\"Well here's my glass and here's one for you<br />'Cause these dark glasses need something to do\\"<br /><br />1963: The first single the band put out was `Bring The Light', and they might have done it as a reaction to Noel, who would never allow girl singers or the word \\"Baby\\" on an Oasis record. It took most people by surprise as it sounds so old fashion, like The Beatles doing Jerry Lee Lewis and his boogie woogie piano. Retro was not what people were expecting.<br /><br />1964: `Beatles And Stones' oddly enough sounds more like The Who than the bands it is named after. It is a pumping little romper that is very basic, all groove. It shows their ego will not be kept in check.<br /><br />1965: `For Anyone' is a beautiful jaunty jangly number done on folk guitars that could fit perfectly on \\"Beatles For Sale\\" or \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\".  Not only does it sound right for the time, it is only two minutes long! `Wind Up Dream' with its harmonica is The Beatles once again, and it shows just how good these guys are at refining that classic sound into pristine, polished pop. U2 producer Steve Lillywhite did a fine job with the sound on this record. All the instruments are clear and the bass is always on an even keel, never overbearing. And Liam's singing is as good as ever.<br /><br />\\"Solid gold glints in your eye<br />A cheeky grin that really makes me smile\\"<br /><br />1966: `The Beat Goes On' reminds me more of the Kinks than Sonny And Cher. Melodic and flowing, it is a natural. These guys aren't punkers, they are the love generation. Its B side beauty, `In A Bubble With A Bullet' should have been put on this album as well. It is just a perfect pop song, sixties flower power all the way. `Three Ring Circus' sounds like a \\"Revolver\\" track the Beatles never knew they recorded. Just another perfect pop song on this record. Once again, this shows Noel knew what he was doing when he hired these two new guitarists.<br /><br />1967: The oddly named `Wigwam' might be the only psychedelic track on the album. It is for sure the longest. It seems to be about partying all night and then making up with the wife. It is an album highlight, though I prefer the dramatic guitar attack they use on the end when they play it live, compared to the fade out on the record. I guess the idea is to be up, up and away and with the repeating refrain of `coming up\\" it does work itself up into a glorified happy song.<br /><br />1968: `Millionaire' sounds like the Kinks doing \\"Beggars Banquet\\". This absolutely gorgeous tune is one of two songs about being driven in a car by someone else. We are dealing here with people who have a lot of money. They don't drive their own cars. They have someone do it for them. A far cry from the humble beginnings of Oasis when they did not have a car and had to travel by yellow submarine. What may be the bands most famous song, `The Roller', also sounds like it could have come out that year. The recording itself, production wise, sounds like it would have been right at home in the white album era. It was Gem's first Oasis song, written for \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" but for some reason it did not make it on that album. Noel described it as T Rex playing `Instant Karma', a fitting description.<br /><br />If the first song was a jab at Noel, then the last surely is a love song for him. Liam won't admit that but one thing for sure is that `Morning Son' is the most beautiful and deep song on the album. Its strumming folk guitar, slide guitar, tambourine and ocean waves make this tune seem like a daydream. `Morning Son' is timeless and a lovely end to a brilliant record, a record much better than I ever expected out of them. The beauty of that is I never expected another Oasis album, especially one with the band we have here. Who knew that Liam would be the one the others would stick with? We always thought he was the trouble maker. Now it looks like Noel was Napoleon.<br /><br />After Oasis broke up I had nothing to do with them. It was not until after I had a heart attack that summer that I found out that Beady Eye even existed. I grabbed their CD right away and it has been in my car ever since, easily my most played album of the last two years. With the exception of the last Duran album and \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\", if I had died, music wise I would have missed nothing. That is how good this album is. It was worth living for.<br /><br />\\"Thought that I died today<br />Walked off the stage<br />Faded away up through the clouds<br />To the gig in the sky<br />And when I arrived, the angels were singing this song<br />Yeah you know the one, are you singing along?\\"ds like it could have come out that year.

B005ERX1Z0|5.0|Good clean fun from start to finish. Joke after joke, great cars and a who's who of Hollywood royalty, ably assisted by &#34;him&#34; make this a comedy classic for every generation.
B00CELB94E|4.0|If you were expecting something that sounds like Oasis, or even \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\", your expectations may not be met. The band spread the word last year that the next Beady Eye record would be psychedelic, and nothing like the first album. Well they were half right. There are no psychedelics here to speak of. I was expecting `'Dig Out Your Soul\\" and I got something that matches the lovely Herb Alpert cover instead.<br /><br />Oasis Light and Other Delights.<br /><br />Let's give Columbia Records some credit for releasing an album with a semi-nude woman on the cover. Herb never had it so good. You may notice that some of the song styles seem to match the album cover and could easily be used in adverts to sell beauty products on TV. They are that happy, inoffensive and commercial. This is much more a pop album than a rock album. It is good, but it isn't \\"Different\\".<br /><br />The album starts out with the roar of `Flick of the Finger'.  Steady state chords and a frontal wave of horns come right at you. Hearing this and looking at the cover may remind you of Herb Alpert alright, Herb Alpert gone mad. The guitars are barley present, enveloped as they are in this wave of sound. Right when you are thinking this might be a great album a voice comes on reminding you that with the flick of a finger nuclear war could be upon us. I disagree of course, the aliens on and around this planet would never allow that. But I digress...<br /><br />`Soul Love' comes next and its soft delicate beat matches the album cover, but it is in total contrast to the album opener. This is not a Bowie copy, nor is it your typical romance song. It is more about mood, and the mood is pleasant. The song ends with a long quiet fade out which Gem calls an out of body experience. It would have been good for setting the mood.<br /><br />Except that they thunder back in with `Face The Crowd'. This song sounds unlike the rest. It is fast with a heavy handed beat but it does have a nice change in verse and a blasting but too short lead solo. Nice clapping section too. So we have heavy/light/heavy in the first 3 songs. It would have made more sense to keep the heavier songs together.<br /><br />`Second Bite of the Apple' would have fallen in nicely after `Soul Love' as it fits the vibe better after the latter's long outro. This was the first \\"Be\\" song I heard and at first listen this one threw me, it did not sound like their first record at all. It starts with bass and off beat drums, then percussion and what... vibraphone? Then Liam comes in raw, talking like he is right in front of you and wanting to know what Eve did with the fruit. This evolves into a backing with horns ganging up on a chorus. Then the entire thing repeats one more time before stopping instantly. Totally unlike anything Beady or Oasis has ever done and darn good.<br /><br />`Soon Come Tomorrow'. The bubble gum chewing bass player that I first saw standing on the stage during the \\"Giants\\" tour has shown a true melodic gift when it comes to writing pop songs. Andy wrote the more upbeat tracks found on this album, not something I would have expected after his \\"dream\\" songs. But his strong lead solo here is too short and not given enough time to develop. This tune also ends with a short fading musical section.<br /><br />`Iz Rite' is reminiscent of the energy and innocence of \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\". It sounds somewhat sixtyish and bouncy and with its layered chorus it is easy to see Justin Bieber and a convertible full of preteens singing along with it. It ends with jangly guitars but the music never seems to stand above the singing. Good song this one.<br /><br />`I'm Just Saying' is another fast Andy song. Liam calls it the Monkees sound. It has long stretches of singing with drum beat which get picked up by guitar runs. It hooks you with its beat and bop. Then it goes for the good times with its count by number backing vocals. This is a happy song that would have fit on theirfirst album.<br /><br />`Don't Brother Me'. When I first heard this I thought \\"don't bother me with this song again\\". I was getting bored with its simple lyric and style, and then I noticed it was only halfway over. It then drifted into a cool spacey vibe. Jeff Wootton established the bass line for this whch everyone worked around. Then he surprised everyone by saying he was not going to tour with the band anymore. It would have been nice if they could have done more with this part and less with the opening. This peaceful comedown might have been best used at the end of the album. The ending is pure minimalism, not shaken, not stirred, its Beady Eye chilled.<br /><br />Come back Jeff, all is forgiven!<br /><br />`Shine A Light' starts off with piano and strings, like a movie opening, its Andy's Scarface. Then it gets into a percussion grove and turns into a whole different sound. This is one of the most rocking songs on the album, but it still uses acoustic guitars to do it. This is not a Stones copy, more like U2's `Desire', which means it does nothing for me. But this album is a grower, so maybe I will grow to like it.<br /><br />`Ballroom Figured' is Gem's sweet little gem. A touching song played by one guitar. Liam's plaintive voice adds just the right feel to it. Originally it had piano, bass and drums, but during the mix they decided to stay with the single guitar. It does the job and sets a place at the table for our next song.<br /><br />`Start Anew' is a soft little acoustic song. Just a simple, short romantic number. It might remind one of `Married With Children', just a coda at the end of the album. But the whole album has been fading out up to this point anyway. So it is almost like the music is fading away. But electric guitars come in and add a little extra at the end. That's it for the standard album. Good job boys.<br /><br />Still the album has been coming down for some time and if you hear `Dreaming Of Some Space' right after this it really does seem like a coda sitting on the end. If you do not already know, this B side of `Apple' is part of `Anew' backwards. Dreamy, like the cover image, it too would have been a great ending.<br /><br />But the album keeps going with `The World's Not Set In Stone'. This song might have been the first of the new tunes, as it was played live a year ago. A soft tune, it relies on acoustic guitar and keyboard strings until the end, where it gets a sprinkling of piano and crazed sixties electric guitar.<br /><br />`Back After The Break' is one of the best songs from the \\"Be\\" collection. This one should have been on the standard album. Sure it is just a mellow tune but it has everything that Beady Eye does right. Nice melody, chord progression, singing thought and the recording sounds like it is coming from a radio lost in time.<br /><br />`Off At The Next Exit' might be the best song from \\"Be\\". It is just perfect, and sad, and beautiful, all at the same time. Once again everything is just right. Piano, soft drumming and soulful singing. This ends the deluxe album in a lovely way. If Beady Eye never makes another song, this one was a great one to go out on.<br /><br />There are 2 more new songs floating around Japan. `Girls In Uniform' seems like a total British tune. It skips along on drums outlined by guitar picking for 4 minutes, then a keyboard comes in to lighten the mood, which then stretches out another 2 minutes before it ends in simple piano notes.<br /><br />Then there is `Evil Eye', a nice melody built around guitar, drums and vocals. Strings come into the picture, followed by a guitar break that is not actually a solo, but more like accompaniment. It comes back at the end, where once again we fade away with piano notes. This too is one of their best songs. Another great piece that, as everyone says, should have been on the album!<br /><br />It would be interesting to know why the band chose some songs to be on the proper album and chose to leave others off. Most fansare already saying that the extra tracks are more than worthy. To me, all of them are better than `Crowd', `Shine' and `Brother'.<br /><br />It will also be interesting to see how the Oasis crowd takes to this album, because it is much slower and softer than the first Beady Eye album. Unlike the paid critics who spend more time complaining about Liam than listening to the songs themselves, the fans will find that once they get over the initial shock of how mellow the record is, the songs will reveal more depth than originally thought. And the more they listen to it the more they will like it. The band has given us an 11 track record, but they have given us 6 extra tracks. If you replace the original tracks with the extras that you prefer then you will have an 11 track album that is really good. This fact makes this album extremely hard for me to rate. I find it is not as good as \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\" but better than `Be Here Now\\". So is it a 4 or 5 star album?<br /><br />Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If Amazon gave a 10 star rating my eyes see 8 stars.<br /><br />This is definitely their most mature album since \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\".  But this is not a copy of what they have done before, here they are growing out and reaching up and they sound more original than ever before. This is the new sound of Beady Eye.<br /><br />I expect a proud Noel will be wearing a BE shirt under his jacket for quite some time. Secretly telling people, \\"That's my band mate, I handpicked them all.\\"eem like a coda sitting on the end. If you do not already know, this B side of `Apple' is part of `Anew' backwards. Dreamy, like the cover image, it too would have been a great ending.<br /><br />But the album keeps going with `The World's Not Set In Stone'. This song might have been the first of the new tunes, as it was played live a year ago. A soft tune, it relies on acoustic guitar and keyboard strings until the end, where it gets a sprinkling of piano and crazed sixties electric guitar.<br /><br />`Back After The Break' is one of the best songs from the \\"Be\\" collection. This one should have been on the standard album. Sure it is just a mellow tune but it has everything that Beady Eye does right. Nice melody, chord progression, singing thought and the recording sounds like it is coming from a radio lost in time.<br /><br />`Off At The Next Exit' might be the best song from \\"Be\\". It is just perfect, and sad, and beautiful, all at the same time. Once again everything is just right. Piano, soft drumming and soulful singing. This ends the deluxe album in a lovely way. If Beady Eye never makes another song, this one was a great one to go out on.<br /><br />There are 2 more new songs floating around Japan. `Girls In Uniform' seems like a total British tune. It skips along on drums outlined by guitar picking for 4 minutes, then a keyboard comes in to lighten the mood, which then stretches out another 2 minutes before it ends in simple piano notes.<br /><br />Then there is `Evil Eye', a nice melody built around guitar, drums and vocals. Strings come into the picture, followed by a guitar break that is not actually a solo, but more like accompaniment. It comes back at the end, where once again we fade away with piano notes. This too is one of their best songs. Another great piece that, as everyone says, should have been on the album!<br /><br />It would be interesting to know why the band chose some songs to be on the proper album and chose to leave others off. Most fansare already saying that the extra tracks are more than worthy. To me, all of them are better than `Crowd', `Shine' and `Brother'.<br /><br />It will also be interesting to see how the Oasis crowd takes to this album, because it is much slower and softer than the first Beady Eye album. Unlike the paid critics who spend more time complaining about Liam than listening to the songs themselves, the fans will find that once they get over the initial shock of how mellow the record is, the songs will reveal more depth than originally thought. And the more they listen to it the more they will like it. The band has given us an 11 track record, but they have given us 6 extra tracks. If you replace the original tracks with the extras that you prefer then you will have an 11 track album that is really good. This fact makes this album extremely hard for me to rate. I find it is not as good as \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\" but better than `Be Here Now\\". So is it a 4 or 5 star album?<br /><br />Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If Amazon gave a 10 star rating my eyes see 8 stars.<br /><br />This is definitely their most mature album since \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\".  But this is not a copy of what they have done before, here they are growing out and reaching up and they sound more original than ever before. This is the new sound of Beady Eye.<br /><br />I expect a proud Noel will be wearing a BE shirt under his jacket for quite some time. Secretly telling people, \\"That's my band mate, I handpicked them all.\\"
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Pretty much what you would expect from a slash album.  Unlike the first one, instead of having a guest singer for each song, he sticks with Myles Kennedy through the whole album.  Quite frankly, the two Myles Kennedy songs at Slash's first solo album were my favorites anyways.  If you like GnR and Velvet Revolver, you will not regret this purchase.
0307950689|3.0|I guess I'm a Dan Brown fan because I actually finished this despite the fact that it was not one of his best. The trouble was that I found the villain completely hilarious. Every time we were in his head, listening to him think, it was just so melodramatic that I couldn't take him seriously. Langdon's work kept the plot moving, but I have to be honest that I was disappointed in the ending. I won't spoil it, but it was a lot of work for little payoff.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|I've had this watch for about 3 months; it's functional and meets my standards for looks. My ONLY critique is that I thought I would get more winding while I wore the watch. I have about 6 other watches, so I don't often wear the same watch 2 days in a row. I've found that wearing the watch for only day causes the watch to stop about 12 hours after I remove it. I also have the blue version of this watch and it occurs with both.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|Notebooks helps me keep things from my life and younger siblings.<br />They also help me with my dog walking business. That's why I recommend NOTEBOOKS for younger children like me and old hags like others!
B006CHML4I|4.0|This is exactly what I expected. However, I was surprised at the packaging, the watch was on a pillow, yes a pillow. It shipped quickly and I received it before it was scheduled.<br /><br />Update: After having this watch for 3 months now, I'm a little surprised that I need to reset it so often. I have about 6 other watches, so I don't often wear the same one 2 days in a row. Once I remove the watch it will need to be reset after about 12 hours of sitting motionless.
0765324857|4.0|I chose this title because of my love for the bioshock series and i felt it would explain a little more into the backstory of the universe. It does this quite well and is a good read.
0679805273|5.0|This was a great grad gift idea, especially when you have 20 different grads to buy for in the same year.  My sophomore wanted to read it, too.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is super fun but some of my friends don't like it. It is just like super Mario bros and you get to explore different worlds! :)
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I love these movies as does my 5 year old niece.  They are fun and have lessons of sorts that take me back to 80s cartoons--which were the best.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|the best, i really enjoy playing this cool game. very addicting also. so if you like to decorate and create fun things, this game is for you!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Sorry if this review seems thin, trying my best to avoid spoilers!<br /><br />After Eva 1.11 you were probably expecting that 2.22 and 3.33 would be fairly in line with the original series. They aren't. The plot starts to diverge from the Evangelion universe we knew and loved and starts to become something different, kinda like a relative or friend we knew years ago who has grown up and is now a different person. That being said, some of the scenes sent shivers down my spine, so many of the possibilities for the original series that never became due to time or money are now portrayed in full form. This was not a low budget thrown together project.<br /><br />If you never saw the original series, expect for all of the characters to have their own agendas, often conflicting. Never believe anything you are told, because everyone is lying to everyone else, and sometimes themselves. Just buckle up and enjoy the wonderful ride!<br /><br />If you saw the original series, expect to have a slight leg up when watching 2.22. You already know some of the secrets, and you already know that everyone is lying! Just try to treat it as a separate work or you will end up with a book vs movie kind of internal conflict.<br /><br />Oh and 3.33 gets even better!
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was surprisingly fun and entertaining for me and all of my friends and family whom I was able to convince to watch it. Trust me when I say that you have not seen screen chemistry like this in a long time. The sci-fi elements are exciting to see. The adventure unravels in such coherent and heart touching manner that you immediately relate to the characters and are invested in their lives.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is a handsome, charming, and disarming leading man whose mixture of roguishness and soft heartedness can't help but win you over. Lynn Collins is an exotic beauty with strength, passion, and provocative spice that encapsulates what one would expect of a Princess of Mars.<br /><br />The chemistry between these two has you rooting for them to get together and win the entire film. You care about these people, even the alien Tharks, and their world and their fate.<br /><br />Adventure, compassion, love all set on a fantastic exotic/erotic world. What more can you ask for?!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One commenter noted that the grammar was a bit odd. I agree. At first, Mr. Ryan's grammar, certain long sentences, became cumbersome.<br /><br />But honestly... you quickly get so absorbed by the story that you forget all of that. This book is like a snowball rolling down a mountain side.<br /><br />Once the book got going, I couldn't put it down. I read for 12 hours straights, finishing about 87% of the book. Then, today, I finished the remaining 13% (according to how this Kindle processed things). Frankly, I'm going to go back and start reading it again tomorrow morning. By the end of the book, you don't want to leave. You want to join the main character, Vaelin Al Sorna, once again.<br /><br />For fans of Patrick Rothfuss' 'Name of The Wind,' there are a lot of similarities. How the story is told, how it unfolds, etc. I can pay Mr. Ryan no greater compliment than saying his character, and this world he has created, are as awe-inspiring and wonderful as Kvothe and his realm. And for me, that says a lot. Those were probably my favorite books in over a decade. Now I have an existential crisis on my hands.<br /><br />I also loved that you -like- the character. Too many people are on a kick about making you dislike the protagonist and everyone else. By the end, you truly care about the character, his fate, and where his journey will take him next.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is intimacy, though not of the obscene sort that George R.R. Martin or R. Scott Bakker are so fond of. His treatment of prostitutes, intercourse, etc, are handle very carefully. They're never going to derail you, but they are used just enough to make the story that much more believable. I hate romance, but enjoyed how he executed it.<br /><br />The fight scenes? Well, the fight scenes... they're breathtakingly vivid. You feel the wind of every spear flying by your cheek, the throb of every sword collision.<br /><br />Anthony Ryan, you are a master.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, just jump. Buy the book. If you don't like it... well, you need to get evaluated by a medical professional and re-read it.<br /><br />I'll be re-reading it and sending Mr. Ryan angry message to speed up the 2nd book.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|this is a movie for all ages.  It shows how circumstances can change people.  In order to stay in the USA a young woman lies to agent and says she is engaged to a co-worker.  She is not liked by anyone in the office.  They think she is mean and disrespectful.  When she comes into contact with this co-workers family something happens.  She gets feelings she never had before.  A great movie.  Makes you laugh and and also makes you understand what can change people.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I typically do not care for films that span several generations and slide back and forth from one time point to the next, and then back again only to lose me along the way. This movie is very much the same but this is where any similarity ends. The difference I believe that lent to the overall cohesiveness was a message running just below the surface which prevented it from appearing to be chopped here and inserted there.<br /><br />Many complained about not understanding what was being said and admittedly, I suffered this same dilemma at first. After listening for a short while I was able to understand what was being spoken and surprisingly, portions even sounded Creole. Once I \\"adjusted\\" my ears, so to speak, I had no problem following what was being relayed.  My suggestion is to step back and relax. Do not (but do) get caught up in the kaleidoscope of characters, the cinematography, and timelines.  This is a film that must be viewed more with your heart than with your mind and eyes. It's the caring and the connections people can experience with one another without having to know the \\"why\\".  What brought it together and tied this film \\"together\\" in a neat package was this underlying theme that ran throughout its entirety and was touchingly defined by Somni during her interview. If there ever was a time to say I was wowed, it's now.<br /><br />This movie is quite frankly, one of the finest expeditions into cinematography I have had the pleasure of experiencing. The depth and versatility of the cast was phenomenal and the script was even more so. Cloud Atlas will not appeal to some but it sure touched my heart and for the entire length of the film I was not bored one iota.  I found it a truly original film that will remain one of the finest I've had the pleasure of viewing. My sincerest admiration and thanks to David Mitchell.  To be is to be perceived.

0811879542|5.0|My daughter was delighted with this book. When my husband read it to her, she was automatically pulled into the book. She said it was like playing an app, but it's a book. I love how you interact with this book, the colors, the direction, and the excitement to find out what will happen next. My daughters are 3 and 1, and they both love to \\"Press Here\\".
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This was  heart warming story of the struggles of a middle schooler.... auggie is an inspiration. This is a great book for a teacher to 'read aloud' to the class.
006079383X|3.0|Not bad. Good information so far but most of which I already know.<br />Just informative but no real secrets. Puts you to sleep easy for sure.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Probably the most believable Wyoming crime thriller I've read.  The characters' sense of humor resonates.  Johnson captured enough of the Wyoming wind to put it on paper for readers to experience what it means to living in Wyoming.  He's created real Indians.  Powerful ending.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|Maiden Live! Saw this tour in Sacramento...Guns N Roses were supposed to open & they cancelled. So Maiden played their FULL European set!<br /><br />Up the Irons!

B005CK76ZA|5.0|Really the only reason to get this is you collect LP's of bad ass music and your friends will think your cool. Hipsters need not buy this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i enjoy this app...keeps you thinking....I like searching for items and codes that'll lead to more levels that become more challenging then the previous....
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Loved it!  Her psy/changeling series is outstanding.  Love the characters the air of fun the changelings have make look forward to the next book.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Every time I buy an animal habitat it crashes, it not only crashes the game but sometimes I have to do a hard restart, this list time re started over ten times. Still ..won't work.<br /><br />It takes all my acorns ( real cash) never to be seen again. As well as coins and the item I attempted to purchase, weather it be with coins or acorns.<br /><br />I thought I could play alone, but it continually asks you to sign on to Face Book and add friends.<br /><br />I'm looking for a game that keeps social net works out of it. If anyone knows of one let me know.<br /><br />I will be deleting this game as now it will not load at all.<br /><br />Be VERY careful, or you can easily spend cash even with parental controls on, I am an adult that keeps parental controls on at all times as these games are quite ingenious at taking your cash, and giving nothing in return.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My wife and I watched this in the theaters and enjoyed it enough to want to buy a copy to watch at home.  The action, humor, effects, and chemistry between the actors is great.  Can't wait for the second movie to come out!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I was reviewing several knives for the last 30 days, I bought a Gerber LMFII Black Infantry, I really like it, but I happened upon the SCHF9 videos, so I convinced myself to get it, the price was $45.00 at Amazon, free shipping. The knife is great,1/4&#34; thick full tang blade, at 12&#34; long. The handle really feels nice, now I doubt if I will ever be chopping down &#34;Oak Trees&#34; for firewood, but the knife would make a very useful tool, and it's affordable. Good job Schrade.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|My wife and I have been building this slowly over the past several months, and it's been a pleasure.  As amazing as the finished product is, the amount of detail that LEGO put into the construction process is even more phenomenal.  This is a great build, and I would do it over.  One thing to note is that, in my opinion, this particular set is purely a display piece and is not feasible as a play set.
B000O176Q6|5.0|of course, I feel it is the greatest Martial Arts film ever made, why? Because Hollywood took notice (finally) of Bruce Lee's talent, not only being the greatest Martial Artist of the 20th century, but very savy in  designing the fight scenes.<br />Wehn the movie came out, I went (through that circuit) to the movie house & watched it a total of 120 times. & God only knows how many times I've seen it on video & DVD. Some would say I am crazy or exacurate. But it is the truth, after work at a bank I worked at, I went & saw it on a Tues, then Thur, then I would come one Saturday, my day off. Why? because I had known of Bruce Lee since the Green Hornet & then when his earlier movies came out. Being a martial artist myself, I was facinated by his abilities....
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its cool to see how low my battery is and how long till its fully charged and a good estimate of how long i can play/read on my kindle before it dies its a must download
B008QQP34I|5.0|great movie, great format! thoughroughly enjoyed it! Tom Cruise is crasy to hang out of a building that high. But he is a commited actor & artist & one can only admire him for that. Keep making great movies Tom, we will go out & see them.
0670026557|4.0|Very insightful from both an internal and external POV. It  encourages the reader to do an honest self-assessment as well as a relational one. If you are asking what it is that is holding you or others back this will be helpful.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Give it a try, the style takes a while to kick in but I found  it entertaining. Good summer read.
0307120007|2.0|The shape of this book is strange to hold in your hand. We never wanted to read it to baby because it he didn't even like it when WE picked it up to bring to him.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It's awesome I have lots of fun creating looks and adding makeup. You should try it it's great. You will have lots of fun.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I think this album is amazing! He speaks on real problems going on in the world and that plenty of people are struggling with on a daily basis. There are also some just-having-fun tracks. Great motivational tracks with amazing beats. Way better than the junk on the radio that's ruining the name of rap. This is one true piece of art. He is now one of my favorite rappers. This should be what people refer to when they want to introduce someone to rap. Everything comes together so nicely. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. You won't be disappointed! (Unless you're a fan of rappers talking about waking up in bugatti's and strippers dancing and whatnot)
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game cool me my brother and my dad love this game. I think you will love it to. Plus I love driveing.<br />THANK YOU FOR READING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is a mind-bender of a movie, but it was beautifully done. Love the commentary items, it can help with things you might be confused about in the movie. Very well done.
1616614609|5.0|This game is really interesting. Asynchronous game-play is drastic with unique objects and strategies. I'm a huge fan of the cyber punk theme and this game does a great job of fleshing the theme throughout its game play and art style. Lets just say I immediately purchased as many expansions as i could get a hold of.
B00B2OSZIW|5.0|Not the cheapest, but like the camera, very well built. The grip makes the camera feel better in the hands.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is fun but I finished all the levels in like an hour. I can not wait for more levels. I feel like I will become addicted if they make enough levels
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game to play and it is not as hard as it seems.  It's a good challenge for your brain and increases your problem solving ability.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|This filter snaps on and off quickly, and has a tether you can attach. I haven't gotten as much use out of it as I would like, but so far the pictures/videos I have taken are looking pretty good.
0525953728|5.0|The book came in good condition, but when I received it there was sticky stuff with a hair on it on the front cover which kind of annoyed me. I managed to clean whatever it was off with a damp towel. There was a price sticker on the front of it also, but that came off very easily. Other than that the book was in great condition.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|A very well written book that I couldn't stop reading, Reading it felt like watching a great thriller with a lot of excitements. I really enjoyed all the twists and mysteries of this book and looking forward to the movie releasing soon staring Nicole Kidman.

1936719118|5.0|Fabulous easy read; brilliantly simple wisdoms.<br />Handy hints; able to act upon immediately.<br />This little book is a delightful read over a cup of coffee
B00BR0SEAK|3.0|I have several DP albums, my favorites being \\"Perfect Strangers,\\" \\"House of Blue Light\\" and \\"The Battle Rages On.\\"  After Blackmore left, I had little interest in DP, but decided to give this latest lineup a test drive.  Though there are a couple of good songs (my favorite being the opener), the overall feel of the album is that it is nothing but a shadow of what it once was.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|I waited sooooo  long like everyone for this book. It took me by surprise in the end who Sookie ended up with. I was heart broken no happy Charlaine
B00CA4S27W|5.0|I have nearly all of Blackmore's Night compilations and some I like more than others, my favorites being &#34;Shadow of the Moon,&#34; &#34;Under a Violet Moon, &#34;Village Lantern&#34; and now...&#34;Dancer and the Moon&#34; (my least favorite being &#34;Secret Voyage&#34;).  This latest from Ex Deep Purple/Rainbow guitar virtuoso Ritchie Blackmore came out of the gate a little wooden, but by the time song three rolled around--bam!, the glow of the album began to take shape and did not cease until the very end.  Being a long-time guitarist myself, I can really appreciate why Ritchie felt the need to move from Hard Rock to renaissance music as I too have moved from playing mostly heavy metal to a more folkish/Celtic finger-picking style because it is often more complex and gratifying.  Similarly, like Ritchie, I sill shred with the best of em' and you too can hear his rock-roots shine through in many of his Blackmore's Night songs.<br /><br />On that note, Blackmore usually likes to remake some of his old Rainbow songs with Candice, infusing a Renaissance flair and, being a die-hard Rainbow fan, I usually prefer the originals.  However, &#34;Dancer and the Moon's&#34; rendition of &#34;The Temple of the King&#34; seemed like it was made specifically for this new album and to be frank--I think prefer this song over the original 1975 version (which is saying a lot!).  Since I did not care for the first two songs on &#34;Dancer and the Moon,&#34; one may ask why then I rated the album an overall &#34;5?&#34;  The answer is because the remaining tunes more than makes up for a slow start, so I consider the lesser songs &#34;bonus material&#34; in the wrong place.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|I am saddened to see so many mediocre reviews, I LOVED it ! Its is not a remake. It tells the wizards story, how he ended up in Oz and I love how the wicked witches stories tie in... Going to buy it tomorrow !
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Story of his experience well documented and presented. it was convincing and detailed in such a way to be difficult to refute.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The only trouble i see herein is that the user has a real life to live and has to perform something different than play all day long ...
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The game teaches new concepts really well because it kind of shows what needs to be done but leaves a small challenge.  The puzzles increase in difficulty in such a manner that frustration is reduced.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Not perfect at the moment.  In the original, there was so much more.  I like what I see in this one so far, but more needs to be done.  The original was so diverse in the weapon types.  There are a lot of  major WWII weapons missing.  The creators should have done a little bit more with it before releasing it.  In a couple updates, it should be a great ap though.  Hopefully, this one turns into a full collection of the weapons used in WWII.  Great so far, keep on working.

B004JN1CW4|5.0|Wow this book ended fast I really don't want this series to end but I guess it has to. James Dashner even said himself ite Acknowlegements in this book that this book has become another world for him and I completely agree. James Dashner I have all of your books so please write more! For all those fans out there are debating whether to read this series, I highly suggest for.you to read it!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, in particular.  Ponyo is super sweet and cute and works well with even very young audiences.  I like that there is no 'bad guy' or 'scary evil', just differences of opinion and curiosity that create the tension and yet still the story is strong and imaginative and the characters are lively and lovable.  Love, friendship, and acceptance are the main themes.  Sorry I made it sound pretty gooey; I'm not the best at reviewing...it's also interesting and clever (and has Liam Neeson), which qualifies it as cool too.  It's just one of my favorite Studio Ghibli for younger kids, along with My Neighbor Totoro (I love many, but these have younger kids as their main characters.)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's awesome! In my opinion it is way better than temple run this game...I don't know it's just awesome I love it! I give this game 5 stars!
0307887960|5.0|This book is a must have if you are someone who has tried everything to lose weight and still can't. It is a good way to learn about nutrition and easy to work into a busy lifestyle. You can still eat out while following this diet. I lost 40 pounds and have kept it off for two years.
0792844890|2.0|Surprising, being big fan of Mel Brooks, neither my wife nor I had ever seen this movie. And unfortunately, it is not one we will see again as we gave the disc away in a group of items to the local Goodwill.<br /><br />Brooks's creation in the late 1980s was one of his many humorous tributes to other movies (High Anxiety, HA) or overall sendups of situations (Blazing Saddles, BS). They were funny.<br /><br />Here the target was George Lucas’s Star Wars “empire.”<br /><br />This parody was not funny. Some of it was, at best, was cute: John Candy with a tail that stroked a waitress, a Winnebago as the foundation of a supposedly low-tech space ship, the Darth Vader character as a huge black helmet (Lord Dark Helmet), Brooks recasting his Governor William J. Lepetomane character in BS as President Skroob, and many others all cute.<br /><br />But, there was no global satire of racism and race as in BS or homage to a genre of Alfred Hitchcock films as in HA. No greatness; just cuteness. I didn’t think Mel Brooks did cute. But in Spaceballs, he filled a whole movie with cute.
B006LL5W6O|4.0|Thought this was a very cute movie.Great special effects & fun characters.Bring together several different fairy tale stories to create this movie.Found it interesting:)
1451695195|4.0|Seems that people love this book or hate it.  I'm not sure it will convince those cynics who believe this earthly life is all there is, but for those of us looking for evidence that there is something more, this book is very compelling.  I found it hard to put down, and oddly comforting, reinforcing a belief I have until now had to take on faith.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|Horrible Horrible movie. I really dont like posting negative stuff online or just about anything, but every now and then when something sucks soooooooo bad or I feel like I recieved horrible service at a restuarant or ect., I NEEEEED to write a review and warn people about it. So yeah. This movie was HORRIBLE. Stay away please. Stay AWWWWAAAAYYYYYY.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|This light feels like the wave of the bike-riding future--fun, safe, and 100% professional. To this add clever, since it converts wheel motion into visibility. The feeling of safety while I'm using it is so strong, I'd never ride again at night without it.<br /><br />The device is so attention-grabbing, I get questions from curious onlookers even when it's not lit!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I mean, really, there isn't much I can say against \\"Mama,\\" because it has more strengths than it does weaknesses. The movie itself is really good, the plot is good, although at times a little difficult to follow, the children being feral adds to the chills and thrills of this movie, and the villain is delightfully scary. However, although the villain is scary, she isn't seen often, but when she does, you know she's gonna chill you to the bone :D
B00BPXKWKY|5.0|While Out Of Time and Automatic For The People have some real gems on them (ie Belong and Find The River) Green is the last album the band made that was solid all the way through, and the only album of their Warner Bros. years that stands up next to their first 6 albums.  After Green, they pretty much decided to make entire albums that were variations on Swan Swan H.  This vinyl reissue sound fantastic!  While not quite on par with MFSL's recent Life's Rich Pageant vinyl, Rhino's Green reissue really highlights the beauty of Mills & Berry playing, in rich, deep tones.
1781162646|5.0|How can I possibly review this without giving spoilers? I'll do my best.<br />Okay, so before I give my opinion, I'll explain sort of what this book is about: It's a coming-of-age story about a 21-year-old boy named Devin Jones who gets a job as a coney at an amusement park called Joyland. While working at Joyland, he lives with Mrs. Shoplaw, who has a beachside accommodation nearby the amusement park. As the story progresses, we meet a lot of nice people, and then we find out about one ride in Joyland that is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a girl whose boyfriend slit her throat in that ride, and killed her.<br />That is all I think I have to say about what the book is about, now it's my turn to say what I thought: First of all, I'm a huge fan of Stephen King's (aren't we all?), and I had high expectations from Joyland. I had preordered it back in January to ensure I got a copy as soon as it was out, because there was something about this story that drew me in. Anyways, the book starts off like most Stephen King books: he lays a lot of the background information out before he gets to the real story, and this book is no exception. Devin has job training at Joyland, which takes up a good 100 pages of the novel (not complaining, it is there to help continue the story). So anyways, the characters are actually loveable, which is rare in a book, and the story is short but sweet, which makes it really good (I didn't believe Stephen could write a shorter story!) Anyway, it's a coming-of-age story. It's a ghost story, but it's also got parts of love in it. It ends on what I fould a sad note, and it was the first time I remember crying over reading a book (that's all I want to say about that, because again I can't spoil anything). I have to say I agree with the CEO of Hard Case Crime when he said, \\"Even the most hard-boiled readers will find themselves moved.\\" It's an emotional book that was wonderfully written.<br />I kinda feel bad for Stephen King as well, reading theother reviews here. I have to say that I applaud King for denying an ebook publication. I have read many angry reviews from people who want to have an ebook of it, and people saying they'll refuse to buy it. However, it's a beautiful book, and it's unfortunate that people will let themselves miss out on this wonderful story.<br />PLUS, STEPHEN KING FANS: I HEARD THE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR THIS MOVIE TO BE TURNED INTO A MOVIE :D
B000000I42|5.0|It works like a charm. I've had no problems with it. Well worth the buy. Looking for more vinyl records.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|This action movie is one of my all time favorites.There is violence in the movie but it is well scrip[ted and appropriate. Very little foul language & no fortuitous sexual content. A classic movie!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|The music industry is often a mixed bag with one album sounding like another.  Daft Punk continues to surprise with smash hit that will get you pumped on the way to the club or even wake you up in the morning on the way to work.  A great mixture of sound and lyrics that will move you.  Worth every penny.<br /><br />It is nice to see a very creative band continue forward without the same old sounds.

0425252868|4.0|very interesting, compelling story.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  All the planning and prep work and raising funds must have been very frustrating for the team.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you love the books, you'll probably love the film which stays pretty close to the book. The scenery, costumes, story, etc. are beautifully done, although some license is taken to change some characters' ages, descriptions, etc.. e.g., Bran is 7 in the book, yet 9 in the same scenes in the film, and Rickon is much younger in the book; Dany has violet eyes, and her brother has lilac eyes, but not so in the film although contacts would have allowed it. The scenery in some areas isn't as described.<br /><br />So far I'm still on the first book of the series because it is so popular that the books are all on hold, and cannot be renewed due to more holds.... Finally I ordered my own set of books. Also the DVDs are popular at the library- and difficult to obtain in the chronological order, so I bought the complete 1st & 2nd seasons.<br /><br />Can hardly wait for the complete 3rd season to be released. I still intend to read the books because I love so many characters, and the story - although many people say that after the 3rd book the story loses its vitality, etc..
B007VUCAVO|5.0|One of the most useful apps I have encountered.  I feel it is an enhancement that is not intrusive and provides ready to use information.
0425263991|5.0|I honestly didn't think I would like this books as much as I did the others because it didn't involve any of the changelings and Kaleb wasn't a character I could connect with but I was pleasantly surprised. I can honestly say that this is probably one of my favorite books in the series so far. It was beautifully written and Kaleb is a beautifully flawed protagonist with such a complex and warped background it made this books HEA so much better for it. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would definitely recommend it to fans of this series.

0439023483|5.0|This book is a great and easy read with such a strong story line.  I wanted the hard cover to complete my set.
0143036424|4.0|While Johnson is not a John Sanford, Lee Child, John Grisham or Ken Follett, he is a very entertaining writer. I laughed out loud several times while reading the book. His humor is more subtle than Evanovich's and his use of old sayings is superb.<br /><br />I thinbk he over describes the countryside a bit and his Indian names are a bit unrealistic. Ellen Walks Over Ice and the like is like John Jumps The Moon. John Blue Fox or Hannah Red Tree I could live with..<br /><br />The mystery level is pretty good, though not as exciting as I'd like. Overall I think he's a pretty good writer who will only get better.<br /><br />Jerry Warren<br />Monroe, NC

0988178532|5.0|I won this book through Goodreads and I am so glad that I did. I loved Outview, it was fantastic! I was completely hooked on the book, and didn't want to put it down! The characters in the book were intriguing and interesting and I loved seeing Nate go through what he did to discover his abilities. Outview had a lot going on and kept going without getting boring. Loved it and can not wait to read the next one.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|good book, good story line......this is probably not something that hermann hesse would write, but this was a good book that took another view of telling the zombie war........let's see how the movie &#34;tells the book&#34;.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|he was such a sob.......but, what a mind that saw things, and made them happen in his life time. if he hadn't always been so successful in bending reality to make apple, he probably would still be around now......the one thing that he could not control was his illness.  every time i use one of my apple products, i now see some of what he talked about and demanded......this shows all warts, this is a must read.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I rented this movie and did not believe I would like it.<br />It stayed in our theater in town<br />so long I felt I had to see it. Despite the tepid reviews,<br />I liked it a lot. The scenery was magnificent.<br />It is still a child's story like a fairy tale<br />but it's very entertaining. Look at the reviews, you either<br />like or hate it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|good book. as far as i know, he tells you about war, you protect the people you are there with......i plan on reading this book again this summer.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This album is daring; indeed it's his most daring album to date. And it includes all the pomp and vanity that we've come to know and love of Mr. West. Don't try to compare it with his other, older albums. It's new music. It's different music. Keep an open mind and you'll enjoy what you hear. All that said, it's a great album filled with interesting lyrics and powerful themes.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|I was surprised at the movie, I am a great fan of the original Wizard of OZ, this movie is not a good if the like the original but lots of fun the watch, brings a new look to the story.

0425263908|5.0|I own this book, and this review is my personal opinion.<br /><br />I read \\"Bared To You\\" after the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" books, and I was honestly afraid that it was going to be very similar to them. So, because of this, I waited a long time before I even started reading it. I was so wrong, and I really wish I didn't wait so long to read it! They were nothing alike! The only similarity was the young and successful business men characters. The similarities end there though. Gideon and Christian are nothing alike!<br /><br />I absolutely love Eva! I fell in love with her instantly. She was so strong and beautiful. Just a wonderful character all around. I loved her and Gideon together. Gideon was absolutely delicious and I wanted to just lick him! (did I just say that?!?! hehe) Gideon and Eva's chemistry was undeniable and they steamed up the pages of this book! The sexual tension between them when they weren't intimate was so insane! It was amazing!<br /><br />I definitely recommend \\"Bared To You\\" to readers just looking for a good book! If you want good strong and in depth characters, a hot and steamy romance, with a great plot and storyline, then you will enjoy this book! I give it 5 out of 5 STARS! I am a fan of Sylvia Day and will continue reading her books, that's for sure.<br /><br />I cannot wait to dive into Reflected Into You, followed by Entwined With You!<br /><br />Happy Reading!<br /><br />Brianna Lee Book Reviews
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Michael Connolly's Lincoln lawyer switches to the prosecution for a chance to work with his ex-wife and get her a better position in the DA's office.  Mirroring the work he usually does as a defense attorney, he realizes how heavy &#34;the burden of proof&#34; is for the prosecution.  Working with Harry Bosch as the investigator. he thrusts and parries with the defense attorney.  Just when it appears he has won the trial, a new intervention comes up.  Solid mystery-solving, three dimensional characters, a suspense that builds to the very end, and a sympathetic protagonist gives this book 5 stars.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie is awesome. I had my doubts about this film and boy it took me for a loop. I thought that they did a great job. I will always love the original superman movies. but I think this reboot is going to be great zack Snyder did the original movies justice and did mr. Christopher revves justice as well. I loved the actor who played superman he was really good he got the character down very well. we all know that we can not replace Christopher reeves as superman but he comes pretty close. I thought he was better than Brandon Roth. this movie had so many intense fight scenes espicialy the ones between general zod and superman. I was glad they put a different villain besides lex luthor in the movie. I thought Michael Shannon did a great job as general zod. and I loved what they did with krypton they made it an actual planet with plants and animals it was very imaginative. this series is going to be great. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. I hope it leads into the justice league movie.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|Must have for any Foo Fighters fans.  Close up insight to Dave and the boys.  Showing his lovely down to earth, real ness and makes you love him and the Foos even more.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|Born Sinner marks the return from one of the leaders of the new school in Hip Hop, J. Cole. His debut album Cole World: The Sideline Story was a solid album, however I felt fell very short to the standards his fans and hip hop lovers have been hyping him up to be, especially with the standards he set up for himself with his critically praised mixtapes The Warm Up and Friday Night Lights. 2 years later, J. Cole has come back with a vengeance more inspired and more confident than ever before. The album starts off incredibly strong with the opening track &#34;Villuminati&#34;, first showing how much he has progressed as a producer. The strings and Biggie sample makes this track one of my personal favorites.  The next track is a skit that transitions to the next song &#34;LAnd of Snakes&#34; that samples OutKast's most celebrated song (Da Art of Storytelling Pt.1) adding more percussions and beautiful female vocals in the background. This song has J. Cole venting about his rise to success and newfound fame. The first single &#34;Power Trip&#34; has J. Cole fantasizing about a girl he has been pursuing hoping he can finally get with her, a catchy song featuring a short but great contribution from R&B sensation Miguel.<br /><br />This album features 12 full songs with 2 skits and 2 interludes that act as 2 short songs. The first interlude being &#34;Mo Money Interlude&#34; which is not all that memorable, but the lyrics get the job done and the second being &#34;Aint That Some S***&#34; with Cole being cocky and confident. &#34;Trouble&#34; features a haunting choir singing trouble in the background. The lyrics encompass Cole's thoughts about the trials and tribulations that he experiences in life with women. &#34;Runaway&#34; follows the same themes about girl problems but in the perspective of other women, and in my opinion contains one of the stronger messages on the album that I'm sure a lot of people can relate to.  &#34;Rich Ni**az&#34; is a simplistic track about materialism but features J. Cole's rapping with more tenacity flowing faster than any other song on the album. &#34;Chaining Day&#34; has a very smooth soul sample riding throughout the song with Cole talking about his rise to success once again. &#34;Crooked Smile&#34; featuring the legendary TLC is my personal favorite song on the album. J. Cole raps about his physical insecurities and how imperfections make people better human beings. &#34;Born Sinner&#34; wraps up the album rather well with a theme of hope and nice vocals from James Fauntleroy on the hook accompanied with great instrumentals great lyrics from J. Cole.<br /><br />No matter how much I like this album, there are still a couple of songs that don't connect with me. &#34;She Knows&#34; was a hit or miss for me personally; I appreciate Cole experimenting a bit more using more eclectic samples, and I do like the production on this song as well, but the lyrics were insipid and the hook &#34;I'll be up so high, tryna get a piece of that apple pie&#34; made me cringe ... The song &#34;Forbidden Fruit&#34; was one of my most anticipated songs for the album and I was extremely disappointed with the end product. J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar together on one song should've been incredible, but instead we basically have a boring re-hash of A Tribe Called Quests &#34;Electric Relaxation&#34;. I feel like J. Cole added this song at the last minute just to grab the attention of Kendrick Lamar fans, and mainly because he added a line about releasing his album the same day as Kanye West which was only to Cole's knowledge less than 2 months ago...Kendrick Lamar was criminally underused and he even sounds bored on the song. &#34;Let Nas Down&#34; is an interesting track about Cole's experience from Nas's negative response to his radio song &#34;Work Out&#34; from his debut album and also serves as a tribute to his Hip Hop Heroes; personally I thought the idea of the track came off a little too corny for an album like this...J. Cole made himself sound like a whiny brat instead of vulnerable like this album was suppose to entail. I understand the sentiment of the song, but this song should've been a bonus track because it did not mesh well with the concept of the album.<br /><br />I must admit as well that the album has a very loose concept. I understand that J. Cole was trying to bring the dichotomy of his life to fruition within the album and trying to tie up the songs in a way where the concept would become clear to the listeners, but he didn't execute it the way I imagined. With that being said, Born Sinner is still a great album with a lot of great songs on it, and J. Cole is still a great lyricist and story teller. Support good Hip Hop and buy this album.<br /><br />Favorite 5<br />1) Villuminati<br />2) Rich Ni**az<br />3) LAnd of the Snakes<br />4) Trouble<br />5) Crooked Smile feat.

B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Kanye West is one of the most prolific Hip Hop artists to have ever existed. Each one of his solo efforts from The College Dropout - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy changed the hip hop climate, challenging himself to create cohesive albums that demand to be heard from beginning to end. Fans of Kanye already know that each one of Kanye's album had a distinct sound from College Dropout's soul sampling to 808s & Heartbreak minimal 808 drums and melodic singing, and even Graduation's synthesized instrumentals every one of Kanye's projects changed the boundaries of what Hip Hop could, should and would be. 2013, we have a new Kanye West album 3 years after the impeccable release of arguably Kanye's best album to date \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\". MBDTF was a musical tour de force, featuring maniacal instrumentals combining classical orchestration with hard rugged beats and unconventional samples of songs spanning multiple genres. It would be an incredible challenge for Kanye to succeed in creating an album that could at least match the ambition of MBDTF, as far as Hip Hop fans are concerned, his past 2 releases Watch The Throne with mentor Jay-Z and Cruel Summer with his label G.O.O.D. Music failed to live up to the levels of MBDTF. Now we have Kanye's 6th studio album \\"YEEZUS\\" and I'm sure music fans are curious to how this album will live up to Kanye's past classic discography. The title itself is enough to cause controversy, but just like the \\"no artwork\\" cover implies, the music should speak for itself.<br /><br />1. On Sight - Yeezus starts off with a banger of a song with the assistance of Daft Punk. The beat reminds me of Daft Punk during their \\"Homework\\" era, with their signature titillating synthesizers. Kanye goes on in familiar territory when rapping about himself. The beat will would do wonders in a club and it serves as a nice short intro to the album that sets the tone for the album. 8/10<br /><br />2. Black Skinhead - Premiering on Saturday Night Live a month ago, the sentiment of this song can match any punk rock song from the 90's. The lyrics are towards racism and the political standings of African Americans, but Kanye brings attention towards his place in society as a scrutinized black man. French house duo, Daft Punk, helped with the productions and I must say that the Marilyn Manson sample mixed with the loud, in your face tribal drums is an experience all in its own. The tone in Kanye's voice is angry and his screaming is infectious. 10/10<br /><br />3. I Am a God -  I wasn't a big fan of this song on first listen. The title of the song alone made me a bit skeptical to actually liking the record, but multiple listens later it grew on me. The song will be criticized as blasphemous and I believe that this record is the epitome of Kanye's ego, but I take the song in a different context. He never actually says he is God himself, he still humanizes himself to an extent by recognizing Jesus and the real God is above him. I personally believe that Kanye is representing himself as a Hip Hop God in this song, and it's hard to argue. This isn't any different than Jay-Z calling himself HOVA. It is hard to defend Kanye with him creating a song like this, especially with the elementary, uninspired, narcissistic lyrics.. but the musicality isn't half bad with more primal screaming from Ye. 7/10<br /><br />4. New Slaves (feat. Frank Ocean) - The first song released to the public since the album was announced through an ingenious marketing scheme involving public projections all across the world in various locations. This song features simple production, but the aggression of Kanye's ideals towards the industry is a breath of fresh air from his recent music. Although he takes the liberty to drop a couple of egotistic lines \\"see theres leaders and there's followers, but I'd rather be a d*** than a swallower\\" (it wouldn't be Kanye without it), he does however take the opportunity to rap about the government, racial andsocial classes and even his own position as a rap superstar. The Frank Ocean vocals at the end are nice and soulful which is really the polar opposite of the main song. 10/10<br /><br />5. Hold My Liquor (feat. Chief Keef & Justin Vernon) - This track has an interesting feel to it. The instrumentals have distorted and drowning effects which I'm sure is an intentional choice for the liquor metaphor this song is trying to incite. The story revolves around Kanye drinking his sorrows away and engaging in drunken activities. It's a cool track, nothing out of this world. Chief Keef's feature actually fit into the song and he didn't sound as bad as I imagined it to be. 7/10<br /><br />6. I'm In It (feat. Agent Sasco & Justin Vernon)- Braggadocios rap. Kanye using punchlines to describe sexuality. This song really reminded me of what Lil Wayne is doing right now which is not a good thing. I was entertained by some of the clever lines, but I found this song to be rather dry substantially. 7/10<br /><br />7. Blood on the Leaves - Reminiscent of his 808 & Heartbreak days. The \\"Strange Fruit\\" sample rendition of Nina Simone adds a disturbing ambiance to the song. The title of the track misdirected my attention into believing that this song would be about slavery. But instead Kanye takes a different direction and changes it into a song about women and his celebrity. I was highly disappointed with the direction he took this track. But musically this song is one of the most impressive on the album. 8/10<br /><br />8. Guilt Trip (feat. Kid Cudi) - One of my personal favorites on the album. Kanye and Kid Cudi collaborating on tracks together always comes out magical and this song is no different. I love the instrumental, despite the unorthodox use of samplings and weird undertone of the record. Kanye's singing once again, but this time in a weird filtered auto-tune. Theres nothing spectacular about the song lyrically, but production wise I love the record. 9/10<br /><br />9. Send It Up (feat. King L) - This is my least favorite track. Unnecessary and repetitive beat as well as a useless feature from Chicago's King L. This was just a boring mess of a song that really didn't go anywhere. Easily one of the worst songs Kanye has ever put on a album. 3/10<br /><br />10. Bound 2 (feat. Charlie Wilson) - recovering from the previous song, the album finishes off decently with the Bound 2. A song that really brings me back to the old Kanye with a sped up soulful samples. Kanye even sounds humorous again, which is a nice break from all the seriousness the album is forced upon the listeners. I liked the song, but ending the album with this song was just a head-scratcher for me. I really thought it would've been more appropriate to end the song with \\"I Am A God\\". Still I love the song and story which I'm sure was written for his Baby Mama Kim Kardashian. 9/10<br /><br />I'm sure all the backpacker rap fanatics will hate this album. And even some Kanye West fans would hate this album. But as for me, I always enjoy Kanye venturing into new territory he hasn't been before. Yeezus was really the most eclectic and most confusing piece of work Kanye has ever created, and I am honestly not sure if I can fully support this route that Kanye is taking with his music. But as a Kanye fan, I liked Yeezus for the most part. I just hope his next project would have a little more focus and better written songs.social classes and even his own position as a rap superstar.

B003Y5D776|4.0|Greetings. Please clear up some confusion.<br />I am trying to purchase an iMic from Amazon but there are so many different prices and models.<br />What is the difference between<br />Item model number: GC16031<br />Item model number: 7725-IUAI<br />Item model number: GC16035<br /><br />Are they all the same or are there different types of iMics?<br /><br />Thanks
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I went to see Benedict Cumberbatch (I'm a Cumber-Collective) He is REALLY good in this with a lot of emotion and created himself a real complicated villian. Turns out, and I am not a trekie by any means, I ended up enjoying the action scenes and the the relationship of the main characters. This movie went really fast and was a lot of fun to watch.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Scenes between the mini-games are little long but over-all a good game. Keeps both me and my kids occupied. Story line is ok if a little cheesy, but we don't play for the story. Fun game.
B0071AKB38|2.0|I have been seeing so many mixed reviews for different products that I decided to buy a few, try them out, and decide for myself which one I'm going to keep.  So I ended up buying the 4 speakers that have high ratings:<br />Accessorise (tm) Portable Bluetooth Wireless Mini Speaker System,<br />Alpatronix AX300 X-tra Strong Bluetooth Portable Mini Capsule Speaker,<br />DBEST London Duo Bluetooth Rechargeable Mini-Speaker Set (PS4003BT-RB),<br />HMDX Audio HX-P230GY JAM Classic Bluetooth Wireless Speaker,<br />and X-Mini KAI XAM11-B Bluetooth Capsule Speaker.<br /><br />Having tested them, I thought I would post my review here in the hopes that it would clear out doubts for others.  Here are the results of my testing.  In each category, I have ranked them 1-5, with 1 being my favorite, and 5 being the least favorite:<br /><br />Design:<br />#1: I have to say Alpatronix speakers claim the spot hands down!  Right out of the box, my son was about to steal it from me.  He ended up doing so anyway, but I managed to keep him away from it until I finished testing the speaker.  The speaker is sleek with rubberized finish and a chrome sleeve on the top and the sides.  It's also the most portable onewithout compromising sound quality.  The packaging is also very classy (for gifting), and is fun just to open.  Kinda like apple products!  It looks very sophisticated indeed.<br />#2 spot goes to HMDX JAM.  I have to say I wasn't that crazy about the shape of the actual speaker which is just a cylinder, but the box is like a jam jar, which I thought was cool for children.  The speaker is much bigger than the other ones and doesn't fit comfortably in the pocket of my jeans.  It's also VERY heavy considering the size, so you'll feel it in your pocket if you are finally able to fit it in.<br />#3 spot goes to DBEST.  It looks like the Alpatronix without the chrome, and also looks like X-Mini KAI.  It's not very portable because it has 2 speakers so I can't fit it into my pocket.  Even my wife who normally carries a big purse wants to have the smallest possible option, which is definitely not this one.<br />#4 spot goes to X-Mini KAI.  Again, it looks and functions like the Alpatronix, but without the chrome band.  Other than that, it looks like a black blob...  nothing special.  The packaging doesn't look bad.  Hard plastic packaging dressed with thin cardboard dressing.<br />#5 spot goes to Accessories.  This looked really cool in pictures but actually the plastic looks cheap.  Size is very small, similar to Alpatronix, and KAI but doesn't expand.  The packaging is thin flexible plastic and looks cheapish.  I don't recommend it for a gift.<br /><br />Sound:<br />I tested the speakers with different types of music:  Pop, rock, hiphop, house, and classical.  Also I charged all the speakers fully before testing.<br />#1: HMDX JAM.  The sound is louder in this speaker.  This must be due to the bigger size, which means a bigger and wider speaker in the device.  However, I didn't like the bass level relative to the volume level, and the weight and size are a big negative.<br />#2: Alpatronix.  In expanded form, it has a very nice sound and covers both high and low ends really well, with a very nicely developed sound.  When I first played it, I thought it was weak until I read the user manual which indicated the speaker turns on at mid volume and that you can increase it to full volume with the little knob that controls most of the functions.  Can't believe this little thing makes such big sound!<br />#3: DBEST.  The sound on this speaker is ok.  Considering there's 2 speakers, I just expected more!  Considering the negatives mentioned in the design, I didn't bother testing it for too long as I was sadly disappointed with the first couple songs I played.<br />#4: X-Mini KAI.  This one just sounds weak.  Being about the size and shape of the Alpatronix and DBEST, I was expecting it to perform about the same, but the sound is just really weak even at full volume.  It has a nicely developed sound but it just doesn't get loud.<br />#5: Accessories.  The sound is as loud as the HMDX JAM.  But the positives stop here.  It just covers the highs, and nothing of the lows.  No bass at all, and screeching at full blast!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />#1:  Alpatronix AX300 was the most well-rounded speaker, meeting everything the manufacturer claims.  It's portable, VERY nice sound, great packaging, and good price!<br />#2:  HMDX JAM has good sound, but not very portable.  Don't like the shape, weight, or size.  The packaging looks cool if you are into jam jars, but I purchased it for portability and sound.  It met the sound qualification, but definitely not the other criteria.<br />#3:  DBEST.  Like #2, but the sound is not as good.  That's why this one receives #3.<br />#4:  X-Mini KAI.  I would avoid it if possible.  Weak sound, but nice portability.<br />#5:  Accessories.  I would not spend money on this.  Bad sound, cheap look, and cheap packaging.  Like a singer who sings beyond their voice range.  No bass at all and screaming!<br /><br />Good luck with your purchase!  I have to go get me another Alpatronix AX300 now that my son has the first one :)ll volume.  It has a nicely developed sound but it just doesn't get loud.<br />#5: Accessories.  The sound is as loud as the HMDX JAM.  But the positives stop here.  It just covers the highs, and nothing of the lows.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I rated this a three. Because it seemed a little slow at getting to the story.  It did have a nice twist at the end.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Like most viewers of Downton Abbey I've been addicted to the series from the first episode of the first season.  The excellent cast, fine writing, and the wonderful sets and costumes make it a \\"Don't Miss\\" for me.  In Season 3 the noble Crawley family and their servants at Downton Abbey, having survived the vissitudes of World War I more or less intact, are faced with new economic and social pressures.  The world is changing, and the path is no longer automatically smoothed for bearers of noble titles and distinguished lineages.<br /><br />The Earl of Grantham gets things off to a rough start by mismanaging his wife Cora's wealth so badly that he loses it all and faces having to sell Downton Abbey.  His cousin, heir, and new son-in-law Matthew Crawley manages to sort things out in the end, but it's only the beginning. The Earl's daughters Mary (now married to Matthew at last), Edith, and Sybil all continue to have romantic ups and downs, while the Dowager Countess finds her place as Queen of Downton challenged by the arrival of Martha Levinson, the American mother of Lady Grantham. Below stairs the staff continues to soldier on, beset by scandal and romantic turmoils of their own. Eventually tragedy strikes both below and above stairs, leaving plenty of loose ends and questions that will lead to a Season 4 (and who knows how many more?)<br /><br />The fine cast headlined by Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, Michelle Dockery, Penelope Wilton, and Jim Carter among many others has some stellar additions, most notably Shirley MacLaine.  Downton Abbey is over the top, sometimes campy, and with more plot twists and turns than any five or six other soap operas, but it's always sheer escapist fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is minecraft but it doesn't have all the blocks in real minecraft<br />but it's  still very very great game
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|This album is truly amazing. He did it again. As if the first album wasn't good enough' Born Sinner is great.  You can definitely seen progression and growth from previous work he has done.  I would recommend this to anyone who does in fact enjoy good music, especially rap. Good job J. Cole
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like this game a lot, but it is frustrating how long it takes to complete a level. I wish you didn't need to use real money for pearls. Great graphics!
B00BNPWBOO|5.0|I'm one of the very few individuals on this planet, I suppose, that finds Primal Scream's 1994 effort Give Out But Don't Give Up a fairly enjoyable effort. Go listen again! You'll see! Yes, the neon Confedate flag on the cover was a little much (not to mention overtly obvious), and three of the twelve songs are downright unlistenable, but I dare anyone with more than one musical taste bud to deny the funky power of the title cut, or the Euro-boogie of opening track Jailbird. It was no Screamadelica, and I was disappointed, but now that almost 20 years and five albums have passed I now see GOBDGU as a pretty good effort from The `Scream. Or, perhaps, it's because the `Scream have released what I consider (and I'm a fan!) one of the most unintentionally hysterically funny and quite turgid `homage' albums in the history of recorded music with the bilious Riot City Blues. Woeful is a word that comes to mind. Ick!<br /><br />PS retreated after being crucified by not only the critics but also, and more importantly, by their fans, and came up with the dub-tastic Vanishing Point, the dark cousin to Screamadelica. In 2000 came XTRMNTR, an amazing album full of angst and electronics, and some of the best songs Primal Scream have ever written. Screamadelica remained my favorite, but this has rose fairly quickly and has been my #2 ever since. Evil Heat is underrated, paling (slightly) in comparison to the amazing XTRMNTR. As Pitchfork summed up: \\"so despite XTRMNTR's moments of glory, I filed it away and crossed my fingers awaiting its follow-up. After all, Primal Scream may be known for a lot of things, but consistency of style is not one of them.\\" Right.<br /><br />Then came the crap flood with the odorous Riot City Blues in 2006. The less said about this steaming, vomitous pile the better. It's interesting to note that usually quite reasonable allmusic gave it a 7 out of 10, and stated that it \\"is a much more relaxed effort, and benefits significantly from that stance.\\" Thealbum sucks. Take my word for it.<br /><br />2 years later and Primal Scream release Beautiful Future, which is marginally better than Riot City Blues. It is competent, holding pattern Primal Scream; no more, no less.<br /><br />I tell you all this to illustrate that even after all this time, and all these ups and downs (severe downs) you'd think I'd be done. The weird thing is, though, I find myself still getting excited over a new Primal Scream album, and this one in particular. It's not rational, I know, but I do. And you know what? This is more than merely 'good'. In my opinion it's not quite as good as Screamadelica but better than XTRMNTR. It's got it all, an encapsulation of everything good they've done up to this point: loved up dance grooves, 13th Floor Elevators style psychedelia, Stooges guitar crunch, spacey electronics...the one thing that surprised me on this recording that I didn't expect was the downright funky bass!<br /><br />All this would be window dressing if the songs weren't good. Not to worry, 'cause they are. Top shelf Scream, brothers and sisters, top shelf.
0553328255|5.0|We always wanted to read the full series of &#34;the originals&#34;, and you just can't beat the price of this set. The first book is a little big (think the size of a standard bible), but the second one is easier to carry around with you on your trips.<br />The stories? Oh, it's Sherlock, of course they are good!
B000LB7G00|5.0|-first time I've used one of these.  It's fantastic.  Can't go back.  Bought one for a colleague.  Merry Christmas in June!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I normally don't write reviews but this game is as good as Angry Birds. Very entertaining and just the right challenge! You won't be dissapointed.
B0009HKH6Q|3.0|We love Steve McQueen & Faye Dunaway, but this movie is a bit dated. The 1999 version is far better. Our thoughts are that Crowne in the 1999 version seems more plausible and it's about a &#34;game&#34; as opposed to a somewhat hard to swallow heist. The 1968 heist is simply not plausible in the post 2000 technology world and that is somewhat of a detractor - just as the 1999 version will likely be just as unlikely in another decade or so. However, it's fun to watch both and compare.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Not the best of the Daniel Craig Bond movies.  I was just replacing a stolen copy.  Couldn't beat the price.
0425166805|5.0|This book was extremely entertaning and just left me wanting more answers and asking more questions! recommend it 100% Awesome!
B0000028P8|4.0|I purchased this to replace a cassette tape. Trying to convert my cassettes over to CDs. Her early music is great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. It is easy to loose track of time playing it though. It is a great game for all ages.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|A lot of in app purchases are available so parents monitor your your kids spending! As a new casual gamer I found the directions vague and geared to those familiar with the platform. I felt it was difficult to get momentum without a few app purchases. The graphics are charming and you do have a lot of choices of what kind of game play adventure you want. Fun once you have built up a foundation.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I got this game thinking it was going to suck like most of the fps games on here..... I was never so wrong. It is so fun with all the different classes and guns I played it for a long  time without taking a break. The only down side is that it requires real money for some teams and weapons.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|A very good war game.I play it more that my other war game ..! Thanks Gameloft keep up the good work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good read about the effects of violence on younger adults. Much more than a book for young adults. Run and read it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very challenging, you have to think hard for some of the puzzles. hope more levels are released soon. I liked this game.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The pc version has more maps and modes like coop the android version needs to be like that it also needs to get more updates for the game. It is an awesome game it just needs way more stuff
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|The Audio CD is good , excellent group of sons very detail on the music and interpreter, I recommend this CD to people that Love good music
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|HANSON does it again!  As a long-time fan, it's no surprise that ANTHEM is another fantastic artistic endeavor.  Every album HANSON creates serves as a reminder that this band is serious about quality musicianship, and that's why I'm so thankful to have them in the music world.  Their talent and hard work is a blessing for sure. What's fun, too, is that the guys always offer a lot of sneak peeks into their albums prior to release, but nothing compares to how exciting the new music is once we hear it in its entirety.  I would highly recommend purchasing ANTHEM.  It's got something for everyone and very well done!!!
B00BNPUA5Q|1.0|Okay - for the first time ever with the Go Dev Team, I have to say that I am getting ripped off here by somebody & customer service is pathetic.  I paid freaking $16 for this app about a month ago & I noticed it was version 1.28 & the Play Store had version 1.37, but I figured it was not a huge deal.  Well - all kinds of things were wrong, including widgets not updating, not being able to add more screens & other misc issues.  I emailed the Go Dev Team, at which point they responded that I MUST either buy it from the Google Play Store or the Go website through Paypal & that the app I just paid $16 for was pirated!  I could not even believe the email.  To not only accuse me of fraud & piracy, but also to say I have to go spend another $16 and lose all the customization that I had just spent hours working on!  Needless to say - I am beyond hot right now.  This not a $0.99 app that I can just brush this stuff off.  This is the most expensive app that I have ever bought & now I have been ripped off by Amazon or the Go Dev Team or BOTH!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS APP from the Amazon App Store.  Why it is still here, I have no idea.  And the Go Dev Team should be ashamed for not standing behind their most expensive product, as I know they got some money off this.  This has been a pathetic waste of my precious time & money.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun...hours and hours worth. Many different designs to choose from. You can choose to play for your own fun or against others on line. Very glad I bought it.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|Cloud Atlas was hard to follow, I saw the movie once and bought the dvd so I can see it again and again to figure more of it out.  Many hidden secrets I suspect.  Amazing stories of growth of the soul over centuries or is it all happening at once?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't put it down. The story is amazing, lacking nothing to keep b you reading. Must read next book of now!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was so touching and it really makes you think. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a sweet and lovable book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game so I think this is a game for kids and grown ups to get if they like a big challenge not if they don't because it is frustrating and they could get a head ache.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I don't think the movie was a excedllent as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but it was good. I was more impressed with disk 2 that contained all the background information.  When we watch a particular movie, it never enters our minds what goes into the details of production.  This was a &#34;blow-by-blow&#34; walk through the process.  Without it, would anyone ever know that The Shire is now a real place in New Zealand? The only other DVD that I have in my collection that provides such in-depth background is AVATAR's  three disk set.

B00C061I3K|5.0|I pre-ordered Daft Punk's new album (yes, new!!!... and album?) &#34;Random Access Memories&#34; from Amazon and received it Tuesday. It is, for lack of any other word to adequately describe it, perfect.<br /><br />After ordering the Tron Soundtrack (by Daft Punk, that's why it's relevant) I was a bit skeptical; not that it was bad, but it didn't have the effect that older music by them does.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's predictable, because every now and then they sound like they're going crazy, much like the end of that old Offspring album from the late 90s that makes you wonder what just died... but then they bring it back to the sounds that you think of when you think Daft Punk.<br /><br />If you think you don't know Daft Punk or haven't heard of them, I think you would be shocked. They are one of those bands that shows up everywhere. Most recently, their song Harder, Faster, Better, Stronger was sampled in Kanye West's song Harder.<br /><br />They have a sound unique to them, but it's easy to hear elements of their style in many of the genres of today. I would expect that if you were to group U2, Tool, and Radiohead together in terms of influence or inspiration on other artists, Daft Punk would be there as well, although possibly a bit more invisible.<br /><br />I highly recommend you check it out, even if (or maybe especially if) this is branching out of your normal comfort zone.<br /><br />Note that the CD version on Amazon includes the new AudioRip feature, which will allow you to listen to the mp3s using the Amazon Cloud Player as well as download them to your devices. And, it's cheaper than buying the mp3 version! I'm guessing they are trying to boost the adoption.

She tells everything, she's so descriptive in her troubles and such that makes you almost feel as if you're there. However, she didn't go into the recovery as much as I had hoped. I would buy another one of her book sin heartbeat if it ever happens!
B00BPA6XUK|3.0|If you like soundtracks, you might like this. I heard M83 perform on Jimmy Kimmel (I think) so I bought this immediately. I was somewhat disappointed because the song I heard was track 17, and the rest were instrumental.<br /><br />I can respect the talent in the music; instead of annoyingly pushing the limits as TSO does, this group maintains ties to traditional orchestra but updates it a bit more subtly, and singling out an instrument in the background should impress you.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars though because it's not at all what I expected. It somewhat feels like the first 16 tracks lead up to track 17, however, it's a bit of abrupt transition, and I wasn't really looking forward to 16 instrumental songs to be followed by 1 lyrical.<br /><br />I think most people will either love the first 16, or love the last track, and agree that there is a build-up but the transition or climax is just a bit clunky.<br /><br />And, I didn't know that his was from a Tom Cruise movie. Eccentric I know, but had I known that I would not have ordered this.

0385491026|4.0|\\"And yet it disturbs me to know I have hurt someone unintentionally. I want all my hurts to be intentional.\\"<br /><br />A short quote, but biting, full of scorn and honesty. After re-reading it a few times, working the words over in my head, I came to a realization. I realized what this means.<br /><br />This is what girlhood is.<br /><br />And, really, underneath all of the middle-age self-misery and careless, wistful affairs with older art professors, \\"Cat's Eye\\" is all about how a woman's girlhood shapes the way she lives the rest of her life. The pain we feel follows us into adulthood, and the wounds we inflict leave their mark as well. We never want to cause those real wounds, but by God, we all did.<br /><br />Elaine Risley, a controversial painter, has returned to Toronto to attend a retrospective devoted to her work. While back in the city, Elaine reflects on her relationships and friendships she had as a child and teenager, especially the one she had with a girl named Cordelia, whose influence followed Elaine for her entire life.<br /><br />We see Elaine make a bold transition from a tomboyish little girl who traveled with her family all over Canada for her father's science career to a clueless school-aged girl who is thrust suddenly into the world of other school-aged girls. Girl culture is a prominent theme in this novel, the culture of fashion scrapbooks and makeup and stealing things from drugstores, of dating etiquette and relationships with brothers, of knowing your place in the hierarchy of female friendship. Atwood knows, as all women do, that the cruelest people on this plant are young girls. If you have ever been a female between the ages of 9 and 18, you have survived hell. This is also a novel that touches on human consumerism, a theme popular in many of Atwood's environmental/sci-fi novels--Elaine realizes that she needs things; she needs purses and nightgowns and makeup. In the crux of her relationship with these three cruel girls--Grace, Carol, and the worst perpetrator, Cordelia--Elaine starts consuming herself, chewing on her hair, biting the skin around her nails and the hard flesh on the bottoms of her feet. Elaine stays with these girls because as we all know, a childhood spent with awful friends is better than a childhood spent alone, especially for girls. There is a part of the novel where after the girls pick on Elaine, Elaine takes all of her hard-earned babysitting money, quits her babysitting job, and spends all the earnings on candy, which she gives to the girls. They consume it, and in a way, Elaine feels consumed, and she mistakes this for love. Girlhood literally eats away at a child until she is nothing but the product of her environment.<br /><br />Elaine hardens to this girl culture, becomes a sharpened and bored high-school girl with a \\"mean mouth,\\" not impervious to this culture of catty women but simply afraid of it. The most emotional parts of the novel are when Elaine recalls events with her older brother Stephen, when times were simpler and she could focus on the hands-on activities and tasks she liked without having to worry about what she looked like from behind or how she spoke. Elaine doesn't really trust women but she doesn't really trust men either--the hurts inflicted on her from those girls when they were kids destroyed her ability to trust anyone.<br /><br />This book is the \\"cat's eye\\" of Elaine's life, the entire scope of her experience, and it is an interesting read with rich detail, full of Atwood's sharp eye for the realities of being a girl. That is part of the problem, though--these characters are just like you and me, too similar, until you wait and wait for a climax and nothing ever really happens. This just isn't a very exciting book, which is disappointing, because many of Atwood's novels have left me completely breathless. I understand her growth and change as a writer--I am much more fond of her later novels than her earlier ones. Even though this was an ambitious, well-written work of a fiction, I guarantee I will forget almost everything about it within a month, because it was a hyper-realistic account of a person's experience--it wasn't really a story. I also know that some people really love this. I totally get it. It just wasn't what I was expecting.<br /><br />I'd still recommend it, though, and I think it might be interesting to read as a teenager and then again as an adult. I wonder if I will read this again someday and see if any of those girlhood wounds have healed.
B005ZOCF5E|1.0|I just couldn't relate to the main characters at all.  Sunday and Geoffrey are two people you would dread hanging out with.  They seem like the certain types of friends we all have, or had that are so critical of everyone that you wonder what they are saying about you behind your back.  I found myself annoyed with them for the entire book.<br />  Then there is the long winded technical jargon witch in itself isn't so bad but when it's in conversational form between characters it becomes clear that its just filler,,,long, drawn out, boring filler,,,,that Alastair Reynolds uses when it suits him but will abandon just as quickly when he himself tires of it.  For example; he can explain in excruciating detail the inner workings and fail safes of an elevator for days, but when it's time to move on all you have to do to make the elevator fail is to hit all the buttons at once!<br />  I can't believe I made it through this entire book! But rest assured, it is the LAST by AR that I will ever read!

I am a fan of Hans Zimmer, and he has NOT disappointed!

B0081L391C|2.0|I did not like that it did not play all the way and that it had a  few funny moments not what like in comedy if it going to be funny it should not questionable. I like to have this one off the suggestion list. It a waste of money and it does not need to be promoted like that. Well at least not in the category that it is in. No doubt that actors are amazing but they fell short on this one, I believe that the director could have tried a little harder on this film. I have to say that it not funny like it was painted to be.

To each is own, all I know is that this album will impact music as an entity itself.<br /><br />Lastly if you are upset at him calling himself a god and not God then you should have quit buying his music so very long ago or stop being so sensitive and listen to the underlying messages in his songs. If you like myself praise only one God this album should amuse you not piss you off.

B004SRPXWQ|4.0|My daughter bought this on the kindle. All though she loves it, it drives me nuts but your kids will have fun lol
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is a very entertaining, addicting  game that is cute, fun for kids and all other ages alike, and poses a challenge instead of being boring like most games. My only complaint is that on the Drag'n Dash feature, it does this weird thing where it runs out of platforms and you can't go any farther. It's hard to explain. But, it is something that you should definitely get, and if you are wondering whether you should get it or not because it costs something, it is worth the 99 cents. I encourage you to get it, unless you cannot afford .99,  then you should keep it in mind for later.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good, fun game that is unlike most, and although it looks like it is for youngsters, it is actually fine for all ages.<br /><br />Have fun playing it!
075640407X|5.0|I bought this for myself first, then for my mother once I had fallen in love with it.<br />It is a slow-starting story, but it builds into something rather substantial.<br />I enjoy the character development, and the premises involved are rather fantastical and romantic.<br />If you enjoy fantasy, you should check this out.<br />My mother loves the book, and anticipates a third installation, despite only recently finishing the Wise Man's Fear.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good reading while travelling. Enjoyed the mystery and the location. Did not want to put down as it was quite suspenseful..
0756404738|5.0|I bought this along with the first for my mother on Mother's Day, and we both thoroughly enjoy the series.  This installation is much faster in action than the first, with even more frequent harrowing experiences.<br />I highly recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is the first I've read of Landay's work and I found it to be compelling, thought provoking, and well written. As the author noted several times, the circumstances may affect a mother differently, and as a mother I agree. I found the story Hitchcock-like, leaving the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps and create suspense.<br /><br />I've already ordered Landay's first novel and look forward to that and his future writings.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|What more can I say about a book that has been so written about? Or made into a major movie? The now-famous story of Billy<br /><br />Pilgrim, the boy/man/baby that becomes &#34;unstuck in time&#34;. He constantly revisits different moments in his life (including his death),<br /><br />seemingly at random. A great anti-war book, gently told by Kurt Vonnegut.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun little game!  It isn't a piece of cake, but about the point you start to get frustrated, you can figure out what to do. Very satisfying.
B00C2U6EUG|1.0|Before I begin this review of Man of Steel, let me make one or two things perfectly clear. I do not hate Hans Zimmer, or his music. I've met him on a couple of occasions, and he's an extremely nice and friendly man. As a composer, I think he's very talented. He was a genuinely groundbreaking artist when he first emerged on the scene in the late 1980s, and broke the film music mould when he wrote scores like Black Rain, Backdraft and Crimson Tide. I absolutely adore many of his works, ranging from A League of Their Own to The Prince of Egypt, The Last Samurai and Pearl Harbor. I think Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a masterpiece, and close to being the best score of his entire career. I have a few issues with the way his Remote Control organization has come to dominate the mainstream Hollywood film scoring world, but I admire him as a shrewd businessman, and he did help launch the careers of John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams among others, which is praise-worthy in itself. Having said that, I think Man of Steel is a colossal failure of both musical ingenuity and conceptual approach.<br /><br />After the success of The Dark Knight trilogy, rebooting Superman was almost an inevitability, as was the involvement of director/producer Christopher Nolan and writer David Goyer. In Man of Steel, director Zach Snyder gives us a Superman for the new millennium, imbued with the same aesthetic as Christian Bale's brooding Batman. The original identity that creators Joe Schuster and Jerry Siegel originally gave Superman in 1938 - that of an infallible, just, noble, patriotic super hero - has been largely abandoned. Instead, he is a more angst-ridden, tormented alien soul, stranded on Earth, haunted by the reality of his super powers, and in no way sure of his place in the world or his role within it. This modern obsession with making the unreal more real, darker, and more conflicted worked with Batman: he was always a more shadowy figure, lurking on the edge of society and doing the dirty work that others would not. Superman, however, is supposed to a beacon of hope: morally forthright, acting as a guiding light to whom the people of Earth can look for honesty and truth. This is not the Superman we see in Man of Steel.<br /><br />The film itself is a bit of a mess, a combination of hard science fiction and endlessly repetitive action sequences interspersed with a few genuinely effective moments of pathos and emotion, most of which take place during Superman's childhood in Kansas. English actor Henry Cavill plays the titular role, sent to Earth by his father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) from his dying home world, Krypton, after a simultaneous ecological disaster/military coup dooms the planet. 33 years later, the boy has grown up to become Clark Kent, a drifter and outcast who has enormous super powers that he does not understand and, occasionally, cannot control. However, things change when Zod (Michael Shannon), the Kryptonian General who led the coup, returns from exile and threatens the people of Earth unless the son of Jor-El reveals himself to them. Aided by tenacious journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and members of a distrusting US military, Clark must accept his identity and make a difficult choice: whether to aid Zod in his quest to find a new home world for what remains of the population of Krypton, or save his adopted planet from a terrible fate.<br /><br />Man of Steel does ask some interesting questions about identity and heritage, and the nature of super powers and what the discovery of their existence would mean in a real-world sense, which are explored mainly though the flashback sequences involving Diane Lane and an unexpectedly outstanding Kevin Costner as Clark's parents. However, this more cerebral approach is wholly abandoned in the film's second half, which quickly disintegrates into a series of seemingly endless fight sequences between CGI super heroes, during which people are constantly thrown through buildings, demolishing huge swathes of cities, killing thousands, and which are as boring as they are repetitive. The design and CGI effects are astonishingly good, but this cannot overcome the film's massive shortcomings, a great deal of which are to do with the moral ambiguity shown by several of the lead characters, and the almost complete absence of any semblance of fun or humor. This Superman is grim, deadly serious, and at times quite brutal, and for me represents an astonishing miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers in terms of what Superman is, and what he represents.<br /><br />Clearly, this new-style Superman is mirrored by its score, which is generally as grim, serious and brutal as the film itself. I suppose, in one respect, Zimmer has to score the film he is given. This is not the Superman of your father, with Christopher Reeve wearing the red cape, Richard Donner filming the action and John Williams wielding the baton, and that has to be acknowledged. In fact, probably the biggest thing that Man of Steel has going for it is the fact that it sounds nothing like the 1978 Superman score, and has no trace of John Williams's classic theme. Trying to fit the square peg of Williams's heroic, patriotic Americana march into this film's round hole would have been absolutely the wrong approach, and one has to at least admire the fact that Zimmer tried to come up with a brand new way of scoring the character. However, having said that, the music and the film are inseparable, and for me the music mirrors the problems that film has. Not only that, the score is irredeemably simple from a purely compositional standpoint, and has so little emotional content that it barely connects with its audience.<br /><br />Zimmer has said in interviews (and I'm paraphrasing here) that he wanted his music to capture the essence of middle America; the simplicity of life in Kansas, the white picket fences and the uncomplicated family oriented folk that Superman grew up amongst, and lives to protect. I can absolutely understand that approach, and in many ways it's a good one, but the problem comes through the fact that Zimmer has taken the essence of Superman and stripped it down so far, made it so simple and uncomplicated, that it's wholly unfulfilling, on both emotional and musical terms. Zimmer's theme for Superman is a two-note ascending motif (which reminds me of the first two notes of Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man - possibly intentional?), and it's all over the score, but for the vast majority of the score's running time it is left in such an undeveloped state that it's almost impossible to connect with. I have no problem with simplicity in itself; the most simple musical phrases can be perfect and beautiful, and have been on many occasions, but for film music to work there still has to be an emotional connection between composer, film and audience, and for me a theme with such brevity and so little growth offers me nothing to latch onto.<br /><br />This economy of emotion has become a running trend in Zimmer's work over the last couple of years, a sort of Zimmer minimalism which takes tiny fragments of a phrase and repeats them over and over, the prime examples being Batman's theme in Batman Begins, the Joker's theme in The Dark Knight, as well as large parts of Inception. Zimmer's enormous influence in this regard has seen this style spill over into other films by other composers, resulting in a film music trend, in Hollywood at least, that celebrates a lack of emotional content and strong, memorable themes as showing maturity and not spoon-feeding an audience in terms of what they are supposed to think and feel. As someone who grew up listening to and loving the work of Williams and Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner and John Barry, and many others, this attitude is the absolute antithesis of what I feel film music should aspire to be, and when the most successful films in Hollywood each year are usually scored by Zimmer, someone who currently works for or with Zimmer, or someone who used to work for Zimmer, it pains me because I can't see an end to the cycle. The more successful the film is, the more the studios will want to emulate the sound that film has, the more composers will be asked to sound like Zimmer, and so on and so on.<br /><br />But, back to Man of Steel. The main two-note theme is heard frequently throughout the score - it's virtually the first thing you hear, in \\"Look to the Stars\\", for tuned timpanis and bass guitar - and it's pleasant enough, but it simply never goes anywhere. It sounds the same at the beginning of the movie as it does in the middle of the movie as it does at the end of the movie, giving the whole score a sense of stagnancy. The only real changes it undergoes are in orchestration, or in key. It reappears in \\"Sent Here For a Reason\\" on a solo piano, the first of several statements in this manner, which usually accompany a Clark Kent Kansas childhood flashback sequence, and are actually quite pretty. The very end of \\"Tornado\\" and \\"This is Clark Kent\\" feature similar performances, but when the lead instrument for the motif switches to electric guitar, the music becomes heavily reminiscent of Zimmer's 1995 score Broken Arrow, albeit without Duane Eddy's spirited performances bringing a spark to the proceedings. It all sounds very much like an oddly unfinished chord, the base of a piece of music to which someone forgot to add the interesting thematic layer. It just sits there, listlessly, providing a texture, but not much else.<br /><br />The tension/drama music which typifies cues such as \\"DNA\\" and \\"Launch\\" employs the same basic rhythmic cello ostinatos that dominated The Dark Knight, Inception, The Da Vinci Code, and dozens of other scores by other composers, a cliché that has become tiresome over the last few years. The action music, in cues such as \\"Oil Rig\\", \\"Tornado\\", \\"You Die or I Do\\" and \\"Ignition\\", is actually quite obnoxious, featuring a gang of\\"celebrity drummers\\" bashing away on a number of enormous drums for anywhere between thirty seconds and three minutes, accompanied by Mel Wesson's patented electronic sound design washes, and an occasional interlude by a huge bank of horns all playing the same note simultaneously, over and over.<br /><br />The 9-minute \\"Terraforming\\" is perhaps the nadir of all this, with endlessly repeated percussion loops and blasting brass whole notes that are gradually joined by squealing, grating electronic \\"enhancements\\" that actually cause distortion in the speakers at their higher registers, such is their hideousness. One can only imagine that Zimmer took a listen to the eardrum-pummeling sampled MRI machine that Steve Jablonsky used in Battleship and wanted to top it in terms of headache-inducing chaos. Worse still, some of the percussion rhythms actually seem to be quite badly executed, never coming together as a coherent pattern. It's just messy and noisy, and poor from a purely compositional standpoint. Zimmer's action music used to be so rich, so powerful, so full of life and energy, that it makes you desperately nostalgic for scores like The Peacemaker, or Drop Zone, or Point of No Return, which were chock-full of interesting rhythmic ideas and clever touches in terms of pacing and tempo.<br /><br />Every now and again, a piece of music does pique the interest briefly, reminding the listener what a good composer Zimmer can be when he wants to be. The middle section of \\"Krypton's Last\\" has an unexpectedly beautiful violin solo that is quite touching. Similarly, parts of \\"I Have So Many Questions\\" feature a solo cello and wordless vocal combination that is very soothing. The vocally-inflected \\"Goodbye My Son\\", as well as the last minute or so of the aforementioned \\"Terraforming\\", has a quite nice timbre to it that reminds me of the processed vocal work in The Peacemaker back in 1997, but this brief nostalgic flashback only raises the interest briefly, before it's back tothe familiar sound of churning cellos, electric guitars, and rock percussion.<br /><br />To give the score its fair dues, the score does contain two fairly good cues: the conclusive pair, \\"Flight\\" and \\"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\\". Here, and only here, does Zimmer's two note theme show any sign of development of heroic intent. \\"Flight\\" is out of order (the cue actually occurs about half way through the film, when Clark accepts his identity and learns to fly for the first time), but does have a sense of grandeur to it that is quite welcome, although the electric guitar chords are a little grating at times. \\"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\\" is, by a long margin, the best cue on the album, for the one simple reason that Zimmer finally allows his two-note theme a little room to breathe and grow, building over the course of five and a half minutes with increasingly optimistic progressions, until it finally emerges into the one, true, heroic anthemic statement of hope and glory in the entire score. However, these two halfway decent cues come too little too late, and are not enough to salvage the rest of the score from its pit of disappointment.<br /><br />The score concludes with a gargantuan 28-minute piece called \\"Man of Steel (Hans' Original Sketchbook)\\", the original suite of music which Zimmer wrote on his computer outlining his thematic ideas and textural choices, and from which his team of composers, arrangers and orchestrators formed the actual meat of the score. It's interesting that Zimmer would actually include this sketchbook cue on the album, as in the past Zimmer has been somewhat reluctant to admit that he actually works this way, but you can certainly hear the genesis of all the ideas in this piece. I do wonder just who will listen to this cue more than once, however, considering that it is essentially little more than a synth mockup of the score without any context, cue breaks, or live instruments.<br /><br />This review is of the standard release of the score; a longer \\"special edition\\" of the score also exists, which comes presented in a natty metallic box, and features six additional cues - \\"Are You Listening, Clark?\\", \\"General Zod\\", \\"You Led Us Here\\", \\"This is Madness!\\", \\"Earth\\" and \\"Arcade\\", four of which feature additional music by the Dutch composer/musician Tom Holkenborg AKA Junkie XL. These cues present, by and large, more of the same, except that the electronic/synthetic element is much more prominent in Holkenborg's cues.<br /><br />So, here's the bottom line. I understand that Man of Steel is a different film than the original Superman and its sequels, and as much as I dislike the changes made to the nature of Superman, and as much as I feel that these changes represent a gross miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers, I acknowledge that these changes were made, and that as a result Zimmer's score had to change too. A John Williams-style score would not have been appropriate for this film, and so the fact that Zimmer chose to go in a different direction was entirely the right decision. What disappoints me more than anything is the lack of emotional content resulting from the decision to strip down the thematic content to its absolute bare bones, as well as the apparent lack of ambition inherent in the failure to create a new and interesting sonic world for Superman to inhabit. Superman is THE iconic American super-hero, a beacon of light and hope and justice for the world. For him to be saddled with witless percussion, such predictable string writing, and such a simplistic and repetitive thematic statement is disappointing in the extreme.
B000093FLA|1.0|I just couldn't get into the story.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is a very good actor in other movies like Inglourious Basterds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good game. The new update includes includes minecraft realms. No more free multiplayer. When its released it will be an optional paid service. But i still recommend this game. So worth the seven dollars
B001TODCII|5.0|This is a terrific action movie that's got a great story and acting.  It'll keep you in suspense.  It's not the typical stupid movie where it's all special effects with stupid actors.  Highly recommended!  If you're a parent, this is a must see movie.  If you like Taken, you should watch the Japanese movie &#34;The Man From Nowhere&#34;.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My children love playing this game anytime they're bored and need to pass time. I wish there were more ways for them to earn the things they need to play, rather than having to buy things.
B000M341QE|3.0|Story is kind of predictable but the acting is awesome.<br /><br />There's better action movies with great stories like TAKEN or LEON THE PROFESSIONAL or DJANGO UNCHAINED.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I am pretty sure Kanye has been secretly listening to and taking note from the innovative group Death Grips, because it sounds like stylistically he is ripping them off.  The only difference is that this is auto-tuned, more accessible, and the lyrics are trash.  I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case, since Kanye has no shame in having ghost producers and taking credit for other people's work.  To give him some credit, it was cool that he wasn't afraid to try something different (for him) when he had all these mainstream eyes on him.  Some of the beats are good, because he had Daft Punk produce (or co-produce?) a couple of them.  As usual, Kanye's lyrics are hypocritical, arrogant, ignorant, and at times racist.  If you like this because you think it's innovative, go get the real thing and check out some Death Grips.  You will get better lyrics, more original production, and no auto-tune.

B00DF0POXA|2.0|I like all four of Kanye West's regular albums; his College Dropout debut and the three that follow a similar soundscape. Even when he's sampling old soul songs, his music represents vintage hip-hop more than anything else. This Yeezus project, like 808s And Heartbreak, comes across as more of an experimental departure. There is plenty of romance, and sex; at one point, he's \\"eating\\" his girlfriend's butt; but instead of 808 drums and Autotune singing, it's dominated by fuzzy distortion and spacey sound effects. They penetrate almost every cut, which shouldn't be a problem for anyone who appreciates the genres of techno. The problem, more than the fact that the rapper never really spits a proper rap verse; his flow these days consists mostly of chanty poetry; is the lack of a catchy chorus.<br /><br />One could be a savior to any of these songs. Instead Mister West, once a humble student, simply says he's a God over and over again, emphasizing the word \\"am\\" as if to taunt his many detractors. They say his ego has gotten out of control, so he makes it even bigger. And even if the \\"God\\" thing is just a lazy metaphor, he compares himself to \\"Michael\\" in what seems to be an earnest assertion. If he's referring to Jackson or Jordan, even Tyson, he's delusional. He's talented, but not as talented as he seems to think. So when he releases what sounds like a demo album that's void not only of melodic hooks but boom-bap beats, he leaves much to be desired. Too much of the music is soulless and spiritless. The Blood and Bound vocal samples are annoying. Yeezus gets no praise from me.<br /><br />marcellee.com

1623420148|2.0|I bought this book due to its 5 stars but did not read any reviews. On finishing I went in to read what I obviously missed about the greatness of this book. Maybe this book targets a different sense of humour than mine, but there were no LOL moments, and quite a few \\"erk\\" moments (calling in a favour from the personnel dept for someone's home number? That's way beyond creepy). The sex is OK; I've read better. The relationship is one step past a lawsuit: no means no. No doesn't mean send flowers, balloons, a mariachi band to someone just starting out in a new company (and conveniently nobody for her to turn to, except for the 'golden son\\" of the firm).  And most certainly \\"no\\" does not mean call in a favour from the personnel department and call the home number in the middle of the night.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|This discography is destined to become a true collectors' item. The stories soar through the music and transport the listener to a higher place. Few artists are able to achieve pathos, irony, longing and mystery in such an evocative and seductive way as Joni Mitchell.

B001N1DPDE|3.0|The knife and sheath itself are a great product, but it stops there when it comes to the nylon webbing material used on the sheath. It's WAY too soft, and the snap has already pulled out of the nylon (After less than 1 day.). I had to use a metal grommet in it's place. Flops around on your belt way too much. The sheath is great, the knife is great, but the rest is a pain. will have to find a different and better material to attach to the sheath to make it as durable as the rest of it.

0679805273|5.0|This book makes a very special gift for a graduating high school senior.  Encourages them to go for their dreams.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|Saw this in 3D and thought it was absolutely fantastic. Full of contrasts -- rich/poor, black/white, and of course, gay/tragic. Wonderful, vivid and colourful presentation of the Jazz Age in this brilliant dramatic tale of a once \\"poor\\" man still trying to realize the American dream. The party scenes/music/costumes et al were spectacular! Not American so not exactly sure what the American dream is (rising from poverty to great wealth and fame?!) but was completely engrossed in the visuals as well as the story and acting. Read the book many, many years ago and this was a nice way to relive Fitzgerald's finest work. Have in the past seen DiCaprio in several films but I think he outdid himself here. There were moments when he reminded me of Marlon Brando, that's how good I think his performance was. Impressed with almost everything about this film -- only thing that I found very odd is when Gatsby visited Carraway's house for an \\"accidental\\" meeting with Daisy, gets wet in the rain and comes in with dripping hair and clothes but a moment later, his clothes all appear dry!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I enjoy the author's historical and somewhat romantic account. I love that there is no cussing and vulgarity. It is a light, pleasant, and relaxing read.

0307341577|5.0|Twenty-five years after Libby Day fled into the snow as her mother and two sisters were brutally murdered,  the trust fund that she's been living off of is almost completely drained and Libby is facing the unpleasant truth that the people who were so anxious to help the only survivor of The Satan Sacrifices of Kinnakee, Kansas have lost all interest in her. When a representative of  the Kill Club, a group obsessed with famous murders, offers her cash to speak at their next meeting, Libby reluctantly agrees.  Her need for money is enough to force her to finally dig through the sealed boxes of her family's possessions looking for things she can sell to the members of the club. For more money, she agrees to visit her brother in prison, then to look up her estranged father. The more people from her past she makes contact with, the more Libby begins to question what actually happened in the farmhouse that night.<br /><br />Dark Places absolutely blew me away. The chapters alternate between Libby in the present day and her brother and mother in 1985, on the day of the murders. The way that the events and evidence all tie together is so intricate -- what makes perfect sense one way when a character sees it is obviously something else entirely when you're reading from another character's point of view.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This show was amazing when it first aired and I still love it.  Action, suspense, great characters.  Summer Glau does an amazing job with this part. Wish they had gone more than two seasons, but I'll take the reruns since that's all I can get!

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I never thought QOTSA would top \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" but I enjoyed their last two offerings all the same and would have been perfectly happy if the new album had been on par with \\"Era Vulgaris.\\"<br /><br />Instead, \\"...Like Clockwork\\" blew away my expectations. \\"Rated R\\" and \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" may have cemented QOTSA's position as one of the great hard rock bands of our time, but this is their magnum opus. I loved the album from the first play through, and it has only increased in my estimations after each listen.<br /><br />At only ten songs, the album is short, but it is so cohesive and consistent in quality that this is instantly forgiven. There is no filler here. In fact, after playing it through at least a dozen times, I have yet to skip a single track. Josh and crew are at the peak of their powers here; killer hooks, dark, haunting lyrics, and expertly layered compositions abound.<br /><br />The album lacks tracks with the immediacy or radio-friendliness of singles like \\"No One Knows\\" or \\"Go With the Flow,\\" which perhaps explains why many reviewers have commented that it has to grow on you. What you get instead is some of the best and most mature writing in Homme's career. \\"I Appear Missing\\" in particular is destined to go down as one of the greatest songs QOTSA (or any other rock band for that matter) has ever put out there; it builds in layers and creeps up on you in a dark and infectious way until you can't get it out of your head. Superb opener, \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled,\\" and the brilliantly titled, \\"Kalopsia,\\" (look it up!) add to the dark ambience.<br /><br />And don't worry, the album can still rock face too, thanks to hard hitters like \\"My God is the Sun\\" and \\"Fairweather Friends,\\" with guest appearances by Elton John (who saw that coming?), Trent Reznor, and old friend, Dave Grohl, among others.<br /><br />If you're already a QOTSA fan, order this right now because you won't be disappointed. And if you're not, do yourself a favor and pick this up - you soon will be.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a great movie when you want to escape into a world where the good guys win.  Not overly complex but has a good plot.  There are several great lines to use in conversations.  I love the pig.
0807014273|5.0|This is a superb book about the will to survive. It is not so much about a Holocaust survivor's story in prison camp but instead is about the choices we make and the attitude we choose in life. The hook is superb and really caused me to think.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Very good movie, excellent quality. The extras are very good, has a lot of information about making the movie and the actors. I cannot get tired of see it over and over again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was getting annoyed at the &quot;hidden objects&quot; games where you just looked for things so i looked for something more complex and found this one. This game was awesome. It challenges your puzzle skills in an exciting way that is different with each room. It reminds me of Myst, but a lot shorter. The graphics though are amazing. Loved it!!!!!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|What I mean by quality is that although I loved that is all movies in one single box (I don't have a lot space), the quality of the box is not very good. I open and now it doesn't close. I don't know it was just me or is a very bad quality. At least it is a box inside another box. So I can close it with that.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Wife and I seriously thought Dexter had jumped the shark on season 6.  I found that season simply a waste of time and stupid. But alas, the writers and producers have tried to get back to the formula that worked.  Still not close to the original five seasons, but we like it again.

B005LAIH2M|5.0|The critics just don't get it, don't understand it and never will. This isn't a deep movie. IT is what it is, but what that is is a heck of a lot of fun! Great action flick with wonderful graphics and a decent story line. Absolutely ADORE Jeremy in this one! It is far from Jeremy's best performance, but Hansel isn't the deepest character to begin with so it shouldn't be expected. And Gemma's Gretel really steals the show! Great performance by all the cast, lots of fun and body parts flying. Don't take it too seriously. This is a popcorn movie, and one well worth being added to my collection! Can't wait for the sequel. :)

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book series is WAY better than the 50 Shades series.  The sex isn't as twisted and taboo.  The plot is deeper, the character development is better and the writing style is leagues above the 50 Shades series.  I CAN'T wait for the next book in this series.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this book taught some beautiful lessons on true humanity and what can become of us when we give in to what we know is not right!!  It's a story you won't want to stop reading, and it transports you to another world, a sad and dreary world where people are not treated with respect or kindness, where hunger is the norm in the districts, but the people of the Capital eat delicacies and live in luxury. The conflict richly works within as well as outside the characters you will grow to love.  Trust me, you won't want to stop at Book one.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Play always all the time cause it rocks my socks off no other game compares to this epic creation ever.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|As a long time reader of this series I was disappointed.  I can see Sookie with Sam and her being happy at a pinch.  However, the twelve books previously didn't set up the ending, the plot in this book is weak (kidnapped!!!!.............again!!!!!!), the ending was rushed and I was rather bored. It felt like the minor characters had their stories tied up just to be finished and the charm and light heartedness of the earlier books was missing.<br /><br />My dislike of this book is not just a \\"dummy spit\\" because Sookie and Eric are not together.  It is because the writing was substandard when compared to the other books in the series.  The story was dragged out too long.  And...let's not go into the \\"literary fangbanger\\" debate.  Really Ms Harris?<br /><br />I've been a long time fan of the writing of Ms Harris, it's not fine fiction or world changing but I've enjoyed it.  Am I an \\"entitled reader\\"? Well, as some one who has an opinion....Yes I am!  Ms Harris has the right to write her characters/story how she will.  I have the right not to read, and I will be exercising my right in this matter.
B008861R7S|5.0|The album itself gets 5 stars. No wonder it is the most acclaimed solo Wu-Tang project. The RZA produces the whole album (minus the B.I.B.L.E. track) and it features multiple appearances from other members of the group. Every feature is nice. With this special edition release you get the original album and a second CD containing all the instrumentals except B.I.B.L.E. Although some of the tracks still have the spoken intros, most of the tracks are what you would expect.<br /><br />The box that it comes in also serves as a mini chess board on the inside. The game pieces are adequately efficient if you actually plan on using them. They are about 1 inch in height and have felt bases. If you were planning on using the game board as a display piece, it might only look decent on a small coffee table if anything.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is worth purchasing for the instrumentals alone. Great release that even the slightest Wu-Tang fan would appreciate.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|What a great writer this guy is. His Will Robie stories are the best of any spook novels. I also love hos Camel Club series. CAn't wait for the next one.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|After having this book recommended to me time and again I decided to read it. Not my cup of tea. I like good romance novel every once in a while, but this was a little much. I feel like all the explicit sex scenes took away from developing a good plot. I found myself not feeling very attached to the main characters, Ana and Christian, and could honestly care less what happens. Will not be reading books 2 or 3.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham has a knack for hooking this reader with his story telling. This book is no exception. BUT The Racketeer isn't his best effort.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|A great collection for any Stevie Ray Vaughn fan, You really can't go wrong with this one! He is the best!
B00007GZR5|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and I thought it was visually stunning, emotionally heart plucking, philosophically uplifting and jammed with authentic and true acting. I got the chance to see the last forty minutes again on TV just a few minutes ago and my initial reaction hadn't changed. I remember the movie being bashed and laughed at and decided to come on Amazon to see if people had changed their minds. Four stars and 600 plus ratings later, I was happy to see that people had. In these difficult times when we lose loved one way too often, this movie is hope-filled and a balm against such loss. More than that, it is a testament to the power of love. There are a few sayings about love: that it is forever and can overcome any obstacle. This movie brings both to light. I applaud the director, the cast and the crew. This has become a timeless classic for myself and many many others...
B0063IH60K|4.0|An easy way to play a game that I have always enjoyed. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the ads.
0307346609|5.0|This book was bomb.  I LOVED the way Brooks wrote this.  It's a great, new take on a zombie apocalypse.  It doesn't focus on the actual apocalypse happening, but it follows the journeys of a few critical people in a few nations all over the world.  It focuses on how the world might react in such an emergency.  It was much more personal and thought-provoking than the average undead story.  This is a must-read for anyone interested in zombie paraphernalia!
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|The story line was nearly appalling. I watch a lot of movies and this was one of the worst I've seen.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My kids  and I love this! Spent many hours together working on the levels. Easy to play but it does make you think!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|From the very beginning of this book I was hooked!  Reading &#34;Ready Player One &#34; has taken my imagination to new heights and has renewed my love of reading! Ernest Cline is truly a master at writing, I cannot wait for his next book. I also can't wait for a movie to be made of this terribly engrossing and very interesting book. Bravos, Kudos, and Thumbs-up to Ernest Cline!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|This is a must have for any Lenny Kravitz fan, amazing bargain, fast shipping and the music is smokin' hot! Great selection.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I think the game is very good and it's free.!!  There are lots of cute animals and you get to catch them in different habitats.
B005LAII1C|5.0|- Some of the dialogues are  ORIGINALY HILARIOUS. For example, the ones listed below (I don't remember the exact words, but the idea is the same)<br /><br />John: \\"Do you think I need to buy her a ring after being together for 4 years?\\"<br /><br />Ted: \\"What?...\\"<br />The reply is so unexpected and humorous.<br /><br />- The conversations are funny but profane. There are a lot of F*** and S****. So, this movie is not for children.<br /><br />- The interesting special effect brings Ted to life.<br /><br />- Mark Wahlberg's and Mila Kunis's acting are wonderful. The way they talked to Ted looked as if Ted had been a real person.<br /><br />- Surprisingly, there are some touching scenes and characters' depth. So, it's not a hollow comedy. The question is \\"Are you willing to end the relationship with your childhood friend to spend all your time with your longtime girlfriend?\\". Ted's and Mila's actions touched my heart.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film<br /><br />Production Budget: $50 million<br />Domestic:  $218,815,487<br />+ Foreign:  $330,552,828<br />= Worldwide:  $549,368,315<br /><br />So, it's popular both in North America and overseas. Its profit is more than 9 times its budget. Wow!<br />It deserves 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Requires you to think the entire time and continues to get harder and harder as you pass more levels, it's good for working your brain.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love, love, love this show!!!  It's so addicting.  If you haven't seen the first two seasons, do yourself a favor and start!  Highly recommend!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is extremely entertaining for myself, my children and my grandchildren...great on a cold and or rainy day....I recommend
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved it - very engaging - wonderful characters and special effects.  Sorry I didn't see it in 3D.<br />Looking forward to seeing more Hobbit movies.....
B00005Q3DX|1.0|This film was shot in english the advertisement on amazon was in english, and NOWHERE did it say it was in another language! At all! WASTE OF MONEY! Id love a refund.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|First off, Big NIN fan, radiohead fan, huge kanye fan even loved 808's, still bump that daily.  And I was a radiohead fan before kid A dropped, but still loved Kid A anyway. Good music is good music (no pun intended). This is not good music despite what the label says.  This is overall just a heap of trash and an experiment gone wrong. Ye should have taken more time and not \\"stripped down\\" the beats like rubin told him to.  Not sure why he needed to bring someone like rubin in when he's been such a great creative genius on his own for some time. (have to admit I like Rubin's sound generally too, so don't call me a hater here).<br /><br />There are only 2 songs I can even get into on this cd. the one with cheif keef and blood on the leaves. And blood on the leaves is sorta weird when you understand what the soul loop is talking about, and how Kanye is trying to relate that to an adventure with some random girl and gold digging. Real disrespectful and ignorant on that front, and makes that song sorta difficult for me to like despite how good it sounds.<br /><br />Bound 2 is more like classic kanye except where kanye would normally take a beat and mix it up, put some synths over it and make it sound dope, all he does here is take a loop and rap over it. No drum overlays or anything.  So weak.  Sounds like some of the free music he puts out on G.O.O.D. friday, not something he should use as the last song on a 10 song disc.<br /><br />The songs are all over the place, unstructured, unfocused, poor transitions, and overall just way too simple. Simple lyrics, simple beats, simple production.  For people to call this genius is giving genius a bad name, even giving kanye's previous cd's a very bad name. Not sure how much more I can take of kanye doing things with my spouse and things he's putting in their mouths. 10 tracks and he references chapelle's rick james \\"couch\\" skit on two of them, even though he's referenced that in songs on other cd's.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in this uninspired rushed cd and this sounds strange but i'm even more disappointed in all of the critics and fans on here calling this cd a work of art or genius.  It's trash and I hope ye comes out with a remixed version of what this cd might have sounded like if he took some more time with it.<br /><br />I'm gonna stick with 808's when I want emo kanye. I've already played this out and never coming back to it.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I change my mind. This game is a freaken glitch. When I play the game weird stuff happens. Like the game freezes or the coins get all bunched up together. The games even gets the straight lines on it that will make it look like your kindle is messed up. I tried everything to fix this game. I still play the game though. All they have to do is take off the big ERROR. If you don't want a game that is stupid than I suggest that you don't get this game. This game needs to be fixed.
B00D8WJ9JK|3.0|I liked most of the beats, and can get into his vibe, but dude is soooo preachy I feel like I'm getting reprimanded all the time.  As if he's always trying to teach you something but it's so in your face it just makes me feel bad about myself lol.  Really liked the song about Nas, probably because he's reprimanding himself and not the listener.  And the bonus tracks are nice as well.<br /><br />One thing that stood out after the first listen was all the name drops, but I think Game needs to take a listen to this cd to figure out how to \\"respectfully\\" name drop without sounding like a jock rider all the time. J. Cole did a good job giving props to the old cats who came before him with some of his beat choices and name drops. Especially like the beat where he took from the same song that electric relaxation came from. That's one of my favorite tribe songs and dude remixed that sample real nice.<br /><br />Overall this is a good cd but no classic. I'll listen to it for the few tracks I really like but it will probably fall out of rotation in the next few months, just like the previous J Cole cd did.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Would have loved for the great escape to be closer to the end.  It was pretty good, I just needed more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its fun 2 play cause u have 2 use your mind in order 2 play this game. but if u don't lik 2 think don't get it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's very competitive and fun. It takes a true genius to play this game. Once again it's very fun. It may take a lil while before you can escape. But just when you are ready to give up the answer is always right there in front of you the whole time.
0446580848|5.0|the panther is excellent, i am waiting for his new book to come out soon. Read him he is great
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have owned two Garmin devices, the Forerunner 305 and the 405CX. The 305 worked fine but it is bulky and must be downloaded via a USB cable.  No big deal but I purchased the 405CX as a step up.<br /><br />On more than one occasion the 405CX simply went dead even with a full charge. I contacted Garmin and they gave me instructions how to reset the device but the instructions proved helpless. In frustration  I took the back plate off - try to go and find a hexnut that small - reassembled it and put it back on line for recharging and lo and behold the screen came back to life and all was fine.<br /><br />Then on the morning of a marathon the screen again went blank and one minute prior to the start it came back to life as if by divine intervention.<br /><br />Last week during a six mile run the screen again went blank yet again.  I called Garmin for support, told them of the reoccurring problems and I was told that because the device was purchased 18 months ago that for $110 I can send it to Garmin for them to assess the problem!!!! Planned obsolescence I guess. If they fix it I will probably owe nearly the cost of a new device.  But it won't be a Garmin.<br /><br />After searching online for advice how to address the problem I see that this is an ongoing problem.<br /><br />I will never buy a Garmin again.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Never read anything by Neil Gaiman before - I think I'm glad I started with American Gods - very thought-provoking.  Not sure I could delve into another one of his books right away but definitely will after my brain settles down from this one some.
B001LF347E|4.0|Not a bad show- reasonably entertaining, and its ok for kids to watch.  I would say it's worth checking out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|reminiscent of floors or &quot;the box&quot; on apple devices! certainly makes you think in creative ways!<br />different levels keep you intrigued! wanted more levels when I was done!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Still an entertaining show and worth checking out.  A fairly short season, though, not many episodes-  would hae liked to see more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it but the computer kind has all animals and so I'm going to save up and buy a computer.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|It's a very good recommendation from Amazon with my watching habits. It's fun to watch with whole family. My 3 year old also loves it.
0345525558|5.0|For me, there's nothing better than that combination. I've given copies to other family members who enjoy the same things. I especially love the encyclopedia of the Victorian meanings of flowers at the end of the book. It has made me look at my choices of garden plants in a whole new way.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think this book is so cute. It really inspires me to write a book based on me and my life at school.
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|A sweet and easy read.  Not a fast paced novel for sure.  But a good relaxing read for the weekend.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app!  It is not a &quot;rude awakening&quot; unless you want it to be and it soothes you awake.  I liked that you could have the option to do math problems to wake yourself up, too.  Over all, this is the best alarm app and most helpful app I have ever downloaded.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|Tom Cruise is no Reacher.  First he is not tall or broad enough.  Second he's too old for this part.  Third If he wanted to be noticed for this picture he should have paid more attention to the books.  Then he would have realized that there are people who read the books Lee Child has written on this character.  The cast was perfect but his portrayal of Reacher was sadly lacking.  Do yourself a favor invest in the books not the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine craft is the best because you can have friend play with you and help you fight zombies and creepers in world
1594136335|5.0|excellent..unbelievable character ,elizabeth, was..very well written..i really admire philippa and her knowledge of that era.<br />get the feeling you are right there. decription of anne clothing was so &#34;real&#34;..you could picture her..i've recommended this book to others...it was my book club's choi8ce..we are reviewing it this evening...
1451668945|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has met all expectations. How she comes up with these great stories is wonderful. She is second in my book only to Agatha Christie. Kudos!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Nice game. Enjoyed it very much. Nice and long, unlike other games, which are sometimes too brief and leave you wanting more.
B000006NUW|5.0|It's &#34;The Funk Brothers&#34; playing with the best singers and songwriters that brought rhythm and blues to the pop charts. It feels good just to let the cd's roll and soothe the soul.
0307744434|2.0|I often rate my favorite books by their ability to draw me into the characters in such a way that it almost feels like I've made a new friend.  This book lacked any serious character development, and I didn't find most of the characters all that interesting.  There are lots of characters throughout the book, but most of them are shallow.  I also appreciate books that get me so engrossed that it's difficult to put them down.  Not so with this book.  I struggled to get through it.  There was never a climactic point in the book, and the ending felt as if the author just ran out of ideas and needed some way to wrap it up.
B006H5120E|5.0|Ordered this after reading some reviews about the 3d effect.  Definitely a new favorite. I think my wife and I enjoyed it more the 2nd time around on the home 3d then in the theatre.  Details are amazing and the 3d just adds beautiful depth as opposed to just jumping out at you.  Well worth the price and you get the regular and dvd versions as well.
B004ZQ74G8|5.0|Loved this book.I actually couldn't put it down.Well written and very introspective, especially given the subject matter.Emma Donoghue could be my next favourite author!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|When I read the description I was doubtful that I would like this show, but seeing that it was a long running show I gave it a try. The first episode did not blow me away but once I got into the second and third episodes I was hooked. I really enjoy this show and like seeing what will happen next.<br />It's suspenseful, funny, smart, and very entertaining.<br />If you like sci-fi and enjoy fantasy and time travel you’ll like this show. Kind of reminds me of the 2002 movie “The Time Machine”
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun to play when you have nothing to do or have play time to yourself.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Really, this was the most annoying book I ever read!! It does nothing to further the story along besides **SPOILER*** The quickie marriage.  She made Ava into this immature, no self worth woman and Gideon into a  puppy dog in love. Create angst where there was none.<br /> Now this series is going from 3 books to 5.  Sylvia Day is just ridiculous!!! She lost me as a customer and am so disgusted with book #3 I really don't care how this ends.. What a BUNCH OF BULL never buying anything from her again!!
B003NX76BM|5.0|Suspenseful, funny, passion-filled, and educational. What more could a reader want. Be or become a dog-lover and you will know.<br /><br />\\"We all protect each other, that's how it works.\\"
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King shows as always what an excellent writer he is with just about any material. The experience of reading this far-out story is the big draw; it may or may not hold up quite as well on subsequent readings. Much is predictable if you've read King stories before, but then again if you haven't then why are you bothering with this one? Regular readers will pick it up and enjoy the good yarn.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|it was a great pet story, that showed just how loyal your pet can be.it was by far, the best pet story I've ever seen. can you really imagine that kind of loyalty.<br /><br />  BG
B004CRR9G0|5.0|All his films are great a most are very family friendly.  The artwork and voice casting for the English versions are great too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Anyone who is interested in learning about SEAL`s involvement in the Iraqi war should read this. CHIEF Kyle tells a brilliant story of actions he was involved in and his wife provides a perspective from home front I've never considered.  He is an inspiration to follow.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Can't wait for the next one. I was glued to every page of this book. Buy it NOW you absolutely won't regret it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It was perfect. I recomenda it. I AM Vera much ied with my purshaced.<br />For sure I will buy whatever I might need in the Amazon.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was excellent. The characters and writing were both very good. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|sweet game<br />. I appreciate a good game when they come out this one is pretty good keeps ya playing. for a while
B00908DDZM|5.0|Not much more to say. I was pretty much hooked when I had first heard some of their songs before they started playing on the radio .Ended up enjoying all of their music so I wanted to support them by buying their CD.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Omg. Where can I get me a Gideon?  The book sucked me in and didn't let me go. Cannot wait for the next one. Sylvia is great about giving just enough info about the main characters. Great suspense!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|If you're looking for an incredible gaming mouse for a great price, I highly recommend getting this mouse. I personally am not a big fan of spending $50.00 or more on a mouse because quite honestly, I don't see the difference between a gaming and a regular mouse aside from more buttons. But, my mouse was on it's last legs so seeing I'm a big gamer, I decided I might as well try to find a cheap good quality gaming mouse. I'm very glad I picked this one. It does everything I want it to. The buttons on the side are a huge help and you can program them to your liking when you install it. You can also change the color of the anker logo on the mouse which in my opinion, is awesome. Again, I highly recommend this mouse. I couldn't be anymore pleased with my purchase :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it! I'm so glad I bought this. I even found Derpy. She still exists! Buy this app. Tottaly worth it!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|There are so many ways parents can harm children.  But children who are left in the hands of strangers are even more vulnerable to the many ways adults mistreat them or neglect them.  This book shows just how difficult it is to grow up without love, and to be deprived of knowing how to express love when you finally meet someone you could love.  It is, in the end, a book about learning how to communicate love.  In this instance, the flowers were the medium for expressing love.  It's a very interesting book and all my book group enjoyed it.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I just couldn't get into it. The stories are decent but it jumps around too much for me. Got to about 2/3 of the way through it before throwing in the towel.
0553801473|4.0|A Dance with Dragon is a sprawling tome of epic proportions that further expands the A Song of Ice and Fire universe but does not provide any resolutions to the plethora of dangling plot threads from the previous books. It helped reading Dance with Dragons on the heels of A Feast for Crows since gave me a clearer picture of the parallel story arc. Yet with so many pending questions, cliffhangers, resurrections, and prophecies, A Dance with Dragons felt  fragmented and unfocused. I was especially frustrated that Dany and her dragons seem to be perpetually stuck in political quagmire. I really hope with the next book that Dany and the dragons get moving, I'm sick to death of the stagnant Meereen storyline. I want to know who will ride the three dragons for the second dance with dragons.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I found myself fully engrossed with the intrigues of the feudal medieval world of Westeros and it was good to see some favorites characters again. I especially enjoyed the aftermath of scheming, power-hungry Cersei's public humiliation and I was blown away with the revelations of Varys true motivation. At this point, there are still a handful of characters left that I hope and root for (Daenerys, Bran, Jon Snow, Aegon, Arya, and Davos). I also want to stick around in case the Lannisters, Boltons, and Freys will get their comeuppance sooner rather than later. Now I join the long line of waiters for the sixth book in the series, The Winds of Winter, and hope that the next book will move towards a coherent, ultimate ending.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very addictive, like a book that makes you keep turning the pages.  Can't wait for Season 4 to start next January.
0142413860|5.0|Bought it as a present for a friend's kid! He really enjoyed it, mostly because of the cd so that he could listen while looking at the wonderful drawings!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|The puzzles are not super easy. You will have to think out side the box. I love them and my 5year old son helps out too.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Nice graphics. Fun game. Kept me addicted for hours. Some of the puzzles were quite challenging. Probably too difficult for the kids
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Most movies Cruise does are pretty good.  I rate this one high.  Rosamund Pike was lovely as usual.  The story line is somewhat of a remake but worth the watch.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Started reading it after watching the first season. Way better than the tv show. The attention to detail the author has put into the book is amazing.
B00AXVHHTI|4.0|Real cool show. It's funny becauswe we didn't watch it for a long time. We LOVE Upstairs Downstairs and felt this was surely just a copycat. and in many ways it does copy elements from U.D. but when we finally gave this a try, we loved every second. as a matter of fact, after seeing all 3 seasons, we thought it'd be fun to go back to Upstairs Downstairs and it wass NOT as good as we remembered it to be! Doh! Downton Abbey raised the bar several layers!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am already excited for what's to come! Can't wait to read and watch how the hunger games plays out!
B008HFWF3U|4.0|Having owned the DVD for a while, I put off buying this as I sort of already had the music in a fine surround mix. But I had heard the stereo version was worth hearing and I'm so glad I bought it. First of all, since this was recorded after Metheny had toured the project, so he had the chance to live with these tunes, the result being his improvisations are much more fully developed.<br /><br />I suspect he also tweaked the arrangements a bit, but it's hard to tell because this mix is so much clearer than the 1st album. You can hear the layered percussion in better detail and somehow, whereas the 1st album felt somewhat attenuated dynamically, this album seems to have more dynamic depth. I am wondering if over time, Metheny found ways to optimize the robotic orchestra and milk some more dynamics out of it. In general the music seems to breathe a little more.<br /><br />The other good news is the inclusion of the two improvisations. Improvisation 1 is relatively simple, a setting of mostly guitar and a single tambourine, similar to how he opened his live shows before the curtain dramatically opened to reveal the entire rig. The 2nd improvisation is similar to what he was doing on the road, a minimalist modal thing that with the addition of more and more layers, finally opens up into a grand guitar solo and then comes down dramatically to a few bells, cymbals, marimba and a (rarely used here) synth pad. It works really well.<br /><br />Due to a fortuitous sequencing accident that put all the material in alphabetical order, (which Merheny eventually came to love,) the Orchestrion suite is spread out here, interspersed with reimagined arrangements of older tunes and the aforementioned improvisations. The \\"accidental\\" order works really well- the whole album feels of a piece.  I particularly liked the Orchestrion arrangement of \\"Tell Her You Saw Me\\" from Secret Story. The use of the blown bottles is haunting and a perfect fit for this bittersweet rumination on lost love. Less successful is the new version of \\"Antonia\\"-despite Metheny's obvious effort to add in rubato tempo mapping and interesting colors, the thing still feels quite mechanical to me. It just doesn't come close to the breadth and majesty of the original. The \\"Orchestrion Suite\\" however, has improved greatly. The ambitious \\"Orchestrion\\" is a vast improvement over the original, a real barn stormer of a performance with a mix that greatly underscores Metheny's incredibly resourceful use of the Orchestrion. I cant emphasize enough how superior this mix is. The same could be said for \\"Entry Point\\", a tune that would've completely fit in comfortably on a PMG album. You can almost forget you're listening to a robotic orchestra. Of course, it's Pat's playing that makes it all open up, which is a real testimony to his musicianship. It's this extraordinary human that makes it all come to life.Less successful is the new version of \\"Antonia\\"-despite Metheny's obvious effort to add in rubato tempo mapping and interesting colors, the thing still feels quite mechanical to me.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best out of the three.  Brings out all sort of emotions. I laughed, gasped and cried! The series is definitely a must read.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Does what I need, exactly as I need it to do! We have to have &quot;noise&quot; to be able to fall asleep. This app has plenty of different noises to fill that need. When we forget to bring along a fan for our &quot;white noise&quot;, I always have my phone, so we are able to get a good night's sleep! Thanks!!!
B002L2GK0O|5.0|Even though the old edition is available online, in fact because it IS available online, this book is worth the purchase. So much valuable information for the first or long time home brew.
1476733953|5.0|I really enjoyed the Wool saga. I kept wanting to read more! It's definitely worth more than what you pay for.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is by far the most interesting and entertaining game I have ever had downloaded on my kindle. The graphics are amazing. It well thought out. It can be frustrating getting stuck on a clue but I want to thank the creator's for not &quot;dumbing down&quot; this game  I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes mystery and a challenge.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game was easy but I loved it anyway! This game will go places if the developer adds more levels that are more challenging.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is in my opinion Pixar's 2nd best film after Up. And that's saying something because after all most of Pixar's films are masterpieces! Pixar's movies are so much more than just children's films. A lot of young children might actually find themselves bored by this movie. But it's such a beautiful movie with a lot of great messages about life.<br /><br />A Must-See!

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has crafted a voyage to the heart of our childhoods, written for adults who glimpse the past. It is shining and magic without a single touch or hint of wrong footed grown up sentimentality. The storyteller has grown and has returned to the sites of his childhood. More important he attempts to weave his seven year old world for us to glimpse.<br /><br />This is magical mystery at its best. After all, &#34; you have a gateway inside you to lands beyond the world you know. They call you as you grow. There can never be a time..when you are not questing after something else.&#34; I have read that longing in any number of ways, but for me, this is the closest to my reality. The writing is replete with these lovely vignettes of insight.<br /><br />After his seventh birthday party, which no one attends, he has set out on his own daytime rambles to find his own world. Our storyteller and Lettie meet after an opal miner kills himself in her yard. She takes him to visit the ocean in her lake. Her mother and grandmother fold him into their world,  and our narrator finds himself in safety.  An adventure meant in all good intention ends with a hole in the world which becomes the impetus for the plot. His family is ensnared by a magic they have failed to catch, and the resolution lies in belief as much as in action.  . Honestly, I wouldn't have minded if the story went on forever just peeking under things we think we know and getting to know these children, Gaiman has managed to craft them as part of every reader. If you waited for this book as I did, it was worth it. If you are new to Gaiman perhaps we will not see you for a while as you pursue his other work. Yes, I think this book is &#34;that good.&#34; the ending has a special resonance for me, and I think for just about anyone
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|The trailer for this movie is the reason I choose to rent it.  The trailer was the best part of this movie.  Thought with Hawke in the picture it would be much better than it was.
0316223239|4.0|I did like this story.  I found it to be very interesting and well written except for the narrator's baby talk.  I almost put the book down after the first reading because the language the 5 year old was talking in was mostly gibberish.  I have a 5 year old nephew and he speaks perfectly.  This sounded more like a 2 1/2 year old just learning to put sentences together.  That would be fine, except that the 5 year narrator is obviously very intelligent and the language just didn't fit him.  Thankfully, the author abandoned the baby talk for the most part (it does occasionally creep back in), and I continued reading the book.<br /><br />If you can get through the first part of the book, I do recommend it.  It is worth the read.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|Movie had some surprises and some suspense.  Not just uour regular slash movie.  Was surprised  at some of the twists and turns.

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I never have read Jo Nesbo's books before. I thought the story was original and well written and the main character, Harry Hole was very interesting. I will certainly read more of Nesbo's books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a very good game. It words your brain to think hard. It puzzles but makes sense at the same  time.
B009RX85N0|2.0|The first season of Once Upon a Time was brillant. I saw the pilot and was immedately hooked. The storyline was good, the acting was good, and the writing was GREAT. Even where it sort of went into soap opera-ishness (mostly with the David Nolan/Mary Margret angst subplot) it was highly entertaining and, at worst, bearable. The show had a framework that was almost dream-like and storybookish but dark enough so that even the little hints of \\"Disney\\" weren't overpowering or cheesy.<br /><br />What I want to know is HOW did they mess up the second season THIS badly? Did they consult with tween Twilight fanfiction writers? Because who else would advise them to come up with the horrible plot gimicks and love triangles that, unlike the ones in the first season, make exactly zero sense?<br /><br />The first couple of episodes weren't bad, though not great, and I had a lot of hope for what they were leading to. I liked some of the new characters they introduced, such as Mulan and Aurora. Aurora in particular was a great character. It just seemed to me like the show already had way too many Katniss-style fight-to-the-death females (Snow White, Ruby, Emma...even Belle to some extent...) and that Mulan was just another one, likable as she was. Whereas in season one, we had such characters as Cinderella and Princess Abigail (neither of whom were big fighters) to sort of keep in mind to any young girls watching that you DON'T have to be able to shoot someone from a mile away -or have endless bravery that spurts out of you like a fountain- to be a good and worthy young lady. Neither of these characters returned for season 2, so Aurora was a delightful replacement. I also liked her with Philip. Until the show booted him off almost before we got to learn diddly squat about his character (at least they let us fall in love with the Sherif's backstory in season one BEFORE they had the queen kill him!)<br /><br />I was delighted that Belle had become a regular on the show. And her story-arc seemed to be going well (making her a librarian, sort of balancing out her feelings for good ol Rumple with the fact that he's still an anti-hero at best), until... This stopped. First they tried to rip off what happened to Juliette in Grimm and take away Belle's memory. Meh, stupid, but workable. I completely lost it when they introduced the \\"Lacey\\" storyline. That was CRUD. Pure, badly-written crud. It made SENSE in season one when after coming out of his coma Prince Charming/David at first had no memory and then got his storybrooke memories back instead of the real one. BECAUSE THE CURSE HADN'T BEEN BROKEN YET! What was the point of Emma breaking the curse, if people could STILL wind up with their curse-time memories only? It's one thing to give characters a complete memory wipe if they cross the town line, but there's no way they should end up the SAME way as they were BEFORE Emma showed up. And, have the writers FORGOTTEN that Belle's curse memories, WOULDN'T be of her playing pool and drinking like a horse? They'd be of her in a bloody hosptial cell, until Jefferson released her. If her \\"returned\\" memory was only of that, and of her going up to Rumple in confusion, not knowing who either of them were, as actually HAPPENED in the first season when she was CURSED, that would have made sense. Even if she called herself Lacey, that would have been okay. It would have made SENSE. And are we supposed to believe that NO ONE in town (all of whom HAVE their fairytale memories back now) EXCEPT Ruby's granny would SAY ANYTHING to Belle about her sudden change in behavior? All Rumple had to do was get ONE person (Mary Margret, David, Emma, ANYONE) to go and tell Belle what happened so she'd know he wasn't making it all up. But, no, he didn't. He just mopes about losing his beloved Belle and trying to make it work with Lacey.<br /><br />And Mr. Gold/Belle used to be my OTP! What the writer's did to them was shameful beyond all reason. And what was the point of makingCora the Miller's daughter? It added nothing to the plot. Am I supposed to believe one spoiled princess (who obviously wasn't ALL bad, since she grew up to be a kind queen and loving mother!) tripping a woman who feels slighted is enough to turn her into an evil witch, who in turn drove her daughter, Regina to become one as well? Why are we supposed to feel sorry for this woman? Little Miss, \\"She tripped me, I hate her, look at me I can spin straw into gold...\\" was very unsympthetic.<br /><br />I wish those were my only complaints about the season, but alas, I'm just warming up.<br /><br />The episode that FINALLY revealed who Henry's father is (though they didn't tell us he was a fairytale character too, until several episodes later) was actually pretty good as a stand-alone plot. Yeah, it doesn't make COMPLETE sense with little hints Emma drops about Henry's father in season one (if anyone remembers, there's even a very subtle hint that Henry's father might have been married to someone else, but it can be taken as just something she meant about guys in general, so I guess the writers decided not to go with that), but that's okay. It was still well-written and entertaining. Then they ruin it by making Neal be Bae from fairytale land. Apparently for no other reason than making Rumple Henry's evil gramps. Whatever. Still okay, UNTIL they brought in the WORST love-triangle in the history of televison love-triangles.<br /><br />Neal/Bae has a pretty, two-faced fiancee who runs his life. Who he never sees do anything wrong, or suspects of double-crossing him or being sneaky in any way, shape, or form. And Emma is secretly jealous. Yawn.<br /><br />Now, this COULD have been workable, IF they had made the fiancee even REMOTELY likable. They made her evil. So that we ALL root for Emma without even the smallest pinch of feeling for this horrible woman. She's cheating on Neal, and wants to destroy storybrook, AND kidnaps Regina only so they can torure her, AND is only withNeal because she (for some reason that's poorly explained) sees his connection to magic and so accidentally-on-purpose bumped into him so they'd meet. All that was left out was a scene with her kicking a puppy or slapping a baby!<br /><br />Her boyfriend was no better. And his character-arc SUCKED. He was, as a little boy, horribly wronged by Regina (in a painfully contrived, badly written way) involving his father's death and now wants revenge. But as he desplays no signs of true compassion toward anyone except his girlfriend and his father's memory, and even a total lack of personality aside from endless determination to find said father, there's no way any viewers can sympathize with ANYTHING he does.<br /><br />Whereas in season one, when they had characters we weren't supposed to root for, they still made them something more than cut-out soap opera embodiments of pure evil! Abigail/Kathryn, for example, stood in the way of Snow White and her prince, and seemed kind of bossy and hard to please in flashbacks, so we thought \\"Hmm, nope, we don't like her,\\" but the show FLESHED HER OUT beautifully! She IS a good person, in her own right, though she doesn't always make the perfect choices. She loved Fredrick and had her own problems. She was actually a GREAT character, part of a love trinagle, but not totally hatable. And we didn't even get to see her and Fredrick reunite when the curse ended! Sadly, her character doesn't even get mentioned in season 2. Instead, our new \\"lady we love to hate\\" is just pure evil inside and out, and even though she loves another guy than the one she's with, we don't care because she doesn't display any redeemable traits that would make us as viewers believe she deserved any happiness in her life.<br /><br />Oh, and I haven't even mentioned HENRY yet. What did they do to you, my boy?! He was such a cool character in season 1. Season 2, has him do a total 180 on us. He still sprouts the same \\"You're the hero\\" stuff as he did before the curse, very unoriginally, I might add, BUT with the odd dash of, \\"We have to save my other mom, too!\\" thrown in there. Yeah, that's right, he now refers to the Evil Queen as \\"still his mom too\\".<br /><br />Are we thinking of the same boy who disliked her so vehmently in season 1 he STOLE a credit card from his teacher and went to freaking BOSTON to find a birth mother he'd never met on the off chance that his story book might be true and he could save everyone and get AWAY from the evil queen?<br /><br />The show tries to make this \\"understandable\\" by adding a plot about Regina trying to change for Henry (I won't even get INTO the fact that she changes her mind almost right away when her own mommy dearest shows up in storybrooke), but he ALREADY starts \\"My mom\\"ing about the queen BEFORE this is introduced. Bad writing, people, bad writing!<br /><br />The only REALLY good episode (as in as good as season 1) in this season was the one were Ruby turns into a werewolf in storybrook and Prince Charming's father steals her red cloak and makes it look like she's killing people when she's not. THAT WAS AWESOME. And well written. Why couldn't the rest of the season have been as good?<br /><br />The saddest part is, aside from the bad storybrooke scenes, all of which (with the exception of Ruby's episode) suck this season, they show actually DID have some good fairy-tale flashback moments. Sadly, these are over-shadowed by a bad over-reaching plot and a laziness that seems like the writers suddenly decided, \\"I wish we'd written a Harry Potter knockoff instead, it's easier than coming up with our own fantasy plot, so let's kind of try and lean in that direction this season, yes?\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I WON'T be ordering this dvd. I'll stick to season one, thanks.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love it works real meat , I highly recommended it really works and maybe  even better than any other cam connectors
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Probably enough praise has been given to this movie and it seems like it always will get praise. So let me just talk about this release in general. This contains some deleted scenes that were present in the laserdisc version but were absent in the 2003 platinum edition DVD release (although ironically that DVD does contain some deleted scenes that were also present in the laserdisc version but not included in this release), an updated commentary, two documentaries for the die hard fans, bloopers showing (or rather listening) the actors mess up their lines but are actually animated to reflect it (check out here to see what I mean: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-MbzzwFiS0) and a sing-along-mode.<br /><br />For the die hard fans who are wanting to see the original theatrical release in widescreen and on Blu-ray, be prepared (no pun intended) to be sorely disappointed to see the 2002 IMAX re-release version being presented. The closest thing the die hard fans will get the original theatrical release will be on the laserdisc version. But trust me when I say that even die hard fans will be happy with this Blu-ray movie.<br /><br />So what are you doing, go buy it now!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is all together a wonderful book.. I would recommend it to anyone that asked about it makes u believe that anything is possible..
