0345803493|5.0|It took me about a week to read all 3 books and now I am regretting reading them so fast! I think I might re-read them just because I know there is probably a lot of detail I missed but I love this trilogy! I only started reading it out of curiosity and am really glad I did!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is so perfect. Just I read this with my sisters an  it was perfect we all agree. We both wanted to cry and we did a little. But how she hated the ending of AIA I hated the end of The Fault In Our Stars. Just because it was perfect. It was bad but it  not hoe I wanted it to end. I never read but I read this in 2 days. Like you can't put It down. But anyways this book  is something yoU must read.
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was in Middle School. I discovered it on a shelf in the Library(this was during a time when I was just getting in to Fantasy) and decided to give it a try. From page one I was drawn in to a lush and dangerous world that intrigued me to no end. I got caught up not only in Sabriel's internal struggles, but all the characters presented in the story. I think what makes people love this book so much is how real it is, despite the fantasy aspect of it. Sabriel is not your usual heroine. She is a tough, kicks ass, and takes no s*** from anyone. But she also have a vulnerable aspect to her that makes her enduring. Nix also brings in an unusual element by introducing bells as a way to control the dead. He takes the subject of necromancy and makes it his own by giving it his own twist. All in all this is an amazing, thoughtful, and original story filled with intrigue, magic, enduring qualities. I highly recommend and I can not wait to go pick up this novel again for the 100th read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks because I have a survival world &amp; I have 2 houses 1is multilevel &amp; the other is 1 level I have a lether cap &amp; boots

B00005N5S2|5.0|A wonderful film... which is why I bought it and to share with a distant relative of the great General, my dear Lady, Ms Martha Deanne Brown Ledford Amsler, who has shown tolerance for the colored people of the world.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the app. Love the mpoints where I can donate to charities or enter to win items. It's always been accurate on what's going on.
B005L38QK2|5.0|I love using this mouse. It is one of the best gaming mouse I have ever used. Well done SteelSeries.
B001GZ6QDS|3.0|I love this movie and found it for a great price. I received the product sooner than expected so that was great but the seller failed to disclose that the back of the DVD case had been damaged. It was not a big deal but I did not like how the damage was not disclosed. Withholding information is still dishonest. I guess you get what you pay for. I will not buy from this seller again.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|The best thing about this book is the reminder it gives all of us that we shouldn't hesitate to go after what we want or feel guilty about it. it does this in a way that's easy to read and drawn from an extensive breadth of research. If what you want to do is be a stay-at-home mom though, don't be fooled - this book is for you too. No matter whether you're male or female, stay-at-home or pursuing a corporate career, it's a book worth reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Makes me go BANANAS! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY. It was a great idea and a specially the new bad guy! THE ULTEMATE GAME FOR DISPICABLE ME FANS!

0345529057|5.0|I absolutely love this book series. I watched Game of Thrones but since season four will not come up until April next year, I decided I would give these books a try. It was a great decision. Since I've started reading A Game Of Thrones, I have found myself thrilled with excitement and I would not drop the book for a second.<br />Even if you're not a bookworm or are a little bit worried about the length of the books, I highly recommend you to try, you will love them.<br /><br />The books themselves, as in the physical copy are a bit of low quality as is expected from a mass-market paperback. The print is a bit small, however if you do not suffer from shortness of sight, like I am, you will feel hardly any discomfort, as you will submerge in the words and story itself. You do need to be careful while handling these books as they seem very fragile.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy about the product and how cheap it was. Do give it a try.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book series is one of the best I have read in a long time! You won't be disappointed! Keep an open mind about the BDSM.
B00BOX0K0M|1.0|The filter is a great design but absolutely not built to withstand everyday use. I took mine on a nine day vacation and by the fifth day the polarizing film had separated from the plastic. I ended up cutting the film down so it would fit inside the gopro housing. I emailed polarpro and they were very quick to respond and offer to mail me another at no cost. Their customer service is awesome but the product needs some work.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent book!!!!  Great read!!! may I know that it is a fifty shades of gray copycat, but it was still a great read.<br />Loved the books.  Waiting for the next one.
0385349947|5.0|This book is right on.  She ackowledges that the book is for women interested in dominating their field.  If that's you, buy this book.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I will admit, I had my doubts about another \\"Superman\\" movie.  Since the 2006 release of \\"Superman Returns\\", I was down on Superman.  I had trouble seeing how his story can make a comeback.  Marvel was taking all the fame and glory with \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Hulk\\", \\"Thor\\", \\"Captain America\\", and ultimately, \\"The Avengers\\".  Not to mention that the \\"Dark Knight Trilogy\\" had taken Batman's story to a whole new level.  I was worried that there was no room left or even a but least of chance for Man of Steel hero.  I really did, at first, believe that \\"Man of Steel\\" was going to fail.<br /><br />But then I saw the movie in theaters and I was completely corrected by the amazingness of \\"Man of Steel!  I was surprised that I actually started loving this movie when it first began!  The story, the acting, and the suspense had me looking on to see what happens next!  For once in my life, I was shocked and excited for this movie.<br /><br />When I found out that the legendary, \\"Christopher Nolan\\" had written the story for the film, I was freaking out of my mind!  I knew that I recognized the beautiful development of the world and of the storyline as well.  Christopher Nolan was (and still is) my inspiration.  Since his work on the \\"Dark Knight Trilogy\\", I have used him as an inspiration.  And then we even have Zach Synder directing the movie too.  I love his work on \\"300\\" and \\"Legend of the Guardians\\"!<br /><br />We also have great actors who helped bring their characters to life.  Like Henry Cavill, who did an amazing job at portraying Superman and actually making us feel for him.  A man who is trying to discover who he is and where his place is in this world, while trying to stay hidden from a world that fears him.  Amy Adams's Lois Lane was one of the greatest acting characters I have ever seen!  She completely allowed us to see a \\"real\\" Lois inside of her and also bring out something new as well.  And we also have the legendary Russell Crowe, who finally brings us a \\"badass\\" Jor-El.Russell allows us to see Mr. El in action and also allows us to actually like him and bring out a whole new personality of him too.  But then we have the villain, Zod!  Michael Shannon brings out his \\"soldier\\" acting and transforms it into something amazing with one of the greatest foes that Superman has ever faced!  We see his evilness and also his will to do what is necessary for the greater good.  He is what a good soldier really is about and Michael brings it to life for the first time.  Both Martha and Jonathan Kent are played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, who make everything about them from the comics come to life and show us how they really would be in a movie like this.  And finally, we have Laurence Fishburne, who gives us perhaps the greatest acting as Perry White since the original Superman films.  Not only do we see a familiar Perry White, but we also get to see a little bit of \\"Morpheus\\" inside his character.  Trust me when I say it, the acting is just amazing from every single actor and the people who chose them did very good!<br /><br />The storyline of this movie was beautiful and it was so Christopher Nolan-style!  Everything was great in depth of every character, including moments as well.  Despite the lack of character-development, the story of this movie was amazing and it brought back Superman from the grave!  Christopher Nolan understands the world of these superheroes!<br /><br />This is a movie that is totally worth buying!
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|It held up well and for the price is hard to beat.  It does slip off of the phone easier than I hoped.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I almost never win but I keep trying. I like the challenges. It seems set for the computer to cause you to make the wrong move, but it's like I am to anxious for the next move so that's where I go wrong.
0316223239|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Written from the perspective of a five year old, I was blown away by the life  they were living.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Loved this book and love Keith. What an interesting man who has led a fascinating life. Brutally candid at times, especially when talking about his love/hate relationship with Mick Jagger. This book rekindled (pardon the pun) my Interest in early Rolling Stones music plus I learned a lot about rock and roll history.  Definitely worth the read.
B0007LGCA4|5.0|nice waterproof sandal, used several times in water so far, seems to be holding up as expected.<br />toe cap nice feature. normally wear size 10, these fit perfect. heavier than expected<br />I would order these again.
1451626088|5.0|I love all the cousins' war books, but I have to say this one is my favorite. It starts out in the aftermath of Richard III's death when Elizabeth of York is still reeling from grief. The tone of the writing in the first part of the book conveys so well the sense of total numbness Elizabeth experiences, as she faces the loss of the love of her life simultaneously knowing she is technically betrothed to Henry Tudor, Richard's enemy. And the man's paranoid with mother issues! And his mother is nuts...Elizabeth of York seemed to spend her life on a tightrope, yet she manages to manage. I think the woman should be sainted.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|Seeing as August Burns Red has been around for ten years now, they have earned the right to throw down the gauntlet. Their guitarist, JB Brubaker stated \\"Metalcore is not an interesting genre at this point. It's very repetitive and predictable; I want more than breakdowns and pop choruses these days.\\"<br /><br />They are from Pennsylvania, America and have released `Thrill Seeker' (2005), `Messengers' (2007), `Constellations' (2009) and `Leveler' (2011), before taking a side-step with the seasonal `Sleddin' Hill, A Holiday Album' (2012). Their latest offering is `Rescue & Restore' (2013). \\"At the end of the day we are still a very heavy band,\\" Brubaker says. \\"Rescue & Restore still has plenty of really heavy stuff, techy odd meter riffs, and all the stuff that people have come to expect from us, it just has a lot more surprises along the way.\\"<br /><br />Opening with the crushing `Provision' with its technical riffing, it tells the story of a man who was taken advantage of, but tries to stay positive. \\"You've given me this nightmare to wake me up / You say, \\"Take pride in the provision\\" / You've given me more than enough / You say, \\"Take pride in the provision\\". They take off again with Jake Luhrs intense screams and growls in `Treatment'. Early on there is a classical interlude with acoustic guitars and violin before ramping up the tension.<br /><br />Whilst bassist Dustin Davidson and Jake Luhrs trade vocals in `Spirit Breaker' it starts to dawn upon you that the traditional verse-chorus song structure has been thrown out the window. And that's when they hit you with a spoken word section with Jake reading out a letter. It takes the standpoint of a dark and depressing time, but holding onto the faint glimmer that there is light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />Another surprise comes in the jaw-dropping `Creative Captivity' which is mainly instrumental and features violin, cello, marimba, Chinese harp, bongos and finishes with a trumpet solo. After that shock to the system, they restore the balance with `Fault Line' which sounds like a throwback to an earlier timeline and will please longstanding fans.<br /><br />They start off full-throttle for `Beauty In Tragedy' before deliberately slowing for another spoken section. \\"Tomorrow, the air will be a little colder / But I'll be sure to breathe for the both of us / And the nights may be a little darker / But I'll be sure to carry the torch to warm the hearts / That never got to feel yours\\". Then its back to throat-tearing intensity as Jake declares his desire to be reunited in the afterlife.<br /><br />There are plenty more twists and turns before the end of the album. Whilst you can find piano, cello, violin and trumpet within it, they still have ample guitar lines and blastbeats. And after the unfortunate implosion of As I Lay Dying, they may be about to become the new saviours of metalcore.o the system, they restore the balance with `Fault Line' which sounds like a throwback to an earlier timeline and will please longstanding fans.<br /><br />They start off full-throttle for `Beauty In Tragedy' before deliberately slowing for another spoken section. \\"Tomorrow, the air will be a little colder / But I'll be sure to breathe for the both of us / And the nights may be a little darker / But I'll be sure to carry the torch to warm the hearts / That never got to feel yours\\".

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so realistic! The journal has very easy-to-follow instructions and the stable hand is very helpful. The actions of the horses in the game are just like those of real horses.
0064471837|5.0|I would recommend either the books or the audiobooks to anyone. I came across these books by chance when someone donated \\"Sabriel\\" to my high school library. It was so unlike anything else that the small library carried, and I snatched it up instantly. It was the first fantasy book I'd ever read except for Tolkein and Rowling. I was immediately swept away by Nix's Old and New Kingdoms, and the people and creatures of both worlds.<br /><br />I was blown away by the magic system, which was nothing like I'd seen before. I believe I read it twice before returning it to the library, and was determined to buy my own copy.<br /><br />A few years later, I was walking through a bookstore and happened across the next two books in the trilogy. I purchased the whole set and devoured them all over the weekend. I read the books over and over, and when I found them on Audible I purchased them again. Now I alternate listening to the wonderful Tim Curry perform the audio and reading them myself. I've recommended them to a large number of friends and relatives, who always enjoy them immensely.<br /><br />Thanks Garth Nix, for making awesome stories with awesome heroines who aren't stereotypical in any form. Sabriel and Lirael are some of the best female characters I've read in fantasy, a genre that often marginalizes women characters or turns them into tropes like the \\"Damsel in Distress\\" or the (seemingly) most popular paranormal romance trope \\"Badass no-nonsense no-faults lady with a soft heart when it comes to vampires/werewolves/ghosts/poltergiests.\\" Instead, Sabriel and Lirael (and even side characters like Sanar and Ryelle) are strong characters with believable strengths and weaknesses that end up shining under pressure. Sabriel shows the inner strength and determination that I value so much, while the main character of the sequel, Lirael, captures the heart of how lonely we can be as adolescents that don't fit in and the changes that take place when they find strength in who they are instead of who they wish they were.<br /><br />All in all, the whole world should read these books. They are some of my very favorite.hey are instead of who they wish they were.<br /><br />All in all, the whole world should read these books. They are some of my very favorite.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel drew me in from the first page. Years later this book still hasn't let me out. On the cover, it is the story of a young woman in search of her father and burdened by the responsibility of laying the Dead to rest. Before you start to think that this is just another derivative Undead Teen Fantasy, I should point out that Sabriel predates the books of the zombie/vampire popularity wave by a decade. In terms of quality and originality it surpasses them by far more than that. Sabriel is nothing if not original. But the thing which really raises this book from the level of decent fantasy thriller to masterpiece is its depth. In the Old Kingdom, Garth Nix created a world so real that even after reading the whole series, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what there is to learn. The magic systems are fascinating. The characters are unforgettable. The writing is hauntingly vivid, with every detail adding to the sense of mystery and wonder. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Awesome book read it<br /><br />Minecraft<br />Carnival  and dad  the sea of blessings and nonsense and dad was gone to the sea of nonsense

B00COCY67A|4.0|Is this great? No.  Is it previously unreleased material? No.  Is it worth having? Yes.  And here's why: It's all the Stax recordings in one place, the booklet that comes with it presents some fantastic pictures including one of Elvis' Stutz (the white one) parked at the studio during the December session, as well as some cool karate photos.  There IS some good stuff here. It was Elvis in Memphis in 1973, driving to the studio and giving us something to listen to forty years later. Do him a favor and get it.
0060919760|4.0|It's good but remember books cannot talk back at you so you might tend to avoid reading what really hurts so going to a therapist is always better.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|I saw this movie while it was in the theatres and I really did enjoy it.  I really like Eddie Murphy in movies for he is always so funny and makes the movie that more enjoyable.  The title of this movie is very interesting for what would you do if you only had a thousand words to talk to a family member or an acquaintance.  Makes you stop and think about it doesn't it.  The movie is really one that should be added to anyone's collection especially if you like Eddie Murphy

B000H7JD90|5.0|The first record they sent me skipped on just about every track.  I reported it on a friday and asked for UPS to come pick it up rather than take it myself to the UPS store.  They showed up on Monday to pick it up and I received my new record on Tuesday all at no extra cost to me.
0345803485|1.0|The grammar is pretty awful in this book.  I couldn't even finish it. The isn't even good.  It's quite overrated.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was challenging without being discouraging. I can't wait for more rooms to be added. Keep up the good work
0064471837|5.0|My favorite genre is fantasy, and I am quite fussy I must say, it takes quite a bit for me to fall in love with a book. Sabriel is one of my favorite books of all time (along with the other books in the series.<br />It has everything I always look for in a good book, and I found the characters in particular Sabriel easy to fall in love with. there is so much drama and so many layers that I immediately related to characters.<br /><br />I love the way the book also takes the two worlds of fantasy (over the wall) and real life (behind the wall).<br /><br />This really is an amazing book, and no matter how many times I read it, I am captivated every time.
B008CFN95I|4.0|I found this an enjoyable tale.  Well written and interesting characters. The right amount of twists and turns and a great message at the end
B00000634J|5.0|It has all of Lennon's best tracks (except for Hey Jude, which I hate) but otherwise a good anthology  at a decent price
B008ROEU1Q|5.0|This is one of my new all time favorite movies. I've seen it three times now,and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it. This is an unbelievable journey........funny, sad, deep and truly inspiring. The story of an American Jew of Ukranian Descent on a journey to locate his immigrant grandfather's roots before and during WWII. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.....(and I would recommend the book by Jonathan Safran Foer as well).

B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Loved the movie. As soon as I saw I went home and told my parents that as soon as the movie came out we were buying it. LOVE THIS MOVIE
0064471837|5.0|Hi all,<br />So, you're planning on buying a book. I strongly suggest that you make this a purchase of yours.  I read the book about two years ago, and the whole series is still entirely embedded in my memory. There isnt a single person that i wouldnt recommend this book to.<br />Right from the get go, it's packed to the hilt with magic and mystery, and there isnt a dull moment in this book at all. With most books i struggle to keep reading, whereas with Sabriel, it was the exact opposite. I could'nt seem to put the book down!<br />Top and bottom of it is, this book is fantastic.. Press the little button that says you want to buy it.. Go on..<br />Thanks for reading folks.<br />I'm OldKingdomMage
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was by far the best book I have ever read. John Green develops the characters to the point that they seem real. You gain a strong connection with each character, and you don't wamt to stop reading.(i was up until 2 am reading this) For anyone who plans on reading &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34;, be prepared, i have only cried twice while reading a book before this, and i was practically balling my eyes out at the end. I hope you enjoy, because it really is a great book!
B007Z9RS22|5.0|This movie is surprisingly underrated.  Its well written, Charlene and Keaunu are perfect in the role.  Even my better half liked it.  I am not usually a fan of romantic movies, hardly ever watch them but this one was worth it. Highly recommend.
0345529057|5.0|I watch the first two seasons of Game of Thrones on HBO and feel in love with the world that George RR Martin created, finally I had time to read during the summer and I quickly devoured these books. The show gives faces and voices to the characters, while the books expand the universe to complete the tale in a way that the show never can. They are easy to read because the structure and language that Martin uses is far superior to most fantasy writers.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|The wonderful animated stories of Hayao Miyazaki have long been favorites at Grandma's and [[ASIN:B00BEYYEIK Howl's Moving Castle]], Miyazaki's interpretation of Diana Wynne Jones story of the same name is no exception.  When my granddaughter moved to the UK a couple of years ago the Miyazaki collction went with her, so I was delighted to have the print version pop up on my recommendations a few weeks ago and I couldn't wait to read it.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones was a prolific British author.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|Very useful and easy to use. It is easy to navigate and find what you want. I enjoy using this app because it allows me to keep track of weather conditions anywhere me or my family travels.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|Pat Metheny did this work in simply an intro and 3 parts. Of the whole, I liked part one the best. Not my favorite CD of his but I'm sure I'll give it a few more listens.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game sure it's not as good as pc or Xbox but I can play it anywhere on my kindle and it costs less
B0034G4P94|5.0|Great action, drama, story and casting. Nick Nolte gave an Oscar winning performance as the abusive father you were rooting for by the end of the movie. Not just a fight flick, a good flick
B001B6PBBK|5.0|This movie was a surprise in that I really enjoyed it.  Although a bit predictable like most romantic comedies,  the movie had substance and was very sweet.  I'm very sad Brittany won't be cast in new movies,  as she's always so beautiful to watch both inside and out.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Story telling along with puzzle solving. The puzzle are just right as far as difficulty goes.  I have already gotten a couple of friends playing.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|So much fun and a great way to give your brain a great work out. I love finding hidden objects, and this adds a little mystery and thriller along with it. Great game!
B00280LYIC|4.0|I like how they use many Greek myths during the story. I also liked how they said how many great historical figures were Half-bloods
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a great on the go game. The only flaw to it to me are the fact that this is the most least updated platform. I'll play on the go but when I'm home I prefer the the PC best so I would have to rate this app 4 for the fact it's so ADDICTIVE and one of the best simulation games I played. SO I overall say get it for kids but its not the best suggested platform.  :)
1451627297|3.0|I was interested in reading this book.  After all I was there.<br /><br />Not in Dealey Plaza, but on the parade route.  My mother took me and my sister out of school to see it.  Along with my best friend we went down to a position on the parade route to see the President and the First Lady go by.  By the time we had arrived at Goff's for lunch, he was lying in Parkland hospital.<br /><br />When King wrote this book he had someone to slip him details to build up the verisimilitude of the book.  He could have picked a better expert.  At one point he says that you could smell the refineries located in the Permian Basin.  Dallas and Odessa are hundreds of miles apart, guy!  Can you smell the money printed in Washington from Maine?  This is just as silly. At another point the protagonist has a car wreck at an intersection near Parkland hospital.  These two streets cross each other but they don't have an intersection but an overpass.  After this the other driver starts running westward and the hero tells him not to stop \\"until you reach Love Field\\".  That airport is to the east of that intersection.  The guy would have had to circumnavigate the world before getting to Love Field.<br /><br />This may sound like nit picking.  And perhaps this is.  But Stephen King built up his reputation on creating believable characters.  And the setting of the story is just as important.  He should stick to writing stories set in Maine.  Or at least do a little research.  If he expects people to spend their hard-earned money then he owes them that much.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a good story.  Just not as good as many others he has penned.

B00CM9JKQM|3.0|Throughout rock history there have been many groups who have undergone personnel changes. While Queensryche has had a revolving door in their lead guitar department, this effort marks the first time they have chosen to utilize a new vocalist. Previous groups who have successfully been able to amend the voice of their band include Van Halen and Black Sabbath. However, in such cases it should be noted that those singers had highly successful careers before joining these groups and brought a large fan base with them when they joined (Sammy Hagar solo and with Montrose, Ronnie James Dio with Rainbow). Groups such as Journey and Styx have not experienced such great success when replacing their singers and undergo such stigmas as being labeled a karaoke band. New Queensryche singer, Todd La Torre brings with him no measurable fan base and now faces such a dilemma.<br />Their first effort on the self-titled disc begins with the instrumental track X2, which is far less a musical endeavor and more reminiscent of a soundtrack that you would expect to hear in a movie or video game. Although this is not atypical for Queensryche, knowing fan expectations it comes off as being quite contrived. \\"Where Dreams go to Die\\" marks the single contribution from added guitarist Parker Lundgren on this release and marks the debut of new vocalist La Torre. While the song starts out as an aggressive metal song, it quickly transforms itself with a smoky lounge type verse and an over the top cliché chorus with the singer promising the listener \\"I will take you there.\\"<br />If there is any track on this disc that is remotely reminiscent of the early Queensryche sound it is found in the track \\"Spore.\\" Rockenfield in particular shines on this endeavor. Subsequent offerings such as \\"In This Light\\" and \\"Vindication\\" would lend themselves better to being labeled as Iron Maiden songs then to suggest that it sounds like classic Queensryche. Redemption, although a very fine track, has the vocals sounding quite processed throughout the choruses (autotuned?) and La Torre seems to be straining his upper register in an effort to make it work. \\"Midnight Lullaby\\" is another brief interlude used as an introduction to \\"A World Without\\" which is not only unnecessary, but continues to show a calculated move on the part of the group (or the producer) who are trying to make it sound like former Queensryche releases in their attempt to appease their die-hard fan base. \\"Don't Look Back\\" and \\"Fallout\\" are two rocking songs that will surely get some fans pumping their fists in the air but at times comes off as sounding a little too commercialized for hard-core metal fans looking to find that vintage Queensryche sound.  The offering of newly recorded originals concludes with \\"Open Road,\\" in typical fashion of the way that all Queensryche albums end - a slow song.<br />While this \\"new Queensryche\\" album is a very solid effort, and I find it quite enjoyable, it does not sound like any Queensryche we've ever heard before. Michael Wilton will always sound like Michael Wilton whether or not he plays on a Queensryche album or some other album.  Jackson, who I find as being one of the top bass players of the whole metal genre will always shine but continue to be under rated and underestimated. Of course Rockenfield is always a good drummer that can lay down a solid effort; however being a rhythmical instrument and not a musical instrument, it does not impact the overall sound/vibe of the music. That being said, because one individual or a group of individuals playing is recognizable does not make it any more Queensryche sounding then something as simple as hearing the voice from their former singer. Had the disc not concluded with a live recording of three classic Queensryche songs, which is a good thing, one might not know who they were supposed to be listening to.<br />All in all it is a very good album; just not a Queensryche Album. Under another moniker I could have given it four stars. Under the brand of Queensryche and comparing it to their earliest works, I have to stretch in order to give it three. Nothing on this disc sounds anything like: the EP, The Warning , or Rage For Order (Queensryche in general).
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best apps/games in the app store. If you have never bought any minecraft game I would recommend this app to you and the great thing about this app is that it is cheap compared to computer version and xbox version. It is really fun to play I probably play this game the most out of any other app. If you get the money to buy it and have never bought it DO IT!
140006922X|1.0|There are so many good, honest, helpful books that it is a shame so much money and time would be wasted on inaccurate (which I think is a generous description) work such as this. For the publisher, this is a great book (lots of money coming their way); for the reading public, it's a lot of recyclable paper.<br /><br />I don't know anything about a Fox News interview, but I did hear the author on Public Radio, and he spoke so many errors and just plain foolishness.  I can't understand the hype around this book that should have quietly melted into oblivion.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I think this game is fun for a MLP fan. the artwork is nice, the voices of the ponies seem authentic, and the minigames are interesting. I disagree with the gem shortage complaints on other reviews. there are 5 ways to earn gems without dropping cash. 1) daily login bonus, 2) killing parasprites, 3) killing pony clones, 3) finding derpy, 4) using friendship hearts to play flim and flam's balloon pop, 5) completing some quests. like most of these free games, the progression is slower without spending real money.<br /><br />with all that said, this game has some real problems. all of your game data is stored locally. that means if you reinstall or change devices, you will lose all progress. the friend system is buggy on some platforms disallowing you to 'visit' friends. this is a problem since it is one of the ways to get friendship hearts. it is also too easy to spend gems unintentionally. I experienced some lag and double tapped the screen and was suddenly 20 gems lighter. luckily they refunded it.<br /><br />I have obtained the main 5 ponies without dropping any cash, and granted, I may never get enough to buy Celestial, but the game is free.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is a very interesting look at the first century situation in Palestine, the world that Jesus lived in. Mr. Aslan makes the case that Jesus was only one of many so-called zealots, whose stated mission was to liberate the Jews from the rule of the Roman Empire and the corrupt priesthood, who were collaborating with the ruling officials to enrich themselves.<br />This is not a new idea, as I have read several other books which suggested that this was the case. However, Aslan, a Muslim, has approached the subject as an impartial scholar, whose goal is to separate the historical Jesus from the &#34;Christ&#34; , as the Church has portrayed him.<br />The most interesting part of the book for me was the last section, which explored why this messiah, unlike all of the others, did not disappear into obscurity after his death, and indeed, was worshipped and glorified by his followers, who were absolutely convinced that he was resurrected and believed he would return imminently. If Jesus was not risen from the dead, why were they all so sure he was still alive and that, indeed, they had seen him? How could all of them be suffering from a delusion? Could it be that, as Paul so confidently assured them, Jesus was indeed the Son of God? As a Christian, I am convinced that this was the case, even though the historical Jesus, as described by Aslan, did not seem to be aware of it during his lifetime.

0765334798|5.0|When I saw this one I just burst out laughing, who doesn't know what a redshirt is and what happens to them!  After getting the book I fell in love with it as Mr. Scalzi took me through the life and probable death experience of some redshirts in a &#34;Star Trek like&#34; universe.  The primary characters (the redshirts) were outstanding in showing us how &#34;secondary&#34; characters and their actors must feel in a series where they're sacrificed for the plot.  Adding to this is seeing a captain, chief science officer, and doctor that made you chuckle about TV shows main characters and the &#34;decisions&#34; they make that get &#34;secondary&#34; characters killed.  The story is outstanding for anyone who loves Star Trek or other shows where the secondary characters are thrown away and the primary characters do the impossible!  A must read and absolutly fun!!
B0000041DF|5.0|My favourite recording of the Tchaikovsky concerto is the live recording from 1980 with Martha Argerich on the piano and the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Kirill Kondrashin. If you are looking for a pianist to discover and fall in love with, then Martha Argerich would be one of my top recommendations. Her discography is vast, impressive and consistently good. Martha Argerich even has an \\"Amazon Store\\" dedicated to her. She has a reputation for renditions with drive, speed, dynamism and nobility. She has an ease of playing which makes even difficult passages appear effortless. Her live performance of the Tchaikovsky is exciting and gripping, full of risks, and endlessly rewarding.<br /><br />For immediate appeal go straight to the last movement to experience some of the speed, fury and excitement that Martha Argerich is so adept at delivering.

B009LROCJI|5.0|On this CD Vivaldi's Four Seasons is given a 2012 modern treatment and facelift. The movements and timings are almost identical to the original version. This makes the piece instantly familiar, yet still new and different at the same time.<br /><br />Daniel Hope, the violinist on this recording, is a fellow South African, born in Durban. He plays these pieces with crisp precision, excitement and vision. In short, he is incredible in these pieces.<br /><br />The following quote by the composer, Max Richter, aptly summarises my feelings about this work.<br />\\"The piece is pretty radical. I've probably thrown away three quarters of the notes, but I've kept the gestures, shapes, textures and dynamics of Vivaldi\\"-Max Richter.<br /><br />In short, I am truly excited by and in awe of this achievement. This piece demands to be heard.

3836538725|5.0|I have been following Salgado for many years, and definitively this is his best work ever. The book is extremely well done, prints are perfect and his photography as stunning as they can be. Totally worth the money!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|This is a stellar album by Newsted that has crunchy, bluesy, metal riffs that Jason growls his way through.  His vocals are a nice antidote to Hetfield's and there is not a bad song on the album.  Occasionally there is a hint of \\"Justice\\" era Metallica. The most glaring example is on \\"Soldierhead\\" and other moments like on \\"Ampossible\\".  But the album really kicks into gear with songs like \\"As the Crow Flies\\" and \\"Kindevillusion\\".  I highly recommend this album.
034580404X|3.0|I read all three.  It could have been one delightful book.  The sex scenes got quite monotomus.  How many times did we read about him pulling her hair back.  I wanted the whole thing to be Anastasia's fantasy

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a well written and gripping novel. It is set in two countries, the Old Kingdom where magic is present, and Ancelstierre, which is similar to our modern world. It follows the journey of Sabriel, living at a boarding school in Ancelstierre and her mission to find her father, the Abhorsen. The relationships between Sabriel, Touchstone and Mogget were thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining, despite the dark nature of the book.

B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Let me break it down for you:<br /><br />There were parts of this that made me confused and uncomfortable:<br />-Abby was totally cool with Travis's crazy obsessive behavior<br />-Abby accepted a DIAMOND TENNIS BRACELET from a boy she had only been dating for a grand total of 5 days. What?!<br />-Abby is as one dimensional and bland as a blank piece of paper.<br />-Abby is sleeping in the same bed as a man who likes her but she doesn't like him back but secretly she does so thats why she sleeps with him but not actually sleeps with him... do you see how convoluted this story line is?!<br />-the point is, she was dating one guy while sleeping in the same bad as another.<br />-EVERYTHING is handled so casually that I started to worry that I wasn't reading correctly.<br />-Travis is one of the most persistent male stereotypes that I've ever come across.<br />-Like, I could literally smell the testosterone coming off the pages.<br /><br />While reading this book, I noted some other things:<br />-I could literally see the storyline deteriorating<br />-There was little to none details<br />-I kept checking the book progress percentage on my Kindle, hoping it was close to over. I kid you not.<br /><br />All in all, I only read to about 42%.

140006922X|1.0|Listened to the book, the comments below explain the book better than I have heard anywhere else.    Zealot recently received a publicity boost from an awkward interview, which Joe Carter analyzes here. (But amidst the hub-bub about the interview, which focused on why a Muslim would write a book on Jesus, Joe wonders why people aren't snickering at Dr. Aslan himself, who seems to be more of an amateur historian--with no teaching experience on, or peer-reviewed academic articles about, historical Jesus research--who is implying that he is an expert in the field. As Alan Jacobs notes, \\"Reza Aslan's book is an educated amateur's summary and synthesis of a particularly skeptical but quite long-established line of New Testament scholarship, presented to us as simple fact. If you like that kind of thing, Zealot will be the kind of thing you like.\\")    Ross Douthat has a good post on the book, and Mike Bird will be reviewing the book for TGC.    The Good Book Company Blog also has a review by Gary Manning Jr., associate professor of New Testament at Biola University's Talbot School of Theology.    Here's the conclusion:      Finally, despite his generally good understanding of the field, Aslan makes a number of significant errors. I took pages of notes just on historical and linguistic errors in Zealot. Here are only a few examples of significant scholarly errors:      Use of Greek definitions not found in any standard Greek lexicon;    Using the wrong Greek lexicon for the New Testament;    Incorrect definition of the targumim;    Unawareness of the evidence for high literacy in ancient Israel;    Unawareness of literary approaches to the gospels;    Claims that violence against foreigners was the only faithful Jewish response;    Claims that Pilate crucified \\"thousands upon thousands\\" without trial;    Very late, unlikely dates for the writing of the four gospels;    Claims that ancient people did not understand the concept of history;    Claims that Luke was knowingly writing fiction, not history;    Claims that Mark does not describe Jesus' resurrection;    And on and on.      In many cases, I had to come to the conclusion that Aslan was just not familiar enough with modern scholarship related to the New Testament.      There are numerous other problems with Zealot, too numerous to address in an already-too-long blog post. Aslan repeatedly presents highly unlikely interpretations of passages in the New Testament, makes little effort to defend those interpretations, then moves on as if he has made his case. Suffice to say this, as others have said before: there is something a little bizarre about using our only historical documents about Jesus (the New Testament) to come to conclusions quite in opposition to those documents. There is a good reason to believe that Jesus claimed to be a divine king and savior who would die and rise again, and would one day return to judge the world: All four gospels, and indeed the entire New Testament, make this claim. You can deny that this claim is true, but it is scholarly folly to deny that Jesus and the early Christians believed it.    The whole post is here:  [...]
B000W8HC8I|4.0|This book and his lifestyle is beyond comprehension. I can't believe this guy is still alive. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|First let me say I read the books prior to renting this movie... but I am a total sucker for seeing  books turned movies, especially for books i enjoyed.  Let me say this, the movie varries significantly from the books, loosing key character development integral to the next few stories.  Major elements of the book needed for development in later books are skipped or done incorrectly.<br /><br />As for the romance, there is totally something missing from this one and others may disagree, but i just dont get that intense \\"love at first\\" dynamic expected from what the book portrayed.  Perhaps i expected a differnt casting for Ethan...either way, I digress...<br /><br />Bottom line- unlikely that they will complete the sequel, and the moving \\"ENDs\\" in a cliffhanger so watching it in its own right will deffinitely leave you hanging.  Glad i rented this prime style for 3.99 and did not buy it. Giving it two stars though, since i did want to see it so, and because the story garnered from the books is likely jading my view of how the movie turned out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is one of my favorite games on my Kindle Fire because it is so much fun and it never gets boring no matter how many times you play it. I also love that every few weeks the stage of the game changes and you get go to different places all over the world. And you also get to buy a special limited time character that changes with all the different places you go around the world. This app is amazing and so much fun and I would definitely recommend this app to everyone who loves to play fun games.

1451662432|5.0|For some reason I just became interested in Arnolds personal story. I really wanted to get an insight of his mind set. And that's just what he delivered in his book Total Recall. It wasn't that he just didn't give up, he went way beyond that. He succeeded even before he attempted it. If there ever was a roll model for success in our contemporary times, it's Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br />I think I have come away after reading his book a better more self assured and prepared individual. Not some &#34;girly-man. LOL.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|When I saw the previews of this movie coming to the theater, I said &#34;You have got to be kidding me&#34;, so I skipped seeing it on the big screen, and that was one BIG mistake. This is one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen, and the special effects were awesome, and man, I would have loved to have seen it in 3-D. This is now one of my favorite movies, and who knows, maybe I'll get lucky enough and they'll bring it back to the big screen.
B000007O9L|4.0|I'm a drummer and a big Stones fan. \\"Stripped\\" is a good album, but I pay attention to the drums. And Charlie Watts' drumming on these tracks is as lackluster as can be. Less can be more, but in this case, it's simply less. For example: The beat on the original 1968 studio version of \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" is key to the song's identity. However, on \\"Stripped,\\" Watts plays another, generic beat, that -- pardon my pun -- strips the song of much of its identity. Except for their earliest albums, the drums have always been up front in the mix on Stones' songs; that also applies to \\"Stripped,\\" but I only wish I could have heard better drums. Watts is capable of great playing.

0064471837|5.0|I cannot recommend \\"Sabriel\\" and the entire \\"Abhorsen\\" series more highly.<br /><br />I have been reading and re-reading them for over a decade (almost two at this point!), and the books never fail to enchant me, move me, and amaze me.  I won't go into plot details, but if you're reading this I assume you know it's a fantasy tale set between two worlds - one with magic, and one without. There are spells, necromancers, talking cats, and even a few journeys into Death.<br /><br />Yes, there are many other books with those elements, but what they lack is the heart of Sabriel. Garth Nix makes his worlds and characters so vivid and devastatingly human that you can't help but relate to them. You may not encounter magic in your daily life, but Nix will reach you with his intricate use of love, death, passion, family, and sacrifice. To know Sabriel is to know yourself, and find the strength in you to pursue your goals through intangible odds.<br /><br />I loved the story as a \\"kid,\\" but now as an \\"adult\\" I cherish the subtle moments of Sabriel that make the book come to life on the human plane. I encourage you to read it and its sequels - I know you'll find them to be more human and relatable than many stories that are not set in magical worlds. Nix, at the end of the day, is a conjurer of raw emotion. What could be more magical than that?

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|As long as you know that the Chromecast needs Chrome to run and can only watch Netflix, Youtube, or surf the web via Chrome, then this device will work fine for you.<br /><br />A big issue that bummed me out was I thought I could take it on the road and watch Netflix on my hotel TV.  The Chromecast has to be on the same network as the laptop and the Chromecast can't communicate with any hotel router that asks a question for entry such as \\"Do you agree with these terms?\\" or \\"What room are you in?\\"  Chromecast has no provisions for logging into wireless networks therefore it is only useable on home networks. I'm picking up a TPLink mr3040 portable router and will try to get Chromecast to work in the hotel that way but it is getting to be a PITA.<br /><br />As for how Chromecast works at home, it is pretty cool, the kids are starting to use it to watch youtube videos and play music videos from their Android phones.  I like it for browsing the web.<br /><br />This product has huge potential but it is too restricted now... I'd give it a year.

She has played Suzuki violin for over a year and wanted to take those lessons so she could dance around, flipping her long hair, just like the violinist with Celtic Women.  Note:  It does help that she is in a very musical family - her mom is a band director and plays French horn in a couple of semi-professional groups and her dad also plays French horn, is President of an orchestra board and also plays in both professional and semi-professional groups.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's nice to be around &quot;horses&quot; for a change . I love horses! I needed to try the app first though.
B000JBWWRY|3.0|I purchase this because my kids LOVE Peter Pan and it was a missing piece within our Disney movies collection. I was very happy that the price was extremely reasonable $7.99 to be exact for a brand new, unopened DVD set. However, this DVD does not play on 2 of our DVD players. Very disappointing especially since both of them are in our kids room! The DVD will play on our PS3, but that's it. Great product though!
B000XT1P3E|5.0|Ordered the movies to take along RV camping to an area in the mountains that doesn't have TV reception DVD's are a blessing!<br />We placed the order later than we should have, but the order came before we left!  Can not beat the shipping and attention to customer service.<br /><br />Thank you!
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is so easy to use. One thing I really love about this calculator is the big numbers. Being older it is hard to see the small numbers on my cell phone that I use to use. So yes I love this calculator
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm not in to horses much but I got it for my love and she loves them we ride our horses out back so yea I like horses. thanks for the people who understand
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|THEE worst ending I have ever read of all the books I've given my time to. So chances are good that I will no longer be giving my time to anymore Sylvia Day. It seems as though she just rushed through it and gave it no thought.
B001BJNIIK|5.0|Here's what you need to know. Two cops, played by Stallone and Russell, are framed for murder by vengeful drug lords. It's made in the 80's and is the quintessential 80's action flick. It's awesome, with action and cheesiness and amazing performances by the leads, with a villain whose performance is over the top. You have to have a heart of stone not to enjoy this flick.
B00COLCTQ6|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2IHJSDC65OQ2P]]I bought this at retail for 49.99 and after state tax it cost me 52.99. Much cheaper than what is availible through Amazon at the time of this review. Prices do change though.<br />On with the review. This is an awesome Star Wars set. It was a blast to build and only took me about an hour while I watched TV in the back ground. I think a kid would have the same amount of fun and as long as they were old enough should have no problem building it on their own. I as a 'big kid' can say that it is also fun to play with (check out the video to see me doing just that) and it's as durable as all the other Lego sets I have ever bought to handle it. It may not hold up to a younger childs play though quite as well, but Legos can always be put back together. I like all of the mini figs about the same and I think the fact that they included four of them is really great. The mobile cannon is the star of the set though and I think the design is supurb. The legs are totally adjustable and holds the body up with ease. The body consists of two cockpits with one in the front for the pilot and one hidden in the back for the co-pilot. My favorite thing though is the giant gun on it's back. It can be aimed with a very cool lever that sticks out the bottom of the body. The gun has the spring loaded missle launcher that Lego has included in other sets and is fun to shoot things with.<br />Anyway, I say buy it while it's affordable because once it goes out of production the price will sky rocket.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Once you get the hang of the patterns and objects it's not too hard to complete. But it does require you to do a lot of forward thinking rather quick reactions.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I was amazed at how much fun a free game could be. Usually you get one or two levels then you have to either stop or pay. Not this! Thank you for this thoughtfu
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|'I love this game. I am so addicted. I play it everyday. Well worth the money. Get this game. Have fun.
0307949508|5.0|For me this sequel was probably better than the original.  I say this because I found out so much about Salander(main character) that I had been questioning in this book.  It was very suspenseful!
B001EC0OMM|5.0|A Great movie, Hepburn,Stewart and Grant top of the list. Hollywood could use more talent like these 3, real talent, true stars .
B0095H4FAA|4.0|This was definitely a good read.  I thought it moved a little slow for me and repeated itself in details sometimes.  However,I loved the plot with its twist and turns.
0064471837|5.0|If there is one mark of a truly vibrant and captivating story, it is the ability for a book series to entrance the reader and to transport them to the world that it describes, like a second home, time and time again. With the Old Kingdom series, Garth Nix has done exactly that, and with such relatable protagonists that the reader can feel their fear, hope, struggles and triumphs as if living behind their eyes. Reading as a child, a teen, and an adult, the books have not lost their appeal, and the challenges that the characters face are just as gripping now as they were upon first reading them well over a decade ago. Nix weaves a world of magic so perfectly integrated to the modern world, so cleverly composed and described, that the reader might not wholly be surprised to encounter \\"The Perimeter\\" some day in his/her travels.<br />These are books which I continue to re-read, and have also shared with many friends over the years - even reading aloud - and I simply can't recommend these books highly enough! Where other fantasy series have come and gone, the Abhorsen trilogy has secured a permanent spot on the bookshelf.<br /><br />As an addendum, for those with busy schedules and a long commute, the audiobooks are also very capably handled by none other than renowned actor Tim Curry. You will not be disappointed.
0553062182|4.0|Has some great points and also some things I just took with a grain of salt. However, overall its a good read and informative. I would recommend it for sure!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, exiting, interesting, and entertaining. I don't think I've played a game so much before. The new upgrade I just got is funer, and incorporates the second movie.
B00005UWMX|1.0|The DVD did not work.  Need better explanation of what (Region 2) means. It means it will now work in the United States.  It was a great price, but will not work.  It will cost me more to return it that what I paid for the DVD.  Vendor who provided the DVD said that it only has &#34;region 2&#34; DVD's and that we should of known that it would not work in the United States.  POOR NOTIFICATION THAT THE DVD WORKS ONLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.  Will never buy anything from them again.  MAKE NOTE THAT REGION 2 WILL NOT WORK IN THE UNITED STATES.  I don't think I am the only one who did not know that.  It should be spelled out in another way other that Region 2 next to the title.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The more you play it the better you get at first you might not like it because it's hard but keep playing it and it will end up to be really fun
B005LAII12|2.0|It would have been a lot more funny without all the F bombs, etc.  While some strong language is expected, this was over the top
B007VUCAVO|5.0|If you support this app you are being good.  It is a great app.  Calibrate the app and see.  The app does what it says.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|It was such a good movie. I kept looking for it on DVD in store but they only had blu-ray. I found it on here for like $5...go me!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I think the creators of this app did an amazing job is really fun and the graphics are awesome best app I have ever played
0064471837|5.0|This book is amazing. I found it in high school, and couldn't put it, or the sequels, down. I recommended it to friends and we've all delighted in Garth Nix's detailed and believable world.<br /><br />One of the things that I really like about this book are the characters. They have flaws, they have dreams and goals, and they react how one would think some one would react to the troubles they face.  Sabriel isn't a super tough, can do everything heroine. She does what she needs to do, but not without fear, confusion, and making decisions that really weren't the best, like a real person.<br /><br />  Also, I don't find myself rooting for the antagonist. You want the heroes to succeed, and the villains to be brought low. It's refreshing not to have the villains be more interesting than the protagonist.<br /><br />This book got me through some tough times, so I'm really glad I picked it up. The only problem I have is that I want Garth Nix to write more and more.  Anyway, I highly recommend this book. I don't think you'll regret it.
B003UYV08E|5.0|just watched  it is great and this movie just get better and better cant wait till number 3 just loved it

B005LAII4E|1.0|Very bad. Even coming in expecting cheesy action & bad writing, this was even worst than that.<br /><br />The Rock couldn't save this movie if he tried.<br />There is barely any action in this movie.<br />Ninja fights are filmed in the worst possible way.<br />I don't know who they hired for that, but soooo bad.<br /><br />The female actess Jaye was the only good thing in this movie really. Very pretty<br /><br />Bruce Willis, barely in it. same goes for Cobra Commander.<br /><br />This was a downgrade from the original & even both of those are not on the same level as the 80s animated movie.<br />go see that. its better x1000000000000
B0034G4P80|5.0|I have always loved thor and I would love to see more of thor movies they are the best keep them comming

386521584X|3.0|Robert Frank is an amazing photographer, I've seen a selection of his work since I began photographing over 10 years ago. The reason I'm giving &#34;The Americans&#34; a 3 star review is because I expected a lot more from the book. Yes the photographs are good, but I felt like this much adulated photobook would be on another level.<br /><br />If you enjoy Robert Frank and  the idea of yesteryear's &#34;America&#34;, then this book is for you.

B00002616T|5.0|I had this album on vinyl, but along with all my records they were plundered or lost. I also got rid of my turntable, so I am gradually replacing everything I loved on CD and this is one I have been seeking for a long time.  It was delivered, brand new, as promised and ahead of schedule.  It is as wonderful as I remembered it to be.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Actually it was totally incredible. Books like this are like letters from home, you get updated on characters you know and care about all while being greatly entertained by a terrific story. Michael Connelly is and should be recognized as a national treasure.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|Well i Find it Terrible that You want to get this Show on Blue Ray and Then you take it home and it does not work and you have to get the DVD Copy of it<br />So watch out NOT all blue Rays Play on a blue Ray player<br />Why because i got it today and then it just said play and did nothing at all,<br />Typical and No way it is BD LIVE and all that other junk, So watch out and look at my other reviews<br />SO 1 star for Blue ray copy<br />Did not get it from Amazon but if i did then i would ask for a dvd copy of it<br />WEll I have been waiting a long time for this to come out onto either blue Ray or Dvd. It is not like i can watch the Tv Stations because depending on what system you have it is hard to watch the show.<br />This Show from Season 1 was great and it continues to rock and tells more and more each season. I am amazed about the story lines and how much they tell then the movies you get.<br />If you are a huge Star wars Fan i would say to get this Season because if you have the Seasons 1-4 then you will need to get this show.<br />I am not a big fan of box sets unless they have good stuff in it and you do not have the Seasons already.<br />At the time of Season one i did not have Blue Ray and i think that now having a blue Ray Player is good.  So for all those who have Blue Ray get this show.<br />If you Have already seen the movies 1,2,3,4,5,6 then get these show because yes they go quickly if you watch them back to back but you get so much out of it that you want more.<br />Now if you do not know they it is already in the works to Make the movies 7, 8, 9,<br />Now i am not sure what other story lines they will tell but will wait to see what the movie number 7 tells us after number 6 movie.<br />good luck in getting this show.<br />About the price wow, find it lower or on sale if you can who knows if they will make Season 6
B005K17RU0|5.0|One of several weather apps I have, but the only one I use. I like the presentation and the simplicity and the price was right

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|How many of these novels are we to purchase to kind out if Eva and Gideon end up together or not?
B0054YIQLW|3.0|I've owned this previously on a VCR tape, and its a nice way to watch an opera.  Unfortunately both of the DVD copies which I received (and returned) would play, but with no sound (an opera without sound).  As much as I enjoy Carmen, the product which I received was defective.
B00821OX98|4.0|I liked the series, is not super high budget production but is appealing. I wish Amazon will have the Option for Close Caption or sub titles.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|I tried to enjoy this movie, but there were too many holes in the story and the science behind this movie was not consistent. I thought the love relationship between the 2 main characters were not developed enough for me to care about their fates. The makers of this movie planted a great seed, but did bloom. I'm getting tired of people giving horrible movies 4 or 5 stars. 4 or 5 stars should be reserved for movies you would like to watch again or share with family & friends. I have come to the conclusion that the good reviews come from people involved in the making the movie. Too many \\"plants\\" on Amazon Prime Instant Video.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is hours of fun and its cool cause you can build whatever you want. The new update is awesome with the buckets and fire.
0440242401|5.0|This was a super fun read as all of Kinsella's books are. Not too much brain-power needed, just a good time. If you're in the mood for chick-lit it doesn't get much better than this. REMEMBER ME was addictively hard to put down as well as LOL funny in places and I got sucked right into the chaos of the heroine's life and the double romance. Imagine not remembering that you're having an affair.<br /><br />Lexi Smart is having a crappy night, in her words \\"On a scale of one to ten we're talking ...a minus six. And it's not like I even have very high standards.\\"<br /><br />Standing in the rain after a night out clubbing with friends, Lexi just wants to find a taxi, get home and kick off her agonizing boots. Yup, it's been a crap day all right, her boyfriend (Loser Dave) stood her up and her second-rate job managed to screw her out of the Christmas bonus on a technicality. Tomorrow promises to be even worse though, it's her father's funeral. Before she can moan about the state of her life any further Lexi tops the night off by slipping on the wet street and tumbling down a flight of stairs.<br /><br />When Lexi wakes up she's in a London hospital, but hold on something's a little off... she's in a private room and her nails are manicured, her teeth are perfect (guess they can't call her Snaggletooth anymore) her body is toned and thin (squeal) and her handbag is Vuitton.<br /><br />The nurse also mentioned that she was in a car accident (in a Mercedes no less) but Lexi can't drive and she definitely can't afford that car or that purse. When her Mother and sister show up Lexi starts to panic because her mother looks strange and damn, what's happened to her little sister, she's all grown up?<br /><br />As the Doctors explain it Lexi is suffering from amnesia and is missing the last 3 years of her life which would mean she's now...28 (sob) but it's not all bad because somehow in that time she's married a hunky multimillionaire and become a cooperate big shot. Apparently she now lives in a Kensington loft and has a personal assistant and a trainer and new puffy lips and a carb free diet and glamorous new friends (what about her old friends and toast?)<br /><br />Lexi's got a ton of catching up to do if she's going to make this exciting new life work and she might just pull it off. But she misses her friends (they won't even talk to her anymore) and toast (sigh) and can't understand how she become that b!tch \\"The Cobra\\" at the office and this is all before Jon the architect shows up. Yeah Jon, the guy she's supposedly having an affair with and is going to leave her husband for.<br /><br />This book just hit the spot.

B008JFUO4U|3.0|As of late I have had trouble watching any Tom Cruise movie. His reputation as a complete a**hole and his $cientology connections. I dislike him as as person but he is a decent actor and his sci fi stuff is alright, still he always seems to be an \\"intense, focused\\" a**hole in everything he does , he was okay here.<br />How ever I felt that I was watching a movie set in the land scape of Fallout3 without the best parts of that game. The plot was engaging while still predictable and I felt the love story was forced. The best actor, Morgan freeman did not have near enough screen time.<br />The special effects were pretty good but not mind blowing.<br />And while somewhat enjoyable, almost an hour and 20 minutes in I still wasn't sure if Morgan wasn't the real hero or the main villain.<br />Borrow a friends copy rather than buy this one
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I liked this game.  I couldn't put it down. Every chapter is saved so that you don't have to start over, the games were just right for relaxing play.  This is a fun game that is just challenging enough.  I recommend this game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was an easy to read book that I had to read for I project very well written yay
0064471837|5.0|A wonderful book (and series) that I've read through numerous times throughout my childhood and even now that I'm in my late 20's. This book really set the bar high in the sci-fi/fantasy genre and will keep you entertained throughout.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Great game. A must play for free games. Only draw back is the length of time it takes to get more tokens to play again.
B00DYEN5QU|4.0|Nolans take on the M.O.S. was a breathe of fresh air in contrast to Bryan Singers 'Man of steel'! They definitely picked the right man for the job...great story concept, great movie Christopher Nolan!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun to play, and its just like playing the card game except with our kindled!!!!! I would definitely recommend purchasing the app.
0783231032|3.0|1941 is a fun anti-war movie that seems to explode into a thousand pieces of crazy entertainment. This is a Steven Spielberg movie representing his brilliant creativity, early in his movie making career, seeing is believing, especially the submarine opening.
B007SGM084|5.0|Even when the book would start re describing things I just couldn't stop reading. Very good book! Hoping for another series!!
0440217563|5.0|I enjoyed Voyager so much better than Dragonfly in Amber!!!  In this book I really come to like Claire, especially when she is reunited with Jaime.  Maybe because she is older and more mature.  I find her more sensitive and real.  As in the other books, I cannot get enough of Jaime - flaws and all (although not many in my opinion).  The author's descriptions throughout the book are amazing.  This book was not boring and had many surprises.  As usual with this series, you need to try and remember everything you read, however inconsequential it may seem, because it will come full circle.  I felt like I was swept away with Claire, Jamie and the rest.  It is very far-fetched at times and unbelievable how danger always follows them; however, it is fiction!  The emotions this series invokes in the reader is incredible.  I still have many questions, but I hope as I continue to read the series, my questions will be answered.  I look forward to reading the next book!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|In short: the story was captivating for carnal reasons only and the writing was that of your average chick lit. Three stars at best. Though I will be looking into the rest of the trilogy..I am a woman after all.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I am thoroughly surprised on this book's material, he did an amazing job on making the material light and enjoyable to read without sickening examples of friends who change their lives upside down following his method. Chopra summarized Islam 101 in few pages, that if Muslims follow their religion to the spiritual extent.

B000WYF2FW|5.0|This is his greatest work. My Sweet Lord, Wah-Wah, Beware of the Darkness, Apple Scuffs, Awaiting On You All, Run Of The Mill,  Isn't it A Pity, What Is Life, If Not For You. Harrison was an artist,  a pioneer in music, and a beautiful human being.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Loved reading every moment of the story from the swirling beginning to the unexpected ending. A great story any fan of the author will enjoy this expirience.
0307949508|5.0|wonderful detailed oriented very put together, great author better than the first book, the girl with the dragon tatoo. thank you.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I would be careful to put this on your kindle. It seemed like this app is a tracking device. I deleted the app
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|i just love this movie, most of all javier bardem is absolutely fascinating, wonderful, and is a great actor. thank you.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super simple and I know it will only get better!  I was able to set it up in about a minute and start streaming Netflix!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|But realized I am further along in my journey than this book was...its a great book for people just starting out and who need demonstration of how the Universe works and it demonstrates how we create our own life and the energy we emit.<br />Really important to have this data.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a really cool app if your bored and want a time waster app that requires no internet then get this app it's really easy and really fun :)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this to help me sleep and it's awesome. I have found a combination of sounds that just helps so much. I'll have busy times where I'll actually forget to use this at night, and I'll wonder why I didn't sleep well, why I kept waking up. Then I would remember and I'd turn this on again and I swear, I'm out before even 20 minutes goes by. Think it works on my dog too!
0545425115|5.0|My son (12 yrs old)  and I read the entire series. We found these to be great reading. The content for a 12 year old may not be acceptable for some but he has been reading at an advanced level for many years and this kept his interest and &#34;understood&#34; the content.  I would recommend &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; series.
B00BX8PG5M|5.0|This case for my iPhone 5 is excellent . The price was reasonable, it looks good it's small footprint is not intrusive and I would highly recommend this to anyone with an Apple iPhone.
B009O07NDY|4.0|Cons:  I felt they skimped on the packaging for the CD itself.  When I buy music, I expect a jewel case, not paper sleeves glued into the binding of the cardboard book.<br />Pros:  The CD-sized book almost makes up for the lack of a jewel case.  At 36 pages, the lyrics, movie summary, movie artwork, and photos of the orchestra, was a pleasant surprise,  The insert promises further media content if you have a smartphone.  Alas, I do not.  Perhaps someone else will indulge us with those paths I have not trodden.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game. I remember this game when I was very young in my children hood memory. Thanks you for bringing it back.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|Beautiful, joyful music.....always joyful from David Garrett.  He bridges the gap between classical and rock/pop.  And he does it awesomely!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this story.  The twists and turns, the ins and outs. It was hard to put down.  I especially liked how real it was and how the author told you what could have been at the end.  LOVED that!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have used this application for over a year. I have had no problems. Calculator Plus Free is my number two favorite app behind my email application. This app is simple and very easy to use. I reach for it everytime I need to make a calculation.
0751548170|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and was sad when it ended. I've been a fan for years, and was happy to see the old Scarpetta, seem rejuvenated.  I really enjoy Cornwell, and happily add this book to my collection.
B0055ANHBY|5.0|Nice kit.  As good as Airfix has ever done and better than most of their kits.  Good panel detail and crisp lines.
B00CIFK316|4.0|I thought the illustrations were mainly by Sidney Paget and reproductions of The Strand Magazine Sherlock Holmes stories. What I got were some Sidney Paget illustrations, color photos, and pictures from the latest Sherlock Holmes movie. The photos really detract from the stories.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Dexter is the one show about being bad that everyone should see.  Perfect.  Gets better every season which is a tough act.
B00CATSONE|4.0|it is in the context of trying to link him to many great men who early on did not show the great promise that they in fact possessed. In that sense it tries to be inspirational for everyone who may have hidden talent!
B00A822VDY|4.0|You would think with John Goodman and Billy Crystal at the comedy helm, this movie would have delivered much more fun and craziness and also be much more 'colored' in it's humor. Yeah, it's alright for a G, but I think it would have worked better if it was more adult-oriented with a minimum of PG-13 rated stuff coming from the lips of two of the best improv-style comedians that we know. This leads me to believe that &#34;Monsters University&#34; can't possibly be that reflective of college pranks and life and will be a bigger let-down than &#34;Monsters, Inc.&#34; was.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This thing is awesome..... I am enjoying it and it is so user friendly. A must have. If you have children who is in to computers than get them one of these too..
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is just awesome. After I downloaded the game and as soon as I got to play it, it was the funniest game ever
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this game is really fun!  and its free!!! &lt;3  i also like challenging my friends. ( mostly to watch them lose) ;)
B009JBWOU0|1.0|What a waste of money. Neither of the so called 'DVDs' work on anything. Not on an Xbox 360, PC or on an actual DVD player! I want a complete refund.
B00062PN6I|4.0|Better than I expected for the price. I use them to listen to my mp3's on the computer. The headphones have a full range of sound, from deep base to the higher tones.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I was worried after all the awful reviews that this wouldnt be worth my time. was I wrong.<br />My library had it on dvd so no loss. I figured I'd take it out after 5 mins if I didnt<br />love it. I was compelled to keep watching. A wonderful ensemble cast. Even John Lithgow for<br />crying out loud. Hilarious. I can see younger childless folks finding this less worthwhile<br />because let's face it they havent truly evolved into adults without reproducing. Definitely<br />and totally true to life. And Leslie's actual children as her kids, pretty amazing.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|We have extra cables for use in different rooms. No complaints with this product. One thing we have found, is that with a lot of<br />bending of the cord it becomes weak and comes apart (unravels) at the attachment points, however they still work even if this happens.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|It's fun at first but gets hard then  annoying then I get a headache  and it's good then boring then bad.
B0090SI56Y|5.0|In brief, I highly recommend this film. It is very different from Origins and in my opinion far, far, far superior. Beautifully shot, wonderfully directed, with a compelling, mysterious story and a brilliant cast. The Japan setting (most of the film) lends a unique sense of stylization. There are a couple of high-concept plot elements that may be a bit of a stretch, but I do not mind, because the characters and personal moments are so strong. The pacing is great, and the film builds to an intense climax.<br /><br />I keep seeing apologies made for the \\"lack of action\\" - I can only think that the reference is to \\"action\\" in terms of wild CGI and buildings exploding. Because this film has the best action of any comic book/superhero film that I have ever seen, but much of it is in the form of hand-to-hand combat. The fight choreography is dazzling, and it feels a lot more real than anything in The Avengers. Logan using his claws to duel against combatants with katana swords? What an awesome concept, and that is just one example. This is a fantastic action film that fortunately balances that dynamic out with plenty of heart and character driven content as well. Very well done.

1490313370|5.0|I had never heard of James Altucher before I was given this book.  It came as a birthday present, alongside what ended up feeling like a pile of self-help books.  I know that the gift giver did not intend my birthday haul to resemble the self-help aisle of a bookstore (plus flip flops), but it certainly felt that way.  Oh right, there was a bottle of tequila too!  So, forgive me if it took me a while to bother even looking at this book, but here is what I have to say about it, now that I've read it:<br /><br />I liked it.  There are plenty of life lessons in this book, and sure, the requisite amount of cheese.  Although, I suppose many would simply see that bit as \\"accessible\\"?  Regardless, it is certainly written with a level of informality that will offend some and attract others.  I don't agree with everything that Altchur says, but the thing that I really liked about this book is that it feels like a well articulated hard copy of the life-lessons that I have already learned but can't manage to hold on to; like an outline of things I keep trying to remember all at once and keep forgetting.  We all have our lifelong battles.  My own tend to focus on maintaining momentum.  Someone once said that \\"life is like riding a bicycle. It's all about balance and forward momentum.\\"  Reading this book feels a little like my dad holding my bicycle handlebars when I was just starting to internalize what it felt like to hit the groove of riding a two wheeler.<br /><br />Did I mention I'm 32?<br /><br />The other thing that I liked about this book is that it totally validated some of my own beliefs.  I don't work in a bank, ergo why do I have to wake up at 7am if that just doesn't work for me?  People LOVE to judge, and haters are going to hate.  Having someone tell you that it is okay to make your own rules, while at the same time reminding you that if you're going to make your own rules then you have to ACTUALLY follow through and make them, is a good combination.<br /><br />You can't expect to get all of life's answers out of a book.  You can't expect anyone else to live your life for you.  I think that people who don't like this book are looking for the answers to their problems in a book.  This book isn't the answer to your problem, but it just might help you stop long enough to see a doorway that you would have otherwise missed.<br /><br />Another thing---Altucher pronounces the American Dream dead.  Time of Death: 2008.  Personally, I understand the point that he is trying to make.  To a large degree, I agree with him, but anyone who still lives, works, or aspires to be a part of \\"corporate America\\" is not going to like the fact that he actually said it in print.  Not to mention to the fact that there are certain industries that aren't dead yet (although even industries like law and medicine are changing very fast). Now---Mr. Altucher, please correct me if I am wrong----I think what he is trying to say is that there is no longer any guaranteed path to earning a living.  You can still go to Law school and become a lawyer.  You can still got to Medical school and become a doctor.  You can still get an MBA---end of sentence (not going to even try to add anything to that one).  In the past, if you did any one of those three things, you were pretty much guaranteed a financial future.  The time when a J.D., M.D., or M.B.A. equaled lifelong income, is over.<br /><br />The point is that that doesn't have to be a BAD thing.  Sure, it's scary, but it is also a future ripe with opportunity.  If you can't get behind the statement I just made, then don't bother reading the book.  if you can agree with even part of it, then read it.<br /><br />Having said that, I think the way that this issue is approached in the book doesn't quite translate. If you want to have a conversation about whether or not the American Dream is in fact dead, then have one, but this book isn't really about whether or not it's true.  This book is built on the premise that the paradigm has already shifted.  The state of the U.S. job market is such that you could write an entire encyclopedia on the dynamics of employment.  That's not the point. This book takes it as a given that if you're reading it, you probably already have a sense that things are no longer the way they once were.  If you are already looking for a way around the establishment, then no problem; Altucher gives you tools to try and forge a new pathway.  If you are part of the establishment and perfectly content to stay there, then you're not going to like the fact that Altucher just said \\"what you think you have no longer exists.\\"<br /><br />There is a line in the book where Altchur says you have two choices: be a temp or be an entrepreneur.  I think the \\"temp\\" part of this sentence is broader than temp agencies, or \\"dead-end\\" jobs that pay the rent.  I think Mr. Altucher probably meant that you have to get used to the fact that your \\"job\\" even your \\"career\\" is temporary---again, please correct me, If I am wrong.<br /><br />If you can't accept that the ground has already shifted beneath our feet, then you're going to have a problem with this book.  If you pick up this book because you recognize that the ground has already shifted?  Then \\"Choose Yourself\\" is a great little toolbox, full of ways to build or rebuild part or all of your life.<br /><br />FInally, I would like to add one more thing.  I would have like to given this book 4.5 stars, but that's not an option. 4.5 because (1) I'm not in love with the cover and (2) there is certainly a little cheesiness/informality within, and (3) I don't like the title.  Now, if you've read the book, hopefully you'll get the... joke? irony? self-deprecation? symmetry?  I don't know. I just know that I liked the content a whole lot---not quite enough to give it my all-time high rating, but high enough that I'll give it 5 stars instead of 4.  Besides, 4.5 should be rounded up to 5 anyway.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game was great! I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a hidden object game with mind puzzles mixed in. I dropped one star b/c the touch sensitivity needs to be improved. It made some of the puzzles nearly impossible to complete (although I did beat it). Also, sometimes the voices would just stop. The dialogue boxes were still there so you didn't miss anything. It was definitely challenging to some degree. I really liked it though. I am playing on a 2nd generation Kindle Fire. Don't think it's HD.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I love both of these actors and to have them together in a movie like this is fantastic. A perfect mix.
0374214913|5.0|I read this book with my book club and loved pretty much everything about it:  The author's writing style, the storyline, the setting, the characters. Did I mention the author's writing style?  He writes as if he's talking - I love that.  Robin Sloan does such a great job of developing the hero and the fabulous supporting characters. As I've said before, for me, it's all about the characters, and in this book, they were so real that it was like I was reading about people I know.  I love that in a book!  Parts of the book were laugh-out-loud funny, like the hamster analogy.  This was just a fun and quirky book, and it was an absolute pleasure to read.  Yay, Robin Sloan!
B000SVZIDA|4.0|Just a bit kooky. Great songs though and the 2 stars do a great job for singing. Most definitely a musical of the times.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Figure out how to paint each of 44 balls according to its template. Have to work simultaneously in positive & negative spaces. Really enjoyed this game. Very challenging and stimulating. Too bad it was so short - under an hour to do all 44 levels. I don't hold that against the game, though.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|I tried to watch the video but the feed kept stopping and error messages kept popping up. Never finished watching it
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Being a lawyer, I thought I would dislike the premise of this show (20 something practicing law without a license), but I can totally look past it! The writing is thought out, the story line is great, there's just enough drama and the characters are provocative. In Season One, they do a great job of giving you a lot of different cases. Second season is great for the character development - and usually those seasons can be a little dry, but not this one. Thank you USA for producing such a refreshing and ingenious show!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|An entertaining account of prison life. Provides the reader the opportunity to see prisoners as people and not identified by their crimes.
0062255657|3.0|This is a very short and strange story.  While reading it, there were so many similarities to the Harry Potter series that it felt like a bad rip-off.  Lettie the heroine is 11 and has magical powers that she is developing; that was Hermione's age when she went to Hogwarts.  The young boy gets himself into trouble and needs the help of Lettie to get him out of it (Harry and Ron).  Old Mrs. Hempstock has tons of knowledge, wisdom and magical powers, slyly helps Lettie and the young boy, but never overtly until it is absolutely necessary just like Dumbledor.  The home of Lettie, Mrs. Helpstock and Old Mrs. Hemstock has lots of land, a garden, many animals and is not up to date; something like what Hagrid lived in.  Mandrakes are used by Lettie and she reference their screaming and a sneaky, slightly mean ginger cat (Mrs. Norris) also makes an appearance.<br /><br />If you have read Harry Potter then you don't need to read this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had great twists and turns and I really enjoyed it. Different than most books I have read in the past!
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix quickly became one of my very favorite authors, and he is probably my favorite still living. Sabriel is a strong, brave heroine, something I really appreciate, and his writing is just so vivid and imaginative. This is not your typical fantasy adventure. It is gripping, intense, dark, and beautiful. I recommend the entire Abhorsen Trilogy and I am beyond excited that Nix's prequel, Clariel, will be released next year. His collection of short stories, Across the Wall: A Tale of the Abhorsen and Other Stories, is also amazing and well worth a read.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Kept me interested and flipping the digital pages.  Not as good as good as the first, felt rushed and repetitive compared to the first book.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's an okay app, but since the latest update I find all the new ads really annoying, so use it much less often.
0756697875|5.0|As usual I have bought another one of these Lego books for my grandson.  He really enjoys them and also loves that it comes with another Lego figure on the front.  This time it was Batman.
0425267695|5.0|Masterfully well crafted storytelling. The plot unfolds and develops in really exciting ways, definitely reccommend to any one who is a fan of fantasy fiction.
B00C061HZY|5.0|There is so much I could say about this album. Big fan of Daft Punk, and they really out-did themselves on this album. All of the collaborating artist, just make the album more diverse, interesting, and all around amazing. This album hits more of a disco feel, but still has the familiar signature electronic sounds that make Daft Punk, Daft Punk. I got the Cd & vinyl on day one, and so glad I did. The album was so great, and I have been listening to it over and over again since the day of it's release.
0425266060|4.0|If you think 50 shades is good then you'll like this. Great read, it will keep your attention. Highly recommended.
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix goes above and beyond what most fantasy writers achieve in this first book of his Abhorsen Trilogy.  I was first lent a copy by my fiancee (then girlfriend) who almost didn't get it back.  Since then the two of us have read this book (and the two following novels Lirael and Abhorsen) so many times that the spines are beginning to fall apart.  The characters are deep, the story is compelling and you will have a hard time putting this down until you finish.
B00031TXBI|5.0|Aside from the album \\"Shadows Collide With People\\", I believe that most solo Frusciante will seem sub-par to the average Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.  The guitar solos are undeniably good but he sings in a passionate falsetto and his voice is nasal.  Klinghoffer's drumming is a lot more \\"organic\\" than Chad Smith's.  Klinghoffer reminds me of drummers who are famous for their expressiveness rather than their precision - drummers like Ginger Baker, Nick Mason and Keith Moon.  Upon repeated listening, I feel that Klinghoffer's in the same league... it's taken me a long time to really enjoy listening to him on guitar with the new RHCP, because I was so spoiled on the beautiful sound of his drumming from albums like this one.  Chad Smith is a much more precise and fancy drummer, though, so at first listen, the drumming seems inferior to RHCP as well.<br /><br />John's philosophy on this album and the others he released around this time was to simply make music, without the spit-polish and production values of Shadows or RHCP albums.  I was disappointed at first and felt that the sound on this album was too guitar-heavy, and that the beauty of the guitar work was marred somewhat by the strangeness of John's vocal style.<br /><br />For these reasons, I'd warn potential explorers to warm up to Shadows Collide With People and The Empyrean before jumping into John's other albums.  But the Klinghoffer rock-n-roll collaborations from 2004 that don't feature any other musicians (namely Inside of Emptiness and The Will To Death) are both great intermediate albums to warm up to his passion and raw, poetic, emotional songwriting, before exploring the sheer bizzare weirdness of albums like Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt or PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone.  Sphere In The Heart of Silence might be a good warm-up as well, as the softer sound and the synths might make it more accessible for fans of relatively slow-paced albums like By The Way and I'm With You.<br /><br />Once you'vegiven those a listen on mog, spotify, myspace, at your friend's, at the record store, whatever -- well, if you like what you hear, then, it's time to buy Inside of Emptiness.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />For a sample of the best of what this album has to offer, skip to 2:40 in \\"Look on\\" and take a gander at the guitar solo.  The only thing I can really compare it to is the solo in \\"I Could Have Lied\\" from Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  Most of the later-era RHCP solos are subdued in comparison to what you hear on the solo work.  It's like John can either do something that's polished and produced, or he can do something that's raw and passionate, but never quite both at the same time.<br /><br />Inside of Emptiness is the best of John's \\"raw and passionate\\" side without being too weird.  For a fanatic such as myself, it's worth at least 500 listens.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it's a great app for anyone who rides horses.  I tell all my friends about it.  I hope they like it as much as I do.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is beyond amazing, it definitely works as promised, sometimes guesses the words from movements that even I think don't make sense. Speeds up writing, has a lot of personalization options. It's definitely the best keyboard you can get for your smart phone.
1583762027|5.0|Brian Tracy gives you the basic tools to get motivated and get moving in 153 easy to read pages. The concepts are simple to understand and apply.

B00BKBCF38|4.0|I will say that I do not yet own this album but have only heard a few of the songs online a few times.  I have listened to the first album thoroughly and am definitely a fan of this band.  It seems that this album doesn't offer all of the metal goodness that the debut did but seems to have some great music on it.  Its great to be a metal head but expanding your horizons musically is important to becoming a better musician/songwriter etc..  I think everyone should take this album for more that it is on the initial listen.  That's all I have to say.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|Just perfect for a child gift.  Really looks real with great detail.<br />Little ones love to carry the turtle around in their pocket.<br />Super cute!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|simply. fun - good story - interesting puzzles - great grafics - dialogue to character iffy.<br />The sections are short enough to allow for relaxed play.  You can put it down and pick it up later to extend your enjoyment of the game (if you can put it down at all).
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|I LOVE this cd.  I heard it playing at Earthbound Trading Company a couple years ago and bought it on the spot.  I have used it for meditation, to help me go to sleep, and just to relax.  Currently, it is the cd we play to put our newborn daughter to sleep, and she relaxes so quickly after we turn it on.  It is beautiful, I can't say enough.
B0091QS88K|3.0|Boys play it on their tablet and enjoy a lot, need to set up their own account tho so I don't keep getting review requests for all the free games :)
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I played this game a long time ago on and old phone, and recently installed it on my Google Nexus 4 because I was looking for a good game to play while listening to audiobooks.  I could be mistaken, but I think the number of levels in the game has tripled since the time I used to play it on my old phone.  There are 150 levels, including 15 puzzle levels.  Not only are there a lot of levels, but I like to play each level until I can completely clear the board, which usually takes at least 2 tries, sometimes several.<br /><br />Every level is different, and some of the new levels have cool features, like bricks that float.<br /><br />This is a great game and well worth the cost.  If you like to play games while listening to audiobooks, I highly recommend this one.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Ok. I will not rehash the plot of the story, as many reviewers before be had already done so. All I can say is that I loved the movie.<br /><br />Now, in regards to the BluRay disc. Depending on the type of player you have, and the speed of your internet, might want to disconnect your internet from the BluRay player before you try to watch the disc. I have high speed internet access, high enough that I can stream HD movies from Amazon without buffering, but the disc took almost 10 minutes to load, as it accessed the internet to download more bloody trailers, and being a Universal Disc, it would not let me bypass the previews by pressing Top Menu or Title Menu. However, I found that by removing the BluRay player from the internet, the disc started to play right away with no delays. Hope that this helps anyone who ends up with a blank screen for more then 5 minutes on the Universal titles.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I am a freshman (soon to be sophomore) in college and had gained about five pounds since starting freshman year. Sure, I hadn't gained the \\"Freshman 15\\", but I really was not happy with the way I looked at the end of freshman year. So, I hopped onto Amazon and looked at Jillian Michael's DVDs. First, let me just say that Amazon offers an amazing price for a bundle of 3 Jillian Michael's workout DVD's. I purchased the 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, and 6 Week 6-Pack for about $25 and free shipping-you can't beat that! As soon as I got home for the summer, I began with the 30 Day Shred. The first day was KILLER. I hadn't worked out all year and that very first workout made me so sick. But then, I began to ease into exercising again and was okay. 30 Day Shred consists of 3 levels, each to be done for 10 days. I like this concept, but then again, after 10 days, each level began to get really boring. I practically had each level memorized by the end of each of the ten days. But, I stuck with it. I weighed myself at the end of each of the ten days, but I didn't see a huge change, which disappointed me. I saw so many success stories on Amazon's review section of the 30 Day Shred. In fact, instead of losing any weight, I gained some! But I soon figured out that I was gaining muscle, not fat. I love that Jillian works in strength moves-it made me a lot stronger. At the end of the 30 Day Shred, I had only lost about three pounds. However, I was a lot stronger and my endurance was so much better than it was when I first started. All in all, this workout DVD is great for those of us who fell off the exercising bandwagon, but want to get back on.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Loved this movie back in the day and still do.  The dialogue is so well written.  James steals a very violent scene with Arquette.  For Tarantino fans a must own.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is a blast! Its an endless play mode game, but thankfully it has a pause button.

6305633177|5.0|I bought this DVD to replace the VHS I had scince 1990;all tghough I've seen it befor that(think I was in 5 or 6 grade).I love the old METALLICA '81-'86 (Justice is a good album after that forget it).They were raw,energetic,and inocent. This is a bunch of footage with Cliff Burton (R.I.P) Thier second bass player. In my opinion this is METALLICA at thier best;and I also think the spirit and sound of METALLICA died when Cliff died. I,ve tried to listen to the new stuff. I just cant;I'm not into it. Every time I watch this DVD I cry and think about what other great music Cliff could have given us. Cliff was and still is one of the most phanominal bass players that ever lived.(my opinion)You might think its strange;but every year on Sept 26 @ 9pm I play the final gig in remembrance of Cliff( I do the same for his first show \\"Mar 5 '83\\" he played with the band). Any fan of METALLICA or Cliff Burton should own this dvd. And to all the pepole that complain about the quallity and sound live with it!Can you realize how hard it was to get those bulky,heavy cameras in there. Cameras of the 70s and 80s were not made like they are today. Go on the net and try to find their old stuff on film. It's hard,and the stuff you do find is off this DVD. Buy this now you won't regret it!!!!!

B008220DIC|4.0|\\"Comparisons are not invariably odious, but they are often misleading,\\" Orson Welles once wrote, in reference to the long-running debate over whether or not the many parallels in his film \\"Citizen Kane\\" to the real life story of William Randolph Hearst and the rise of his powerful publishing empire were purely coincidental. It is quite possible that current and future generations of critics and audiences will engage in similar debate regarding the parallels in writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, \\"The Master to the real life story of L. Ron Hubbard and the founding of his Church of Scientology.<br /><br />Despite a number of \\"coincidences\\", the answer to the most obvious question is, \\"no\\". This is neither a hagiography nor a smack down of any specific doyen or belief system (thinly disguised or otherwise). Anyone who would pigeonhole the film with such a shallow reading likely has not seen it (or is perhaps unfamiliar with certain prevalent themes running through all of PTA's previous films). What he has crafted is a thought-provoking and startlingly original examination of why human beings in general are so prone to kowtow to a burning bush, or an emperor with no clothes.  Is it a spiritual need? Is it an emotional need? Or...is it purely a lizard brain response, embedded in our DNA?<br /><br />As Inspector Clouseau once ruminated, \\"Well you know, there are leaders...and there are followers.\\" At its most rudimentary level, \\"The Master\\" is a two-character study about a leader and a follower (and metaphorically, all leaders and followers. Anderson frames his narrative using the zeitgeist of America's existential post-WW2 malaise, in the person of ex-sailor Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). Socially withdrawn, prone to dipsomania, odd sexual compulsions and unpredictable fits of rage, Freddie's transition back to civilian life has not been a smooth one. In fact, the character of Freddy strongly recalls the archetypal \\"disillusioned vet\\" protagonist who pops up time and again throughout the classic film noir cycle of the 1940s and 1950s.<br /><br />Freddie's laundry list of personality disorders has not endeared him to the 5 o'clock world; he drifts from job to job. Headed for a meltdown, Freddy skulks in the shadows of a San Francisco marina, where he crashes a shipboard wedding party, hoping to stow away. It turns out that the ship is captained by the father of the bride, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd is a self-described writer/doctor/nuclear physicist/ philosopher and \\"...a hopelessly inquisitive man.\\"  He is also a burgeoning cult leader; the boat is chock-a-block with devotees in thrall with Dodd and his philosophy, referred to as \\"The Cause\\".<br /><br />Initially, the paranoid Dodd admonishes his uninvited guest, suspecting him to be some manner of government spook assigned to infiltrate his organization; but instead of giving him the heave-ho, \\"something\\" compels him to do a sudden 180 and invite the twitchy and troubled Freddie along for an imminent (Homeric?) ocean voyage with his family and followers to New York. And so begins the life-altering relationship between the two men, which vacillates tenuously between master/servant, mentor/apprentice, and father/son (the latter recalling Philip Baker Hall and John C. Reilly in \\"Hard Eight\\", Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg in \\"Boogie Nights\\", Tom Cruise and Jason Robards in \\"Magnolia\\", and Daniel Day-Lewis and Dillon Freasier/Paul Dano in \\"There Will Be Blood\\").<br /><br />Not to denigrate Hoffman, who is mesmerizing as always; nor fine supporting performances from the likes of Amy Adams (as Dodd's subtly controlling wife, who plays a sort of shrewd Livia to his mercurial Augustus) or Laura Dern,but Phoenix achieves an Oscar-worthy transformation. I don't know if this was by accident or by design, but I swear he is channeling Montgomery Clift, not only replicating his acting tics and vocal inflection, but his physicality (right down to the hunched shoulders and sunken chest-it is downright eerie).<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot in 65mm by DP Mihai Malainare, Jr., and nicely scored by Jonny Greenwood. Those with short attention spans are warned: This film demands your full attention (and begs repeated viewings). It's exhilarating, audacious, and while at times a bit baffling, it is never dull.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|It's difficult to describe either of these games in a simple way.  They are both extremely special and like nothing you have ever played or will ever play again.<br /><br />The stronger game of the two is Shadow of the Colossus.  It is one of the most thoughtful and beautiful games you will ever play, but you have to use your imagination and really get invested into it emotionally or it won't have the same impact.<br /><br />Ico hasn't aged as well as Shadow, but it is very similar in that if you use a little imagination and invest your emotions into it, you will have a great experience.  I sometimes had to push myself to play through it as it gets a little slow at times but if you really get into it you will certainly enjoy it if you play to the finish.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|I loved this book. It paints a vivid picture of London throughout the centuries, using a series of loosely connected families. Lots of historical information, while remaining an entertaining read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a very inexpensive way to broadcast your mobile devices to your television.  A lot of people have grumbled about it a separate power connection, but I didn't have an issue with it.<br /><br />The set up was very fast, and I have moved it from one TV to another several times with no problems.  On my TVs, there is a USB port next to an available HDMI port, so I just power the Chromecast on the USB there.<br /><br />I have been using it most for YouTube and playing music.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Expertly crafted characters. Wonderful story. You get sucked into the Shadow World almost immediately. All around great read. Highly recommended.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The third season is even better and more suspenseful than seasons 1&2. It is great that I can watch these episodes whenever I want.<br />Thanks Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Charles W.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I purchased this GPS receiver about a 8 months ago with no specific application in mind.  A couple weeks ago I decided to test it with my Raspberry Pi single-board computer and it worked perfectly.  I used the GPSD service on Linux to retrieve GPS stats from the receiver.  It worked out of the box without any issues.  The receiver is very sensitive and works indoors about 10 feet from the nearest window.  I would definitely recommend this GPS receiver and will probably buy another in the near future.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|The beginning and middle of \\"Sound City\\" were amazing. I was captivated by the music, the stories, and the photographs. I'd give the first hour and ten minutes of this movie 5-stars. Easy.<br /><br />But where the documentary should have stopped, it didn't. Rather, we're treated to a strangely out-of-place, forty minute masturbatory jam session with Dave Grohl and others. And don't get me wrong, I'm a Grohl fan. But this part of the film was not necessary, and added little to nothing of value, in my opinion. It was Grohl, McCartney, Rick Springfield and others sitting around Grohl's studio gushing about how great one another are. How that adds to the wonderful story of the Sound City studio is beyond me.<br /><br />I wish they would have omitted this entire section, and rather spent more time interviewing and telling the stories of other bands, such as Tool or RATM.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Love this case, easy to pop on and off, doesn't add alot of weight or bulk to it and being able to put it at the angle I want is very helpful!
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Was very surprised to enjoy this book so much, characters were all interesting and involved with the storyline throughout story.
0553384775|3.0|Bait and switch. So I thought this was going to be a book on his rise to power and then his demise. The story of how Wall Street drove him over the edge. Well I was half right. This book only covers his fall not his rise. I think the rise would have been way more interesting. The fall is interesting but you can see it coming. You know he can't keep going on a the pace of drugs and craziness. Also way too much about his home life and not enough about the firm. I wanted to read Boiler Room and I got the Great Gatsby. Still I felt compelled to finish it.
B00280LYIC|4.0|It was a great book with a well planned sequence of events it's just wasn't appropriate for my age so I'm going onto more difficult books :)
1451678193|5.0|I remember thumbing through this book at a library as I recalled the mini-series that came out on TV a long while back. Figuring I would give it a try for the nostalgia of it, I found myself drawn into this collection filled with underlying, relevant themes that the author returns to again and again with unique twists. Science fiction has the potential to explore so many ideas and I love how Bradbury makes the genre a part of literary craft instead of simply another line of pulp fiction.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Super fun game but u cant play a lot. You can only play 2 games a day. good luck. good luck. good luck

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I love K. Follett, but this is not his best material. Very readable and even though i think it is 800 pages, it is an easy read. The best part is how Follett fuses history into the story. But it is far from riveting. I cant put my finger on it , but Pillars and World were better

0375701427|5.0|I have been a Philip Roth fan ever since reading PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT in the 1980s, unable to stifle my laughter while riding public transportation. This is my second time reading AMERICAN PASTORAL, a very different story from PORTNOY'S. In it, Roth grippingly portrays the demise of Swede Levov, aka Seymour Irving Levov, who very early in life attained mythic status in his Newark hometown.<br /><br />Slowly, but surely--agonizingly surely--we witness Swede's expulsion from \\"the longed-for American pastoral and into everything that is its antithesis and its enemy, into the fury, the violence, and the desperation of the counterpastoral--into the indigenous American berserk\\" (p. 86).<br /><br />I have joined the long line of readers waiting for Roth, now 80 years old, to finally win the Nobel Prize for Literature.
1422188612|4.0|This is the second time my husband bought this book...this time was just a refresher before starting a new job...he highly recommends it.

0064471837|5.0|This book sets the story apart from many others in this Genre. The challenges that Sabriel has to overcome can be likened to many things that each and every one of us face every day, without the undead of course. It's relatable and really does a great job of introducing some really important story concepts without making it hard to understand. The characters are all interesting and seem to progress through lives that keep you interested in who they are becoming, and what will happen next to them.<br /><br />The system of magic used in these books is interesting and illustrates a clear defining point between good and evil. Or rather chaos and order. Free magic tempered by charter magic infusing the bells of the Abhorsen as he or she fights the forces of death to keep humans safe.<br /><br />My favorite part thing about this book would have to be that Sabriel is such a good person. She is actually a decent human being and the way she's introduced as having already been trained to know these things from the book of the dead, and yet be compassionate towards her new kingdom friends and teachers was great to see.<br /><br />Not to give things away but to complete my review I really enjoyed everything that Garth Nix did with this story. He wrote it in a way that anyone could read, understand, and enjoy. In these pages human emotions are captured and shown with such a completeness that you can actually tell these soldiers at the wall are frightened and you can feel their fear. I own this book, as well as Lyriel, and Abhorsen. I've read them each through a half dozen times in the years that I have been a fan of Garth Nix's work, and I probably will read them another half dozen before too long.
B000JJ4PDK|5.0|Sicc Intro,Sicc Everything.Str8 Classic from the 718.Shouts to Bobby Simmons from Flava Videos cuz he did a video for Gimme The Loot{I still don't know who's that rapping wit Big?},I remember when I first heard Unbelievable an thought it was Heavy D...This album brings bacc memorys.Shouts to Meth for showing luv when the rest was hating.This was history in the making an I know he was glad to cee apart of it.
B00CXQL828|4.0|Billy Sheehan rocks this disc---he is a bass player who knows to shred while serving the song & as usual Mike portnoy shines--and this really is a rock album-not fusion or metal--strait ahead rock with Ritchie kotzen supplying both good solid songwriting , above average vocal ability and an arsenal of guitar licks that blew me away-----saw Kotzen on the VH-1 Metal show displaying his licks -was impressed-bought the disc and was not disappointed---the only reason I'm going 5 star is because some of tunes had a &#34;heard it before&#34; feeling----but that actually can be a good thing---like rock--buy it
B00957T6X6|5.0|Just like the TV  Series.  Reads very well.  More detail.  I can't wait for next season to start.  It showed some of the surprisess of the seson.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|Haven't heard anything new like this for years-------It's like the best of Thin Lizzy all over again---twin leads, fantastic vocals/lyrics with a rock solid rhythm section-----this is not retro rock--the songwriting is superb as are the arrangements and production. I really love this disc--listen to it loud ---hoping it is an ongoing & touring band---something truly exciting for anyone who came from the classic rock era---buy it now but listen to it forever!!
0064471837|5.0|This book and its series is my all time favorite. The characters are wonderful and complex, and the world is beautifully crafted. Sabriel is a kick butt heroine whose flaws are realistic and relatable. I especially love Mogget and his mischief. The magic in this world is very interesting and always left me wanting to know more. All in all I would recommend this book to anyone and have introduced most of my friends to this world.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app has not many guns, but good ones. Its a fun little app if you're into more weaphones, and i hope it adds more soon, because it is a very fun app.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a dark fantasy about a young woman who can fight the 'dead.' These dead can vary from animated corpses to dangerous firy spirits and roam the 'Old Kingdom,' an ancient land of magic. She uses a set of bells, much like a necromancer, but her aim is to send them back to Death, which is described wonderfully. The book is of the old-fashioned quest-type (which I like best) and Sabriel sets out across the Old Kingdom battling spirits and meeting new friends along the way. This was the first Garth Nix book I ever read and I loved it so much I immediately read all the rest. The world-building is fantastic and the characters (especially Mogget) very enjoyable. I would recommend the book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, not just young adults.
059306495X|5.0|This is definitely the greatest thriller I have ever read. Deeply plotted; highly developed characters; incredible tension; scarifying terrorism; couldn't put this book down.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book... definitely a good read. My first Nicholas Sparks book I've read. I thought I was going to ruin the book by watching the movie before I finished the book... definitely didn't!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Inspired by a favorable reaction to some of Dream Theater's heaviest songs (played while the band was on tour), \\"Train Of Thought,\\" the 2003 opus from the New York-based, but world-renowned and massively influential progressive stalwarts finds the band opting for a more-or-less stripped down, and more accessible and straightforwardly heavy sound. And hate me for saying this if you must, but James LaBrie sounds like he listened to a lot of modern rock radio before recording his vocal parts for this album, as they sound like they are influenced by groups not unlike A.F.I., Korn, and Alice In Chains. This gives the musical arrangements an undeniable nu-ish-flavored quality, and one that is likely to ruffle the feathers of many-a-fan.<br /><br />But with that said, most of the usual D.T. trademarks are still firmly in place on \\"T.O.T.,\\" including (but not limited to) both heavy and melodic guitar riffs, technically-proficient leads, air-guitar-worthy solos from legendary seven-string ace John Petrucci, and really complex and dexterous drumming from skinsman Mike Portnoy. In addition, the song structuring might be more traditional and simplistic this time around, but there are frequent flights into proggy territory, with extended and drawn out instrumental sections that yield the songs as very unique, and meticulously-crafted. And plus, \\"Train\\" is another extremely epic affair, clocking in at a whopping sixty-nine-and-a-half minutes in length.<br /><br />\\"As I Am\\" opens the album with a wall of ominous guitar feedback that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand straight up before kicking in with an aggressive, heavy, chugging main riff that evokes Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman.\\" This is then iced by an accomplished and fairly warm-sounding clean vocal line, some choral backing vocals, and a strong, pronounced, depressive bass line that grumbles up from beneath the mix. And a terrific, ripping, and technically-impressive guitar solo caps the whole thing off. The Iron Maiden-influenced \\"This Dying Soul,\\" then, is centered around a muscular, lumbering, and positively doomy-sounding guitar line which is peppered by some hefty double bass propulsion, well-placed pinch harmonics, pronounced, moaning bass lines, and three excellent and incredibly wailing guitar solos. A classical music-derived piano line is also sprinkled into the mix, here, as are some soaring, old-school metal-approved vocals that sound along the same line as Ozzy Osbourne-meets-Chris Cornell. And there is a fine bit of epic, tasty, fiery, and instantly memorable guitar soloing to end the song, too.<br /><br />The dreary, dreamy melodic intro graced by guitar feedback, droning, bubbling bass notes, and colorful acoustic strumming, establish a very soothing and atmospheric vibe in the intro to \\"Endless Sacrifice.\\" And the song maintains this heavily progressive feel throughout its verses -- right up until the point when it reaches its choruses, which are suddenly much louder and heavier, thus evoking grunge and modern-day hard rock. But this song, while distinctly modern-sounding, is well over eleven minutes long (it is a whopping eleven minutes and twenty seconds long, to be exact). And furthermore, it is un-modern in that it sneaks in some new-wavy-sounding keyboards, a Gojira/Mastodon-esque riff, and a terrifically epic guitar solo section (where two fairly melodic, slow, and involved solos are sandwiched in between two longer and more blazing and shred-oriented solos.) The drumming is also of note in this song because it grows gradually heavier and faster the more the tune plays, and climaxes with some exceptionally deft and booming drum fills.<br /><br />Next up, \\"Honor Thy Father\\" is a much more accessible and traditional slab of heavy music. It begins by blasting off with an excellent, five-second long drum solo before settling into a lurching, bullying guitar groove (that evokes Pantera), tattooed by steady, bubbling bass notes and heavy, punching riffs.The track sneaks in some ominous, spoken word samples and chaotic, shredding guitar solos, too. But no matter how heavy and hard-rockin' \\"Honor Thy Father\\" might be, it does not totally forget about Dream Theater's melodic sensibility, as it does feature a fine bit of infectious sweep picking. And this flows perfectly into \\"Vacant,\\" a somber piano and violin-based ballad that clocks in at less than three minutes in length, making it really more of an interlude than anything else.<br /><br />And it flows right into the subsequent \\"Stream Of Consciousness,\\" which finds a nice little introductory guitar melody being smashed to bits by thunderous power chords. This entirely instrumental epic (the longest instrumental song in Dream Theater's whole discography!) is a quirky and at times even mildly funky piece, and one that comes with plenty of noodling guitar leads, sweep-picked chord progressions, and unorthodox soloing that give the tune a strong Eighties glam metal feel. And rounding out the album is \\"In The Name Of God,\\" an epically sprawling, System Of A Down-reminiscent closer. But despite being a good song, and one that has plenty of sweeping melodies, crunchy guitar licks, and flavorful guitar melodies to go around, it ultimately comes across sounding a bit tacked-on and unnecessary. And at roughly fourteen minutes in length, it is overlong, too. As such, \\"In The Name...\\" should probably have been scrapped from the record, as it does not possess much staying power or replay value.<br /><br />That slight misstep aside, though, \\"Train Of Thought\\" is a very consistent and rewarding front-to-back album. Indeed, ignore the naysayers, because \\"T.O.T.\\" is is more than worthy of being labeled another fine and all-around extremely solid effort from D.T., a band that would probably rather die (or at least dissolve) than release anything else.The track sneaks in some ominous, spoken word samples and chaotic, shredding guitar solos, too.

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is really good. only problem is it takes a long time in order to do anything. very cool
B000JMKQX0|2.0|First off, let me say that zombies are not my thing.  But I'd read the reviews describing it as a literary read, and sampled the book and thought it was interesting, so I gave it a go.<br /><br />I had to force myself through it after the first third of the book.  It was just too technical, with descriptions about the weapons used, and all the voices started to blend and sound the same after a while, so I had a hard time keeping track of who was speaking or what their background story was.  In the end, I quit making myself read it about 90% of the way through.  I just didn't care about the outcome.  My husband will read it soon, and if he likes it, I'll add to this review.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|awesome series funny dramatic sexy history buffs will get special pleasure<br /><br />filmed in picturesque locations kevin kid and many famous actors from across the pond are in this.  I just love the two nobody solders bumbling through history in a hilarious manner. added bonus if you know history, if you don't no matter you will enjoy this.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this for my wife and I can say I am not of fan of the alien franchise but my wife is and she loves this blu-ray set. I did watch the first movie with her and I can say the picture quality was actually real good compare to what it use to be but I can't say that for the movie. If you are a fan then this set is for you especially if you can pick it up for under $20 like I did then go for it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is not a bad game. there is a lot to keep up with, but the game keeps going even when you arent logged in.
B001EBWING|5.0|This movie is considered one of the greatest ever made...and there's a good reason. This is a story of love, loss, loyalty, redemption, and altruism in a world of selfishness and greed. Humphrey Bogart is perfectly cast in a stoic role with a moral dilemma, and Ingrid Bergman is one of the most beautiful people to ever be put on screen. Although not all \\"classics\\" live up to the hype, this movie deserves its reputation. Casablanca is a definite recommendation to anybody.
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|Poor acting; ridiculous script; Forrest Whitaker is just awful; a cornfield in the desert?; and apparently there are no other cops within a thousand miles of the cornfield in the desert.<br />Lousy movie.  I want my 2 hours back.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This will be your question for the most part, and why do they want him so badly? This movie is a classic with elements of mistaken-identity, spy-thriller, and romance. Eva Marie Saint is absolutely gorgeous and plays a very good double agent. Cary Grant is excellent as the protagonist and really carries the film. The twists, plot devices, and casting choices are the reasons this movie is one of the greatest ever made. North By Northwest is a definite recommendation to all.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Easy setup.  Very good with Youtube from iphone and Netflix is just OK; Google Play features are not available on iphone yet.  The disappointment is with the web streaming video thru Chrome.  This is the main reason that I bought it, and, unless you have a computer with a very fast processor, the video is choppy at best.  It does not stream from a tablet or smartphone; only from a desktop or laptop.  Hope they fix this as this feature is in beta development, but not too happy.
B001R6AW18|4.0|Considering this movie came out in 1933, wow. The special effects and the \\"realistic\\" nature of Kong in a movie made in the earliest stages of film creation is nothing short of spectacular. The story of a beauty taming a beast, and the arrogance of man trying to contain what it can't understand or control. Plus, they threw in dinosaurs to keep your attention. Good movie, especially for its age.
0064471837|5.0|I first read this book in High School. I'm a part of the Harry Potter generation and was looking for something interesting to read between books. I am so glad I found this book and the rest of the series! The entire series is so well written and keeps you reading until the very end. I can't wait for the new book Clariel to come out.<br /><br />I love this book so much that when I let my sister borrow it, and she bent the cover and ruined it, I made her buy me a new one!
B001EBWIRW|4.0|Firstly, I am not one for musicals. I was coaxed into watching this on movie night. That being said, I actually enjoyed this blast from the past. The music wasn't completely annoying as in most of the genre. Rick Moranis was very good in this movie, and I loved Levi Stubbs as the voice of Audrey II. It was funny, it was pretty original, and I didn't feel like tearing out my hair along the way (which is really saying something with a musical). Definitely recommended to adults (there is a slight amount of language probably not suitable for adolescents).
B0084B5TK8|5.0|There is a reason this classic has endured when so many others fall into oblivion.  I was glad to revisit an old friend.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|This was a great movie with an emotional spectrum ranging from end to end. At certain points you will love a character, then hate them and think them a fool. Sir Alec's Colonel Nicholson epitomizes this stance and is played perfectly by Guinness. I won't bore you by repeating details, as many reviewers have already done so. The Bridge on the River Kwai is both a classic and a masterpiece, and is definitely a must see.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Good game, it was very easy to learn, but still challenging enough to keep me interested.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes games.

B00AK57N00|3.0|It's entertaining to play this one, especially trying to get smack in the middle of the platforms with varying gravity, but it's the same all the time and get's boring quite fast...
B006OFN0SE|4.0|Although the movie didn't do well at the box office apparently, I thought it was well done and Leonardo De Caprio's interpretation of Hoover in the movie was excellent.  I've seen other portrayals and I think his was the best.  The script generally followed known historical facts about Hoover from what I've read in several biographies about him.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Pretty good way to waste time. Could use a little more explanation about some things. Kinda leaves you hanging.I'm only writing this to get a reward on the game.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It complements the earlier version with Rod Taylor and yet offers new interpretations and special effects.  The music score is great.  Although the movie did not do well at the box office, I found it worth watching.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This works well, as advertised.  Let's see, more words required.  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back./
B008JFUO36|4.0|The movie is a very imaginative science fiction entry.  Although a bit long, the acting and story line are both good and the movie is worth watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Soooooooooo addictive....love it!it is something you can just play for a long period of time. I never get bored of it. Gotta have it.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I bought this book because of the beautiful cover art by Leo and Diane Dillon and this is one of the best serendipitous book purchases ever.  Sabriel and the rest of the Abhorsen series are my old friends and every few years I re-read them.  The world building is solid and Sabriel is a good start and introduction to the Old Kingdom.  Sabriel can be read as a stand alone.  If you like stories about the undead and you're tired of reading zombie apocalypse books you'll want to read the other books in this series (Lirael ends on a bit of a cliffhanger and the storyline concludes with Abhorsen).
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game.  It keeps me busy when I have free time...but it doesn't take up every second like other games.  Would recommend this game to everyone

0064471837|4.0|Sabriel, by Garth Nix, is a unique entry in the fantasy genre, or so it seems to me. I will admit, I'm not as well-read as I could be, but I have never read anything else like Sabriel or its sequels. Nix has created a world with some really clever, original rules.<br /><br />A quick breakdown of those rules: Sabriel takes place in two countries. One of these, Ancelstierre, is quite like our own early 20th-century Europe. The other, the Old Kingdom, is more reminiscent of medieval Europe and unlike Ancelstierre, is rife with magic. The two meet at a border demarcated by the Wall, where magic begins to grow weaker the farther one travels toward Ancelstierre until eventually it ceases to exist at all.<br /><br />Magic is divided into two types: Charter Magic, governed by \\"The Charter,\\" and Free Magic, which exists outside the Charter. Generally, those who use Free Magic are unscrupulous people or creatures. Free Magic is used by necromancers, who can travel between Life and Death and control the spirits of the Dead. Only one person has the abilities of a necromancer while also abiding by the Charter - the Abhorsen, whose duty it is to protect Life and the Living from the Dead and their vassals.<br /><br />Sabriel takes a little while to really pick up the pace. The downside of having created such robust rules for his world is that Nix must take a lot of time explaining how they work for the audience's benefit. The protagonist, the titular Sabriel, acts as a convenient audience stand-in, as she lived most of her life in Magic-less Ancelstierre and so is only cursorily familiar with how things work in the Old Kingdom.<br /><br />Once a good deal of the exposition is out of the way, however, Sabriel really takes off. The plot is engaging and well-paced, with moments of high action punctuated by creepy tension. The characters are well-developed with their own distinct personalities. They fit into some archetypes while breaking free of others. The result is that they mesh with fantasy genre enough for the reader to be comfortable but aren't the same tired faces that have been seen so many times before. The world in which they exist is similar; it feels like a perversion of a typical fantasy world, but not so twisted that I wanted to reject it outright. Rather, I was drawn in, disarmed by the differences enough that much of the book was able to take me by surprise.<br /><br />That isn't to say the book completely surprised me. I gave it four stars out of five for a reason. Some of the major secrets of the book, people's identities and such, were pretty easy for me to pick up. So easy that when the reveal rolled around, there wasn't even a feeling of smugness that I solved the puzzle early.<br /><br />Overall, Sabriel presents a unique and engaging world, a generally exciting plot, and lovely, well-developed characters, though it suffers from slow pacing early on and can be predictable at times.<br /><br />One last note: the cover art for the U.S. edition (I don't know if it's different in other places) is lovely. I worked in a children's library in high school, and I remember being quite struck by it on those occasions when I had to shelve the book.ith fantasy genre enough for the reader to be comfortable but aren't the same tired faces that have been seen so many times before.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Surprisingly... this game is really cool. It reminds me of when me and my sister's and brothers use to just battle each other with the cards. It's really fun to go against other people and enjoy yourself. This also really good for when you're bored, it's really fun it's worth downloading. If you liked uno before, you'll love it more now. Enjoy!!! :)

0783226888|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. I would def. recommend you at least see this movie once.  Buy it!
B00628RFPM|5.0|I love this movie!  I show it to my students every year when we learn about the Holocaust.  In their minds, they don't see how it affected everyone, or how people could have thought that way with the mob mentality.  This movie gives them insight into what it may have been for a child during that time period and allows them to see that children are not exempt from the horrors of history.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting mix of history and fiction. Tough to following you don't devote consecutive reading days to this story of mystery, murder and love.
B001AUKUTU|4.0|This is far from Dio's best, but it's still a fairly decent album & well worth the paltry $5..even if just to fill in the gaps of your Dio collection.

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Apart from knowing this movie will be sad in the end, we really enjoyed it, but you have to be in the  mood.  It is extremely moving. It is well acted and believable.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|This film was a delightful adaptation of a most entertaining play. Whedon captures the screwball nature of Beatrice and Benedick's romance, as well as the dark thread that is the Hero and Claudio plot. Very approachable for Shakespeare, the dialogue is generally fairly straightforward to follow. Terrific performances. It is astounding that so much could be achieved on the barest minimum budget and in such a tight timescale. It was filmed in 12 days with little longer than that in preparation. One of the leads was only signed on the day before filming began and had to master his lines and performance between shooting. Unbelievably good in those circumstances!<br />Watch it. You won't regret it.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I heard that this was an inspirational book but some of the continual repetition of phrases was a bit irritating. However searching for something elusive in life which can be found where you started from is very true and I think the meaning of this book.

B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Jake Bugg is musically wise beyond his years.<br /><br />Whether or not he has studied great music in order to put together such a great sound as he has does not matter.  But for those of you who haven't heard him, his debut album contains flashes of Everly Brothers, Bob Dylan, and David Gray... all infused with youthful energy, beautiful singing, and lyrics that are not only clever but mature for someone his age.<br /><br />The lyrics to \\"Simple As This\\" (a wonderful love song) are the sorts of words songwriters three times Bugg's age are hard pressed to come up with.  \\"Lightning Bolt\\" is a jumping tune that may be about dealing with the moment, and the gorgeous \\"Broken\\" is simply poetry.<br /><br />All in all, the album is a great first step in what promises to be a nice career, and it is inspiring to hear the enthusiasm and care with which this young man approaches his craft.  I am pretty sure Jake Bugg's lightning bolt will be more than just lightning in a bottle.
B00ABMZRVO|4.0|This is a story of a true love when one person is a drug addict and the other in a promising career and trying to deal with their great love for the addicted person. It eventually comes down to rehab and making a decision that not only will change your life but to rid yourself of the poison people in your relationships even though you truly love them. This is a straight from the shoulder movie that I am sure plays itself over and over in many relationships and certainly in gay ones. Worth the watch.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was my first Gaiman read so I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised at his story telling skills.  His characters were compelling, themes engaging, context interesting, and the setting appealing.  Not a book I'd read again but certainly worth some of my vacation time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series so full of suspense, among other things.  I can say it will definitely hold your interest and keep you wanting more.  So looking forward to the next book.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I rate it five stars because I like movies that make you think ahead, or think about whats going on behind the scenes.  I just feel like I think like the character in the movie does as I was telling my wife what I thought was going on just before Reacher would. Acting was good and Cruise made it all believable.  However, the baseball bat to the back of the head would have done a lot more damage....

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel by Garth Nix is the first of three books dedicated to a fantastical realm that you need to enter.<br /><br />The story begins in the Old Kingdom, a kind of medieval place, where a man is fighting against an evil. Within those first few pages you see there is magic and lore and miracles happening, including the birth of a baby, brought back to life from death apparently.<br /><br />As the chapters progress, you see that there is an Abhorsen, a magic user whom channels the ancient powers to control the dead spirits, sometimes of dead people, sometimes of beings that never walked the earth. If you thought the 2013 movie, The Conjuring was a nice dip into the occult and that other world that is all around us, then you would appreciate the job of the Abhorsen, the chosen family that sheriffs those that are on the other side and protects the rest of us from them.<br /><br />Sabriel, the title character, is a young woman that grew up on the other side of this world, in Ancelstierre, where technology and the modern world is. A wall separates the two sides. Sabriel is the daughter of the current Abhorsen, and when he sends a book and bells to Sabriel, she knows something's happened to her father, and she needs to go home, and possibly be the next in the long line of Abhorsens.<br /><br />The Abhorsens regulate the dead spirits and other spirits through the ringing of bells. As necromancer tools, the bells channel magical powers to call and send spirits to wherever the bell ringers choose, but they can be dangerous, because your own spirit can be sent into the underworld if you aren't careful. Beyond that there are other more nefarious necromancers that are working for those evils spirits that want to breach into the living world, working against our protagonist.<br /><br />The first book starts the journey into this world. Two more books help us dive deeper into this world. Soon Garth Nix will present us with yet more full novels in the world of the Old Kingdom. I personally look forward to it.<br /><br />If you love movies about spirits and hauntings, if you like books about magic and modern technology seamlessly woven together, if you want a good story to encapsulate your life for the next few weeks, start off with Sabriel by Garth Nix. You will not go wrong.rsonally look forward to it.<br /><br />If you love movies about spirits and hauntings, if you like books about magic and modern technology seamlessly woven together, if you want a good story to encapsulate your life for the next few weeks, start off with Sabriel by Garth Nix.

B00BRUYQFC|4.0|On his first release in seven years, Timberlake has created an amazing album that shows an artist can take a break and come back with ease. The album opens up with the Prince insipried Pusher Love Girl, followed by the lead single Suit & Tie. The rest of the album is a mixture of pop and R&B sounding grooves. I'm not really partial to the pop stuff on the album (Mirros) but the R&B stuff more than makes up for it, in particualar Starwberry Bubblegum and Spaceship Coupe which are remsicent of the eighties production work of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, as well as the Curtis Mayfield esque That Girl. All in all this is a fine album from one of the best performers in music today.

0143123173|4.0|I'm one of those late arrivals to the Craig Johnson party. For some time I had seen his books at bookstores but since I don't typically go for westerns, I never considered reading one of them . . . until Longmire--the A&E series based on Johnson's books. The TV series has gotten better and better as it's progressed and it eventually convinced me to check out the books. The Cold Dish is the second book I've read, but it was the first one written.<br /><br />A few years before the story in The Cold Dish begins, a young Cheyenne girl was violated by a group of teenage boys. Sheriff Walt Longmire led the investigation which had eventually led to the boys' arrests, but the judicial system failed and the boys each got off with a slap on the wrist. The book begins with the discovery of a body up in the Big Horn mountains of Wyoming. The body is that of a young man who had been shot with a high-powered rifle. It's Cody Pritchard, the leader of the group of boys who had raped the Cheyenne girl years ago.<br /><br />Once again it's Walt, who along with his deputy Victoria and his friend Henry Standing Bear who have to find out who killed Cody. The list of possible suspects is quite long, but when a second boy from the group is killed by the same weapon and only a few days later, the case takes on a whole new sense of urgency as it becomes clear to Walt that revenge is being exacted and he must stop it before the remaining two boys lose their lives as well.<br /><br />Right before reading this book I attended a book signing event for his latest book and was able to listen to him talk about both the books and his involvement in the TV series. I was thoroughly impressed with the man. He is funny, gregarious, boisterous, and obviously a very intelligent and well-read guy. It was obvious from listening to him that he has a great love for the part of the country he lives in and which he uses as almost another character in his writing.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I am not much of a Tom Cruise fan, but he did a pretty good job in this one. The special effects were top notch. Definitely a movie that I have to add to my DVD library.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Kudos to John Green for \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\". I've read quite a few books in my time and I can honestly say that I've never been more emotionally attached to a character as I was Hazel. John Green writes with so much passion and emotion that you  fall into Hazel's journey with her. The standpoint of illness he perceives is something completely new. You find yourself not feeling sorry Hazel, but pushing her to fight rather. I would recommend this book to all ages and gender. It'll warm your heart one chapter, then have you crying like a baby the next!!

B000W2GH4Y|5.0|THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can.<br /><br />Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence. On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in. And on another note, Sydney Pollack once more proves he was on of the cinema's best directors.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House is one of those historical fiction novels that truly gives the reader a look into antebellum southern plantation life.  The format of switching back and forth from two characters narrating the story gives two different perspectives during this time period.  One of the narrators is a slave girl who works in the kitchen house and is the daughter of the master of the plantation.  The other narrator is an Irish indentured servant girl.<br />  An excellent read up until the last fourth of the book, when it seemed the author rushed through to the end.  The end seemed to leave the story open -- possibly for a sequel to be written later.
B008JFUPZI|4.0|Interesting film depending how you look at it. This is not necessarily original or innovative film making. Yet, the characters sketched out save this film. There is good acting here.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel (and Nix's other works) usually get shelved in the Young Adult section, placed next to the other books marketed towards girls. This is a mistake, as Garth Nix's book is well-written and engaging enough that you don't need to be female or teenaged to enjoy the twilight world that Sabriel, the title character and heroine, stumbles into defending. The pacing is constant and absorbing, as Nix doesn't fall into the common fantasy trap of explaining the vaaaast history and geography of his world. Instead, he does exactly what a writer should - by showing the reading important snippets here and there in the action, we learn organically about the world, the villains, and what Sabriel must do to save it.<br /><br />One word of warning: Read Sabriel, and you'll inevitably end up reading everything else Nix has written, and he will leave you wanting much, much more.

It was well crafted, extremely well written and thought provoking, good as a mystery and even way better as a character study and even philosophical reflection on human relationships in general. I just loved this book, it goes way beyond the thrilled aspect, it is genuinely a GOOD BOOK. Could turn into a classic for all I know.<br />Now, Sharp Objects was... a disappointment. I had read many reviews before ordering and was ready to put up with the unlikable characters, the sketchy plot, the twisted scheme. What I was not prepared for was HOW unlikable the characters actually are, pretty much all of them. I think the only character I could feel any empathy for was the father of one of the victims.<br />Anyway, as a whodunnit, Sharp Objects is very flawed, not all that interesting, not all that recommendable. However, as a study of human character, it is still worthy of reading, as there are a few gems here and there. Ms Flynn has unique and very intriguing views on feminism that, as a female myself, I find deeply interesting. She also dissects man/woman relationship in a very interesting (if not all that optimistic) ways. Last but not least, she writes quite well, her prose has beautiful moments, and she has a real personal style, that seems neither copied nor overdone, just hers, and very good.<br />So overall I wouldn't rate Sharp Objects very high as a thriller, and can't say I even enjoyed it much as a book, but I still wish I had the patience to endure it again and re-read it to be able to better digest those few nuggest of both wisdom and litterature that are scattered across this otherwise rather unpleasant piece of work. Some reviewers have stated (globally) that book is sick. It's not. It talks of how humans are sick. That's an important difference.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a masterpiece of world-building, so real it feels as though I've lived in Sabriel's world and know it as intimately as she does. Garth Nix skillfully weaves both a believable and real world together with characters full of depth and humanity. From page one I was invested in the plot and compelled by the characters and Sabriel's quest. A thrilling read which I recommend without reservation.

B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This game is fun and addicting, HOWEVER, it would be a lot better if it had better directions. I don't know how to do parts of the game and not sure why I win stars when I do. It would be a lot better if they included directions that explained details of the game.
B00014NE62|5.0|If you are, like me, one of the rare true romantics in the world, this film will blow you away.  Set in turn of the century Britain, when it was truly difficult to be gay or out.  Maurice mixes tales of elitism, difference in societal classes, crushes, love and more.  Maurice is an upper class young gay man who attends an elite university, where schoolboy crushes are one thing, but gay love is well, quite different.  He tries to make his way and weather life's storms and disappointments.  I hesitate to give too many specifics as I don't want to spoil the story for anyone.  What I will say is that the final scene and the last line will hit you right in the heart. Simply a wonderful expression of love.  You really shouldn't miss this one!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Wish the rounds didn't send you back to square one when you fail. Glad I paid to unlock all of the levels.Just bounce around when I get bored of failing at one level.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This film blew my mind when I first saw it as I don't think there's ever been anything quite like it.  I know that John Cameron Mitchell said in interviews he wanted to create a film that had graphic sex but also a complex plot and I do believe he succeeded.  A complex tale with interweaving stories involving love and the search for sexual satisfaction.  This film is funny, moving, happy, bleak, sexy, gross and more, depending on the point you're at in the plot.<br />Most of the performers are quite attractive and enjoyable to watch, and most are also good actors.  The film can be quite mysterious and unique at times, and will give you much to think about.  This is one of those unsettling movies that stayed with me for days.  But ultimately, I felt it was life affirming and an excellent adventure.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Really great movie after an awesome series ended. it wraps it up well even though your heart will break a tiny bit. DVD came in great condition, and shipped quickly. love it :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome  because you could go to options and you could type your name.Also you could change it to easy or hard.
B000O599ZS|5.0|An almost unanimous top 5 pick of all-time best westerns and most top 20 films ever made, &#34;The Searchers&#34; is what you expect from a western; cowboys, Indians, bad guys and good guys, lots of action and shooting. It is also a dark movie, showing the journey of a man coming to terms with the value of a person beyond just their experience. A John Ford/John Wayne collaboration, it is, as all Ford movies are, beautifully shot in Monument Valley, the scenery that comes to most people's minds when they think of westerns.<br /><br />John Wayne plays a Civil War veteran whose niece is kidnapped by  a Comanche raiding party. Wayne sets out to get her back. As time goes on, the dynamic changes from one of rescuing the niece (played by Natalie Wood) to a situation where Wayne decides the best outcome is that they find her and put her out of her misery. Yep. With an injection of lead. The kind that comes in different calibers.<br /><br />Wayne's determination in the face of time, arrows and lead and even threats that Woods' brother will kill him if he hurts her is incredibly cold and stoic, not necessarily the tough-guy, wise-cracking hero from his other movies. It is an amazing performance from an under-rated star.<br /><br />If you like westerns, you'll love this movie, and if you love movies, you'll love this movie. And you will probably want to own it, as it holds up to many repeat viewings.<br /><br />After this Wayne movie, you may want to try &#34;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&#34;, &#34;Red River&#34;, or &#34;The Shootist&#34;. Clint Eastwood's &#34;The Outlaw Josie Wales&#34; and &#34;Unforgiven&#34; are other worthy titles for your attention.<br /><br />Cheers!
B001N8V7KA|5.0|GREAT EASTWOOD MOVIE! GREAT ACTOR! SOME SCENES A LITTLE FAR FETCHED! THE BEGINNING WAS A LITTLE HAZY, BUT EASTWOOD CAN OVERCOME THAT AS HE IS A GREAT ACTOR!!
1250029465|5.0|This poignant and uplifting story reminded me of just how powerful the bond between humans and animals can be. This redemptive tale of life on the streets, drug addiction, and the healing power of love, is all at once entertaining, informative, and humorous. A great summer read and highly recommended. My love goes out to Bob the Cat, and all animals who embody unconditional love, and teach us the path to our own humanity and authenticity!! Long live Nandhi, The Buddha's Dog!!

0064471837|5.0|SABRIEL has been one of my all-time favorites since I was a young teenager. It follows an eighteen year old protagonist through a coming of age tale full of adventure and magic. I would say that the underlying theme of this novel is about finding one's self under pressure and in the shadow of those who have come before. I think it is a fantastic read for mature pre-teens and teenagers. I am also of the opinion that this book is not limited to a female audience, as many novels with female main characters are. My husband has been reading this book slowly over the course of the year and is thoroughly enjoying the action and tension of the plot.<br /><br />If you are looking for a unique fantasy novel in the supernatural and sorcery craze that is currently popular in bookstores, SABRIEL is something you want to check out. Overall, this is a fantastic read for fantasy lovers, young or old.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading the reviews of angry readers, I was hesitant to purchase and read, though I have been waiting for months! I have to say I am so glad I did! I loved it!!! I am actually excited to know that this was not the end of Gideon and Eva. There will be at least 1 more book, and I read that there is talk of a TV show! Not sure how they will pull off all of Eva and Gideon's heat, but I will for sure watch! This book shows you just how much Gideon loves Eva and is willing to do ANYTHING to keep her safe. It also shows how much Eva trusts him, and accepts all of him. I definetly enjoyed this book and recommend all the other Crossfire Novel readers read and again wait for the next book. Sylvia Day has yet to disappoint!
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Awesome action picture. Some might think it is corny at times but I think it has a real touch of realism.
B00COCY67A|2.0|Oh boy! Anybody who is a serious Elvis fan knows that the Stax sessions were the beginning of the end. Mediocre is being too kind to these tunes.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast has made home entertainment even more convenient. Watching YouTube and Netflix has never been easier. The ability to &#34;cast&#34; a tab from Chrome was a nice surprise, but it is still in beta so it was a bit janky with some websites. The setup could not have been any easier. Tried it on dekstops, laptops, and tablets with great results.

0064471837|5.0|This book was the book that got me into reading Garth Nix. His writing style is amazing, his characters are all very strong. He took death and necromancy and made it something different than any one out there. The books are great for older people and younger teens,

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the first book in an inspiring trilogy that transports you into a world of magic, mystery and a great number of things that would otherwise not be offered to us in the real world; but the writer also never lets you forget that there is a real world (or what in the book is our real world circa 1915) and in a sense that is the underline concept of the book! As Sabriel stands on line that separates the old kingdom from \\"The real world\\" or the line that separates life from death, you as the reader stand on the edge of the world you want to poor yourself into and the world you are reading the book to escape. As a side note, if you are interested in the book on audio, Tim Curry does an amazing job reading all three of the books in the trilogy. I have read them all multiple times since I was 15, and now at the age of 27 I will still throw the cds in just to listen to the story if I can't still down with one of the books!
0064471837|5.0|In my adolescent years I lived in a smallish town with a small but decent library. All year round, but especially in the summer I would read, a lot. Like a book every day or two. I lost track of how many times I have taken this book out from that library and have read it now that I have a copy of my own.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, the characters are the kind that stay with you. When I was a young girl, Sabriel was an inspiration to me. She was strong and capable even after a somewhat sheltered upbringing. I found Mogget a riot and Touchstone's mystery very compelling. As for the setting, Ancelstierre acts a nice bridge between our reality and the Old Kingdom. And though I had never heard of a necromancer before this book (I think I broke out my dictionary and looked it up all those years ago.), I have read a fair few books and played a fair few games that feature them since and this has always been the most unique take on them I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have a daughter now, and I cannot wait until the day she is old enough to sit down and enjoy the book she got her name from. (She hasn't got the patience for books without pictures at the moment.) My only regret is that I bought the soft cover edition. But one of these days I'll likely buy a hardcover copy and pass the softcover down to her. This book is totally worth purchasing a second copy of. And my lucky little girl won't have to wait years to read the rest of the series!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I finally got around to reading LITTLE WOMEN and don't quite know what to say. I had not been clear on the fact that it takes place during the Civil War and came out in 1868, a long, long time ago. It follows the growing up of four young Yankee girls, showing their altered circumstances over about a decade, from marriage to other fates. What stands out for me now in 2013 is how preachy the intruding author is, quite treacly at times, with all that gushing over domestic pleasures and babies who talk baby-talk till you want to run away. It's not that I don't like domestic pleasures, but books like LITTLE WOMEN set up expectations that I believe are rarely realized in actual life, and people are better off not being misled by false expectations. (It's a kind of porn of sentimentality.)<br />  What can't fail to jump out at the contemporary reader is that Jo, the character Louisa May Alcott modeled on herself, is a butch lesbian and nobody seems to notice. Every other speech from her lips is about wanting to \\"be a guy\\" or how \\"manly\\" she is is. Maybe she's even trans! In 1868 she is just a \\"tomboy.\\" Maybe you're a \\"tombody\\" at fourteen, but at nineteen you're a lesbian. (She's also a nice lesbian.) She is married off to a German professor in the novel, conveniently conventional. In real life, Louisa May never married.<br />  The plot sometimes stalls or is too episodic for its own good, mixed in with all those homilies, but overall the book has enough life in it to illuminate a world<br />150 years ago that makes up aware of what they knew then and what we may know now.<br />Now is better.

B00992CF6W|5.0|its a very good game like once you play<br />it you'll get addicted to<br />if I got this game this would be my birthday present.
0064471837|5.0|A friend gave me this book. She had bought the paperback because she liked the cover art, but she had never gotten around to reading it. Her impulse buy was a happy accident for me, since I not only loved the story, but have gone back to reread it many times over the years. When I was a teenager, I admired Sabriel's hyper-capability, her confidence and her cool head in a crisis. She seemed like everything I wanted to be. Now that I'm in my mid-twenties, I can see that Sabriel is not always sure of herself. She makes mistakes, but she is ultimately rewarded for the risks she takes.<br /><br />I was also deeply drawn to the world building in this series. Garth Nix has created a unique and fully-fleshed setting in Ancelsteirre and The Old Kingdom. Upon first reading I was fascinated by the strange, conflicting cultures and magical rules. Now, with a decade of fantasy reading under my belt, I can appreciate even more how refreshing these books are. I've never found anything quite like them again.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Since I enjoy the TV series, I thought the book would be interesting. Does not follow the TV series as well as I would like, but it was still a good book. The story was complicated enough to keep me reading.  Will try some of his other books in the same genre.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|These Wubbanub pacifiers are permanently attached to what appears to be Philips AVENT Soothie. The only pacifiers she likes are the ones made of the soft silicone, and having one attached to a plush toy gives her the ability to put it back into her mouth on her own before she develops the dexterity to put a regular pacifier back in her mouth. Since we bought this, we are awakened much less in the middle of the night!
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Sebastian is book two in The Three Nations trilogy, but a reader could pick up this one first...it has a completely different cast of characters and in fact is set during WW1...before the first book, which is set during WW2.<br /><br />Sebastian is the \\"crippled\\" son of a frail and fearful mother, Vera. His grandparents are sickly and broken. His dad is the strong one of the family, at least until he gets sent off to war. In my opinion, Sebastian is the strongest and most emotionally healthy members of his circle...so it's with irony that we note his disability.<br /><br />The story is about Sebastian's family and its extended circle - and of course the political ramifications of different ethnic backgrounds in early 20th century Europe. A few of the characters are rather awful people (but they're fun to read about), and several are perfectly charming. Every one is a mix of conflict, joy, insecurities, doubt, frailty, strength, and personal preference. This author's talent - in my view - is the way he gets in those characters' heads and invites us in too. We're treated to all those feelings - the good, the bad, and the constantly changing. I love that.<br /><br />There is also a history lesson going on here, so if you need to brush up on that without getting bogged down by dry dates and facts that have no humanity attached to them - I recommend this book. Very much. Suitable for mature teens - up.<br /><br />Of course, when book three comes out, I'll grab it immediately.
0679721037|5.0|The quote is not mine.  It's from the front cover of the First Vintage Books edition (© 1989) I just read.  But I borrowed another's quote because I couldn't have said it better.<br /><br />I realize that John Hersey is a name few people under 60 will recognize.  In my late teenage years, his was a name to be reckoned with.  A BELL FOR ADANO and WHITE LOTUS are titles I still carry in my petrified memory.  And after (finally) getting around to reading HIROSHIMA, I know why.<br /><br />HIROSHIMA is pure journalism -- make no mistake about it.  But it's journalism with integrity.  It's journalism in which the writer has put himself aside, and accurately reported.  Since he, personally, wasn't there the day the bomb dropped, he reported what he found out first-hand from survivors -- about both the players and the props upon that dreadful stage.<br /><br />John Hersey was from the old school of journalism -- which is to say, he reported accurately, without embellishment, without hyperbole, without slant.  The story of Hiroshima doesn't need embellishment, hyperbole or slant.  The story of Hiroshima (and Nagasaki) is monolithic.<br /><br />You might well read Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE and be as swayed by its message.  But for that, you'd need at least a couple of weeks (if you're lucky), a couple of months (if you're not).  HIROSHIMA is something you can read in a couple of days.  I know.  I did.  And yes, \\"everyone able to read should read it.\\"<br /><br />RRB<br />8/07/13<br />Brooklyn, NY

0064471837|5.0|I  came upon Sabriel by mistake as I had already bought Lirael not realising it was the second book of three so of course I had to buy the first one.  I had to give this book 5 Stars because the excellent storyline is unique, the characters are well rounded and the writing is excellent.  I am looking forward to reading Clariel but will probably read the first three books again before I read the latest instalment.  So much to look forward to!
B005LAII4E|1.0|*Sigh*... Much in the same way the Mission Impossible movies quickly became all about Tom Cruise, GI Joe looks like it's becoming all about the Rock.  It isn't about the team, it's about the individual... and the hot chick that follows him, of course, whose only inclusion is to flaunt her body to sucker in the bad guys.  Seriously?  GI Joe: Retaliation started out strong but quickly fizzled out after the first ten minutes or so.  The plot lines seemed rushed, the set-up inexplicably complicated for the short time their crammed in, yet the resolutions so sudden and simple that they may as well have been left out.  I can appreciate a nod to the fans and the backstories, but don't jam it awkwardly in just for lack of enough actual story to make a movie.  The stories are thrust at the audience without even a pretense of mystery, without experiencing the journey of discovery with the characters.  Cobra was just sort of phoned in.  World domination, okay, fine, whatever.  This movie is juvenile in the sense that it could have been a good movie, but instead wandered off into the realm of underdeveloped plots, shallow characters, and the continuous questions of \\"When did that happen and why didn't anyone notice?\\"  There are a lot of these questions presented, particularly about Cobra, that are never even attempted to be accounted for.  They have the technology, they have the guy on the inside, they always have their minions fully armed and prepaired to take control, and no one ever suspects something is amiss except for our main characters.  That's just the way it is, no explainations offered.  It expects its audience as well as its characters to shrug their collective shoulders at the presented story and say \\"Sure, why not?  Let's just go with that.\\"  A good movie -- whether made for kids or adults -- involves the viewer in the journey and growth of its characters.  This movie doesn't even try.  Granted this wasn't made to be an Oscar-winning movie, nor would it ever be mistaken as such.<br /><br />  Sure, the action was decent and the 3D was okay, but not enough to call it a \\"fun\\" movie worth watching more than once.  And why base a new movie on a franchise that has been around for DECADES only to completely change it with only the names of characters to lend any resemblence to the original?  If so much is changed to the point of the new having little or nothing akin to the old, (like killing off a main character, for instance) then why not just create something entirely original?  Could it be that if not for the love of those of us who grew up with GI Joe, it's likely no one would ever watch a movie like this let alone give it a good review?  It has nothing to give it any merit save its affiliation with and capitalizaion on a beloved childhood memory.  I'm so disappointed in these movies now, I don't even want to see the third one when it comes out.  The 3D and PG-rated action isn't worth sitting through the absurd plot or bad acting.<br /><br />But then, I hated the new Star Trek movie as well for what was done to the integrity of the original story and characters so painstakingly established and belovedly familiar, so....  If you liked that, you'll probably like this.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I loved being able to watch this series on Amazon Prime!  Makes my prime membership totally worth every penny! YAY
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Wow. You never realize how perfectly normal you are until you read a Flynn novel. Love her characters and the depth she gives them.
0064471837|5.0|.. is indeed a very dark one,inhabited by dead creatures and Sabriel,<br />a girl that has to dispel them back into the world of death where they belong.<br />When compared to other Fantasy series, this one stands out for its much more intricate storylines and its<br />interesting characters that don't merely stay between the pages of a book but come to live.<br />Having read Sabriel for the first time as a young teenager, I have reread the Abhorsen trilogy<br />multiple times and each time have found it captivating me again with its verious charms.<br />Considering that I have so far only read the German translation (being from Germany), I actually<br />just ordered the English version in order to read it the way it was written and am very much<br />looking forward to that.<br />Do not hesitate if thinking about buying this book for yourself or a teenager you know -<br />it will be a great choice!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This. book has a pretty realistic outlook on the world if it ever went through and survived a zombie apocalypse
0240808452|5.0|Fantastic insights into motion and how to understand it before you can put it down on paper.
B005CYLG5W|5.0|Roxy Music is sexy music period.  An old concert on Blu-ray a bit grainy, no Hi-def sound... but it is simply awesome to watch and hear for anybody who likes Roxy Music.  What a great show, throw your arm over your girl friend of wife on the couch and the sparks will fly!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|A good treatment of the game. If you are patient, you will not need to purchase any decks!  Highly recommended, witness this is the only review I've taken time to write!!
0064471837|5.0|This was one of the first books I read as a teenager that my Dad who was a huge reader had not recommended to me and it remains an absolute classic in my eyes. The writing is elegant with the author managing not avoid one of the chief pitfalls of fantasy writing : avoiding showing off his world building too much. There is just enough of what is a wonderfully unique world to drive the story without smothering it in detailed explanations which must have been tempting because Garth Nix has clearly thought through his back-story. The characters hang together brilliantly with special mention going to mogget who does enigmatic brilliantly. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|All I can say is I'm soooooooooooooooooooooo happy I got this the day after it came out for $35. Now the price has doubled! This thing is awesome. I stream Netflix right through my iPad so now I can watch movies in my bedroom.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I love all the songs!  I have played it over and over.  The song with him and Dolly Parton is my favorite one.  I would love to see them perform this in person.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom Keifer has such a beautiful,sultry and bluesy voice. This album is great! I am so glad he is healthy and back to making music!!
B002GHHHL0|5.0|Good movie, I love shark movies, Jaws being my favorite and this was a really good one. Definitely worth watching.
1451695195|4.0|It confirmed my belief that there is life  without pain after we leave our earthly being.  Medical terminology required consulting the dictionary
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Truly a book for the fans of Jack Reacher.  Since I picked up the first one year back I look forward to all the books.  This one is awesome in the same style that Lee Child presents his main character.  I am not going to spill any clues but I could not put id down.  Needless to say a lot of short sleep nights....
0439023513|5.0|MOCKINGJAY (Pub. 2010) by Suzanne Collins is the third book in the Hunger Games trilogy and is the most heart-wrenching of the three books.<br /><br />Unlike the first two books, which both feature Katniss fighting for her life during the Games, Mockingjay is about the actual war between the Capitol and the District rebels.  Although Katniss sees it as ultimately being another form of the Games, she takes part in fighting the Capitol, which she's resented from page one.<br /><br />I've read reviews and heard people say they didn't like the third book as well as the first two.  I felt the same way the first time I read the trilogy.  I've read it a second time now, devouring the books once again in a matter of a few days.  After the second reading, I am much more impressed by Mockingjay, and even more so by the author's incredible talent.<br /><br />What I like best about this third book, outside of the story itself, is how much it makes a person stop and really think about their actions, and the actions and true motivations of the politicians in the world, and those who go along with their plans.<br /><br />As a fellow writer, I am completely in awe of Collins deft ability to cover all the bases throughout the trilogy, while keeping me absolutely fascinated with the story.  The author uses devices we writers have at hand, but in a seamless way that is completely organic to the story.<br /><br />For example, Collins finds a way to refresh the reader on events that occurred in the first two books, (which is somewhat of a prerequisite for trilogies) in a way that flows with what is happening in the present.  In a scene that occurs on pages 74-76 (hardback version), Haymitch is asking the gathered group of victors and prep crew to give him examples of times when Katniss did something that truly moved them. He goes around the room and writes down the examples given by the individuals present.  This not only reminds us of past events, but serves to further deepen how muchwe care for Katniss.<br /><br />The first time I read Mockingjay, I found myself thinking the trilogy should have ended on a brighter note.  But after completing this second read, the ending came across differently for me. Not quite so sad, and more a feeling of it ending the way it had to. And once again, completely impressed by the author.<br /><br />I could go on and on with other examples of how impressed I am with Collins writing skills.  Suffice it to say, I think she is largely unsung by the general public because everyone focuses on the incredible story itself, which is just another indicator of how truly talented this author is.<br /><br />It's been twenty-plus years since I've read a story that had such a lingering impact, with the story still on my mind days after closing the book.  This trilogy is firmly at the top of my all-time-favorite books list, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't discovered this trilogy yet.  Do yourself a favor and get all three books in hand before you start reading...otherwise you'll find yourself scrambling madly to get your hands on the next volume.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book years after it came out.  But I could never forget this and the second book.  I would like a speaker of the dead at my funeral.  But this book is more than science fiction as it is based on many other ideas of great writers.  Worth reading again as its an easy read but it brings back many memories....
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|I love these vinyl figures. They are absolutely adorable and make great gifts.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase Funko POP figures.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book is intense and thought-provoking. While it gives credibility to the Bible, it wants to include all faiths and  philosophies.  Don't take it too seriously; however, there is a new  mystery  on  every  page, so remains intriguing!<br />A must read.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I tried to resist watching... I knew I would be hooked! So many stories to get involved with, something for everyone.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|As a middle aged man with a long-time love of science fiction, Old Man's War is one of my favorites. The clever premise, clear prose, and subtle humor all combine into a thoroughly pleasurable read. This is my second time reading this novel and I found myself trying to delay reading it straight through (like I did the first time).
B00DI75SWM|4.0|Its really good, besides that you can't add your own photo at the top from you device :  besides that, pretty good, you should get it.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|The author clearly states his ideas, gives great examples, and backs it up with PLENTY of research. If you're in the hunt for a lifestyle change that will improve your health, alleviate stress, and heighten your well being, give this a read.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I'm stuck on level 29 and I can't seem to get past it at all. It's a great game  but can someone please write a review on how to beat it? I really want to keep playing! Addicting game!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Yes, I'm a runner.  I can't stand ear buds, since they don't really stay in my ears while I'm sitting at my office desk, much less running.  I needed an affordable, lightweight alternative, and these are PERFECT.  I have been using these for YEARS (literally, since I ran cross country in high school over 10 years ago) and am glad to see that I can still find them here at Amazon.  Definitely my go-to.  No, they don't last forever, but they're so affordable and practical that they're worth it to keep buying over and over!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! It is wonderful and exciting. It's similar to temple run but wayyyy better!! I love it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. There were many unexpected twists that were expertly woven to keep me reading and reading. It was a really good story about a marriage gone very wrong. I recommend it.
B008MM9630|2.0|This game is so adorable and  entertaining...however.... I have had to re install it three times! Some of the quests can only be completed if you buy things. One quest I couldn't complete because some  items were missing from the game....just sad really because otherwise it would be awesome
B00174TKGI|1.0|Wasted my money. The so called instant video would never load kept saying connection error. I was ripped off I will never order again
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|You can't do anything but view youtube videos on both the iPad and iPhone! It claims you can do so much but don't believe the false advertising.  If you're apple, don't waste the money, it's only for android.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Hard to just echo what everyone else is saying, but it's true.  That was one great movie!  The plot was a little hard to follow, and I had to back it up once or twice to catch up with what was happening.  Whew, and wow too.  Mind blowing twists and turns, and then a fantastic ending.  I hardly ever am moved to write a review, but for some reason I wanted to for this film.  I give it very high recommendations.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Those giving Nichols' latest film poor reviews must be those who found films like Mall Cop to be entertaining.  \\"Mud\\" is a rich and complex narrative that movies slowly at first.  The influence of William Faulkner, Mark Twain, and Cormac McCarthy is most obvious in the script's slow unfurling but it is no way a fault.  All three authors have a rich talent of developing sophisticated and complex characters with sparing dialogue.  Nichols does not differ from that style in his own writing.  Although Mud (McConaughey) is the title character he is by no means the protagonist; Ellis (Tye Sheridan) steals the story.  Ellis' teen love affair and its intensity mirrors that of Mud and Juniper(Witherspoon) but is not ready to grasp its complexity of dysfunction. On the surface, Ellis' presumed adolescent simplicity makes him a sounding board for all other relationships in the story.<br /><br />Many have billed this movie as a thriller.  It is not.  It is much deeper and profound study of human relationships and the principles that drive our actions.  It is not a quick thrill adrenaline rush like \\"The Call\\" for example.  The ending of the film is intense but if you are expecting fast-paced action this film is not in that genre.  \\"Mud\\" is a brilliant character study more akin to \\"Huck Finn\\" meets \\"Stand By Me.\\"  Nichols has created both a cinematic and budding literary masterpiece.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Sometimes the Kindle slips from its upright slanted position, especially when charging.  I like the hardcover, the closure band, color choices, & start up of Kindle when you open the case.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|OMG, I can't believe this was so popular.  We were bored stupid.  I, especially, LOVE Wicked (the book, not the musical) and The Wizard of Oz movie but this was sooooo dumb.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|I just watched this for the first time but went with the Director's Cut as I read it made an immense difference compared to the original cut.
B0092YO8C6|5.0|i  like  austin&ally  becuse  thay  are  cool  &  trish  &des  i  bet  they  are  the  best  and  i  like  your  music
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Every album has &#34;that song&#34; that gets stuck in your head and you just can't get out. While &#34;Get Lucky&#34; has been extraordinarily popular, I highly suggest getting &#34;Instant Crush&#34; stuck in your head.<br />I promise, you'll thank me later.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is legit the best thing you can get cause  my kindle fire 1st gen would never give an Indication that its charging no light at bottom or battery at the top but this said it was charging when the others were off and it really works.
B008GFI418|4.0|This is a very quiet, charming retrospective of a man's life's work.  George Martin is the central theme, as is his (still) lovely wife and there is a host of surprise guests, all meeting and having a nice &#34;visit with George&#34;.  Not a probing expose, but a look at an England now lost to history and of a man's work bringing a small record label from obscurity to the cutting edge of not only rock and roll (as it was in the beginning) but to the cutting edge of popular music as a whole.  My only wish is that George's son, who is the interviewer, could have asked more technical aspects of George's music with the Beatles-- naming the equipment used, the backwards tapes, etc.  It does go into some detail, but not as much as a person like me (I am a part-time recording engineer) would prefer. All in all, a very enjoyable retrospective.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|not sure what the significance of a more current version of the original is.  Would just as soon watch the original.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Any creative thought I have, I always go to Pinterest first for inspiration. I would recommend this app to anyone, not just for recipes and crafts but even car /motorheads. It has helped my husband out a lot as well.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth and Joe are at their Best AGAIN!! She sings all the classics with style, soul and power!!! Buy this!!!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Not a bad game. A little hard to gather gold... its slightly different than other games in how you advance...
1401301010|4.0|its in good shape can't wait to read the rest of it. i love the chili peppers i think its going to be good
B00309DC1M|5.0|I have not seen this film since I was a child, so it was a wonderful trip down memory lane for me. And my daughter loves it too! She has an Aurora Barbie and a little Sleeping Beauty book that we read, so it was a treat for her to actually see the DVD. I especially like the singing voice of Aurora, and the Three Good Fairie's personalities. The only complaint I have is that 16 years old is way too young to get married (these days, lol). Although Aurora and Phillip do not actually get married in this film, it is still talked about like they will be getting married very soon, like at age 16. Also, If you have a child who is scared of &#34;villians&#34; in stories, then the bad fairie Maleficent is pretty scary, lol, so you may want to wait until your child is older and can handle it better. Other than those two things, this is a very sweet young love story of a prince and princess who fall for each other, when they don't even know they are betrothed to one another already. And what the prince endures to save the princess from the evil fairie is a very romantic notion indeed.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|For Withings Body Scale owners, this is a must.  The Pulse is well-designed, accurate, easy to use and informative (it stores a ton of past days activity at the swipe of a finger.  Try that with a FuelBand.)  The silicone clip is tough and secure, and the wrist band is light on the wrist for your sleepytimes.  I'm a former Fitbit user, and like this a lot more, with the ONLY caveat being that I wish it had the vibrating sleep alarm the Fitbit One has.  But, if you don't need/miss that, this is the tracker for you!
1451695195|1.0|Although reading this book gave me a lot to think about and it sent my mind on many interesting \\"what ifs\\",  I do take issue with the fact that we are not told anything about what Alexander really learned.  It was very aggravating reading.  I kept thinking he would share some tidbits, however incomprehensible, but he does not.  Alexander is confused about his place in the world.  He and his publisher have turned his priceless experience into a bait and switch scam - undoubtably to sell sequels. Very, very sad.
0439882826|5.0|Second time purchasing the Pop Up guide to the Galaxy.  Bought a few years ago for a grandson who to this day still LOVES this book.  Bought for a younger grandson who is a Star Wars fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You will be able to get the best power really cool I bet the world would like this game will not baby's they will just cry
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It it s fun game, easy to use, and enjoy plating with friends, You can play whenever! Easy access, fast speed.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Very fun read couldn't put it down! Charming and witty and both protagonists were funny and relatable.  Kinsella brings her charm and wit as usual.
B000FA57US|4.0|Quick, timely arrival.  New or like new packaging, item in great condition.  Pleasure to do business with seller.  No problems at all, just as I expected.  We've seen all of the Halloween movies and my daughter wanted the collection.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys watching and/or collecting the original Halloween movies.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Always loved medieval culture and fantasy but this combines both in the most amazing storyline of many characters that you switch back and forth between loving and hating.
B004P7CNUY|5.0|Quick, timely arrival.  New or like new packaging, item in great condition.  Pleasure to do business with seller.  No problems at all, just as I expected.  We've seen all of the Halloween movies and my daughter wanted the collection.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|When I read the first few chapters my first thoughts were to discard the whole book!  But I'm not a quitter so I kept on reading and the story or stories grew on me till I just could not put it down.  If by reading the title you think you're getting  proper tea and trumpets genteel ladies mystery, you are in for a surprise.  Yes, it does drag on in spots but hang in there, it gets a lot better very quickly, just give it a chance.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|You can't really play this app without spending REAL money on purchasing extras to play the game further.  DISAPPOINTING.  I deleted it from the kids' Kindles.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought this book yesterday and I JUST finished it. I'm glad I only have a couple of weeks left until the movie comes out!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|My children love this game and I do too. Moves quickly and a lot of fun. All stars from our family.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I got this app because my husband and son are always stealing my  laptop. The app is horrible. Doesn't  load anything in my notifications messages. I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they have a thing for feeling frustrated.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|Watched it without the grandkids and it's still funny the second (or third) time around.  David Spade as a llama is hilarious and Eartha Kitt always delivers.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is very good as Bond, one of my favorite actors for this role.  Grew up with the first bond movies, Sean is my favorite in this role, but Craig is a very close second.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love the way each individual character's story is told! It allows you to be deeply immersed in a story from many different angles.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Thank you Peter.  Followed the book the way I imagined it.  Even re-read the Hobbit before seeing the movie.  Nice job in filning as usual.
0064471837|5.0|I've read this book multiple times and first read it a good 7-8 years ago. I hadn't actually read any reviews and just saw it on a shelf at a local book store and thought, I'll give it a go.<br />A few days later I'd finished it. Basically, I couldn't put it down and desperately wanted to read the next book in the series. What I enjoyed most was the transition of Sabriel from teenager to adult. Again all I have to say is read it and make sure you have plenty of time as you won't want to put it down!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I thought this was a fun watch in the theater.  Enjoy watching it on occasion at home too.  A new James Bond type character.
B004498KPU|5.0|Wonderful, comprehensive collection of all of Michael Jackson's short musical films. Lovely packaging and keepsake book with photos. Highly recommend!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This is an epic movie, the cinimatography was excellent, as is the acting.  You will not see an movies like this anymore, shot on site, maticulous detail in every scene.  Notice the pristeen sand, no tracks from previous shoots.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is better than gameloft there is are some things that could be improved but g5 is much better then gameloft
B008ASLK8A|4.0|These guys did such a good job in the first Sherlock Holmes I couldn't pass up this one.  They are so funny together and play off of each other so well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use and gives me the information I want. Allows me to keep track of weather in my local area as well as what's happening where my son and daughter-in-law live. And it's free. What's not to like?
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I really liked this movie, it fit in the Bourne storyline very well.  I lok forward to Matt and Jeremy teaming up to make the next in the series.
B00D5O7BPU|1.0|this would not download need to get a different app because it stinks this app needs to download I waited a long time to get it! now I cant download it that stinks
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome app ! So much fun to play with and very challenging, for kids and grown ups as well. Really recommend the movie also.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is a very good production - the acting and singing for the most part is excellent.  Hugh Jackman should have won the Oscar for his performance, the heart and soul of the movie.  I didn't feel Russell Crowe was well cast.  His performance is uncomfortable, feel embarrassed for him at times. Anne Hathaway did win - and it is well deserved.  This is a movie my entire family enjoyed - several generations worth.  Would highly recommend adding to your library for those special moments.
B008X9Z3UC|3.0|The Belkin Portfolio Sleeve Carrying Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\" is correctly named. It is a \\"sleeve,\\" lightweight and not too sturdy, certainly not a \\"case\\" that would offer much in the way of protection should you drop your tablet or spill liquid on it. This sleeve would likely absorb the liquid and leave your Kindle wet, too.<br /><br />If a simple cloth sleeve with a sort of leatherish (or is that vinyl?) casing is what you're looking for, this could be for you, but I prefer a case with greater durability.
0316017930|1.0|AWFUL, BORING, (the author looks) CREEPY, DULL and I could go on and on and on! I literally had to FORCE myself to read this dreadful excuse for a book. Why this poorly developed sad excuse for a book ever got published, I'll never know, (it must be by the same idiots who thought Twilight was a good idea.) I love to read and usually can't put a book down, however, this was just begging for me to throw it across the room to it's rightful place-the toilet. The thought that students are being required to read this is pathetic and shows what a poor idea of literature certain teachers have in mind. Let the students read the classics, new books, science fiction, autobiographies, graphic novels, basically ANYTHING but this bore! In a few hundred years, a new breed of human (or maybe aliens) will be digging up remains of our civilization and questioning it's demise, and they'll uncover the Outliers, see teachers attempt to force their students to read and learn from it, and quickly realize why we went downhill. My family runs out of toilet paper fairly quickly, the only upside of owning this book is that we can use it for TP, in case the store is closed.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Loads of fun.  Keeps grandkids busy.  They love it. Wish there were more levels.  Hope any future levels are more challenging.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Although Tom Cruise is a decent actor, he's not my favorite action hero. Also know that I'm VERY easy to please when it comes to movies.<br /><br />Within minutes, you will be able to predict the outcome, but you will still have fun watching it. There are enough twists in the journey to make it interesting. And Robert Duvall was wonderful!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Your typical buy and build game but with added appeal towards children because it's based off Finding Nemo and features characters from the film. Easily geared towards children and not adults, Loses it's luster rather quickly after a short while. Can't say that I'd highly recommend but if you have a kid that loves the film, I'd recommend downloading it for them to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game for all of the family! I would recomend this to adults and children of ages 7+. It is a game of skill and strategy but is not complicated at all! So now when you finish reading this, well first of all if you are not convinced then go and look at other reveiws and secondly if you do like this reveiw then why dont you go and get Subway Surfers at the app store! Go on you know you want to!<br /><br />For kindle fire, kindle fire HD, Ipod, Iphone and Ipad. Probably some others :)
0399208534|5.0|Love this book!  I needed a new copy for my Kindergarten class room as my other copies have been well loved!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|In short, This is a great quality game. The graphics are smooth and and friendly, as well as the animation. The characters, music, and buildings are pretty much spot-on. And the mini-games and quests are fun and cheerful.<br /><br />There is one problem, though. The store, or shop. Almost everything in there immensely over priced. Even though the app is free, you may end up using over $100 in the game anyway. And since some of us don't have the money, sometimes the game gets slow while you slowly save your bits.<br /><br />Then again, this IS kind of typical from Hasbro and the lot.<br /><br />Other than that, it is a great game, and I recommend it to everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family enjoys playing this game. It is fun for every age and never has it gotten boring. I love playing this game. I'd recomend it for everyone and anyone.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I couldn't stop playing, it was so much fun. I loved the excitement and the challenges. Keep them coming and I will keep playing.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app to use to have remote access to your computer from your tablet, in my case my trusty Kindle Fire HD. I highly recommend it. And it's quite reasonably priced, too.
B002VX3RCW|4.0|I got this toy because my son loves the dragonfly Lamaze toy, and we wanted a second toy to hold his attention.  As cute as this one is, he doesn't like it as much as the dragonfly.  He does play with it though, and I think it is really cute and gallops great if a parent dangles it the right way.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|it is pretty good you just got to get in the zzone  GGGGOOOOAAAATTTT''''SSSS RRRROOOOCCCCKKKK and the SHAYTARDS  what is the new babys name besides grimlin tard
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is good because it lets you create the city that you ever wanted.  Its complex and fun to even watch  someone else play.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Like many others, my game worked fine for a couple of days, and then on Aug 3rd, it stopped. It gets stuck on the loading page. Really bummed my 5 yr old out :( I tried reinstalling 3 times, and nothing worked. Maybe I'll try again in a week or so? Very disappointing.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Really enjoyed this game. Would be 5 stars but now and then the controls got fiddly when trying to solve a puzzle.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have been pleasantly surprised with what this can do for being a $35 item.  It will only get better as more apps support it.  I ordered it on July 24th and still haven't received my 3 months of Netflix code.  Please email it Amazon, I have some TV shows to watch!
B00005JKG9|2.0|You can't wait to watch this movie, right? Wow, all those brilliant actors together on one project! How did this film possibly escape your attention until now!  Let's fire it up and....<br /><br />What? Nothing happens? Oh, yes, this is a talkie alright. Based on a play, all the action takes place in a couple of rooms in a few long takes. Every other word is an expletive and the words in between are \\"the leads!\\"<br /><br />The actors are great, Jack Lemmon in particular. However, there is no action, story arc, no character evolution. Nobody is different at the end than they were at the beginning. This can be forgivable in a different genre - James Bond, a murder mystery, a thriller. But not here. Who was I rooting for?  I'll let you know if I figure it out.<br /><br />Sure, some of the sleazy sales pitches are delivered memorably... but one or two would do. More than an hour's worth? I forgive you if you thought you were in a time-share sales meeting.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|good game. would be better if they didn't try to get u to spend money to help advance throught the levels.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book was recommended to me, and if it hadn't I probably wouldn't have read it as it is not in my genre at all.  This is a fantasy, or an adult fairy tale.  The title certainly intrigued me and made me move this book up to the top of my \\"to read\\" list.  This is a well written story about strange happenings in the life of a seven year old boy and his chance meeting with 11 year old Lettie Hemstock.  The story is written in the first person, and it begins with this boy coming back home 35 years later to attend a funeral.  He makes a trek to the strange house at the end of the lane from where he lived and his memories of what happened when he was seven come rushing back to him.  He re-experiences all the terror and wonder all over and as we read we go back with him.  Mr. Gaiman's writing is lyrical and descriptive.  He has a talent for making the unbelievable believable.  I found that I was totally engrossed in the fantasy and with these strange Hemstock women.  I am glad I read the book.  Sometimes reading something in a totally different genre than what I'm used to helps to rejuvenate my reading experiences.
B002G1QYY2|1.0|I sought it out because it is a classic but found the author's prose dense and with few paragraphs, hard to read.
B000ICXQF6|4.0|All time classic, great story and great acting , when brad Pitt was at his prime ! Great picture an sound on blu ray
B00AJLHU3K|3.0|What with all the glowing reviews and the Nashville exposure I expected better. I am a big fan of Mr. Thompson!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I don't write reviews often, but was compelled to write one for this game. Not a Tetris ripoff, but in the same vane. Very good graphics. Smooth game play. Addictive. Could use access to sound options from pause menu, but that's about the only bad thing I could even think of. And no intrusive permissions either. Bravo to the dev.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles but can't actually do them with my young children around. This app is perfect. Just like a real puzzle.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I had this CD when it first came out and lost it somewhere over the years.  It's the best Santana music ever!
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I'm still  Confused on whether like this series  or not sometimes.  Get into it while the are tines all  I want to do is skim it an  Get it over with.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Wow! I love this stylus! I have looked for a specific kind of stylus tip and this one has not just the one I wanted, but two others that work well in different situations! On my phone, the smaller, firmer tip works best. On my kindle, the larger softer tip works best and for the copier/printer/fax machine at work the medium tip is great. The length is just perfect, and the circumference is not too skinny and not too fat. The only draw back is that the cap doesn't stay on very well. It slips off easily when in use or in the holder, causing the stylus to fall out; I've nearly lost it twice. Otherwise a terrific product!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to play and i enjoyed every moment of it. I usually get upset with the guard get me but it all right i can always play over and over again.
B00D6MJOAQ|4.0|This album means a lot to me as I try to mitigate the uptempo dance tracks or any sensational song that leads to poor decision-making. This album transcends its serenity, its tranquility very easily. It does have a mix of beats and then tracks, but overall its about the sounds for me.
0345803485|5.0|I really didnt read erotica until this book became popular. But when one of my friends gave me this book. I couldnt stop reading it. I read through the first book in only a day. It was amazing. I can't wait for the movie to come out.<br /><br />pleasureforyournight.blogspot.com
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This is app has a lot of problems and doesn't deserve the grace it is getting  Each time I try to watch something it freezes every 5 seconds unless u lower the quality to 360  Plus when I turn off my kindle the audio still continues  Plus instead of asking if your old enough to watch a certain video they just remove it all together  Those are only a few things I have encountered  So to the developer I have to say this , FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX THIS F***EN S***!!!!!!!!
B00CEF014E|5.0|Loved this. Great plot, fantastic characters. The writing is smart and seductive. I especially liked the unpredictable story line. Definitely one of the better Kindle thrillers out there. Strong recommendation.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Another great CD by Michael Buble. Of course whether or not you like it, it all depends on your musical tastes. I'm just saying that if you like Buble's genre of music you will probably fall in love with this CD as much as I did.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|If you like James Bond you will LOVE this book. I learned so much about Ian Fleming. What a fascinating life! This is an awesome story. The characters are so well written. The action is amazing. Outstanding!!
014241493X|5.0|I really loved this book. All John Green books are just books you need to read. And all of them make you cry. Buts that's because John Green writes it how it is. It hits you like a ton of bricks, just like life. Paper towns really is very interesting. You may not cry in this one, I didn't. But I know many people that did. Read Paper Towns. I strongly recommend it.
0064471837|5.0|I picked up Sabriel because of the beautiful cover illustration (I actually picked up Lirael first, but then realized that Sabriel was the first in the series). When I got home from the bookstore, I lay in bed and devoured this book. I've read it multiple times since, and I'm never disappointed. Garth Nix has crafted a world and mythos that is truly immersive, and used magic in a way I hadn't seen before. Being a female, I sought out female heroines in my books and Nix delivered with Sabriel. She is not a cardboard cutout character, and her strength doesn't come from sexuality but from her intelligence and sense of right and wrong. This book has a place on my shelf and it won't be leaving anytime soon.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It's full of action and Scifi and once you start watching you are hooked. Doctor Who is probably one of the most interesting shows I have watched
0064471837|5.0|I've read this story a good ten years ago. It is still a book I would pick up today and read again.<br /><br />It is a brilliant piece of work!
B000000OQ5|4.0|Tesla is a good band. Good music and a good compact disc. I really enjoy their music and style. Have fun.
0385349831|2.0|I'm aware of Coelho's reputation and influence, so I won't give up after one book, but as an introduction I will assume this was about the worst book I could have started with.  This seems like the kind of book you write because you've sold 100 million books and no one can tell you no.<br /><br />There was no real narrative, instead the book is a series of platitudes, some more empty than others, with a few genuine nuggets of real wisdom strewn about.  Coelho took conventional wisdom sayings from the three Abrahamic religions, misinterpreted many of them (possibly on purpose), and lost the relevance of all three of those religions in the process.<br /><br />I found some truth here, and I was glad it read quickly as I got through its nearly 200 pages in just a couple of hours, but there was a lot about this book that fell flat for me.<br /><br />I'll move on the Alchemist next before giving up on Coelho.
B0058VW36U|1.0|My six-year-old was enjoying the game and after a few levels (fifteen minutes of play) the game becomes impossible unless you pay more money.  One option calls for paying over $25.00.  I will avoid purchasing any games from this company.  I am disappointed that greed blinded the developers.  You build a relationship of trust and loyalty with your consumers and they will come back and pay a fair price.  Tricking a six-year-old is unforgivable.  You don't mess with children.
1447201574|5.0|This is an excellent book which I bought for my 16 yr. old grandson--I had already read it.  The book arrived in excellent condition and speedily.
0007466064|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for the next two books. I recommend reading the king killer chronicles while waiting by Patrick Rothfuss.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the 1st book was great.  It kept my attention the whole time.  The premises was intreguing.  Nothing more to say
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I really love Once Upon a Time. It is my favorite show. I loved the second season even more than the first as the past of many characters was revealed in greater detail. You also get a feel for the history that led up to what is going on in the present. There are some amazing surprises, I think especially in episode 14. It is very enjoyable and I can't wait till it is out on DVD.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I haven't played this type of games for years ... mainly because I couldn't find one I liked (Tropico / Pirates).  I really like all the games from Playrix (own them all) and took a chance on Royal E envoy.<br /><br />I'm disabled, and spend alot of time playing games on my Kindle HD 9&quot;, and Royal Envoy has a lot of play value.  I played a week or two, every day, all day. The storyline is cute, graphics are wonderful. Even though it's timed, you can ignore that and still have a great game experience -- you just don't get a gold star and some extra points.  I highly recommend -- it's well worth the money for the full version.(60 some islands to fix).
0375869840|4.0|My daughter is 3 and she just loves this book, she can read it herself (of course in her own words) but she is pretty close because it has been read to her so much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is like taking care of your own horse.It's great for kids for all ages.We love it!! Get it now
1558908382|5.0|What a wonderful dark sarcastic comedy. Can't beat Joan Cusack!  Minnie Driver is great a great ride. A real classic.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|When I first started playing uno it was fun and easy. You just keep on using your cards until there gone. And UNO you win
B005EVVESM|5.0|Love this CD, Maroon Five, always puts out great music. If your a fan or just getting into their music, this is an awesome one!!
B0036S4C6G|4.0|I liked the slang. It brought me back from being distracted while reading. Similar to Molly ringwalds. Flow of writing style
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|So this is where the Hype is better then the film. Slow and grinding. Was so looking forward to getting this. sorry I did, so it sits on the shelf gathering dust.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game in my opinion. I like this game so much because u get to build your own village and if you don`t like those kind of games then I would not recommend this game for you.
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|Very odd, story jumps around and dosent make sense to me. Way too weird and slow for me.up to you if you want to try it.
B001S31MTQ|5.0|Aldous Leonard Huxley (1894-1963) was an English writer. He wrote in this 1954 book, &#34;Administered in suitable doses, [mescalin] changes the quality of consciousness more profoundly and yet is less toxic any other substance in the pharmacologist's repertory.&#34; (Pg. 9-10) He added, &#34;the sleuths---biochemists, psychiatrists, psychologists---are on the trail... I found myself, in the spring of 1953, squarely athwart that trail. One of the sleuths had come on business to California... I was on the spot and willing, indeed eager, to be a guinea pig. Thus it came about that ... I swallowed four-tenths of a gram of mescalin dissolved in half a glass of water and sat down to wait for the results.&#34; (Pg. 12)<br /><br />He records, &#34;what happens to the majority ... who have taken mescalin under supervision can be summarized as follows: (1) The ability to remember and to 'think straight' is little if at all reduced... (2) Visual impressions are greatly intensified and the eye recovers some of the perpetual innocence of childhood... (3)... the will suffers a profound change for the worse. The mescalin taker sees no reason for doing anything in particular and finds most... causes... profoundly uninteresting... he has better things to think about. (4) ... That they ARE better seems to be self-evident to all mescalin takers who come to the drug with a sound liver and an untroubled mind.&#34; (Pg. 25-26)<br /><br />He observes, &#34;The outer world is what we wake up to every morning of our lives, is the place where, willy-nilly, we must try to make our living. In the inner world there is neither work nor monotony. We visit it only in dreams and musings, and its strangeness is such that we never find the same world on two successive occasions. What wonder, then, if human beings in their search for the divine have generally preferred to look within!&#34; (Pg. 46-47)<br /><br />He concludes, &#34;But the man who comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out. He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet better equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of systematic reasoning to the unfathomable Mystery which it tries, forever vainly, to comprehend.&#34; (Pg. 79)<br /><br />This book (along with Alan Watts' [[ASIN:1608682048 The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness]]) is one of the &#34;classics&#34; in the serious study of psychedelic chemicals.quite the same as the man who went out. He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet better equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of systematic reasoning to the unfathomable Mystery which it tries, forever vainly, to comprehend.&#34; (Pg. 79)<br /><br />This book (along with Alan Watts' [[ASIN:1608682048 The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness]]) is one of the &#34;classics&#34; in the serious study of psychedelic chemicals.
B0013ND36G|5.0|Love it, the Terminator movies rock. If you hacve not seen it, you need to. If you have, then you know what Im talking about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really cool and you can build anything you want and lots of updates too and its awesome:)
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Saw this drive in back in the day. This is really a great sci-fi action movie --- love it and watch it all the time.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|As most reviewers has already pointed out the game resembles the classic tetris game in many ways. This game does take 35.4MB (considerably large) of your device's storage and installs just fine on Kindle as well as other Android Samsung tablets. The game works only in 'portrait' mode, while it does not fully utilize the screen size in this fashion but still very much enjoyable.<br /><br />The game starts in tutorial mode and walks you thru' the rules of the game which I find very useful. The graphics are smooth and you can surely waste some time sliding blocks especially in the \\"Zen\\" mode. After playing for about an hour I find this is not very spectacular but not very bad either at the same time. Having said, for the offered price of $2 I think it is on the little 'expensive' side. It should be 99c to remain competitive with games of similar style as there are many similar games in this category to compete with.<br /><br />Three stars from me.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|What else do I have to say?? Its bruno Mars!! Yes it does have words that youngsters may not be suited for.
1904920233|5.0|Birthday gift for a friend who really loved it.  If you have been to this restaurant in Europe, you will want to have the cookbook.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is fun because you can try to beat vector so that's it bye. And you can get the baby and that might be cool.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good luck working ever again I could play this all day. Spent tons of money on extra tokens and stuff
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing for 3 years &amp; I still enjoy it! I love the challenges,completing the rooms &amp; making new friends! You can't find another game on Facebook that has the graphics that this game has! It's by far the best game I have ever played! :)
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This game is fun but I got all my animals to the last level and now there is nothing to do on this game. I also don't like how you have to pay for gams.  They also want you to become friends with people.  I like it but there is nothing to do on it anymore.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|It's Liam Neeson, it can't be a bad movie, in fact it is just a great, fun, entertaining action movie and refreshing to see an older man do action well. I am tired of 20 year old vampires.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Way too much fun, but a great resource for so many ideas -- cooking, decorating, travel, fashion, reading.  I love it!  (Too much!)
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Ok I'm just going to admit it this is a really really good cd. The boys sound great, the harmonies are fantastic as usual, and they have finally matured. Glad Kevin is back he was missed and glad they are one group that stuck together and put the music first and stayed true to themselves and not tried to fit into what everyone else was doing. These guys are known for their pop/easy rhythm sound and this cd fits into that category. Good job boys can't wait for the concert.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love bubble games !!!! And this is the second of two that have really challenged me, I love it!!!!!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Wow, if you have not seen this movie yet, it is definitely a must-see!  Very potent and poignant and left me speechless.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Price was great, DVD arrived in a week and was in perfect condition. The DVDs hadn't come loose, the cases hadn't broken and there wasn't a scratch on anything. Very happy with my purchase!! And this series is great!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I totally love minion rush!!!!! It is fun and exiting , with adorable animation.<br />I have three words for you people out there.<br />GET THIS APP!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Price was great, DVD arrived in a week and was in perfect condition. The DVDs hadn't come loose, the cases hadn't broken and there wasn't a scratch on anything. Very happy with my purchase!! And this series is great!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so freaking fun it's addicting! I love playing this before I go to school in the morning.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Price was great, DVD arrived in a week and was in perfect condition. The DVD hadn't come loose, the case hadn't broken and there wasn't a scratch on anything. Very happy with my purchase!! And this movie was great! Very funny!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's amazing there are about 20 horses to choose from. You get to ride train and care for your horse! It's not like the other sucking games that say that you can ride your horse like the lame game horse life adventures. This is the best horse game ever!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Sad life ruiner don't read this if you don't want to cry. Stop now and don't purchase this. You will cry.
1400049628|2.0|It's a zombie book and I love things associated with zombies. So as far as the book that I haven't read yet I'm sure it will be to my approval.<br /><br />The problem I have is the condition it was in when I received it, it looks like someone rolled it up and carried it in their back pocket for the day before boxing it up for shipping. It also appears to have been dropped on the corner of the book where the spine is located leaving the corner bent. Also the cover was dirty.<br /><br />If I had received the book in good condition I probably would have rated it 5 stars. But since I didn't it only gets a 2.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Gillian Flynn is a very good writer and she did a great job keeping me on my toes and guessing as to what would happen next. I have to give her credit in getting me to read the entire book in order to know the ending and the final outcome of Nick & Amy. Unfortunately, this book deserves a two at best and I think I am being generous. Having lived through disfunction I know how it looks and feels, Nick & Amy's idea of &#34;love&#34; and marriage are so far off base that at the end I just felt dirty and used. The ride Flynn took me on was not worth it, I wish I knew how truly dysfunctional Gone Girl was before I started to read. Save your money unless you want to jump on the &#34;Gone Girl&#34; bandwagon and borrow it from the library. Won't bother to see the movie either....
B003B96AOW|5.0|This is probably the most detailed action figure I've seen, especially in this price point. He is accurately imaged after the comic book version, and comes with a variety of weapons.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I bought this camera before my wife and I went on a scuba diving trip to Hawaii and was not disappointed. Very awesome picture quality and loaded with features. I set the camera so that when I am shooting video it takes a picture every five seconds. This feature is great and not only did I capture awesome
B009DCOU9S|5.0|It is a very fun hidden object game with a twist. Very entertaining can barely put it down a must have
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Absolutely one of my all time favorite movies, a must own, and repeat watch, Guy Ritchie shines as do Jude law and RJD.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is definitely a must-see.  I'm certainly not a child anymore, but I'm young at heart.  I enjoyed this movie so much!
B000L212HC|5.0|Genius of a movie with a twist, even a few, movie making is high art and great storytelling, this is no exception.  GREAT movie, pay attention though!  And David Bowie as Tesla!?!?!? This knocked it out of the park.
0061655554|5.0|Impossible to put this book down.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this book and Den of Thieves, another phenomenal book.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Original humor, when writing, timing, and delivery with sublet nature was what comedy was about, not Adam Sandler acting like a 12 year old for 90 minutes, this would be lost on you if that is your type of humore.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The trouble with this item is not the item itself but the delivery from Amazon Instant Video.  The movie froze at least 3 times (once going to a black screen), requiring in 2 of those instances a return to the Wii menu.  My Wi-Fi signal is not the issue because I don't have this problem with my Wii (for Netflix) or other electronic devices in my home.  Charging a $4.99 rental fee in this case, Amazon should do a better job with the delivery or at least reduce the fee.  This is the second time I've used AIV and I had trouble both times.  Very disappointing.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he did not exist.  That is part of the mystery.  Better than ALL the surprise ending movies you will ever watch.  Violent, so be forewarned.
B003XQM2YU|2.0|Bad story line and little or no character development I would not recommend this at all.<br />They took too many liberties with the Robin Hood story.<br />The original story line is better and what I was looking for.
1558908382|5.0|First, chick dig John Cusack.  Second, it is funny as hell.  One of Dan Akroyds best performances.  Great dark humor.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|The Killers prove that arena rock is alive and well.  And let's face it, there are very few bands out there today - who came out in the past 10 years - that can fill arenas.  The only disappointment for me watching this DVD was that America has not embraced and appreciated The Killers the way the UK has.  I would have loved to have been at this show.  The energy is amazing watching this DVD. As one reviewer so eloquently put it - do not be fooled by Brandon Flowers' boyish good looks or that he looks like the guy who just packed your groceries at the supermarket, He's the quintessential frontman who grabs the audience by the throat and immediately makes it part of the show. The rest of the band - Dave, Ronnie, and Mark, are equally gifted at their respective crafts as well.  I'm looking forward to a new DVD from the Wembley show.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Nice big screen and easy to use!  Definitely a terrific buy!  I would recommend to anyone looking to add a calculator to their Kindle.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|This is Tetris with a twist a good or bad twist. That's debatable. In steed of a block slowly falling you slide a block and the prices fall down. You still have the classic combos and line everything in a line and lose the same way. If you love Tetris give it a try.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I've been playing it every night when I get home from work. I would have given you five stars but I have a serious problem with the whole scratch card thing. I work and go to school. I don't have time to get on here every 45 minutes to a scratch card to get tokens to play. Why can't you do a daily thing and award those who come back and play daily like Farkle? I really like playing but I only ever get to play 4 games tops each day. Really a bummer. I can play Farkle all night, I like your game better but they have made it so you can play longer. Please fix this otherwise I'll be forced to keep playing another game in loo of yours.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love the game just wish it would generate coins faster but very fun game never thought I'd play this game til a friend told me about it.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|great series all together but every movie is so long. Why do we as a culture feel the need to watch 3 hr movies. Other then that it was good. lol
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  I couldn't recommend it more.  The blu-ray series comes with all the seasons plus Razor and The Plan.  I got it for about $90 too, can't beat that price
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This looks very nice, has a good lay out and lots of info....but its lacking a map and warrings section would have given 5 stars but with out the map and warnings part it only gets four
0547338007|5.0|I bought this for a young child. The old version that I read as a teenager would not be appropriate for an infant, but this is a great way to get children hooked on classics.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|I Solve It in Two Days, But It Was Fun!!! The Graphics Were Great.... And I Like The Hint Option.<br />I think It Was Worth The $2
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|im not dissing momoa i think hes a hunk as long as he doesnt act ! lets just say modeling and battle star is it.... the story on the other hand was even worse!
0064471837|5.0|This is a great book, it immerses you into a world all it's own. There are twists and turns that won't be guessed and it's a tale you'll definitely enjoy. It's great for readers of all ages and a book you will most definitely want to read again!
0064471837|5.0|When I first read Sabriel, many years ago (and its sequels, Lirael and Abhorsen), I was captivated. The world it is set in is unique and feels like there's much more to it than is revealed in the books. The characters are likable and imperfect. The story is gripping.<br /><br />The story is gripping because of all the interesting details woven in - the relationship between the traditional fantasy landscape of the Old Kingdom and the modern country of Ancelstierre on the other side of the wall separating them. The unique styles of magic that exist within the Old Kingdom, with just enough ambiguity as to how the magic actually works. Combine many little original details with particular interesting settings and a classic fantastical quest to restore a fallen kingdom, and you have a rollicking good story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

1594136238|5.0|DEFENDING JACOB  rates among the top 10 books I've read in a long time!  It was a great mystery, an absorbing read and a book I found  very hard to put down and even harder to stop thinking and talking about.  The characters are deftly drawn and pull you into their world without effort.  If you have kids, it's a must read.  If you live in this world, it's a must read.  Highly recommended!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show gets you hooked - Julianna Margulies is outstanding in her role, demonstrating her character's (Alicia) strengths, vulnerabilities and moral compass.  Interesting legal cases but they don't take center stage - the dynamics of all the relationships are the driving force in this series and that's why I love it.  Supporting cast is great - especially character played by Archie Panjabi (Kalinda) whio is full of surprises.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|I thought that this movie was actually really good. I liked the plot quite a lot, and the emotions in it were good too. I reccommend it.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Before you get this watch on Youtube the SNL skit on \\"Just one more episode\\".... This show is already a classic... but have an entire week or a few weekends available before you watch... you won't be able to stop.. even after the final episode.  And you will find yourself walking around saying \\"Frak\\" everywhere... Watching this is like Crack for your ears, eyes, and brain.  Great Show!... and Good Luck.

0064471837|5.0|I read this novel several years ago when I was a teenager. It was fascinating then, and it is similarly fascinating now.<br /><br />Featuring a young girl as the protagonist, Sabriel functions as a lovely role model for female readers. She is easily identified with, strong, highly intelligent, curious, and resourceful, all traits I'd love for my daughter to develop some day. Coupled with the amazing setting and fantastic elements, as well as a stellar plot, I'd rate this book in as high regard as Robin McKinley's \\"The Hero and the Crown.\\"<br /><br />The audio book isn't half bad, either. Tim Curry narrates. Need I say more?
B001FW58D6|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy this show. It's brilliant, funny, insightful and out of the ordinary. I understand that some people might not like it, but as everything in life, people always find flaws. Fringe is now one of our all time favorites... planning on buying the DVDs too.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I had stopped reading books on sales due to numbing repetition and the same old 'techniques' dressed up in new clothes.

140006922X|5.0|The historical Jesus is a topic that I'm beginning to delve into, and Reza's book has served as an excellent primer for additional reading.<br /><br />In numerous interviews, Reza has explained that his intention is not to shake anyone's faith, or to obliterate the Christian religion. Rather, he sought to humanize the man who became myth and legend in the Gospels and letters that make up the New Testament.<br /><br />That being said, he makes a number of assertions that directly contradict the Gospels in ways that will make any Christian somewhat squeamish. But while doing so, he raises a lot of really good points.<br /><br />Throughout the book, he emphasizes one thing over and over: When you read the Gospels and the letters that make up the New Testament, it is critical that you consider the audience that it is being written for. Also, realize that the writers of the Gospels and letters had a very different concept of history and accuracy that we do today. Contradictions and in some cases complete fabrications were less important than the message itself.<br /><br />I consider myself a Christian and reading this book has actually strengthened my faith and adherence to Christ's message. I feel like I have a better handle on Jesus the man, and why his message has persevered. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a Christian and wishes to get a better understanding of the origins of your faith.<br /><br />I would also recommend reading James Tabor's book about Paul, called [[ASIN:1439123314 Paul and Jesus: How the Apostle Transformed Christianity]]. Reza touches briefly on Paul toward the end of the book. James's book is a much more in depth account.

It is full of beautiful concept art but I did not like the fact that a third of the book is about Skyward Sword, the other third was Hyrule history and the last third was concept art for all the games plus some miscellaneous things abut the video games and a comic book about Skyward Sword. I thought they should of put only concept art and Hyrule History.

B0060MYK7G|2.0|It seems I'm in minority here, but I think Season 2 started the downfall of the series. Apparently, the writers decided that even the scant amount of history on display in Season 1 was much too binding for them. As it often happens, their dull, uninspired and predictable storylines are no match for the real historical events. The actors are doing what they can but don't expect any intriguing character development here.<br /><br />Cesare, who showed some ambition and cynical attitudes in Season 1, is starting to become a knight in the shining armor who only acts out of vengeance or to protect his family. And he is not particularly adept at that. Aut Caesar, aut nihil? Forget about that. Rodrigo continues to be a vengeful idiot (points for having a busier sex life than his eldest son). Juan, who was a wastrel, but an easy-going one, inexplicably become so mean and overbearing that everyone wants to kill him. Lucrezia... she just wants to be loved. And to give cooking lessons to the cardinals. Della Rovere, tired of the assassination attempts on his life (who can blame him), decides to stick it to the Borgia and become a master assassin himself (I guess he could be a good character on Assassin Creed). Sancha and Joffre... they're not there anymore. And I mean, at all. They will never show up again. Not even when Lucrezia marries Sancha's brother. (Ok, I admit Joffre is not the most interesting Borgia man, but they could have at least mentioned him a couple of times). You can see how well they're paying attention to detail here.<br /><br />What was good, aside from the production values? Cesare + Lucrezia is still going strong and the only reason I kept watching the series through Season 3. I also liked seeing Francesco Gonzaga who, surprisingly, resembled his portrait quite a bit. I'm still at a loss to explain why they gave him a fake wife instead of Isabella d'Este (sister of Alfonso d'Este, Lucrezia's third husband) who had a famous rivalry with Lucrezia. And Savanarola scenes were decent, although, again, they changed details for no apparent reason.<br /><br />In the end, the second season of The Borgias is just a pseudo-historical soap opera with vaguely medieval costumes and sets and with one-dimensional characters who bear little resemblance with their famous Renaissance prototypes.<br /><br />Once again, I recommend checking the other Borgia show (run by Tom Fontana with the European channels) if you want to see at least something that resembles history.

1451626096|1.0|This review will freely discuss a plot twist that happens in the first 100 pages of this book - a plot twist that to the best of my knowledge is not based on historical facts, nor is it addressed at the end in the author's notes. From reading other reviews, it seems the cat is out of the bag, but I will err on the side of caution and mark this review as containing spoilers.<br /><br />The White Princess is the fifth book in Philippa Gregory's Cousins' War series, each book focusing on a different female lead; this book being the POV of Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville (whose story was told in The White Queen), and wife to Henry VII. The book begins after the battle at Bosworth field, and as interpreted by Ms. Gregory has young Elizabeth pining over her lost lover, Richard (her uncle!!). Elizabeth, mom and all those younger sisters come to court with the expectation that she's going to marry Henry Tudor, but Henry and mom Margaret Beaufort don't seem to be in any hurry--->>>real spoiler>>>ebil Margaret wants to make sure Elizabeth can conceive a child before the happy nuptials and orders Henry to rape her. If Elizabeth can't conceive, he'll take choice #2, younger sister Cecily.<br /><br />\\"I'm not very fond of spoiled meats, I don't want another man's leaving. The thought of Richard the Usurper pawing you about and you fawning on him for the crown makes me quite sick.\\"<br /><br />A peach of a man is Henry, and mother Margaret is some piece of work. Elizabeth, being spineless and dull as dishwater (at least as written by Ms. Gregory), makes the best of her marriage popping out the heir and the spare and other boring stuff for 300 or so pages.<br /><br />\\"Two years pass before we conceive another child...\\"<br /><br />\\"Instead I will be the shape that my husband's mother wants: a rounded fertile pear of a woman, a vessel for Tudor seed, a pot.<br /><br />There is still the mystery of the fate of Elizabeth's younger brothers Edward and Richard, who disappeared from the Tower of London never to be seen again, and not a body to be found anywhere. Which of course leads to people pretending to be one of the lost boys (or are they pretenders?), including one Perkin Warbeck. What does a loving sister to do if she recognizes her lost brother (or does she recognize him?), and does her loyalty go with the sibling or her husband and father of her children?<br /><br />Should be interesting stuff, right? Well in this case, with this author, it's not. Boring, boring, boring. The Elizabeth that Ms. Gregory gives us is a spineless doormat who parrots everything her husband says - no original dialogue to be found coming out of her mouth. Add to that mix the author's very bad habit of clubbing the reader over the head with people's names and titles (does someone really think in their private thoughts about their half-brother as \\"Thomas Grey, Mother's boy\\"?), and of course the mind-numbing repetitiveness of her prose all makes for a very underwhelming read (did we really need to hear about The Royal House of York on every page?). Speaking of that repetition, I did get a giggle out of this quote from Margaret:<br /><br />\\"Richard put them to death,\\" she repeats, as if repetition will make it so.<br /><br />I guess if you repeat something enough times, folks will start to believe it's true like so many folks believe Ms. Gregory's version of history is the real deal. Not.<br /><br />And the big twist over the fate of the young princes in the tower and who done them in as Ms. Gregory sees it? Bah!<br /><br />Do I have anything good to say about it? The font was large with generous spacing between lines, very short chapters and at least we didn't have [[ASIN:B0054U5790 Henry VII drinking the blood of sanguine young men]].<br /><br />From the author's notes (two whole pages!):<br /><br />\\"This book does not claim to reveal the truth either: it is a fiction based on many studies of these fascinating times and gives, I hope, an intothe untold stories and the unknown characters with affection and respect.\\"<br /><br />Sorry, but Henry Tudor didn't exactly get much respect in the first part of this book :/<br /><br />My copy obtained via library loan.the untold stories and the unknown characters with affection and respect.\\"<br /><br />Sorry, but Henry Tudor didn't exactly get much respect in the first part of this book :/<br /><br />My copy obtained via library loan.

B00E9PXI3S|1.0|I was so excited about this movie because of the two main stars that were cast in it, however, I am sorry to say that this was one of the top two worst movies that I have ever seen.  I am shocked that either of these two talented actresses agreed to take part in it.  I could've written this screenplay, and that is not saying much. Poorly acted, poorly directed.  I kept waiting for something profound to happen, and it never did!  Don't rent this.  It is not worth the money!!!

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A rather short book, a bit scary in a childhood sort of way, both sad and heartwarming. In some ways it reminded me of Terry Pratchett's witches - the wise women that control the powers of Nature but care deeply about the people they meet and understand their small ways. Then again, it's a unique book - a true Neil Gaimen story.

B009NG1Q96|3.0|...Nothing of significance happens in this book. The whole story-line could have been incorporated into the first novel. I'm seriously frustrated right now - I'd hoped something interesting would have happened in book 2. But alas, nothing. I hate feeling screwed out of my money. Author needs to take literary classes in &#34;series&#34; writing.<br /><br />The premise is basically a recycled Hunger Games with a Bachelor TV show feel. Nothing unique or spectacular...just, meh. I won't be reading book 3. What a waste of 3 hours!!

Slightly different from the originals but in a good way. His guitar playing ability, so effortless, and his interpretation of the songs in his own masterful style really comes out. You will be pleased.

B0055OG2BC|3.0|First, this movie will be much more enjoyable for people over 50 or people who grew up watching old movies. Stars such as Petter Sellers, David Niven, Orson Wells, Woody Allen and Ursula Andress conjure up thoughts of an age gone by. But no matter what your age, you cannot miss the jokes about James Bond 007 and how he gets the jobs done. Make no mistake this is not another of the 20 plus action movies about James Bond. This movie was made strictly for laughs.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I don't give many books a score of 5 but this one definitely deserved it.  It isn't typically the type of book I like to read, but I'm so glad that I did.  I highly recommend it!

B002QGUFWE|5.0|Suppose I'll start this review off the same way as the last one. I've been a fan of Lady Gaga ever since Poker Face came out, and had a huge crush on her ever since. Though this is technically an EP as it only contains 8 songs, most fans including myself consider it her second album. As described, this also comes with a second disc containing every song from The Fame, which was what this album was originally meant to be, a \\"DLC addon\\" of sorts to her first album. Here, I'll review each of the 8 songs individually as I did for The Fame.<br /><br />Bad Romance: This was the lead single, released to promote this album a few months before it came out. It's very fast paced, and lyrically it's about sharing even the darkest facets of love. It's best summed up by a quote from her that states, \\"I want the deepest, darkest, sickest parts of you that you are afraid to share with anyone because I love you that much.\\" It does a great job as a lead single and reminds me of my days of playing Halo 3: ODST, as both were released the same month.<br /><br />Alejandro: In my opinion, this is the album's weakest point, but it's far from bad. It has a very dance-able beat that starts off slow and picks up during the chorus. Supposedly the lyrics reference gays in the military, though I wasn't able to tell right off. This song sorta grew on me after a while, and hearing her sing it live at the Born This Way Ball sounded loads better than the studio version. It was the album's third and final single.<br /><br />Monster: The album's title track, and my favorite song out of the eight. The beat is fantastic, and combined with the vocals, it makes for an unforgettable earworm. The lyrics describe the desire to get out of a bad or abusive relationship versus the inability to do so as the person takes over your life. It's one of those \\"club songs\\" that still has meaning to it.<br /><br />Speechless: Easily one of my favorites on the album. Another rock/piano ballad that feels like something of a spiritual successor to The Fame's \\"Brown Eyes\\". Get ready to go on a feels trip, because this songs lyrics are about Lady Gaga pleading with her ill father to undergo life-saving open heart surgery. Needless to say, it's some moving stuff.<br /><br />Dance in the Dark: As the title might suggest, it has a very dark, ethereal feel to it. This song is about the realization of one's insecurities, as well as overcoming them. It references many famous people who died tragically. Though there is no official music video, the fan-made one is definitely something I recommend checking out.<br /><br />Telephone: My favorite out of the three singles from this album, and this one had the most hype built up around it, as it features Beyonce, who I'm also a fan of. This song and its accompanying music video serve as a sequel to \\"Paparazzi\\", with the video taking place where that one last left off. The video had a ton of production put into it and contains a ton of reference to Quentin Tarantino movies. It's a rather humorous plot, with Beyonce breaking Gaga out of jail and killing everyone there. I definitely recommend watching it.<br /><br />So Happy I Could Die: Possibly the \\"sexiest\\" song on the album, with a bouncy, dark beat and plenty of references to...well, y'know...jerkin'. It's about using things such as alcohol as an escape to a happier place during tough times, or just to escape reality itself. It's a rather depressing concept that makes for a song with deep meaning to it. Another high point to the album.<br /><br />Teeth: Ending things off is a song with a gothic, almost horror feeling to it. Seriously, the first thing the beat brings to my mind is the \\"Hang Castle\\" stage from Sonic Heroes. Lyrically, it's about the idea that there's nothing wrong with telling the truth, she wants you to show her all you've got. It has a bit of an old-school feel to it, and it's very enjoyable.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is yet another incredibly solid album from my favorite pop artist, and much like The Fame, it does a great job at standing out from most mainstream radio pop. If I had to complain about one thing, it'd be the choice of what songs to release as singles, as the best ones on the album are in fact the non-singles IMO. Either way, I highly suggest The Fame Monster if you like Lady Gaga's other two albums.p artist, and much like The Fame, it does a great job at standing out from most mainstream radio pop.

0307341577|5.0|This is a crazy, suspenseful, creepy, bizarre, and twisty novel. Of course, it wouldn't be Gillian Flynn if it wasn't all of those things :)<br /><br />Awesome book that gives you a true mystery that you won't figure out until the very end!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Very good  I love it try it  u would love it to try it please it is a very  chat room
0307744434|5.0|Loved it! Very unique storyline! I doubt I could describe this book, so I won't try. :)<br /><br />I really enjoyed the imagery. I often quit books with a ton of descriptions because ... BORING!! The details were woven into this story really well, so I never tried to skip ahead. :)<br /><br />I think this would make an excellent movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|IPad is 2 updates ahead that's just messed up I'm so sad.<br />And one update has... I wouldn't tell you the rest.
1594746036|3.0|I didn't understand all the hype behind this book. The pictures included with the story line were pretty cool, but otherwise the story itself was a letdown. The peculiar-ness of the children was intriguing but there was no real character development. I did not feel particularly attached to any of the characters and didn't really care when the end of the book was sort of cliffhanger
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|just started learning the game today. seems very interesting and will probably get into it once I play it some more
159463176X|5.0|Amazing. I loved how the author weaved the stories of all of the characters together. Such a great story :)<br /><br />I own Hosseini's first two novels, but I STILL have not read them. I will be getting to those soon!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is so cool I think I'm addicted to this game I really like it and besides instead of buying new dragons you can actually make them this game is definitely the best.
0142419400|3.0|So, I heard a lot of great things about this book. From people much younger than me. Who really like cutesy-cliche-love stories. And it was exactly that. Cutesy. Cliche. And some french kissing in France.<br /><br />It's not a bad story, it's just that it is hard for me to keep reading something that is SO INSANELY PREDICTABLE.<br /><br />Overall, the writing was nice and it gave me a couple of chuckles but I definitely wouldn't read it again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun to play on and I love the game and I like the characters on it love the game
0061537969|4.0|It took me a little while to get into this story. I just wasn't understanding how this book was about anything more than a dog and car racing info. Turns out, it really isn't about those things at all! I really enjoyed the camaraderie between dog and owner when faced with the biggest fight of their lives. And I adore Enzo :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|Easy to read, a bit slow in the middle, but generally fast-paced and intriguing.  A frightfully sinister glimpse of a future all too possible to achieve.
1439102813|5.0|Wow. I read this one in one sitting because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I was feeling ALL the feels with this one. I liked that it is told from the perspective of a woman that is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. I know what it's like to watch a loved one suffer from the symptoms caused by dementia, but it is another thing entirely to \\"walk in the shoes\\".<br /><br />Loved it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|nice game and time killer.  addicting.<br />more clues would make the higher levels better.<br /><br />i<br />recommend the game if you enjoy brain teasers
0525478817|5.0|Wow. I read the entire book in one afternoon because I couldn't put it down! And I was a crying, laughing idiot through most of the second half. It's not just a sad cancer story, though. These characters are just amazing and the story is so well written.<br /><br />This book definitely lives up to the hype.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have hours or fun! For you that don't like it, you should try it. You can build houses and your friends can join you. You can mine!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's quick. Wakes me up.  This is my 2nd day &amp;, I might play it all day long!  I like it.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I almost did not watch this movie due to some of the reviews I read on rotten tomatoes website. I am glad that I decided to watch this movie after review good reviews on Amazon. I am also very glad that I didn't read any of the plot, so the twist and turns in the plot added to the development to the whole story.<br /><br />My ten and twelve year-olds watched it with me and my wife and both loved the story. I told them this is what a good sci-fi movie is about, and I just made two believers from this movie.<br /><br />Great movie, and the ending is bitter sweet. We need more movies like this. Great job!
B000FA675C|5.0|This was a good read. Many twists a real page turner.<br />I never knew so many things about Leonardo. Brown had my attention from the start.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another great novel by Nelson Demille , could barely put this book down in order to go to school, work, or to even eat. John Corey has to be one of the best characters to follow. A must read!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I haven't quite finished the first book in this series, but it is awesome.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next!  So far this series seems just as good as Percy Jackson and the Olympians!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|At $35, I bought based on the high-level pitch & promise they gave on the product.  My fault for not reading all the nuances of the limitations but they are significant... other posts get into it so I won't rehash.  I think I want what most everyone wants, flip up my content to the TV from connected devices.  Thought this would get me there...
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This has been a fun app for my family.  It has worked well on our Kindle fire and we have not encountered some of the problems found in other reviews0.  I only give it 3 stars based on the<br />on the 1 star reviews, but as stated I haven't encountered this problem.  But look on the bright side, it's free and if it doesn't work what have you lost?
0142421375|1.0|I struggled to find the point to this book or even an interesting storyline. In a blind-taste test, I'd have presumed it was another Enid Blyton book.<br /><br />\\"Half the man, twice the lawyer\\"?! C'mon Hodder marketing dept - you're really reaching on that one.
B0000TAZBK|3.0|One of the corners on the cover had been dented, so it was not perfect. Otherwise the product itself was great
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I highly recommend this series. Just when you think you know where the story is headed it takes a turn in a new direction.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A love story in a non- traditional way, I have always loved flowers however after reading this book I will look at them in a completely different way.
B00932A4XE|3.0|A LOT OF BIG NAME STARS,BUT THE OUTCOME OF THE MOVIE HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.DID ENJOY SEEING THE STARS,BUT THE MOVIE BECAME BORING.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|All of his writing takes the reader to a new experience that one cannot imagine to be possible but never doubts that it is reality. It's like stepping into a history book...a history that is magical but feared to be taught. Such interesting stories all wrapped into one book. Love this author...my favorite. I can't wait for his next books!
B00390BE7G|4.0|Into the meat industry, which proves once again that on the process to feed humanity and the pockets of the huge companies we forgot to be humane.
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was in middle school, and at the time it was one of my favorite books. I've reread it many times since then, and in my most recent reading, as a college graduate, I've found just as much to love.<br /><br />Although the characters in Sabriel aren't the most deeply developed (that is to say, they have histories and feelings, but I somehow want to know more) the universe is wonderfully immersive, consisting of an \\"Old Kingdom\\" full of magic and a \\"New Kingdom\\" which is a roughly 1920s, industrialized, magic-free society - the contrast makes the magical world that much more interesting. The system of charter magic that Nix made is delightfully creative!<br /><br />As the series continues in Lirael and Abhorsen the universe becomes even more detailed (and, in my opinion, the characters more developed).<br /><br />All in all, this remains one of my favorite fantasy series today. Great universe, great story, great evil-doers, great characters. Definitely recommend it to anyone!
B0088D3PYE|4.0|Book for reading, finished it quite quickly but i couldn't avoid comparing to the &#34;Shadow of the wind&#34;, there's a thin line which repeats between the two and I find this book to be a good but not as good.
B004PLT3TY|5.0|Great little flick that our kids and us really enjoyed.  Kurt Russell is perfect for this role, and it's just a fun filled movie with just the right amount of silliness.  If your kids are between 6 and 12, they're sure to like this and it's perfect for a weekend night of movies with the family.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Makes my search quicker and I like that it saves my last search. They know how to hook people up.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game is reminiscent of Magic Academy for the PC. I love this genre of games. This one is good for children (maybe with a bit of help) as well as adult fans of the seek and find games. Unlike many I have seen for the kindle this one has a story to go with it. The games are challenging without being impossible. Well worth downloading.
0452289963|1.0|Only wished there was an option to rate this garbage with negative ratings, such as -5.  This is the only book I've ever read that had to physically meet with death by fire.  No way was I going to allow this singular copy fall into the hands of another, lest some poor impressionable soul become indoctrinated with this poison.  Tolle goes above and beyond to promote collectivism at every turn.  Denounces individualism, personal effort, responsibility & achievement.  This text is suitable for card carrying communists, socialists, Marxists, sheeple & those who ascribe to redistribution.  If you're a freedom loving individual this vile effort is not for you.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|You can't beat the price for an opportunity to watch every episode of one of the all-time classic series of all time!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A wonderfully reassuring lesson of what lies beyond from a well-educated former non-believer.  I highly recommend.  I have been at the bedside of loved ones that passed on and this book touched on questions I had based on what I witnessed with them.
B004SBX112|3.0|Randomly it will freeze on my gs3 and I will have to go and force close it but fu  otherwise
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Digitally stored media keeps my house free from the clutter associated with collecting tapes, CDs and records. Yes, I said Records!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This whole game was just cheesy. I didn't like any part of it. Waste of time. Not impressed with the graphics, look of the animals, look of the houses for the pets, and lack of options what you can do with the pets. Thoroughly hated it!
B00138KFYO|5.0|Digitally stored media keeps my house free from the clutter associated with collecting tapes, CDs and records. Yes, I said Records!<br /><br />This guys is hysterical!

B008G3N71W|5.0|Actress wants to be a star and will accept any kind of discipline to make it. Sound like Hollywood? If the censors look the other way, 'A Girl's Adventure' would make a unique movie with plenty of spanking, cropping, BDSM and pony play. This book is not vanilla, oh no, it is pure erotica and I loved it.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Digitally stored media keeps my house free from the clutter associated with collecting tapes, CDs and records. Yes, I said Records!
0385537697|5.0|I love these books. I am not an avid reader, actually can't stand to sit still and read. These books are erotic, romantic, and mysterious all rolled up into 1 book. I wasn't able to read just the first one and am now on book 3 Fifty Shades Freed. Only a few chapters in but enjoy it already.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was amazing, can't wait to start the second one. The movie doesn't do it justice. Can't wait for the second movie.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Gripping and intense from the beginning. It makes you think. As an educator, I believe every high school student should read this book.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love the look and interaction options of the new app, but the battery drain problem is serious. My kindle fire has been unplugged for 40 minutes and has  already used 7% of the battery life. I will have to uninstall until the issue is fixed.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my hubby that loves the car chases.  NOT in the book  so the movie is special.
B00634GHJA|3.0|PROs:<br /> - Despite what the description says and what the app says, you really do NOT need any additional software on your computer.  The app can serve the photos through the browser either as images or a zip file.  Click the yellow &#34;Start Here&#34; arrow button on the app.<br /> - Dropbox and other services have storage limits that might be met or exceeded.  On your computer, you are only limited by the size of your available harddrive space.<br /> - Can be a simple, effective (if not cumbersome) solution for some inexperienced users.<br /><br />CONs:<br /> - Forces portrait.  WHY????<br /> - Major Security Risk: If you do not stop the app from running in memory, anyone in the same network can connect to your tablet/phone and either upload or download images, videos, and potentially other risk-based files.  NOTE: YOU ARE RUNNING A WEB SERVER ON YOUR PHONE OR TABLET!<br /> - Uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is another security risk!  In fact, you *cannot* use HTTPS.<br /> - No automatic 'push' of photos or videos to your computer.<br /> - Uses JavaScript.<br /> - Poorly implemented transfer from computer to Android device.  Uses Flash, which can be a real problem for some and is a deprecated, proprietary technology.<br /><br />People have mentioned Dropbox, and a few other services.  Google also now offers the ability to upload photos and videos to your Google Drive [I mean Google Plus] account (free with your Gmail address).  I really love Google's and Dropbox's systems - they literally are &#34;set-and-forget&#34;, but whenever you take a photo or video, or as soon afterward that you have an internet connection, the image(s) and/or video(s) are automatically uploaded; they are usually also downloaded locally to your computer if you choose for that to happen.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Google now downsizes images/videos unless you tell it to upload originals, and then you have very limited space with them for those.  If you use these, make sure you move them from your shared folders when you are at your computer to another more permanent location.]<br />This app can be useful for beginners and inexperienced folks.  On the other hand, the other 'cloud'-based solutions really are superior if you have the space available (I simply move the photos and videos from the Dropbox folder to My Pictures or My Videos folders, which frees up space for more uploads.)<br /><br />It's a good solution, and has none of the spyware problems that have plagued many of Amazon's apps in the past.  However, it still can be a significant security risk.<br /><br />If it had the ability to automatically upload to your 'home' networked computer, I'd give it another star.  As is, it is a decent piece of software that addresses a need that less experienced users have with regards to their photos and videos.  Unfortunately, there are implementation issues that prevent this from becoming a solid recommendation.<br /><br />[EDIT: I said Google Drive.

0465022227|5.0|Young scientists and grad students have much to gain by investing a couple of days gleaning valuable advice from this relatively concise book. Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2DOOKAXLF1L8T]]Google has done it again,excellent product.I received the Chromecast dongle about an hour ago,took a few minutes to set it up .I tested it with 3 HDTVS I own and streamed Netflix using my nexus 7 tablet.The technology is simply amazing,excellent streaming quality and nice that I can multitask on nexus 7 while still streaming Netflix. Opens up a whole new world of streaming capabilities.<br />Glad I picked it up for 35.00.Highly recommend this product
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game itself is fun. But it is constantly crashing or freezing to the point I have to reset my device. It does the same on my Pc so its not just the mobile app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but when I play it I feel like I'm trapped in that chunk I would like to see an infinite terrain generation so the players can explore their world's
B00867GHS8|5.0|I originally saw this cartoon from Pixar in the movie theater. Marketed by Disney which later acquired the studio from Steve Jobs, it tells the story of an adventuresome young fish, who roams the ocean in search of his missing father, finding adventures and danger along the way.  This movie had the emotional story appeal of  Disney full length animated cartoons, like &#34;Pinnochio&#34; with more humor that appeals to adults, for example, a parody of 12 step programs where sharks struggle to overcome the temptation to eat fish. It's extensive use of computer graphics was a great step forward in animation.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is amazing, it is well made and easy to navigate around. With so may features, you can also customize your own sound!!! I highly recommend this app!!!!!
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Wish it had a digital download though.  But a worthy movie to add to my collection.  Can't wait to see Red 2.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Hate it when I am not in the mood<br />Very kool<br />Boring as hell<br />Romantic comedy central bank account do
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|Insightful, hilarious, rollicking good fun!!! A great book! The riffs on everyday life capture the absurdity of the moments precisely, and with great good humor.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very pleased with this app. Great to know how much battery life there is left to watch movies, play games, read Tec
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Still a work in progress, but plays very well! Good family fun! Looks like I need to look for some of my other favorite.
B00B4804KS|3.0|the storyline is boring for adults who had seen the original version. younger kids still love the 3d effect though
B0001I561E|5.0|Fun and funny you can watch it 100 times and it would still be fun.  Great for family time any time!
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love this game I've been ever since old updates and I've always loved this game since every single update
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love the challenge. Wish we had more time allotted. I've played this game for several months on my laptop have now downloaded it to my Kindle.  So many levels to keep the challenges going.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this is by far the beet game I have ever played. it got all sorts if things you can do and the beet part about two people can actually. play
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game the only down fall I  when you add team members to help you get items they also have to go on your Facebook acct.... there should  be a way around  this!! Also I started playing as a guest till I got a Facebook, I then signed on an  lost all my progress, if you start as a guest then connect it to Facebook your stuff should carry over...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun to run those minions! Good thing there are plenty of those yellow guys to run off cliffs!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best thing I seen for mobile apps its had a new update where can use buckets of lava and water.You can use armour know I would recommend this to everyone.PEOPLE THIS NOT A SCAM SO WORTH THE MONEY!<br /><br />Pss. Caves and and other new updates are coming SOON!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This movie looks stunning in HD, the score by Daft Punk sound amazing in the home theater. A must have if you enjoyed the original Tron.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I'm really short (5'2&#34;) and this backpack covers my entire back, shoulders to bottom. That is really my only complaint. It has enough room for multiple lens, my camera, a book, water, passport, and maps. Highly recommend!
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Didn't like the directing in this one...could have been better and more clear if more straightforward. You might like it.
1594481717|5.0|I loved the story telling this book does. It's excellently laid out in a clear argument for why you should think creatively and not just technically. I gained a fresh revelation of the power of our right brain. I'm also excited about the practical tips Daniel gives us to go out and try different parts of the book.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|I got it...but my wife fell asleep. Not well structured. Mediocre movie with great stars. Must have run out of money with the special effects.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|What a fun movie to watch. I recently found this at my local Library & knew I had to get this in Blu-ray. It has such a good cast too. I am glad they put this out in the 2:40:1 Aspect Ratio. I just enjoy the movies better when you can see the entire screen as the Director intended. Can't really comment on the Audio as I am currently using only my tv speakers. It probably is fine though. The Special Features are: Audio commentary: Deleted & Extended Scenes: {No big deal here} & something called Access Red which sends me back to Audio Commentary. Special Features aren't all that important to me as much as the quality of the movie being watched. The Blu-ray is quite good compared to the picture on my dvd. This movie puts a smile on my face every time I watch it. Glad I got it in Blu-ray.
B008NW67E0|5.0|The best thing about this album - the fact that if you are of the singing persuasion you can always add an extra line of harmony on top or below.  It's somehow much more satisfying that just singing along with the main melody.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I am sure you know if you Love this Movie you will have this in your collection . Twilight Fans will Love it
0804165734|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this book and when I came across the audio book I was HUGELY disappointed that so much of the book had been cut out of the audio version. So many great pieces of this epic story missing!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Buy the book and read along with this full version audio book.<br /><br />You're welcome.
B003K15IF8|4.0|Not sure how this book slipped under my radar all these years, especially since it is set at my alma mater.  Couldn't put it down.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was all sex and no story line. The first two books were good. I couldn't make myself finish this one. I gave up at 60%. Wouldn't recommend.
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|All the songs that got stuck in your head are on here, but seems to get broken up unnaturally by slow songs from the movie
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Five finger death punch has made another great album. The songs are great and the album has a little bit of everything. The live album is also great.
B00BUT5I84|4.0|The music is great, but 30STM keeps moving further and further away from their roots. This has heavy use of electronica to drive the tracks. Why can't they do something similar to their first album?
B005JTAP4S|5.0|William O'Brien's \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale\\" is a whimsical novel which is narrated like a fairy tale, creating a world which is childlike but not childish.<br /><br />Masterfully written, it has great imagery and pacing and intriguing characters. In the story, O'Brien introduces us to Peter, a caring, cautious yet adventurous young man with a particular perspective on the world.<br /><br />For example, here is Peter's interpretation of taxidermy: \\"One of the rooms, which had the word Taxidermy on the door, was full of glass cases with dead animals inside. Apparently, people used to like to rip the innards out of animals and have them stuffed with something or other.\\"<br /><br />The book is full of fascinating characters with mischievous names like Seebright, a bird, and Mr Twindle Twondle, a mouse, and a fungus who lives House of Golden Mushrooms, just to mention a few. Like any good writer, William O'Brien takes the time to develop both the characters and the world at large before plunging into the action. As a result, once Peter is swept away into the magical world, we as the readers become privately involved with Peter, his adventures and troubles.<br /><br />William O'Brien's \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale\\" is appropriate for both children and adults and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of books like C.S. Lewis' \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and Selma Lagerlof's \\"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils.\\"
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|this book doesent make sense at all and i need to read another good book thats not by jeff kinney and THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|I got this for use on my motorcycling gloves.  I NEVER ride without them and am tired of needing to pull off the road and remove my glove to manipulate my garmin or my phone instead of simply adjusting the devices at a red light or similar.  Seems to work well so far, I'll be interested in seeing how long this treatment lasts.<br /><br />It says only for use on dark color leather gloves, but the compound is not just dark, it's black.  Fine on my black gauntlets, not so good on other &#34;dark&#34; colors.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|I have loved this movie since high school, when my teacher showed it to the class. It has made such a great impact on me! It shows the many faces of the globe, and the many speeds life moves in. It's taught me to try and slow down and enjoy every little moment, and to take care of the place I live in, to preserve it for my daughter and her future!
0064471837|5.0|If you are looking for a great young adult fantasy, this is it! Sabriel tells the story of a girl who is forced to leave the comfort of the life she's known her whole life to travel into a dark, mysterious land to rescue her missing father. She encounters unimaginable dangers, finds strength within herself, and manages to make some friends along the way. While very dark in its subject matter, Sabriel is definitely suitable for younger readers (age 10-11+). I first read this book when I was in middle school (almost 15 years ago)and I can honestly say that this book is the reason I have a passion for reading to this day. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I loved this film.  I enjoy films based on true stories.  Some of the scenes were somewhat difficult to watch (\\"That's the reality of war,\\" I told myself).  This film is well worth it.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
0345529057|5.0|As a big fan of the Game of Thrones TV series on HBO I bought these books. They books are  slow paced and much more detailed oriented. I reccomend reading them before watching the show. You wont regret it.
B008MM9630|5.0|Love this game..so much fun it's one of the good ones! I have had no issues so far. You cab pick up Jens and money pretty quickly.
B0039O8AQK|3.0|Pretty good movie for how old it is. I just read the book and wanted to see how the movie was because I loved the book. The movie in no way lives up to the book, but is still interesting. Im sad that they didn't show his transformation so much in the end of how he loved big brother and the party with all his heart and then was shot.
B008BTC5E6|2.0|This book is about Scott Jurek - starts and ends with him. If you want to gain any tips about running, this is not the book. Some tips about nutrition, but those are really not for ordinary mortals. It's almost like spending 2-3 hours on preparing those dishes. While I'm also a vegetarian, I think for ordinary people like me, I can find good substitutes. The cooking recipes are meaningless too. If you are looking for motivation, this is not the book for you. Scott Jurek is no ordinary runner - he was born with exceptional abilities. There are much better books out there if you want to get some tips on long distance running.
0064471837|5.0|Years ago I stumbled across Sabriel on a library bookshelf. Little did I know that it would set the standard for readable, engrossing, and superb fantasy.<br /><br />Nix does world-building in a way that reads effortlessly and opens up a million windows into a unique and fascinating universe. When I discovered it was part of a trilogy I was thrilled.<br /><br />This is the first book in the series, focused on a world split in half, on one side of the wall is a relatively normal early-modern nation, on the other side a kingdom of magic. In this novel we follow the titular character as she walks from one world to another. The plot runs at just the right speed, building into a fantastic story written flawlessly.<br /><br />Most novels exploring a unique world fall into the trap of spending too much time trying to explain how it all works. Nix doesn't make that mistake, instead he imbues the work with a wonderful narrative flow, the likes of which I've rarely seen in any genre. The same is true in his characters, who build and grow naturally in the work, resulting in some of the more memorable literary personalities I've encountered. The result is an almost addictive read.<br /><br />There are few books I can recommend more highly than Sabriel. You should read it. Right now.

0061122416|4.0|Was told it was interesting by my 17 year old but haven't read it for myself.  It was hard to get what the book was about from them so I'm not sure if I need to rush to read it.

B00065EB2M|5.0|You know this product or products from Spacecraft Films<br />deserves an easy 5 stars as every aspect of the mission is covered<br />in great detail. The video product is top notch especially the<br />different multi-angle shots of the beautiful nighttime launch. Another<br />great video shot in great color is the final liftoff from the Moon of<br />the LEM back to the Command Module. This is one of my favorite sets.<br />I have just about all their titles: some you can only can get<br />thru their website. They are now producing Blu- Rays on some of there<br />titles like Live From the Moon.

B008JFUO4U|1.0|Another boring SiFi movie. Take parts of Blade Runner, The Matrix and Screamers; make it look like Prometheus; give Tom Cruise some sex scenes where he can emote and prove that he is hetro, than you have Oblivion. I felt I was in oblivion watching this movie.

0738737909|5.0|just received received my new Tarot Illuminati Deck, and allow me to say \\"This Deck is simply beautiful and magical\\" Eric Dunn seems to have the \\"Midas Touch\\" and is a true master of his craft. The illustrations and symbology in each card are simply magical. The printer, Lo Scarabeo and has done an absolutely superb job in executing the manufacture of extremely high quality reproductions of Eric's art. From the vibrancy of color, illumination of gold \\"light\\", and heavy weight/gold-edged card stock, is particularly exquisite. I can't say enough about the quality of this kit. The box that the deck comes in holds the same quality as the cards themselves. Kim Huggen's companion book is simply beautiful, and her words illuminate each card illustrated in vibrant color. I am so pleased to have this deck. I'm not writing this to advertise, I am writing this to share my sense of awe at the beauty and quality of this beautiful deck. I look forward to years of use and the professional presentation this deck has the potential of delivering each reading. Thank you to each party involved in successfully launching this deck to an eager market![[ASIN:0738737909 Tarot Illuminati Kit]]

B00CH87HF4|1.0|It is stupid. the kids have to buy items to even play it. How do I delete this? It is disgusting!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This hidden object game has plenty to do. There are a variety of puzzles including spot the difference. Many of the logic puzzles are challenging with the safety net of a hint button. Magic Academy 2 is very enjoyable.

0399159347|4.0|I usually read historical fiction, but decided to change it up a bit and read this book. I really enjoyed it. I could relate to all of the female characters in one way or another. If they did not remind me of myself, then I knew someone like them. The book is quite funny at times, but tragic as well. I moved very quickly through the book. It has a great plot, well written, fast pace.

B000EPE7AK|1.0|I received my dvd on time.  My daughter was very happy to see that the dvd was<br />here but then trying to play the dvd my dvd player would not play this dvd said it need a code. I trying emailing the seller they said yes you need a code for the US and you can play it on your computer!<br /> I thought that was bad news for my 4year old kid. Next time make sure you don't order from International.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|first the good:<br />nice graphics and art<br />very long game play<br />lots of puzzles<br />clever hidden object puzzles<br />good story<br /><br />the bad:<br />glitchy touch controls ruin game. many times I could not place the object even though I knew exactly where it went and was unable to pick up items correctly frequently.<br />some puzzles were obscure what one had to do with the result it became a blind drag and drop routine.<br />voice acting by the lead actress was so horrid I almost quit due to that.<br />the static image with only the mouth moving to simulate talking was distracting. think monty python cartoons. would have been better to just have a painting without the lame animatiion.<br /><br />I didn't have a problem with the long storyline. it was easy to skip thru whenever you wanted. the last puzzle of memorized pattern to fight the demon was hampered by the overly bright light animation which actually masked the lights you were supposed to memorize. had to skip puzzle in frustration.<br /><br />overall a good offering for the genre but ruined by poor touch controls. fix that and my rating will go up a star.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Breathing, story telling at it's finest. A book that has everything in it to keep you from being able to put it down. Love, hatred, and treachery abound
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Love this game. It helps keep reaction time sharp. It would be helpful to have more directions in menu.  If you run into a glitch just reinstall. You don't lose your score. It happens everytime I travel.

B004EPYZPS|3.0|All I can say is that you never know what's going to happen in this life. This movie is an example of what could really happen. I gave it 3 stars because it could of been a little bit better done. I never give the plot away in my reviews. But it is worth the money to buy and watch it. I try to be fair in all my reviews.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|If only everyone could have a Bob in their life.  James and Bob are two lucky souls.  Fun, fast, and unforgettable.  Yay Bob!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|This was a good movie for all science fiction fans of all kinds. I'm not going to give away the story. But let me say it was a good flick for the now times. (Up to date) So if your a science fiction fan like many of us. Then I'm sure you will like this movie. I's Worth giving it a shot
0757302661|5.0|I really loved this book. I thought there would be more hypnosis techniques, but that is only a short part of the book. I enjoyed reading about the history of childbirth and why women should not be afraid to do what their body was made to do. It really eased my mind and made me feel confident about giving birth. It makes sense that when you are afraid your body tenses up and therefore has a harder time giving birth.
B0082KPF32|5.0|I've found myself growing tired and bored of metal as of late. Perhaps this is because I've listened to basically nothing besides over the past decade. Regardless, I came upon Ne Obliviscaris quite by accident, listened to the title track, and was immediately enthralled by the haunting violin, proficient guitar, oppositional vocals, and the tightly constructed, indeed quite moving overall sound. Since then, I have bought the album and listened to its entirety many times over; and although I have since moved on to other bands, I look forward to their next offering. It was quite the refreshing experience to find a band that so effortlessly combined a new instrumental element into the stale compound that makes up most metal experiences.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Nice casual puzzles are able to continue through long cut scenes if you dont care about the story.  Worth the $3.00
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A great ending that summed up exactly my questions, fears and angst. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this captivating series and this continuation of the GOT.
1416596097|1.0|A friend of mine who took part in the invasion of Iraq put it simply.  'You may not like everything about the USA but who else do you want as top dog?' When he wrote 'Tinker Tailor' le Carré seemed aware of this, and let's not forget that Nixon was in power and the Vietnam war was coming to a close. There is much that is dreadful about America and, of course, the British establishment can be awful - we Brits can be the most shocking hypocrites, and self-delusion, often in the form of delusions of grandeur,  is one of our major weaknesses, but somehow one feels that le Carré has lost his sense of proportion and indeed his sense of humor and this book reads like a rant.  Don't get me wrong.  Sorry, it is not a bad book, and deserves more than one star, but who reads two or three star reviews? Sadly Le Carré has not come up with a truly great book since 'A Perfect Spy'.  He has become too predictable; there is just too much 'baddies and victims' and he seems unable to come up with great characters like Ricki Tarr and Toby Esterhase.  After a few minutes watching him on Sky Arts at the Hay Literary Festival, surrounded by an adulatory audience which seemed to share his (in my view naive) 'Weltanschauung' I just switched channels and watched 'Man v. Food' instead. He was such a great author, and nobody can take that achievement away from him, but every dog has his day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was fun not too hard not too busy. . ..I WANT MORE!! I will definitely wait for more levels to be added.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is the best Uno game I have played. I love that you can play with your friends. I just wish I could play more hands without spending real money or waiting. I guess the in game ads must not pay enough.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Show is about the controversial topic of cloning-it brings up some interesting points, but it's very character driven. The main character does a mostly fantastic job of portraying different people (clones). The writers were smart-the clones she couldn't pull off, they get rid of-so she ends up doing the ones that fit her best. I enjoyed it and I look forward to see where season 2 goes.

B00B4804KS|3.0|After watching AVATAR in 3D blu-ray, Jurassic Park was a let-down. Of course, I realize that Avatar was filmed in 3D where Jurassic Park was just a remake, but I was really expecting better. Had I heard this, I wouldn't have purchased this and I have the Digital Copy already and I feel this was a complete waste of money. Guess I should have check other reviews....

B009EANE3M|3.0|Some songs are good, some are okay. I was expecting a little more from them, but it is still a good album overall. I do not feel like I wasted my money.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Nah. Pet Shop Boys never lost their form.  They are and always have been brilliant song writers and performers.  They're by far the best and most talented of the bands that came out of the '80's. Their albums have always been what I guess I would call a mixed bag.  And by that I don't mean a mixed bag of good and bad.  I mean a mixed bag of interesting concepts.  They haven't followed one style slavishly thereby running it into the ground.  They make albums that are interesting to them.  Albums which reflect what they find interesting or important to them at the time of recording. Albums that seem to reflect a different part of their personalities each time. And they've always made albums that have been interesting to me.  Be it something personal and reflective like Release and Elysium, their two most underrated albums both of which are personal favorites of mine, or albums full of banging, accessible dance pop like Very, and this new release, Electric.  Electric is the most consistent and outstanding work that I've heard from any pop artists in a looooong time. There's no filler to be found on it anywhere.  All nine tracks are the work of confident, mature artists who don't have to prove that they're still &#34;relevant&#34; and &#34;hip&#34;.  They don't have to stoop to gimmicks like posing with their legs spread, or making clumsy, uncomfortable appearances at music festivals where they ask the crowd if they have drugs, like another '80's icon who shall be nameless *cough cough MADONNA cough cough MADONNA*.  Because they never stopped being relevant and hip.  Just listen to the confidence present in every track.  They knew exactly what they wanted to accomplish here and they've pulled it off in a magnificent style indeed.  No, this is not a &#34;return to form&#34;. It's just the latest in a long string of brilliantly conceived pop music masterpieces by the two guys who absolutely own the genre.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love their beats and mix of style. My children love radioactive and request it every time we drive. I definitely recommend this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It's addictive and the<br /> graphics are awesome!<br />This is something anyone and everyone can play and enjoy.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My kids and I have watched this movie several times.  It is extremely entertaining and just never seems to get old!  I would definitely recommend it!
B00BEXB18M|3.0|Megadeth has always been a band i loved but when they release material like this, i question that love. While tracks like Super collider, Kingmaker and my favorite Beginning of sorrow drive the album other tracks like Dance in the rain bring the album to a complete stop. Like most fans im hoping for another Rust in peace or even another Countdown to extinction but sadly, i dont think thats ever going to happen):  Thanx for reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. From ages 36 to age 2, we all enjoy it. Just as good as the movie if not better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game so much I can't stay away from it every extra time I have  I'm on this game! It is very exciting to unlock new Alford and other awesome stuff!

0451209338|4.0|This is the first volume of Silva's popular Gideon Allon spy novels and its an excellent thriller. Allon is an art restorer who is also an Israeli spy and assassin. He's a moody character with good reason--his wife and child were murdered as a result of his spying activities. Silva plants Allon somewhere between the action spies like Matt Helm and James Bond and the ponderous, little action spies like those in John Le Carre's novels. The result is a near perfect blend of action and suspense along with thoughtful observations on international politics.<br /><br />For my money, the most interesting character in the novel is the female protagonist--the beautiful French model who also helps out as an Israeli spy. When she appears in the  story, things really began to take off. Silva provides lots of plot twists, exotic settings and plenty of suspense and I can't wait to read the next installment in the series. A really fun read.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I was not sure what to expect with this because I came into it not knowing anything more about the story than we had another future-earth-aftermath-of-some-event movie.  Generally we find what makes a movie \\"unique\\" within the first third so that the last 2/3 can be packed with action, chase, and very expected twists.  In this case the movie may seem slow but they are really making us work for the twist and it's pretty great when it lands.  Very solid flick.
0385523394|2.0|Not at all an exciting book and her crude and disgusting language  Kinda ruined it for me. Can't imagine how it became a movie , or whatever it  is.
B009ZQJ0ME|4.0|The gun-kata aspect was something that they could have developed more.Most of the fight scenes were well done. Action fans should give it a spin.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|loved the story loved the characters loved the moral of the story as well must collect w/others like Miss Potter
B000OVLINI|5.0|Could not but this book down. The intertwining of the characters, the heart break and the love of family and friends, the mystery.  Who would have thought with all of the fear,hate and death that this could have had the ending it does.  A wonderful mystery, story of family, fiends and hope in the future. Loved the characters of Daniel and his true friend Fermin.
014241543X|4.0|After a car accident leaves Mia in a coma, she starts to think about what life holds for her. Her parents are gone and some of the choices she has to make seem to be just too hard to even think about considering. But as the machines keep her body alive, her spirit walks the halls of the hospital seeing the people she loves and reminiscing about days gone past. With college looming and having decide between the love she has for music and the boy that holds her heart, Mia needs to decide. If she goes she can be with her family... but if she stays? Well that remains a mystery.<br /><br />This is one of those devastating stories about loss and love. And I adored the way love was portrayed in this novel. Not necessarily the love between main character Mia and her boyfriend Adam but the love between families. Mia's parents were shown though flashbacks to be supportive and generous in the way they felt about each other and their children. Their passion for music and life was infectious. Despite these characters not being present in the present tense, reading their interactions through Mia's memories were one of my favourite parts of the book. Like wise the love shown between friends - like Kim and Willow.<br /><br />I found it hard to engage with Mia - but considering she was disconnected from the world I'm not surprised that I was disconnected from her. Even though her flashbacks I found her to be a little standoffish and lacking the vibrant energy in which she describes her family and friends as having. That said, her narration does deliver a well rounded and full picture into her life and her music. Her relationship with music and love was beautifully written and I thought it was a very interesting way to look at the world.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written novel about love and life. It kind of snuck up on me. I didn't think I was into this story but I started to tear up during one of the scenes (it was the one when Gramps came in to talk to Mia) and I had to reach for the tissues. I've heard such great things about Gayle Forman's books and I'm so glad that I decided to read one. I will definitely be on the look out to read more from this fantastic YA author.

B005UG542S|5.0|There was a boy... A very strange enchanted boy....And for ten years, the world watched Daniel Radcliffe inhabit the role of J.K. Rowling's formidable young literary hero, taking him from a sweet, wide-eyed waif, just beginning to learn about his past and find his unique place in a world previously unknown to him for most of his life to a complex young man with increasing skill and courage, as well as a very noble character as he comes closer and closer to his final \\"High Noon\\" moment with the Dark Lord(Ralph Fiennes), who has unsuccessfully tried to kill him since he was a year old.<br /> The final film begins where the penultimate one left off... With Voldemort(whose name means \\"Fly of Death\\") re-activating the Elder Wand, and Harry, Ron(Rupert Grint) and Hermione(Emma Watson, whose attractive heart-shaped visage is in dramatic contrast to the plump bisque-doll face  she had in the first film) grieve the loss of Dobby(Toby Jones), while inside the Weasley Family beach house, used as a safehouse by remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, Bill and Fleur Weasley(Domhall Gleeson and Clemence Poesy) tend to wandseller, Mr. Ollivander(John Hurt), the goblin, Griphook(Warwick Davis), and Luna Lovegood(Evanna Lynch).<br /> In speaking with Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn why Bellatrix Lestrange(Helena Bonham Carter) with whom Hermione and Griphook had especially brutal encounters at Malfoy Manor, thought the Sword of Griffyndor should be in her vault at Gringott's Bank(where Griphook worked), and learn of the possibility of finding another horcrux there.<br /> Having acquired a strand of Bellatrix's hair, Hermione uses it in polyjuice potion to disguise herself as Voldemort's female counterpart  before she, Ron(who will also be incognito), Harry and Griphook disapparate to Gringott's to search for the items. Harry and Griphook travel beneath Harry's invisibility cloak, and Ron blasts an elixir to with the favor of a goblin banker to help reach their destination. They bypass a sleeping dragon , which guards the vault, but the geminal curse, in which everything they touch multiplies, results  in an overabundance of silver cups just like the desired horcrux appearing, nearly burying them. In a scene vindicating Hagrid's(Robbie Coltrane) warning about goblins being clever but unfriendly during Harry's first year at Hogwarts, Griphook pulls a double cross as the guards close in on them  with wands blazing, leading Hermione to come up with a daring escape plan via the dragon guarding the vaults, demolishing the front area of the bank and incinerating some of the bankers who were unable to flee. Unlike the book, Griphook's fate is better defined in the film as the sword of Griffyndor, his desired reward for helping the three teens get into the vault, disappears from his grasp.<br /> At the risk of being seen by Muggles, the three fly away from London on the back of the newly released dragon, dropping into a lake as the wyvern flies away. During their submersion, Harry's scar burns and he has telltale seizures and visions. As they climb ashore, he tells Ron and Hermione that Voldemort knows their whereabouts and is scared and angry, and that he has also seen  the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly MacDonald), and surmised that the next horcrux may be found at Hogwarts, and that it has something to do with Ravenclaw Tower. Ron reminds him that Snape(Alan Rickman) in now Headmaster and they'll have to find an alternate entrance into the school. Harry reminds Hermione of how their plans always go awry when she recommends taking time to strategize slowly.<br /> Disapparating from a green area to the snowy village of Hogsmeade, they narrowly escape snatchers as Alberforth Dumbledore(Ciaran Hinds), who had sent Dobby to rescue them from Malfoy Manor, gives them refuge in the tavern he tends and advises them against an exercise in futility in hunting for more horcruxes. Harry disagrees with Alberforth, and his show of determination leads Alberforth to speak to his dead sister, Arianna's(Hebe Beardshall)portrait. The schoolgirl walks mysteriously into the background, and then returns with someone, who, as the door behind the portrait opens, is revealed to be Neville(Matthew Lewis), who escorts them through a new secret passage into the castle, explaining why it is not featured on the Marauder's Map, how Hogwarts was fairing with Snape as Headmaster, as well as the influence of the sadistic Amycus and Alecto Carrow(Ralph Ineson and Suzanne Toase), the brother and sister in charge of discipline. The course formerly known as Defense Against the Dark Arts is now known as simply the Dark Arts, and the Carrows bruised Neville for refusing to practice the Cruciatus Curse (which incapacitated his own parents)on First Year Students.<br />  Harry is greeted with applause by his friends and roommates when they enter the chamber where the boats are kept. He announces their search for an unknown object. When he mentions its possible association with Ravenclaw House, Luna mentions that it may be Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem. In a moment where she literally takes Harry's breath away, Ginny( Bonnie Wright)appears, seeing Harry for the first time in six months, and warns him that Snape knows of his whereabouts.<br /> The staff and entire student body are made to dress in full uniform, and march to the Great Hall to be admonished by Snape about hiding information about Harry's whereabouts, demanding those in the know to reveal whatever information they may have and threatening severe penalties for failure to divulge such information. Harry, dressed in a student's robe over casual clothes steps from the ranks to reveal himself and angrily confront Snape about his audacity in taking Dumbledore's place and demanding that he reveal himself as Dumbledore's murderer. Both draw wands. McGonagall(Maggie Smith) takes her place by Harry's side as the Carrows back Snape. McGonagall takes out the Carrows as Snape disapparates through the stained glass window. Students cheer what is only a temporary victory as a celebratory McGonagall lights up the cauldron lanterns.<br />  All too soon, Harry falters  as Voldemort's satanic hissing, demanding Hogwarts will be left untouched if Harry surrenders himself, and that those who turn Harry over to him will be rewarded. Slytherin student Pansy Parkington (Scarlet Byrne) demands that someone grab Harry, who in turn, is defended by his friends.<br />  Upon Filch's (David Bradley) arrival, McGonagall demands he escort the counterproductive Slytherins to the dungeons, giving the other students one more reason to applaud before everyone must prepare for war.<br /> McGonagall  beckons the relief statues into animation to guard the campus boundaries as Flitwick (Warwick Davis), Slughorn( Jim Broadbent), and Molly Weasley(Julie Walters) send a defensive shield into the night sky, in an episode  highly reminiscent of the Battle of Britain.<br /> As Voldemort and followers wait on a distant hillside, Luna successfully urges Harry to confer with Helena Ravenclaw's ghost to find the next horcrux. The Order of the Phoenix members position themselves around the castle as Ron and Hermione destroy the cup from the vault at Gringott's  in the Chamber of Secrets. In the process, the romance of the young and often bickering couple is permanently sealed.<br /> Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) confronts Harry in the Room of Requirement, along with two cohorts as he locates the diadem. Draco demands the return of his wand, wrested by Harry at Malfoy Manor as Harry wonders why he didn't confirm his identity to Bellatrix. Draco explains that his mother's borrowed wand doesn't quite understand him, revealing that in many ways he is torn between the will of his parents and his own conscience, making him the story's most pitiable character.Goyle(Josh Herdman) urges Draco to kill Harry, But Ron and Hermione intervene. A battle ensues and Harry has to retrieve the diadem from amound of brick-a-brack , from which Cornish pixies fly out. He retrieves it as the notoriously hysterical Ron grabs Hermione as Goyle accidentally ignites the room.In the end the diadem is destroyed but only two of Harry's detractors are saved.<br /> Another seizure and vision  reveal the impact of their actions on Voldemort as well as the last remaining horcrux.<br />Seamus Finnegan (Devon Murray) and Neville help rig one of the bridges to the school with explosives, and the latter risks his life to bring about the desired result of this action.<br /> As the battle heats up, giants and death eaters descend upon the castle. Large spiders attack the courtyard, and Alberforth creates a shield when the dementors arrive, allowing the three main combatants to hurry to the astronomy tower to scout out Voldemort and the last horcrux.<br /> Through hazy stainglass windows, the trio witness the unforeseen results of Snape's chat with the Dark Lord. As Voldemort and Nagini disappear, the mortally wounded Snape urges Harry to take his tears to the pensieve, making a final and curious utterance about Harry having his mother's eyes....<br /> The Dark Lord gives Harry an ultimatum to turn himself over to him. But the three young combatants go to the Great Hall where they inspect the casualties, many of whom Harry held dear, including two who leave behind an infant son in a tragedy that parallels Harry's.<br /> Trekking over to the pensieve, Harry declassifies what Snape wanted him to know. With his views of the dour headmaster forever altered by profound revelations, he sits for a while, overwhelmed, but certain of the course of action he must take.<br /> Soon he rises, and as he exits Hogwarts for what may be the last time, he comforts a sorrowing Ron and Hermione, pleading with them to destroy the last horcrux.<br /> At the entrance to the forest, Harry has his Gethsemene moment. His golden snitch opens to reveal a Resurrection stone, enabling him to see and speak with a few of his beloved departed, drawing strength from their words before he goes on.<br /> As the Dark Lord and Death Eaters wait, with the captured Hagrid tied to a tree, Harry calmly approaches....<br /> While all seems at its darkest at this point, and those who fought to protect Harry fear all will end in heartbreak, viewers will see how Rowling's work will end with life-affirming triumph.<br /> We will watch a young boy(Arthur Bowen) whose initials interestingly enough, form the word, \\"ASP\\", follow in the footsteps of his forbears, joining his older brother (William Dunn), and cousin(Helena Barlow) on a rare and unusual journey, with a sister( Daphne De Bestingui) and another cousin (Ryan Turner )waiting in the wings.<br /> And so the saga ends, and yet begins anew. Assuming she is still at her post as Headmistress, we wish McGonagall well in dealing with  another generation of the Potter-Granger-Weasley combination, and know, that with them around, life at Hogwarts will never be dull.

B008602KQI|2.0|Before I being my review, I want it to be said I did not buy this movie from Amazon but from a store and also saw it in theaters.  With that being said I looked forward to seeing this movie after having read the book and was sorely, sorely disappointed.  There are so many things this movie missed or could have done better.  First, the editing was not well executed.  It looked choppy and felt forced.  Second, the chemistry between Lawerence and Hutchinson was non-existent and forced.  If you've read the book you know why the lack of chemistry is a problem.  Thirdly, the mockingjay pin really bugs me.  The way they did it takes away from the story and doesn't add to it.  There is so much more back story to the pin with Madge than without and the fact they completely left it out bothers me.  Finally, and I can't really blame this on the director but you never get to know what was really going on in Katniss' head.  The movie makes her look like a perfect hero when in reality her morality is questionable.  If you've read the book you know what I am talking about.  Also, you understand from her inner battles and personality why she ends up with who she ends up with at the end of the series.  All in all the movie was a bust and failed to hit on what were key points.  Hopefully with a new director in tow things will be better.  Despite my qualms with this movie I will see the next one with the hope that it will be better and do the movie justice.

B00005Q66Y|4.0|My first recording of the Bruckner 8th symphony was conducted by Jascha Horenstein on the old Vox label.  Then I purchased von Karajan's interpretation and finally I added Bohm transcription to my collection.  In each recording, despite the engineering or the age of the recording, I find little things that tend to distinguish one conductor's insights and orchestral playing from another.  I recommend Bohm's work here together with the aforementioned artists' vision of this monumental work.
1400067820|3.0|After hearing some of the interviews of Nassim Taleb during his book tour, I was totally intrigued by the topic and arguments of this book.  Seriously, he's on to something quite profound.<br /><br />As a published author myself, I know how hard it is to get your mind around big non-fiction topics.  Unfortunately, Taleb has tried to cover too much here.  The book is simultaneously too long (and disorganized) to be a good read and too short (with critical parts of the argument edited out) to be a magnum opus.  I consider myself pretty good at absorbing complex economic, business, and math topics, but after finishing this book too little of the good stuff \\"stuck.\\"<br /><br />This is a pity, as Taleb's arguments are not just well reasoned, they are wise and meaningful.  It is possible that if you had read and fully absorbed The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, this book would be easy to understand and integrate.  I'll try that in a few weeks...but in the mean time, the novice reader may find the style and construction of this book to be somewhat irritating.  Still worth reading, but not a truly memorable book.
0399160450|5.0|My husband has read all of the Tom Clancy books.  He said that he really liked this book alot, because it follows along with the plots from the other books. He also said that even though there are many different plots through this book it was easy to follow along since he likes the changes that Clancy normally puts in the books.<br />For all of the Tom Clancy fans I would suggest reading this book.  It is that good.<br /><br />Thank you so much for a wonderful book, Amazon.!!!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This was the faotd earlier this week.  The game play is easy to understand and flows very well.  You can choose your color palate for play an I noticed there is even a color blind mode in the options section.<br /><br />The idea is similar to Tetris, clear the rows.  What is different is that you don't rotate anything,  instead you slide either a new piece or one that has already fallen.<br /><br />This game is addictive and saved when you exit so you can pick up where you left off with it.

0321811984|5.0|I needed it for my class. I enjoyed reading it as well. Love the layout of the book. I got an A in the class!
B00C2IGQEW|5.0|I had already owned the departed on regular dvd but decided it was a must have on Blu Ray ! Plays great, crystal clear picture... Only downfall is the product doesn't come with any paperwork inside which is part of the reason I bought it new, other than that it was well worth the 10 bucks (considering it retails for 26.99 at walmart)
B008JFUN50|4.0|Did you see \\"District 9?\\" I did. I found it audacious and memorable, so I've been looking forward to \\"Elysium\\" ever since I discovered Neill Blomkamp was the director. In this one, it is the year 2154 and only the rabble continues to live in squaller on a ruined Earth; the wealthy live on an orbiting space station called Elysium, where equality is the last thing on their minds...sort of like a gated community...<br /><br />On both habitats, the residents speak a polyglot of English, Spanish, French, and other assorted tongues. When the dialogue isn't in English, there are captions to help us out. (A person who speaks three languages is trilingual; two languages, bilingual; one language, American.)<br /><br />Look at this cast:<br />  * Matt Damon (The \\"Bourne\\" franchise) is Max, a former felon determined to meet the terms of his parole and stay out of jail. He has never forgotten his little playmate Frey, now grown up and a medico in the chaos of Earth.<br />  * Alica Braga (\\"On the Road\\") is Frey; even though she's a doctor, the equipment to cure her daughter of acute leukemia is up on Elysium and she has no legal way to get there.<br />  * Diego Luna (\\"Casa de mi Padre\\") is Julio, Max's loyal friend.<br />  * Jodie Foster (\\"The Beaver\\") is Delacourt, the Frenchwoman in charge of security on Elysium. She takes her job very, very seriously.<br />  * Sharlto Copley (\\"The A-Team\\") is Kruger, Delacourt's enforcer.<br /><br />We see a large, capable cast. The horrific industrial accident that causes our hero to have radiation poisoning feels authentic and his subsequent medical treatment made me hide my eyes.<br /><br />This is an R-rated actioner, so expect oodles of profanity and a lot of gun play, plus endless fisticuffs and blowie uppie stuff. There are no sweaty bodies but Damon can convey affection with just a crooked smile.<br /><br />Of course we see almost non-stop Computer Generated Imaging...sigh...but the ramshackle vehicles, both land and air made me thinkof \\"Mad Max.\\"<br /><br />Note: Key bits of dialogue are difficult to understand, so if you have any hearing concerns, find a theater with closed captions or wait for the DVD from Amazon.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis has confirmed my theory that we are being invaded by UK and Aussie Actors.  This was a dramatic movie and Mr. Day-Lewis deserved every award possible.  apparently this is an invasion that I am totally enjoying.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  If you loved shades of grey, then you will love this book.  Its seems to be more mature and has a better storyline
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is just like real uno, but you can buy boosts with uno tokens to help you out. You will get them after every game. The only disclaimer is you need 2 uno tokens to play each game. You will get a daily scratch off to win 2-5 coins. Also every time you level up you will get a coin. I love this game it's free, fun, and everything you want in uno. You should download this now, if you don't like it then delete it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This cd is one of my favorites.  Bruno has some sexy songs on here!  There isn't one bad song, which we all should know by now
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A legal thriller. A story of parent's love for a child.  Genetic theory and complex family relationships.  Twists and turns that made this a captivating story from start to finish.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I did a lot of research on different types of waterproof mp3 players for lap swimming. I decided on this one and am so glad that I did. It is very user friendly and the sound is amazing. The unit stays put even in flip turns and fast sprints. I love it!!
B009MF5BXK|3.0|The cinematic equivalent to a fast food meal.  Enjoyable enough while you are watching it but completely forgotten five minutes after you've digested it.  Lots of flying ammo and bloodless slaughter.  Can't forget the explosions.  Things blow up real good here.  Characterization?  The principal actors(Stallone, Statham, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Norris, et al) riff on their screen personae but not very memorably.  Wait for this one to pop up on cable instead of investing your hard earned dough.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|When you see this game to some it looks boring but it's cool, you get to build your own park and get dragons. It is really fun you should give it a try.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I did not like this film. It was disorganized, very confusing, bad writing. One should not have to watch it more than once to try to uderstand it better. I really respect and enjoy these actors, Cruise, Freeman, but just not in this film. In this film they are tru heros with heart, but if I may, there was at least one segment where Freeman's character goes on a long speech like talk, solo, and all cast remain quiet as a mouse. I thought, this character is full of himself and likes hearing himself talk. It was similar to listening to him narrate a documentary. The producers should have cut that piece out to make him more likeable. The brunette actres, Olga, is so very pretty, her face and hair especially in this one, but she had very few words, it left me thinking perhaps she needs to work on her acting skills. In another film she played a silent warrior woman, I forget the title, it was pre middle ages timeline, she starred with Michael Fastbender, she nailed that role, great acting despite no words. She was good in that Bond film too. The plot in this Oblivion film to me was poorly done, too hard to follow, you had to work hard to understand, leaving you tired, with headache, wondering if this was a time and money waste to watch. In fact, on several occasions I often thought the film was about to end and it appeared to be winding down, and also it was dull, I think I was hoping it would end, it dragged on and on. If I knew what it was like, I would not have seen it even if for free. There was only one segment I liked, when Cruise was driving a small aircraft and was being chased by other craft, there was shooting between them, that was very exicting, but ended with an impossible scenario leaving me as a viewer insulted by the writers. The two main female characters were very easy on the eyes. Oh, and to top off the not so good on this film, was a silly female character with a southern accent which sounded very fake. She was somewhat of a manager role, wizard like,only seen on a tiny screen, calling the shots, but very unlikable, worse acting; again, if this film is very futuristic, it made you think, since in this film, earth is not the earth we once knew, then how in the world can one develop a southern accent if there is no such thing as the south; in fact, no East Coast community, no accents at all, because it is not the same USA or world for that matter. Someone else wrote, \\"there is an explanation for that 'female wizard TV monitor screen bossy character', I thought, there should not be an explanation, we should get it, the first time. However I agreed, there is probably and explanation for everything in this film, but why bother, I do not want to dream up or think or create a book a story in my head while I watch it, if I did I would be a writer, instead I thought i would see this film for entertainment, that did not happen. There seemed to have been segments cut which left you with more questions that answers. It gets worse, the film seems to go back and forth in time so often, there is even a double or twin of one character, how did that happen?; so you need to figure that out too. You need to figure this out, that out, etc. and so on and so on. Such so it leaves your headache feel like your brain is being blown apart into \\" oblivion.\\" So at least they picked a perfect title. I am still stunned and I am ashamed to admit to anyone that I saw this movie. I think I need to keep this secret to myself. Buyer, beware. Be kind to yourself, do not see this film, or else you will regret it. One final scary thought, as I began to write this review, I saw some folks gave it high stars ratings, liking it. I cannot imagine how or why, that was scary to me. I thought this film was more bad sci fi, not at all horror. Signed... -- Not smart enough for this film.
