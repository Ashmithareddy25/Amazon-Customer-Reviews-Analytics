B00000IM2R|4.0|The record was fine, but the album cover was badly creased on one corner because it was not wrapped properly.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Open it and all the documents appear.  So refreshing.  I did not have to search for  any of my documents.  All documents opened correctly and allowed  them to be edited.
1432794426|5.0|Review of Dr.Karen Moriarty's book Defending a king-His Life & Legacy.<br /><br />This is a book that I highly recommend for any Michael Jackson fan. It is a good and positive book as defend Michael Jackson in the trial in 2005, she has used sources from Michaels 3 bodygard's, and Tom Mesereau. It is also about all the good things Michael did for charity, and how kind and loving father he was. The book is of particular parts of these last difficult years of Michael's life, and of all the accusations he has had to live with.<br />For all Michael Jackson-loving fans who want to know a little more about Michael's hard life in public, I would really like to recommend this positive book.<br />The author has written a good and positive book about the difficult life of one legend like Michael Jackson lived.<br />However I thought the book lacks some pictures .. so it would be absolutely fantastic.<br />I give 5 stars from Denmark.
B0017I91LI|5.0|The movie was well thought out to wrap it all together, nicely done. I never expected the ending to be the way it was--but I loved it.
B007TKJ4LK|2.0|it was in another language and could not get it to go to english and i was not able to enjoy it
B00C2ISGRC|4.0|No inside artworks.<br />A little Faint case-images.<br />But not expensive, good video, good sound, good story, good acting.<br />So this is not bad item.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Its a little slow at first, but the story and characters are amazing. The aliens are unique and the settings are very realistic.
B0000009RX|5.0|I first heard this record when it first came out and of course, it was kind of controversial. Frank Zappa was always an enlightened and brilliant man, and I can't think of more prophetic phrasing for today's big businesses to &#34;escape from the weight of your corporate logo!&#34;  Some wonderful melodies, pensive lyrics, and overall craziness and psychedelic experimentations are to be had within. It brought back some great memories and inspired me to &#34;unwind your mind, there is no time&#34; and be a bit more adventurously creative in my life.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game. the puzzlesnon each floor arencreative and highly addictive. the only dissappointment was when it ended. far too short
B002361MLA|5.0|Love Eckhart Tolle!  Puts just about everything in perspective. I refer to this book often as life difficulties show up.  This is a great book to help with every day living and coping with difficult people and situations.  Thanks Eckhart!

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really like the mix of characters in the movie. I used to love comic books when I was a kid and this brings me right back.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it!  I hated the ending and don't understand why the writer needed to put birth and death together twice.  Other than that I absolutely loved season three.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very interesting show that's easy to get into and not easy to get out of. Great cast of actors and I love the different cases that are explored each episode. Wonderful show and I highly recommend it for those who love a good courtroom drama series... This should be on your must watch list!
B00CK8CKP8|4.0|Gripping novel which explores the conflicts between famiiy members as the abusive father struggles to have his family adhere to the Chrisitan faith through iintimidation and abuse. An allegory for the abuse by colonial imperialism and impsitio of European ideas as superior to indigenous beliefs.
0425263924|5.0|very good book! I loved it and can't wait for the rest of the series! Thanks Sylvia Day for an exciting series!<br />(and erotic)
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Seems that every time there is an update on something, it ends up worse off.  Is it just me, or did anyone else notice that all the weather they give now is the temp. - no humidity, dew point, wind, etc.  Oh yeah, it did tell me it was raining, but I knew that.  And of course, the ads have gotten more annoying than ever - the usual reason for improving a site.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Kind of hard to use the app when there are no directions - this may take a while to learn....... And frustration!!!!
B00AR83PN4|3.0|I tend to suspect that this why there's no 3D tetris (at least as far as I know).  The game is okay, I've played it enough to develop something of a strategy that carries me for awhile at least so I'm not going to remove it yet, but if I had paid for it I can't say I would have been all that impressed.  If you could rotate the board like you can in cubistry it might help somewhat but without great speed, dexterity and X-Ray vision that really doesn't get you too far.  My best strategy so far has been to work off on end of the board, it works well enough to keep me playing long enough to make me happy.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This is perfect for a newborn, gives them something to hang onto and safe.  Wish i could find the dinosaur one though, THAT;S the one I wanted, the monkey is cute though.
B000IU3XU6|4.0|This is a typical Josh Groban album, with his mixture of classical and pop songs. The album was enjoyable and the tracks that stay in my mind particularly are In Her Eyes, February Song, You Are Loved (Don't Give Up) and probably my own personal favourite,the title track itself Awake. If I have to be critical, sometimes, he uses too much classical on this album, but overall I would recommend this album to anybody who likes 'classical pop' and if you have never heard of Josh Groban, give him a try,he has a fantastic range of notes with his voice.
0425263924|3.0|Overall the book was good! There was a lot of extra material that was thrown in the book that was not needed. It just seemed to be added to fill spaces to fill more pages. Come to find out that this trilogy is not so anymore. That after waiting so long for Gideon and Eva's story to come to a conclusion we are yet waiting again. I am giving the book a three because it should have concluded with this book. Leave out the extra fillers and get back to summing up the real story.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Friend of mine with same sense of humor recommended this, found it for a cheap price - very satisfied with purchase.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|For me this was somewhere between Lexie Graves mysteries and Calamity Jane mysteries.  I like them much better than the Calamity Jane stories.  Rose is a great chacter.  I love seeing her overcoming issues from her past and learning to come out of her shell and out from under her mother and sister.  Looking forward to more Rose Gardner stories.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|Great return to the sound that made Queensryche great! 2 songs in I had to make sure I had downloaded the right album as Todd LaTorre's voice and phrasing and delivery was identical to Tate yet he made it his own. This album feels like it should be between Rage for Order and Mindcrime given its sound. Very highly recommend this album
B004LQI0HE|2.0|I loved the cast but the movie was slow and didn't feel a great connection between all the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|Pretty good.  Writing not up to top level, but is ok & makes historical drama accessible to a wide audience & is far better written than this review, so kudos.  compelling acting & scenery to die for, makes you want to visit Scandinavia & Iceland.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Had this book in my &#34;recommended reading&#34; files for quite sometime and just never picked it back up after chapter one. I am so glad that I did! Unbelievable twists in each chapter...Amy is a mastermind!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Loved this beautiful but sad story. Cant help but get drawn to the characters, Jojo Moyes is a very talented writer.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked this book would buy more from this author .It susprised me that I liked it so much though
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was awesome! It has many twists and turns that just keep you guessing as to what is going to happen next. Loved it!!! Well worth the read :0)
B004XZR63M|5.0|I would recommend for every one.<br />We are all trapped inside the normal system of &#34;you success only if you get educated&#34;<br />This book gives a new perspective on life, not everything is easy to imply and most of it would be hard for some of us(for me!) but its get you out of the bubble of the rat race.<br />And that the most important part of starting being a rich person - and not only because of money
B0046B1KHG|5.0|You can really appreciate the subtle nuances of the movie.  There are little things like the way Gru walks and how the minions interact.  I really respected that.  The story line was entertaining and the good vs. evil will always be an attraction.  I'm looking forward to Despicable Me 2.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Perfect for mind boggling fun, keeps you attentive and makes you think in a way you haven't thought before, recommended
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I love how I can turn the screen to adjust to where I am sitting . Liked the color choices, too!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This is awesome game I just put a one star cuz I wanted to so I read o mend this game it totally worth getting it
B0041L0Z1S|4.0|I enjoyed this four part mini-series very much. It's very well done, though it's just a little predictable. I highly recommend for fans of romance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a vary fun game. That I really like it and want to play all the time. But what I hate about it is I never hit the grand prize
B0027DK206|5.0|Diana f plus back is amazing. It was easy to connect abd use. Photos come out really well. I wiuld recommend this to any one with a diana f plus

1583334386|5.0|Fast shipping and perfect book condition! It is a lot better than described. Highly recommended! Buy it, and you will never be regret.
B009O2XY12|1.0|After taking over an hour to Download found out could not play it without a Wi-Fi connection.  Go it fr the kids to play in the car for the long trip home.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|Good o protect when not in use. Prefer he folio that sands the fire up and covers every time you close it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At first I would have nothing to do with minecraft. But I figured I would see what all the minecraft stuff was about. So I paid 6.99 for it and got addicted to it it is now my favorite game. Ver. 0.7.1 alpha. Ver. 0.7.2 was released 3 days ago
1118156307|4.0|the middle part of the book is quite practical and helped me to choose methodo's for retrieving customer insights.  The other two parts are too theoretical to be usefull and not profound enough to be good material for reflection.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|the stooges were one of Detroit bands that came out and rock the town with a great sound and beat no fun and 1969 are great
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's great that you still earn money even when your not playing.  SimCity like with out all of the utilities. It passes the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses I always have and she  I can't ride my horse buddy because of the weather I play with my virtual horse
B00008OWZC|5.0|I still cannot believe the amazing sound on this CD given it was recorded so many years ago.  The song selection is very good and although there are a few embarrassing moments, 95% of it is awesome!  You can skip Bonham's 20-minute drum solo (sounds like my 4 year old son in the kitchen) and parts of Dazed and Confused are a little boring - but the rest rocks!  Highly recommended!
B000BT97AO|3.0|My mistake, when approaching this film, was to expect it to make sense.  That's not to say that I didn't \\"get\\" it--the parallels between the dream world and Helena's own life were clear, sometimes blindingly or painfully so. In fact, the sequence of actions that formed the plot only makes sense if seen as a series of vignettes in which some aspect of Helena's inner struggle is given tangible form, for her to confront and overcome.<br /><br />We have seen this sort of journey before.  The most direct parallel is, of course, Labyrinth.  The entire cast, from the young female protagonist to the companion-traitor-savior figure, the dark-but-compelling parental figure and the cast of misfit allies and antagonists, are all in place.<br /><br />What Labyrinth had that MirrorMask lacked, however, is an internal logic that made the protagonist's journey a story, and not just a random series of abstract events.  The dream-like quality in MirrorMask was dialed up so high that at no point could I truly suspend disbelief and accept that journey as real.  Things happened when they did because the script said so, and not because the momentum or trajectory of the story had led us there.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was with the ending, in which everything was wrapped up too neatly, too quickly.  All along, we had been treated to images of what Helena's dark half had been doing with her life.  These were apparently taken away without consequence when Helena returned.  I had been interpreting the film as two sides of Helena's personality at war under the stress and grief of her mother's illness, and the dark side only her \\"acting out\\" at this war of emotions.  The Helena in the dream, the \\"true\\" person, was trying to find herself and beat back the darkness before the mask that she wore claimed her completely.<br /><br />Except, that wasn't it at all.  We are treated to a picture perfect ending, in which there were no consequences.  I'm perfectly fine with happy endings, but only when they are earned, and this one did not seem to be.<br /><br />And so, I come to the crux of the review.  I came to the film expecting it to make sense, expecting an ending which followed from that which came before it, and I was disappointed.  If I ever watch the film again, it will be to appreciate it in a different way--as an abstract representation of inner turmoil, scenes from a character's journey and not the journey itself, with visuals designed to indicate, rather than represent, the action taking place.<br /><br />Recommendation:  Accept it for what it is, and you'll enjoy it much more.
B000002J09|5.0|What can you say that hasn't already been said - the songs, the sound -- amazing.  So many classics.  The only semi-weak song is Evermore but even that is very good.  This album rocks!!  Song by song ratings:<br />1. Black Dog - 5<br />2. Rock And Roll - 5<br />3. The Battle Of Evermore - 4.5<br />4. Stairway To Heaven - 5<br />5. Misty Mountain Hop - 5<br />6. Four Sticks - 5<br />7. Going To California - 5<br />8. When The Levee Breaks - 5<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I missed Season 1 and 2 but not now! Now I can catch up and be ready for Season 3 which is coming soon.
B000002J1U|5.0|Definitely one of the most under rated albums in rock history.  If this was released by any other band it would be considered a classic - but because LZ had raised the bar so high this was considered a disappointment upon release.  One of my favorites and highly recommended!  Song-by-song ratings:<br />1. Immigrant Song - 5<br />2. Friends - 4.5<br />3. Celebration Day - 4.5<br />4. Since I've Been Loving You - 5<br />5. Out On The Tiles - 4<br />6. Gallows Pole - 5<br />7. Tangerine - 5<br />8. That's The Way - 5<br />9. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp - 5<br />10. Hats Off To (Roy) Harper - 4
B003PIUC02|5.0|Season one started it all! Although the main actor changed after season one (RIP Andy Whitfield), none of the action and drama changed, if not, got better. Andy and the cast's acting and action got many people, including myself, hooked on Spartacus.
1781162646|5.0|Excellent book with an interesting theme.  Read it out loud to hubby while moving from Oregon to Texas last week and we both enjoyed it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Full of adventure and continuing of the story of the secret human weapons introduced in the &#34;Bourne Series.&#34; The story continues!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I have played this game on the computer before and loved it, I am glad I was able to get a tablet version and can play it all the time now. Thank You
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book was a total waste of my time. Very weak story line. The only reason I finished the book was because I kept thinking the story had to lead somewhere. Boy, was I wrong, no drama, no excitement, stupid sex situations, just boring.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|When I saw the trailer the only thing that came to my mind was, \\"This is exactly like Set it Off\\". Except it has all white guys in it. My cousins took me to see the movie and I have to say it was great, better than I expected. It ended exactly like how Set it Off did but still, it was a good movie
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I became totally addicted to this game. I've had to set up four different players so that I. could start over again.

B002YCVX5S|5.0|i enjoyed the plot and the actors. it was a believable story. U can tell its a Quentin Tarantino film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was great. After the war, DA gets down to drama in the house with situations that are real for this time period. I was sad to see some cast go and it will be interesting to see where the story goes in the next season. Can't wait.
0307277453|4.0|This book was well written and informative.  Definitely a fun read and one that I've recommended to other friends and family members.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|Great movie for a family movie night! Especially for little basketball fans. All ages will love this movie! It's really cute.
8866130923|5.0|These are my favorite planners.  With the notes pages and plenty of room to write in a busy schedule, I've been using them for years.  The cover is durable and the paper is nice and heavy, but a perfect size to throw in my slightly oversized purse.

B001IF252C|5.0|I just bought one of these adapters, and it came with firmware 1.03.<br /><br />I was getting snow just about out of the box, I also had the display go dark on me a few times for no reason, general weirdness. Unusable with my 27\\" iMac and monoprice 27\\" display.<br /><br />The secret sauce - plug the USB cable on the adapter into a cell phone or ipod charger. The USB only carries power, no data. If you're having issues, it's most likely an issue of the computer's USB not pushing enough power to keep the adapter happy.<br /><br />Hope that helps.
006056251X|4.0|Sebastian is fiendishly wonderful. He's a gentleman in name only. He's a masculine powerhouse of ferocity and desire. He leaps into his new role swinging his fists and ravishing his new wife. When it comes to Evie he's raw and uncivilized and desires her desperately. He's so hotly devilish. This book was fun, sexy and passionate.
0811833887|5.0|i want this book forever. The movie is amazing and the art and design are so creative. good art book
0525478817|4.0|I'm shredded and heartbroken. I realize this was inevitable. The story is triumphant and so very sad. Hazel and Gus together is the silver lining. Their love story is innocent and beautiful and ancient all at once. Gus is such utter sunshine. I loved his character. Hazel is sharp and wise. She is a beauty lacking vanity and when she allows herself to live and love- her strength and own light shines brightly.<br />Green's writing is incredibly approachable and so very good. This book feels important and necessary to experience-even when faced with the pain and tears it evokes. I initially put it down because I was crying, so early, too early already I thought. But I'm so glad I had the courage to pick it up again.
1452111014|5.0|I just love the movie and concept. It has so many different art style in one book. so good good

B00571F26Y|5.0|All I can say is...this book totally changed how I see the (food) world.  I've been studying ketosis, gluten allergies and sugar abuse in America for a bit now and this book pulled it al together for me.  Be aware: This is a highly bias toward his beliefs book.  This is not a balanced point of view perspective.  It's a attack on wheat, sugar, the Governments food pyramid and the American food industry.  He backs it up with substantial analysis of several studies and his own observations as a physician.

B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|There's no question that \\"Yeezus\\" isn't the Kanye album anyone expected.  Given that Kanye was becoming a first-time father about the time the album came out, and the origin story of the album involved a lot of time in Paris staring at lamps, \\"Yeezus\\" wasn't expected to be so...angry.<br /><br />Yet, even though I considered myself a pretty casual Kanye fan in the past (the divisive \\"808's and Heartbreak\\" was my favorite Kanye album before this one), I really think he's made an interesting album here that I can't stop listening to.  How many new albums in ANY genre can you honestly say that about.<br /><br />Which is why the aggregate 3-star rating on Amazon baffles me.  If you just Kanye to begin with, you probably should be buying his album, let alone throwing a 1* review at it.  If you're a Kanye fan that liked the poppier stuff and sped up gospel hooks, I don't think those things are dead - they're just being put to the side a bit.<br /><br />I have no idea how Kanye intended this music or his lyrics to be interpreted.  But it's pretty clear to me that \\"Yeezus\\" is a musical persona, not actually Kanye himself.  The anger, aggression, masculinity, and pure \\"id\\" in the lyrics is Kanye lashing out - both honestly and satirically - about the life of a mega-celebrity consumed by always wanting \\"more\\".<br /><br />But probably my favorite thing about \\"Yeezus\\" is how much CONTENT it has for being around 40-minutes.  Not that I hated all the skits and \\"throwaway\\" tracks on \\"The College Dropout\\", but it's refreshing once in awhile to have an album get to the point and stay on that point for 9 straight tracks...followed by \\"Bound 2\\", which is more of a classic Kanye song.  I understand the hate, but it's way overblown.
1475972350|1.0|I solved the twist as well as the killers profession by chapter 4. I thought I could get past the extremely amateur writing, amateur dialogue, & over use of exclamation marks but when I realized I'd solved the book by chapter 4 it became a serious drain to continue reading. The overall writing of this book was as though it was written by someone in 6th-8th grade. Then to make the main woman character a lesbian?? It just seemed like an immature little boy wrote this. Why did she have to be a lesbian? Can strong, smart women characters not exist unless they are gay? It added absolutely nothing to the story line, there was no build up, there was no passion behind the scene, it was completely worthless. The character building was non existent, the big scenes were incredibly lack luster. Over all this book was exactly as it is titled, a \\"Time Killer\\". I would read another one in hopes that the level of writing goes up as this author grows, matures, & works out the kinks in his writing over time. But I will say this, if the next one is both this predictable & this poorly written, I will never read another one again.
1401324649|5.0|My husband bought this book for a friend who is Swedish and he was delighted to receive it.  Of course he had to read it beforehand.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|To be honest i liked the book and the movie was good but it had its flaws, my first issue and my main issue was that everything was to  unrealistic and im not talking about the zombies, after the lead scientist dies garry suddenly becomes a pro scientist and gets unbelievably lucky. this made the movie extremely predictable and it sucked some of the fun out of it. the acting was good so that wasnt a problem but the problem is just the movies completely predictable, other than that it was a good movie, in my personal opinion see it in the theater or rent it, if its on sale then its worth it. So id give it a<br />4/5 for action<br />2/5 for originality<br />4/5 for acting<br />and 4/5 for story.<br />so overall i would definetly have to give this movie a 4/5

B00B5AP7NY|5.0|What an awesome little movie this was!  I wasn't even aware it existed until I stumbled upon it one day.  The LEGO animated characters and \\"playsets\\" are beautifully done, and the storyline is very entertaining, for both adults and children.  DC Comics may not do live action movies that well, but they put out some fantastic animated ones.<br /><br />This movie brings some \\"fun\\" back into the DC Universe.  It reminds me of being a kid again. Fans of the original Super Friends cartoon series (and its many incarnations) will really enjoy this LEGO Batman movie.  Batman is serious and Robin is kid-like and sometimes clumsy.  Superman rushes in to save the day occasionally.  When he does, Robin is in awe; Batman less than thrilled that Superman is stealing his thunder.  Classic!  Although I wish there were even more DC characters that made appearances, we do get to see some of the main Justice Leaguers and numerous Batman villains (plus Lex Luthor).<br /><br />Give me LEGO DC superhero movies any day over any current animated superhero shows.
0062124293|1.0|Glad I continued reading past p 100, otherwise my verdict would have been \\"straight for the bin\\", \\"a waste of time\\" or, as one critic on Amazon.com has it: \\"Why does feministic honesty have to be so base? Why can't honest feminism also be eloquent and dignified?\\". The book is, at times, funny, but I am happy to say that I have done so many things in my life differently. The title is also quite misleading. \\"How to Be Human\\" would serve both the contents and the author's purpose of writing better. The writer provides some insight into feminism today, and there are some well-made points, but it is also easy to find flaws. Is the reason people don't want to label themselves \\"feminists\\" simply because they take the word to mean 'man-hater'? I don't think so.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I loved this book  - the twists and turns. And it's so close to the truth.<br /><br /> Barbara Lauman  \\"Conversations with my daughter on the other side\\"
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|I have been watching suits since the pilot aired on USA. I fell in love with this series and have since gotten many people just as hooked. Cant go wrong with this witty, fast paced, comedic drama. It will keeping you laughing and thinking
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The evolvement of each character as they face their individual and connected challenges is both engaging,<br />and well thought out.  Enjoyable reading and I am looking forward to the next book.
0553582038|2.0|Too long and full of unnecessary details and characters that does not necessarily advance plot. Reader almost needs a reference card with names of characters to keep up.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed the nice graphics and fun game play. The puzzles were challenging enough but not impossible.  The game is very atmospheric with spooky music and sound effects.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was great because all the details and the emotion you get when you read it it feels like the book is alive. It is the best book I have ever read and most awesome.
B00932A4XE|2.0|The females at the start of the film were so annoying, and the script was so trite and predictable, I turned this off. I suppose I'm not really the audience the film makers wanted (62 year-old grandma) ... but I was just looking for a pleasant diversion on a scorchingly hot summer's day while I relaxed in the AC ... something along the lines of &#34;He's Just Not That Into You.&#34; This was not it. Even Carmen Diaz (who I usually like) got on my nerves. Thank goodness this was an Amazon Prime freebie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome I like how its not repetitive and challenges the brain. you should get it now. all of the levels are different
B0026KX5PO|5.0|It's a good story, beautifully shot, with interesting characters and a scheme convoluted enough to keep you wondering &#34;How is he going to get away with that?&#34;  OK, there may be holes in the plot, especially as Ripley's elaborate ruse unravels, and the pace may be slow... but, hey, watching Jude Law and Matt Damon (and Phillip Seymoir Hoffman) with Italy as a backdrop, that's what I like.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What more can I say but I am hooked on the characters and I would like for the 4th season to start immediately.  It is almost like being involved with the royals and having an inside view of their lives.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. The plot was rich and the story was full of quirky characters .
B000001EYW|5.0|I LOVE AMAZON, & THE TRANSACTION WAS PERFECT!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE. I LOVE THIS CD!! EVERY SONG IS AWSOME!! I LOVE THE BEE GEES!!! TO ME, THEY WILL ALWAYS BE THE #1 SINGER, SONGWRITER, PRODUCERS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE THE LARGEST SONG PORTFOLIO, IT'S IN THE THOUSANDS. BARRY GIBB IS A GENIOUSE, HE IS & WILL ALWAYS BE THE MOST TALENTED OF THEM ALL. I LOVE EACH & EVERY ONE OF THEM, SO SAD TO LOSE SUCH SWEET & WONDERFULLY TALENTED ARTISTS. SOME MAY NOT KNOW, THAT BARRY IS IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS, BEING THE SECOND MOST SUCCESSFUL SONGWRITER IN HISTORY, THE FIRST, BEING PAUL MCCARTNEY. ROBIN'S DEATH WAS A GREAT LOSS FOR ME!! THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER VIBRATO VOICE LIKE HIS. THEY WROTE, SANG, & PRODUCED OVER 30 + ALBUMS(NOT MENTIONING THE ALBUMS THEY WROTE, & PRODUCED FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN MUSIC). THEY All DID SOME SOLO WORK, & I HAVE ALMOST EVERY BEE GEE ALBUM , INCLUDING BARRY'S MUSIC & THE DEMOS FOR THE OTHER ARTISTS HE WROTE  & PRODUCED FOR. I LOVE EVERY ALBUM, THEY EVER WROTE. THEY REINVENTED THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT 4 GENERATIONS AT LEAST. ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS ,HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALITY,& SOUND. LIKE A PERSON. I HAVE A FEW I DONT OWN YET!! I LISTEN TO THEM EVERY DAY. I'LL BE WAITING FOR BARRY TO COME OUT WITH HIS OWN ALBUM, HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW, HE WANTED TO MAKE A COUNTRY ALBUM. HE COULD SING A COMMERCIAL, IN A PAPER BAG, AND HE WOULD SOUND INCREDIBLE. I WILL BUY ANYTHING HE PUTS OUT, MY 6 YR OLD DAUGHTER FEELS THE SAME WAY.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|First, the app itself is great. I can use my phone or tablet to scan and email documents. On a business trip and need to document your expenses? Just whip out your phone and you've got an easily organized electronic copy of your receipt you can compile into a multi-page PDF. Need to sign and return a document? Done! It offers image enhancement so the resulting image has dark black text against a clean, white background. Scans are very easy to read. Easily would be a five star app and well worth the purchase price.<br />Now for the downside: if you reset your phone, you lose all your scans! For an application of this nature, you would  expect it to store the scans in a readable format on the internal/external SD card (not wiped by a factory reset), but it doesn't. When you open up the app after reinstalling it, all your scans are gone! Grizzly Labs, fix this flaw and that last star will appear!
B000I186FW|5.0|Awesomely interesting. Beautiful. Stunning. Action packed. Suspenseful. Full of funny scenes and its just overwhelmingly good. I could watch this over and over and over and still love it
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie;  it's used, but it's exactly like a new one.  The price was really good for this item.  Couldn't find it anywhere else in this condition for such a good price!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Got the game for free on one of Amazon's Daily deals and absolutely enjoyed it.  Even my 7 year-old enjoyed the game and played it multiple times.  The game is one where you must use clues (or get lucky) to find pieces to solve puzzles to move to different areas of the game.  Once you open up each area of the game then you solve the main game.  Its entertaining and quite fun.  The game can be solved in a few hours or it can take you a day or two depending on how long you stick with it in one sitting.  Good replay value.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is easy to learn but challenging enough to keep you coming back.<br />The vehicle mechanics take some gettinng use too.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Not as good as other puzzles of its kind but I did play it to the end.  It was interesting at first but I grew bored as it became confusing on how to move through each phase.  I hit a dead end a few times and had to use the hint feature to move along.  It passed the time (at an airport no less).  It didn't have any replay value for me once I finished it.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I love this microphone. Good balance, great pick up. Perfect for vocals. I'm going to buy another one. It's a great buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a really fun game with good graphics! The horse movement is pretty realistic which made me happy so yay horses
B004QK5N5W|3.0|The product quality is fine, however with wifi technology on most TVs these days, this adapter does not make sense anymore.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I give this book high rating because it never felt like a typical zombie story. It went around the world with many very different views from the \\"survivors\\". Very descriptive and easy to get into.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even though this novel is about adolescents suffering or recovering from cancer, it is also a beautiful love story.  I fell in love with the characters.  Couldn't put it down.
B0000CFW87|5.0|He is one of my favorite singers of all time.  His music never disappoints me, he puts his all into  his music..
B000AOEMXM|4.0|It's okay, but a couple of the DVDs have a problem playing on my DVD recorder. I don't know though, it could be my recorder, but the others play fine...
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its ok. not too bad. I like games like this. a little hard to navigate rooms sometimes . other than that its good
0062197266|5.0|Fantastic book, maybe the best I've read in five years. Completely well-written, engaging way that the author bounces back and forth in time and builds up the suspense for the events happening in the current time. Romantic, sexy, engaging, and totally terrifying thriller. Definitely read this one, immediately!!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|He pours out his soul while playing guitar and singing. You don't see that in many artist these days. He's the real deal.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I did a lot of comparison between many different ones. Found exactly what I was looking for at a great price. I would recommend this product to others.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I did a lot of comparison between many different ones. Found exactly what I was looking for at a great price. I would recommend this product to others.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Great picture quality and sound.  Doesn't seems to be a second hand production from China, seems excellent.  If you are new to game of thrones, be cautious if you dont like rated R content.  This has very strong language and nudity.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I did a lot of comparison between many different ones. Found exactly what I was looking for at a great price. I would recommend this product to others.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Picture quality is excellent as are the bonus features, dital copy, and even a dvd copy if you dont have blueray.  I recommend the blue-ray though the production is excellent.  If you are new to game of thrones, buy cautiously if you dont like R rated content.  The content is very strong with langue and nudity.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|This is a great read for aspiring writers!  I appreciated King's abrupt honesty as he shared his views on capturing life experiences and getting them down on paper.  There is no secret formula, yet King provides some sound advice.
B002RI9M2U|4.0|I´m not used to reading these type of genere but I´m glad I did. It wasn´t a happy story but it has its own &#34;feel good&#34; inside these troubled characters.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|Did Robert Wagner ever really look this young? LOL, fun family style movie to watch, good entertainment without the modern gore value movie directors think is necessary in today's movies.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|Great book. Riveting. I couldn't put it down. If you didn't believe in extraterrestrials before, you will after reading the Day After Roswell. The findings launched us into the computer age, laser beams, Kevlar, heat seeking missles, superior night-vision technology and more. Author is a colonel from WWII and Korea who worked with a number of Presidents and was head of Research and Development at the Pentagon. If you can't believe him, who can you believe. Discover how they covered it up and about the separate mini government that was created and has unbelievable power. Amazing read!
B000VSAEYI|3.0|While the actual play pool looked like a great toy for young kids, the quality was called into question after the pool started to deflate after an hour of use despite careful handling....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good game.  Can`t wait until the update, very challenging.  Last level available was very hard to me.  This game is like a puzzle and makes you think.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I've recommended this book (all three, actually) to my family and friends. We've had great conversations about these books. We loved them.
B00BXHE0CI|4.0|Music reviewers may rely on categorization too often. My first instinct was to agree with the folks who categorize The Dillinger Escape Plan (DEP) as mathcore which has hardcore punk/heavy mental instrumentation combined with frenetic, changing time signatures beyond the realm of your \\"average\\" progressive metal. To me, mathcore could be the free-jazz of heavy metal. Even if I don't totally understand it, I can totally appreciate it.<br /><br />I have experienced some prior DEP recordings and read some existing reviews. I could take a review of their previous CD Option Paralysis, change the title to 2013's One Of Us Is The Killer, swap out song titles and VIOLA the reviews would read the same. The amazing thing is that the formula isn't broken so there's no need to fix it. Lead guitarist and only original-member Ben Weinman still crafts chaos inside concise metal statements. Greg Puciato's vocals are very high energy (understatement); his delivery is insanity on purpose yet when he sings melody he has a very Mike Patton-esque feel which is a compliment, yet a simple comparison however apt. Drumming on this release is Billy Rymer whose performance provides structure to the chaos while contributing to it as well. Liam Wilson slings the bass and part of his charm is his on-stage presence; search for the Golden Gods 2013 performance of DEP to witness his command. Rhythm guitarist Lames Love is a solid piece in the atonal puzzle.<br /><br />One factor that sticks out is the effective use of melodic background vocals, specifically on tracks \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" and \\"Nothing's Funny,\\" the latter of which would make an excellent single as it has more accessible qualities than the bulk of the CD.<br /><br />\\"Understanding Decay\\" features melodic vocals during chorus with drawn out phrasing over frenetic instrumentation. This formula works as a way to include some type of hook into the hardcore chaos. After repeated listens I can happily advise that there is no lack ofhooks. At the same time there is still plenty of aggressive, angry-sounding explosiveness featured on the first single \\"When I Lost My Bet.\\"<br /><br />Another serious FNM-ism appears on \\"Paranoia Shields.\\" DEP and the rock music community may tire of the continual comparisons between themselves and Faith No More but it is hard to ignore the many similarities. I don't find this to be troubling, however, as the music world has been missing a high-profile group able to so deftly combine multiple dynamics with memorable choruses.<br /><br />Instrumental \\"CH 375 268 277 ARS\\" proves math rock test has been passed and provides a quasi-intro into \\"Magic That I Held You Prisoner.\\"<br /><br />The energy on this release is infectious. There is no question that DEP accomplished exactly what they set out to do.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|My son just loves this movie and for it to be on amazon prime is awesome.  My son wants to watch it everyday.  I recommend this to everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game a bit harder than most games I play on the kindle but I couldn't put it down.  Highly entertaining!!!  Graphics were awesome.  $1.99 doesn't do it justice!
B000002J1O|5.0|THANK YOU!!!!  I AM A LONG TIME GENESIS FAN. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THIER CD'S I WAS MISSING. CD IS IN PERFECT CONDITION.
B004QX07G4|3.0|When I purchased this book I thought it would b laugh out loud funny.  It wasn't. Ellen may have gotten a book deal or had a time limit to finish, but I still think she is more hilarious on tv than in this book. Ok, seriously I was disappointed.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|This is a very nice watch however I received mine with a dead battery. I ordered a replacement which was dead as well. The price and quality will justify (for me) the expense and effort to have the battery replaced.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is so addicting i love how theres so many options its great and the controls really good would recomend for all ages so great
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I've never been disappointed in MIchael Buble.  Great selection of songs and the music is excellent. If you like Buble, you will like this CD.Enjoying very much.

B0014DQSG2|5.0|Good, light-hearted family movie. A young American girl finds her father in England, but he doesn't know he had any children. As they get to know each other, his fiancé tried to interfere. At the end the father and daughter become closer than ever and go to America to live as a family with her mother.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|i like this its not addicting though and i was sort of dissapionted i like brave better i like it okay though
B006PTL1QM|5.0|The story is Historic and seems to be very realistic with a bit of Hollywood added to the analyzing.  I love stories about the time and events of WWII and this did not disappoint at all. Excellent account. Christine C
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome game I play his every time I come home from school this is the most awareness and awesome game I have ever played in my life&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
1469203820|5.0|Audio is surprisingly good, for a one voice actor nick podehl does an impressive job and gets all of the emotion down in his voice. Great audio recording of my favorite book!
B000002I6X|5.0|Great album that remains timeless! Better than his first solo work staying strong in lyrics and music brings back good memories.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This is going down on my all time favorites list. Reading this book is an exhilarating, emotional experience. It touches on themes of memory, identity, loss and above all Animal Rights. It is not preachy or mawkish, though in less capable hands the subject could be. There is a great vein of humor and even suspense running through this incredible story of Rosemary and her siblings. I cannot recommend this highly enough. A truly unforgettable read
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game is a good reasoning game. Tests memory too. Looking forward to playing more. Great way to play with kids. Sometimes very frustrating.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This film shows the misery of life in a WWII submarine.  What was seen as the life of war heroes by their German countrymen, was a terrible profession for those who prayed on merchantmen, in the least honorable way.  The technical aspects are almost perfect, the way on life onboard is impeccable.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game, however, somethings are just entirely too hard to collect.  And I Wish you could have in game friends not just facebook friends.
B0053O89XI|3.0|I expected full HD and Latin Spanish audio. None of them. Just HD and Castillian Spanish audio. That's why give it three stars. Besides being my favorite TV show.
145211207X|5.0|This is a great book to really see how the movie came together. When you look at the drawings and see where the developers started with the characters and how the characters evolved.
B007SXB498|5.0|S sharia teeth dug great rip uhh urn ggh teeth shed ugh Irish did they ggh hugged they uhh cnn uhh
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is one of the few TV shows that I feel warrants collecting the series.  Decent plots, good CGI, and great-looking &#34;heroes&#34;.<br />I will be waiting for season 8 to complete the collection.  Sorry to see this show end.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|He likes the animation and the cars, and the cute little things involving 'Mater, and I liked the jokes and story.  A win for the family!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The plot is well thought out and, for the most art, well executed. Unfortunately, the last book is the weakest link in the trilogy. I came to care for the characters and thought the epilogue kind of made up for the less than super story overall in the third book and would recommend this to readers of any age. It's less of a teen-romance-drama story than say &#34;Twilight&#34; and others like it. More depth, more tragegy, less sappy love triangle.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|He loves animated movies with rats apparently, and I love the sweet and engaging story, non-traditional characters, and nice visuals.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is a really fun game for all ages and really keeps you engaged. the only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was the pop up ads. they are very annoying!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This version is not as user friendly as the old version. The old app was so much better. More colorful, covered the full screen, much easier to use. Why change a good thing?
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I like the cooking books with all the recipes in it there is some nice ones to make in there
B009FZHYKU|5.0|They just keep getting better each season Loved this new season well worth the money Cant wait until new season starts.
193700788X|5.0|Miss Harris never disappoints me. The book was everything I wanted it to be.I think it tied up the series nicely.
B000002LCB|5.0|I ended up loving the Music in the movie so I got the Soundtrack for it so I can hear the Songs I enjoy from the movie
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|So far this game is so superior to all the others I've played. Excellent in realism and the graphics is are terrific. Thumbs up for this game I hope they're making another one with Raptors.  Great fun to play.
B000SEJHRA|1.0|I just don't get it.  I thought I would try Sedaris' humor based on previous reviews and the fact that I like dry humor.  This did not cut it for me at all.  The &#34;rooster&#34; passage that previous reviewers lauded as a classic Sedaris work of art was only mildly amusing.  My suggestion to other readers who are not fans of Sedaris is to try a few pages from the look inside feature - if you are not roaring out loud, skip the book, because the stories don't get any better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I can see the numbers.  Great for use at the grocery store and while at the mall shopping. Very handy.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|It was Bruce Willis in an action packed drama. It will have you cheering and even comes with a few plot twisters.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|best game ever with so many updates and Multi player I am so excited to try that part out thanks glue!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|When planning any trips/vacations, I always check Trip Advisor for the reviews.  I know they are from real people and are reliable!!
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|See you can have it all with a kindle. Not only movies, tv shows, music, games, books, but you can go to the  web, go tp Favebook, and even get your gmail. I love it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved the details and the fact that it wasn't crazy challenging. I wish the game was a little longer but it is a great tease for the next chapter, which I am keeping a lookout for! I recommend this game to anyone.
0756404746|5.0|This is a great coming of age story.  More like literature than typical fantasy book.  One of my top 5 favorite books.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Enjoyed watching this movie.  I like movies that based on a true event.  Go ahead and rent it, you will enjoy it!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game is a little hard to understand at first but it gets better. It's a time killer and is fairly fun.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It would be nice if there was more to  the instructions and when playing, a hint or two would be helpful
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super fun and challenging game that will keep you wanting to play more. wish there were more levels. I thought it was fun.
B0050LJIRK|3.0|In 2005, Floridian nu/rap metal pioneers Limp Bizkit finally got serious by releasing \\"The Unquestionable Truth, Part 1\\" Six years later, after original guitarist/founding member Wes Borland left and rejoined the band a nearly unquantifiable number of times, L.B. finally returned with a follow-up to that E.P. in 2011's \\"Gold Cobra.\\" Unfortunately, this record does not pick up where \\"Unquestionable\\" left off. No, it actually plays more like a continuation of the band's 1997 debut, \\"3 Dollar Bill, Ya'll\\" than anything else.<br /><br />As with almost any Limp Bizkit release, \\"Gold Cobra\\" does have some impressive instrumental work, including abrasive guitar crunch (even if none these riffs are as memorable as the ones heard on previous Bizkit classics like \\"Nookie\\" and \\"Breakstuff\\"), clever, dexterous bass lines, and jazzy drum beats. But it is almost all for not, as the album is dragged down by frontman Fred Durst, who delivers a thoroughly uneven performance from behind the mic. At his best, Durst's vocals and lyrics are very catchy, and even memorable. But at his worst, Durst is just flat-out unlistenable. Take, for example, the lyrics to track six, \\"Shotgun,\\" where Durst spouts lines like \\"Everybody jumps at the sound of a shotgun/In my neighborhood, everybody's got one!\\" There are so many things wrong to this lyric, that it's hard to know where to begin. For starters, if everybody in his neighborhood owns said gun, then why would ANYbody be startled when they heard one being fired? (And plus, Durst reportedly has a net-worth of more than eight-million dollars, so even trying to picture him living in ghetto with a gun is positively laughable!)<br /><br />The record begins in strong-enough fashion, but seems to taper off a bit the more it plays (and suffer from a sort of late-disc fatigue). Indeed, following \\"Introbra,\\" a skippable little intro track, comes \\"Bring It Back,\\" which finds Borland laying down a dissonant, grungy-sounding main riff to provide the musical backdrop to a bunch of Fred's most ham-fisted rapping, thus making this number come across sounding like a piece of full-on gangster rap. Indeed, Durst puffs his chest relentlessly throughout this song, with a typical wall-of-yuck and whatever rhymes, but the track is saved from becoming a total disaster thanks to its inclusion of some really catchy choruses. (Here, Wes provides \\"Bring It Back\\" with hip-hop-derived guitar sound effects, and four-stringer Sam Rivers plays some heavily funk-inflected bass lines.) Later tracks, such as \\"Dbag,\\" are similar in that they have great, throbbing, pulsating bass lines and noteworthy turntable work snaking throughout. And these two things, coupled together with another abrasively crunchy guitar lick, try to save \\"Dbag\\" from its lyrically awful pitfall, but cannot quite do so fully successfully.<br /><br />Another noteworthy track is the above-mentioned/described \\"Shotgun.\\" It is the album's lead single, and deservedly so, too, as it is a very contagious and addictively catchy number. And it is laced with deftly nimble, slapped bass lines, good DJ work, and (in the case of the song's choruses, which are clearly designed to get the mosh pit swirling as hard as possible) very heavy, crunchy, chunky, head-bangable guitar riffs. And these choruses are then followed-up by a guitar solo (I know: *gasp!). True, the solo is a fairly short and very simplistic one, but it is a not-un-ripping guitar solo nonetheless, and the first one that Limp Bizkit has ever recorded! And for another example of tragically annoying lyrics dragging down an otherwise decent song, check out the Nirvana-meets-Cypress Hill-esque approach taken on \\"Get A Life,\\" which has brutal, slamdanceable choruses, and swift sing-speak vocals. But Fred's rapping here, no matter how fluid as it may be, is again dragged down by terribly annoying and clich&eacute; chest-pumping lyricism. (Its subject matter deals with Fred living the high-life, and other un-relatable topicssimilar to that.)<br /><br />Of the rest of the album that remains, about half of it is decent/workable. The title track boasts a pounding, throbbing bass groove and Tom Morello-styled guitars-used-as-synthesizers-esque sound effects. And later, \\"Walking Away,\\" an acoustic ballad, is also strictly decent, as is the bass-driven \\"Autotunage\\" (a track that boasts a good bass intro, and impressive, propulsive bass fills snaking throughout), and \\"Why Try,\\" which is features some irresistibly catchy vocal hooks. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, only half of the remaining material is decent, meaning that the other half is pretty darned bad. The \\"Breakstuff\\" sequel, \\"Shark Attack,\\" despite boasting some abrasive guitar crunch and strong, grumbling bass lines, ultimately comes across sounding like a caricature of itself, and so does \\"Loser,\\" which begins with a nice melodic intro before being overcome by Eminem-esque angry white-boy rapping. And two other low-points include \\"90.2.10,\\" which, despite having a strong delivery, is bogged down by far-too-many Nirvana basics/clich&eacute;s; and the just plain grating album closer, \\"Killer In You.\\"<br /><br />As was the case with \\"3 Dollar Bill, Ya'll,\\" \\"Significant Other,\\" and \\"Chocolate Starfish,\\" \\"Gold Cobra\\" can be thought of one of two ways: a) as a catchy and hard-rocking piece of raw nu/rap metal; or b) as a piece of white-boy posturing, money-grubbing garbage. The secret to it is to not over-think it, because when you do, your reaction to this album will most certainly be the latter. But if you just sort of sit back and let the music flow over you, it will turn into a fairly decent and very enjoyable listen. With that said, though, it is true that \\"Gold Cobra\\" is a significant step backwards for the band from their promising 2005 E.P., the aforementioned \\"Unquestionable Truth.\\"r to that.)<br /><br />Of the rest of the album that remains, about half of it is decent/workable. The title track boasts a pounding, throbbing bass groove and Tom Morello-styled guitars-used-as-synthesizers-esque sound effects. And later, \\"Walking Away,\\" an acoustic ballad, is also strictly decent, as is the bass-driven \\"Autotunage\\" (a track that boasts a good bass intro, and impressive, propulsive bass fills snaking throughout), and \\"Why Try,\\" which is features some irresistibly catchy vocal hooks.

B007MDB71O|5.0|Long time waited and dreamed - at last it´s real! True film of a century! I really hope that they´ll make the sequel some day!
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Very good. Leads you to give a hard look to the importance of being in the right position to really offer a good service. That place is giving priority to give yourself the attention you deserve. Then you are really ready to give to your clients what they also deserve.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have not actually viewed my movie.  I saw this version at a theater and when I saw it for sale on Amazon, knew that I wanted to own it.  Les Miserables has always been my favorite book.  I saw the touring stage version twice several years back.  When the movie came out, I knew it was a must see even though I was worried that it wouldn't compare to the book or stage play.  It did.....and I recommend the movie to everyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVED THE SERIES AND CANNOT WAIT TILL BOOK #4 COMES OUT.  GREAT SERIES TO READ AND ENJOY , FOR SURE!
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|While diving air bubbles would get trapped between the filter and the lens. This was easily remedied by popping the filter off and snapping it back on. It was pretty easy to do that under water. It was very effective at making the video and pictures less &#34;blue.&#34; While drying everything back in the room I dropped the case on the tile floor. The filter broke, so be careful.
B007V80WUC|5.0|This album from Circus Maximus is a must have album. Every once in awhile you get an album that you just can stop listening to, Nine is one of those albums.<br /><br />Everything about this album is great, the songs are perfectly crafted progressive metal. Each song offers its own melodic blend with enough experimental content to be unique and at the same time maintaining great song writing. The production is sweet to the ears, each instrument offers top notch musicianship., and the vocals are nothing less than amazing.  The songs have really catchy hooks that offer that perfect blend of heavy and catchy grooves.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, some of the music has this really slight influence of bands like Yes and Zebra all the while maintaining modern progressive metal.<br /><br />Stop reading and purchase it already.<br /><br />Personally I can't wait for more follow up albums. Circus Maximus has definitely become one of my favorite bands, along the likes of Pagan's Mind, Dream Theater, Rush, etc.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's okay but sometimes it freezes and the Pearson goes really slowly if they could fix this then it would be the best app!!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|We watch this series and glad to have opportunity to see a missed episode.  Husband likes it more tha I do,  Interesting characters.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Thanks for the quick arrival of this DVD. I had to replace this, since I was'nt paying attention to my granddaughter and she got hold of it and scratched it up!!!!!!
1781162646|5.0|Following closely on the heels of one of his patented long novels (\\"11/22/63\\" weighs in at 849 pages in hardcover), Stephen King delivers another wonderful yarn under the Hard Case Crime imprint. \\"Joyland\\" clocks in at a slim 288 pages in paperback making it the second shortest novel King has ever published, after \\"The Colorado Kid\\", also a Hard Case Crime paperback at 180 pages. The Colorado Kid was not one of my favorite SK novels. In fact, it wasn't very much like anything previous from King, and I thought that Joyland was likely to be more of the same, so I gave it a pass when it first came out. Turns out that was a big mistake on my part.<br /><br />Joyland has all the trademark Stephen King-isms of the past 15 or 20 years. A older man reminiscing about past events that changed his life. Coming of age, loves lost and found, a little boy with a little bit of the \\"Shine\\", friendship, and a cold case serial killer mystery to boot.<br /><br />The writing is as crisp and lean and clean as it could possibly be. For all those clamoring that King \\"needs an editor\\" to \\"remove a few hundred pages\\" from his \\"bloated\\" novels... Read this one! There is no fat, nothing to cut, yet it is a full-fledged novel with all the special SK trimmings. In a recent review of 11/2/63 I commented that the first word that came to mind in describing the writing was \\"mature\\". I felt the same way about Joyland. It is vintage King, tempered by an additional 20 or 30 years of life. It could be classified a murder mystery (that's why the Hard Case Crime imprint instead of one of his usuals) but like the Kennedy assassination in 11/22/63, the murder is more a vehicle around which to tell the story of how 21 year old Devin Jones grows up one extended summer in 1973, and how his life is impacted by his newly-ex girlfriend, the forming of new lifetime friendships with fellow Joyland summer employees, and most of all his relationship with Mike Ross, a little boy with muscular dystrophy and a not-very-bright future and his mom, Annie.<br /><br />I like most of what Stephen KIng writes very much, but only occasionally rate his work 5 stars. In terms of enjoyment per word, this short novel is at the very top of my list<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />J.M. Tepper-bright future and his mom, Annie.<br /><br />I like most of what Stephen KIng writes very much, but only occasionally rate his work 5 stars.

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Love It! The movie was well written, and the cast was outstanding.  At the end of love the brothers love for each other so family love does have a high priority.
B001R1DYWW|5.0|This is a great movie about change that is possible in all people's lives if they are willing to stand up for what they believe in.
B008GWOVOA|5.0|Seen this in the theater back in '93<br />Scared the S*** out of me.<br />Was very well acted by familiar faces and great special effects.<br />DB disappeared after this came out, no doubt due to the fact he carried it and it didn't do well in the theater.<br />Not his fault, he was awesome.
B003B02O7I|5.0|The storyline was believable. I've been in a third world country and enjoyed the nuances of a different culture. I was sickened at the thought of the children getting all that money given their  irresponsible histories.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good courtroom story or someone going into missionary work.<br />The gospel message woven into the story was a pleasant surprise.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Have never bothered with rating a game before but found this game worth it. By far the best puzzle game I've played in awhile. Have never played anything like it and definitely looking forward to more from the makers of this game.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I started playing Dragon Story over a year ago, when I got my first Kindle. Last year, my Kindle was replaced with the Kindle Fire HD. I contacted support to move the game to the new device, and they had it done within a short period of time, completely intact. I love the game. Breeding the dragons to get a specific one can be very frustrating, as the same combination can be used for more than one dragon. I try to visit all my neighbors daily (they can give you gold and maps (used for expanding your island) or if you don't feel like waiting for gold,you can buy it. It,however, took me over a year to find the forums, but once I did find them, I also found a lot of good information there.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is as wonderful as Season 1.  It broadens the characters and make you love them.  I have watched Season 1 and Season 2 repeatedly.
B0013ND36G|5.0|Clearly not the best in the series but the picture is perfect and sound is great.  showed up fast and was just what I wanted.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Great rpg for an app. Not the best ever, but a solid challenge for those who chose not to spend money.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|this is a classic and the remastered  version is excellent.  product showed up fast and just what I wanted. will do business again with them.
0143119680|5.0|AN AWESOME READ CANNOT WAIT TO FINISH THIS UP AND GET INTO PART 2. TOO BAD NEED TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR TO GET THE FINAL CHAPTER.

B00AM0C6YG|3.0|I have to give her time to grow in my ear, because I did not like the CD as a whole on the first take. For me there was a big disconnect between her voice and the musical arrangement. I understand this is her first CD.
B005I7G3EM|5.0|This is one of my family's favorite John Wayne movies. Love seeing Red Buttons. He was someone I remember seeing on TV as a child.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I have to admit, I went into watching this movie with quite a bit of hesitation. I just so, wanted it to be good...er great! And I was so handsomely rewarded. With today's technology, the question for me was, would I be as enthralled, totally swept up in the wonder of it all? A resounding YES! Beautifully costumed, visually captivating.  One tip for the parents out there, the flying monkeys are super-sized in this one. Younger kiddies, beware!
0738727326|5.0|I really like this deck--I'd like to give it about 4.75 stars instead of 5, though, just because the images are so intricate that I have trouble seeing them.  Maybe some new glasses would help.  The cards are certainly the right size to actually use, but I'd like to have a larger set, just to admire.  The fantasy artwork is gorgeous, the kind you want to just sit and gaze at, full of flowers and fairies and beautiful creatures.  I love the box--thank you, Llewellyn Books, for making it easy to open and not so snug that it causes wear on the cards.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|a lot of action.  I did not like the love interest of Shia in this movie.  a shame they were not able to use the previous actress.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app I love horses and this is a fun way to take care of a horse! This is a great app to just play a few games on and have a fun time it works great on the kindle fire hd and my only complaint is sometimes the ads just pop up on the screen which can get annoying.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I am very happy with this DVD.  It is amazingly perfect.  It is everything I expected in quality.  Thank you very much for this order.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It was kind of hard to put down. The story line was intriguing and it kept my attention. I wish it had more than just object hunting games, however. Those are rare.
0062024329|5.0|I am very happy with this book.  It is amazingly perfect.  It is everything I expected in quality.  Thank you very much for this order.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|You have to play this from start to finish with no skipping!!!  Its awesome!  J.Cole put out  one of the top albums of the year with 1 single to push it!  He is the only person rapping on the album even though he has a few features!  Would definitely recommend this to anyone who says they enjoy a good album.
0385349831|5.0|I am very happy with this book.  It is amazingly perfect.  It is everything I expected in quality.  Thank you very much for this order.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was very entertaining to watch. I also love all the music! If you like movies that have a lot of singing in it you will enjoy this movie!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I am very happy with this DVD.  It is amazingly perfect.  It is everything I expected in quality.  Thank you very much for this order.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author is thoughtful and easy to read.  Hard to put down and provocative.  Makes you think how your actions will effect the future
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|I was so hyped when H & G was finally released for home viewing.  zzzzzzzz...huh?  Wha?  Oh, I'm sorry, I fell asleep.  While the action was a lot better than HP, the story line became predictable after a certain point.  Ok but, since when do witches pre-Harry Potter need to use wands?  The gore was a good touch.  Curious though this is supposed to be set in old world style but everyone has straight white teeth?  Hmmmm...they must have good dental.  It was way too short of a movie too.  In the end, the witch got what she deserved but the method was very under whelming.  Not enought panache.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is great and is much more better on the tablet than on a small touch screen phone. Thanks
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Excellent ...this movie  did not disappoint this  very big Wizard of OZ fan!  Everyone can enjoy this movie!  Enjoy yourself and watch this movie!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is great and is some what more difficult on a tablet  than on a small touch screen phone. Thanks
B000001FKY|4.0|Great music delivered to my door for a great price. What more can I say? This disc is exactly what I expected it to be and I am pleased with my pruchase.
0156012197|5.0|Great book to read. I have this in english and in italian. Great book for kids and beginners in another language.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Great music delivered to my door for a great price. What more can I say? This disc is exactly what I expected it to be and I am pleased with my pruchase.
8845205118|5.0|This is a great book and it works best for adult beginners in learning the italian language. Well more so help with those who know a decent amount of vocabulary.
B0012CH350|4.0|Seems to be a quality item compared to some others I have seen. My only minor gripe (very minor) is that it could be just a wee bit bigger. That would make it much easier to take on and off, but otherwise, if it holds up, it will have been well worth the money.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is great  fun and addicting. and is much more better on the tablet than on a small touch screen phone.
B001E75QGG|5.0|Been a fan of Indiana Jones since my teen years. Loved this one - not to mention the Blu-ray quality is exceptional.
0553378384|5.0|Just what I expected. They said it was in good condition and it was slightly used but gave it a good look :)) love my book !
B005M5PENG|3.0|Caan is an idiot!  The show is great but it's like having a clown for a leader.  Lame.  5 stars if they dump Caan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine Craft is awesome. Everybody should play it. Reason 1, you can build almost anything. Reason 2, you can play with people. Reason 3, play Creative Mode and you can fly and destroy stuff easier. Reason 4, play Survival Mode and destroy stuff less easier and you can't fly, but you go against monsters and you'll have to eat food. Hope you like my opinion. P.S. Don't forget to update ;)
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Sometimes a movie really shines and reminds you that filmography is an art form.  True and brilliant art!  Great job!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Every one said she was immature but I think everyone has forgotten what it was like to be single and have more than one person interested in you. I like it ,but I always went with the bad boy . money isn't always everything
1612930425|5.0|I enjoyed revisiting this book and appreciated the condition it was in when I received it. Good book should be read over and over rathen than sitting on a shelf.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I downloaded this app some time ago. I thought it was great. No they have a program attached called mpoints. It`s annoying. You do have the option of turning it off, but mostly I`d like to know when did the weather channel become a gateway to shopping? Furthermore, now there are ads, I don`t know about you, but I get tired off commercials on TV now you think I want to see ads when I`m checking the weather? The forcast information id up to the minute but all around, I`d much rather have the original app style back. Therefore I give you 3 stars, original style 10.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I can't really give this book the rating it deserves, simply because I can't seem to get into it.  I have started and read so much several times, became bored and moved on to something else and then would come back to it.  I got this the day it was released and I still have not managed to finish it.  And truthfully I don't know that I will.
B004PGO25O|5.0|What is between you and your goals?  Behind the excuses is Resistance.  According to successful writer Pressfield, Resistance is an impersonal and hostile  force of nature, not an intrinsic part of our personality.<br />He takes us through a project explaining how R will manifest.  The project can be a novel, a diet, whatever it is that you are not getting done.<br />I enjoyed the style and brevity of the text.  And next time I am mired in R, I will re-read this.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This book is a great map when you decide to start your trip towards the fearful planet of self-publishing. Full with examples, experiences of self-published authors, step by step guides... Makes your fears go away.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Hard to put down -- much more exciting than A Feast For Crows. I'm glad I got the Kindle edition instead of waiting for the paperback version to come out.
B0094LYBT2|5.0|Courageous is a heart wrenching movie that shows you the power of God's love and the healing that can take place with His mercy and Grace.  It is a Christian movie that I highly recommend watching with your family.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|I have always loved Ultravox and this album is truly wonderful. Every song every note and I am amazed that it was not awarded Grammy's for such great song writing. I love this new romantic age music and it is so rare to hear anything like this these days. DO NOT HESITATE AND BUY A COPY. Thank you Ultravox for giving us a great cd.  The sound quality is brilliant, It is too bad there are no more good radio stations in Los Angeles that would play good music because it really should be heard. Vienna, Rage in Eden and Brilliant are my favorite Ultravox albums.  Midge's voice sores and the violin is sweet as usual, After two listens I am singing it already. GREAT ALBUM and let's all hope they do more soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game that is challenging and fun! My coworker showed it to me and now I'm addicted! Love, love, love it!!
B0039RY3MM|5.0|Works incredibly well. Not very easy to apply, but worth the trouble. At least 5 degrees cooler than the best silicone-based TIM you can find.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|The story was told in a beautiful way. The only issue I had was that there seemed to be a couple of characters that just popped in and then disappeared.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate this upgrade. Way too much screen clutter. I also don't care about the awards \\"feature\\" and have no interest in setting up an account. This app also automatically opens a weather.com tab in my web browser. This is a real pain in the neck. The older, simpler app was much easier to view. Please bring it back.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|Who wouldn't love This?? Rush is awesome !  still rocking after 40 years and still touring, it doesn't get better than this !
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Like the ones before I couldnt put this book down! I love how the story is evolving and wait in anticipation for the next book. I would recommend this to all my friends.
B007MDB71O|5.0|this is a great movie it did not get the right kind of press before its release or it would have done much better at the theater
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I named my oldest daughter Meg;  and my grandchildren call me Marmee, after my two favorite characters.  Coz they know how much I LOVE Little Women. I have the entire set by Louisa May Alcott and have read each lovingly.  The movie is Great also - Love to watch it at Christmas .  This book shows the way a loving family unit and respect for each other was meant to be. The world will be a much better place.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|works great on my kindle fire.  no problems with space downloas or game play. if you enjoy killing hijacking or murderer for hire.  this is your game
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Temple Run Oz is a great game it is so realistic and is like the game but amazon didn't have a free purchase of this game
0316228532|5.0|I must say it wasn't at all what I expected, but I was very impressed.  Like many who loved Harry Potter, I was anxious to see what she would do next.  My only complaint is that the beginning was a little slow, but as it unfolded and I realized how detestable the majority of the characters are, I still found them intriguing.  That alone should be a turn off for anyone looking for something as light and fun as Harry.  With this book she delves into a place that simply makes people uncomfortable and for that I applaud her.  Where Harry was fantasy, The Casual Vacancy is hyper-real.  Truth of the matter is that people do live in crippling poverty.  People are addicted to drugs.  This is the world we live in and it's a heartbreaking portrayal of neglect, dysfunction and how ugly human beings can actually be.<br /><br />No it's not a lighthearted read; it gutted me and made me cry.  I would absolutely not recommend it to someone that's looking for anything remotely like Harry Potter; a fantasy.  Still, it's one of those books that got under my skin and I can't stop thinking about it.  Bravo, Jo.  I didn't know you had it in you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|the best! such a great show. nice to watch something different. everyone i know who watches this show is highly addicted
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|This edition looks great and is packed with extra features. We have enjoyed adding this on to our collection. A great deal!
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|i love the album. and the menahan street band is groovy as balls. go get the album! thumbs up amazon
1416955070|1.0|Despite all the \\"amazing\\" reviews, and the jazzed up movie trailer, this books was a disappointment. I read up to about page 100 or so, and then I just flipped randomly through pages, I could stomach no more.  This book was incredibly boring. I did not connect to any of the characters or their many plights.  I found the writing to be very immature, stilted and at times downright confusing.  There wasn't anything humorous in the story, I didn't find myself laughing along with Clary's antics, or her \\"witty\\" little digs.<br /><br />To me, Clary was very immature, and Jace the \\"magical\\" guy stuck up and snotty...not a likable combination.  I also found it pretty pathetic that the author reveals so much information and \\"clues\\" about Clary's father in the first few chapters of the book.  Keeping the reader in suspense and drawing out the storyline makes the reader WANT to continue reading the book.  However, with all the information provided and little hints here and there it was downright laughable to discover the relationship the big bad boss Valentine (what kind of evil guy goes by this name anyway?) had to Clary.<br /><br />This is not a book I will ever continue to read again, and sadly it really turned me off from wanting to see the movie as well.  I really wanted to enjoy this series as I love Fantasy/Science Fiction YA material.
B0001XPZGA|3.0|The album: 5 stars<br />The vinyl: 1 star<br /><br />I love this album - it's one that you can listen to in its entirety over and over without tiring from it.  With that said, the vinyl quality of this is terrible, I think this batch was pressed from a damaged master.  I ordered one, it skipped (not popped, skipped) so I exchanged it, and the replacement skipped in the same spots. I don't know if I will do this a third time, I think it's futile.  But I must say, through everything Amazon's Customer Service has always been great.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|great and easy read.The book even for an adult to read, cant wait for the next one. Now I can go see the movie.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun interactive game. It fits into the show 's storyline, and stands alone well. The mechanics work well. The puzzles are also fun and challenging.<br />It is good for kids and adult fans.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I found these books to be very interesting, and can't wait to find out what happens next in this series
0060512806|2.0|This is the first book I didn't finish for which I still have the temerity to write a review. As others have mentioned, Stephenson's prose is fine - it's just there is so, so very much of it, and to no purpose. Also, I was not able to uncover a plot in the 272 pages I read completely, nor was there one in the additional hundred pages as I forged ahead as if I were a healthy person going for help for injured hikers. Unfortunately, the book died for me at page 372. It just stopped breathing - very peaceful. Requiescat in pace.<br /><br />It would be great if cover blurbs included warnings: \\"Multiple Point of View Novel! Read knowing author will take you to another character if one finally gets interesting.\\"<br /><br />This is the second book I've read recently brought low by a total absence of editing. Publishers: if I'm to buy books in the future, you'll need to do a little more on your end.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Kind of dumb. Not what I expected. To simple for adults so I thought I'd have my kids try and they didn't like it either.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Love this CD, I am a big Ke$ha fan, her songs are great, and fun, and been listening to it nonstop
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love the game, but I am constantly getting disconnected from it.  Occasionally I get my &#34;Bingo credits&#34; back, but not every time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A coworker suggested this book to me and I loved it.  It was a quick read, but the story line is very cute.  In a quick summary, it's about a teenage girl who has cancer and falls in love for the first time in her life.  The boy she falls in love with also has cancer.  It is a very cute love story. Sad and humorous at the same time.  Quick, fantastic read!
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|This is the continuation of a romantic man meets man in military, man looses man in tragic military conflict and years later after becoming a doctor who is unhappy with self and life, he meets another younger active military man and falls in love again. Truly sweet and romantic. Have to read subtitles to this Israeli movie, but well worth it if you also viewed the part one.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I found this book to be very boring. I think the premise was very good..but the follow thru was not there...play game....someone be mean to him....he gets in a fight....then the cycle repeats....it was very hard to get through this book. I was told there are more in this series but I have no interest in any more in this series...
B008NA2HMI|4.0|A book for the time. I really enjoyed Jordan Belforts journey and wonder if we will learn from what he has laid out before us.
023076651X|5.0|This book is a driving force behind anyone who needs it. It helps you to realize that there is money to be made out there to satisfy your dreams....not someone else's.
B004BEMC6G|1.0|Do not buy this from amazon instant.<br /><br />The movie looked pretty interesting, but the sound quality is terrible.<br />It sounds like you are listening to it over a walkie-talkie
1416583432|2.0|The book \\"Inside of a Dog\\" by Alexandra Horowitz has its' moments however they are far and few between. The book from my point of view is for the most part pretty boring and full of doggy doo doo. The author likes to frequently use unusual words so if you want to get closer to the totality of understanding many of her statements you should have a pretty decent dictionary within reach while reading this book. For instance, to \\"provoke a demure averal of a dog's gaze.\\" isn't something I readily have a connection with. This 350 page book could have been reduced to 100 pages. Statements such as, \\"There is more direct eye contact among humans speaking intimately or honestly, and we tend to extend that conversational dynamic to our dogs. We call their names before speaking to them, like willing, if taciturn, interlocutors.\\" Lets put it this way, I've had several dogs over my 65 years of existence and the latter part of this statement by the author to me at best is random conjecture. As far as I am concerned this book has probably sold most of its copies based solely on its title. I found the book mostly subjective and speculative on the author's part and 1/2 way through I decided to give it to my dogs. They don't seem to get it either.
0955153077|5.0|a great book with many tips and secrets to help people paint on there computer and some really helpful points that i haven't found in any other book
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. I don't need anything fancy just a calculator that's easy to use. I got it with calculator plus. Keys are big. It functions well. I downloaded it to my kindle fire. Haven't had any problems.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|very poor video quality and often had to stop to buffer. when there was a lot of movement, it got very blurry. dont think I will order through amazon instant again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book. A book you would figure to be a typical conspiracy theory turns out to be a splendid love affair between two people that needed one another. Brilliant.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game is fun but still a little challenging.. you will enjoy playing(: . This game makes you think lol . I got stuck a few times but finally figured it out .
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|The Adventures of Tom Sayer never gets old. I have read and reread this book countless times since grade school. Highly recommended.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|I DID NOT LIKE IT I LOVE IT!<br />IT THE BEST ABLUM EVER!<br /> AND IT BETTER THEN THE FRIST TWO ALBUM'S
B006L9B6TI|2.0|Gave this as a gift to someone in Trinidad and the person cannot download it - the message is that it is not available for download in Trinidad.  You should give me back my money.
B000002KHB|3.0|I thought I was getting the Machine Head 2-disc set as referenced by the reviewers.  That is the set with the original recordings on one disc and the remixed version on the second disc.  What I got is the single disc copy of the original Machine Head for $23.59.  Obviously I would not have paid $23.59 for a single disc of the original version.  Disappointing...will try to resolve with Amazon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addicting!  You only have so many birds to tackle so many pigs.  If you miss clearing the level, you can't help but go back and try again and again and again.  I'm sure younger players have it all figured out right away, but as a senior, it takes a little longer.  I use it to keep my mind active.  Lots of fun.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I only gave it 2 stars because the graphics are cute.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cute graphics, just like the movie.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not intuitive, difficult to figure out.<br />In-App purchases. Can't do much without coughing up cash.
0425263924|5.0|The story is great. Can't wait till the next book. Couldn't put it down. It's a more vanilla version of fifty shades.
B0063IH60K|3.0|What's to say,  It is solitaire as has been played for generations.  Something to do when really bored or just want to sit and relax for a few moments.  Do like the &#34;display&#34; when the game is won.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I can watch this movie over and over and not tire of it.  I do think that this film would be better if the original actor cast as Bilbo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings would have been cast as Bilbo in The Hobbit.  Love the score.  I have one problem with this DVD:  It is not in 3D,  so I'll give it a 4 out of 5.
0307352153|4.0|A very useful and valuable book for introverts trying to figure out our place in the world.  I just wish that the chapters on raising introverted children imagined a much more realistic world - one where things like the internet, xbox and social (?) media exist in fact and have such controlling power over the lives of younger and younger children.  I don't know how these things play into concepts of introversion and extroversion, I just know that they are taking over more and more of every young person's waking moments, and the shallow, cheap and often aggressively negative  interactions experienced in this world must certainly have dramatic impacts on the personalities of our children, introverted or otherwise.  Excluding the realities of modern life in a book about coping with modern life seems a rather serious omission in an otherwise excellent book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app! I'm a notebook junkie and to have them all in one place and accessible from all of my devices is amazing. The web clipper is just what I needed, I can clip pics, articles etc and send them right to their correct notebook. I was actually able to get rid of a lot of paper with this app.
0143113100|5.0|Well written.  Information was fresh and well presented.  This information could be important to a lot of people.  I find myself bringing up things I read in this book as I talk to people...a good sign!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Extremely cute movie.  Was entertaining and watchable for the entire family, toddlers to grandparents.  Would recommend this one for fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyable and challenging as you get to higher levels. Fun and can be played by most ages. Some levels require patience.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Action packed.  Was entertaining and felt I got my money's worth.  A little different than the original, but  liked it.
B003PTP4S6|3.0|Wonderful, wonderful music, but the tracks are bizarrely edited.  Gabriel's Oboe also includes the first 1/3 of The Falls, and the actual The Falls is missing that same chunk.  Amazon should do a better job.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is a great way to take care of a horse without any problems like poop or smell or biting horse flys
B008Y73940|3.0|Was a little disappointed but worth the watch at home.  Had high hopes for this one.  Good enough for a rainy day movie.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS MOVIE ----THE ACTING WAS GREAT ----SANDRA BULLOCK AND KEANU REEVES ARE MAGIC IN THIS MOVIE --------I JUST LOVED IT AND THE TWO ACTORS, ALSO.<br /><br />DWISSICK@TAMPABAY.RR.COM
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love the variety and selection of these Sudoku games along with the different degrees of difficulty.  I am enjoying them completely.
0441013597|5.0|It is the greatest book I have ever read. Interesting, beautiful, introspective and trippy. The perfect sci-fi novel.<br /><br />Not a good one for children. The language is...differentl.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like. it is very fun I would buy it and the best part it is freeeeee. would you want to see a varity. of games then this is the app for you. if you like older that is fine there are some for you too
B0000TB014|5.0|It came in excellent condition and it is great to watch. I secretly sing and dance along with it when no ones home.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics and fun for all ages. I love all the different horses and mini games to help care for the horse.
B00338QENI|5.0|As a scientist, this was a very good historical book that I think every scientist should read. Every doctor should read this as well. Perhaps, it wail keep us reminded that every tissue we use comes from a individual like us.<br />As an African American, it was very inspirational and an important part of my history!
1614270198|5.0|I loved the simplicity of it.  I learned so much from this book about the subconscious mind and how we need to be positive and honest with our body.  I am now, not only, a follower of Dr. Murphy I believe in myself and know that healing is inevitable if I have faith.<br /><br />I love the book, I read parts of it every day and I feel good.<br /><br />Lois
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I have other games like wedding salon and makeup salon. I love games like this!! there so fun.Ilike how we can yo the acne scrub
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It works just like a regular calculator except for the fact that it is an app. There isn't much that I can really say about that.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I'm a fan of all the Hobbit movies, Lord of the Rings and such. I love the unity amongst the good guys and the battle against evil as well as many good moral lessons.<br />My only problem was with the quality of the movie as I streamed it off Amazons site. I have a 53 inch HD TV and the quality was very choppy. I recommend renting or just buying the movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Does what it says it does.  Very complete  I use it on my kindle and it is very accurate. Good app
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Wish there were more levels can't get enough of the game want there to be more<br />Keeps me coming back for more....
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game I have it on my Ipad, Kindle and Windows phone and tablet.  Can't stop playing it
0394400267|3.0|Fiction or non-fiction?  Either way, if you are interested in history this is an interesting book to add to the collection which covers the significant and more subdued happenings in the everyday life of the 14ht century.  I found it a challenge to read at times but overall I gained additional knowledge of the world at that time.
B005PD0VDI|1.0|The product was formatted for European DVD players AND was in Italian even if I COULD watch it. I felt this should have been more PROMINANT in the description, like AT THE TOP! I do not have the time or energy to go through the return process........NOT HAPPY WITH THIS ONE!
0307279189|5.0|Even though my daughter is a runner and has been for years, I got this book for her and she absolutely loved it and it encouraged her to increase her running endurance.  Excellent book-highly recommended.
B00CFYD682|4.0|Why I haven't read more about Alison being a precursor to Adele is beyond me.  They both possess uniquely earthly voices.  Moyet moves back to more pop-friendly material and with great results.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Getting this app is much better then side loading the regular YouTube app onto you Kindle. I have both of them on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Here are some PRO's & CON's for both.<br /><br />vTube PRO's:<br />- You can sign in to your YouTube account.<br />- You can also change the quality of the video.<br /><br />YouTube PRO's:<br />- The user interface is familiar.<br /><br />vTube CON's:<br />- Only 1 account synced at a time.<br /><br />YouTube CON's:<br />- No account sign in at all.<br /><br />PRO's for Both:<br />- They can both watch videos in HD<br /><br />CON's for Both:<br />- No CON's are shared by these 2.<br /><br />Conclussion:<br />vTube is the better of the 2 simply because it allows you to sign in while the standard YouTube app does. The best YouTube replacement for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|If you're an Agnetha fan, there's no reason not to own this--it does her proud.  Her voice is in fine form and weaves its way through a wonderful song selection.  Just not sure yet if there's a major goosebump-inducing tune in the batch!
B0059WTMLW|2.0|Would be a five except must be signed in to app store to play. Very disappointed. Unins talled as soon as that message popped up.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I laughed, I cried. I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would, so happy I watched it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Good graphics &amp; a lot of fun racing through all kinds of things.  You switch drivers, cars, paint cars, earn coins, beat the clock, etc.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I recommend this app to folk who wish to download videos from YouTube on their mobile phones. You can choose the quality of the videos you download. You can choose to download Videos as mp3 files, but I haven't used this; I have a converter on my phone.  It's easy, intuitive to use, no hassle. I changed that bit about too busy, after using it awhile the intuitiveness of its design apparent. It is easier to download with this app, even some videos I could not download with the regular YouTube app or at the website on my desktop.<br />I use it more than I use the YouTube app. This should be the YouTube App; I dont use the YouTube at all now.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Though the eyes of a dog ,heart of man,and fearless of a beast ,Buck's journey take you to the edge and back.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Led Zeppelin within 9 albums showed mastery of almost every music genre; they honored the blues by expanding its language.  They were cool, they were fiery, they were appropriate to the venue, ethos, and moods that swung with the best and transcended.<br /><br />I like 'em.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I was always hoping I'd find a method of jotting down notes with my Kindle Fire from Amazon.com. I was in church today and one of the youngsters was writing in his, so I asked, &#34;how'd you get that&#34;? He said go to the App Store and sure enough, now I can jot notes as I learn more about Jesus, PTL!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have neglected using the right love language to communicate with my wife for years.  This helped me understand how I need to change the way I show my love.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|To me this is a great documentary about the music recording industry and how a part of history has been saved.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I really enjoyed this simple to play &quot;old school&quot; Invaders shooter game.  Plenty of challenging targets and weapons to pickup too.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Would have been a 5, but a puzzle piece coincides with  the back button on my kindle and I can't finish the game .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is different from other games out there, so that makes it fun and entertaining especially for a free game!
B004XWLN20|5.0|My husband loves it. He is a big super hero fan, so the smallville series was a perfect gift for him.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Show starts a little slow, pulling you in deeper with each episode.  Expect to find yourself questioning the motives of each character and how they all relate.  The serious tone of the business is cut with witticisms that keep upu looking for more.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|So far - the very best album of B.O.C. - mysterious, sometimes a bit creepy:) yet unbelieveably charming and touching. Compliments to amazon.com - lovely package and quick delivery. Gonna use your service in the future, thanks a lot, good luck!:)
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book changed my view towards life and brought in magical results. The best part is that the knowledge given here is based on scientific basis and the daily practices are simple yet effective.  Highly recommended for everyone! have a blessed life you all.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft pe is a great game but however my minecraft is 7.1 and not able to upgrade to 7.2 it stinks because I can't be the host over a multiplayer match. Other than that it's a must get game.<br /><br />Peace,love,minecraft
B001NA6096|5.0|both of the actors are great and even though the movie is almost a big never-ending dialogue it manages to keep the viewer engaged, entertained.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|This movie was on par with other Star Trek movies and we were watching it in prep for watching the new release.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I have to admit, I had a very hard time even ordering this movie because I had heard too many people say that bond had converted to drinking ale's instead o the signature vodka martini &#34;shaken not stirred&#34;.<br />However, since they worked arund it by not having him being seen ordering a drink through the entire movie, i was pleased, even though you do see him drinking other things, he makes no mention of the signature drink so it was a bit easier to well &#34;swallow&#34; pardon the pun. For future movies, I do hope the writer/director get's his/her head out of their butt's and bring Bond back to drinking what he should be. If you want to make a movie of someone drinking beer, better focus on Felix, HE is the one that drank beers NOT BOND. Don't change such an iconic detail! t kils the feel of the movie. Other than that, the movie was great. Top notch acting by all!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game, I found it fun and even my 4 year old granddaughter wanted to play it with me. She got excited everytime we found a clue.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Yea, Pretty good on action, same as the other Bourne movies but also lots of dull times when everyone is barely speaking above a whisper and trying to figure out, &#34;is it Bourne or someone else?&#34; Too much &#34;dead air&#34; in my opinion but otherwise it's a pretty decent movie
1400067936|3.0|I read Nassim Taleb's \\"The Black Swan\\" a couple of years ago, and now I got around to reading his previous book, \\"Fooled by Randomness\\". This is the book that made Taleb famous for his theory about the role of chance in markets. Taleb says that humans tend to explain away random events by rationalising them, instead of accepting that life has an element of randomness in it. He examines biases such as causality, \\"survivorship\\" (learning only from winners) and skewed distributions. Fortune magazine named \\"Fooled\\" as one of the smartest books of all time. I'm not so sure. While I share Taleb's contempt for the inhabitants of Wall Street, I feel the pendulum has swung too much in the opposite direction. True, not everything can be explained and rationalised; but not everything in life is down to Lady Fortuna either.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I Like that the sounds are soft And not too Loud which is a probLem with some other simiLar apps that are supposed to heLp you reLax . This one is Different: the Softness of MANY/Most of the sounds heLp you reLax .
0451209338|4.0|\\"The Kill Artist\\" is the first book in the Gabriel Allon series by Daniel Silva. Allon is a retired Mossad agent, spending his time restoring famous art paintings in a secluded house in southern England. His former boss turns up one day with an offer Allon can't refuse: join him in hunting down and killing Tariq al-Hourani, the Palestinian terrorist responsible for killing Allon's son and seriously wounding his wife. This is a great spy novel, a fast read.
B007IXGUG0|4.0|I like some of the songs on the album the rest of the songs may have to grow on me first but its ok
159420411X|3.0|I bought \\"The Signal and the Noise\\" after I saw a recommendation (I think it was in \\"The Economist\\"). As everyone knows by now, Nate Silver became famous after correctly predicting the outcome of the US election, down to the last state. In this book, he strives to separate the chaff from the wheat when it comes to predictions about the future. In Silver's words, \\"the difference between what we know and what we think we know\\". He urges us to think in probabilistic terms, explaining Bayes Theorem of conditional probability and why he thinks it's relevant to almost any prediction: baseball scores, politics, stock market, etc. He calls for more modesty from TV pundits, and that is hardly a call one can argue with.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Harkening back to Heartbreaker & Cold Roses, this is a must have for any Ryan Adams fan. As long as he keeps making records I'll keep buying & listening!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|The latest update includes cartoons. My grandchildren play this game and I prefer they not have this option, but there is no way to disable it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|a fun game with great puzzles to figure out how to escape from the rooms.  would recommend to anyone who likes to solve puzzles.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie featuring old but talented actors with Dustin Hoffman making his debut as a director.  It had a few good moments, usually involving Maggie Smith (no surprise there).  But I often found the dialog and plot tedious, boring and unoriginal. Fortunately with a streaming movie one can use the mouse to click and speed things up which I did to cut out about 15 minutes or more.
1451695195|1.0|I was given this book to read by a patient. While I am not a neurosurgeon, I am a doctor and I have cared for plenty of patients who had a nontraumatic coma similar to the one this surgeon had. He worked with patients who were in coma due to brain damage. I worked with patients who had coma due to illness. The first erroneous thing this doctor said was in the prologue-coma is not a condition where the \\"neocortex\\" shuts down. Coma is a range of conditions manifested by varying degrees of unresponsiveness and there isn't a single part that's affected more than the others-in fact, I'm not quite sure was this neuroanatomist means by \\"neocortex\\", it's, at best, a gross oversimplification. I've had patients who've told me their comas were much like having some awareness of the hospital but being unable to respond. Knowing that, this book reads like a fanciful dream modelled after the doctor's learned expectations of \\"heaven\\". I'm sure that if he had been raised in India, the \\"heaven\\" he experienced would have one of enlightenment free of the task of reincarnation. As it is, we get the WASP version of heaven. He says he is unable to work now-why would he need to? He has millions of dupes lining up to buy his book.
1594202842|4.0|I'm just reading this book several years after its publication.  However, I have been aware of the controversy surrounding this book since it was first released.  The author, Amy Chua, forthrightly admits that she subscribes to the practice of \\"Chinese parenting,\\" which she also fully acknowledges is controversial in the United States.  And boy has it ever been!  So long before I read the book, I heard many of the criticisms launched at the author for her extreme and critical parenting stance.  And, honestly, it is all true.  She did force her three year-old child to stand outside in the bitter cold as a punishment for not practicing the piano.  She did reject home-made birthday cards from her children as unacceptable.  She did force her daughters to practice their instruments for hours on end.  She did criticize them if they came in anything other than first.<br /><br />But the other thing is . . . she did raise exceptional children.<br /><br />I read the book expecting to hate this mother and her crazy, critical, extreme parenting.  But I found that I didn't.  She was refreshing in her honesty.  She admittedly learned lessons from her parenting and learned to calm down somewhat.  Her daughters came to love playing musicical instruments.<br /><br />I still think her parenting style is far too harsh and extreme.  Even \\"Chinese mothers\\" must admit that not every child can be number one in every way . . . after all, there are other \\"Chinese mothers\\" out there.<br /><br />But, as a mother myself, I admit that it is a fine line between pushing children too hard and not pushing them enough.<br /><br />And, at a minimum, love her or hate her, you will find the book an interesting read.
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|I have not had the chance to view this movie as of yet. I realized I had purchased the wrong Lincoln movie. I'm sure I will enjoy it nonetheless. Thanks
B004LWZW9C|5.0|This was a great movie and enjoyed it . Was a group night watching and had to keep up with movie. Will watch again but worth the money indeed.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Wow!!!! This is one of the AMAZING game I have ever played on kindle. You can use a lot of weapons and you could also get a partner to help you kill the zombies. The graphics is really good and it's really smooth. So far I haven't had a problem with this game. I really  enjoyed this game and I'm addicted to it. I really recommend this game to everyone and it's free, who doesn't want a free game? No one! Good! So everyone get this game and  you won't regret it.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This is one of my favotie shows. I can not wait until the movie comes out. Totally worth the rewatch in prep for the movie.
0316223239|5.0|The book arrived in a timely manor. There were no problems with the book, and it is one of the strongest books I've read in a while
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game it was challenging but not to hard. But I wish that it had more levels. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants to have fun.
1781162646|2.0|typical Steven King with workmanlike story telling. The culprit was clearly identified at the beginning as was the clairvoyant boy.  Most irritating is King's insistence on inserting his political opinions in everything he writes.  How often, for example, do we have to hear about Dick Chaney's heart transplant?  Certainly, we would hope, not in an escapist trifle like this.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies of all time. It's funny and romantic and in a good price. All three caracters had their unique completion.  Colin so righteous, Hugh the lady lover and Bridget between those two.
B00127RAJY|5.0|great program and worth the money. I will be doing it again and again. It is definitely worth the money !
B005CGI4EG|3.0|I was fine with the packaging. I was however disappointed that the music is a cheesy musical number instead of the Sinatra 'Love & Marriage'
B0038AL7EW|2.0|package was good, but can't play it in my player, yet to figure that out. Probably due to intl code
B007JMW46U|5.0|I already have the same book from a previous purchase, but when I discovered this version had copies of the original artwork that went into the magazines where Sherlock Holmes was serially published, I just had to get it. It was well worth it. A simple &#34;double click&#34; blows up the picture on my screen. It makes me feel like I'm actually part of what the original readers experienced...the only difference is I already know how the stories end. I love the artwork. It brings an additional dimension to the works.
B00993FEUK|3.0|I ordered the ParaNorman Blu Ray disk. They sent me the RENTAL version, which does not come with ANY extra features! On second check, I realised that it was my mistake as I did not see that the disk was RENTAL copy. Please see carefully before you place an order
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really fun and makes you think! Some  things are easy to figure out, which is good as you don't want to get a headache, but others really make you figure out what goes where. Recommend this app to all!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I liked how the story started immediately in the beginning no build up to the story line. Bradley Cooper was fantastic
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|The movie sound interesting and we decided to give it a shot.  The movie turned out to be a good action scifi movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I got the Kindle version; there are very few typos, and they don't detract from the reading experience.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good book. I'm not good at reviewing books, but I can say that, after a few chapters in, it was hard to put the book down.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This edition, like MOST of the others, has some awesome casting. Chris Pine is perfectly, Kirk and cheeky and Spock, Bones and Scotty are awesome interpretations of younger versions of the original characters. Add a good story and it's like the perfect movie. It's my current &#34;stress relief via humor&#34; remedy so I've watched it several times or just had it playing in the background while doing other things. When I'm WAY wound up, it's just enough of a LESS wound up thing to get the unwinding started. For less critically wound up days, I just use various episodes of Dr. Who...of course. ROFL!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Awesome Game. Blast to play. Soundtrack could use a little work but that's my only bad thing to say if you could call that a bad thing.
0062255657|5.0|Some books are gifts; this book is one of those. I did not wish to read this quickly, I tried to slow down so I could slowly savor it over the course of at least a week.  I mixed other books into my diet and killed time in other pleasant ways, however I only was able to ration out my reading into three days. Thank you, Mr. Gaiman and not to sound ungrateful, but please, continue the story!
B00908DDZM|5.0|The best CD I have bought in a long time. I am very happy with my purchase! I love this guy
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book and its series.  Would recommend to anyone who loves romance books.  A must have series for all readers
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book kept my interest from Chapter one. Gideon and Eva's chemistry was like no other. The passion they had for each other kept me turning the pages of this book and I found it hard to put the book down. I think this book's story line was better than Bared by You, and I though that was a good book.
0425263924|5.0|Loved this series of books.  Recommend it for anyone who loves romance books.  This series is very provocative and leaves you wanting to read more.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|QUICK OVERVIEW:<br />+Interesting characters give way to a compelling and complex story<br />+Puzzles are fun<br />+Multiple endings give the game great replay value<br />+Simple sprites and the sketched scenes work great in tandem with the text<br /><br />-Playing the same puzzle over and over again gets tedious after the second or third time<br /><br />Once you start playing 999 you won’t be able to put it down. It’s a dark, twisted tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end of the game. To put it simply Nine Hours Nine Persons Nine Doors is a book in video game format, so if you hate reading then turn away now and never look back because this is not for you. If that isn't the case then continue on!<br /><br />The main character Junpei is an average college student awakens to find himself aboard a sinking ship. With a vague memory of how he got there or what happened, he sets out to discover what's going on. After meeting up with eight other people, all who share the same story and experience, it's then that ‘Zero’ the mastermind behind the kidnappings reveals that Junpei and the others are lucky enough to participate in something known as the Nonary Game. The rules are simple, you have nine hours to escape the ship, and in order to do so you must find the door with the 9 on it. The number on your bracelet determines what rooms you can enter and with who, break any of these rules and the punishment is simple- death.<br /><br />Fair warning though, the game earns it's M warning, while never going over the top, 999 leaves the details to your imagination, and the text.<br />There’s never a relaxing moment through the course of the game, you always have the fact that death is imminent if you don’t solve the puzzles, follow the rules, or escape the sinking ship. Every moment and choice you make counts.<br /><br />Game play is split into three different sections, novel, puzzle, and room. Novel like the name suggests is the narrative portion of the game, where the plot tends to move forward, and takes place in between the puzzle and room sections.<br /><br />The room sections are essentially point and click, if you’ve played an ‘escape the room’ game online you’ll get the basics of what’s going on pretty fast. You are able to look around the area, must locate and combine clues to solve puzzles, then move onto the next room.<br /><br />The real action is with the puzzles, they vary from paying a song on the piano to putting down a winning hand in blackjack. Never fret because the game always gives you a hint or how to, especially when it comes to the more interesting puzzles. In the beginning puzzles are simple but as you progress towards the end they become more difficult though never to the point that you can't accomplish what you need to.<br /><br />What 999 does an excellent job of is incorporating themes into the puzzles and rooms. For example a little snippet of conversation about ice might seem completely irrelevant to the current situation but in the long run has great significance.<br /><br />The characters are developed in a way that makes you care about them, but at the same time stay wary of their intentions. From the hulking giant only known as Seven to the sparsely dressed woman going by the codename Lotus each one has a back story and almost seem real.<br />The best part of the game is the multiple endings, which give 999 great replay value. The endings, there are 6 in total, are compelling and keep you wanting to play more. Be wary though, if your like the person who had played the game before me (I bought the game used) then you might feel cheated with what you get, don't let it discourage you, unlike most games out there, these endings each carry weight and are important to the overall plot. There are four ‘bad’ endings, one true ending, and one joke ending. While this might not make sense right now it does when everything comes to the light.<br /><br />The best thing about the replay is the fact you have the option to zoom through the text you’ve already read. When you come across text or a scene you haven’t experienced the game stops the fast forwarding and resumes normal speed. Another thing that 999 does right is you don’t have to remember all the choices you’ve made in the past, the game highlights previous decisions you’ve made making it easier for you to choose another route or path.<br /><br />There are only one real negative, repetition. You'll have to go through some of puzzles you’ve already played, while this doesn’t really hinder the game, it does make it tedious at times. The upside is the puzzles are really simple once solved, so finding and combing the right elements make them that much faster on the second or even third time through.<br /><br />Graphic wise 999 isn’t that impressive, it does feature sketched scenes depicting the current action going on which are beautiful to look at and give the text that much more life. Characters are portrayed as sprites and have little hints of animation here and there, such as a hair bouncing, mouths moving, or arms swinging every now but nothing really notable. You won’t find any voice acting throughout the entirety of the game, but that’s not really a problem.<br /><br />The music and sound effects are moving and applied very well creating tension in an already tense environment. Little things like listening to ship creek while the characters argue amongst themselves about the best course of action give the game its impact and effect.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I enjoyed switching between modern and war-era London. Easy reading drama/mystery. A bit predictable but likeable and not taxing. I think the author handles the historical characters and plot better than the modern setting. I could see war torn London during the Blitz and felt the heightened anxiety.
B009SPUSN2|4.0|This group of portal songs really brings back memories of playing the actual game. I would recommend these songs for anyone who is a fan of Portal 2.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This includes all 8 films of the Harry Potter series! Me and my brother watched all of them from start to finish and he loved every minute of it (I've seen all of them countless times of course).
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Couldn't put it down, starting the next one as soon as I can.  Highly recommended, highly entertaining as well ,
B007W8S2MG|5.0|If you have a Vita and you love JRGPs then Persona 4 Golden is the game for you. Don't miss out on this wonderful game as you will love it as much as I do. I've poured in over 100 hours of gameplay and till this day I've yet to get the True Ending. That's right! This game has more 3 different endings and more than enough content to go around!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Awesome game. Reminds me of the first medal of honor game. Excellent graphics for a tablet, controls a little jerky.
0553276646|5.0|I followed every move of Mr. Feynman. As we say these days he thought \\"out of the box\\" but even better he acted in a practical way. How I wish I could do so well.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|We enjoyed the movie.  Downloaded it using our Roku.  The movie has lots of action!  Craig makes for a perfect 007.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is my favorite and I'm positive that I will totally buy the full vers<br /><br />Amazing get it get it get it
0307887960|4.0|This book is well-written and very easy to follow. There is an excellent explanation of the background of this diet that makes good sense.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Will Smith leads a cast of amazing actors to fight against an evil race of aliens. The plot is definitely well done and the quality of acting is fitting for the situation. A little too much tongue and cheek here and there but understandable.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this is a good game to occupy people's time and a good way to relax and think at the same time. This game has lots of levels to complete and time trials. In time trials, you can make personal records and try to beat them. It's a fun game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  It's addictive.  I have it on my phone and had to get it on my kindle so I would not use all my data.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Can't remember last time I was a movie with Streisand, some of the dialog seemed un rehearsed, but I know mothers like that.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Very cute for kids entertainment but it takes up a lot of space on your device. So, I recommend downloading this on an expandable memory card.  I deleted it from my tablet and downloaded it again on the SD and it is fine. Again, good for entertaining kids on a long drive or to occupy them when on rainy days!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good game and addictive too, but I have a lot of trouble logging into Facebook but other than that it's a good game LOVE IT
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a nice game.  It is challenging enough to not be boring but not so hard that is is frustrating.  I wish you could save your progress within a level though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I want you to buy this book so that Hugh Howey writes more books. At times, the story seems dark. The lives doomed. But hang in there. It is so good. You unravel the mystery as the characters do. Howey knows his craft. He's going places and I want to come along for the ride.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a fun game that lets you make your own park. The only thing is they need more options for the social aspect of the game. You can visit a friend park but you can't do anything to help them, or see what animals they have.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|The premise was about robots carrying on a mad scientists work long after he was dead. Sounds like modern day progressives in government.<br /><br />I added this to Angelina Mollie collection.
1401937519|5.0|By surviving a near death experience, Anita Moorjani learns a few valuable lessons for leading a rich life here on earth...  Express your uniqueness fearlessly... True happiness is found in loving yourself.  Follow your heart and do what brings you joy.  When you feel lost it is because you've lost your sense of self.  When this happens, center yourself by meditating, walking, or listening to to music.  Then the outside world will change and obstacles will fall away.  Each one of us is a gift to those around us in the tapestry of life and helping one another is how we weave a beautiful tapestry.  Answers you seek are already within you.  Laugh daily and often.  If what you do is driven by passion and zest for living then you are being.  If your actions are a result of fear, you are doing.  The external world mirrors what we feel about ourselves.  Follow your heart and know you can't go wrong.  Unconditional self love increases energy and the universe acts kind.  These are all really good words to live by and Anita Moorjani, a woman once cancer ridden is now completely cancer free, heeding her own profound discoveries, and leading a healthy life of riches.
1446302474|4.0|I was eager to see this book at my local store, but it just doesn't hold a technical candle to \\"The Art of Manipulating Fabric\\" by Collette Wolff, which I've owned, loved and referenced for years. BUT...  I'm an advanced sew-er, and this might be just the thing for a beginning or intermediate who wants to try something new without being overwhelmed by the encyclopedia's worth of techniques presented by Wolff. Ms. Singer's site shows that she's greatly interested in teaching new sew-ers, so I might be right about her target audience. Regardless, don't miss pics of her gallery work - creative and charming! Wish I were closer to visit.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I've not had this app long but find it very useful when planning things ahead. Quick and easy to use. Handy to keep an eye on the weather day to day . Would of been better to have a pollen count as well. Thus would of been very useful.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie was perfect for a family stay at home day.  Both kids (ages 4 and 10) enjoyed it, and my husband and I did, too.  I love a story that gets you to cheer for the bad guy who then becomes good.  A must see, and the sequel was just as wonderful.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Very interesting experience. The author is a real energizer. He used to lose everything all his life long and had found at list not bad way for him. He had unlocked the SYSTEM, may be for You, reader.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played on the kindle fire. I recommend this for anyone who likes to create things.
1891252089|5.0|Besides the fact that David Swenson is one of my teachers, this book is well written....instructions are clear and concise, photos are easy to follow too.  David covers all aspects of the Ashtanga Yoga class....I bought a copy for one of my more dedicated Yoga students and she loves it!  I  highly recommend this book for not only learning Ashtanga, but to learn about Yoga in general.
B009X01ELC|4.0|Works as advertised! Switching from vertical and horizontal viewing is effortless! Love the soft cover and the solid support. Wish it had a latched cover and a magnet to turn off/standby the kindle when cover is closed.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The history is very interesting and it hooks you. The details in which the author describes the places and animals are very nice too. I strongly recommend this book
B000U1ZV3U|5.0|Nice version of the Wyatt Earp story. Kevin Costner is convincing as wyatt Earp and the supporting cast isn't bad either. I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome. You can get different cars, and different settings. You can upgrade your car and the best part is its free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will love it.
B0024FAG5I|5.0|Loved it. A lot of action and I love westerns. Gene Hackman plays an awesome villain and there were plenty of stars in this film.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A fabulous book, I am currently watching the shows on television and now reading the book I can see the pictures in my head whilst I read.  A great book for those who in particular love the era.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|This movie, produced by zest even Spielberg, was okay. Certainly not his best. I liked the acting in it by the kids. Not sure if I would call this a \\"kids movie\\" considering some of the violence.  I'm glad I watched it but wouldn't care to see it again. Not sure I would even recommend it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I hate watching feel good movies. I hate it. My 9 year old had been nagging me to watch this so I finally gave in with a very bad attitude. I had little intention of paying attention or caring. I was so wrong!<br /><br />I cried most of this movie, despite trying to ignore watching it. It was so touching and well done. I honestly did not buy Sandra Bullock playing a redneck when I saw the previews, but when I watched it I quickly realized she was the perfect person for the part. She was so believable in this role, probably one of the only believable roles she's ever played in my opinion.<br /><br />This true story just touches your heart, and the cast all did such a wonderful job portraying their real-life counterparts.<br /><br />Despite my hatred for all things sappy, I have no choice but to give this movie 5 stars because it was just that good.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is without a doubt the best movie of this genre that I have ever seen.  It's meant to entertain and delivers that on just about every level.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a very good book all though some parts are obvious I would recommend this book to young adults
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The good wife is a very addicting show. It hooks you from the first episode and never gets boring! I highly recommend it!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really like it. It is a great book. I love it! It is a amazing book. You should read it.
B001BQDP90|5.0|The movie came in record speed.  Great quality and I also like the fact that you put your guarantee on the cover of the DVD package ensuring a great product and to contact you with any concerns or issues.<br /><br />Keep up the good work, thanks again!
193700788X|5.0|This was a great book - read it in a day.  Reading the last few Sookie Stackhouse books gave me the impression that Sookie was tired - tired of all the blood, gore and evil surrounding her. I never liked her with Eric and what he did to her in the end was totally in character and not surprising. While I was not sure how it should have ended, I feel the book ended as well as it could.
0425263924|4.0|This book was written as a bridge to keep the story of Gideon and Eva going.  No real substance for such a hot couple.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did but it was quite entertaining.  Lots of action, fast cars, bullets and a super villain.  What's not to like?
034547581X|5.0|I've read a couple of hundred books on Vietnam and have published one of my own, and I would place \\"We Were Soldiers Once . . . \\" in the top five ever written about the war. If you are new to the genre, do yourself a favor and buy this remarkable book. It will be the one against which you measure all others.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I like Amazon's house branded products, but in this case the cable is THE best micro-USB cable I've used.  The ends are rubberized plastic, quality yet not huge. The cable is soft and durable, but again, not too bulky. It winds well for storage and doesn't kink. I couldn't imagine a better quality cable. I wish I could get this quality on all cables that Amazon produces and sells under its house brand.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this version of the game.  The best part is that you can just touch on the card you want to move, and it moves without having to drag it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. Kept her occupied for a while.  Just wish she could play the whole thing. Games like these should b free. Oh well,see if we can find another one anywhere else.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|very addictive. my son and I worked hard to beat the levels. we liked the fact that there were additional allies to play with versus the first svz.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The crossfire books are all great! Similar to 50 Shades, with a twist. Entwined with you reveals a deeper trusting relationship between these two characters--- I recommend this and other crossfire books to anyone who thinks they can't trust. Great story; could not put it down. Can't wait for the next chapter!
B005I4JG80|4.0|I read this with my wife after our first son was born. The author draws personal experience and dives deep into the history of parenting philosophy across several key topics<br /><br />- the marriage<br />- daycare<br />- child behavior<br /><br />Pamela Druckerman clearly lays out and contrasts European and Anglo parenting styles giving the reader plenty of resources to think through on their journey as a new parent. French culture and institutions play a strong roll in supporting parents, placing the child as a part of the family. Much of the book discusses the child as the center or focus in a US family and that subtlety plays out in a number of areas in parenting.<br /><br />I don't plan to abandon all instincts I've gained growing up in the US. I do see the value of helping my son see him self as a part, not the whole, of our family
1582701709|3.0|The books were purchased for my sister-in-law.  She gave my a copy and I didn't seem to understand what I was reading.  Oh well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|How can you not like this game. Honestly people! Buy the game it's worth it. Trust me please. I promise
B005FMZX9Q|2.0|I can't read numbers  white hands  white backgrounds  don't mix  I would like to trade it for a watch face I can read.
B000002KB8|5.0|Had this on record cassette and now CD. The album that started it all. If we would just listen to Ozzy and less to the numbnuts that run music nowadays the world would be a lot less plastic then it has become. Still holds up 5 decades later.
B0074QGGK6|2.0|I was disappointed in this book.  It is very short and not much more than a collection of simple T-shirt or bumper sticker slogans with little real value.  I finished reading the book in less than an hour and do not think it is worth the $9 price I paid for it.  The author takes his own advice and offers nothing new of his own making.  Each of his slogans is fleshed out with nothing more than a quote or two from others and an occasional less than inspiring anecdote about his own successes and failures.  It is illustrated with very poorly drawn cartoonish pictures that add no value to the content of the book.  I would not recommend this book to any of my artistic friends.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|First ten albums, not screwed up with a louder remaster. Had the ZZ Top six pack and lost it in a house fire. Saw them in concert for like the tenth time about six months ago and what you got to love about these guys is it didn't go to there head. I still feel like I could walk into a tavern and see them drinking a beer. When you want to see what's best about America don't look at Washington D.C. look at Texas.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Once I finally got into the book, I didn't want to put it down. I saw the movie first, so I enjoyed everything in the book that the movie did not include. Can't wait to read the sequels!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Black Sabbath who started it all comes back to save the day. Even though you are hard-pressed to find metal without satellite the throngs of metal lovers who are still alive wielded Excalibur one more time and helped their old champions hit the charts at number one. Take that  Little Wayne and Little John. Your music is a little ridiculous. Record Executives can bite the big one on this one. Nice career move Bill Ward, kind of the Brian Jones of metal.
B009APMNB0|1.0|Would not install on new Dell i7 computer, took 5 tries.  When it did work, the calibration was so off it was laughable.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I have been enthralled with this series every sense it came out. great acting and history. love Maggie smith and the kitchen staff
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Better than the other dotp games. Get this version over Google play as bugs aren't in this version.<br />A must have for any mtg player.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Nice to have all three Godfather movies in house to watch whenever I want to.  The price was an &#34;offer I couldn't refuse&#34;.
B00CRMWMZ0|1.0|Not sure why I bought it since I didn't like the 30 second preview, but this is terrible.  Reminds me of King Crimson or something.  Prog rock crap, and then the same boring funk guitar for like half of them.  OOh Auto tune!  Creative.  That Carl Sagan auto tune is better.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|nOT A GREAT MOVIE I EXPECTER A LOT BETTER ACTING FROM HIM. tHE MOVIE WAS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just what I look for in a summer read. This book has it all! The characters come to life and transport you into theirs. It's an emotional, sexy, secret, mysterious, fun series. Can't wait for the next book!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Honestly a great comedy for all ages. My wife and I (both 25) greatly enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a funny and fresh animated comedy.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie. It is an attention getter that everyone that likes action movies should enjoy. It it a most see movie.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Great casting, great acting, unexpected twist and end. I recommend it.  Very, very good. Difficult to foresee the twist of the movie.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I read The Kite Runner and saw the movie, so I was excited to read this book.  I enjoyed the first portion of the book until Pari's life is turned upside down and then everything just goes down hill from there.  It was even sadder to see her as a old woman with heath problems and knowing she lead a fractured life.  So much sadness in so many lives that it left me depressed.  I'm actually not sure why I finished reading the book...
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Often I find myself a bit let down with a Hero Movie.  There might be weak story lines or not enough action with too much romance.  It is all too easy for Hollywood and its executive producers to rely on the icon over the production, that a piece stands on name alone (For example: Superman or Batman).  However, this was a fun frolic from beginning to end - albeit Robert Downey Jr's arrogance with women is a bit sickening in his initial scenes with Gwyneth Paltrow.
0060853972|5.0|I have just started reading the book but  I love it so far. Really Funny and I will be getting more by these authors.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Underrated and under seen.  Tom Cruise really surprised me in this one.  He knocked it out of the park and the story line is amazing!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Some very interesting thinking here.  This diet was suggested to me and my husband by my acupuncturist, not only for weight loss, but to see if fasting would activate my &#34;repair and protect&#34; mechanisms to help with some health issues I've been having.  The weight loss happened pretty easily.  In fact, my husband and I often look forward to our &#34;fast&#34; days.  Jury is still out on whether this approach is helping with my health issues.  However, I do sometimes feel better on my &#34;fast&#34; days, so there may be something happening there.  The book is easy to read and the diet is easy to put into effect.  Also, there is more info on the website, which is a nice supplement to the book.  If I can stick to this plan and if I continue to see results, I will definitely recommend it to friends and family.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use my Kindle Fire HD a lot with many battery draining functions like bright screen all the time and audio immersion reading because of reading disabilities. This program gives me detailed information important always having a charged Kindle. I am grateful so I showed my gratitude and my vote by purchasing the pro version.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Likes: Can download without having to start the video first, can download videos that aren't viewable on mobile and can set number of simultaneous downloads for your queue.<br />Dislikes: Can be a bit of a memory hog.
1451695195|4.0|It was just another interesting take on heaven - I'm firmly rooted in my own beliefs, but like to read other's opinions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game. Easy to follow. And navigate just hard enough to keep you going. Loved the way it was just out of the think box. Hope to see more levels. Two thumbs up
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I'm not really sure what this is supposed to do, but it is fun to play with. It allows you to create interesting patterns with beautiful depth and color. As a bonus you can save and even share the creations. Makes nice wallpaper.
B0094K1K42|1.0|This movie is depressing and slow and never brings anything together. Whomever decided it should be listed as a comedy probably should seek the help of a good therapist.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best mobile game I've played. I just wish it wasn't such a quick game. I am hoping they add more levels or make more like this.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This was one of the best Les Miserables i have ever seen. If you miss this one you have really missed something wonderful!!!!!!
B001H1SVO8|4.0|Nice movie. Worth watching. I don't wanna give any negative feedback because no movie is perfect. Now, if you enjoy suspense, this  movie has a good deal in it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I enjoy this game with my teenage kids.  Easy to play and set up.  My oldest always seems to win.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Had a hard time getting back into it after so long but once I did I enjoyed it. It ended exactly how I thought it would.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love this story and have passed it around for my  family to watch; beautiful story, a tear jerker for sure, but very enjoyable.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|So fun...I figured out how to control where the coins move...the only thing is that it's just for fun....but I guess that's good...level up!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|VERY fun game, but would like to be able to actually pick the genes on DNA to mutate as opposed to just picking a mutation
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was amazing. Though the writing is simple (and even, at certain points a bit disorienting and vague), the story and characters are real winners. You find yourself cheering in a section you never knew you could be in. I found myself travelling the gamut of human emotion, from laughing to crying myself to sleep over it one night. Definitely worth the read.<br /><br />Even better when you have someone to discuss it with - this book is great for book clubs! Mine devoured it.
B005LAII62|3.0|Not in very good shape, as I had hoped for, but my grandkids like it. I bought this for them.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.<br />Beautifully written, hilariously funny, wonderful ending.<br />A perfect read. I encourage everyone to read it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a free app. I am a novelist and I use Evernote on my Kindle AND my laptop AND my desktop. I use it for novel outlines and fleshing out my chapters just before I sit down use Word to write the complete books.<br /><br />I don't know why there are 1 star reviews. None of what they say is true, not for me. And I use Evernote a LOT.<br /><br />So far as privacy, I don't see how it invades...because it doesn't have access to any of my information except an email I use solely for signing up for things so my main email gets no junk.<br /><br />The only thing this app lacks is advanced formating. Something that isn't a must.
1468179993|4.0|I've read many books on delivering a &#34;good presentation&#34; but the author has truly succeeded in this readable and entertaining book. And the best part is that you can go to the TED website and observe the evidence! I'm a better consultant, and a better educator after implementing the recommendations in this book.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Grew up watching Goonies.  Watching it reminded me of being a kid again.  Still enjoyed it.  Brings back the days of story rather than CGI.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Please tell me this not the end.  I believe I need more. There are too many loose ends. The Dragon's need to come back.
B00011KHTM|5.0|I bought this for presentations on my Mac and it has worked wonderfully...for a great price! I've used it quite a few times.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|A quirky family story (about a sexually restless couple and their misunderstood teenagers) set against a national bioterrorism threat?  Sold.  Sameer Ketkar's wholly original genre mishmash \\"Bodies: Staged Fright\\" succeeds as both an exciting detective story and a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the contemporary American family.  Ketkar expertly and seamlessly weaves the Callahan clan's unique eccentricities into a disturbing mystery, keeping all of his conflicts simultaneously moving at breakneck speed.  Each chapter ends on just the right note, making it impossible just to \\"stop there.\\"  A good start to a promising series.  I look forward to book #2.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Brought tears to my eyes. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a book packed with romance, friendship, and grief.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. Has a nice little twist and kept me entertained the entire time. The group I watched the movie with enjoyed it too!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Have used this app for months, but the new rendition is cluttered by pics that make it hard to read, an ad space that is annoying, and an interface that is less user friendly. I'm deleting this app and going to Accuweather.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I have tried to install this app nearly a dozen different. times for my 2 year old and it always freezes. lame. she would love to play with Nemo but she is always  disappointed went it doesn't install...and so am I.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really liked it. It was really fantastical and unbelievable but it did this as if it were totally normal and i really liked that
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|It's real, raunchy, & funny; a watchable & entertaining movie, that doesn't happen often these days.  The casting is perfect, Steve is just funny without trying hard, Ryan & Emma are very charming, and Marisa & Julianne are cream of the crop actresses, what more could you ask for.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book has so many twists and turns! It's a book that gets you off your seat and gasping through out the whole book. This book is truly nothing like I've ever read in my life!! I love how this book is only a small part to a HUGE story!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Captivating game! Completely worth the 2 bucks for me; wish it was longer though! But I guess it's part of the charm- a little suspense and mystery :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game ever. Minecraft has over ten thousand people that bought the game. I'm one of them. TEAM MOJANG FTW!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Lots of fun and educational too!<br />Keeps you busy for a long time and it is very soothing to watch the fish swim and the reef grow.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really really like it!!! you'll love it and i like how you can. be on mutilple pages at one time. all you do  is a simple swipe. you'll love it!
0307887448|5.0|The book came within a few days.  It was a really quick read and interesting take on the future.  I recommend it!
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I love Kanye West to the fullest and everyone talked bad about this CD but I like it. If you actually listen to the words and not the awful beats he's speaking some real s***!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|My colleagues have always told me I'm an extrovert. Susan Cain's book helps me explain why that's incorrect, and why the truth is important. Fascinating, readable, and useful. What more could you ask?
034580404X|2.0|Not such a great read - very repetitive - no real storyline - the lip biting thing was used to many times it realy became boring and the Mr steel thing just used to often.  I did not really like these books
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved this book. The whole series was excellent. I can't explain how much I enjoyed this trilogy. Thank you James Dashner for writing them. These books kept me so hooked. Once I started it I didn't put it down until I finished it. There is so much action. POSSIBLE SPOILER- I wish more of the characters would have survived though. A lot of good ones died off.- Please write more books!
0307454568|5.0|Fantastic read was spellbound to the end.  Love the characthers and how the were portrayed.  Very real and brought everything to life.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am loving this series.  Huge sweeping landscapes and deep complicated characters. Every chapter told from the point of view of a different character keeping the story fresh and fast despite its length.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Not enough information on how to play . A little hand to understand. Don't care for it. How much more can I say to get sixteen words<br /><br />Shirleysiler
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Worked fine on my Kindle Fire but no directions. Can't get past level 6 and starts<br />the level over if I exit. Will delete but wish it was better so I wouldn't have to.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|THIS GAME SUCKS SO BAD!!! I got all the way to 30x and they took it away, they took my coins, characters, boards and everything else.  I also bought some coins with real money and all they did was take the$50+ from my account.... The company was ignorant in the way they communicated and very sarcastic.  This game is horrible!!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Its fun! I've always loved playing Bingo! It's a bit fast thou.<br />Is there a way to slow it down?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't believe what they did for minecraft,and a way to change skins you have to get block launcher pro and go on web and type (google,yahoo,etc.) Minecraft skins. And then go to any web (what i use is skindex) and download the skin(s) that you want,then go to block launcher pro then you'll see a tool on top and tap on it and go and tap on change skin and go down to downloads and tap on it then tap on the the skin that you downloaded.  .<br />  .  )
1603427244|2.0|This is a disappointing guide. I have found a number of the descriptions impossible to follow, even though I'm an experienced knitter. I've used it for looking up the characteristics of different options and then finding instructions online, but I can't recommend this book as a step-by-step guide.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I play other TL games, this one is fun. Nice graphics, I love hatching the dragons. After a while, I get a little bored and neglect it for a few days.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I don't know what I did wrong but I couldn't get out of level 3.  After many frustrating attempts, I decided to uninstall the game.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Finally a better than decent photo app for my kindle fire!! Lots of options and easy to use and store or upload photos.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie is one of Liam Neeson's best.  There was action all throughout and he was convincing as a super spy out to rescue his kidnapped daughter.  I watched it again with my husband and the tension held him captive.  He was very impressed with the movie.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Update: I have this app on my kindle, phones, everything possible. I love that I can hide certain files, have a recycle bin, and more. Hands down a top 10 app must have.<br /><br />I use this to easily find my downloads, pdf files, pictures etc. Makes finding my docs on my kindle fire much easier. Takes a little patience to figure it out, but overall it's a must have utility.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|None of the levels were very difficult except for the last one. Most were quite obvious. They could have been a lot more challenging.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|I've always wondered how people create these keep calm things. Now I know. This app would've gotten five stars if the people who made this could make it so your able to change the font color. Other then that, this app rocks!! It's worth the 99 cents
1781162646|4.0|The book was good, but I've come to expect more from Stephen King. I know writers need to grow and change, but his son is about to run circles around him.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Band is great really love their songs very easy download to. Very good cost and very catchy songs. A must get.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Its great on the kindle or on facebook. So fun and you get<br /> to play for free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an addictive app, plus the graphics are awesome, and on top of that - it's free.  Why should you not download this game?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was fun but I ran through it too quickly. I wish there would have been more picture puzzles and hidden objects.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|The premise was very interesting and plausible. The execution was, in my opinion, perfect until Pinbacker appeared on the station. I do realize it's silly to fault an artist's writing--as the work was written as its writer desired it. For some reason, though, that is where I became less engaged with the story. With that said, I still very much enjoyed the film and did like the story overall.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Classic song.  Bought it so i could learn to play  it on the guitar.  Easy to download, great sound!  Thanks!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Great old Cary Grant movie! Yes, it's dated now, but the excitement of the chase is still there and so is the music and the Hitchcock suspense edge. I never really tire of watching this one.
0425263924|4.0|I thinking the book needs more information about Cross and Eva. But, I enjoyed the book, and whish the new book came faster, than this!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This movie has a perfect ballance of action, romance, and comedy. It is not a traditional zombie movie. The quirky play on the traditional plot was unique and fun. It is not a guy movie or a gal movie. It was a great movie for everyone.
0689835604|5.0|I love this book!  It's super adorable.  The flaps on the inside make it more interesting and it really teaches your child &#34;behind, under, etc&#34;.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|arrived on time and works perfect. the movie I will not rate since that's art... a matter of opinion. its a Depp movie which I'm fond of the style
B0093FNZT6|5.0|This book is not about religion or religious belief. It is a very eloquent description by a person whose qualifications cannot be challenged -- he is a highly qualified practicing neurosurgeon, and there is abundant proof he was clinically \\"dead\\" for a week.<br /><br />He has written about what happened to him in that week, where his consciousness was, and how remarkable it is that he has almost 100% recollection of everything  he experienced in that time away from what we know as life on earth. I believe what he was written, and I think it would be foolish to debunk him as some sort of attention seeker.<br /><br />I liked the paperback so much I've downloaded it to my Kindle, and have re-read it several times. The style of the book is interesting: one chapter tells you what Dr Alexander was experiencing, and the next  covers reports from his family and professional colleagues about what they  were doing and observing. When I re-read it, I skip the chapters of what was happening at his home and in the hospital, and read the alternate chapters describing the voyage made by his soul or spirit or consciousness or whatever you like to call it.<br /><br />This is an impressive and honest book  which has affected my thinking deeply.
014241722X|5.0|I purchased this for my 8 year old grandson.  He loves the books by John Grisham.  Theodore Boone reminds me of my grandson, so we both enjoy reading about his adventures.  Good Book!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is so much fun. Gotta try this...the game is adjustable so it is fun for the novice and the experienced...just try it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Awful. Two main characters were a cheating husband and a pathological liar. Then they had a child. Best to skip.
B00COQU0D0|3.0|I only got it for the era music theme, it's alright. Only 2 good songs on here, lana del rey's and fergie's.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|grate game I like it a lot deft worth a try I mean its free so why not. its a win win deal
B0002KPIQY|5.0|The unrated version far surpassed the original version, it is simply amazing, all the directors decision are on this one w/o being cut out for &#34;appropriateness&#34; ---Get it, you'll love it.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I'd give it another 1/2 star if I could.  I really enjoyed this.  Every character had their moment to shine, the dialog was quick and witty - all around it was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed Loki as the villian, Black Widow actually had a purpose (as opposed to simply cutting a nice figure in a catsuit), the special effects were quite good, and Coulson stole the show.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|All my friends were talking about it, but it was my son that got me hooked. He's quiet the expert on GOT. Will be looking for season 2 soon
1401235425|5.0|the new 52 continues to impress me with its Batman stories, and this one is a fast paced thriller.  fantastic artwork, can't wait to reach Volume 2!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Different pace than Ended`s Game. But, good nonetheless. The story is a natural progression from where the previous left off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game. great graphics, realistic horses. its fun to interact with the horse and train it. its a great game especialaly because its free!
B009HUB40Y|2.0|It was fun to begin with but  when you have to buy coins  to proceed to another game I didn't like that part.
B006PTL1QM|1.0|I loved Kiera Knightley in Pride and Prejudice, but her acting in this film was so overwrought that it spoiled the whole movie for me.  It's a shame, because the other actors were quite good.
B000002IR9|5.0|I listened to this album on vinyl for years.  I was very excited to finally see it on cd.  The music is just as great as I remembered it, Otis and Carla are electric together.  You will be walking around singing the songs to yourself all day.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I really didn't enjoy this novel, especially compared to his earlier work.  It feels like a set of short stories more than anything else.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|This is a fun and simple game for kids and adults to play. We liked that you can play solo or with others. I enjoy it as well as my 5 year old and with different boards and difficulty levels it can keep our interest. Good time waster.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My friend said that there was a update o Apple devices but not on Kindle so I looked up Jetpack joyride and there wasn't a update on the Kindle.
B003XVYLDU|2.0|I kept waiting for it go from boring and slow to tieing it all together and at least having a satisfying conclusion but it never happened. Guess its just not my cup of tea, it just sort of died. So it goes.
030746363X|4.0|I purchased this book for the weight loss section predominantly and it was well worth it!  I have lost over 40lb now by following the Slow Carb Diet.  It's as simple or as complex as you want to make it: Tim has structured the book so you can add on additional components, depending how \\"hard core\\" you are.  I have scanned other sections of the book, but they weren't for me.  I recommend this book and the diet featured within if you've tried everything else and you're sick of starving yourself!
B000I9YWDO|3.0|The ramdomness was great. So very much lile where i work. Went on a bit long tho.  All in all very much worth watching.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|If the new Weather Channel so does not improve will delete it from my kindle. Not as much weather info and too many taps to get to what there is. Old ap was my favorite for weather.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a fun spider solitaire app! It has the one suit or two suit options should you decide you want a challenge. I've thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Tough subject for Hollywood, taking the technical details of the actual raid and how each person may feel about interrogation it was well done.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Still great after all these years.  I remember seeing this when it first came out.  It took my breath away with the special effects and the story was involving.  Anyone who loves Sci-fi will love these movies.
B004SIP8OI|4.0|He kill bill series in my opinion is Quentin Tarantino at his best. The action was groundbreaking. The way it was filmed really made the action scenes feel like you were there watching it all happen. Recommend this to all Tarantino fans.!!
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I saw this when it was first in the movie houses.  I loved it then and still do.<br />All the singers are superb and the staging, to me, is about as good as we can get at the present time.<br />If you love Wagner, this is a must recording.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|still processing the richness of this movie. This picture of a man who built the nowadays American culture is fascinating
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It seemed like the author ran out of steam and just decided to wrap up the book quickly at the end. It's not that you're necessarily looking for 'happy ever after'. It just seemed abrupt.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|I was excited to see this movie but somewhat disappointed after I watched it.  I thought the visual effects were the best part, otherwise the plot seemed disjointed and I felt there was no chemistry between Jack and the Princess which was the focal point of the movie.  I give it 2 stars.
B008AITJ24|5.0|Great show, awesome character development and good plot, usually. Booth and Bones finally hook up and semi-settle down. If you like Bones, get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great..love this app. Challenging and entertaining. Would recommend to all. Great way to spend some time while also exercising your mind.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I am a long time Sudoku player. This version takes a little time to figure out but the layout and games are great
B007REV4YI|3.0|This installment of the Bond 007 franchise was updated to reflect the current atmosphere of \\"cyberterrorism\\" that could easily take place given the global climate and reliance on computers for nearly everything.<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie, Bond is after an assassin/agent who managed to somehow procure a sensitive list of undercover agents. Mr. Silva, the main villian and former MI6 agent, begins releasing the names of the agents publicly, causing a huge uproar against M and the spy world in general. The only way to stop more names from being released is to take out Silva. To make matters worse, Silva has a vendetta against M for jettisoning him during a mission where he basically went rogue. Feelings were hurt and he has held a grudge ever since.<br /><br />Overall critique- To me, the beginning 12 minutes were the best in the entire film. Chase sequences are notoriously difficult to pull off as you can have a lot going on in a very short span of time. Skyfall did a nice job of keeping up with the action without losing the viewer. Having said that, I was not a fan of the tower/skyscaper fight. Entirely too dark for my liking. I've read a few other reviewers mentioning the play on shadows and light, but when you basically can't see the action or tell what's going on, you probably need to rethink the scene. The final battle scene at Skyfall was rather exciting, although it seemed extremely farfetched. I know, I know, it's Bond, everything is farfetched on some level. But when the helicopter flew up to the house, I was waiting for Silva or one of his henchmen to pull out an RPG and take out the entire structure. It would have changed the entire dynamic of the scene.<br /><br />Silva- To me, this was the biggest disappointment in the movie. I expect my villains to be extremely evil, to the point of where you cringe simply thinking about them. Silva was almost the exact opposite, which might be partly due to his use of cyberterrorism rather than other weapons. Examples of his \\"kindness\\", if you want to call it that:<br /><br />1. He took over an entire island by sending out warnings that there was a chemical leak, allowing the residents to flee. Most of the bond villains from the past would have simply caused a chemical leak, along with a large body count.<br />2. He let the groundskeeper live, when he easily could have shot him.<br />3. Despite his hatred for her, he couldn't take out M when he had the chance.<br /><br />I had a problem with Bond/M/Silva church scene, in that M could have pulled the trigger, thus killing herself and Silva, and the outcome would have been almost the same. It would have played on James' psyche, but **spoiler** M and Silva would be dead, with the groundskeeper and James walking away from the firefight.<br /><br />Q- This was a disappointment and a half. Part of the intrigue of Bond has always been the cool gadgetry he receives from Q. Making it into a Q branch does seem somewhat more believable, but they didn't supply Bond was much at all. Boo!<br /><br />Moneypenny- Nice touch introducing her early in the film and cluing viewers in at the very end. I realized a few seconds early that the character seemed like a moneypenny type character and then the dialogue confirmed my suspicions. Good job, Skyfall!<br /><br />Sadly, I'm no sure I'd want to watch this movie again. I've watched all the Bonds at least once (as hard as that may be), Casino Royale more than I care to admit, and Quantum of Solace 2 or 3 times. Maybe after a second viewing I will feel differently, but really this seemed a little disappointing. I'm sure the bankruptcy of MGM in the middle of production didn't help matters any.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is addictive to say the least. It's easy enough to be fun but challenging enough to keep you interested.
B005ILYW1E|3.0|Ordered this with the Amazon $0.99 special.<br /><br />Statham: Pretty much the same in every movie, which is why I rented it.<br /><br />Paddy Constantine: The gay cop. Not sure why gayness was even mentioned. Likable guy. I figured since the synopsis included the gay issue it would be an annoying part of the storyline, dwelling on it too much. However, it's not really a significant part of the movie.<br /><br />Aiden Gillen: The villain. Someone you can easily hate.<br /><br />Story: Cops after a cop killer. Also, a side story that really didn't seem to fit but did not detract from the movie.<br /><br />Ending: I liked it.<br /><br />Overall, pleasantly surprised by this movie and the ending. Well worth one buck, especially if you like Statham movies.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Disney at its best, and in 3D.  My family and I loved it, and will love it over and over again.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Watching the roles of the female characters evolve is fascinating, as well as the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement.  I'm hooked!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this game but it needed more than 10 to start you off with, they need to update rlthe game so more levels will be available
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|as always Mr. Brown brought a great story line to life! enjoyed reading this and looking for new one to read!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|The book- which is usually the case - is better than the movie. The acting was really good, though. Not sure if I would see it again
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|I had seen the trailer for this movie quite a few times, but it never really appealed to me and no one else had really much to say about it, which is why I waited to rent it. I found the movie pretty good overall, but lacked that little something that would've made it a way better movie. The story was interesting and it definitely not slow with the story/action, but it seemed like you kind of knew how the plot was going to play out the whole time. Definitely an interesting twist, but I hate to say it...there could've been a little more drama focused on the issue Mark Wahlberg's character was dealing with, because the ending seemed a little lack luster. Overall, good acting and story, but not one I would rewatch or buy for my collection.
034580404X|5.0|I really liked reading this book. The book is not as domineering as they make it out to be. It is a love story with a little bit of dominatrix in it.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I definitely had a preconceived notiion about what this movie was about, but from the vary start, it grabbed my attention. The movie was more about the aftermath of a plane crash and the pilot who miraculously saved almost everyone on board...plus, substance abuse. Quite enjoyable for adults, but wouldn't recommend for anyone under 17.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. The kids love to help solve the word puzzles too.so I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great series on HBO.  Can't wait for season 3 on DVD.  I believe this winter there will be a Games of Thrones weekend at my house.  Great plot, action and intrigue.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I think many people will like this series, it has suspense, cliff hangers and great details. I highly recommend this book. You want be eating money. Hope you like the book. Enjoy. -Bell
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Biblically accurate and vivid portrayal of the Passion. It really makes you grateful for Jesus' sacrifice.
034580404X|5.0|She loved it she thought it was a normal book until she read it there sex life have been very good
B003DZX44I|5.0|This is truly a princess movie! I love this growing up, and they did not change it! My girls love it too.
B00001SIES|4.0|I laughed when I heard this CD.  I had read the reviews comparing the vocals to Freddie Mercury and Jeff Buckley. Muse is a very tight band, but they could use a great lead singer.  The singer doesn't have a lot of vocal quality or range.  The timbre of the voice is not distinctive and he breaks into falsetto because he can't reach the notes, full voice.  I've listened to later Muse CD's and he does improve a little, but he'll never be a great rock singer like Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant or Chris Cornell.  He's the weakest link in the band.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Of course this is a wonderful movie! Classic story, and just like I remember from my childhood! We love it!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The blending of the working class and elite is amazing. It truly  shows how the two worlds come together, all be it a slow process.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and grown ups. It has a great plot line, and it's not preachy, just fun!!
0425263924|5.0|I won't spoil the ending, however, the series isn't ending.  Even the author makes a note that it's not over.
B003XKPPOU|3.0|My kids like this movie, but I thought it was not that great. Toy Story 1 & 2 were much better, this is just a bad spin-off of a great original.
0425263916|5.0|I loved this book and can't to finish the next one!! The series is great so far! I hope to read more books by Syliva Day.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I had read some reviews on Amazon before buying this that said kids were scared. It was not any scarier than any other kid's movie. It taught a good lesson about what's important in life, and finding balance. Unfortunately there is evil in the world, but I thought this movie did a good job addressing that in a kid friendly way. This is one of the better movies Disney has put out lately.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is the BEST.  I have watched each season on Amazon Prime Video (without commercials).  I can't wait for the next season to start!
B004G6009U|5.0|The songs are catchy and not annoying. True to Disney princesses (happy endings) this ranks as one of my girls' favorites.
159463176X|3.0|I began reading excitedly as I have become a great admirer of Hosseini after reading his first two books.  Later, as I browsed through some of the reviews written by other readers, I wasn't surprised to find that they too found it dragging towards the end.  For one, there's this endless, rambling analysis of every feeling, every reaction by the various characters compounding its tediousness by the forced addition of some parts- for example the detailed account of Dr. Markos's life in Tinos, Greece.  I didn't get the purpose behind the variety of points of views either; it gets confusing.  The reader is trying hard to detect the thread that connects the various narrations- at best it's a bold experiment on the author's part.  The initial chapters including the letter by Nabi reveal the flashes of brilliance characteristic of Hosseini.  I have been putting off reading the very end itself since yesterday- it just fizzles out rather than building into a climax which one expects of a story that began so well.  Hosseini digresses, rambles and leaves the reader thirsty.  It needed effective editing!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I have to watch these two movies around Christmas time.  Otherwise, it wouldn't feel like Christmas.  Merry Christmas to Me.
1455526959|5.0|As always, the Harry Bosch series of books that Michael Connelly writes are fantastic.  This one was right up there with the rest of the series.  Absolutely enjoyed it and look forward to another Harry Bosch book.  I truly would hate for this series to end.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Very relatable for some teens. I Want this for my classroom. I Will definitely be checking out his other stuff.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The surprise ending of the last episode was very sad. I think it could have waited until the beginning of season 4. A bummer.
B0069JBKHI|3.0|First off, this thing will not work over wifi. I had to hardwire this to my network to get any use out of it. I also have trouble accessing the video feed with my phone. You'd think that this alone would be enough to make me return the monitor but the fact of the matter is that it works great at home or when connected to wifi remotely.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Family members can access video feed<br />Humidity readout helps bring comfort to baby when sick<br />Night vision works well and it's light varies in intensity depending if in use which is comforting as IR is harmful to the eyes<br />Works great at home<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wireless mode isn't consistent<br />Trouble access feed from phone network<br />Lag<br /><br />I find the audio and nightlight feature useless because I own another device that does this better, but I can see how someone looking for an all-in-one solution would utilize it.

B005FOLIZ2|4.0|I have only watched the first season, but would say it's definitely not a waste of time. It's not rip-roaringly funny, but it's absolutely entertaining, and the main character is incredibly relatable. The acting is much better than is often the case in a first season. It is, in the vein of The Office, often almost difficult to watch sometimes because of the, well, Awkward, dialogue. Other reviewers were correct in stating that the characters are definitely pretty cliched, but they seem to be building toward increasing the complexity of the secondary characters in the second season (I hope). I am looking forward to the second season.

B009AMAJVO|3.0|\\"Your trying to clean up a mess that can not be cleaned up.\\" Victor (Farrell) works for crime lord Alphonse and is one of his most trusted associates. One night his neighbor Beatrice (Rapace) finally gets up the nerve to talk to him. Victor and Beatrice go out for dinner and Victor is told of her past and plan for revenge. She wants nothing more then for Victor to help her with this problem, but Victor also has a plan of his own. I will open by once again saying the movie was OK but not at all what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be an exciting action/revenge movie in the vein of Payback. While it did have some aspects of Payback in it, like the fact that there really is no good guy, it was lacking in a lot of action. This is almost more of a crime drama then action. Victor spends the movie trying to hide his secret from everyone he meets and that gives the movie the tense feeling it was going for but it seemed to drag through most of it and I found it hard to pay attention in a few spots. Overall, not what I expected, less action then I was thinking but the movie is OK and is still worth watching once. I give it a B.

B00D2CYV9E|3.0|\\"I want to be everything to you Scott. I want to be father, brother, lover, best friend.\\" This is the true story of Scott Thorson (Damon) and his relationship with the one and only Liberace (Douglas). Scott was a normal easy going gay man with a dream to become a vet. That all changed when he met Liberace. The small town boy became a drug addicted, paranoid, and revenge obsessed man. I wasn't totally sure what to expect from this movie. I knew very little about the real Liberace and nothing about this story at all. The movie shows the rise and fall Scott and the extreme things he goes through for the man he loves. The story is pretty interesting but the real reason to watch is the performance of Michael Douglas. He is great in this and turns himself completely into the character that he makes you forget you are watching a famous actor like Michael Douglas. Overall, a pretty interesting bio-pic that I thought was pretty good but the performance by Douglas is great. I give it a B.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love the weather channel app and up until today would have given it a 5 star review, but with the new layout everything just seems like an over congested mess! This app used to be so user-friendly  and wonderful. Now I feel like it is just covered in maps and videos. I miss easy access to just forecasts the way it was before. :/
006224454X|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat almost the whole entire time. I sympathized with the protagonist and really felt her confusion and fear.
B009JZWYKQ|5.0|No cult classic can compare to From Dusk Till Dawn. It has been one of my favorite movies since it first came out. The psycho serial killer beginning leading into the climax at the bar is classic. Love Tarantino movies and this one probably started my love for his style and art. Don't miss this one.
B00466HM28|5.0|Travel size & easy use.<br /><br />I had a little problem getting it to work with logic but after that it is a charm.<br />Ease of use.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I really liked this movie. 4.5. Wish we could do half stars. A very fresh, fun take on zombies. My wife HATES zombie movies, and we enjoyed this movie together. That says a lot about it. Without getting all crazy into the details and character development and all that (lead role dude did an awesome job), I'll just say that it kept me engaged, start to finish.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Family loved it but! my 3 yr old grandchild was really freaked out and worried about the witch being real. We assured him it wasn't but he was still wasn't convinced. Probably wouldn't recommend it for 4 and under. Just my opinion.  Other then that,  a great movie. I'm glad I bought it.

B00C3MKCIS|3.0|I usually dislike panning a new band since it is so difficult to make in modern music, Sound of Contact is lacking in any originality serving up the same rehash of &#34;progressive&#34; rock artists. Simon Collins delivers almost the identical vocal style and production of his father Phil Collins of Genesis. Although the pedigree is there, the CD could be titled Genesis Reux with the same pop standard fare with a lengthy piece at the end. With the lack of strong guitar work, it is not a very exciting record. The band's only saving grace is that they have collaborated with veterans of independent prog Marillion (they hired their manager for double duty) who may show them how to deliver the goods and remain unique to their sound. If you like later Genesis you may find this a novel effort.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|My husband has already written a book which is in Amazon's archives. This book needs to be edited. It contains some great ideas that are poorly written. He is an old man who is disabled both physically and mentally. If one of your young geniuses could edit his book and produce a commercial product he would be happy to turn over half the royalties and co-authorship to the editor. He is a poor man and cannot pay you guys anything, but if you are as good as you say you you are, then half the royalties should be a win- win for all of us. His book is only about 168 pages so it should not be a daunting task for a professional. Give me a phone number and I will happily give you a call.

B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game so much I always play it with my mom  five stars this is the best game
B009UAO1ZG|2.0|I wanted some accurate history.  This was just plain FDR over and over.  The author glossed over many things FDR did and emphasized what the shortcomings of Lindberg.  He stayed way away from showing how we pushed Japan and Germany into the war.<br /><br />I would not recommend it.
B0044WSGXI|5.0|I first saw this movie in the early 70's, loved it, but haven't seen it since. Now, 40 years later it was just as good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 6 year old loves this game. I am 38 and think it is enjoyable as well. Worth the download.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|It's not as good as the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" (few films reach that mark!) but it is a thoroughly entertaining film. suitable for audiences for all ages. What makes this Blu-ray disc extra special for me is the stellar transfer which has the vivid look of three strip Technicolor, the spectacular color process that the original \\"Wizard\\" was made in. I've never seen a modern film look this close to Technicolor on any video format. If you have a new flat screen TV this would be a spectacular disc to demonstrate it and a reference disc to measure all others by. The regular DVD should be fine too but if you have a Blu-ray player and a high quality TV, definitely go for the Blu-ray. I bought the 2-D version but since I have a 3-D TV and liked it so much I'll probably spring for the 3-D version too. Highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy these types of games and so far this one is fun but on the easier side which makes for a relaxing escape.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Finally, it's over.  This one is not as bad as deadlocked but only by a tinge.  But if you've been reading TB you had to know where it ended.  Sookie and Sam - pretty obvious since the beginning.  BTW -  I hated those fairies...this was a vampire series.  What happened to the vampires after book 7- I'd like to know.  It's like they only made a guest appearance. This is a total beach read experience - no thinking involved!
B0098VXDDS|1.0|The shows would not stay loaded. It keeps stoping and loading.  Still want to watch the series but not if this keeps up.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Hungry hungry giants! Not much negotiation possible. Loved pigs in a blanket. I expect sheep would get in your teeth.
1582701709|2.0|Just wasn't what I expected.  Reading the first few pages will do it, unless you like things to be repeated.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Yep. I wasn't going to get caught up in \\"Pop Lit\\", especially not Zombies, fer cryin' out loud. But the format lured me in and I ended up REALLY enjoying this! The interviews were a fresh take on Zombie-ology. I loved the interview snippets from so many vantage points that came together to make the story. Isn't that how we get so much of our information anyway? Everything from the jerk entrepreneur who sold the fake Zombie Vaccine to the K9 soldier who murdered her CO over rescuing her partner dog--the story gives more viewpoints and situations than I'd have thought possible.<br /><br />Get it, read it--- Enjoy!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I'm a long term Supernatural fan and this season was one of the best. The last two episodes were like a movie and honestly I believe the Season 8 Finale was my favorite from all the seasons. It was visually stunning and mindfully thought provoking.

B0092S4WLY|5.0|Not too difficult yet challenging. Wish there were more floors. Each floor had a slightly different challenge. A great way to keep the mental juices working.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|its good in ways and bad in ways because I'm not always home and I leave my divice at home. so I'm not always there when it does the alarm. so.......I would recommend to get this app if you keep your tablet with you at all times so you can hear the alarm to remind you to read the Bible today:)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it.....can't wait til next season!!  Would recommend this to anyone who loves this era of time.  Love all the characters!
B007MDB71O|4.0|John Carter is a cornerstone of science fiction.  Unlike his luckier counterpart Tarzan the Lord of the Jungle, John Carter of Mars was on the brink of making it to the screen a few times in the near hundred years since his story was first published, but for some reason it never happened until this film.  (Yes, there is another adaptation, the less said about it, the better)<br /><br />First a warning, you've all seen it before.  Not because John Carter is derivative of other more \\"famous\\" works, but rather the other way round.  Because John Carter never made it to the screen or received the lavish attention of the general public, you might be forgiven for thinking that scenes were lifted from other epics such as Star Wars or Avatar.<br /><br />The story of John Carter is that of a Virginia gentleman and former captain in the Confederate Army.  After the war he sets off into Indian territory in search of gold.  Pursued and followed by the Indians he finds himself into a cave where he mysteriously finds himself transported to Barsoom, known to us as the planet Mars.  It marks the beginning of a series of wild adventures across the Red Planet and its extraordinary inhabitants.<br /><br />The film pretty much follows the story of A Princess of Mars, the first book in the series.  John Carter finds himself on Mars and is captured by the exotic-looking four-armed Green Martians lead by the formidable Tars Tarkas.  As he tries to adapt to his new situation an aerial battle unfolds overhead.  To his surprise the crews of the ships appear human.  After a daring rescue, and one must add that because the gravity on Mars is much lower than that of Earth, John Carter has the benefit of incredible strength and the ability to leap vast distances which aids quite a bit with aerial rescues.  The woman he rescues is none other than the Incomparable Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.  Together with Woola, a ten-legged Martian equivalent of a dog and Sola a female Green Martian they uncover a sinister plot that threatens the very existence of Barsoom and by extension that of Earth.<br /><br />The transition to film required a number of changes to the original backstory, though most important elements are still present in the film.  The setting and characters look properly alien.  The Green Martians are a good example of CGI used properly.  The aliens look very much alive and the effects are nearly seamless.  Taylor Kitsch's John Carter is a darker figure than the original literary character who was too much of the Errol Flynn mould for our modern jaded tastes.  One of the film's major revelations is Lynn Collins who looks amazing as Dejah Thoris and makes her into a modern action heroine as opposed to the book's permanent heroine in peril.  Barsoom looks suitably majestic, the film balances action, laughs and intimate moments very well.<br /><br />The greatest mystery is why John Carter didn't do better at the box office as it is a competently made film which takes its subject seriously and honestly.  There has been some talk that Disney gave up on John Carter before release as they had just acquired the Star Wars property and felt it would compete with future film projects.<br /><br />Don't let this discourage you because John Carter is a great old-fashioned adventure tale without any of the now obligatory cynicism and deconstruction that seems to be the norm these days.  Many of its flaws result more of Hollywood-style adaptation than any failures of the source material.<br /><br />If you want to know what inspired Lucas, Cameron and Spielberg, do check out John Carter ...
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Loved his two previous books, stories,with poignancy masterfully narrated by the author. This book, according to me, was not as gripping, tending to drag on occasions. However, another interesting story of Afghanistan from the author .
B00455IVHU|4.0|Ok, it's her usual frump to vamp story, but who can resist her chasing after a nerdy but hunky Jeff Bridges?? But for me the real scene stealer is Lauren Bacall as her competitive mother.  It makes me wish she'd done more films in this decade. Waste of a great voice!
B0046B3QTG|4.0|For a children's movie I thought this was great. It has a little something for just about everybody. Even adults will find this movie great.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really love the game itself but working through Facebook there are issues with your game friends showing on friends list so you can't send gifts and trade like your supposed to. If this issue was fixed I would probably play all the time. Just frustrating not to be able to actually play with my friends.
B002NZV68U|1.0|You should only ever watch the original. This remake sucked worse than most remakes do. Johnny Depp was simply terrible, almost like a creepy Michael Jackson.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I have seen the show all the way through the latest season and even though I know everything that is coming (winter lol) it is awesome to read. There is more detail of course that adds to themes you didn't quite catch while watching the show. Not to mention it helps solidify things you saw seasons past. Great writing and thrilling narrative.

B007HU4FJ8|5.0|I would not watch this movie when looking to relax.  This movie is a great interpretation of a very historic event in the history of the world.  The bottom line is that Christ died a horrific death so that believers can be forgiven of their sins.  The movie shows how horrific that death was.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun game for people who love horses. You get to do anything u can do with.  Real horse
B00181JGI2|2.0|So many people have referenced this movie that I thought that I should probably go ahead and watch it.  Honestly, I did not like it.  I never really felt engaged throughout the entire movie.  My only thought is that maybe if I watched this movie enough that some lines would become unforgettable.  My comparison is Napoleon Dynamite.  I fell asleep the first 30 minutes into that movie, but have now seen it enough that some of the lines have worked their way into some of my movie quotes.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|not as good as the first but it was ok, ii hope the 3rd is better, left a lot for you to think about
0887306667|3.0|This book is a quick and easy read.  The information presented is very valuable.  However, the information presented was not earth shattering.  This book will definitely become one of my go to business reference books.  Working these laws into my job will be the next challenge.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This app has many different sounds and tones.  I use it for my morning meditation and enjoy the many variations I can choose depending on what I feel like at the time.  I also use it sometimes before I go to sleep. The pre-sleep tones really relaxes my mine and makes it quicker to fall asleep. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like the game however 10 levels is not enough. I can't wait for the new levels to be added. Hopefully it will have 30 or 40 more.
B007HVBW2A|4.0|I had never seen the whole movie, only parts. After watching it I can for sure say that it is a classic and worth all praise it gets.<br /><br />What happened to good horror/thriller movies? It seems now everything has either been done a million times over or is so moronic that you can't even watch it.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|It seems to keep young children amused for a while.  It is not asbinteresting to them as some games, but holds attention for a while.  Not my thing, but I am old.
B000BISBDY|5.0|As someone who loves Johnny Cash, but not enough to dedicate myself to getting all of his albums this is a damn fine compromise.<br /><br />I do wish it had &#34;Cocaine Blues&#34; though.

0545265355|4.0|This boxed set contains all three Hunger Games hardcover books.  They are all good books and I feel a I paid a decent price for the selection. The last book did depress me but it was well written.  Kudos to the authoress.

B00BXHE0CI|4.0|If this was DEP's debut album I would have given it 5 stars. The album lacks some of the emotion and passion of the other albums but still, it's everything you can expect from a DEP album and therefore 4 stars.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had a difficult time with Khaled Hosseini's latest book.  It may have been that I was reading it on my Kindle and could not easily go back to refresh my memory on previous characters.
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|I was eager to see the QUARTET. Directed by Dustin Hoffman, QUARTET stars several beloved older British actors. Maggie Smith shines in any film she graces. Add in Tom Courtney, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins and Michael Gambon, and we have a dream cast. Unfortunately, the film is uninspired and rather sad. Beecham House is a retirement home for singers and musicians and it is about to have a glorious new resident in opera sensation Jean Horton (Maggie Smith). It's not clear how this cast ended up in what seems more like an assisted living facility than a retirement home. Most residents seem to be in reasonable good health. Are there destitute and needing to live in a group home for the elderly? It seems like these acclaimed singers and musicians are now alone in the world with only each other.<br /><br />Horton arrives just in time for rehearsals for a gala event to keep their home open. Does Beecham House run on charity? Again, it is unclear as to why Beecham House is short on funds. Horton is asked to join a quartet that includes her very bitter ex-husband. Old wounds have festered through the decades. This is not a happy group of people except for eternally cheerful and confused Cecily Robson (Pauline Collins).<br /><br />Although Tom Courtenay and Billy Connolly have aged well, time does not seem to have been good to the residents. Rather than being an inspirational film about enjoy life in later years, QUARTET seems to be the story of once famous people fading into oblivion looking for one last hurrah. Ironically, in a bonus feature, someone mentions the film as a \\"comedy.\\" It seemed rather sad to me. Hopefully, others see it differently. I was disappointed in a film that has such a marvelous cast and director.<br /><br />Be sure to watch the credits. There are some bittersweet pictures of the cast members as they are in the film and as they were in their prime. Most of the cast worked in theater and were once well-known stage actors and musicians. Opera and classic music are the keys here. Beecham House is actually full of aging opera singers s there are no 70-year-old rock stars living in residence. Mick Jagger won't be moving in any time soon. I wondered how these people had fallen so far that they were now in Beecham House. Was it health or financial issues or just a chance to live with old friends in their twilight years? They do live in a lovely home on a stately English estate but had they forsaken families and friends for their careers? The setting is delightful. The residents seem happy and they do band together for the annual gala but what about the rest of the year? I left the film feeling sad, sad, sad.
B00CISC2DA|4.0|So far for me personally, this release can be distilled down to the tracks I'm willing to give repeat listens to for pleasure, and so it's really a 5 track EP with familiar filler. There are new sounds and compositions here worthy of studying and appreciating on repeat listens if you're listening for education. It starts strong, wanders into redundant, bleak loop territory, and finishes strong again. Discordant rhythms paint pictures of surreal war times or perhaps the state of a fallen personal robot industry on another planet, and I appreciate that, but it's not pleasant to listen to. &#34;Gemini&#34;, &#34;Reach For The Dead&#34;, &#34;Palace Posy&#34;, &#34;New Seeds&#34;, &#34;Come To Dust&#34; is my short playlist for this album.
B002TIOYWG|5.0|Even if you’ve read the original “Refactoring”, Ruby is original enough to find many interesting Ruby-specific approaches in this version.<br /><br />And although the purely technical and immediately practical part of the book is of course invaluable, I liked the most the closing chapter 13: “Putting it all together”. I know this is may be only me, and I don’t mind that. ;)<br /><br />Here is one of the take-away quotes:<br /><br />“Stopping is the strongest move in the refactorer’s repertoire.”
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just could NOT put it down until I solved all 10 levels.  I can't wait for more levels to be available.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I'm enjoying the album a lot. It's different I'm always looking for something different.<br />I first heard her play Mission Impossible with the Piano Guys.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Lets call this 4 and 1/2 stars. One of the best statements about how futile and pointless wars are wrapped in a very funny and original tale.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|It came in plastic and it was packaged very well.  It was brand new as far as I could tell, but it did take a little while to  get here with standard shipping but it was by no means late.  I recommend it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|A few months back, I was having issues where if I would turn my phone on silent, the alarm wouldn't ring in the morning (which ended with several missed classes and two nearly-missed exams, in other words definitely not good). I searched around a bit for a free app that might make a better alarm clock, and this is the one I stuck with. I really enjoy it since it's simple and easy to use. It also has a timer feature which is great, and if you buy the full version you also get access to a stopwatch (which would be nice for tracking my running, but instead I just set the timer for an hour and see how much time is left, not quite as accurate but still works!)<br />I can't really compare this app to a lot of other ones out there; it was one of the first ones I picked and I stuck with it. It's been working perfectly for me for at least 4 months now (yet to miss a class), it's got lots of great features (including changing how long snooze is and even shortening snooze times the more times you snooze), and best of all, it's FREE! I'm planning to keep using this app for a long time to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Love this book. It is a good book to read. Have to read the next one know. I love it.
1476734941|2.0|You can look up all of these tips online for free by googling the 5:2 diet.  No neet to purchase the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing just as good if not better than the first... i never read and i just got done buying book three!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging. Not so difficult that you'd need to Google help , but it will keep you busy for a while
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like games that make me solve a puzzle to open a door to another puzzle before I can solve the whole thing... I loved this! Wish it had 100's of levels... but I'm sure that will come soon
B00000612P|5.0|I can remember when this album first came out and how much I loved it, which tells you that I am almost up the hill.  The CD is excellent, the price and the shipping were great.  Thank you.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|With the variety of sounds, I can find the right one to help with my mood.  There are different ways to put the sounds together that also help with a variety of thing like concentration or sleep.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I can't help, but love all the movies in the Die Hard series.  There is just something about these movies that get your attention.  The CD is great, as were the price and the shipping.  Thank you.
B009LS4KM6|3.0|I just can't put my finger on what I dislike about this movie. The characters never seem to gel for me, and the filler disguised as hilarious slapstick is so glaringly obvious it's a little embarrassing. I dunno, it's just ok.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved the story.  The characters are interesting and most of the characters are really sexy.  The story is really hot!
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|After the so-so season 6, this was an amazing return to the greatness that is Dexter. I do not wish to post any spoilers so I'll just say that it was great...so yeah.
B002SRQ214|5.0|bought this to upgrade from an athlon II x2 550(?), ive always been a gamer on a budget, and this fell right into the perfect price range for what I need.    Only downside, is the stock heatsink that comes with it sounds like a wind tunnel, but what can you expect for something that is included with the price?
1451695195|5.0|I have read many books on NDEs, and yet I discovered new insights and understandings reading this account. I highly recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I downloaded this book by mistake, so I finally decided to read it. Never I would have imagine the deep message in the story. I truly enjoy the reading. Great message for humanity.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I so wanted to read this one! I even pre-ordered it.  It came out in December of 2012 and it's currently JULY of 2013.  That's how long it took me to get to it.  There is ONLY one good thing that came out of waiting and that's the audio came out in the mean time.  Can I just say that the experience of having both the audio and the eBook for this one was incredible.  I've never had that before but it was so cool.  I listened while driving and read at home.  The two synced perfectly, taking me to the exact place I had left on on the other platform.  That was so cool.  Yes, I am kinda a techy girl and those thing thrill me.<br /><br />Back to the book.  How to even start.  I LOVED THIS BOOK.  Yes, that works.  These characters are so incredible and I so enjoyed getting to know them.  They are different, ya know.  Not your average teens with common types of angst making them crazy.  No, they have some serious baggage going on.  Sky is interesting.  I will admit that she has some quirks about her that took me a while to get used to but she's strong.  She who she is and she really doesn't give a damn if you like that or not.  She's been homeschooled all her life and has finally convinced her mom to let her go to her senior year of high school (I love that premise, byw).  Things are a bit rough, though, because she seems to have an unearned reputation as a slut.  It's her reaction that I love.  She's stubborn and strong.  She says what she means and she doesn't put up with crap.  Liked that a lot.  The one thing she did that surprised me was that she believed Holder's rep when she knew her's was wrong.  Didn't take her long, but I was surprised by that.<br /><br />Holder.  Yes, my boy Holder had me pretty confused for a while.  I so loved the chemistry between these two for sure but he has secrets.  And he's expecting Sky to ask him instead of believe the things she hears.  It seems like he doesn't believe the rumors about her rep.  I like that about him.  I like that he's unexpected.  He shows up at her house because he wants to see her.  I never wanted to believe the rumors about him.  I'm so glad I felt that way.  He has some anger issues but dang if he doesn't deserve that a little bit.  He's seriously protective.  I love that about him.  I think it's because he loves so deeply.  Sky calls him intense and that's a real good way to describe him.  I totally fell for him.  I love his sense of humor too.  His silly texts are so funny.  The way he won't kiss Sky when she wants him to.  Oh he has a very good reason for that btw and damn if that wasn't the sexiest non-kiss scene I've ever read.  Gonna have to read it - trust me.<br /><br />The story in this one is crazy.  I figured out a few little things and one big thing but dang if I didn't get myself shocked at one point.  I mean like jaw drops open and the word NO coming out of my mouth.  When Sky's past is uncovered, I'm just so emotional I can't stand it.  I'm glued to the pages and so stuck that nothing is pulling me away from this book.<br /><br />It's been a really long time since I regretting not picking up a book sooner, but this is one of those times.  I so loved this book.  I could read it over and over.  I'm so glad I have the audio because it just became my new favorite comfort book.  (My comfort books are all on audio and they get listened to over and over again.)  Speaking of the audio, I really enjoyed the narrator.<br /><br />SO, if you are like me and put this one off. STOP. RIGHT. NOW. You must read this book.  It's YA with some definite sexual scenes.  It has strong language and serious issues.  BUT it's so good, so emotional, so sexy, so yummy, so Holder.  Yes I am describing this book with a boys name.  The characters come up will a NEW way to describe their feelings for each other so I'm gonna do the same.  This book is so Holder and you will love it.  Truly.unexpected.  He shows up at her house because he wants to see her.  I never wanted to believe the rumors about him.  I'm so glad I felt that way.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo was a brilliant fast-paced thriller all the way through, even without the historical context. The relatively recent history added to what was already a great movie, and yes, I'm aware that would be Hollywoodized)<br /><br />It seemed reasonable from the Iranian perspective to point out that the US installed the brutal secular dictator that the Islamic fundamentalists overthrew. Middle Eastern politics often seems to be a choice between those two unpleasant options. I already knew that, but the film reminded me of it.<br /><br />I noticed that the Farsi was sometimes subtitled and sometimes not, probably to illustrate whether an English-speaking character understood, an effective tactic. I wonder if turning on the BluRay's subtitles would have translated the rest as well. (I'm reminded of Game Of Thrones, which created a fictional foreign language for similar purposes, and that dialogue _was_ translated in the DVD subtitles)<br /><br />I figured the military personnel were Marines since the USMC typically provides security detachments for US diplomatic facilities. It seems they were simply overwhelmed by the massive numbers of the mob.<br /><br />I was amused by the sarcasm about Hollywood in the scenes relating to setting up the fake film production. I wonder if it was self-deprecating humor or rants about what the creators had to deal with when interacting with other Hollywood types.<br /><br />I noticed the media cover story was indeed necessary, to get them past the last layer of airport security.<br /><br />The changes from real life sometimes imperiled the film as a historical document, but did not hurt and sometimes even helped it as art and entertainment. I've learned from fiction adaptations that sometimes changes have to be made to maintain the story's effectiveness in a different format or account for practical production concerns.<br /><br />Many changes heightened the drama yet further, which seems reasonable. The six Americans had actually stayed in two Canadian diplomats' houses, and simplifying that seems reasonable. However, Canada's contribution to the planning was downplayed, and Britain and New Zealand were inaccurately disparaged. That's an annoying habit of American media, to downplay the contributions of even other Western countries.n two Canadian diplomats' houses, and simplifying that seems reasonable.

6303481272|5.0|Love it. Just so good to have what you want fast. Just like to thank amazon for everything. The greatest ever hand's down.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This cover is  easy to use and works great.  Quick delivery time. Definitely well worth the cost.  Not the color I would have chosen, but the one that was on sale.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love John Mayer. He is a very soulful singer. His music moves across a spectrum of genres. It's great easy listening music.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Although the story was it's own, it was a big flop.  I wasn't happy with the story at all and I think the special effects are what made this movie ok.  However, I was hoping for a deeper story line than what was given and the way it played out could have been much better.  This was definitely a one timer for me.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|Wife got this free app of the day on her kindle.... it sucks... and wasn't that great of a game but what do you expect for a free app...
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|I've been a fan of FOB for awhile. This album is great and I can't wait to see them in concert in September.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|EEEEKKKKK, Colleen Hoover has done it again.  Hopeless is one of my all time favorite books and I thought there was no way she could top it.  But boy was I wrong, I think I love Losing Hope just a smidge more!!  Dean Holder, oh how do I love thee.  You stole a little bit of my heart in Hopeless but oh in Losing Hope you stole the whole damn thing.  Losing Hope is not just Hopeless retold in Holders point of view, it is so much more.  We learn so much more about the day Hope was taken, the day Les dies and how everything unfolds through Holdens eyes.  I was a crying mess while reading this book.  The emotions that are brought out are simply amazing.  Holder is truly a special character and will forever be number 1 in my heart.  I cant even continue this review, no words I will ever write will do this book justice.  I don&iexcl;¯t want to spoil anything and yet I want to tell you everything.  All I can say is thank you Colleen Hoover, your gift with words is simply amazing.<br /><br />One Million Star review**************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />¢¾ Sophie
B008EKMB82|2.0|This was not a good book.  I couldn't make it all the way through. Too depressing.  Lots of talk of suicide.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use with iPad, Droid Bionic,  Kindle Fire  HD and Windows for lists and note taking. Clip articles and web pages from Windows-based browsers. Goodbye paper.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A quiet story about a man on a journey to see an old dear friend. He and his wife, long married and distant, come to realize how much they mean to each other. A touching story with interesting characters.
B004I744AS|5.0|this is an absolutely useful tool which I have been using for a while. I love the explanations and the examples. It has a wealth of information for every word you search!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This movie is hilarious, i don't buy any DVD's but I would consider purchasing this so I can watch it over and over. IT is a great feel good movie.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Just a great heart wrenching story of a great soldier of God.  God bless you Adam Brown.  Never take our freedom for granted.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I chose this rating because the book is well thought about and proved that it has the right effect. It is very realistic and will tell you from the beginning that there is no 'quick fix' to reach your goal. Very open and innovative. I loved it! I started to practice it and experienced the same effects that Darren is speaking about. OK, I have to say that I started with small things, jogging and paying attention to what I eat. I really feel and see the differences and people acknowledge the progress. This book is a 'MUST Have'.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play it all the time.  Nice graphics. Fun, easy movements, couldn't ask for more. Highly recommended. Great game!  Lots of fun.
B002CNK1MK|4.0|I love Dustin Hoffman in this classic movie. If you have never seen Rain Man, it is worth watching. Amazon, if you allow me to leave 10 word responses, I will review more films.

0374533652|5.0|This is a book everyone should read, and be aware of the advantages of being in the 1%.  Michael Sandel is an excellent speaker -- I took a Justice course by video and it was thought provoking and brought to light new issues and decisions in the 21st century regarding ethics in the marketplace.  This book is a part of that lecture series.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This game is really fun for the whole family- =)  I recommend this game to everyone!  The only thing wish they have better instructions and buying all the time. Yes game free but what kills us is to add things. Need neighbors add me I have four farms and play them all the time. Farms IDs FAWUFIW, DXXVRQJ, DTPQFNT, DQHQSAP. Please add me!! THAK YOU!

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Where were you during the Great Panic? That's the overall tone of this book. A collection of first-person experiences from the very whispers of what seemed sheer ridiculousness to the jaded, yet optimistic survivors trying to rebuild humanity. Reading this thoughtfully and master crafted tale not only tells vivid and very real first person “experiences\\" but the overall story of a World wide experience without spelling everything out for you. Even if you aren't a fan of the zombie genre, you will appreciate how this story is told.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book; many of my friends recommended it to me, and I loved it. My parents didn't approve of the language in the book, but other than that, it was a great tearjerker, and just a fantastic book
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best book ever! Im 10 and even I love it, the passion the emotion! One word: GENIOUS!!!!!!!!! 5 Stars!!!!! I loved the characters!! With the romantic tension between Peeta and Katniss and Gale. Marvelous bound to be classic! A must read!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Loved how the title came into play.  It was a surprising twist that left me sad and happy at the same time.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I can see why this movie won the Oscar. It mixes everything, emotionally, while telling a good bit of history we should all be aware of. The casting and performances are spot on. Watch the end segment, comparing the cast to the actual people. And listen to President Carter's section...it's a bit mind boggling.
B001EC3JME|4.0|Loved the price.  I also like that I can use it with both of my favorite flashlights which are slightly different sizes.  Only problem that I have found is that it can be difficult to unclip from the belt.
0062255657|5.0|The start of this book opens like most books. A seemingly normal person returns home for a funeral and starts looking around his old haunts. When he returns to the farm at the end of the lane...that's were it turns to anything but normal.<br /><br />This book is written for adults but I could see this being a nightmare for children. The story is constanly moving and just a bit scary even for an adult like me.<br /><br />I loved the Hempstocks who owned the farm at the end of the lane. They were so unusal. They might be those werid neighbors you have as a child who you are sure about but everyone whispers and just says the family is a bit off.<br /><br />It's such an believable story as a child. The ones we dream up and want to be true but as we grow up we see there is no way that could have possibly happened. As they say in the book. There is two sides to a story.<br />And I see this as the Child Side and the Adult Side.<br />The part we want to say was real as a child but the adult side as we grow older that makes me turn things that were so unbelievable into memories that had to be just dreams...<br /><br />This book makes me want to be a child again so I can have those \\"dreams\\"
B004SOR4H6|3.0|nothing great. okayish, not too many complaints. but generally slow and not much fun. could and should be better than now.
B009LXEBD4|3.0|Not being familiar w/K.Clarkston, I ordered for the track &#34;Baby Don't Rush&#34;. 90% of the othert tracks are not what I enjoy to listening to.

B00AM0C6YG|5.0|When I first heard Laura Mvula I instantly knew that I was in the presence of someone very special: the tune was &#34;That's alright&#34;.<br />After listening to the entire album I remained fascinated with her songwriting and sense of sonority. She displays a very personal way of combining timbres and orchestral colors: there is substance and different levels of density, as opposed to the current crop of over- productions that hide lack of real ideas behind a pseudo wall of sounds.<br />Laura's sense of harmony is also transparent but always interesting. The album's sound is astounding.<br />Sing to the Moon will remain a landmark 'opera prima'. Laura Mvula is here to stay.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I love this movie. It has the ability to take me through every emotion! It is a classic and a keeper. It's pretty much the only Nicolas Cage movie that I like.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|I just finished reading the book and it was fabulous. What a wonderful way to learn about history and I found it appealing to peer into a world war that defined a century of politics.  I has to conduct my own research on  WWII as Follett's writing engaged me in the era. It is a great read!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent puzzle ...not too difficult but not easy. Beautiful graphics. Very enjoyable. I was sorry to finish it and I can't wait for the next chapter.
B005KJ6ECY|5.0|This dramatisation embellishes what historians have written about King Henry VIII and his wives. The characters come alive in their beautiful, lavish Renaissance costumes, not entirely accurate to the Tudor period, but entirely acceptable for a rip roaring yarn, full of intrigue, passion, love, war, and which is set in  beautiful scenery. Thoroughly enjoyable.
1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olson has two claims to author fame: she is an excellent researcher and a wonderful wordsmith. Those two talents make \\"Those Angry Days\\" a delightful encounter for the reader. She has molded a compelling story of two men--two distinctively opposite personalities--into probably one of the best books of this historical and political era. Devotees of Franklin Roosevelt will see the president from a different vantage point, while those interested in Charles Lindberg also will view this \\"tragic\\" figure's complex personality. Grab a copy and sit back for a good read. Enjoy!

B007HJ84ZK|5.0|What a triumph this series is! With a few notable exceptions, Fantasy has been a long neglected genre and this show really lifts the lid on its potential. I've only read the first novel that the series is based on and have to say, it didn't really get me in. The TV version though hits all the right notes. There are characters you love and some you loath and plenty that just intrigue the hell out of you! There is heaps of action and some jarring plot twists. Characters can engage you completely one minute and be dead the next. I love the unpredictability of it all! The thing I am most grateful for is that the makers have done it properly. Castles look like castles. Halls look like medieval halls and there are a host of supporting actors and extras to give a clear sense of the grand sweep of the events. There are no wobbling sets here. This is a quality show made to look absolutely real. Note there is extensive nudity at times, very strong language and some very gory scenes. All to the good, as far as I'm concerned. These are real people living in very troubled times and they express themselves accordingly. The stakes are high and mistakes in this world mean the loss of everything!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This film has always been one of my favorites. It's brilliant in all aspects. Love the writing, the acting, and the Cat Stevens score. A beautifully poignant film.

B00846TTDG|1.0|I thought the cinematography was okay when it was touted as being spectacular.  However, the acting is what killed it for me.  It's so hard to care if the characters live or die when the acting is so terrible.  I just could not get into this but really tried to.  I really thought based on the reviews this would have been a better film, but it wasn't a film - it was a terrible movie.  Real actors do make a difference whether we like it or not.

0812983459|4.0|arming There are a variety of issues that people face as they get older, but one of the saddest and emotionally debilitating is when people are stuck in the past with emotional trauma or negative feelings of resentment and fear. It is one of the spiritual gifts of aging that people can potentially move on towards more whole and life-giving postures of contentment, gratitude and reconciliation with one's own sense of self and closest friends and family. The sad reality, though, is that not everyone makes these moves. Research for understanding spirituality, religion and aging and expressing pastoral care may draw on psychological and therapeutic approaches, lifecycle and stages of faith theories, and theological, sociological and cultural analysis. But there are also insights to be gained from literary analysis. This review identifies a recent British novel as a significant text for exegeting the experience of aging, religion and spirituality through the lens of its major character and his spontaneous pilgrimage.<br />Rachel Joyce, a British playwright, has turned her hand to writing this novel. Her main character is Harold Fry, a recently retired salesman who was abandoned as a child. He is now living with his estranged wife Maureen, and has not seen their son David for twenty years. His life starts to change, however, after receiving a letter from Queenie, a close colleague who disappeared from his workplace years ago after being fired under suspicious circumstances. She is dying from cancer and thanks David for past kindnesses. David pens a letter of sympathy, sets off to post it around the corner, but keeps walking.<br />Inspired by the people he meets and determined to have faith that Queenie can keep living, the walk becomes a pilgrimage from southern England to Queenie's hospice in Scotland. Harold sets out to save Queenie, but redeems other things along the way. He struggles with what his life has meant and how his relationships have developed. Walking conjures memories both fond and painful - of joy in romance and fatherhood, as well as abandonment and overwhelming loss. He sets out simply - without a planned route or hiking equipment - and later simplifies further by giving away belongings and posting his wallet home. He sympathetically listens to various characters and their dilemmas, and others listen to him and help him understand his issues. The reasons why some characters pray or not, pursue pilgrimage or not, and care or not, are intriguing. For example, while Harold is reticent to pray because of past hurt and disappointment, a fellow traveller for a time seems to overeager to pray at every opportunity. The openness (or not) to prayer reveals as much about the characters' underlying anxieties as their belief (or not) in God. As fame of the pilgrimage spreads Fry becomes, for a time, a kind of Forest Gump with a following of other pilgrims with various agendas and interpersonal conflicts. Fry and the group are a window into aspects of religious expression that are sometimes attractive and life-giving and sometimes repulsive and dysfunctional.<br />The result is a delightful fictional travel narrative and folksy love story and more. It's a page-turner of a novel. It's also a thoughtful reflection on how an older man journeys with life and spirituality and where he sees religion fitting (or not). Harold Fry set out spontaneously seeking one thing, and serendipitously develops in other needed directions of self-discovery, reconciliation and coming to terms with disappointment, tragedy and pain. He walks 627 miles over 87 days, and discovers insights for himself and others that he did not expect. The book addresses themes of work, dislocation, health, sexuality, family, social expectations and aging in entertaining and thought-provoking episodes along the road.<br />The novel is relevant to aging in general, but has particular relevance for considering the implications of masculinities for aging. It explores how mennavigate relationships and social expectations, gender and sexuality, vocation and aging. These are important factors in men's experience of religion and spirituality and in the pastoral care of men, as long as religion and pastoral care takes a broad interest in men's lives and not be limited to just narrow devotional aspects.<br />Fry actually finds little time for focused prayer. He lets others pray but finds it hard, or incoherent, to pray himself. Yet his pilgrimage and walking evolve as an explicit expression of faith for his friend Queenie. And it provides space for his own meditation and growth in life-giving directions.<br />At the risk of a clich&eacute;, Fry does find value in the journey rather than the destination. It is half way through the pilgrimage and the book that he begins to really find himself, transparently deal with his motivations and simplify his walk. In Joyce's words:<br />\\"Harold believed his journey was truly beginning. He had thought it started the moment he decided to walk to Berwick, but he saw now that he had been naïve. Beginnings could happen more than once, or in different ways. You could think you were starting something afresh, when actually what you were doing was carrying on as before. He had faced his shortcomings and overcome them, and so the real business of walking was happening only now.\\" (p.178)<br />Even the end of the journey becomes a fresh start for deeper reconciliation with meaning.<br />This reviewer especially appreciated the prompting of the book to prioritise fathering before it is too late, to find and pursue a vocation that really matters, and to have the courage to stand up against injustice and jerks who think they can assert their own masculinity by belittling others.<br />Today thousands of millions of people travel the world as tourists. Typically they cover many miles in a few days, take their belongings in large suitcases and buy more products and souvenirs along the way. An alternative travel mode is pilgrimage - a more ancient tradition that is growing in popularity. Pilgrims usually takes longer to travel shorter distances than tourists, and do so with more intentionality for self-reflection and spiritual development. For twenty-first century spirituality, pilgrimage has potential to help guide people towards greater wholeness and satisfaction. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is an entertaining novel about an unlikely pilgrim that offers thoughtful insight into the challenge and potential to grow through relationship, spirituality, work and health issues, and to get older and wiser along the journey. The book encourages travel - geographic and metaphoric - that goes deeper than surface-level tourism but to pursue travel and life with purpose and transparency.<br />This review was originally published in Journal of Religion, Spirituality and Aging, Vol.25, Issue.3 (2013), 277-279.navigate relationships and social expectations, gender and sexuality, vocation and aging.

B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This is a very informative, yet easy to follow book<br />Whether  you choose to follow this plan is up to you, but I would definitely recommend a read of this book regardless.<br />It's interesting and thought provoking at the very least.

B002YVAT72|1.0|When I first started using it, it was fine and worked well. It plugs into your computer and you can record the songs onto your computer, but let me tell you that this takes SO LONG. It's not even worth it. I used it for about one month until it stopped working. The entire mechanism that is supposed to return the needle when it reaches the end was messed up, so it kept returning the needle when I would try to initially place the needle on the vinyl. I took it to multiple music stores and they said they can't fix it, and apparently plenty of people have had this issue with this specific brand turntable. This product is awful, and you really should not waste your money. For $100+ it should work perfectly, and it doesn't work AT ALL. Save your money.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key is a story about the Vel' d' Hiv round-up during World War II.  It is told from two different perspectives; a Polish-Jew child from the World War II era and an American Expatriate living in France; present day.<br /><br />The story is littered with tough decisions; both for Sarah, the young girl, and for Julia, present day expatriate.  These decisions determine the life path of both characters.<br /><br />Sarah in particular is forced to grow up fast; witnessing acts of violence and indifference so heinous, at times I took pause before continuing the story.  Sarah also experiences random acts of kindness from acquaintances and strangers.  Unfortunately, those bright spots are few and far between.<br /><br />Julia also experiences growing pains, but in a different sense.  She becomes her own person while confronting a situation going against her husband's wishes.  She also doggedly pursues the conclusion to Sarah's story.<br /><br />I appreciated the author satisfying my curiosity regarding &#34;the rest of the story.&#34; I also appreciated the finale.  The author brought the main story line to a close and gave just enough detail for the reader to draw his or her own conclusions regarding how Julia’s story ends.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in a story that nicely dovetails two stories, sheds light on a obscured historical event demonstrating the far-reaching authority of Nazi terror, and portraying its main characters not as victims of society, but as proactive and smart women; never giving in and always moving forward.
6305882592|4.0|This was a decent movie, but not one of my favorites.  I bought it on the advise of a friend who absolutely LOVED IT and obviously<br />got more out of it than I did.  I think I was looking for something 'different' while persuing it.

B007QDNKQA|5.0|If you trusted the government before you watch this movie, you may have second thoughts. Plots within plots and plenty of action.  They shouldn't have killed his dog.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|Freshly retired from his villainous ways, the growling, ill-tempered, super-villian Gru must now deal with the mundane life of raising three orphan girls.  Hard to temper his curmudgeonly ways, he is quickly recruited for his talents as a former mastermind villain to hunt down another mastermind villain.  Lucy Wilde, Gru's unconventional recruiter, becomes his sleuthing partner as a collection of possible culprits are investigated.<br /><br />Familiar story lines of parenting young love while juggling a return to the dating scene are seamlessly intertwined into an entirely new movie.  Plenty of humor throughout, the pacing is very good, and there are no dull moments.  There are even references that only 40+ year-olds would catch.  Some scenes may mildly frighten the very young as much as a Scooby Doo cartoon does.  Still, my seven and six year-old daughters loved this movie, asking if we can \\"download\\" this movie to watch at home.  And my fourteen year-old niece and eight year-old nephew enjoyed the movie too.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed familiar characters in entirely new situations, as well as some new memorable characters.  I would highly recommend this movie for families, teens, and adults alike.
B00514908S|5.0|Despite an over-exhuberant Kevin Costner and his over the top marksmanship, this is a great movie for western fans.  I particularly loved the dialogue between the Kevin Kline and Brian Dennehy characters.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|good writing, good acting and fun to look at - they may have rewritten history somewhat but they bring the period to life in grand fashion. Jeremy Irons is especially good and the bad guys are great at being evil.<br /><br />PS - Don't mix this up with another series called &#34;Borgias' which was unwatchable because the lead character was impossibly miscast (very hard to believe a 15th century pope would have a Texas accent).
B002M80918|5.0|Gritty action with flawed heroes and villians with distorted codes of honor.  Guns that actually have to be re-loaded and even mis-fire on ocassion.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|Where do I begin? Turtle Beach brings you into the fight with their surround sound headphones. They are easily the most well known gaming headsets from my part of town and all the good gamers have a pair. These are on the low end of their market, and they're STILL amazing. Even listening to music on these is another lovely experience. Great Ps3, PC, and Xbox360 compatible headphones, love them. I've heard endless amounts of people and reviews claiming that these headphones broke and didn't last at all but I really see no issue. Mine came packaged fine, on time, and working great. No buzzing in the left earmuff, the headset did not ever break at the pivot point or anything. I bought these last year on July 20th 2012 and it is July 8th 2013 now. They still have ZERO issues at all, nearly a year now. I can personally say that I get pissed off at my games too, I've launched these things across the room more than once and they still have NO problems. I guess I just got the luckiest headset of the bunch?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The author captured the contemporary &#34;lingo&#34; of our day and did not use predictable and tired phraseology during dialogue and narration of the story.  I haven't finished yet, but have read enough to  hazard some guesses as to how it may end.

In the game there are little helpers in the way of bombs, more time hourglass and my favorite lightening. Also when the color wheel gets filled by making matches of 4 or more then you can blast the playing field destroying many pieces. Loving it and it runs perfectly on my Firehd.

If you believe in reincarnation and like reading about it...you will be blown away by Dr. Michael Newton's series of works on the subject of 'life between lives' that he accidentally discovered.  This is one of those,,,'you cannot make this stuff up'.  I am very surprised I have not read his work before now.  I savor all types of material concerning the afterlife, reincarnation, souls and soulmates.  If you do too, you will love all his books.  Gives you an altogether viewpoint on life.

I am amazed that I can feel so connected to characters and places so foreign to me.  I loved this book from page 1 and had a hard time putting it down.  I couldn't wait to find out how he would bring all the characters full circle in the end.  It's one of those books that stays with you for a few days when are done reading it, yet its not quite as heavy as  The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. Highly recommend this book, especially if you have read his others.

630522577X|4.0|Musicals are not my cup of tea, but I've watched this one several times and enjoyed it each time.  The music arises naturally out of the story and joins one scene to another beautifully.  It is a fairy tale, of course, in which a poverty-stricken Cockney flower seller (Audrey Hepburn) is transformed into a princess by a linguist (Rex Harrison), who teaches her how to speak proper English and drills her in the social graces of London society. Her tutor is a boorish, self-centered snob, whose own mother can barely tolerate him.  Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison make this story both believable and delightful.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ending offers an unexpected and disappointing outcome to what would otherwise have been a triumph for the flower-girl- turned-princess.
0425263924|2.0|I loved the first 2 books of the series, I read both of them in a day because I couldn't help myself. I read this book in a day too simply because I was waiting for a twist, or some sort of major plot climax...when I finished I actually thought something was wrong with my kindle, and the download wasn't completed. You could actually read chapter one, and the last one and there is no need to read the rest- because nothing happens!
0812984412|1.0|After reading recent reviews of this book on Reddit.com and having seen the movie when it first came out I decided to check out the book as I am an avid reader of sci-fi/fantasy.<br /><br />So I first searched for the book on my Kindle app on my smart phone.  The first edition that came up was a movie tie in book for $12.99.  Way too expensive, I just wanted to read the book not get behind the scene videos of the movie and such. But this was the only version listed when I scrolled down the search list.<br /><br />So I went on my Kindle Fire.  Again, I found only the movie tie in when searching for Cloud Atlas.  I had to search for the author's name and found the book only, but it is $11.99!  Outrageous!  I don't care if the book was made into a movie.  They must have upped the price of the book to only a dollar less than the movie tie in to entice buyers to buy that one as it's 'only a dollar more'.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed by this tactic and sad that now I will not read this book.  At least until possibly when the price comes down.<br /><br />Very disappointed.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun app! Great time killer fun and challenging brain teaser to keep tourism working! Played for an hour felt like 5 minutes:D
B008LP8QE8|5.0|Classic and essential book for Internal Medicine practitioners, with a very clear graphic format, equivalent to the printed book.<br />A little bit heavy for older devices.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|There is so much intrigue, drama, and excitement.  The movies follow the books wonderfully, but am glad I read the books first.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|I find that I get stuck easily, especially if I'm trying to work for three stars all the time. Have fun!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have read the books many times, now I have the series to put my imagination into living color!  I Love it!
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|It took a while to understand the game, and it is still a decent challenge when you do understand it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of this show. I had a big smile on my face one minute, laughing the next, then moved to tears. Once again, I was sorry to see it end
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game why because I'm in Paris and that where I want to go and I just love the jet with the beautiful color
B00003CXBH|5.0|I had only seen this once but loved the soundtrack.  A lot of food for thought in this movie.  Especially when viewing the accompanying disc.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|David Cook puts every ounce of energy into his work.  Love the ethic!  Love the Music! Keep it up David.  My wife and I, each, have to have our own copies!
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Saw this 50-year old movie in its first run.  Loved it then.  Love it on DVD.  You can't beat Hitchcock.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|All three of the books in the Clifton Series were a great read.  Sure hope Jeffrey Archer is writing a fourth
B000000WFZ|5.0|Blundered onto this soundtrack on cassette many years ago. Loved it without having seen the movie. (A snippet was used in a commercial for coffee from Columbia).
B004GJYROG|5.0|all the jokes and toons that I remember. introduced to a new generation of kids. a great family film you will all love
160059672X|5.0|Sherry's tips and methods are great.  I've been able to sew and embroider forever but just recently discovered bead embroider and I think I'm hooked for life!  I've definitely found a new love in bead embroidery and Sherry has given me tons of inspiration.
B000ID1J40|5.0|This movie is a great mix of mystery and humor. It has a great story and a great cast. Highly recommend.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|it is fun for about 5 minutes..I'm not saying anemone is dumb but it is just really boring trust me!
0425263924|5.0|I loved how Sylvia tied all the lose ends from the 2 previous books. A must read for all of her fans. You will fall in love with Gideon and Eva all over again;)
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|This wasn't the best die hard by far it's probably the worst in the series but it's still a die-hard movie and is better the second time around not sure what the difference is about the unrated cut the same running time and I didn't notice a difference
1589795474|4.0|This book was referred to several times in the book &#34;Kingdom People&#34;.  It is helpful in understanding that the amount of  tangible materials (big houses, fancy cars, expensive clothes and country club membersip doesn't necessarily make a person a millionaire.
B008220BLG|4.0|I thought the movie was really good take on zombies and Romeo and Juliet. I would recommend it for zombie fans And anybody that likes a good love story
B00633W614|5.0|I can't believe this book is already over!  It was better than the first but once again left us with a cliffhanger!
B008JFUQ16|4.0|It is some time after the events of the first movie and ex- villian turned father Gru is actually enjoying family life, even with a nosy neighbor/matchmaker trying to get him attached to all sorts of friends.  But when a secret lab is taken, the Anti-Villan league, headed by Director Ramsbottom, need Gru's help in discovering who stole the lab and the dangerous chemical within. With his unasked for partner Agent Lucy Wilde, he goes undercover in the local mall to find out who is the criminal and put an end to the evil plot.  And maybe also find someone who is perfect for him.<br /><br />I watched this when it came out and I loved it, it builds on the strengths of the first movie and tweaks it enough that the story really flows.  You actually see Gru as a good parent figure, going out of his way to make sure Agnes's party is not ruined, to normal father issues like boys and Margo (that was funny).  I would recommend wathcing it in the theaters and this will be added to my collection when it comes out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you like 50 shades, you'll like the crossfire series too! Her writing is great. Great depth to the relationships of the characters. Erotic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever its worth all the money you pay! make sure you update whenever you can because it just gets better everytime! This is my favorite game I have on my kindle! this game is just awesome! its perfff
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Love the music on this album. The new(ish) singer was a great find, he sounds close enough to know it's still Alice, but not an exact copy of Layne.
B0049VZ222|2.0|So I had heard about The Walking Dead through word of mouth; people were telling me that it was a cult hit.  I downloaded Season 1 to watch on my flight across the Atlantic (where clearly there are not a lot of options for entertainment.  The only reason that I finished watching was that I had very few alternatives to occupy me as I sat in my economy-class seat.  The zombies look ridiculous and are anything but scary.  There are a couple of scenes that are supposed to tug at your heart strings, but instead make you cringe at the bad acting.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|Shipped fast. This was for a xmas present so I didn't watch it but I haven't heard any complaints so I assume it was fine.  The movie itself was crude but hilarious!  I saw it in the movies.
B006LSZECO|3.0|There are some stories I will only read once.  This is one of them.  I really don't like any of the characters, but they are written well enough that the story kept me reading.
B00081U7HC|3.0|Video seems fine but the case on both videos were broken. I bought it for a friend for xmas so I had to give it to her or be late.  Shipping was fast though.
0920236251|4.0|LOVE this story.  Its a great one for girls to read when they are growing up.  The book itself was smaller than I expected and was not obviously spelled out in the description.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King has struck gold AGAIN!  The book has an easy to follow story with a few surprises as only King can bring. Great read!
1476719071|4.0|...but I read it in an afternoon.  This book sucked me straight in and wouldn't let me go.  Everything that people hate about this book is what I love.  I enjoy that both characters are deeply flawed and just trying to find their way through an intense and complicated attraction.  Yes, Travis is a spoiled baby and gets completely unhinged when things don't go his way, and yes, after the twelfth time that happend, I was annoyed.  And yes, Abby comes across as wishy-washy and at times I thought she was making choices just to prolong what everyone else already knew - that she was going to hook up with Travis.<br /><br />*potentional SPOILER* Where is Abby really from?  There is a hesitation in the dialogue everytime she mentiones Wichita or Kansas...and when the foursome goes to Vegas, she runs into her ex, knows everyone at the casino.  Yet, America and Shepley go to Kansas over break.  GRR, that bugged me throughout the book.<br /><br />I found myself both loving and hating these characters, rooting for them to get together and then wishing they'd just realise how dysfunctional they were acting.  To me, that's great writing - for me to feel so much over these characters means the author did her job.<br /><br />The end seemed rushed - the epilogue a little too cutesy after the anguish and pain of the previous 20 chapters.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to fans of romance novels and YA/NA fiction.
B0062QRTKA|3.0|With the game play, they could have developed it further with Moses going against the Pharaoh with the different plagues since it could have him fighting against the snakes and frogs and such but all in all it was okay but crossing the water gets boring after a while.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you have been watching HBO's Game of Thrones, reading these books will fill in all of the blank spots and give far better insight as to the thoughts and motivations of each of the characters.
075669812X|4.0|My son loves Ninjago thought this was pretty cool when he first got it.  He lost interest though after about a week.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I got this for my gran where we enjoy playing this, I actually try to do the \\"help me part\\" which isn't so easy to figure out for a grandma. This new version is great, and love traveling time parts. Good graphics and great time killer..hours of fun!
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|Great movie!! Touches on so many profound issues. The message of beauty underlying all things is fantastic! Kudos to all.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Nice long read if someone hates to decide on a new book and like a routine. See my comment on The great hunt. :)
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This was great - anything that makes me sweat and be on edge has my vote LOL<br />Plus,, he is not playing outside his age back to his old ways of superman, and it is great.  well directed and composed, and made the fbi look like idiots.  they have more clout than what this shows,, but then it wouldnt leave the sheriff the hero. Lot of shooting and killing so keep the little kids out. probably pg13
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The title says it all. I have been using it for over a year now. Works great. Is lighting fast. You cannot beat the power for the price. I will not be upgrading unless there is a super sale on the i7 3750k.
B005775OBG|5.0|They were very happy to finally  get the other spy car. Wish he could have been bought separate, have a lot of Finn McMissile cars.<br />detail great, good find for out collection.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoyed the book. I really like historical fiction. It reminded me of Gone with the Wind. Give it a try.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a fun,engaging and creative game. My only issue, and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that I wanted more!  While not really short, short,  the game could have been longer...
B00017LSK8|5.0|As long as I can get it out of my old Polaroid it's excellent film. If you have trouble getting the first pack of film out of the camera, try putting some tape on the dark sheet before removal to reinforce the tab. I went thru 3 packs of new color film and still can't get it right everytime. I'm saving this B&W until I learn the process.
0553212419|4.0|A lot in a small book.  But good stories, but I need to take a rest every now and then for my eyes!
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|If you have seen one of them, you would love this collection. Some great action packed films that add a little comady in. From the first to the last you will enjoy!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i like this app but i think its easyer to use on the computer rather than tablet but other than that its a good app
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|LOVED IT! This season was awesome!! Totally addicted to this show! Highly recommend buying it and seeing it for yourself!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I reallly like having it. I work a lot with numbers. It is quick, effecient, easy to use and easy on the eyes.
1427229201|5.0|I quite enjoyed this one as much as the first two. The cliff hanger from the second book was resolved, but now we have a third. He had better hurry up with the next two books!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun, it makes me think of every option to make me escape. It reminds me of the game 100 floors.
B004HWKWL4|5.0|I have only read several books on NDE's, but this one by far is the most interesting and comforting.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in knowing what awaits us all on the other side.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out on DVD, and watched it again just this past (hot) weekend, and it was very good both times. The characters are a nice mix of genre stock and unique individuals, but because the genres are mixed (western and sci-fi), the stock aspects are interesting in themselves, so the individual touches add even more depth. The opening single-shot scene is amazing, actually, and the action never lets up. It's a taut, tense, interesting movie, with a complex stories that flows because the script and director don't pander.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|What a set.  There is nothing quite like seeing a neat little book-like package filled with the Alien movies.  The transfer is crystal clear and adds more depth to the film.  Please buy!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Overall a great app, but it has an annoying bug that each time I ask for the weather at the new location, the weather data moves down the screen a quarter of an inch -- I think it's a side effect of the app wanting to put a visual image of the weather at the top of the screen.  So instead of replacing the prior image, it pushes the data down the screen, and so if I look at the weather of a few locations, the data is so far down that I have to quit and restart the app.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Expected random funny stuff without much of a storyline. Still not the best, but was actually not bad and was pretty entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun And entertaining. Also has a lot of levels so u cant get bored. A good game to play but it hard to get past a level when u don't get any hints
B008602KQI|5.0|Good storyline. Good entertainment. Good acting. Not on my top 5 movies list by any means, but well worth the watch.
B007ED9FIY|4.0|Although I remain a more devout fan of the novel, this movie delivers.  Clooney & cast fill the screen with believable family relationships and trauma.  The viewer is welcomed into the fold to experience love, imperfection, and ultimately, healing.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great acting by everyone in the show.  With each episode having it's own riveting legal story, along with the Florrick saga, the program grabs my attention and keeps it throughout the show and from one episode to the next.  Really love watching the series through Amazon Instant Video.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter since she kept bugging me to get it. She loves this CD so much, I can hear her play it over and over again.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I love this movie because it was a true story and the ending was a surprise.  I enjoy great surfing movies and admire the skill that it takes
B005HWUCMC|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter because she loves Rihanna and she loves it. She says that the CD is great and wants me to get her more of Rihanna's CD's.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The download was easy. No problems when watching the episode. I love Downton Abbey anyway but this was very simple to catch up on an episode.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever I have bought if you are going to buy this app you are on the right track it is not a waste of money
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game.  Works your brain just enough but not too much.  I would like to see a lot more levels though.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 4 year old and I enjoy playing this together. She does 90% by herself and what little she needs help with I actually enjoy playing.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|First of all, the grammar in this book is horrendous. It constantly turned me off to it throughout the read.<br /><br />But that aside, this book does present some useful takes on the different approaches to conversation. Additionally, it delivers the advice in a logical, systematic process of identifying the problem, reflecting, and then offering suggestions. I use \\"suggestions\\" because there is never a really definitive answer to any of the questions asked at the beginning. However, that is to be expected, because this is not a very concrete topic to write about, and therefore I would not expect a concrete answer. Some would say that conversation \\"comes naturally,\\" but most of us know that is not the case.<br /><br />The author took the correct approach to this topic by attacking the root and stressing a change of attitude and perception toward conversation and socializing rather than a list of hard remedies. If the latter is what you're looking for, then you will probably be disappointed by this read; however, I think that you would gain some useful information from this book regardless.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Daft punk is an all-time favorite of mine.<br /><br />The hype was so large on this CD and I really expected more. I know any remixes that come from this album will be great, but I just feel in comparison to some other albums (like Discovery or Homework) there was a much larger number of songs I just couldnt get into.<br /><br />Overall I'd still say its a buy. Enough songs are good to justify the price and I'm always willing to support great artists!
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Good for a laugh. Glad I paid 99 cents when it was on sale. Good dynamic between Tatum and Hill. I say go for it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This thermal paste is fantastic. It's been purchased a half dozen times and always been in my tool kit when building a PC.<br /><br />I never use the thermal tape from the stock coolers or any off-brand paste. Even on crappy heatsinks you will see a few degrees C of performance increase.<br /><br />My only con/warning is not to use this on GPU ASICs or VRAM. It can scratch or short which are two big no-nos on a GPU. This doesn't at all affect CPUs so don't worry!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The amount of time I have (NOT) wasted on this game is incredible. Its addictive and fun and you will not regret trying this FREE game. Yes you can pay for coins to augment you game but it truly is not necessary. If you remember the simple helicopter games of yester-year, this will be very easy to pick up. Really one button to press ANYWHERE on the screen to have Barry (the main character) fly up. Letting go turns off the jetpack and you fall, all to avoid obstacles that stop your run. The urge to complete the challenges and keep playing will outlast ANY doctor's visit wait or shopping trip with the Misses. Get this game.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, as I'm a sucker for the whole prequel genre and I was really excited to learn about Oz's backstory. Unfortunately, this movie just doesn't deliver. My biggest problem with it is the uneven tone throughout. At times it seems like it was going for majestic dramatic sequences (which is more the impression I got from the previews), and at other times it relies on pure slapstick humor. The dialogue between Oz (Franco) and the monkey companion he acquires when he gets to the land of Oz is pretty corny and honestly unnecessary. Other important elements of the plot (like the relationship between the wicked witch and her sister) seemed underdeveloped to me, and it just seems like the makers of the film missed a chance to really focus on the deeper message at the heart of the original movie. All in all, there are a number of impressive visuals in the movie that are worth checking out, but I wouldn't recommend spending any money to see them. Wait for a free version on Prime, tv, etc.
193700788X|1.0|I am still so disappointed in the ending. I am normally sad when movies or shows stray from the book, but I am willing to make and exception in this case.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|easy to play easy to load, mind less entertainment. for those days when you are bored or tired of waiting for words with friends to play their turns
B00846REIS|5.0|Milder version of the fifty shades of grey excluding the bdsm and still it's very nice. Loved it! Milder domination and possessiveness.
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|Haven't loaded in over 30 min still waiting had to cancel game . And it keep bringing up ads on my kindle causeing it to crash every few minutes
B003Y8YXFS|5.0|I bought a copy of this LP in London in 1970 so it is a trip down memory lane. My brother recommended I look for the CD on Amazon after I gave him the vynl version - no record player!<br />Excellent service and arrived before anticipated.
B009VMN3RA|3.0|I liked Sachi!  Of course you have to read most of this with a grain of salt, but let's say that 1/2 of it at least, is true, then that poor girl had some real weirdos for parents!  I totally believe in past lives, so I'm not speaking out about that part of it AT ALL.  I'm talking about the selfish Mind Eff'ing that they did to her.  I'm not a fan of Shirley so it didn't change anything.  I did however have empathy for Sachi and I'm happy that she seems to have been able to get her life to such a nice place.  Next life Sachi..ask for kinder parents!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed playing I'd give it 5 stars the clues were great and the map helped a lot. I played the free version and then bought the next part and both were great the time didn't end quick  So u really got your monies worth. Looking forward to the next one. Way to go big fish
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like that it was free!  This game is fun and challenging.  It isn't too hard or too easy, but makes you think.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I love it because you don't know whats going to come up next  and that you can change the background. And its really FUN!
B00CL0J99K|1.0|The Manadarin isn't about a beer guzzling drunk named Trevor. He has the 10 rings of power, and is Iron Man's greatest foe. What they did was cheat the lovers of the Iron Man comic, and made it completely something else. I rate this up there to the Richard Lester cut of Superman 2, and the fake powers. Some director's werent meant to do comic book movies. One being Richard Lester, and now Shane Black...
B004SUWR2C|5.0|its fun to play on long road trips. And just fun to play! I just really love it. Its fun
B003NJPOAQ|5.0|Enjoy upbeat, but relaxing music by Jack Johnson.  To me, this is one of his top albums.  Would highly recommend.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I could not put the book down.  It was an absolute page turner filled with twists and turns.  Great book, great series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is very thought provoking. It is very good problem solving practice. Highly recommended for game players of any age.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|It's a very fun game but why does the things unlock has to cost money please take my advice and update it so kids can have fun playing the game for free.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I have a Master's in English Language and Literature. I think this is one of the best versions of any Austen novel. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are convincing as Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth, and the subtext of the Royal Navy and its meritocracy are underlined without belaboring the point.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. Kept me wanting to keep reading. Strongly suggest this book and serious to anyone who likes to read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I want many MORE LEVELS . PLEASE PLEASE it IS SO COOL. I COULDN'T STOP ONCE I STARTED LOVE THIS GAME. FUN FUN FUN
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|It's a great app and way better than anything u can get and all the new features are amazing. There is no lagging and it runs great on my kindle fire hd yet it supports a couple ads and pop ups and they really push to buying in game purchases
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|THIS CAME IS FUN, BUT THE CONSTANT HAGGLING FOR MORE MONEY IS OR SHOULD BE DEMEANING TO AMAZON.  WHEN MONEY IS EARNED PLAYERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY COINS.  A PLAYER COULD SPEND LOTS OF $ ON THIS GAME, BUT THAT SHOWS AMAZON'S GREED.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fantastic book about the life, struggles and successes of a truly inspirational American.  I am lucky to have stumbled across It.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|The true documentary of Bob Marley with some amazing sound and images.  A wicked choice as a watch now on streaming Amazon Prime!  Awesome!!!
B000W74EQC|4.0|Undoubtedly targeted at a very young audience, there's a certain degree of magic dancing around this picture that makes it easily-accessible to adults as well. Although my own childhood was long gone by the time this hit theaters, watching it today was like leaping back through time to an age filled with innocence and wonder. That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I bought the world pass, but a lot of times I can't play worlds 6 and after because it doesn't recognize the purchase I guess. Please fix and I'll make it five stars.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|Everything is too on the nose; from the acting to the writing; way too tv-ish for my taste. This is no The Wire (not even close).  The one episode I've seen makes it a wannabe and nothing more.
B00C81LYH2|4.0|This 25th Silver Anniversary Christmas barbie is a real looker.  My teen son even commented She's hot!  She's got silver from her eye shadow and sparkling earrings and also cascading down her gown in delicate snowflakes.  Red accents her lips and fingernails. She's got a runway pose and comes with her own stand.  The extended angled hand would make it difficult for changing outfits with sleeves but this is a collector's item not necessarily a child's plaything.<br /><br />I'd recommend saving this for your personal collection and buying something more appropriate for your child to play with, something with child friendly bling.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I hate how many things are locked because you did not buy the $3.00 full version!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE CHANGE PRICE AND HOW MANY THINGS ARE LOCKED!!!
B00B769XB8|5.0|Great movie.  I expected the movie to come earlier, but it is one that we will watch often.  Great job
B00BKRON5K|5.0|This all makes sense and was an easy read. Enjoyed it! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the lifestyle.
B000FC130E|5.0|If I could get to Neil Gaiman's underside of London I would. The characters were so fleshed out I feel like I've met them before. In a dream.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Updates rule!! Love the game.buy it now!!! You'll love it It's fun.I love the updates too the game is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This is great for any iPod too old to have Bluetooth, or one that doesn't have internet. It's so much cheaper than purchasing an iTouch when you just want it to hold music. You can hook up any iPod to your car, speakers, etc. Wonderful!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I'm not really sure if this product works. My Kindle Fire is still having issues charging. Amazon is sending me a new one, so we'll see if it works then. Fingers crossed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Started off a little slow...didn't really understand how to play game. But a lot of fun and very addicting after I got the hang of it
B00846REIS|1.0|Gideon is creepy and kind of a whiny baby. The heroine is annoying. All of this is insanely predictable and a snooze fest. Why do these characters love each other? There's no shred of emotion between them, all they do is argue and have sex! it's boring! This is just a ripoff of 50, based on a really unhealthy relationship of 2 people who constantly say one anothers name , have unimaginative sex, fight about how strange the other person is, and whine. Skip it, unless you like that kinda story.
B00772M1F6|5.0|If you like Huey Lewis and the News you should enjoy this album.  I am looking forward to a follow up.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland by Stephen King<br />In 1973, Devin Jones was in love with Wendy Keegan; they had dated for more than two years and had been together for almost every moment of that time. Then, for summer vacation, instead of staying and working in the cafeteria as always with Devin, Wendy decided to work in Boston with her best friend. Devin heartbroken, applied for a job at Joyland in North Carolina. He interviewed during the spring break. Before catching his bus back to the college, he stopped by Emmaline Shoplaw's boarding house to arrange for a room to rent over the summer while he worked at the park.<br />Before he left, she fed him lunch and told him the story of the ghost of the horror house at Joyland. She said she hadn't seen the ghost herself, because she wouldn't go to the horror house. She knew s murder had been committed. She told Dev the story she had gleaned from newspapers and from her Joyland friends.<br />Once he began working at Joyland, the fortune teller there told him that he'd meet a little girl wearing a red hat and holding a doll and a little boy with a dog.<br />The breakup, the ghost of the girl, the girl with the doll, the boy with the dog, and wearing the fur all have an impact on Devin Jones during his time at Joyland.<br />Some years, we just feel things more intensely than others. No one expresses this better than Stephen King, or brings back the memories of those times better. He is also the master of the craft when it comes to character development.<br />Joyland is not a horror story; it is a murder mystery and a coming of age story, mixed with the bittersweet realization of the frailty of life. It is lovely and sad, and ultimately lonely, as so often beautiful things are.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great character development, including the house itself. period detail is amazing. Great writing, editing, acting and stories of huge fortunes passed down through the ages,
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Great effort to bring Doctor Who back to TV with familiar story lines, monsters and moral choices.  What isn't familiar and the reasons this rated a 5 star rating are firstly Billie Piper,as Rose, as the perfect companion, representative of the best of  humanity, and lovable gooey ball of human emotion.  Secondly,  the writing, directing and all the other aspects of generating each episode are clearly done by skilled people who care.  Thirdly, Captain Jack is introduced and explained.  \\"The Empty Child\\" is the one Dr, Who story that never entirely leaves my mind.<br />Thanks, and gratitude to all.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a free app, so I figured why not. Most of the levels are fairly easy, but the last two were hard. Can't wait for new levels!
1416955070|1.0|If you don't mind stupid heroines who recklessly drag their friends and family into situations of unnecessary danger then you might enjoy this series. However be warned that the romance in the first 3 books is spoiled by incestuous themes, the 4th book by demonic possession, and the 5th book by incest again.  On the whole a disappointing series both from a romantic strongpoint and female lead.
B00B19GKI0|2.0|None of the movies are watchable due to the poor quality of connection.  It sucks to have a service that does not work.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I have watched this film countless times.  When asked if I was marooned on a desert island and could only take one movie with me, what would it be?  I inevitably reply &#34;Independence Day.&#34;  It has personal drama, planetary threats, romance, humor, excitement... just about anything one could ask for.  The eye candy of Jeff Goldblum's muscles and chest in this one and everything Will Smith is a bonus.  Watch it!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I was born in 1991 so Silence of the Lambs came out around that time, and obviously I wasn't able to watch it. When I heard NBC was making a show about Hannibal Lecter I was curious. The original novels and movies were a little before my time, and this show presented a great way to get into Harris's work. I was not disappointed. This is a great modern setting for Hannibal and provides a way for a younger generation to appreciate the work Thomas Harris has created.<br /><br />Hugh Dancy (Will Graham) and Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal Lecter) are the leads in this program and they play off each other beautifully. Dancy is actually British and portrays an American accent very convincingly. Mikkelsen keeps his fine Danish accent (and I am not complaining in the slightest).<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburne, Caroline Dhavernas, Hettienne Park, and, Kacey Rohl all give spectacular performances as well. Though Gillian Anderson is in another class of her own. She is stunning in this series as Hannibal's psychiatrist.<br /><br />This show pulls you in and doesn't let go. If you are squeamish this may not be the TV series for you. But it is a definite must for any old or new fans of Hannibal Lecter. But don't expect a copy performance from Mads Mikkelsen. He plays it differently than Sir Anthony Hopkins did in the three previous movies, and that is a good thing. He puts his own twist on Hannibal. Trust me, it's brilliant.
1455502626|5.0|If I wouldn't have bought the book myself, I would have been sure it was new. A little creasing in spine but 100% all over! Shipping was super fast!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|After being away for so long I was excited to hear that the guys were getting back together and putting out a new album. I listened to this over and over upon receiving it to get myself ready for their concert. I love when I can put a cd in and let it play all the way through without skipping a track. Listening to this cd brought me back to my high school days of listening to these guys. I really am digging this cd.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game so much that I cant put it down it is amazingly awesome and you all should get it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Bring on more rooms we loved finding our way out<br /><br />Leslie and Thea<br /><br />Great Granddaughter and I loved figuring it out together<br /><br />Thank you bring on more rooms
B005VPRFSY|5.0|If you're a lego fan then you understand the quality of product they produce. This set met their standards (as they all do) and I am happy to add it to my collection.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have always loved Jane Eyre and have watched many film versions and this is definitely one of my favorites. Ruth Wilson does a great job as the heroine and Toby Stephens is a good Rochester.
B00846TRHY|3.0|it had an interesting plot and good acting, but it was sort of choppy in the flow of the film
B00AR83PN4|4.0|This game is fun and challenging all at the same time. A tetris version of 3D chess. A compromise between mindless and deep thinking.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I had never really seen her in anything other than Salt. I thought she did a fabulous job in that movie so I tried another one. This particular movie was very moving. I have a friend who went through something similar and Angelina knocked this one out of the park.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Fun game. Better off to spend the money and buy the app. The free app drives you nuts with all the ads
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Invest in yourself and read this book.  This isn't self-help, it's reality.  The sooner we face it the better off we are.
0374275637|5.0|I gave it to my son-in-law -he loves it! I will borrow it from him eventually!  That is all I can say!
B000P6XU56|1.0|Be warned that there are apparently a lot of defective discs of this film.<br /><br />I have two sealed, new copies from two different sellers here on Amazon, and neither will play. Inspecting them, there are actually bubbles in the plastic.<br /><br />(Both sellers were great about returns, but since this is a discontinued item they didn't have any more to send me.)<br /><br />This only applies to the HD-DVD version.<br /><br />(I tend to get HD-DVD discs of films released in that format, since it's the same quality as BluRay and the discs are a heck of a lot cheaper!)<br /><br />The movie itself, of course, is great - if you can watch it.
B00AR83PN4|3.0|Want a challenge ... Cubimania is for you! I'm still trying to figure it out!!! I definitely need more instructions.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The first 30 minutes are slow and if you've never given this kind of game a chance before you might put it down too soon. Unlock the moon stage and the tank vehicle and see how much hang time you can get.
0062059963|2.0|Honestly this book made me so emotional, it took me a few months to even write a review.<br />I LOVEDLOVEDLOVEDLOVED The Selection so much and i nearly tore myself in two waiting for The Elite. And sadly, it was NOT worth the wait. I usually like to write long-ish reveiws but if i do ill probably cry or scream or throw myself out a window or something drastic, so ill keep it shorter.<br /><br />In The Selection, i loved America. I thought she was an amazing MC. she was down to earth, easy to relate to, stood up for what she believed in, and was confident. This was NOT the case in The Elite. She was insecure, and shallow, and obsessed with her boys, and ALWAYS SEEMED TO DO THE WRONG THING. Even though some of her freak outs were justified, that does not give her an excuse to act that way the whole time.<br /><br />and MAXON OH MY GOD. I was totally Team Maxon in the selection, i didnt like Aspen WHATSOEVER. My opinion has flipped. Maxon was-to put it nicely- a jerk. we wasnt the charming, cutely insecure, lovable, character he was in the first book. He has turned into quite the opposite. And aspen, basically turned into the Maxon from the first book. I just.....AH.<br /><br />Of course, Im going to read the next book in the hopes that it improves. Okay i need to stop before i kill someone. If you liked  The Selection, then you should just read through the torture that is The Elite, and have high hopes, as i do, for the next book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|So ridiculously good, all I can say is you must read this book. Completely spellbinding I can't wait to sleep now that I'm done with it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolute must have; highly recommended and best Bible free app! I've used this product and shared it with others. Very effective tool reference to have right on spot...thanks!
B000OBYLVO|4.0|Jack Black, Cameron Diaz... best movie ever!  I love this story.  I've seen it several times and it's one of my top 25 favorite.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A human interest story, must read! Just an incredible journey of survival, an escape, and a struggle to live and function in a totally different environment! My heart goes out to this young man.
B003CI90MQ|3.0|This is a good book with tons of tips. Don't buy it if you have a Point and Shoot. Find something more appropriate. It was a good read - I actually read it cover-to-cover. Just the limitations of my Point and Shoot made it difficult to try what Scott was providing as examples.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game isn't what it seems. The addiction everyone speaks of is false. This game can be very aggravating and annoying...
B001F12J0C|5.0|I am a Bourne Trilogy junkie and this is my fix. It is what you would expect, a great DVD collection.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The first time i played this game i did not think it was that good but i kept playing it and it is AWESOME
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This was awesome seeing the Rolling Stones with Muddy Waters and many more of the greatest blues singers....I would recommend any Stones fan to add this to their collection
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app does what it is suppoed to do well. You get the weather in your area and it is accurate!
0385341008|5.0|This is a fascinating, touching, and heartrending tale of the German occupation of the Isle of Guernsey during World War II.  The story is told through letters, telegrams and diary entries, and brings to life a grim chapter of history through the friendships that develop a year after the war.  It's also a love story.  The characters are quirky and interesting, and the writing style is lovely.  I've bought at least 3 copies of the book and at least 1 copy of the audio version, which is an EXCELLENT production.  Each time I think I have my own copy I end up giving it away to someone else I know will love it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It works as expected and I use it daily to keep up with family and friends. No other uses needed.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|At first I did not think I would like this movie, mainly because of all the little yellow guys running around with gibberish.<br />BUT, my grandchildren had the movie and I watched it with them.  I fell in love with this movie.  Now I own it.  The movie says a lot<br />about relationships with children and evil guys that can change into a loving parent.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I can't understand how to use it. Tutorials not apparent on my Kindle version that I can find? I am unhappy with it.
B009ZUKY52|2.0|Hi. I have enjoyed so far this product. I like the sound of the keys.<br />My only complain is an issue I have with the driver for the keyboard.<br /><br />In win7, it did not work except my laptop.<br />And, sometimes when I do not use it for a minute or so then the driver or MIDI device stops working. And, I have to restart the computer or software. It is an inconsistent behavior. The hardware looks OK.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would buy something else unless you have the luxury of time to investigate what is wrong with the driver or whatever makes the keyboard stopping.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is addictive. I love this app. the different puzzles in each level makes it more fun and entertaining. it is challenging without being boring.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Predictable at times but very entertaining and charming! The guy playing the zombie is great and i was definitely surprised at times, it's a lovestory aimed at teenagers similar to twilight but it takes itself a lot less seriously.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I just love Beth's voice, great songs, listen to it every day, dynamic duo, very good together, can't wait for next album
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I loved the whole movie, the message behind the movie to keep on trying and overcome your fears is great.  The music and colors are brilliant.  Made me want to hop a plane and fly to Rio.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter has brought me enjoyment,new friends and most of all getting to see and respond to stars out there in the big hollywood land
1594484805|5.0|This book is really made &#34;click&#34; with me. I saw a few conferences of Dan Pink on Youtube and that why I bought the book. Beside I already knew some of the book contents, still was capable of surprised me! I think it really draw the new reality in business models and what motivate us to make this change.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is a fun game. But I think that some of the people should cost less too buy. So it would kind of be easier if u do that. U can have like an less cost week were all the people cost a little less.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I liked g reader but this is much better.  I am always finding new ways to use feedly.  Everything I want to keep I just tag wth a Evernote notebook.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I stopped playing this for a while. Then I started playing it again. Ever since that company bought it has been HORRIFIC!!! Overall this app isn't the same.
B007MDB71O|4.0|John Carter (of Mars) may have suffered from one of the most incompetent marketing plans in the history of Hollywood, but the film itself is quite entertaining. Yeah, the script stumbles at the start by making Carter too much of an impulsive hothead, but the character levels out once we reach the red planet. The performances are sharp (Willem Dafoe is excellent as the voice and motion capture model of the six armed Tars Tarkas), the visuals stunning and the action very entertaining (and not so overblown as city wrecking blockbusters of 2013, Man of Steel and Star Trek Into Darkness). Overall John Carter is a well made science fiction adventure.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Installed this app from amazon because Google player doesn't allow for download. Unjustly so. Hardly any glitches on my galaxy note 2.<br /><br />Purchased the full app almost instantly after playing. Hours and hours of enjoyment. Disclaimer though. It is a big battery drain and won't work on tablets like the original galaxy tab.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Reminded me of Myst. Was sorry to finish it. Level 10 was evil! I look foreword the update. Highly recommended for hours of fun.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I really liked this movie. I like Tom Selleck  and  I like all the Jesse Stone movies. I recommend<br />this movie.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I ventured into this movie expecting great things but was also fearful of being let down.  This is a truly ground breaking film that expands the path of storytelling and connections through different characters into different times.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great movie for entire family.  The movie reminded me of Orphan Ann, but<br />DM is much more fun.  The cat (?) is hilarious!
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|I like this CD very much, Love timbaland's beats and Justin's vocals.  What could be better than that? JT is back!
