0061743526|5.0|i just love the way in which lee glorifies a humanist spirit by filtering the story through scout.  the innocent commitment to equality is really only attainable in this way, and this message is the strongest in the book. there is an obvious value to reading this, which is why students still read it today.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|got the pro version for free. glad i did n't pay for it because the pause and seek function is still hit and miss. a pretty solid radio app but could be perfect if the podcast function was improved.
1936041111|5.0|this novel forces the reader to consider how knowledge comes to be, and forces the reader to consider the way experience and knowledge can result in power for both good and evil. it is a wonderfully introspective novel that raises important questions, including difficult questions such as those questions about religion.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|Just everything about this movie I loved, you will love this movie even if you are no an anime fan.
B004FOA84A|5.0|ill be the first to say, this a very short game but regardless its a very good game.  another issue with the game is that it force closes whenever your device goes into sleep mode. its bit annoying but im looking at the bigger picture. I really enjoyed this game
B0014YVC6W|5.0|Short Circuit is a fun and entertaining movie. It's great for kids of all ages (even old ones like me).
B004PGO25O|5.0|For anyone trying to create something in the face of self doubt and opposition, you'll find this book to be a nice little kick in the pants. Published by Seth Godin's Domino Project, so very similar in style to Seth's books (punchy, short and sweet).
B004FOA84A|5.0|I'm giving it 5 stars simply because it didn't require permission to my phone calls and gps data. This needs to be encouraged! Pay attention to what you install people...
B004FOA84A|5.0|please make more! great difficulty, graphics, and fun! the music gets a bit repetitive, but its definitely sets the mood. a+ ! evo  keep up the good work.
0811870413|5.0|I have been making sourdough for ~6 months, various breads for 20.  My crust is never great, the bread is dense & crumbly.  I have various recipes that I follow & the results taste good but would NEVER be mistaken for store/bakery bread.  I got this book after going to a friends house & being amazed by his bread.  I read the first 20 pages, got a couple things together, tried first recipe.  That night we all gathered around the amazing bread.  So beautiful, perfect crust, amazing taste.  This book is so well written - it clear explains and then shows in pictures exactly what to do.  Same ingredients I have always used, just totally different (spectacular) result.  I never though I could bake bread this amazing.  I have since given this book as gifts to 3 friends.
B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|The basic plot has been done: ex-agent seeks revenge. It gets the action going nicely. Despite its common beginning, however, 'Hanna' rises well above its genre. Cate Blanchett does a great job in her hard-edge spymaster role. Eric Bana plays a minor part in the drama, however large his part in getting the plot under way. Saoirse Ronan, however, walks away with the title role. Her delicate features and lean grace seem at odds with her vicious role, and the director makes the most of that contradiction. The paradox only builds when Hanna connects with another young girl - the contrast of one girl's chatty, knowing daydreams with the other's gritty and uncertain nightmares might make you look at any girl differently, knowing that both extremes might lie within one young frame.<br /><br />Think of a kitten: cute, yes, but trained by its parents to kill. Hanna is that kind of kitten.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
B004FOA84A|4.0|Would be a five star game but its way too short and has no replay value. I finished it in 30min. and it left me wanting more.
B001UV4XI8|3.0|Disappointed that there are no extras for the regular DVD version in this combo pack (the single disk DVD version that you can buy apparently has no extras either). That means that folks without a Blu-Ray player don't get any extras. That really wasn't clear in the product details and I would probably have just bought the single disk version if I had known.

B000001FTA|4.0|This album is quite a peak for Lizzy in that all of the elements come together  to really show the power of Phillip Lynott, the undisputed leader of this band, and his strength as a great songwriter and lead frontman. Scott Gorham really steps up to the plate here on the guitar duties as Brian Robertson's role within the band was in still in question. He appears on three tracks notably Opium Trail, Killer Without a Cause and with Gorham on That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart. The reason for Robertson's \\"session\\" credit is that months before he had damaged his hand badly in a barfight the night before Lizzy were due to begin a tour of the Americas and it had to be inevitably cancelled leaving him in bad favor with the band and the management. Eventually, he was welcomed back and this recording is an indication of that re-entry. Onto the album. Tony Visconti is debuting as producer for this record which would last through to the next 2 albums that would be remembered as the golden era for Lizzy. Soldier of Fortune opens the record and is a driving, melodic rocker. The title track follows in and has some great drumming from Brian Downey and Lynott shows his vocal abilities within the duration of this tune. Opium Trail is another churner that explains the dangers of Heroin, obviously something Phil was enthralled within enough that it would be instrumental and ultimately detrimental to his health throughout the rest of his existence.     Southbound rolls in and is a pleasant laid back effort that would actually be rendered better in the live setting as evidenced on the scorching version on Live and Dangerous. Dancing in the Moonlight has a boogie rhythm and has saxophone on it courtesy of John Helliwell. A great gem within the Lizzy canon and an interesting live number. Killer Without a Cause is another rocking number that has some light acoustic guitar breaks to give it a counterbalance of the roughness displayed within this \\"killer\\" track. Downtown Sundown is anotherlaid back number that fits in nicely with the overall feel of the record, giving a substance that makes one want to revisit this album again and again. The closing numbers That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart and Dear Lord are strong songs that continue the conceptual continuity within this record. Excellent arrangements and top notch musicianship throughout, Bad Reputation is most definitely one Lizzy's top albums ever. If ya haven't heard this, I don't know where ya been!!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I had the free version on my phone for a while but never actually used it.. saw this and downloaded even without any reviews yet and I'm glad I did!! This will be great in my town here when I'm wishing I could listen to stations from my bigger home city or even when I'm driving my long 8 hours drives through the boonies! I expected it to buffer for long times but nope, it takes like 3 seconds to buffer even when I was switching from station to station to add presets. Happy so far!
B002ZG994U|5.0|As a big A-team fan growing up, I couldn't wait to see this, and I wasn't disappointed.  It's action packed, has some great humorous moments, and completely draws in the viewer.<br /><br />A word of warning--it doesn't even TRY to be realistic.  The characters are larger than life and the action is amazing, but if you are one of those who watch a movie and go \\"that can't really happen,\\" or \\"no way someone could do that,\\" than don't bother with this.  NOTHING in the movie could probably really be done.  But so what?<br /><br />INCREDIBLY fun to watch.  I hope there's a sequel!
B004UOCF3W|5.0|As a fan of this band since I heard 'This is the Call' almost 20 years ago. Since then the Foo Fighters have been one of the most influential and true Rock N' Roll bands out there. Now they present their 7th studio release and it is amazing.<br /><br />If this band isn't true Rock N' Roll the entire album was recorded on analog tape in Dave Grohl's garage...AMAZING! The album as a whole is pure hard hitting, balls to the wall rock. Their first single 'Rope' is one of their most origonal sounding songs with off beat drumwork and hard guitar rifts. The rest of the album with songs like Dear Rosemary, Walk and White Limo, the Foo Fighters never disapoint. What better way to give their fans a treat than to bring Kris Novaselic (who hasn't preformed on bass since 'In Utero') to do bass work on one of the albums' songs.<br /><br />This is a must own for Foo Fighter fans and rock fans as a whole. Those who feel rock is a dying art 'Wasted Light' will make you second guess that. I myself have not enjoyed listening to one their albums this much since 'Colour & Shape'. I will admit it was a hard one to match...but this one comes pretty damn close and at some points in a strait listen, surpasses.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app. is so awesome!  I stream radio from Russia!  it's amazing! the only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that it keeps pausing to buffer :/    but other than that... it's awesome!    and the pro has some extra features compared to the free... so that's cool too :)      just improve the streaming, and it'll be perfect!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I started watching this show out of curiousity and I LOVE IT. People that you think wouldn't like this show are watching! People I work with, we anticipate it every Thursday and come back to work and talk about it! I don't know what it is about this show (perhaps that Damon is a hottie :)) but it's so suspenseful and keeps you wanting more. I loved READING the Twilight books, but I LOVE watching this show. It's a great storyline.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Vivo en apartamento y el comprar amplificador me present&oacute; tres problemas: el espacio a ocupar en mi habitaci&oacute;n y el sonido que pod&iacute;a disfrutar para mis practicas o momentos de ocio y lo m&aacute;s importante: el precio!<br /><br />Sobre el espacio, bueno, podr&aacute;s ver que la rese&ntilde;a y vistas en youtube que es bastante peque&ntilde;o y la verdad es un buen punto fuerte para &eacute;l. El sonido, bueno, no es el \\"mejor\\" pero es muy bueno, tiene como un sonido de radio (exagero un poco) pero posee una muy buena potencia de salida y los efectos se pueden aprovechar muy bien, tan solo digamos que no tiene un sonido profesional. Y por &uacute;ltimo el precio: amigo (a) vale la pena la compra, en serio, es port&aacute;til, con buen poder de salida y muy barato, es incluso buena compra en caso de tener amplificador, cabe perfectamente el case de tu guitarra y sabemos todos el problemas de log&iacute;stica que presenta llevar una guitarra en su case (nada liviano) junto al amplificador (generalmente impr&aacute;ctico para movilizar) por lo que lo obtuve sin problemas y estoy muy contento con la compra.<br /><br />Consejo: si usas aud&iacute;fonos, recomendar&iacute;a unos inal&aacute;mbricos, no tengo unos, pero el cordel de los mios tiende a molestar en mis practicas diarias.

B004FOA84A|5.0|if u like puzzle games, like resident evil, u will love this game. really a lot of fun. i hope they have sequels, i thoroughly enjoyed this game...... we want more!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a great adventure type point and click game, which was a blast to play, the only downfall as others have said is it is way short. You should be able to finish it in under an hour. Hope there is a sequel!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Fantastic app. Huge selection of stations both am and fm. Best part is no headset needed. Listening right now and loving the great quality. Highly recommended.
9562913686|5.0|Here are some of the GEMS I found in this book. There is a lot more then this :)<br /><br />The Power of Your Subconscious Mind<br /><br />Remember it is the world within, namely, your thoughts feelings and imagery that makes your world without.<br /><br />Never finish a negative statement, reverse it immediately, and wonders will happen in your life.<br /><br />Whatever you claim mentally and feel as true, your subconscious mind will accept and bring forth into your experience. The only thing necessary for you to do is to get your subconscious mind to accept your idea.<br /><br />When thoughts are conveyed to your subconscious mind, impressions are made in the brain cells. As soon as you're subconscious accepts any idea, if proceeds to put it into effect immediately.<br /><br />They have shown repeatedly that your subconscious mind will accept any suggestion, however false. Having once accepted any suggestion, it responds accordingly to the nature of suggestion given.<br /><br />Check regularly on negative suggestions that people make to you. You do not have to be influenced by destructive suggestions. Do not let others do your thinking for you. Choose your own thoughts and make your own decisions.<br /><br />Whatever the conscious, reasoning mind believes; the subconscious mind will accept and act upon. Never say I CAN'T<br /><br />We injure ourselves by the negative ideas, which we entertain. How often have you wounded yourself by getting angry, fearful, jealous, or vengeful? These are the poisons that enter your subconscious mind.<br /><br />According to your belief is it done unto you! Faith is, in a sense, accepting as true what your reason and senses deny.<br /><br />Faith produces miracles; and whether it is true or false faith, it will always produces the same wonders.<br /><br />Imagine the end desired and feel its reality; then infinite life principle will respond to your conscious choice in your conscious request.<br /><br />Your subconscious speaks to you in intuitions, impulses, hunches, intimations, urges, and ideas.<br /><br />You are the sum total of your own thoughts.<br /><br />New idea must be felt subjectively in a finished state, not the future, but as idea coming about now.<br /><br />To believe is to accept something as true, or to live in the state of being it.<br />Your subconscious is always controlled by the dominant idea. Your subconscious will accept the stronger of two contradictory propositions.<br /><br />To avoid all conflict between your desires and imagination by entering into a drowsy, sleepy state this brings all effort to a minimum. The conscious mind is submerged to a great extent when is the sleepy state. The best time to impregnate your subconscious is prior to sleep.<br /><br />Repeat about five minutes to yourself three or four times a day. \\"Wealth - Success\\" these words have a tremendous power.<br /><br />There is no conflict in the mind when you say, \\"Wealth.\\" Furthermore, the feeling of wealth will well up within you as you dwell on the idea of wealth. The feeling of wealth produces wealth; keep this in mind at all times. Envy and jealousy are stumbling blocks to the flow of wealth. Rejoice in the prosperity of others.<br /><br />Repeat often:<br />I am one with limitless riches of my subconscious mind. It is my right to be rich, happy, and successful. Money flows to me freely, abundantly, and endlessly. I am forever conscious of my true worth. I give of my talents freely, and I am wonderfully blessed financially. It is wonderful.<br /><br />Awakes to the simple truth that it is never what a person says or does that affects you.  It is your reaction to what is said or done that matters. Criticism cannot hurt you without your consent.<br /><br />You cannot be hurt when you know that you are the master of your thoughts, reactions, and emotions. Emotions follow thoughts, and you have the power to reject all thoughts, which may disturb or upset you.<br /><br />This is just some of thegood points. This is a must read for anyone that wants to change or improve their life.<br /><br />Thanks Ralph

0684801558|5.0|When I finished reading this book, I felt conflicted and a little confused about whether I liked it or not. An inner dialogue ran thus: \\"What?\\".    I understand the impatience that some may feel for the rambling tone of the book. I have left many a book unread for just that reason. However, this one kept me going back for more. Knowing FSF, I was fairly certain it wouldn't lead to a predictable conclusion, but that didn't mean it would lead to a good one.     Though I knew the title, I hadn't really ever heard much about this book before. I think I understand why now, it is definitely not one to be cubby-holed.    If you are a moralist, you may be outraged at the end. If you are a keen observer of humanity and know how floppy we all really are, you'll understand and laugh at how the author ended it. I know I did, once I got over being nonplussed.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Excellent app.  Dude that gave it 1 star based soley on permissions needs head back to his bunker and wait quietly for whatever schizos wait for.  This is a cool app, and it picked up all the local stations here in san antonio.  Works great so far on my Gtab.  Listening to 99.5 kiss as i type this......Winning!!!
B004PGO25O|5.0|I've already read the book \\"The War of Art\\" and this book is still fantastic to me.  I put down my kindle, then got to work.  Short, to the point, and INCREDIBLY powerful motivator.  Read it right now, then pass it on to everyone you know whether they are creatives or not.  Everybody has a dream, large or tiny.  The only difference is that some people slay the dragon of resistance and others give in.  I'm done giving in.
B004FOA84A|5.0|very fun but I wish there was more. reminds me of mist.  really would love it to be longer though. would pay 2 or 3 dollars for longer version.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|The first ever lesbian film that I bought was Claire of the Moon..( same writer/ Nicole Conn)   Not that many great ones at that time..and we must have looked at the love scene 100 times..It will be the same with the ''passionate longest kiss '' from Elena Undone. Again, great movie, where we can see the passion/attraction growing between the 2 main characters, even if they're fighting against it.   Love can move mountains!  Nicely directed, great scenario, great actresses. A great addition to a dvd collection!
142313494X|5.0|- I'm Harry Potter fan , but i so enjoyed the Percy Jackson Series so much. I couldn't put the book down and couldn't wait for the next one. If you like adventure, you will like this book.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Alright, first of all, it comes with a piece of \\"recording tape\\" letting you know right off, when you go to look in the liner notes when it falls out to the floor (tape) that they went back to basics.  There isn't a crap song on here.  It's got the grit and grime you'd expect from Grohl and company and the solidness that the band brings with it each time they play.    I was let down with the last couple of recording efforts they've been putting out, but for that foo fanatic.... the wait is OVER!    I said it earlier but i'll say it agin....     SOLID FROM FRONT TO BACK!!!  100%!!!
B004LP601S|5.0|It's a personal review, personal taste is not up for debate, this is not a forum after all. You like it, then like it, you hate it then hate it, but I love it, period!    I got it with the 6 bonus tracks (Stall me, Oh Glory, I wanna be free, Turn off the lights, Bittersweet and Kaleidoscope Eyes), some of the bonus songs, I'd say great, if not better than most of the song on the 10 tracks.    Even my least fav songs on it, I'd still give it 3.5 stars. Over all, with all 16 songs, it's 5 stars for me.    This one goes back to, more like the 1st album AFYCSO. 2nd one PO was too different, it turned me off at first because I was still in mood of wanting more AFYCSO style of songs.  I'd say you have to be in a different mood to like PO.      I can't say they sounded just like FOB, cuz I can't get into FOB, PW's voice just doesn't do it for me like BU's vocal does.  And as for the split, I don't take side, I'd say the band were great when they were together, and it's still great to me after the split. I checked out all the song posted on Young Veins' myspace page, couldn't get into it, RR's vocal doesn't do it for me neither did the style of music.  RR's very talented, again, it's a personal taste thing when it comes to music style.    For me, if I love the artist's vocal, it doesn't matter what they sing, I would still love it, even if it's a potty song while they are sitting on the can.     I'd say enjoy it as it is, if you wanna compare it with other band or artist, you'll never realize how good it is.  Sometime you feel like a nut some time you don't, don't be comparing the one with nut to the one without the nut.
B004FOA84A|4.0|twice had a force close issue when starting app...no biggie. just restarted and worked fine. droid x. great fun classic way to waste an hour. no reply value but i had fun playing it!
B001EN71DG|5.0|This Star Wars trilogy pack contains 2 discs for every movie. One is the special edition version, and the bonus disc contains the original movie release.  As an old timer who liked the unaltered version (just like someone who does not like the remix of a song) I am very pleased.    The only thing I regret is that the spanish dubbing of the original is not the neutral latin one. The spanish version has accent from Spain, which is very distracting.  Spain has a population of about 40 million while Latin America has the same amount of population of the US.  So it is like making an english dubbing with Australian accent, quite weird.  On top of that, Spanish people use different words than the rest of spanish speaker public.  In US, the latino public is not likely to use words used by people from Spain, they just feel unnatural.    The old original spanish dubbing (made in Latin America) for episode IV was incredible as it indeed improved the original voices of Vader, Leia and pilot speech during Death Star dogfight.  I missed this dubbing a lot.    In the spanish dubbing for special edition of episode VI, the voices of EV-9D9 droid and Boushh Leia sound REALLY crappy, like a cheap home made scifi movie. Reducing costs?  This is a great way to scam Lucas and his audience.    I give this pack 5 stars for it is a great thing to have the original release. I can feel joy watching the original movie with english voices.  But as far as it goes to spanish dubbing, it is not so good.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The Name of the Wind is on just about every \\"best of 2007' list ever, and deservedly so.<br /><br />If you haven't read it yet, do it. Now. I'll wait...<br /><br />All done? Great book, isn't it!<br /><br />Everything about The Name of the Wind is wonderful, except one thing: with one minor exception (Devi), none of the female characters are independent. They are all defined in terms of male characters and they all depend--usually heavily--on male characters. This might be because the main story takes Kvothe's POV as a teenage boy, so women are a mystery to him. Besides that, he's more interested in talking about himself. Nonetheless, I was disappointed that there wasn't a single female, not even at the University, who could stand on her own two feet. Maybe one character (Devi), but she was more of a plot device than a character. In this book, she exists to keep the pressure on Kvothe to make money.<br /><br />That said, I can't come up with enough superlatives to describe everything else in the book. Kvothe's character rings true, the world is intricate and detailed, the dialogue is fresh (I detected a few Whedonic constructs), the action is exciting, and you're always left wondering if the guy can possibly top his last adventure. Then he does. Again and again. The best thing about the book is that it is so poetic. I mean, there are actually places in the book where Rothfuss uses meter and rhyme in the prose to make an impact. That's rare, and it's even rarer to see it done well. Not only is Rothfuss a masterful storyteller, but he also knows how to wield language powerfully.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss also has an awesome blog at [...]<br /><br />Oh, and if you didn't stop a couple paragraphs ago to read the book, please do so now.
B004FOA84A|4.0|works great on HTC EVO 4g.   can not install on SD card. it was fun but a little short.  never had a problem with it.
0451228375|4.0|Better than the first one.  It seems as if the the true history plays an even smaller role and the characters a larger one.  Still engaging.  I did find the very end to be a little over the top, but it did not ruin the story for me.
B000KP62MA|5.0|I really enjoy this cd and dvd. I am huge fan and I recommand it to any 30StM fan.I definitely like the way the booklet is made.The Dvd is also very high quality and even the quantity. If you dont have the original Cd this one is way better. For a fan it is a must have.
B004PGO25O|5.0|The new Pressfield hits hard, direct and to the point. My first time through, he made me cry. My second time through, he made me think why I cried again. My third time through, he made me make a life decision. Thank you for this book.
0345522478|4.0|This book is an enjoyable start to a planned trilogy to be released over the coming months.  It was a fairly short, quick read.  The author does not dawdle in introducing his main character, Atticus, a 2000 year old Druid posing as a 21 year old bookstore owner living in Arizona, and his backstory.  Atticus is hiding in Arizona from Aenghus Óg, the Celtic god of love who is not a particularly loving god.      The story is steeped in Celtic mythology and Irish culture.  As far as urban fantasy goes, Hounded ranks pretty high on the list.  There is plenty of action, both martial and magical.  There are werewolves and vampires, gods and goddesses, and witches and fae, and the author puts his unique spin on them all.  The main character's lawyers are as sharp as their teeth (being fittingly cast as werewolves and vampires), and provide a number of services not normally provided by your average law firm (i.e., providing assistance in battling a horde of Fir Bolgs and cleaning up the aftermath with a ghoul cleanup service).    This book has already garnered a lot of positive reviews so I am not sure what else I can add.  Here is what I liked about the book:  1.  Lots of action in relatively few pages;  2.  Humorous style of writing (the interaction of the main character with his wolfhound and an Irish widow down the street provides most of the comic relief); and   3.  not too much sex and no romance (in my opinion the romance in a lot of urban fantasy drowns out the story).    I can't really point to any significant negatives about this book.  It was fairly short, and the finale wrapped up quickly.  I strongly recommend this book as a light, fun read, and I eagerly look forward to the sequel.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The Pro version of TuneIn makes for a great addition to any radio lover's app collection. one of my favorite features is the ability to record a session and play it back later.
B002K9CVZ6|5.0|The title is Born To Run.  The subtitle mentions athletes and races.  The best indication is that, yes, this book WOULD appeal more to someone interested in running than someone who was not.    With that said, McDougall spins an epic tale-- so fantastic that I felt the need to do independent research to verify his facts. Names, dates, races all checked out. He also includes a lot of great running physiology. You will be surprised and inspired when you hear what your body was actually built to do. I'll give you a hint; it's all in the title.  McDougall's greatest gift, though, is an attitude shift. Most of us mere humans hate to run. If we do it at all, we run in order to look good or to support other parts of our lifestyle.  McDougall says that he set out, not to be a better runner, but to actually enjoy running.  Apparently he achieved his goal. I believe that, if you read this book, you will learn how to enjoy the act of running as well. I know I did.  Thanks Chris.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|i listen to itune radio free version everyday.  some days it works and some days it doesn't.   iTune Radio Pro works every time and i wouldn't trade it for any other radio app.  so if you are hesitant because you have been using the free version - download this...IT'S GREAT
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a very fun puzzle adventure game. Short, sure, but totally worth it. Especially being free today. Graphics and gameplay are spot on. More variety in music might be nice. Level of challenge perfect, but may be a bit steep for users that are new to this genre. Check it out! Can't wait for new chapters.
B00316DDWW|5.0|After hearing Themata about 30 times (ok, maybe more).. it was pretty much a given that Sound Awake would be in my collection. The only thing I was worried about after hearing these 30 second clips, was that the band had stayed the course with Themata.    On my first 2 or 3 listens, I was a feeling so-so about this CD, but continued to give it time to set its own ground. As much as I like this CD, it could have been the 2nd CD in a dual CD with Themata. Much like Led Zep's Physical Graffiti.. great music, yet the spread across 2 discs.     Don't get me wrong, all of the songs on SA are very good, and honestly, I am not at all disappointed in my purchase. I think this CD would be welcomed as much as Themata was, had I not heard Themata 1st. I'm not sure if the guys in Karnivool wanted to keep 'a good thing going', or the producers demanded that.. but nonetheless, it worked out OK (not great, but OK). I did not dock any stars from this CD, because it IS worthy of 5 stars, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of music.
B003UMW66G|5.0|Just as I remembered it, Hero is one of the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous fantasy pictures ever made. Yimou Zhang's direction is exceptional, with breathless landscapes, intense perspectives and seamless action scenes that manage to shine coherently despite the frequent jump cuts. The film's rich sequence of colors gives each act a distinct, easily identifiable tone and flavor, which is naturally the most pronounced aspect most admirers will remember. What took me by surprise with this viewing, though, was how integral the audio was. Every action in each fantastic fight scene is matched by a subtle, but perfect, sound effect that hammers home the precision and power of each stomp, leap or swing. An ambitious visual feat that delivers in spades, it also carries a poignant, timeless message about the necessity and ultimate intentions of war.
0761158820|5.0|I can think of no better way to spend time with my son. We each pick a monster and sit down with our glue. My 12-year-old son loves Legos and this toy is a wonderful extension of that skill set. Some of the monsters are a bit tedious, but it's fun to read about the character traits of each papertoy as you wait a minute for the glue to dry. You'll be wowed by the creativity of the artists and the diversity of the creatures. Warning: making monsters is addictive.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|They're all too self absorbed rubbing their wealth and cultural insensitivity in our faces.  The best parts of the movie and the only two thing that stopped me from giving this piece of dreck only one star were Alice Eve's unrestrained breasteses and Liza Minnelli doing her thing.  Other than that they are ALL spoiled, self indulgent, rude and why does Cynthia Nixon always look like she's got green teeth?
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I really like the product, especially for the price. I got this along with a set of Sennheiser HD 555's, and it does a decent job of powering them.<br /><br />The only issue is like others have mentioned: there is a small - yet distinguishable - buzz or whine when set at high volume. It is a small noise, but during lulls in songs played at high volume it is noticeable. Only worth docking one star. For $20 it is hard to beat.<br /><br />I think the for the future I will build a CMOY amp inside an altoids tin, or something classy that. Having to use a 1/4\\" to 1/8\\" adapter for my Sennheiser's is really annoying sometimes.

0307887960|3.0|I have to say I've struggled with writing a review of this book - which is essentially also a product, wondering if it is fair to evaluate it without DOING IT?  I was quite excited to get the book, as I'd heard about the Dukan Diet and even had it in my Amazon cart to purchase. The basic premise as described on the internet and in reviews sounded promising to me - hey, I'm a carnivore!  Meat seven ways to Sunday!  The book and plan are a little more complicated that that, however. Unlike Dr. Atkins, Dr. Dukan is a fatphobe.  No, he's not afraid of fat people, but he doesn't want you to eat much fat - if any - while you're using his diet. So lean, lean meat. No cheese. No chicken breasts sauted in garlic butter as Atkins would allow. The relatively few vegetables allowed are, as to be expected, low-glycmic index ones. Salad ingredients (only fat-free dressing with no carbs, though), green beans, etc. Looking at the list of allowable foods I suddenly felt a little panicked because there were only three of those allowed vegetables I eat: tomatoes, lettuce, green beans. Lettuce and tomato with no blue cheese dressing and grated cheese. It's just wrong.<br /><br />So I haven't tried it yet. It appeals to me on one level, except for the no cheese and no cream in my coffee part. To be fair, the strictest part is the start, which is only 2-11 days long.  Just lean meat. And an oat bran pancake - for fiber, I guess. After that initial phase or step, those limited veggies are added in moderation. After you've lost the weight you want to lose, you start adding back a few more carbs such as bread, rice, potatoes, weighing frequently to make sure you don't start gaining. Then phase four is the rest of your life, watching carbs and fat, and having a totally meat day once a week. He suggests every Thursday.<br /><br />I believe in the basic premise of this book, it will just take some preparation and planning to pull it off. If I try it I'll update this review. Almost nothing would please me more than to report back that I'd found the secret to effortless, permanent weight loss!d please me more than to report back that I'd found the secret to effortless, permanent weight loss!

B004PGO25O|5.0|I'm finding it difficult to write a concise review because there is a lot to say. I loved this book, and I would enjoy discussing it with people who didn't. Most of the complaints seem to be that not planning is a dumb way to do a project if you want to succeed, but those critics seem to have missed the point that doing the project at all is succeeding. It's not about making money or getting famous, it's about following through on your passions. If you want to write then write, if you want to make music then make music. If you want to save the world then save it. Consider; if a lack of planning on a project (even though the author advocates reflection frequently, just not in the very early stages) leads you to fail it is still a superior outcome then you would have if you hadn't started at all. By failing you've lived life instead of just observing it.     I could go on, and I'd love to, but there's work to be done.    Read the book or don't, but do the work.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Works great on my samsung epic. Wish it was longer; was so addicting I played it in one sitting! Some of the puzzles were very easy, but still entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved book 1-but thought Book 2 and 3 were far less enjoyable. Found my self skimming book 3 just to get to end. Thought readibility and freshenss was lacking in book 2 and 3. Seems ratings for most readers went down with each edition. Could easily have gone to 2 stars
142334216X|5.0|Smart is the new cool.<br /><br />Shadowfever is the fifth and final novel in Karen Marie Moning's Fever series. Readers will be pleased that it's longer than the previous books, yet still chock full of plot.<br /><br />After the horrific cliffhanger at the end of the previous book, Dreamfever, we find out that things are pretty bad for Mac -- worse, in fact, than they were at the beginning of Dreamfever. Much of Shadowfever is emotionally draining as Mac deals with grief and starts to become harder and tougher. The result is a young woman who doesn't quite know who she is. This change is painful to watch, yet it's not unwelcome, and sometimes it's amusing (now she's likely to be wearing a semi-automatic weapon strapped across her pink Juicy shirt).<br /><br />There's also much joy in this final novel, and Moning brings everything together into a complex and satisfying conclusion. There are a lot of new revelations in Shadowfever, some that I saw coming (though none were so obvious that I was certain about them), others that truly surprised me, and a couple that I thought were slightly unbelievable (but I didn't really care). Thus, like the previous installments, Shadowfever was a quick read that kept me on the edge of my seat -- a place I like to be when I'm reading a book.<br /><br />I don't read much romantic urban fantasy because I usually think that the sex and romance overshadow the plot, but Moning's Fever series is the best romantic urban fantasy series I've read. It's got a complex twisty plot, a wonderful setting (I can't wait to visit Dublin someday!), great characters, mystery, a pleasant writing style, and plenty of tension-relieving humor. What I liked most, though, was Mac herself. She's a smart and strong heroine (though she doesn't know it) who I can understand. She's sweet and self-confident, sassy but not snarky, and she knows she's in way over her head. She admires the alpha male and is strong enough to resist being pushed around by him, but she has her own goals and realizes his value as a tool to reach those goals. I found their behaviors and relationship to be believable and was pleased that the series didn't devolve into a sap-and-sex story. (There is a lot of sex in the last two books, but it's an integral part of the plot.) I'm glad that I started Fever after the final book was published because I flew through them in a few weeks and would have been seriously disgruntled about those nasty cliffhangers if I'd had to wait.<br /><br />This is a great series to read on audio, but be warned that the narrator changes after book 3. I was so absorbed in the story that this change was a bit upsetting, but I adjusted. The narration on the first three books (Joyce Bean) was excellent -- I especially liked Ms. Bean's male voices. In the last two books, Natalie Ross reads Mac's parts perfectly. Phil Gigante's male voices were sometimes over-the-top in the fourth book, but they seemed more appropriate in the final dramatic volume.<br /><br />If you're a fan of urban fantasy and you haven't read Fever yet, you're missing out!is value as a tool to reach those goals.

1416955070|5.0|I try to read all the books my teenage daughter reads. I saw this on her shelf, picked it up, and had a hard time putting it down. I have read a lot of YA fiction, plus other fiction (I am a huge fan of the Outlander series), and this story was very entertaining. Yes, folks, entertaining, which is how fictional stories are designed to be. If you want/like a good story, take the time to read it. If you want a literary classic, pick up Moby Dick. I found the sequel very good as well. (I haven't read the third or fourth yet, but they are on my list). Enjoy. Mrs. Smith

0553386794|5.0|Like many, I was only introduced to this wonderful book (and the rest of the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series) from the also superb HBO TV series.  I started reading the book a couple weeks before the TV show began, and I am completely hooked on the novels.  Game of Thrones is nothing short of a sublime read that is intricate, intelligent, and epic all in one.  I thought I had given up reading fantasy novels years ago, but now with this series, my interest has been completely renewed.  There are so many well-developed and interesting characters here it is near impossible to choose a favorite, but needless to say \\"The Imp\\" is definitely one of mine!
B004FOA84A|1.0|never got to open it, it just continually force closed. it's a real shame, since it looks interesting. glad i didnt pay for it
1400079144|3.0|I am no book expert and easily entertained.  I don't read books like this to be educated or enlightened.  My 3 star rating to me means I have no regrets having read it as through a good part book I was engaged.  I saw someone say it was only a third of the book was fast paced, I would give it half the book but that can be said for a lot of books I think.  If the Da Vinci code is a 5 star, then I think a 3 star for this book is fair (I would also give A&D a 4).  If another Dan Brown book is in the works I know I will buy it.

B004132HZS|4.0|Sherlock Holmes in the 21st Century. This BBC Series (made in conjunction with the Masterpiece folks) has only three episodes, plus the pilot (which is a shorter and slightly different version of the first episode, \\"A Study in Pink\\".    I've always been a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, going all the way back to the stories by Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle. When I watched this series, I was thrilled. Not only had the BBC managed to successfully transport the famous detective all the way to the 21st century with all its electronic wizardry, but they managed to capture his personality, as well. Holmes is basically bored with life and wants nothing more than a challenging case to solve. John Watson is a war veteran (returned from a stint in Afghanistan, where he was wounded) who is now living on a military pension. A mutual friend introduces the two in the first story, A Study in Pink, and they rent a flat at 221B Baker Street.    Several important distinctions about the series needs to be noted. Unlike the stories by Doyle, we are shown what Holmes is thinking and his analytical process. Watson isn't the bumbling acquaintance, but an important part in Holmes' life and in helping solve the mysteries. In at least one instance, Watson saves Holmes' life, the revelation of which could means that Watson would face a murder charge.    The police inspector is sharp, but dependent upon Holmes to help him solve difficult cases. Sometimes, Holmes own personal case puts the inspector's on the back burner, but that's okay. To reveal more would be spoil the nature of the story (and I won't tell you which episode this happens in, either.    The series stories all develop the arch-enemy to one degree or another. There are, naturally, some red herrings along the way, but that just adds to the entertainment value. The real key is that by the time the case is solved, we know what Holmes knows and that is refreshing from the typical Conan Doyle approach of not revealing anything to the reader (onin the case of many of the older movies, the viewer) until Holmes relates how he solves the case. But in this series, we know what is going on and are not left in the dark. What is fantastic about this one is that if Holmes is stumped, we are stumped. If he is on to something, we are on to something. It really is masterfully written and a lot of fun to watch.    The first two stories are absolutely delicious and I was enthralled with how well written and executed they were. Sadly, the last episode was not nearly as good as the first two, which knocked the series as a whole down one star to four. Had the last episode been as sharply written (the performances are always top-notch, so it was the story that suffered) I wouldn't have hesitated giving this series five stars.    The pilot (also A Study in Pink) should be watched first, mostly because the techniques used to produce the series change slightly for the series. I'm not sure which I actually preferred, as the plot line remains the same, but the execution of the story itself is different.    Now, if only the BBC will continue to produce more of these outstanding Sherlock episodes.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|Here we have George, with indispensable assistance from the oft' maligned Jeff Lynne, generating the kind of pop with punch that had gone missing from George's work for some time. While this IS an album one can listen thru start-to-finish without wincing, George better songs sound oh-SO-much better when juxtaposed with equally-Beatlesworthy output from John, Paul and Ringo...as nature intended. Yes, nature was indeed thwarted as of 1970. But in retrospect--it doesn't have to be that way. After all, the music was THE thing, as John said later of the Beatles, and now fans don't have to wait for the record companies to catch up. Fans can re-create a real-life Beatles world of 1970-2010 right now.

0061564893|5.0|I picked this book up only because the title looked so devilishly interesting. Once I opened it, I discovered that to say that it was devilishly interesting was an understatement. The author, an ex-submariner and lover of cartography, (and also a captivating writer) apparently had stumbled upon some maps in a Portuguese archive that he took to have worldwide implications. Following his hunches to their logical conclusions like any good researcher would do, he fell thorough an \\"Alice in Wonderland like hole,\\" all led by the discovery of cartographic ship charts inexplicably residing deep within the cavities of the Portuguese archives.<br /><br />The \\"catch\\" is that these charts were found in the archives of one of the preeminent Western maritime powers dated long before Westerner explorers had set sail to discover the \\"New World?\\" The questions that this author's findings and research beg are obvious and are unending: Where did Portugal get these charts? Were they subsequently used by Magellan and other mariners like Columbus for instance to guide them in the discovery of the New World? How accurate were they? Who put them in the Archives?<br /><br />In a historical detective story for the times, what this author's research would do if left unchallenged (or should it prove to be true despite challenges) is no less than overturn a great deal of settled Western history of exploration and discovery, including who was the first to discover America. What Mr. Menzies claims to have discovered independently is that by the 15th century, China was not only unquestionably the most powerful political and economic entity on Earth, but also was far and away its most powerful maritime power and international global trading partner of at least 30 nations around the world. In fact, most of this is uncontested World and Chinese history.<br /><br />What has now been hotly contested in historical circles is the author's contention that the cartographic charts are strong prima facie evidence that his story is true: That the grandson of the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty (Zhu Di) did in fact set sail in 1421 a  flotilla of a dozen of the world's largest ships, all totaling around 9,000 men. They spread out across the seas headed to the four corners of the globe to chart the unknown world in search of treasures for their Emperor.<br /><br />The problem with the author's well-told and captivating story is that two years later, Zhu Di was deposed; the forbidden city sacked; and all records of the supposed exploratory adventure burned and destroyed? Thus, is Mr. Menzies story just a fanciful one, part history; part creative fiction, and nothing more? Or is there enough truth in his thesis that more research needs to be done to either refute or validate his claims?<br /><br />Mainstream historian at the time the book hit the best sellers list in 2002, descended upon him like a swarm of locusts, calling him and his book a fraud and worse. And while the historical firestorm it raised continues unabated, I must say it makes good reading even if it most likely will turn out to be either untrue, or impossible to validate. Curiously, in an era when our standards of historical research should be improving, we see things like the Da Vinci Code, etc. gaining ascendancy. Is this book just another part of this unhealthy trend? I am not a Historian, but I am pulling for the author to be able to validate his central claims. It does not sound like a scam to me, but I will be keeping my eyes on how support for his story unfolds. Easily five stars.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is great. Not only can I listen to radio stations across the country but I can also search for specific talk shows and it will give me a list of stations that are currently playing them.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I stopped updating this app when they requested to start at boot, record my phone number, location, and full internet access.  Why would they want ALL that? It's not for just streaming audio.
B004PGO25O|1.0|This book is a product of its time. It's a product of Nike's \\"just do it\\" campaign. It is the product of baby-boom and post baby-boom unbounded self indulgence. It is a product of Disney's \\"all of our dreams can come true if only we believe in them.\\" It is a product of American anti-rationalism (\\"rational thought is the artist or entrepreneur's worst enemy.\\"). It is the product of the New Age, perhaps Star Wars, where thought and understanding are evils and some nebulous, perhaps external inspiration is good. It is a product of wishful thinking, considering attributes such as stupidity, stubbornness, and blind faith to be virtues.     In short, this book is the embodiment of the Oprah culture.    This is unfortunate. The author actually has some good ideas. He promotes stepwise refinement and encourages the reader to continue advance consistently. He argues against excessive research and planning, which can indeed bog down projects, though he argues pretty much against any planning. He encourages to be watchful of those things which will get in the way. But the first few sections left me feeling like I was covered in a sickly treacle, and I couldn't do more than to skim the rest to see if there was anything worthwhile. There wasn't.    At least it was free on Kindle.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a fun game to pass the time, but it was short.  I wish it had more levels to play. The graphics were great especially considering it was a cell phone app.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  The account of Jill's stroke, of what it felt like to be in her body during that time, had  me so intrigued!  It was hard to put the book down at times.  I've always been interested in brain research and function.    It was amazing to read about it from a brain expert's point-of-view.  It also actually brought me some peace thinking about loved  ones who have had strokes... just knowing that there are some positive emotions, feelings, sensations that can happen when a stroke occurs.  And I loved her explanations of her experiences with others who came to visit her, or those who cared for her-   the energy that each person carried with them, and the impact it had on her healing.  I like the idea of taking responsibility for the energy each of of us emits when we interact with others.    And of learning to live with more balance between the brain hemispheres... bringing in the right brain's strengths and   letting go of the left brain ego and (sometimes) judgmental side.  How uplifting.  Finally, I love Jill's message of hope and love, and of the brain's amazing capacity, adaptation, and healing -- its plasticity.    I checked this book out from our library, and then bought if from amazon because I wanted my own copy.  Now I'm lending   it out to many others in my family.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Cute little game, but literally 2 hour game TOPS more like 1 really - with no replay value.  Fund for a free download, but not really worth a $.

B0018QCXGY|5.0|I'll keep it simple.    The movie has a lot of suspense, likeable characters, mystery, and a really cool monster with great effects.    Sure not all questions are answered but that's the point. Best monster movie I have ever seen and well worth a purchase if you can enjoy it for what it is.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I can't say enough about this book, this character or this writer.  I've read all of his work and they never disappoint.  Reacher is the ultimate tough-as-nails rebel and he always has a cause.  A good one.  But this is where it all started for me.  I've been hooked from book 1.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I won't get into the story because if you're looking to buy it you probably have already seen it and loved it. It's not for everybody but for those who liked it, they usually really liked it.    The special features are what make the movie. With all the extended and deleted scenes added in it brings the movie to a 3 hour and 8 minute runtime. Well worth a purchase if you loved the movie as I did and want to relive it with a bunch of new scenes and features.
B004FOA84A|2.0|This game is way too short. I would not pay for  this app. It would be great if there were like 3 times longer. Then I would pay for it.

I love Scott Cann as Dano, and love the way he got his nick-name.  Daniel Day Kim and Grace Park and fabulous in their parts.  You have to see this show.  It is exciting and keeps you on your toes and touches your heart as well.  It is now one my favorites that I WILL NOT MISS!  Way to go guys.  Thanks for giving us such a wonderful show!  I can't say enough good things about it.  I cannot wait until the DVD comes out!!  GOD BLESS YOU!!

B004RJZA1E|4.0|To start, I don't think this band sounds quite like how they classify themselves as: Power/melodic death metal. They have the \\"power/melodic\\" and \\"metal\\" bit down, but the only thing remotely \\"death\\" in this music is the screaming vocals of one of the three singers, Andy. Yes, Amaranthe has three singers and I, personally, really love the dynamic it creates. As mentioned, Andy does solely scream vocals, Jake sounds a bit like a modern-day 80's vocalist with a nice tone to his voice, and Elize sounds something like taking a really talented mainstream pop female singer and plopping her in a progressive power metal band. Admittedly, it took me a couple of listens for Elize's vocals to truly sink in for me in this dynamic, but only because of her place in the music. As a singer, she is fantastic -- and it certainly doesn't hurt the band's effort that she easily ranks alongside the likes of Cristina Scabbia, Simone Simons, etc. in the arena of being easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Musically, there's a lot going on here. I would almost say it's comparative to The Agonist where instrumentation is concerned (that is to say, certainly not comparative at all vocally), but not *quite* as heavy. There is plenty of groove to be found on this album, which I find to be a key element to enjoying bands in this genre. I grew tired of the power metal genre a LONG time ago, so it was very refreshing to hear this band come along and show me that there are some out there shifting the genre. All of the musicians on this album are great with their respective instruments, so there's certainly no lack of talent or songwriting abilities.<br /><br />If you're into a very narrow scope of metal and you're not really looking to step outside of your boundaries and give something new a try, you probably won't like this album. However, if you are a music aficionado and looking for something that sounds different and appeals to various schools of listening/musicality, I think you will enjoy them. Head over to YouTube, search for \\"Amaranthe Hunger\\" (without quotes), and have a listen to see what you think. If you dig it, then you pretty much know what you're in for if you decide to purchase the album.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this album 4 stars because it loses my attention as a listener at times throughout the progression of the album, but those times are short-lived and far and few between. Also, I reserve 5 stars these days for albums I can play consecutively in one sitting. Unfortunately, every time I reach the end of this album, I find myself looking for something else to listen to. However, I can come back to it the next day and enjoy another spin of the album.<br /><br />-Stephensearch for \\"Amaranthe Hunger\\" (without quotes), and have a listen to see what you think.

After that I just connect my phone to the charger (it's power is less than 15%) and launch it, it WORKs. So I disconnect the charger, close it and open it again. It works again. Is it my battery's problem? Or need to connect the charger at the first time launch?  My phone is HTC Desire.    By the way, you can not move it to SD card even you connect you charger.

0470449748|3.0|This book can be very useful but also can be overwhelming. I would suggest use of this book after a base is established in terms of one's handle on the GMAT. A good starter book would be the Kaplan GMAT Prep book. Provides a lot of good strategy tips in addition to problems with answers and explanations in the back.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|OMG! Does it get any better than this app! It is so easily accessible, works great, and is very diverse. The multi-tasking is a very big plus.  I have spent a good portion of the day moving around this app, checking out all I can do and listening to both the national and local radio stations. It has my favorite local stations.  I am seriously considering replacing my sirus radio now. This app totally rocks over i heart radio! I have already been notifying friends to go to Amazon and purchase TuneIn Radio Pro.  Congratulations Amazon on getting this fantastic app which certainly deserves a 5 star rating and kudos on the new Amazon Apps Store.

B002KYHZLQ|5.0|You know if you like fantasty books. I tried broadening my reading base to include modern non-fiction, classical literature, or historical fiction and I always come back to fantasy. This book satisfied my craving quite nicely. I'm listening to the first book of A Song of Fire and Ice, and so far I like Erikson's Gardens of the Moon better.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I am a HUGE Foo fan, saw them in concert a bunch of times, own everything they ever released (even the bootleg stuff)...and after a week and a half of listening to this CD non-stop, I have to say this is by far the best thing Foo Fighters have ever released. I laugh at some reviews (here and on other sites) that are complaining about the Foo sound, the mixing, and how some reviews hate certain songs and love others, and others are totally reversed.  People love to complain about everything...I will start by saying I think the sound is AMAZING.  Someone compared it to Metallica's Death Magnetic, and they couldnt be 100% wrong, Death Magnetic was mixed horribley and sounds like garbage.  Wasting Light is the best sounding CD I have heard in years.  Now for the songs:    Bridge Burning - 5 out of 5 - Great way to start tyhe CD...Loud, heavy, great riff, great chorus    Rope - 3 out of 5 - Honestly, didnt like it when I first heard it, dissapointed that it was the first single, and the video stinks...not a bad song, just there are others lots more better...    Dear Rosemary - 4 out of 5 - Different souding than most Foo songs.      White Limo - 5 out of 5 - OMG!! Heavy, Dave screaming the lyrics, throwback to the first album.      Arlandria - 4 out of 5 - Great classic Foo song    These Days - 3 out of 5 - Catchy, sounds like could have been on Theres Nothing Left To Lose CD, nothing to memorable but still good.  Like the lyrics    Back and Forth - 4 out of 5 - Clasic Foo sound, destined ot be a hit single...Foo does pop metal better than NOBODY.  Very catchy chorus    A Matter Of Time - 5 out of 5 - Another classic Foo Fighters song.  Predict that this will be next single and it will be huge.  VERY CATCHY...more classic Foo sound    Miss The Misery - 5 out of 5 - my second favorite song on the CD...different than most Foo songs...LOVE the chorus, love the lyrics, love everything about this song. Also love that they throw in the name of the album in the chorus...definite classic    I Should have Known - 3 out of 5 - Here is where i get confused.  Some reviews are saying this is the best song on the album and best song Foo's ever released.  I just am not feeling it.  Slow little bluesy balad that gets heavier towrds the end.  Kind of eh for me...even with the presence of Nirvana bassist making a cameo    Walk - 5 out of 5 - Here it is, the BEST song on the album, and IMO the BEST FOO song EVER!!! Love love love this song.  Foo's seem to end each CD with a great song, and here is no different.  Hoping this will become a staple in Foo cincerts forever.  Lyrics are great, the middle bridge is simplay amazing, I have heard it at least 25 times now and i still get chills when I hear it.  Nobody does it like Foo Fighters do.  I read a review where they said Walk was just there, a throwaway.  My god could that be NOWHERE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.
0553593714|5.0|Caution: as mentioned previously in nearly every other comment, it's a very intense, graphic, and somewhat sad novel. But all that aside (if that's possible heh) it's incredibly well written...content as well as structure. Worth every moment I woke up two hours early and stayed up two hours late every night just to burn through it's riveting plotlines.
B004FOA84A|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable game with great graphics and a passable story line.  my only complaint is that it was far too short. I'd love to see a longer sequel or stand alone story.

B004XDYJRU|2.0|its ok but doesnt have clear channel stations.  the top two srations for rock in cincinnati are clear channel so its lacking abit in that dept.
0060557818|3.0|Interesting and well-wrought premise: \\"falling through society's cracks\\" as being more than simply symbolic. Liked ALL the characters.<br /><br />This is full-throttle alternate universe, which may be perfectly your cup of tea, but is a little too action-packed hectic for me. Still love Gaiman.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a fun game. Only thing is I want more! hopefully they could do some sequel thing. is this 25 words yet? How bout now?
B000FC10MU|4.0|Sure, loved the main character, but the side characters are FUN FUN FUN! Also loved the unique and captivating vignettes interspersed within the storyline.<br /><br />Best part? The way Gaiman wrapped up the ending, revealing Mr. Wednesday's true intent in his grand scheme and how Shadow fit in.<br /><br />Could be improved by harnessing the plot just a little. Prolong the wonder by finding that fine line and avoiding it's overuse. Not that I could do any better! Neil Gaiman is a genious and I'm definitely a fan!
B004FOA84A|1.0|This app will not run LG Optimus V. Amazon should actually confirm that an app will run on a particular device before indicating that it will.
0140120416|5.0|For the size and price of the book it packs a load of useful information. The format is easy to follow and very user friendly. it doesn't have enough exercises, but it is not geared toward mastery of the language, but rather gaining a working knowledge. It's a great value and exceeded my expectations by far.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Short but fun. Definitely a quick thrill for any MYST fan. Only hope they decide to make a sequel. Make it and make it soon!
B004FOA84A|5.0|great game.  dont know what everyone is whining about.  about an hours worth of fun for a buck (or free if you caught the amazon deal) is a great deal compared to your average shooter game on a console thats $60 for about eight hours of gameplay.  thanx again for the free game!  worked fine on my droid1.
0553288105|5.0|The book was brand new and though \\"The Gods Themselves\\" needs nothing extra to make it a great book, I still liked reading a new book.

B00006469V|5.0|Of course I must love Solti and his Wagner, but long before DVDs were available, I bought this on LP and immediately bought the CD version when it came out. Who can argue with a cast of Kollo, Ludwig, Fischer-Diescau, etc.?  Lacking spirituality? Maybe you are.<br /><br />The ultimate Parsifal for me had John Vickers and Ludwig conducted by Levine live at the Met. When I met Maestro Levine in Chicago, and I told him of his Parsifal, he asked \\"Which night?\\" I told him it was opening night, he reflected, and said \\"Yes, that was an excellent performance.\\" I now have his DVD, which is excellent, but cannot match the live performance. I return to Solti's regularly. Had bought Von Karajan's CD set and gave it away! How can they say Solti's is cold in comparison?<br />You either love Parsifal or you don't. And, don't forget Kiri is one of the Flower Maidens,along with Lucia Popp in this cast. A must for Wagner fan(atic). I show my age, but no one will ever match Fischer-Dieskau, Ludwig, or Kollo in these roles.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have three copies of this CD - one at home, one in the car and one at work. When the need hits - which is often - there is no substitute.

Great CPU Great Price. Easy to Install comes with AMDs stock Heat sink which works fine if you do not plan to over-clock your cpu. The heat sink came with a factory heat conducting paste which is easily removed to use after market thermal paste if planning on over-clocking.  Good buy if your looking to bring your cpu up to speed without out going overboard on spending for the newer x6 core CPUs.

Bringing together academics, practitioners and the judiciary, it also, quite appropriately, commemorated the Centenary of the Society of Legal Scholars.<br /><br />It was in 1909 that the first meeting of the Society took place in exactly the same room, the aim being then and now, to maintain and nurture the relationship between academic and practicing lawyers<br /><br />The book is a compilation of the actual papers delivered by the twelve expert contributors to the seminar.  The result is a wealth of erudition and insight which is particularly valuable to practitioners, academics and certainly students alike.  It must have been a privilege to attend this historic occasion, but if you weren't there - here it is in essence, in this book.  A couple of examples here will give you an idea of the flavour of its contents.<br /><br />There's the keynote address from the Hon Michael Kirby entitled `A Darwinian Reflection on Judicial Values and Appointments to Final National Courts'.  The argument here, in favour of variety and evolution when it comes to appointing judges to our highest courts, is also taken up by Dr Aileen Kavanagh.  Her chapter: `From Appellate Committee to UK Supreme Court:  Independence, Activism and Transparency' also questions whether increased transparency will necessarily translate into increased public confidence in the judiciary.  Hmm!<br /><br />Perhaps it's too early to comment on that and the debate of course continues.  On this and a range of other equally pertinent topics, the book delivers divergent and closely argued points of view.<br /><br />You could also regard the book as a handy research tool, with its extensive tables of cases and of legislation -- some of it from other jurisdictions -- and the invaluable index.<br /><br />Suffice to say that the book more than achieves its stated aim: `to reflect upon the jurisprudence of the House of Lords and to consider the prospects for judging in the new Supreme Court.' Yes, a choice collection of papers on this momentous transition!on that and the debate of course continues.

Legal issues arising from healthcare as a profession, the structure of the NHS and the evolving regulatory environments which impact on it are also dealt with as the controversies rage.<br /><br />The book is the result of team efforts by at least 20 expert contributors.  As the editors acknowledge, `the depth of expertise that this volume has demonstrated in the past has been retained, whilst the changes that [have been] introduced reflect the evolving nature of this dynamic discipline'.<br /><br />In over 1,200 pages with 22 chapters and two short appendices, usefully and punctiliously annotated and footnoted where appropriate, this heavy volume is logically organized into seven parts, covering areas such as:<br /><br />The Organization of Health Care ... Regulating Health Care Professions... Duties of Contract and Tort and Breach of Duty... Consent to Treatment...Test for Capacity... Mental Health law... Clinical Research... Medically Assisted reproduction... the Regulation of Medicinal Products... and Medical Devices Patenting and the Human Body -- and more besides.<br /><br />Of great interest is Part Seven of the book which deals with the many fraught and vexed legal issues surrounding the ending of life, as well as the finality of death itself and how we might review this area of law in the future.<br /><br />It's an authoritative, detailed and scholarly work of reference which should be considered an essential purchase for any practitioner involved in any aspect of the law pertaining to healthcare.<br /><br />As one would expect of a work of this stature and erudition, there are over a hundred pages of tables of cases, legislation, statutory instruments and treaties and conventions, as well as a table of European Law and a table of Legislation from other jurisdictions. A useful and lengthy index facilitates further research for a work which is aimed at such a wide readership.<br /><br />The law is stated as at May 2010, plus further relevant changes added at proof stage to assist in what is such a changing landscape at such a difficult time.be considered an essential purchase for any practitioner involved in any aspect of the law pertaining to healthcare.

1405748079|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo15Z0EJMAX0JM8]]YET CONTEMPORARY AND AUTHORITATIVE WORK ON MODERN MORTGAGE LAW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This - the 13th edition of Fisher and Lightwood's Law of Mortgage, is the inspired and erudite result of the combined efforts of eight learned contributors from Falcon Chambers, under co-coordinating editor, Wayne Clark.<br /><br />The first edition of Fisher and Lightwood's published 1856 was, we can only assume, a masterpiece of research and systemization. The original author, William Fisher, from all accounts had the gift of imposing order on chaos, compiling and organizing what was then an amorphous mass of information and he structuring it logically into what was acknowledged then and now as an authoritative and easy to use work of reference for all practitioners involved in any aspect of mortgages. And that is what we have here!<br /><br />Like many other classic legal works of similar vintage, Fisher and Lightwood's has been updated over the years, remaining perennially fresh and topical. This, the latest edition from Butterworth's Lexis Nexis, reveals a number of new developments. The chapter on Charging Orders has been expanded; the chapter on Consumer Credit has been completely revised following the Consumer Credit Act 2006 -- and the chapters on mortgagee's remedies have been largely restructured. The many new cases that have transpired since the last edition have all been included as the subject matter remains high on both the legal and political agendas.<br /><br />Though thoroughly contemporary, the work remains true to the ethos of the original by the extraordinary William Richard Fisher whose short biography by Edward Peters prefaces the main text. The reviewers of the original edition were almost unanimously enthusiastic; one - The Law Times -- observed that Fisher had `reduced the various elements from the chaos into which they have hitherto been plunged, to order and consistency. `All who are concerned in mortgage transactions...will nowhere find so much, so careful, and such recent information as Mr Fisher has collected.' Another review predicted that the work would come to be recognized as a standard authority. And so it has come to pass.<br /><br />If you're a practitioner involved in any aspect of mortgage law, here, in one volume (without loose-leaves), is the research and insight that will add authority and value to your advocacy. By the way, if you're additionally involved in any issues concerning the conversation of land and property - forests, to take an example, you'd be interested to know that Fisher was a key figure in preserving 6,000 acres of Epping Forest for the nation.<br /><br />Fisher was involved in a series of suits and arbitrations in the 1860s and 1870s carried out by a united front of villagers, commoners, preservationists and the City of London fighting off certain landowners who `wished to enclose and develop'.<br /><br />Too bad he's not around today, is what we say!<br /><br />As you would expect, the usual research and reference tools are in place in this carefully annotated volume of at least 1,200 pages in 56 chapters, including extensive tables of statutes, cases and statutory instruments. The Table of Contents is minutely detailed for ease of use and there is an excellent index. The law is stated as at 1 July 2010, and, yes, it remains a classic for its authority and contemporaneity.concerned in mortgage transactions...will nowhere find so much, so careful, and such recent information as Mr Fisher has collected.'

Having been updated a hundred and nineteen times since James Paterson started it all, it stays perennially fresh, contemporary, up to date and indisputably authoritative.<br /><br />Paterson's is not without its lighter moments either (thankfully), revealing, inevitably, the more than occasional insight into human failings and foibles which is always to be expected with licensing.<br /><br />For example, there's the case of a Mr. Boyle -- whom we will call the hard-up Haverhill pub crawler - who was banned by the Haverhill Pub Watch from entering any of its member pubs - a ban that was extended for a further two years.<br /><br />After mightily fighting the decision to ban him -- which involved a judgment 59 paragraphs long -- the ban was upheld, causing Boyle not inconsiderable grief.<br /><br /> `The pubs in Haverhill must be very good that Mr Boyle was prepared to spend so much money trying to get his ban lifted,' declared the judge. `Unhappily he will have to continue his drinking elsewhere, but with a lot less to spend on it.'<br /><br />Thus, it covers the broad spectrum of human life and activity which is gradually revealed in this scholarly and thorough work of reference for lawyers and licensing specialists.<br /><br />Incorporated in its two-volume bulk is all case law and judgments pertaining to licensing in England and Wales, with commentary... and there is nothing to beat it!<br /><br />Volume I is logically structured in five parts, each part covering, with commentary, the relevant statutes, statutory instruments and forms where applicable, to include sex establishments in Part 1A preceded by:<br />alcohol, refreshment and entertainment licensing... door supervisors - security industry authority...street trading...appeals, civil procedure and crime (miscellaneous)... and additional material.<br /><br />Similarly divided into three parts, Volume 2 covers betting, gaming and lotteries including the Gambling Act 2005.<br /><br />As one would expect of a work of this stature and erudition, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments and a useful and lengthy index to facilitate research.  The law is stated as at 1st September 2010, `save where it has proved possible to introduce more recent developments,' say the authors, as well they might because the new government has plans for localism which could well change the content substantially from next year as the law changes policy so Paterson's will keep you as up to date in preference to any other work.instruments and forms where applicable, to include sex establishments in Part 1A preceded by:  alcohol, refreshment and entertainment licensing... door supervisors - security industry authority...street trading...appeals, civil procedure and crime (miscellaneous)... and additional material.

B004FOA84A|2.0|Glad I got it free. It gives no instructions so you are left guessing the whole game on how to play or what to do next. Plus extremely short game from beginning to end.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Literally one of the best apps on android. It works as well as the streaming capabilities of whatever station you choose. Definitely stoked to get Pro for free.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Samsung Fascinate-force closes when you try to open it extremely frequently (took usually 3-5 tries to actually get it to open). Game is very short. Fun, but I was able to complete it in under 45 minutes, including the amount of time I spent clicking, waiting for launch, immediate force close, repeat repeat repeat-total playtime was proably 30-35 minutes. Would have been very nice to have more puzzles or levels.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Not quite sure what is going on, but I get a force close every two minutes on my Htc Aria.  Free version worked fine no issues, I guess I'm going back.
B004289ZW0|4.0|Worked right out of the box. Simple instructions on how to \\"tie\\" it to an iDevice.  I am NOT a fan of the on/off mechanism. Turns on very easy. PITA to turn off. I'd have paid an extra few bucks to have a normal switch.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Not bad for a dollar if you are a fan of the genre and want something friendly. Nice graphics and music. OK intro to the genre,  but it's not Maniac Mansion. Touch makes it easy. Takes an hour or so. Silly end. And like many of this genre it has Zero replay value. Might crash if you leave the game, (on my froyo,  Vibrant)    but it's not a problem as it auto saves so you don't lose progress.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great little game...couple of challenging puzzles thrown in.  The only thing that could improve is the length.  20-30 minutes and you are done and no replay value.
B004FOA84A|3.0|game has incredible grafix, a spooky soundtrack, and a half add decent storyline.  unfortunately it seems to only have one level.  very short game wish it would have been at least long enough to take up a couple of hours of dead time at work.
076115678X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I was so excited to see the photos of before and after that I just HAD to know how they could improve the health and looks of their hair so much! I plan on going full-force with the no-poo shampoo philosophy next week when I have all the products I need to maintain it, which isn't much at all, it's less products than shampooing!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is great. It's much faster and sleeker than the ThinkFree Office that came installed on my Android Vortex. Got it free when Amazon offered it. Would've paid for it anyway after seeing how well it works.
0345477618|5.0|The Making of Star Wars by J.W. Rinzler<br />Ballantine Books, 2007<br />353 pages<br />Non-fiction; Hollywood<br />5/5 stars<br /><br />Source: Library<br /><br />This is a massive coffee-table book but it is covering a big topic: the genesis and making of Star Wars (A New Hope).  There are so many pictures, excerpts from early scripts, quotes from many of the principal figures, both on and off screen talent.  The best part is that those quotes are culled from interviews from about 1975-79, right as the instances happened and not as involved in the success and hype that followed.  Nobody anticipated the runaway success Star Wars was!<br /><br />While I knew about some of the challenges faced during production, I didn't know the half.  In general, the technology of the time was not able to cope with the demands of George Lucas for this film, which resulted in a lot of frustration and compromise.  I think that helps to explain Episodes I-III, where the technology was so much more advanced.  Some of the parts were confusing to me as there are many people and technologies mentioned that were previously unfamiliar to me.  However a careful reading helps to sort that out.<br /><br />My favorite sections were about the actors and John Williams' score, as they were the parts I sort of knew already.  It definitely made me want to go rewatch Star Wars and also listen to the soundtrack because it really is such great music.<br /><br />Looking forward to The Making of The Empire Strikes Back so I can find out how they created Yoda and came up with that spoiler-you know the one ;) because as of the first film, that wasn't part of the plan.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|The future is now. It never got anything on the radio wrong. Even remixes. An app that can make my doctorate in DJ-ing and my masters in music recognition seem like a waste of time? It's the apocalypse alright.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love Castle!  All the characters are so interesting and the chemistry between Detective Beckett and Castle is so fun to watch!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I don't understand why this is getting so many bad reviews. Yes, it is very short but its super fun. Some of the men here should get 1 star for how short they are. ( and I don't mean hight. )
B004FOA84A|4.0|OK this is a great game, a little short but very fun for an hour. everyone who is saying it force closes is correct, it does. but if you reboot it's all good.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Dear God, when your break-up songs sound just as peppy and happy as your up-tempo tracks, then that's the mark of something different.  Bought this disc Christmas 2010, and the truth be told, it's a very happy CD!  Every track had me bopping my head and trying to learn the words.  Bruno is a whiz at bringing the happy back to music, and even though I am not a true pop fan, this was a welcome suprise to my ears.  Those grammy nominations were worth it, cause this dude has got the gift...and he clearly knows how to use it!
B004FOA84A|3.0|good but when will part 2 be out to make this great. I finished but grandpa left me in suspence. I will then rate it a 5 star.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|This sophomoric effort is just as tight as her debut album, the production value being upped in quality and all.  Jennifer is just in her element here and her voice...OOOOOOHHHHH MMMMMANNNN.....is just as supreme as ever.  If I may be so bold, I like this effort more than the last one, and I loved that disc!  Jennifer, no matter what happens from here on out, please give us the real music quality that the real music lovers want, and we will NEVER abandon you.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|The original Star Trek series was my favorite television show growing up, and I was generally pleased with the second season I recently purchased. My only disappointment was with how the different episodes are formatted in this series. Rather than allowing the viewer to watch all of the episodes on a given disk in continuous order, you have to select and view each episode individually. When an episode is over, you are brought to a main menu that has to be navigated each time, which is annoying. But the purchase was still well worth it.
B004FOA84A|4.0|would have gave it 5 stars if it were longer. this game actually makes you use your brain in a few spots! cant wait for a new version.
0439023491|5.0|I am 24 and a little older than the demographic this book is for but I have got say this series is one of my all time Favorites now! I wish there were more books to it, I went though all 3 in 4 days I just could not but them down. I am impatiently awaiting the movies to premier!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Free version of this program is great. Getting the pro version free is even better.  Recording streaming should be mighty useful from time to time.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed this game.  My kids had fun helping me find the clues.  I wish there had been a couple more chapters to the story.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Great app, lots of stations and good podcast selection, but I have had 5 forced closes today so far... hopefully this will be fixed. I'm using an HTC EVO.
0590129279|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time! Don't be fooled by the simple appearance of this book; there is some really deep material between the covers. I've pondered whether to call this book a fable or a parable. Ultimately, I've decided it's some form of both. As the Little Prince travels through the universe he meets many different people (and animals) that teach him great lessons about life.<br /><br />The story begins with the Little Prince leaving his small planet because he is not happy. As he travels the universe he stops on other planets and talks to the inhabitants. Most of the people that he meets on these planets are adults and represent the worst of human behavior and foolishness. My favorites are the Vain Man who \\"cannot hear anything but praise\\" and the drunkard that drinks because he feels guilty about drinking. While these characters are not meant to be likeable, they represent many of the problems that we face in society (i.e. the need for applause and constant praise and the drunkard's guilt cycle).<br /><br />Eventually the Little Prince makes his way to earth, which is where he meets the narrator of the story--a pilot who has become stranded in the middle of the Sahara Desert because his plane crashed. Before meeting the pilot, the Little Prince meets a snake and a fox. The Prince's time with the fox turns out to be a life changing moment. Through his interactions with the fox he learns a great secret: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" With this knowledge the Prince realizes that his life is special and he decides to make the hard journey back to his small planet and the precious flower that lives there.<br /><br />I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this book. As a small child I remember watching the cartoon adaptation of Nickelodeon. Of course, I didn't realize there was a book at that time. In high school we had to read this book in our French class. That was the first time I read it, and I instantly fell in love. As an adult it has an even deeper hold on me. The author of the book wrote this story after his town in France had been overrun by the Nazis during World War 2. Knowing that information gives this book an even deeper illumination of the human spirit--both good and bad. The content is both deep and moving, while funny and simple at the same time. You can find humor in the generalizations about adults and children, and I'm sure we can all see a little of ourselves in some of the characters. As a whole, the story is beautifully written and immensely thought provoking. You cannot read this book and not ponder life's greatest questions. It's impossible.<br /><br />If you have not read this charming children's book, you are missing one of the greatest stories ever written! It's a quick and easy read, but it will linger in your thoughts well after you have finished reading.I instantly fell in love. As an adult it has an even deeper hold on me.

B004FOA84A|1.0|It won't even open, no matter how many times I uninstall/install.I hope that this is fixed later. I am really wanting to play it.  I'm trying to run it on a Optimus V
B004D7GU3C|5.0|I bought this with great expectations, and was greatly surprised! If I could rate it with 100 stars I would! Awesome to infinity! I really hope he gets the chance to release a lot of the ballads in english Tracks 5 & 6 as well for those who don't understand spanish; as well as Track # 8. Yes, This is our time!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|first time reviewing an Amazon app - after downloading any app(in google) you can just give an app 5 stars.....but here i have to write 25 words first.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This movie was brand new in original packaging even though it is still in the Walt Disney vault.  My 3 year old granddaughter was so excited to watch it.  She held the stuffed Lady dog that I also bought her while she watched.  Wonderful experience for little sweet girl!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|These things sound fantastic. Since I picked them up for the kids I cant hear a thing and the house is quiet again.    They sound pretty darn good when you are wearing them too.    Well worth the money !!!
B004FOA84A|4.0|It isnt the longest game in the world, but i really enjoyed it for the hour or so it kept me occupied. Made for a great download of the day.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I am a 72 year old great grand ma and this show keeps my heart beating. All I can say is it is a good thing I live in the country, so the neighbors won't call the cops when I am screaming at the TV. This show packs more into each ep, than most series do all year. The season one DVD has loads of bonus material that is worth the price of the disks. Ian Somerhalder is excellent as the bad boy Damon and I have cried, make that sobbed, buckets with and for him. He has really taken this character to the highest level of acting and looks so hot and sexy doing it. lol I had already fallen in love with Ian after watching the movie Changing Hearts, but have to say Damon is my favorite Vampire.    I have all the eps on my DVR, but the disks are a must have and looking forward to season 2.
B000093BDX|4.0|This CD will make you wish that every day was a beach day.  Very fun for the summertime, and all year round when you only wish it was summertime!
B004ISVH7U|5.0|Oh No it's been 40 years! This was my first album that I had brought as a kid and still one of my favorites! It's a Classic!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is perfect.  I can't understand how anyone could justify giving this less than 5 stars.  Every nearby (&lt;200 miles) radio station I can even think of is available, plus weather radio, plus other types of broadcasts.  Been using the free version for a while, so the pro version is just a bonus.  $0.99 is still a bargain if you missed out on the free promo.  It's worth it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|People are dumb to rate this badly because its short.  Its awesome.  You dont need a long game to kill your battery.  Play your console games for extensive hours in gameplay.  If you dont like it then try making your own.
0439023521|5.0|Well there has certainly been a lot of hype over The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and I'm going to be joining in. I really enjoyed the book although I have to say that the beginning few chapters really didn't grab me and I was beginning to wonder why everyone was so crazy about the book. Then the Hunger Games began and I was hooked and I just couldn't even put it down!<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a dystopian novel - it takes place in the future. These kinds of books always give me pause as you never know what can become of our world. The world now is run by the Capitol and in it are 12 districts which each run their own industry such as coal mining, agriculture, etc. There still seems to be the usual hierarchy in power even in this new world with the richer people who can afford to eat, etc. and those who can't who rely on hunting for their food instead.<br /><br />This is the world Katniss lives in. She is part of District 12 and her father, before he got killed, was a coal miner. While he was alive the family of Katniss, her mother and her little sister Prim had enough to live on but afterwards, well that was a disaster. Katniss ended up being the caretaker essentially of the family as her mother fell into a deep depression. This is how Katniss ends up being such a good hunter; she really had no choice. She has a hunting partner too, Gale, a boy who is in much the same boat as she is.<br /><br />Every year the Capitol puts on The Hunger Games which is a hunt to the death for the participants. There can be only one winner. The Hunger Games came about as a way of keeping the districts in line. This event is huge. There are celebrations and it's televised - even the poor communities who are lucky to have power for a few hours a day always manage to have power during this event. The Capitol will take, by draw, one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 to participate in the games. Over the years members of families can trade in extra entries for the games for food for their family so needless to say both Katniss and Gale have quite a few in there trying to provide for their families.<br /><br />So the day arrives and everyone is gathered to learn who will be going to the games. The names are drawn for District 12 and Prim, Katniss's sister is chosen. Before Prim can even reach the stage 16 year old Katniss steps up and takes her place. The boy from District 12 is Peeta, he is the baker's son. He is also a boy that Katniss feels she owes something as once, long ago when her family was starving, as a little boy Peeta risked a beating to get a few loaves of bread to Katniss.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta go through all the lengthy celebrations and other matters to get to the games but eventually the day does arrive. The 24 participants are let out into an area that is wooded and left to fend on their own and kill each other. This is where the story takes off for me and the pages flew. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next and how Katniss would make it or if she even would. The author manages to create a very believable world in this novel.<br /><br />I really liked the character of Katniss and of Peeta as well. They are both good kids put in a bad situation. Neither is a killer but when it's either do or die, I think most of us would go to any length to protect ourselves. Katniss is a tough girl and yet very caring as well. She will go to any lengths to protect her family and she's just plain likable being a funny and smart girl. I am very curious to see how the relationships will go in the second book - will it be Katniss and Peeta or Katniss and Gale. I have no preference yet as I think both of them are stand up guys. Maybe the second book will lead me to want to choose between them.<br /><br />I've already started Catching Fire, the second book in the series but I haven't gotten far enough to be completely taken with it yet to the point where I will be unable to put it down until I finish it. I almost want to wait a while to read it so I don't have as long to wait for Mockingjay but I know that won't happen so I won't even try. I do recommend this book for those who haven't actually read it t yet, especially to those who like these types of novels that deal with what the future could possibly be. I'm certainly looking forward to more!but I know that won't happen so I won't even try. I do recommend this book for those who haven't actually read it t yet, especially to those who like these types of novels that deal with what the future could possibly be. I'm certainly looking forward to more!
0739368435|5.0|I bought this book on CD so I could listen while driving to work. It was easy to follow the letters because each character was played by a different actor with wonderful British accents. I learned a lot because I did not know that the Nazis occupied Guernsey during WWII.  I loved the story and found myself looking up information about Guernsey on line. What wonderful characters!  I found it a little confusing in the begining and am happy that have the CD because I am listening to it again and finding it is much more enjoyable the second time.
B004AYCWZI|4.0|The Hundred-Foot Journey by Richard C. Morais is as much a journey through food as it is through Hassan Haji's life. It's a beautifully written novel with such vivid descriptions of food and place that at times I felt I was right there in the story.<br /><br />Hassan Haji is born into a very ambitious family of men and from a child has grown up with food as a central part of his life. His grandfather started a restaurant in India when Hassan was a boy and that's where he gets his first taste at cooking. However, too soon tragedy strikes and Hassan loses his mother prompting the family to leave India stopping first in England and then moving on to France and a village called Lumiere.<br /><br />In Lumiere, Hassan's father decides to build a restaurant regardless of the fact that there is one across the street run by Madame Mallory who is not at all fond of a different culture invading her neighborhood. Despite Madame Mallory trying to sabotage Hassan's family at every turn the restaurant finally opens and on the first night is fully booked. Included in the clientele is none other than Madame Mallory who has come to see what this new restaurant is all about. However she ends up being completely shocked after tasted Hassan's food and realizing that he is one of those individuals with a natural talent for cooking and creating beautiful dishes.<br /><br />Well this makes Madame Mallory even more determined to get rid of the Haji's and at one point an argument ensues and Hassan ends up being seriously burned. This prompts Madame Mallory to take a much closer look at herself and she asks the Haji's to stay in the neighborhood and not move back to England. Hassan's father is having none of it; he's moving his family out of there. Then Madame Mallory throws another hook into things asking for Hassan to come live and train under her to become French chef. Needless to say this throws Hassan's father into a tizzy but eventually he agrees.<br /><br />Hassan learns his craft well and finally years later ends up with his own restaurant and becomes extremely successful. This novel really gives us a look into different cultures and how they do things and how these differences relate to food as well. It also shows us how prejudice can do more harm than good and once people open their hearts and minds to these differences in people they find a whole new world open to them.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. I liked many of the characters but found Hassan's father to be quite funny. He's described as a big man and his temper gets the best of him most of the time and some of the things he came out with gave me a giggle. However he was a very determined man out to do the best for his family and that he did. Hassan is much the same, not in an outwardly explosive personality, but more in his determination to succeed as well. He had a gift to share with the world in the beauty and taste of his food and that's what he ultimately succeeded at doing.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about the novel it would be that more of the novel would have been like the beginning. I felt the beginning started out with really giving us a feel for Hassan's family and his life but once they moved to France most of the story was focused solely on the restaurant side of things and I really still would have liked to know more about the personal side of both Hassan and his family. This is a minor complaint though and most definitely doesn't take away from the beauty of the novel at all. I absolutely loved the descriptions of the markets, kitchens, and most of all the food.up with his own restaurant and becomes extremely successful.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app! Please allow move to sd card.  Record shows and listen later. Useful. Interface is great too, very smooth and responsive. Great for getting.  Gdddfgc
B003ES61EE|3.0|While there are certainly better products available on the market, many of them are significantly more expensive.  For your average weekend photographer, this brush whill be a fine purchase.  Those who want to do professional or professional style photography may want one of the higher-end options, but I see no reason why your average user won't find this an attractive choice.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great game. difficult enough and really fun to play. needs to be longer though. reminds me of myst. update with more content and i will buy.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Never Executes!  Difficult to evaulate since App does not run.  I hope an update will correct.  App does look promising.  Most likely,  it is something simple to correct.  Droid X.
B004FOA84A|1.0|force close every time on evo and on my wife phone as well, concept looks good but I guess I will never know due to this piece of free crap.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Pros:  easy interface, acts like a dvr (i can rewind!), can record to play later on, search function found what I wanted. Cons: none that I can find
B004KSQN7C|2.0|Whhaaa..aaaa..aaaaa.tttt tooooo.oooo saaayyayyaay about Femme Fatale? Well, I wanted to like it, i really did. I'm one of the few out there who thought that \\"Blackout\\" was an extremely enjoyable album with just a few clunkers. This, on the other hand, is something else entirely. There are a few good songs here, but the fact is, they all sound exactly the same. Inane cooing from the 21st century Casio sex-o-matic is not really something that people should have to pay good money to hear. Insipid, pointless lyrics (just listen to \\"Criminal\\" and remember that this is a 29 year old mother)over \\"music\\" obviously beamed in from outer space (I actually stopped in my tracks when I heard a piano in \\"Big Fat Bass\\") just goes to show how little it takes to entertain people today. It's really hard to tell whether Britney actually entered a studio to record these songs or just sent her answering machine tapes in so that editors could chop them up and lay them over some beats. I do believe there was a time when Britney was actually a human being who could sing  (and maybe cared) rather than the Fembot that she played in the \\"Austin Powers\\" movie who has a computerised voice box where her actual larynx used to be. Maybe she's Stephen Hawking. In any event, the \\"songs\\" are certainly catchy enough and,if you like one, you'll like them all. But, remember v.d. is also catchy-and it's also not something else you'd be proud to tell people you have.
B004HUE57S|5.0|This mouse is incredible!  I was experiencing a lot of pain in my thumb, and after using this mouse for 2 weeks, I don't notice the pain at all.  I never realized how much I used my thumb with a basic mouse.  This one really protects my thumb from excessive exertion.  I purchased one for my home office as well as for work.
B004FOA84A|1.0|The app Force Closes on my rooted HTC EVO.   Good thing it was free.  I Would have been disappointed if I had paid for it.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Good but not great. I had high hopes for this application after reading the reviews, and there is a decent selection of local stations. That being said I can only give it 4 stars since all 3 of my favorite stations are missing. It streams fast and has good sound quality, so I can't complain too much.<br /><br />Update 9/3/11: After the last update I decided to play with this again. They seem to be adding stations constantly. Now all but one of the stations I like are in here. It will be a handy app when I take trips so I can still listen to my favorite stations.<br /><br />Update 10/14/11: So it seems I lied. My favorite stations are not there, just listed. Seems Clear Channel doesn't want to share and won't allow their stations on this app. Guess you have to have IheartRadio for those.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app! The DVR-like functionality is great (you can pause, rewind, and fast forward the current station). Also lets you set reminders and a sleep timer, and view the program listings.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game is very well done. The graphics are great, the music is enthralling and the puzzles are clever and very logical. My only gripe is that for a paid game, it is way too short. I finished it in about 30 minutes. Glad I got it on free day.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I have a G2 and this game runs great on it.  I hope they come out with more of this type of game! i dare you to get to the end without getting help on the internet?
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|I was ever expecting anything profound out of this novel, but it failed to live up to anything spectacularly entertaining, either.  I may have been biased by knowing the particulars of the plot beforehand (I, like so many other reviewers, am a fan of the television series), but the story more dragged me along than pushed me forward.  It was a quick read; I spent maybe four hours on it, and I don't exactly consider that time wasted, but I think that it lacks much of the charm that Michael C. Hall brought to this character.  The television series makes a point of Dexter's sociopathic tendencies without belaboring the point. In the novel, on the other hand, seemed like every other sentence was a cry of \\"look at how ironic and interesting I am being!\\"  Novel Dexter reads as much more of a narcissist, and incidentally, much less intriguing than the understated Hall performance.  I was also hoping that, even knowing the resolution before the conclusion, the book would sew more of a mystery that I could solve along with it.  To someone who had never seen the series, I feel like the reader would feel cheated at the revelation of the murderer, like, \\"And I was supposed to solve this... how?\\"  There was some awkward writing; anytime a writer uses the term \\"a single hummingbird's fart\\" as a euphemism, my respect is diminished incredibly.  Many of the side characters lacked any development, which I found disappointing, although pragmatic in the view of a first-person narrative.  The epilogue literally made me roll my eyes with it's obvious facade.      What worked best were Dexter's murder scenes, and despite the pretentiousness of it, I found the alliteration and double-letter themes to be rather amusing.    I feel like Lindsay was an inexperienced writer with a wonderful concept.  I will likely read more of the series, and maybe that will change.  I would recommend this as a beach book, but overall, there are better crime novels, and more interesting character studies to be selected.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game, but I'm rating it 4 stars only because it was too short (finished it in less than an hour). Very entertaining, so I'm hoping for a sequel. Worked really well on my Droid 2, and it didn't force close on me at all. Keep up the good work developers! And please hurry on part 2!!! Thanks :)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have used this app for quite a while and upgraded to Pro version.  Not sure what all the complaints are about.  It has worked great.  Once in a while you lose a signal but that's to be expected as your location changes or whatever tower you're pulling from has issues.  It's free people.  I don't see the point in giving it one star because you can't get 1 channel out of the thousands plus that are available from all over the world.  As to permissions, I have never had a problem and I suspect access is necessary if you want to have the \\"local\\" station list for your area.  Again, it is free, I get literally any genre I want, never had a problem.  It is sad that someone would give this app a poor rating because they can't receive one particular station.  You may not be aware but some stations are payware through services like XM/Sirius, Live!365, etc.  That may be why you cannot receive them.
B004FOA84A|1.0|On my Motorola Droid the program never opened but all ways forced close.  I tried rebooting and reinstalling in several combinations, but no luck.  it looks like fun, I hope an update comes soon.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I am very pleased to recommend this eclectic mix of music.  Each track is unique and shows Robert Plant's versatility and style.  A quality recording and a very fine performance.
0316056863|5.0|I have never seen 30 Rock, don't ever watch SNL, and only know who Tina Fey is from her Sarah Palin impersonation. Therefore, I was not at all prepared to fall so in love with her book. What a joy and delight this has been. It's laugh out loud (another thing I never do) funny and incredibly refreshing to read. Tina Fey has a new fan and she deserves millions more.
0345505387|2.0|I am as addicted to Diana Gabaldon's books as anyone can be, but I was highly disappointed in this book.  I doubt that the illustrator ever read OUTLANDER because none of his depictions even resemble the characters.  And the \\"extra\\" plot is thin.  I donated my copy to the library because I didn't want it taking up space on my bookshelf.
0670022411|2.0|I gave up on this book because I realized after reading about 150 pages that the plot hadn't developed much further than what you can read from the book jacket.  I had learned that our heroine wears lots of black, likes a good steaming hot mug of tea, and exercises constantly but not much else that was of value.  I also wasn't entirely sure I cared much for our hero, Matthew.  OK, he's a sexy, dangerous vampire, but where are his heroic qualities?  He just seemed like a really good looking guy who's used to getting what he wants.  It also seemed entirely out of character that he should be devoted to yoga.  The author describes him as being old fashioned and hyper-masculine, yet there he is wearing his loose fitting yoga clothes, schlepping his mat to class.<br /><br />I had hoped_A Discovery of Witches_ would contain a cohesive, well-planned plot with some likable characters but was let down.  It draws heavily on Twilight and even somewhat from Harry Potter.  If you would like to give this book a shot, I would recommend checking it out from the library.  It just isn't worth the purchase price.
B0000041CZ|4.0|On first listen, this recording is a bit shocking. The performance is utterly clinical. The tempos are so regular and fastidious, the fingering so cool and mechanical, it almost sounds like a computer-generated MIDI rendering.    The recording too is utterly dry. The microphones are right on top of the instrument. You can clearly hear the notes spread left to right across the stereo image, as if you were sitting at the keyboard yourself.    Is the result unlistenable? Far from it! Gulda's distinctive approach emphasizes the MECHANICS of the music. It's an interesting and valuable persepctive on a work that is more than deep enough to support many interpretations.    Tureck is still my desert island choice for the WTC, but I'm glad this is in my library, too.    Recommended if you already have at least two other WTCs in your collection and are looking for something fresh.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Until it can be moved to sd this 17mb behemoth will remain uninstalled.  The brief time I did play it it seemed pretty good. I'm waiting for release 2.0
B000002AGN|5.0|This is a recording that I wanted to replace since I first gave up the LP.  After all of these years, Brubeck still fills the room with these timeless classics.  Blue Rondo A La Turk and Take 5, need I say more?
B004FQKY5Q|4.0|Charm School is another solid album from a great band that has been out of the picture for far too long. Per Gessle has made some outstanding solo albums since last we heard from Roxette, but it's great to hear him back with Marie Fredriksson after her illness made it seem for a while that she'd never return to making music. That sickness, by the way, doesn't seem to have hurt her voice one bit: she sounds fantastic. Per and Marie are very comfortable together, and the pairing frees Per to write the kind of lovely ballad that he doesn't otherwise do, like \\"No One Makes It on Her Own\\" or \\"In My Own Way.\\" Working with Marie and having the history of Roxette as a foundation also makes Per's pop songs seem that much bigger and arena-friendly, like the great single \\"She's Got Nothing On (But the Radio).\\"<br /><br />One wouldn't expect this album to be a monster hit like in Roxette's heyday, so they hedge their bets a bit to make the album more enticing for newer and older fans alike, including in the deluxe edition a live album recorded in 2010, which is all but a greatest hits collection in its own right. The performances are excellent, if unsurprising in any way. For a few extra bucks, it's a nice bonus.<br /><br />The only real drawback to this album for me is the apparent rip-off of the riff from Fleetwood Mac's \\"Seven Wonders\\" on the album-closing \\"Sitting on Top of the World.\\" It's unclear to me whether this is a tribute to that song (the way Beatle-esque guitar parts are used on the wonderful \\"After All\\"), a coincidence, or just a stolen riff. Per Gessle is such a master of pop hooks that I wish I knew for sure what the intention of that part is. Either way, I find it a bit distracting from an otherwise lovely and moving song.<br /><br />Overall, this sounds just like a Roxette album should, filled with great singing, a warm atmosphere, memorable hooks and melodies, and all-round excellent songs. There's nothing quite on the level of \\"Joyride\\" or \\"Listen to Your Heart,\\" but for where Roxette are today, it's still a great addition to any fan's collection.oxette are today, it's still a great addition to any fan's collection.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I saw the original twice, once at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and once in San Francisco.  I ran into this version by accident and only caught the end.  Based solely on that snippet, I purchased the Blu-ray.  Fantastic!  I normally don't enjoy concert versions of musicals; this is clearly the exception.  I'm enjoying it more that the two previous performances I've seen.
B0034G4ORM|1.0|This film could not have been any worse if it had had John Wayne in it. The editing was horrible on every level, only beaten out by the non-existing directing and acting. The dialogue came from numerous grade B war movies. If you like good sci-fi stay far away from this loser.
0140143505|5.0|The book came quickly and in better shape than I thought it would.  The description said it had slight yellowing on the outside edges of the pages. While the book was obviously not brand new, it was in terrific shape with no noticeable discoloration.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Has the best download manager ever.i can download full length movies and tv shows without breaking a sweat.pinch to zoom if buttery smooth and taxed browsing Is perfect.also like the double tap to confirm feature. Flash works great and loads much faster than previous versions.
6305252521|5.0|I owned this movie for years on VHS and decided to go DVD.    Jim Carey doesn't come on too strong with his usual wild, weird faces and screaming. His acting is more subdued in this movie which I prefer.  It has comedy-sorrow-action (in the boat scene)-drama.  I wish he'd make more movies like this one because he does have a great depth to his acting that we don't get to see very much. :)    Truman was \\"adopted\\" by a Television Syndicate and his life is broadcast via reality television 24/7 without his knowledge.  Everything is \\"arranged\\" in this faux life...family, friends, job, marriage, etc.  But he falls in love with someone who hasn't been 'picked' by the boss. This starts his brain in motion and he begins to notice \\"things\\".  Which leads to the final outcome.  Won't spoil the ending...you'll have to watch it to find out.  :)    Great movie with a twist...a must see.  :) : :)
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game is great!   The graphics are excellent.   The game play,  however is too short and easy.   Maybe change the storyline into a longer story or multiple short stories.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|There have been some decent apps like this, but this is the best that I have tried. Really impressed with the easy and full-featured interface. Ace quality. Nexus S, Gingerbread v2.3.3 CyanogenMOD 7.0.0 Stable
B004FOA84A|2.0|I love this game and it works well. HTC EVO I only gave it 2 stars because it is 16 megs with no option to move to SD card.
1439181780|1.0|excuse me ms. byrne, how shall we address the little children sold into sexual slavery? were the babies thinking bad thoughts? also if i may.. how about the loss of daddies, mommies, husbands, wifes, sons and daughters who lost their lives in war? were the countries of Haiti and Japan not thanking the universe with enough gratitude?
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really enjoyed the game! It was fun and there should be others like it! Reminds me of Myst back in the day. Wish it was a little longer thats all. Make more!
1416562605|2.0|A car driver slits his boss's throat and steals his money to start a new life as an \\"entrepreneur\\" in Bangalore. The author presents this brave accomplishment as an attempt by the underdog to free himself from the \\"rooster coop\\" (i.e. the constraints Indian society). This philosophical exposition has something in common with Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, in which the main protagonist, Raskolnikov, kills an old lady to break his psychological shackles and start out on the road to greatness. But unlike Raskolnikov who in the end cannot come to terms with the immorality of what he had done (most of the book is in fact about his anguish and remorse), Adiga's character, Balram Halwai, seeks the reader's sympathy and understanding (indeed, who could bear massaging his master's stinking feet, etc, etc.).<br /><br />We are led to believe that Balram, once out of the rooster coop, is somehow different from the rich and the corrupt of India; he recounts his ambition to build a school, he assumes responsibility for a car accident, and what not - but in the end, what exactly is the difference between Balram and Mr. Ashok, whom he had murdered? There is just no moral to this story, no real message, except for the unclear threat of a \\"revolution\\" complete with the lynching of corrupt government officials by the beggars under the bridge for the sake of the bright future. Balram does not believe in the revolution, and finds a shortcut to good life by killing another person, and, indirectly, contributing to the death of his entire family. What a great achievement. Seems a bit shallow, if superficially entertaining. The book just does not make the sort of profound impression one occasionally gets from reading a true masterpiece. I'd stick with Dostoevsky.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Rio version of Angry Birds is excellent!  It's very well done,  works well on Droid 2 Global,  the game play is great!   Keep up the great work!
0375826726|5.0|Great book.... all three of them.  Highly recommend.  Can't wait for book 4.  Went into withdrawals for days after I finished the book.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|After finishing two volumes and approximately 1800 pages of fantasy fiction, I should care quite a bit about the story, but. I do not.<br />Rothfuss creates an appealing protagonist and his interesting episodes, but I am not compelled to like the book because it does not have an overarching story, let alone a clearly defined antagonist.  What is the point of the main character?  Is he after the mythical foes that killed his parents?  I am not compelled by the reading that he really is.<br /><br />Simply  put, Rothfuss had a great idea for a memorable character and he had many ideas of placing that character in memorable situations.  A greater story that would compell me as a reader to purchase, someday, his third volume is simply not there.  No depth of story.  I don't care about any of the characters to continue reading.  1800 pages is a lot of pages to read and not be compelled.<br /><br />Perhaps the author would have served his readers better by making into a separate book each of the many adventures the protagonist is experiencing, only go a bit deeper and with a point to each book.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't.  I give it two stars only because intuitively I sense that the syntax and sentence craft seems to be a little better than the first volume, even though the overarching story is not compelling.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is hands down the best streamer for local stations across the country. it has 90percent of the stations I search for. thanks!! nothing really tops it besides pandora.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I love this production of a classic broadway show.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|works well on my nexus s but some of my favorite stations are missing like Kiss FM from L.A. though I'm streaming FFH from Germany!
B00407PNY2|5.0|If you want to see the very first car chase scene of value (without a lot of tricks), this is the movie to get.
B00021HBGS|2.0|I'm guessing the idea is when the car and street stickers are wet they should stick to the sides of the tub, allowing the children to mix and match which cars go on which road. Fun idea, especially for my 2 yr old son who LOVES cars.  I have 2 problems with this toy:<br /><br />1) The \\"street\\" stickers will stick to the sides of the tub when you have nothing on them, but put a couple cars on and they slide right into the tub, they're too heavy not to.  Also, who designed the shape of the street?  How is it that most of the street pieces are curved (so that they end up in a circle) when most people's bath tubs are rectangular?  Shouldn't the \\"street\\" just be straight and go all the way around the tub...unless this was designed for kids to stand up and put these on the tile wall...which is a safety hazard in a wet tub.  Don't get it.  So, you can't really connect all the street pieces and have your child sit down while playing.  Poor design, in my opinion.<br /><br />2) The car, bus, and airplane stickers do not stick very well to the side of the tub, even when wet.  They do stick great onto the street pieces, but as I just mentioned...once you put them on the street...the street then falls in the tub.<br /><br />I bought this because it got such great reviews, I'm really wondering if the people who liked this just got a different product than I did.<br /><br />The *only* reason I gave it 2 stars and not \\"0\\" stars is that my son and daughter (2 yr old twins) still like to play w/the pieces independently (not as stickers, but they treat them like boats) so....for that I give it 2 stars.  Disappointed though...
B004FOA84A|1.0|sounds like a good game but i never got a chance to play. force close everytime. even tried to uninstall and then reinstall. dont bother. lg ally
B001BGTWXI|1.0|All hope of these guys making another heavy album really is gone. From the first 2 releases were my favorites. But to me it seems that Corey Taylor cant keep his 2 bands separate. The last 2 albums have been a more SlipSour than a Slipknot. I mistakenly bought this album in hopes that I would be reminded on why I loved the music these guys made. Just been disappointed with every release that these guys have put out after Iowa. They lost their edge in my eyes and have no energy like they used to.<br />So i snuffed this album on my computer desk as a beer coaster.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Frozen. The actors were great, the story plot made sense and the movie was just overall enjoyable to watch. I give it 5 stars because this movie will definitely keep you on your toes. Great movie!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Best radio app download so far. Lots of choices for indian radio...itsgot vividh bharti too.    I like radio NRI . I DON'T LIKE THIS 25 word minimum thing on amazon review..
B004XDYJRU|3.0|The app itself is cool.  I like being able to pause, rewind and record songs; even rewind to previously played songs.  However most of my favorite stations in Pittsburgh are blocked.  The defeats the purpose of being able to listen to your favorite stations while you are away.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Game was fun and some of the clues took a bit of thinking. Overly it is a good game, but it was much too short and left me wanting more.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Even though my Droid X already has FM available, it only plays with headphones attached. With this app, I can listen anytime.  One very interesting feature (at least for my location) is the availability of several local police and fire scanner stations. Didn't expect that!  Perhaps they are always available on AM band, but since I never listen to AM radio, I couldn't say. Definitely an app worthy of downloading.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Found the major stations in my market without really having to do anything. Did a search for Art Bell and found a replay station.   Pretty happy.   Works great on my Nook Color!
6305428220|5.0|The Faculty is a fun and exciting sci-fi movie that will keep you watching it from beginning to end. I enjoyed this movie when it first came out and I haven't seen it since. I purchased this DVD and still enjoy the movie! Great movie!
B002VPE1AW|2.0|This movie's not that great.  I think, in my opinion, people only like this movie because they are blinded by the awesome special effects which contain realistic new native creatures along with a huge computer-generated world.  It's amazing.  But beyond the special effects, there's not much going for this movie.  It's your simple, \\"man goes undercover to get trusted by a civilization in order for the company he works for to get something worth billions of dollars from them, but ends up befriending them and has change of heart\\" story.  The characters are really annoying at certain parts and there are unnecessary amounts the Avatar's flying on these dragon-like creatures to dazzle the audience, and they fell for it.  I saw this movie in 2D and this is what I saw.  People who saw it in 3D like it better because of the 3D visuals.  I give this movie 2 stars for the special effects and how much work James Cameron put into this movie, but coming from him, you'd expect something with more story and likable characters, like the Titanic.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I got this for free on the deal of the day, but after playing it, I would even pay for this game.  Great time waster with short minute long timed games or longer ones to see how long you can play before missing too many.
B004FOA84A|5.0|A great brain tease of a mystery game. Those that claim that they beat it in a half hr most likely hit google as soon as they got stuck on something. With no access to any resource or hints, this game will run you a few hours of play easily. i got it for free but i am willing to say that it's well worth the purchase.
B004FOA84A|5.0|works just fine on HTC thunderbolt. simple setup and somewhat easy but none the less still and enjoyable game for free app of the day.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This is a very fun puzzle game with nice graphics, but waaaay short.  You can probably beat this game in less than an hour.  But a good value for the price.
B004FOA84A|5.0|really enjoyed the game.  like a flashback to the classic Lucas arts day of the tentacle type of games.  had to cheat on the clock and was kicking myself afterwards so try to do it on your own if you can
B004HO6I4M|3.0|The movie was entertaining enough.  It wasn't as good as the Shrek movies or even Blue Sky's other movies like Ice Age, Robots or Horton Hears a Who, but it was good enough.   The animation was nice and colorful.  It did have some moments wear you'd laugh out loud.  It had a good voice cast and some good musical numbers.  The only thing wrong with this movie is that there are way too much characters they wanted to put the spotlight on.  I mean, you have the main birds, Blu and Jewell, but they get overpowered by George Lopez' character along with Will.i.am and Jaime Foxx.  Not to mention that there are 3 different plots going on all at once which makes it hard for character development.  The moments with the poachers who kidnap Blu and Jewell and the parts with the annoying parrot Nigel could have been cut down significantly with keeping the same idea because I thought they brought down the movie.  Anne Hathaway, who is one of my favorite actresses of all time doesn't really too much to do as Jewell, even when she finally sings, Will.i.am and Jaime Foxx have to come in and rip some cool techno beats.    I love cartoons and I watch every animated movie that comes out, this one was a little disappointing, but it's still watchable.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Loved this book! Had such incredible spiritual messages woven within. Perfect for young adults. Will be reading everything this author has.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|I think that people have a bad memory. When the original Star Wars came  out, it was not universally loved as some people today believe it was.  Sure, now, 34 years later, you can hardly find someone who doesn't  claim \\"Star Wars\\" to be a film classic. But when it was first released  in 1977, it was about as loved as Episode I was in 1999 - roughly half  loved it and half hated it. It is interesting that nowadays people will  talk about how amazing the original trilogy of films were and how  terrible the new films are. But people don't seem to remember that they  share most of the same characteristics. Here are some examples of what  I mean:     - I hate to say it, but the writing in the original trilogy is hardly  Oscar-worthy material. The lines were cliché-ridden but serviceable to  progressing the story. Same with the new films.    - The movies were geared towards kids. Wookies, Jawas, Hutts, and  comedic robots aren't exactly grown-up fare. We think these films were  more mature than the prequels, but only because they matched our  maturity when we first saw them as children or teens.    - The movies are indeed special effects movies. The only reason the  original films didn't use computer graphics is because CGI wasn't  practical at the time. Had it been, Lucas surely would have utilized it  to its fullest advantage.    - Both trilogies have political underpinnings. These may be more  apparent in the prequels, but are definitely present in the original  movies.    - In the end, they are all just movies, and rather silly ones at that.    Now, I am writing this as someone who loves Star Wars as much as the  next guy. They are my favorite movies. But I acknowledge that they are  just movies and they are not meant to be grand works of art. They are  meant to be a fun, entertaining, effect-filled diversion. And to that  end, all of the movies are successful. Obviously some episodes are  superior to others, but they are each enjoyable in their own way.  Nostalgia is the primary reason that the original films are held in  such high regard. If we really view these films objectively, perhaps  the original films are not as perfect as we remember and the prequels  are not as flawed as we think.
0743497465|4.0|This was a great read, a classic Dan Brown.  His style keeps you hooked. If you liked any of his other hits you will enjoy this thriller.  (Spoiler) Just remember, it is not who you most suspect; it is not who you least suspect; it is who you most medium suspect.
B00009UTQD|5.0|Was starting to get a few too many filters than what I could store in my camera bag with them still in their cases. This was especially true of a few that came with step down rings (making for a really thick case).  As such I went looking for something to hold my filters without the cases. The case is good and well padded.  Each filter has its own slot so no filter is unintentionally touching another one.  The pack itself is design for multiple sized filters and as such is a little on the big size for the 58MM I use. I would like it a little smaller so it would be big enough to protect the filters but no so big that I have a hard time reading what filter is what.  That being said if you are storing filters on the larger size it will work just fine. The pack itself seams well constructed, The cover has stayed on well, and there is a belt loop. If you have (or anticipating having) a large number of filters than you may want something else.  This can store five filters just fine (meeting my needs) and if you need to you can screw two of the same size together and put the pair in a slot, if the filters are thin enough you could get away with this. Overall this product works and meets the hobbyist needs.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|If you've already seen past zombie movies or shows than you already know the story of this series,  you have a standard day in Japan when for whatever reason the dead have come back to life and are now attacking and eating the living and now those few living survivors must try and stay alive and find some safe shelter or else face the possibility of becoming the zombies next meal.  The series mostly focuses on about six teenagers from the same highschool as well as the school nurse and a young girl they save later on from the zombies,  and pretty much as seen by the trailers and online about all the females are beyond well endowed except understandably the young girl.  Again as expected the series will give you double the usual dose of fan service beyond what we've seen with most animes and even though it's hinted at of some sexual romantic relationships there not shown on the show so the only r-rated scenes you'll see other than the violence from the zombies is the standard topless scenes and panty shots.  The characters are enjoyable to watch and there are some dramatic serious scenes that play out between the group of teen survivors as they worry about their situation and their families they don't know are even alive or dead or more terrifying have become the walking undead,  but again if you've seen past survivor/zombie movies or shows than most of the series will feel like you're just watching one of those which is pretty much true.  The animation and soundtrack are great for the series and the Japanese voice cast are great in their character roles but sadly for the English dubbed was less than stellar while for the most part the dubbing is decent there are a few they should have recast for the character roles.  I give the series five stars in that I already seen the series online and pretty much expected it to be what it was,  So if you like the standard zombie movies but now in anime format here's a pretty decent choice but for any truly original characters or storyline you will be somewhat disappointed....ters or storyline you will be somewhat disappointed....
B004FOA84A|4.0|Good game, just a little on the short side,  thanks grandpa,  can we have a sequel? I liked the puzzles would be nice if it was creepy like 7th guest
0394818237|5.0|I love this book!  I had it as a child (still have it actually but it is in very bad shape).  I have so many fond memories of this book.  When I had my daughter I got her a copy.  She's now 2.5 yrs old and loves the book, too.  She will sit and \\"read\\" it on her own, pointing out the kitties and puppies and pigs and all the fruit & vegetables, etc.  She loves the story about the bread.  There is so much detail on every page.     This is an abridged version, though.  I did not realize that when I ordered it.  The one I had as a child (early 1980's) was a little longer and more detailed.  But it still is a really really great book.
B004FOA84A|5.0|i thought this was going to be a dumb game but it actually turned out to be one the the funnest i have ever played on a mobile phone  it really gets you to stop think, and observe.
006029647X|5.0|The Read-Aloud edition is an oversized book with bigger drawings and larger print-type. The story is not dumbed-down, or edited.<br /><br />Of course the sheer quality of the work itself is retained -- but the extra large sized print and illustrations are very helpful for the elderly or children.<br /><br />If you love Garth Williams' work, then you can really appreciate his excellent talent here, which is why I bought this edition. So far, I think only the first two books in the series are available in this size. Hopefully the rest will follow.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes every time, and doesn't run. I can't get to try the game. This is on a tmobile g2, stock froyo. Ended up installing.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|Well everyone thought he couldn't top his brother but here is some nice rock n roll with songs that are very catching !! Give it try you will be glad you did .
B004FOA84A|3.0|A fun reminder about why games are so much better than they were 20 years ago. If you want to spend an hour of you life on this, go for it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Didn't even get to try it. The app force closes immediately. I hope it gets fixed soon because I really want to play it, it looks and sounds fun.
030746363X|1.0|Let me start by saying that I read and enjoyed the 4-Hour Workweek, and read the 4-Hour Body with an open mind.  I tried a few tips and tricks in the book without any real success, but didn't think much of it.  Then I decided to give Occam's Protocol a real shot.  I bought all the supplements, and took careful measurements before starting.  My plan was to evaluate things on a day-to-day basis and keep a daily log of my experience.<br /><br />Over 10 days on the protocol, I went from 149.6 lbs of lean mass to 148.5 lbs (a change that could be explained by varying hydration levels or the other imperfections of bioimpedance measuring, but certainly indicates that I didn't GAIN the tremendous amount of weight promised in the 4-Hour Body).  There are a number of reasons I wouldn't have expected the kind of results mentioned in the book: I certainly didn't eat 3200 calories a day, and beyond that, the results in Tim's book can't be typical (if they're real at all).  But I consistently ate above my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and added significant amounts of milk and protein to my diet (enough to meet the eating instructions in the book, if not the specific numbers in \\"The Finer Points\\").  I also consistently took the supplements recommended in the book.<br /><br />I definitely followed the program's exercise requirements--sometimes going beyond the core program with additional sets to ensure total fatigue (but never additional sets outside of the prescribed workout days, or additional exercises outside of the program).  Each set was done to complete failure: my entire body shaking, limbs unable to push an inch further (I would hold it at this point for as long as possible, trying to move even a millimeter more).  And each set was performed at a 5/5 cadence or slower.<br /><br />So what do I think of Occam's Protocol?  Well, I think it's BS.  Maybe if you've never exercised in your life, or have the right kind of genetics/metabolism, there's a way to see real gains from it, but I don't believe those gains are going to be ALL muscle.  Of the bloggers I've been following who've tried the protocol, many have either modified it significantly to see results (switching to a 5×5 plan, for example) or have gained fat (this compared to this) as well as muscle.<br /><br />Honestly, I think Tim Ferriss applied the principals of his first book to his second: outsource the work, and then package it and sell it.  The diet is essentially a mix of Atkins, Paleo and South Beach Diet (as noted by another Amazon reviewer); the workout is a modified version of the StrongLifts program (with some ideas from various exercise coaches thrown in for good measure); and the recommended supplements are a combination of ones common for weight training (like Whey and Creatine), and some less documented (that seem to be based on obscure or disputed research).  The book is written in a similar style and with the same attitude as the first, which is what drew me to it in the first place, but I think that's the best I can say for it.  Tim's attitude is right: be skeptical, test, document, tweak, reexamine.  But his recommendations don't pass his own litmus test.<br /><br />I think I'll end this review just shy of calling the book snake oil.  Maybe there was some snake oil mixed in with the dye used to print the book...  It's an interesting read, and there are certainly little tips and tricks that may be useful, but of all the techniques I've tried (including Occam's Protocol and others), absolutely none have worked.  If you want to gain tons of muscle, you're going to have to hit the gym with a solid exercise plan and solid eating.  Don't worry about fads.  Don't worry about supplements.  Work hard, be careful, and you'll do just fine.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I moved away from where I grew up and my sports teams aren't broadcast on television here very often, if at all. TuneIn allows me to catch all the action easily and efficiently on my phone. It's as simple as pressing the sports option in the menu then selecting the sport and the team.     Love this app. Pro version is worth the money to be able to record programs too.
1416549447|5.0|Background: I used to get injured all the time, until I read Danny Dryer's book. I implemented the forms he teaches and have been injury free for 3+ years, also shaving off 15 MINUTES off of my half marathon time to get to the 1:30 half marathon mark. I have read the book, seen the DVDs, and even took a few Chi running classes.     However, like the title of the review says, skip everything except chapter 4. It teaches the form, the centering, and the posture needed to implement chi running. Everything else is metaphysical bullcrap. I am not sure if any of his methods are related to Chi of any kind, but implementing the forms REALLY helps.
0307593495|5.0|Besides being a wonderful mystery series, the development of the character of Kurt has been fascinating to watch.      I finished reading the book last night.  All I could do was sit and think about the ending.  This morning I read the last page again and realized that I am feeling sad for Kurt, just as if he was a \\"real\\" friend.
0937381888|5.0|This book is a MUST HAVE if you brew your own beer especially if your new to homebrewing as I am. It is very in-depth and easy to read with lots of pictures and charts. There are quite a few tasty recipes. It covers almost everything you need to know to make your own great beer. I say almost because it doesn't have anything about kegging at all, but that's easily looked up on the internet and not really complicated. If your thinking about starting to brew your own beer get this book you won't regret it. I look at it everytime I start a new brew.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have a Droid x and color nook and this app works flawlessly. Love it. If you listen to your radio from your tablet or phone this is the only app you will need.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|This is his best in some time.  Simon refuses to become an \\"oldies\\" act like his contemporaries.  Buy this CD.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Saw this on the plane back from Japan and, wow, a more fragile, focused performance you will not see from Portman anytime soon. Beautiful symbolism and cinematography at every step. Very painful to watch at times, but I couldn't turn away.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Looks like it is recording. But when I go to Recordings, the wheel spins for ever, never be able to play any recordings.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Scream is Ozzy's best album since No More Tears. The band is great and Gus G is a nice surprise. I bought the Scream CD when it was released and later on I also bought the Scream Tour Edition CD. Highly recommended!!! Excellent!!!
B004DCB62M|5.0|I agree that the Table of Contents could be better. However, I found it easy to \\"search\\" the book for a word or phrase that is in the title.    I still give it 5 stars since I love these stories, and the almost unnavigable table of contents really isn't a big problem.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I can't imagine why the rating is so low on this game. I think it is a blast. I got stumped a few times but I put it down, took a break, went back to it and finished it within several hours. It was awesome that it was free but, if I knew how much fun it was, I would have gladly paid for it! Here's going the developers come ouy with the sequel soon!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Can't even open the app.  Force close every time.  Droid x 2.2.  Looking at the other reviews, im not the only one having problems.  I'm not sure how they could release a broken app this
B004FOA84A|1.0|finished this entire game in less than an hour. I am highly disappointed. it is a very good thing I got this as a free app of the day or I would feel cheated. As it is I feel slightly cheated for downloading and wasting my time playing such a short game
B004FOA84A|5.0|this is a fun game.  had one force close.  just restarted the app and no issues.  game is short kinda glad i didnt buy it though.   look forward to more games like this.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Thunderbolt.  Seamless app.  Can add favorites.  Quality is decent.  I really enjoy listening to the radio stations back home.  Great when a radio isn't handy.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I love the idea of good quality puzzle storyline games coming to Android so I was excited to see this one for free.  But the tons of crashes &amp; force closes make it unplayable.  once it froze my phone completely &amp; I had to reboot. Needed a lot more bug fixes before going live to this big of an audience.  Worthless as it is, so sadly 1 star &amp; uninstalled.
B004FOA84A|5.0|super fun game and it works perfectly on my HTC Evo 4g. Too bad it got so many bad ratings because it force closed on phones.. its a great game
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the 25th anniversary DVD -- I also own the 10th Anniversary DVD which probably says something about how I enjoy the music from Les Mis.
0872860175|5.0|Our public library had \\"Howl\\" as it's book club selection. Many couldn't get over the salty language. I thought it was a profoundly religious work and loved it. Ginsberg really knew how to paint a picture with words. A first rate work with a lot to say - just be open to a dose of life.
B004G6009U|5.0|Finally a family film that is as interesting and fun to watch for me as it my children, Tangled. On the day of its arrival my children were on edge for me to open it up and pop it in our blu-ray player. Of course I was glad to since mommy can always use an hour or so of quite time. While I rushed about the house, I found myself peeking more and more at the tv. Finally I did it; I sat right down on the couch and watched the rest of the show.<br /><br />At that moment Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) makes an appearance in Rapunzel's tower to hide from the king's army. This is the point where you see the childish nature of Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) which continues throughout the film. This nature really helps my younger children connect with her character and in turn keeps them interested in each of her adventures.<br /><br />As Flynn is stuffed unconscious in the Rapunzel's closet, she makes a final plea to the only mother she knows to leave the tower for her birthday to see the lights. Mother Gothel (voiced by the lovely Donna Murphy) proceeds to tell Rapunzel that it is for her own safety and protection that she has been locked in the tower. Not only does she stress this in speech but also in song. \\"Mother Knows Best; Listen to Your Mother!\\" is my favorite part in the movie because even though Mother Gothel is a terrible villain, she does add a bit of parental knowledge here.<br /><br />I as a mom really enjoyed Rapunzel and I even watched it on my own while my children were at school. For a grown woman as busy as this mom of 4 is that is a huge thing. There is alot of action, comedy and of course a little bit of true love all in one with Disney's Tangled.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I purchased this before the app give away and I do not regret the purchase.  The comments travel well from desktop to device to dropbox and back to the desktop.  I have not been able to get the freehand annotation to work, but that may be because, I am only on version 1.24.  It seems that the newest version is not on Amazon.    The amazon market does not seem to have all the latest versions and at least for me, the updates are sporadic.  This is a big problem, when it is not noted in the product description that what you are about to buy is permanently behind. So my biggest gripes are with the Amazon Android Market.    I'm hoping I eventually get the annotation feature and if I have to repurchase it from google, to do so,  I will.  It's just that good.     Requested enhancements: I would like it to be able to read all the attached storage devices and not just the device mounted as /sdcard/.  With tablets and the possibility of have additional sdcards (as I have with my NI Adam) and also usb drives, it would nice to pick up all the pdf docs with the search.    It's not quite as smooth as goodreader on the iPad, but it I like what I see so far.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I had a great time playing this... I wish it were a bit longer, but I really enjoyed the 30 minutes it took me to figure every thing out.
0553582461|2.0|I regret the time I invested in all 9 of the books in this series, as the ending was an incredible disappointment. Just like in Assassin's Quest, major events are quickly summarized, many of the character decisions are random & completely different from what was foreshadowed, and most disappointingly, emotionally important characters are tossed aside to avoid a complicated ending.<br /><br />I would not recommend these to a friend. I won't deny that Hobb does a wonderful job making us invest in these characters, but that's why it is so disappointing to see the way they actually go.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Works well and has all the radio stations I like. I work outside the range of the station I listen to and with this I get radio qualty without the static
B004P9FAK2|5.0|What people need to understand is that it ISN'T UP TO WARNER BROS or the Company that releases films on DVD/BD to include a director's cut!! They can't just make up an extended version by cobbling togetehr deleted scenes and include it on the disc. The original DIRECTOR of the films has to be commissioned by the Production studio to come back and essentially re-edit the film and create a new transfer, essentially creating a new version.     Most director's don't have time for this process. Chris Columbus was able to because, as of late, he doesn't seem as busy and the subsequent directors. David Yates has been busy creating the momumentally epic conclusion to this series and unfortunately, that didn't allow him the time to come up with director's extended cuts in time for the studio's release dates for 5 and 6.     As for 3 and 4, there NEVER WAS any director's extended cuts, as the director's of those films stated that what was released in theatres was their intended vision. David Yates may have meant to include more, but ultimately he never was able to make time as he has a wonderful final installment to get made.     Read the books, watch the deleted scenes and shut up! These are still ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITIONS because each contains the ONLY VERSION of 3,4,5 and 6 that exist. If you want extended cuts, become a director, do a remake and then see how easy it is to fight the studio in charge of theatrical distribution. THEY control the money and the decisions. Different entity than the distributors for the home video editions. Warner Bro's has done a wonderful things by giving us these editions to cherish. So quit your complaining.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Why should I have an opinion of 25 words if the app will not open. If only one star, you should drop the word minimum.
B0017HPHBM|4.0|La pel&iacute;cula es la batman que a todos nos gusta y en una presentaci&oacute;n que se ve muy linda al lado del reproductor. Los extras son muy buenos incluyendo el \\"Tankman! de los MTV awards. L&aacute;stima para los que no hablamos ingl&eacute;s que los extras no traen subt&iacute;tulos.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes on htc EVO4G.  Uninstalled because does not work for me.  No problem running any other games or apps. Rooted but still using Sense so it shouldn't matter.  25 word minimum reviews are stupid.  This needed 5.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|works good but I noticed that each of the 3 times I had the app open today it force closed often on my thunderbolt. please fix soon.
0618477942|5.0|This book arrived about 2 or 3 days after I ordered it, which was faster than estimated. It was carefully packaged and was in perfect condition. I am 100% satisfied with the entire process. :)
B004FOA84A|1.0|app crashes on xoom (wifi). not sure if the person who got it to work was on 3G. Force close when I try to run.
B001EN71DG|3.0|El box es complet&iacute;simo, incluyendo la versi&oacute;n original de cine y la remasterizada de cada pel&iacute;cula.<br />El &uacute;nico problema para los fan&aacute;ticos de latinoam&eacute;rica es que no traen subt&iacute;tulos en espa&ntilde;ol. La versi&oacute;n original trae audio espa&ntilde;ol pen&iacute;nsular y la remasterizada trae un audio espa&ntilde;ol latino donde Darth Vader habla de corrido y es a&uacute;n m&aacute;s plano que el audio espa&ntilde;ol peninsular.<br /><br />Por otro lado, si usted es angloparlante o entiende ingl&eacute;s, es 100% recomendable.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The best radio player. I can listen to live radio any where in the world. Thank you for adding the record feature. Loving the android version as much and the apple one now. Thank you!!!!
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|There was a lot left unexplored in this film, although the premises were very interesting.  I felt a little let down with the simplicity of the story line.  I like the actors very much, and the recreation of the tsunami was believable, especially in light of the footage we have seen since Japan's tragedy.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD and the timliness of the receipt were very good and I would definately purchase from this vendor again and again.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Really fun for a few minutes then it force closes. I tried opening it again and it did the sae thing agin and again. Very disappointed...
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I'm loving this app I just wish they had app to sd option So I can save some space in my phone other than that it's a perfect App for listening to the radio especially coast to coast and alex jones info wars. Thank you so much for your time and thank you amazon for Making this free
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|La pel&iacute;cula definitiva con todo lo que no debieron cortarle en el cine. La presentaci&oacute;n es bastante linda con frente hologr&aacute;fico.<br />L&aacute;stima para los de hablaispana que los extras no traen subt&iacute;tulos.
B002ZG9846|4.0|It's very different movie. I like story, Star cast and their acting, specially Cole Grace Moretz as a hit girl.  About Product, DVD & BD quality are great. DC work fine in my PC. Thank to Amazon. com for delivering  product within time
B004FOA84A|3.0|This is a great game, very addictive. It force closes atleast half the time on my htc evo though when trying to run it. Please try to fix this issue! :(
B00110K62U|5.0|DVD is a must-own. Every performance is incomprehensibly brilliant. If you are unconvinced, go to Youtube right now and watch some of these performances! (Who Am I, I Dreamed a Dream, On My Own, Bring Him Home, all absolutely stunning)<br /><br />DREAM CAST INDEED! It really can't get any better than this.<br /><br />Don't let the negative reviews deter you! I was concerned about the quality complaints, but I'm so glad I bought this anyway. I'm 100% satisfied with the quality of the sound and picture.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any fan of music!
B004XDYJRU|3.0|It worked the first time i tried it. unfortunately on the second time, it refuses to show any stations, instead just returning the error message &quot;an error occurred&quot;
0060594888|5.0|MY COPY of the book has no marks, its in perfect condition, WITH JACK CANFIELD'S SIGNATURE.. I m in love with this copy already. A true value for money. SUPER DUPER FAST SHIPPING. Thanks Seller.. you are the best.. n i hope to purchase more from you in coming years. Thanks Amazon :)
B004FOA84A|2.0|Downloaded today and I'm consistently met with an application error that causes a force close.  I am operating on a LG Vortex and this is the first app to fail on my device. Hoping for an update soon, so I can actually play.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Need help just use your brain. Its pretty simple, I'm sad it finishes so quickly. In order to equal the scale you have to solve  the globe. You will need to use the poster in the study room and the letters on the refrigerator. Don't wanna give to much away. Hope this helps.
B000LC51TM|5.0|It is obvious that Rammstein is passionate about putting up a great and spectacular live concert, that will even impress the non fans.  The energy, the stagework, the pyrotechnics, the ferocity, the occasional goofy actings and the sync between band members, all contribute to making this concert a blast to watch.  In fact, I personally think that the band sounds much better during live than in studio.  The personnel in charge of the making of the dvd/cvd had also done a great job switching the focus between the different band members and the audience.  If there is any flaw in this dvd, it will be the part on Moscow, which is a total joke, given the weak camera angles, and the lame cheerleaders singing on the stage.  Though that only conributes to 5% of the whole disc, so no real damage done.  All in all, a very good buy.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Debated on wether to even download. I usually use Pandora.  But this app is pretty good. Stations all over the world.  Plus all my locals.  Have only tried on WiFi so far.  If it works as well on 3G,  10 stars!
B004FOA84A|2.0|First off doesn't work with Xoom, worked with Nexus 1. Very simple Myst-esque game that can be finished within an hour. No real sense of accomplishment after beating. Only worth it if you get it for free.
B00464CU7M|1.0|This is by far the worst Popera/Classical Crossover DVD that I've ever seen and I have a large collection of them. I simply threw this out it's so bad. Katherine Jenkins has a great mezzo voice and a wonderful personality that sparkles in her two previous DVDs. Her \\"Live In the park\\" and \\"Live at Llangollen\\" DVDs are exceptional. Her CDs are exceptional. In this DVD, her voice is totally lost to over boosted background music.     Her producer is also sending Jenkins down the sad \\"Sarah Brightmann path\\" of performing in extreme floor shows with extreme lighting and dancers that are totally unrelated to why people like the performer and buy her music.     If you want to purchase a DVD of full of background music played by unknowns, a bunch of unknown dancers, a light show that makes it difficult to see Katherine Jenkins and you do not want to hear her sing, this is the DVD for you!
B0018OAPAW|4.0|Gone is the humor present in the album Splinter, The Offspring is back with this album, being more serious and some notable changes in the music direction.  For the first few songs until Kristy, they are full of energy, variations (which is a good thing since their songs had been sounding the same after Ixnay, though things got better with Splinter).  There may be variations, but note that the distinct fast and furious Offspring's style of music is atill present.  However, the later songs of the album start to fall into the trap of sounding the same and tend more towards Simple Plan's style than Offspring's.  Though this is still a good buy since the first part of the album is excellent.
0061353248|5.0|I am not usually into psychology, sociology, or marketing books, but I enjoyed this one. Kind of all three topics rolled into one. Shows you why we make the decisions that we do and breaks things down into very simple detail that anybody can follow. Everything from why we buy the houses we do, to why people pay (or don't pay) premium prices on event tickets is covered here.    If you're interested in what makes humans the way we are, I think you'll enjoy this book.
B004FOA84A|1.0|this does not work on my droid x with liberty 2.0.1. would definitely like to try it out, but cant be mad since amazon got the bill on this one!
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a great game for people that have limited time to play games. I finished it in about an hour and thoroughly enjoyed it. I will gladly pay for future releases from this developer.  Sad to see people giving this low scores because their phone force closes it. Let the developer know what phone you have so they can fix with an update! It's dishonest to review a game that you haven't played.
B004FOA84A|1.0|It keeps force closing upon opening. Have uninstalled and reinstalled and still force closes. I am hoping it gets fixed soon. I am using a Lg venus.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Better than shoutcast, great for when you need a break from the same old stuff. Plus the record feature is cool. Using it on my evo 4g
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Intuitive UI. Stations are properly organized. I can even find Hong Kong radio shows to stream! International streaming can be choppy once in a while, but it's way better than none!   Highly recommended.   - myTouch 4G
B004FOA84A|5.0|Lots of fun just wish it was a bit longer or more difficult.  Reminds me a lot of the Myst series!  I beat this game in about half an hour.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Amazing graphics! Kept my attention. Awesome storyline... I was determined to complete it had to know what a the clues lead to. Would love to see a part two. Keep up the good work! Cellular South HTC Desire
B00408MS5S|5.0|This is the best Supertramp album ever, period. Some fans will lay claim to CRIME OF THE CENTURY, and it is a great album, but BIA is amazing. One of the best rock albums of all time. It wasn't intended as a concept album, but the musical style is so prevalent throughout the album and the themes go together so well that you could read it as one and it would fit. Every song is a winner. There were a total of 5 radio hits off of this album. The theme is decadence and decline in Western civilization, particularly in the US. It is the catchiest pop/jazz/rock music ever recorded. It incorporates their earlier style into a pseudo Euro gypsy/carnival sound that gives the listener a perspective of being somewhere in Europe while listening to the stories about American life. It has sold over 18 million copies worldwide and I've never grown tired of it. This deluxe edition comes with some interesting, albeit forgettable live cuts. It was cool to listen to Child Of Vision live, but they simply didn't pull it off. PARIS is the place to go for one of the finest live albums any artist ever recorded. The performances there are even better than the originals in many cases. But coming back to BIA; This album will amaze any art-rock enthusiast. Even the cover is quirky and clever. The remastering on the deluxe version is clearer than the previous remastering, but the vocals sound kind of buried in the mix and the highs are now a little shrill. It's too bad that the deluxe version was overproduced; it would've been nice to be able to better appreciate the rest of the clearer reproduction. This is a must for all fans of art-rock and classy jazz-pop.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I have to admit that I was a bit reluctant to start reading these books. I know it will sound lame, but before I've mostly liked books about the cookie cutter fantasy; dwarves, elves, dragons, magic ect. While in this series there are Dragons... and magic is there but is very hidden and mysterious, It just blows my mind when the plot just takes a turn in a completely opposite direction that you never saw coming but works out so well you ask yourself why you didn't think of that yourself... Excellent stories. Very realistic in a way that will keep you reading and waiting very unpatiently for the next book to come out... I highly recommend this book, heck even episode 1 of the HBO series Game of Thrones is very good... You can tell Mr. Martin had his hand in the making of it unlike Terry Goodkind with the Legend of the Seeker, based off of Wizards first Rule and Stone of Tears... When episode 1 of that show came on, the beginning was SOOOOOOOOOOOO Different than the book but had the same type of situations it hurt my brain... I have a feeling before the end this series is going to be verryyy big.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Downloaded today and am really enjoying the puzzles. Graphics are excellent. Runs fine on the Thunderbolt. Will look for more games like this in the future
B004ISVH5W|4.0|Richard, the voice behind the epic and legendary band The Verve, is back with a new sound but still as melodic and brutally honest as ever! Richard, besides his out of this world voice, is able to write some of the most amazing lyrics that touch  not only your inner self, consciousness and heart, but that place where very few dare to expose or talk about! My only regret is  he doesn't put out more music more often..then again, this kind of music and honesty is worth waiting for- a lifetime! From Alone With Everybody to this latest effort..Richard takes you on a journey..feels your pain, relates to you..uplifts you!    Thanks, Richard..you're still the man, bro!!    Let my soul rest!!!!!!!!!!!
B004FOA84A|4.0|I love this game! It's fun, creative and the puzzle clues are very fun!! The only thing I want different is more activities!! I hope they make a new version soon :-)
1932100385|5.0|This is a very convincing agrument for not eating meat and dairy. I have sent copies to 4 people and eat person no longer eats meat and dairy after completing the book. I think that says it all.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Have an Android and it force closes every time I try and use it. I even uninstalled it, reinstalled it and it still won't work. Glad I got it free.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I loved this game! Excellent buy. I finished the story (which was great by the way) in about an hour or so though. Wish i could play for days with harder puzzles.  would pay 5.00 dollars or more for a longer game of this type.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I honestly can't believe that this exists and its free (or $0.99) and the online account is free.  This basically replaces any chances for satellite radio or MLB app or NFL streaming BS.  Great work, easy interface and works pretty darn well.  Occasionally, I'll get the station unavailable, but hey, its streaming radio over 3G from across the country.  Now I can keep up with my Cardinals!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love that this has no ads, & i got it for free. The original Angry Birds in the android market is free, but has ads that take up the screen. So definite plus that this doesn't.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed this little puzzle game. out was indeed short and has very little replay value but it was with going through. Not sure I would have wanted to party for it. Samsung vibrant.
0307272702|5.0|Just bought the book and looking forward to reading it more - THANK YOU for writing this and the NY Times article!!! I've been telling everyone about the book and the article and Dr. Robert Lustig's youtube video - I'm a believer!!! Wish I could do more to get the word out - it's a shame so many people suffer by following the unhealthy way of eating. I've been doing low carb for years - lost a lot of weight - but had been doing low fat and struggled with cravings and setbacks. Now on Day 4 of your diet and no cravings and I feel satisfied and great!!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've used other radio apps, including Wunderadio, and this is by far the best combination of quality and quantity available.  This is a great choice for sports fans, especially hockey fans, and is perfect for listening to your home stations when on the road.
159420229X|2.0|I feel I was mislead by the advertisement. I was not interested in the quest of someone else for improving their memory. I was interested in improving mine. I did not read the book...I just skimmed through it. It is a waste of money and is a dust collector.
B004FOA84A|2.0|DROIDX GB. If I start the app horizontally and then rotate landscape it force closes. If I start landscape it works. After that hitting the screen lock it continues to play music. Turning the screen on and going home music is still playing. I had to force close it to make it stop. Free it's worth a shot but at a buck I would pass.
B004FOA84A|4.0|It did force close on my Galaxy S phone once, but runs fine now. Cute game, good graphics, clever puzzles. It is short, but what do you want for a dollar? My problem is that objects vanish if you find another one that falls in the same bag slot. Makes it no fun to replay. :(
1594202842|2.0|Like a lot of people I have heard about the controversy that this book stirred up. So I decided to see what the deal was and checked this book out from the local library. At this point I am more than half way through and I don't what is worse her boder line abusive parenting or her juvenile style of writing. Amy Chua is a Chinese woman that has decided that she wants to raise her half white, half Chinese daughters in the so called \\"Chinese\\" way. If we are to believe correctly the Chinese way of raising children is to force them to practice either the violin or piano whether they want to or not, and if they are less than perfect then you have the right to call them names like pathetic or garbage. She even talks about at one point of her life where she rejects her daughter's homemade birthday cards because they weren't up to her standards.    I would have been more likely to forgive these things if the book was a well written, learning experience about parenting and culture. What Amy Chua gives us is a poorly written book that I have a hard time believeing was written by a woman that graduated Harvard and is now a Professor of Law at Yale. One thing that really got to me is that she is all about the Chinese life style when she will taunt and look down upon her mother-in-law behind her back, last time I checked isn't a huge part of the Chinese culture is to respect your elders? I am probably going to finish this book, but after that I am probably never going to touch this book ever again.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Awesome! Works great on my phone mt4g no force closes. Awesome brian teaser. Already beat it, but couldn't put it down until I did. Can't wait for more levels.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Everyone should see this documentary. The government needs to reign in wall street and never bail them out again. No one has been indicted or convicted of anything after having gambled people's pensions, etc. The Congress needs to re-instate the \\"Glass-Stegall Act.\\" There needs to be rules and they need to be re-enforced and obeyed.

0312360258|4.0|Zoey Redbird, a young girl just trying to get through life as a normal teenager. Unfortunately, for her, that just wasn't how her life was going to turn out. When marked by an adult vampyre, Zoey must now continue her teenage life as a fledgling in the House of Night. By being so overcome with mixed emotions and many decisions to make Zoey is more concerned with not being \\"normal\\" anymore that she has no idea of what obstacles await for her.     This is a great book for the young adult reader, because it gets right inside of the average teenagers mind. You are able to sense where the foreshadowing is laid out for future reads in this series, which really gets you mind thinking. The conversation between characters is wonderful, and relationships are stated right away. The side conflicts give it a more realistic feel, especially if your dealing with the same situations in a real life setting. Overall a great book and I would definitely recommend it to other readers.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Gave it 1 star only because 0 wasn't an option. Force closed every single time I tried to open it. Good thing it was free today! And yes, I did reboot... Twice! Fix this and I might give a better review.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Everyone should see this documentary. It is so sad that Valerie's career ended because of greed and hate. She had worked so hard to be a good agent and no one in the bush administration paid anything for what they did and Libby was pardoned by bush; what a travesty!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Gad a blast with the game. Cool puzzles that made you think. I only wish it was quite a bit longer, it did take me back to the myst days.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Being a great \\"Band\\" fan,  I never much cared for the Band members Solo work except for Robbie Robertson's 1st Solo and Rick Danko's 1st Solo.  I truly enjoyed every track on this CD.  The songs are well crafted as well as the music is well played.  I read someone's review here bashing Robreston's guitar playing,  my opinion is that it's just as good as it's always been.  I especally love his \\"inter-play\\" with Clapton.  I could find nothing wrong with this CD.<br />Thank you Robbie Robertson for such a great record!
B000G7PNAE|5.0|One of the greatest records of the early 80s.  No other band epitomized 80s rock better than Journey and this was the band at their peak.  From the easily-recognizable and hypnotic piano riff that opens Don't Stop Believing (remember the Sopranos?) to wonderful ballads like Who's Crying Now and Open Arms, this record has some of the band's best songs.  Journey could rock too, as it shows in the anthemic Stone In Love which features a wonderful guitar outro that is reminiscent of GNR's November Rain.  If you're only interested in their hits, try one of Journey's Greatest Hits collections.  But if you're looking to learn more about this wonderful band, this is the place to start.
0061906220|4.0|\\"I love my white shoes,\\" sings Pete the Cat as he walks down the street. A link on the publisher's web site leads to a downloadable dramatized reading of this colorful book, complete with a chorus of children singing Pete's song. Young listeners will quickly learn and recite not only the happy song but the narrative pattern of the repetitive story. Pete steps into a series of messes--\\"Oh no!\\"--staining his white shoes different colors. But \\"did Pete cry? Goodness no!\\" He simply changes the words of his song to suit each new circumstance. A funky typeface pulls the text into the bright, colorful paintings. With each new shoe disaster, a thought-bubble appears over the irrepressible cat's head: \\"Awesome!\\" \\"groovy!\\" \\"everything is cool!\\" These enthusiastic comments offer a humorous contrast to Pete's poker-faced expression. Accompanying Pete on his adventures is a big-eyed but silent little yellow bird who draws closer and closer, eventually perching on the cat's back.
B003UESJHE|5.0|This rather remarkable movie immediately made me very happy that I'm not a \\"Royal.\\" What a delight to have the freedom to choose one's own life path. The glitter and glitz of the royal life may seem desirable at first but has a dark underside which is clearly portrayed in this movie.<br /><br />Colin Firth does a compelling job as the future King George VI and dramatically portrays the challenges and difficulties he faced as he struggled to overcome some serious obstacles. One does not expect a royal child to suffer want and neglect but it seems that not even children of the nobility automatically escape these evils.<br /><br />The story starts just before the beginning of World War II and tells the story of the turbulent times that affected the royal family at both the political and emotional levels. It is fascinating to consider that these events were actually happening during the lifetimes of some of us.<br /><br />The casting is nigh unto perfect and all of the roles are beautifully played by seasoned members of the British theater. The movie is over so quickly as the story and the moving performances carry the viewer along as witnesses to a memorable period in world history.<br /><br />Watching the pictures of Hitler and the German army brought back many very uncomfortable thoughts; those of us who lived through that era can vividly remember the threat represented by those pictures. Not only was King George VI required to overcome some difficult personal problems, he had to assume leadership at a time of great challenge to not only England but the entire world.<br /><br />The movie is interesting at many levels; the acting, the scenery, the historic significance, and the sympathetic concern that is nurtured in the viewer as they watch the personal struggle the future King George VI experiences as he dutifully works to prepare himself for his assigned role in life.<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth the time it takes to watch it; I recommend it highly.
B004FOA84A|4.0|fun game worked just fine wish it was a little longer. looking forward to more titles like this game. wish this didn't have a twenty five word min. EVO
B004XDYJRU|5.0|so many great things about this radio app.  one of the coolest is that it shows the song that is playing currently on the list of radio stations.  great stuff!!!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Readers are readers and I really don't have much power-needs when it comes to reading PDFs, but there was one short-coming with Adobe's PDF reader, and that comes to bookmarking/outlining a document.    I work with the City Council Agendas with our local council and they rely on the bookmarks, which is where bookmarks become very useful and important.  While Adobe's android reader didn't recognize them, this reader did.    Looks good on my Evo, looks fantastic on the Zoom we have in the City.  And for a buck, you can't go wrong!
0736083863|5.0|Here is a book that makes sense in both its useful layout and excellent visuals.  As a Pilates instructor, I am always on the hunt for books that I can use as a resource and that can double as a teaching tool when shared with my students.  Pull out this book anytime you want to gain information about form, synergistic muscle relationships while performing the exercises, as well as the ever helpful Technique Cues and Exercise Notes that help to flesh out each exercise.  The very helpful Exercise Finder at the back of the book enhance this user-friendly book by Karen Clippinger and Rael Isacowitz.  What this book offers that so many others omit, is this:  Clear labels on each diagram...and fabulous illustrations.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really liked this game, but it was too short and a on the hard side with the clues. Some things I would never have gotten, if I hadn't used a help site.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Took about two hours to finish. Lots of fun for a buck. Hope they make more. Pretty easy but enjoyable with a handful of puzzles and thing to find. Wish it was a tad bit longer.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Ditto to all the previous reviews to this album. Unbelievably polished and I continue to be amazed at Dave's talent. Kudos on bringing back Pat Smear. He is the icing on the cake and makes this their best album to date.
B004QL7K8O|5.0|Truly the best time I've had at a movie in a long while.  My wife and I got lucky and got the last two tickets available at the Milwaukee Film Fest, and I'm so glad we got in.  Laughed our heads off (similar fate for many of the characters in the movie, minus the laughing).  I'm absolutely floored it hasn't gotten a US release.  It's funny, original, well-acted and directed - right there better than most movies.  Put this on your must-see list.
B004FOA84A|5.0|What do I do next?? Cant get past globe, the birds above fireplace, freezer, fridge abcs, drawer w/no knob &amp; drawer on step, locked door downstairs &amp; up &amp; in backyard, stump, candy machine. What do I do next? Ive been all over the place. Thank goodness app was free. I &lt;3stuff like this, but this 1has to be malfunctioning.
014241543X|5.0|I finished reading this book a few days ago and it was nothing short of amazing. I didn't like the writing style to begin with - I thought the present tense gave it a clunky feel, and I found it hard to relate to the characters. But after the accident I could see why this tense had been used, as we are plunged into some flashbacks of important scenes from Mia's life. It took me a couple of chapters to really get into it, but then I was hooked.     Mia is in an horrific car accident just 11 pages in. It's the premise of the book so it is to be expected, but I don't think I was expecting it to take place so early on. We then switch between the present where we are privy to Mia's commentary on what is happening to her body after the accident; and we are also transported into Mia's memories of both times that have only just taken place or times that have long since passed.     Music is a constant permeation in the story. Mia plays the cello, her boyfriend is lead singer and guitar player in an up and coming band, her father was a musician and her mother a part of the scene. I am not a musician but I loved the musical theme. It left a taste for listening to new and different sounds. It made me wish I had even an inkling of musical ability so I could take be a part of their world.     The characters are so likeable throughout the whole book. I loved Mia. I loved her boyfriend Adam and her parents and her brother Teddy. I loved Mia's recollections and her storytelling. I loved how she was so honest about her relationship with Adam. And I loved the way the emotion was raw and almost palpable. I cried and cried throughout this book - it really touched me.     At the end of the story Mia must decide whether she stays or she goes. She weighs up this decision throughout, and I found myself wishing that she would choose to stay but understanding if she would feel it too hard to continue. One part that had me crying was Mia's Gramps speaking to her comatose body and giving her permission to leave if that is what she wanted. He was such a lovely character in this book.     This book was short (compared to most novels these days) and it was sweet and raw and it hit its mark. I can't wait to read more by this author!
1936041111|1.0|Let me get this straight: I came to this book expecting a lot. Here is a book that has informed the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres for nearly two centuries; here is a book whose premise is deliciously provocative and brimming with moral and ethical dilemmas; here is a book which, I assumed, given its plot outline, dealt with such thorny questions as how far humankind must go when it comes to wielding the power of science, should a line be drawn at some point, or do we unbridle science and let it shape out society as we move forward into the future. Yes, I expected a lot from this book.<br /><br />Dr. Frankenstein is a young student who works hard for years to discover the ultimate secret: how to breathe life in a body devoid of one. How to animate a corpse. This is surely one of the grandest, most ambitious projects a scientist could ever embark upon. He spends his days and nights obsessed with his work and, finally, cracks the code of life. One stormy night, his creature, made of  body parts obtained from various dead bodies and stitched together to form a single, giant one, comes to life.<br /><br />Dr. Frankenstein has achieved that no human being in the history of mankind has even come close to: he has the power to bestow life. He can revive the dead. What is our good doctor's reaction when the creature opens his eyes for the first time ?<br /><br />Before I tell you about his reaction, here is what the doctor has to say about his education and background:<br /><br />\\"In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.<br /><br />Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.\\"<br /><br />So, our intrepid scientist is neither squeamish, nor superstitious. Keeping that in mind, here is his reaction when his creature comes to life (in his own words):<br /><br />\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.<br /><br />The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.\\"<br /><br />Ladies and gentleman, after achieving a break-through of stupdendous proportions in medical science, after breathing life into a dead body, our good doctor's first reaction is to describe the event as a `catastrophe.' Do you notice that instead  of talking about his accomplishment, its mechanics, and how it can change the future of mankind forever, he describes at great length the physical features of the creature.<br /><br />For Christ's sake, can somebody explain to me the significance of this ? How is the creature's physical beauty or lack thereof of any import whatsoever ?<br /><br />Wouldn't any scientist be dancing in the streets if he could merely bring back a cockroach to life, let alone a humanoid body ?<br /><br />Here is a scientist who has obsessed over his work for years and we have no explanation why he considers his success, when it finally arrives, a catastrophe. No explanation is ever provided.<br /><br />The doctor further tells us:<br /><br />\\"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.\\"<br /><br />Sleep ! The doctor went to his bedchamber to sleep ! Am I the only one who sees the ridiculousness of the situation here ? He has animated a dead body and instead of communicating with the creature, studying him, finding out about his brain, his mind, his thoughts, his physical and mental status, our good doctor wants to sleep.<br /><br />Once the doctor retires to his bedroom, the creature runs away. Throughout the book, the doctor refers to this unnamed creature as a fiend, a brute, an animal, the devil, a wretch, and we don't know why. I mean, within months of his creation, the creature is reading Greek historians such as Plutarch and writing critiques of such works as John Milton's `Paradise Lost' and he is considered an animal. Why ? Why ? Why ? No reason is ever given except that the monster doesn't look like Brad Pitt or George Clooney.<br /><br />Maybe Dr. Frankenstein was in the wrong profession, instead of a scientist, he should have been a cosmetic surgeon ?<br /><br />The creature then goes to Geneva and stumbles across, by pure chance, the younger brother of Dr. Frankenstein. What were the odds of this coincidence ?<br /><br />The population of Geneva circa 1780 was around 20,000 and our creature comes across a child who happens to be his creator's little brother. And on top of that, after he accidentally strangles the child, he roams around, enters a barn, where, again by pure chance, he encounters the child's governess who happens to be sleeping in that very barn. Coincidence upon coincidence. The creature had found a necklace on the child's person, which he places in the governess's pocket in order to mark her as the killer.<br /><br />And here is the best part, in the morning, the governess is caught with the necklace and sentenced to die. I mean, here is someone who raised the child, lived in the same household for years, she had ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted, but she decided to one day strangle the child in a public park, hide his body, keep the necklace in her pocket, and then let herself  be caught with it in the morning.<br /><br />People, are you laughing with me already ? Do you see the stupidity of this travesty of literature ? I am glad that Mary Shelley never decided in her life to write a legal thriller.<br /><br />The whole novel is full of such ridiculous co-incidences and logical inconsistencies.<br /><br />Later in the story, the creature confronts Dr. Frankenstein again and asks him to create a wife for him or else he would kill everyone in the doctor's family. The doctor reluctantly agrees, but later decides against it. Why does he decide against it ?<br /><br />Because the creature would have children with this female and the future generations of these monsters might take over the planet. The creature promised to take his wife and go to the jungles of South America where they would never come across humans again. This is a great chance for our doctor to get rid of the creature, he could have created a female creature, missing one or two organs vital to childbirth, and all would end well. His family wouldn't be threatened by the monster anymore, he wouldn't have to worry about the human race being taken over by the progeny of the creatues. But, no, the mind of our good doctor works in really mysterious ways, as we have seen, so far.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the creature expresses his desire to be among humans, he talks like a philosopher and a scholar, he makes it clear that he is not violent, all he wants is some comanionship, but the doctor refuses to hear any of this, and continues to refer to him as a wretch, a beast, and an animal. The only explanation ever given for this treatment is that the creature is not handsome.<br /><br />This was a laughably terrible book. Mary Shelley writes two, three sentences describing the most important event of the story, the birth of the monster, but she dedicates pages after pages describing the Swiss Alps, the weather, Lake Geneva, and other such nonsense which has no bearing whatsoever on the story.<br /><br />She leaves a thousand questions unanswered about the monster, his body, his brain, his mind, his thoughts, and goes on writing about irrelevant stuff which makes it a drag to get through a single page of the novel.<br /><br />The author was supposedly eighteen or nineteen when she wrote this book, and it shows on every page. She describes all the characters in her book as beautiful, handsome, charitable, generous, understanding, and generally being great human beings.<br /><br />Not counting the monster, there is only one wicked character in the book, who happens to be a Muslim Turk. His daughter was born off a Christian mother and wanted to be a Christian. The Turk was imprisoned by French authorities and rescued by a Christian man who fell in love with his daughther, but the Turk betrays his rescuer so that his daughter wouldn't end up marrying him, a Christian. Mary Shelley writes:<br /><br />\\"The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who...instructed her daughter in the tenets of her (Christian) religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.\\"<br /><br />Shelley is not only a terrible author, she is also an ignorant and prejudiced one. Her novel, hailed as a classic for two centuries, is infantile dross and lacks any imagination or creativity. Mary Shelley was the Stephanie Meyer of her generation, and her novel should be shelved with the chic-lit vampire romances and other such fare read avidly by teenage girls.he child's governess who happens to be sleeping in that very barn.

B004FOA84A|3.0|Runs ok on Droid X but the music volume will not stay off or even low, keeps going back to full volume when you go back into the game,  even tho if you go back to the settings it says the music is down or off.  This bug will keep me from playing it anymore.
B001CZVVWS|3.0|If one is old enough, I am sure he or she would remember the first time the 'stereo' format in audio was introduced. They made it a point to separate the sound to such a degree that you got a silent hole in the middle of the room between the speakers.<br /><br />Similarly, the post production (video direction) people here thought that it is quite worthwhile to demonstrate the clarity of the blu ray format and blank out the opera at times, and distract you into watching the details on the walls, skirts, flags and the polish of the trumpets and so on. It served the purpose of sprinkling water on one's face just when one is about to doze off to a nice dream...<br /><br />As far as the opera goes<br />Alagna is not impressive. He has to FORCE himself to sing loud and his voice becomes ear piercing and harsh rather than have a beautiful rounded tone when just about any other great singer of this opera, from Domingo upwards who tried the same. It becomes quite irritating and the vibratos kind of make the intonation either sharp or flat. He is just inadequate for this role.<br /><br />Urmana was just about adequate. Although she does not really become the star of the show, she has done far more justice to Aida than Alagna has to Radamez. Komlozi (Amneris) has sung her role quite well. The rest of the cast are quite alright, and do their parts quite well.<br /><br />Kudos to Riccardo Chaily. He really impresses along with the orchestra. The sound is just great, and the audio balancing and post production has been done rather impressively. He and the orchestra/chorus is the reason that I have given 3 stars for this production rather than 2.<br /><br />Zafirelli? I think he is getting a little old and his sense of what is grandiose is getting a little grander and therefore, rather gaudy. Remember what they did with the eastman color or technicolour in the movie 'South Pacific'? He kind of achieves this with this production.<br /><br />Would I have bought it if I had seen it before doing so? In all likelihood, NO.<br /><br />HOWEVER,one gets used to a bad smell too provided most of the other stuff is more or less OK. So what is immediately distracting pales a bit, and the overall beauty of the production with Chailly in command redeems it to an extent.WEVER,one gets used to a bad smell too provided most of the other stuff is more or less OK.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|I had the free app, love the paid app. Being able to pause and record radio just adds to the awesomeness of all the local and web stations that are available. Plus the alarm function gives you the best clock radio you can buy!
B004FOA84A|3.0|fun,  like the old zork or phastasmagoria Sierra game but a little short and a little too easy. I did enjoy it while it lasted.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|So glad i had never read this books until i saw previews of HBO's a game of thrones. I could not put the first book down and would have had a hard time waiting for the next book so glad i came late to them.
1439153663|5.0|Thank you to all who wrote such great reviews, they are the reason I got to enjoy this wonderful book.  It is a five star book for certain.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Honestly, one of the things I was jealous of the iOS devices was getting this app. Now o regret getting the app on my iPod touch. I can always be connected where ever I go! I'm glad to have the ability to record radio, especially with anime and Japanese music. :) Again, thank you so much! I'm glad I can get exclusive free apps this awesome from the Amazon Appstore! Just get this app, its worth it. I would even pay for it ;)
0756404738|5.0|Everyone seems to either love or hate Pat Rothfuss and his two massive novels in the Kingkiller Chronicles.  I understand the love part, I am firmly in that group, but I don't get the hate.  I've seen the leaked videos on youtube of him giving readings, the guy is funny and personable.  I've read his blog.  He IS a marketing genius, but why would anyone hold that against him?  It worked for him, obviously, both books NY Times bestsellers.  And we all know there are a lot of great amazing books that do NOT sell like his do.  Better books?  Maybe.  Heck, even probably.  But I'm not sure how you can take anything away from what he has created here.  Likeable characters, a nice framing for a \\"simple\\" story of how a legend is born.  I am fully invested in Kvothe and I can't wait to see how it all turns out, because there is obviously something bigger happening in that \\"gimmick\\" of framing that Pat is using for these Chronicles.  I fully trust him to pay it off at the end of the next book....even if that is four more years from now.  You can see how he is a perfectionist.  The writing is REALLY good.  I do not understand where people are coming from that say he's not.  There are several passages that I have had to stop and re-read just for the sheer beauty of them.  That rarely ever happens to me.  And this is coming from someone who has read thousands upon thousands of books, and has written close to a million words of fantasy fiction himself.  And I will never be as good a writer as Pat is.  That is the main thing I come away from reading Wise Man's Fear.  I can't imagine anyone not giving his books a try.  If you don't like it, that's fine.  But I will try to get everyone I know to read them, even give them out as gifts, which is also something I never do.  They are that good.
B004FOA84A|1.0|i can not even open the application.  I keep on getting a force close.  I am glad I did not have to buy the game.  I have a motorola droid 2.
0307120007|5.0|Yes, it's a cute book.  But with probably 100 other books on her shelf, my 2 1/2 yr old daughter will always pick this one.  I don't quite get it, what she loves so much about it, but she has it memorized and will read it over and over to me, her daddy, and all her stuffed animals.  She just adores this book, and that is all that matters to me <3
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I want to watch the films I grew up with not the revised ones. They are mostly awful to watch. Every great movie releases the original or a combination of directors cut and original. That's the way it should be.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is fun. But it lacks in the department of needing more story. It is way to short for such a fun game. The puzzles are just enough but it need more. Like chapters that could be add. I hope they do.
B004FOA84A|1.0|It wouldn't even start before it quit on the LG Optimus V. I can't even comment on how gameplay was because i didn't get past a blank screen.
0307405095|5.0|I love it! Great recepies and amazing photos. I will definitely buy Martha Szewart's Cookies and Cupcakes, I believe they are as great as this one. The recepies are well explained, so you don't have to be a proffesional cook to make something from this cookbook. I recommend it!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|this app is awesome. it does have the occasional force close if you try to use SoundHound to tag a song you like.  HTC EVO
075666733X|5.0|The book arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I was amazed at the detailed but clear pictures displayed. It is TRULY the BEST atlas of the human body I have ever seen! I absolutely LOVE it and would definitely recommend it to anyone in the medical field!!!!!!
B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter saw this movie in the theater and I new I would have to preorder. Ever since we saw it, she won't get a hair cut and says she wants to paint her hair golden to be like Rapunzel:)We love this movie, great addition to the princesses
B004FOA84A|5.0|was a great way to kill some time, wish it was longer, hope to see another game soon. although it will hopefully be smaller in size or at least allow for moving to SD
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Have listened to this album everyday since the day after they put it on their site in it's entirety, which, as well as being a cool thing to do, was brilliant if everyone else got as addicted to it as I did before it's release.  Bought it here shortly after midnight on the release date, that should sum up how unique this album is, and how great it rocks!
1433502410|5.0|This book and its internet companion are amazing for in depth biblical discussion and research. Will be reading it for quite sometime.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Sounded like a great idea, even if the game is short.  Unfortunately, out force closed on my Moment even after clearing the cache.  Too bad, I was excited to try it.    Oh well, hopefully the author will keep working on it.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Don't know why it has so many low ratings. It never force closed on my Droid X. It's fun but I finished in less than an hour. I'd love more levels.
B004FOA84A|5.0|So much like the classic Myst game that took PCs by storm in the 90's. I really hope they make a sequel. Only complaint is that, yes, it's awfully short. About 3-5 hour playtime.<br />And for some reason, muting the volume control only controls the title screen volume; in-game volume is unaffected.
B004FOA84A|1.0|objects that i acquire simply vanish from my collection. ive restarted game 3 times and it happens each time. ther is no way that i can find to reget the items either. impossible to play game.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love this app, especially for free, but would happily pay, it's that good! Has every major radio station in greater Cleveland, even hd subchannels and noaa weather, recording and rewind features are very useful, like dvr for radio!
B004FOA84A|5.0|good game.reminds me of lucas arts. does force close but keep opening...it will work.              great game. does fc but keep trying you wont be disappointed.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Glad it was free, 10 minutes?? Thought it was supposed to be reminiscent of Myst... Looked beautiful though. Was having fun until it shot me back to the main menu. Lame.
B004G6009U|5.0|Tangled offers something for eveyone. Bought with our granddaughter in mind, even grandpa was laughing during this exciting movie! This is the freshest \\"princess\\" movie Disney has released since 'The Princess and the Frog'. Tangled is a completely new experience that will keep you guessing and leave you on the edge of your seat!<br />That said: I preordered this movie a month before release from Amazon. I am disabled and cannot guarantee that a trip to the store is possible on release day. A \\"Girl's Night Tangled Party\\" was planned for the movie at the end of release week.<br />By the end of the week, I still had no movie and rather than cancel the party, I sent my daughter to purchase another for me at Target.<br />My movie did not arrive from Amazon for over two weeks. I will never again pre-order a movie from Amazon. I could've understood not getting the movie until a few days after the release, but a few weeks after the release - is unforgivable.<br />Tangled earned five stars. Amazon earned one star.
B004FOA84A|1.0|So I was pretty stoked about playing this game, since it's genre is right up my alley. Unfortunately it keeps force closing on me, so I am unable to play it. Luckily I didn't pay for it, because that would have been a total waste of $0.99
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I am loving this app! UI is simple, functional and stylish. True to broadcast,  without added advertising inserts. Awesome selection of stations, with easy browse and search functions. He stations where available..  incredible sound quality. Samsung Epic 4G
B001GCUO5M|2.0|This is a beautiful looking movie but the plot is subpar. We skipped it in the theaters because we thought we had it figured out just from the commercials. We did and that's no mean feat for my significantly larger. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic but as a whole, this story was weak. Will DiCaprio ever play a normal, untortured soul?
B004CR5TD0|3.0|This is nothing like Bon Iver, and this is definitely not dubstep.  Any reviews that try and convince you that it is will definitely be leading you the wrong way.  Listen to Fabriclive 37, and then just try and compare this to dubstep - you will be hearing apples and crescent wrenches when you compare the two.    This is some ambient IDM with auto tune vocals thrown in.  Very mellow and good to listen to while going to sleep, but definitely not going to keep the party pumped until 5am.      I do enjoy listening to this.  The main reason why I gave it 3 out of five stars though is that James Blake's CMYK EP has been in my steady rotation for months and is definitely better and with a clearer sense of direction.  He almost tries to get TOO creative here, in the same way that Rudi Zygadlo did on \\"Great Western Laymen\\" (which is a much better album than this is.)    James Blake deserves a lot of respect for getting some mainstream publicity for his legitimate electronic music.  I am just saying that if this deserves 5 stars, then his CMYK EP deserves 7 stars and that just isn't realistic.
B0000028RR|5.0|Powerful, but hopefully one day the people in this culture learn freedom is an illusion and we need to replace aversive controls with positive reinforcement.  Hopefully one day people learn to recognize subtle controls as well, and then musicians can really rage against the machine.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The most helpful feature is the digital audio recording and instant playback.  Integrated radio, podcast and streaming is fabulous... This app is worth paying for (got free thru amazon).
B0011UBDTK|2.0|The product arrived quickly.  The price was good and Amazon always does a good job expediting.  The product looks nice, but several of the discs have flaws.  There are several episodes cannot be viewed.
B004FOA84A|2.0|First, the good.  I love this format of game, like the old Myst and 7th Guest games, its an adventure/puzzle game with lovely graphics and a fun soundtrack.  The puzzles are simple, but entertaining, and just hard enough to keep you going.  Now the bad: this was originally an iPhone game, and the translation to android is far from seamless. It force closes immediately about every 3rd time I open it.  The back button on my phone exits the app instead of performing the in-game back action.  The game is completely incapable of resuming from multitasking, so if I check my email, I have to go all the way back through the Splash screen and the main menu to get back to my game.  All in all, there's a lot of stuff technically broken, which is sad because the game is otherwise great.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I like the bit of the game I've gotten to play so far, but it force closes most of the time, which is getting really annoying. Samsung Transform 2.2.
B004FOA84A|1.0|couldnt play, as soon as it opened it would go black then say &quot;application is not responding&quot; and my only option was to force close.  uninstalling. only got it cuz it was free via: free app of the day.  samsung vibrant
B000PMLFRA|1.0|These Blu-Rays are the \\"Special\\" Editions only. Total Crap. Save your money and enjoy the original theatrical releases on regular DVD from the 2-dvd movie sets.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love Tune In.  If it doesn't have all your local stations, they might be under Clear Channel control and you might need IHeartRadio to get those.  This one is the best though.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force close lg optimus v even after reboot. I also agree with those who say it needs an option to move to sd card because it is a huge file. Would love to try it if it would work.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|No need to critique the details of the movie here since it is based on the bio of IP. But what I would like to say in this very short review is its clear story arc. Watching IP the night before (again!  :-)), I never felt lost in the character roles or ever lost in the direction they were going. I was suprised with the dubbing with IP2 at first but got to like it more and more as the movie went along. I thought the quality of the audio was richer and deeper than IP as well. My speakers got some workout in the lower ranges more so than IP so this was nice. Due to this, I was immersed and better captured with how things were progressing. The variety of fights and the personal side of IP was definitely a plus for me and I consider this a very very good sequel. Would I dare to say it was better than the first? Well re-read what I said above and I think you'll have your answer!
B004FOA84A|3.0|It's a good game, well done and works in the xoom. The only bad thing is that it's very short
B004FOA84A|3.0|Got it to start on install only the one time.  Looked fun but does nothing but force close now.  Optimus V.  The extra gfx chip lets me play near anything but guessing the 600mhz proc is to weak for this one.
1433502410|5.0|The ESV study bible is easy to use, the only thing, it is bit thick and heavy to carry along. Otherwise, it is a great bible to have for reading at home.
B002ZG9800|4.0|I honestly think this is Jim Carrey's best work ever! This movie is funny, sad, and extremely fascinating all at the same time. I have to applaud Jim and Ewan McGregor for totally immersing themselves in their respective characters, there's no winking at the camera to let the audience know they're just playing a part. You have to keep reminding yourself that this is really a true story.<br />The plot is difficult to explain, it's in the \\"You Can't Make This Stuff Up\\" category. Carrey plays a petty con man living a duel life as a married, church going man who is having homosexual trysts on the side.....when he finally \\"comes out\\", he does it in a big way and finds that he needs more and more money to live the flamboyant lifestyle he desires, thus causing him to to engage in more con artist/criminal activity to keep that lifestyle going. This lands him in jail where he meets the love of his life, Phillip Morris, played by McGregor. The outrageous lengths he goes to, to remain with Phillip makes up the crux of the story, and it's one wild ride!<br />Though not for everyone, this film deserved better than just being released to a few theaters!
B0000033J9|5.0|I can't tell you how many times that I have watched Doctor Zhivago! I guess it's because of three things, the incredible story, the location where it was filmed, and the beautiful music score! From beginning, to end, you must not have any interruptions or you will lose the whole effect of the movie! Being a musician, the music transports me into that time, and makes me feel like I'm right there with Zhivago! I don't know why, it just does! Maybe it's because the music is so mystical, that it just draws you in. I have had the soundtrack of Doctor Zhivago on LP(vinyl) for many years now, and then I decided that I should definitely upgrade, and get it on CD! So I finally did, and it's bringing back all of those great memories that I had when I first started listening to it, but even better now!!! Thanks for being such a great place to shop, Amazon!!!
B004FOA84A|1.0|This took less than an hour to beat.  very disappointing!  I am glad I didn't purchase this.  I do not recommend this game.  If it had more levels/mysteries I would enjoy it.  I will be   uninstalling.
B004PGO25O|1.0|\\"Resistance\\" is a good word for the often irrational lethargy that holds creativity back, and I was intrigued by what Pressfield would recommend to overcome it. But his treatment is sloppy, undeveloped, unpolished, and even reckless. In fact, what's bad about this book nicely illustrates what's wrong about his thesis. It is a good way to \\"create\\" mediocrity rather than excellence.
0756404738|5.0|Since the last book I was expecting the second one ( and I was not the only one to think that we had to wait too long). Anyway, the expectations were greatly overcome!    The second book IMHO is better thant the first one. It seems two books in one: the first one a typical college-university story book and the second one, a great adventure.     The dialogs are splendid and the autor does not intend to go too fast with the plot, so you can enjoy every bit of it. If I could I would advise the autor to go slowly with the plot. He has the talent to do it and I will be in debt if I have a lot of more books of this saga.    I would recommend anyone to read it.
B004132HZS|5.0|I can't tell you how much I enjoyed watching this modern interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. The acting is excellent. It's dark, humorous and just plain thrilling. This really does deserve all of the great reviews it has received. My only complaint is that the season wasn't longer... I can't wait for season 2!
B003HYSSZK|5.0|I started out very skepticle of Matt Smith and his portrayal of The Doctor. But by the end of the season I was sold! I think for those of us Tennant fans, it may take a while to accept Smith's Doctor. He's quite different. But I think just as brilliant in his own way. The stories of this season are just as good as the previous seasons. Give it a chance!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Just installed on my Zoom and seems to work as described.  I was able to listen to 5 of my favorite local Minneapolis stations + a police scanner channel.   Haven't tried to record yet but so far so good.
B00499LTLM|5.0|This revival of a modern day Sherlock is awesome. Cumberbatch and Freeman are the perfect Sherlock and Watson. All of the episodes are captivating. Exciting and a bit scary...perfect mystery series. Yes, there are only three episodes, but they are the equivalent of two hour shows. Good enough to watch over again. Can't wait for another season!
B004FOA84A|4.0|was very addicting! wish it was longer ..I got stumped a few times but figured it out. can't wait for another one ....hopefully another one soon?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the new levels. Totally different from the original angry birds though. I really don't get the 25 word minimum on this review bc I've already said the app was awesome....
B004FOA84A|1.0|couldn't play. kept force closing not allowing me to even load anything in this game! wish i could have played, but definitely not worth the space or download onto your phone!
B004FOA84A|3.0|When ur get too many items that go into the center...  it hides all the peculiar ones u haven't used yet another user can't get them back
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've tried a few of these apps on android but this one is the most full featured and stable been using the free version for months and has never locked up!
B004X4QW42|4.0|Love IpMan Part 1 but this sequel wasnt as good but still worth the watch. like all hong kong movies, the choreography was phenomenal and compensated for some of the things the movie lacked- for one, the acting- the foreign devils were the worst actors :)
B004XDYJRU|2.0|This app has evolved quite a bit recently and has become the number one radio app on my Android device, I highly recommend it to anyone
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I'm half way through this book, it's an easy read and keeps you interested the whole time.  Looking forward to reading the next volume.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|This is the third book Michael Connelly has offered in the Mickey Haller series.  THE REVERSAL was a good yarn but definitely my least favorite of the three, now understand, not a bad review just not as good as the others.  Mickey and Maggie working together FOR the prosecution with the aide of Harry Bosch.  Good story, rather predictable.  Recommend the entire series and almost anything by Connelly.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I see people saying that they finished this in a half hour but I'm stuck. I don't know what to do with the fishbowl, matches or combination. Nothing works on the scale. What am I doing wrong?
0316056863|4.0|Fey's memoir is a series of essays that are more like pearls on a string than a fully developed narrative.  Many of the stories are laugh-out-loud funny.  I particularly enjoyed her working Mom rants, the behind-the-scenes story about playing Sarah Palin on SNL, and the instant classic, \\"The Mother's Prayer for Its Daughter.\\"    Here's an easy way to know whether you'll like this book.  Listen to Fey's \\"Fresh Air\\" interview from April 13th, which is available online. If you enjoy that interview and want more, you should read the book.  The bonus is that once you hear Fey telling the stories in her own voice in the interview, you'll be better able to \\"hear\\" her authorial voice when reading the book.    As a GenXer I've always been on the lookout for smart women of my generation who have found a spotlight--Fey is a funny, fantastic representative. Nerds rule!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great free app of the day. Game is great to pass the time and work great on the droid x. Would recommend fee download. Enjoy....
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app. I get to listen to my favorite stations around the country (and around the world) and I get to easily stream my podcasts too. Listening on 4G and don't have any issues with streaming lag.
B004BLTNL6|4.0|The original Meir Zarchi thriller. This film is a classic.  It spotlights a  dark side of society. It is a modern horror story with a very  gratifying ending. A lesson to all women abusers.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Much of the rationale given by the Bush Administration for America going to war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein at the end of the winter of 2003 centered around claims made by British intelligence officials that Hussein's regime sought out mass quantities of yellowcake uranium from the country of Niger in western Africa.  Those claims had been put into the State of the Union speech that Bush had given in January of that year.  As it turned out, though, those claims, when thoroughly investigated, turned out to be untrue.  Subsequently, a high-level couple, ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife, CIA operative Valerie Plame, were outed by cronies inside the Bush White House and placed in the middle of a firestorm in which anyone attempting to discredit the Bush Administration in any small way was censured in the press.  It is their fight that was depicted in the 2010 film FAIR GAME.    Watts and Penn portray the real-life couple at the center of this firestorm.  Penn, as ambassador Wilson, investigates the claims about yellowcake uranium and aluminum tubing supposedly being used to make nuclear weapons being exported between Niger and Iraq back in the late 1990s, as it appears that America is on the brink of ousting Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.  Meanwhile, Watts, as Valerie Plame, makes it her business to get reliable sources of Iraq's intelligence out of there to give the CIA the proper information.  Penn asserts that such a trade of uranium not only could not have occurred, but that the aluminum tubing in question is not of the kind that would be suitable for doing what the Bush Administration says Hussein intends it for--to create a nuclear bomb.  Thus, the rationale for going to war in Iraq has just been rendered fraudulent, but a little too late for those Iraqi civilians and U.S. soldiers caught in the middle.  Even so, however, Watts' name and status are both exposed in the media from within the bowels of the administration, rendering her damaged goods, and infuriating Penn.    The other significant thing the whole imbroglio causes is a huge schism between the couple, since Watts is initially unwilling to fight back while Penn makes the rounds on the networks to tell the truth of the matter.  The allegations against both of them mount in the press, which keeps hounding them for their alleged lack of patriotism; and finally, both of them come out of the shadows to tell their side of the story.  Watts manages to make her decision after having a talk with her father (Shepherd), a veteran of the Vietnam War who, because of his military life, had to move both himself and his family to twenty different locales around the world and America.  And while they didn't come out of the imbroglio completely unscathed in the media, in the end, the Bush Administration and its minions didn't either.    Incisively directed by Doug Liman, who was responsible for the 2002 Robert Ludlum adaptation THE BOURNE IDENTITY, FAIR GAME is a powerful expose of the Iraq war as seen through the eyes and experiences of its most noted diplomatic figures, every bit as powerful a political film as any, documentary or otherwise, made since 9/11, and, indeed, every bit as thorough as films like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THIRTEEN DAYS.  While there are political considerations to be considered in this film, especially give that Penn was one of the most ferocious and outspoken critics anywhere of the Bush Administation from the beginning, this is equally a hard-hitting character study as well; and Penn and Watts do an excellent job of portraying the beleaguered Wilsons, while a whole host of good character actors are superb in their roles of the dark underlings that work for Team Bush.  Liman, who also does the cinematography, shoots FAIR GAME in a very documentary-like style, and in the same bleached-color visuals that were a trademark of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, MINORITY REPORT, and MUNICH.    Both Valerie Plane and Joe Wilson risked everything theyhad to get the truth out there about the Bush Administration's dissembling with regards to a non-existent connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11; and FAIR GAME is an excellent film depicting that struggle, clearly one of the best films of 2010.
B004FOA84A|3.0|A nice game that involved a bit of thinking to sovle the clues but not super complicated. very addictive as well. Only reason not giving it more stars is because it was too short a game.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had viewed a portion of this production on a public broadcasting tv station and the music began haunting my mind until I had to have a full recording of it.  Although this is a \\"stand and sing\\" performance (without scenery and depictions of various locations and events, etc.), the interaction between the characters and use of costume changes and special lighting makes it every bit as compelling and heart-wrenching as if it were a fully acted-out play.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Ive been using tune in constantly for a while now and was unaware of the pro version which records the streams.  This app truly has everything that you would want as far as radio is concerned.  The buffering times arent bad as well.   Tunein Radio has got to be my favorite app.  Perfect for finding the right tunes when working out or jogging.  Droidx.
B004FOA84A|5.0|great game finnish in about 30 min very very fun thanx had me stumped with fish bowl and the paintin and the globe htc evo
B004FOA84A|4.0|I'm glad I got this game for free, since it was really short. Fun game while it lasted and great graphics. Easier than Myst et al (also less frustrating).
0525423273|5.0|I tend not to read much contemporary fiction, either in YA or adult fiction. But there was so much buzz about Anna and the French Kiss and I follow Stephanie Perkins on Twitter, so when I saw it on the shelf at work I decided to give it a whirl.      I've read a few YA romancey books in the last year, but haven't ever been excited enough to talk about them. But Anna and the French Kiss is not your average YA romance. In the absolute best way possible.    Yes, there is romance. And yes there is kissing (after all it IS called Anna and the French KISS) but it's so much more than that.    Her characters are so complex and rich and ALIVE. I seriously feel like if I went to Paris I might run into Anna and Etienne at the movie theatre. <3    Not really spoilery summary:  Anna is sent off to the School of America in Paris against her will. She doesn't speak French and just wanted to finish out her senior year of high school in peace, but her Dad has other ideas and doesn't seem to care what she thinks.  Fortunately she meets Meredith on her first day and then Meredith introduces her to her group of friends and suddenly it doesn't seem like such a lonely place after all. Especially when she meets Etienne St. Clair. Who unfortunately already has a girlfriend. But in some ways that takes the pressure off. They can just be friends and talk and get to know each other without the pressure of wondering where the relationship is going. Until Anna starts to realize that she might want more than friendship. And it seems like he might too. And things get complicated.    As much fun as the romance part of it was, the stuff I loved was the background of the characters and how absolutely real they felt in their reactions and interactions. Sure there are the typical misunderstandings and such, but they don't feel cliched or overdone. I really feel like I got to know these people.    It's not often that I cry over this kind of book, but I found myself tearing up several times (yes, I am abig crybaby) and I laughed quite a bit too.    In short - if you like a good story with romance, humor and rich characters, you should love this book.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|It's a nice app especially for free, everything works fine and its cool to find other stations you like. But this app has one glaring problem....just about all of my local stations block streaming of their broadcast completely.  this was in the free version also.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game, at first seems interesting but quickly you realize that its too short and has no replay value. once you solve the game there is nothing else to do, so max 20 minutes of playing. don't waste your money. spend that dollar somewhere else. got it for free and even that sounds like too much for this game, waste of space on my phone. if any new levels are created they're probably going to charge for them. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL REGRET IT. sounds more fun than it really is.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I bought this box set purely out of my love for Dylan's music and it's a collectors item, to me. I never expected for the difference of the music in mono to be so drastic! Especially with Blonde on Blonde and Highway 61 Revisited, the instrumentals sound so different. I heard things that I hadn't previously in the stereo versions. His voice sounds more charismatic. The instrumentals have a more harsh sound that really adds to the message of Dylan's music. These 8 albums are some of his best work and they are all great albums for someone starting to listen to Dylan or even us veteran listeners. This was a great purchase, and worth every penny. No regrets here!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Alas i can't run this it crashes every time.   best of luck from a fellow developer   is guess it need more words before it will let me post
B0044DEAUA|5.0|the battery is not so strong as they say. after all its the best speaker i found, with a great quality of phone conversation. I defiantly recommend on this product.
B004FOA84A|2.0|if you want to spend a dollar killing 30 minutes to an hour, go for it. it looks good, its kinda fun, but it is ridiculously short. get for free while you can, otherwise its not worth it
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have read negative reviews on Nick Jonas' performance. I was expecting his performance would be horrible. I agree that he is not at par with the other cast members, but he wasn't THAT bad, not bad at all. The role suit his voice and his personality. He is still young, if he wants to be involved in the theater esp. in Broadway, it's not too late for him to be trained not as a pop artist. There is still room for improvement. Overall the 25th Anniversary Concert was amazing. Every cast member is dedicated to their craft. Bravo! I got goosebumps all throughout (teary-eyed too). The DVD purchase was worth it.
B000000OAC|5.0|I was only seven when this album came out.  The artwork really freaked me out.  Especially the picture of the robot grabbing the audiece members with an insane look on its face.  Awesome.<br /><br />Every song, with possibly the exception of \\"Who Needs You\\", is a classic.  Not much more can be said about \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We are the Champions\\", but look what else is here:<br /><br />\\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" is about a heavy as Queen ever got.<br />\\"All Dead All Dead\\" is a beautiful Brian May ballad.<br />\\"Spread Your Wings\\" is a great power ballad, written by John Deacon.<br />\\"Fight From the Inside\\" is a funk rock classic sung by Roger Taylor.<br />\\"Get Down Make Love\\" is an awesome psychedelic rock masterpiece from Freddy.<br />\\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\" is a great blues tune from Brian May.<br />\\"It's Late\\", a Brian May rock masterpiece.<br />And finally, \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" from Freddy, another one of his great piano ballads.<br /><br />This album, and Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" are about as classic late 70's rock as you're going to find.  Buy it!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Would love to see more apps like this. Reminds me of everything from old NES games to Myst. Love love love.   Give me more please. :)
193604126X|5.0|From Penguin Books 1985 Edition<br /><br />This is my first Wodehouse novel about Bertie and Jeeves and I must say I'm been duly impressed! Much of the humor I've read has been full of puns and light on situational humor. This Jeeves novel ignores obvious puns and highlights the dubious advice of Bertie and the outcome of ignorance. This cascade of serendipitous blunders is a surefire way to the destination of giggle-dom. You'll have your head shaking at the ignorance-fraught advice, the sure-to-come calamity and the continual advice is just as silly as the last.<br /><br />I laughed in restaurants, on the bus, in the airport, on the plane, at home and standing in line. There is swath of good humor to be found among the pages of Right Ho, Jeeves. Every page you read you can either witness comic calamity, the foreshadowing of failure or witty English dialogue.
B000FC2FVA|5.0|This product was exactly as advertised. i recommend wholly. A++++. It is all good for me. (more words to appease Amazon.com, though nothing more to say).
B0043ISH6O|3.0|I really enjoyed the film, \\"The Social Network\\"; and within the film, this soundtrack works really well.  What it doesn't work really well for, however, is background or \\"just listening\\" music.  \\"Hand Covers Bruise\\" (the tune that is playing under the end of the first scene in the movie, and the couple of other times when Mark Zuckerberg appears to be flummoxed)is terrific; my eyes still tear up when I hear the trio of chords that enter after a few minutes of industrial hum in both the tune and the reprise on the disc.  But the rest...once again, perfect when listened to in the film, but HCB is the only melody I would consider beautiful.
B00005AQAW|5.0|This product was exactly as advertised. i recommend wholly. A++++. It is all good for me. (more words to appease Amazon.com, though nothing more to say).
B002C6A6FY|5.0|Few people will buy his disc set who have not already seen the movie.  There are a lot of \\"things you didn't know\\" as supplementary material, but the movie stands on its own.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|felt so exciting when i see the encore. you will do so if you watched and love the 10th anniversary edition.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Has replaced my sirrius xm app. Excellent UI and very reliable connection/stream. Nice selection of stations organized by location and by genre. Finally get to listen to Neal Bortz again.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Would not even open. . . Force close 3 times, turned off &amp; on phone, force close twice more. What a waste of time foe the d/l.  LG Optimus S
B004XDYJRU|5.0|An excellent app. I've removed all other radio apps in favor of this one. Radio, Police/EMS & NOAA all in one place. Doesn't get any better.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is awesome.  I am a natural athlete, zumba instructor, marathoner and have done a million workout videos.  I have always struggled to keep the lbs. off and I absolutely love this video.  It is really tough but it's short so it makes it easier to stick with it.  It is also great for travel b/c all you need are hand weights which are easily improvised with some canned food or coke bottles (I travel a lot and don't get to work out when I travel.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this as an addition to your workout program.  I have been doing it for about 3 weeks about 5 times a week and I can definitely see results (4 lbs down.)  You have to watch you diet though too!
B004FOA84A|1.0|I was really looking forward to trying this game out,  and would have even paid for it. Now I'm glad I didn't bc it only worked for about 5min before it started to continually force close on my DROID X. I loved the graphics,  and the 5min of the game I actually got to play. Fix it and I will definitely try it again.
B00417HV14|5.0|... and one heck of a singer too.  Seeing him in concert is quite an experience, so having one I can watch at home is very nice.  In terms of the Blu-Ray transfer, I thought it was a bit \\"muddy\\" and maybe not a lot better than standard DVD, but still worth every penny.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I was skeptical at first,  but I ended up LOVING this app. It has all of my favorite stations,  and I really love the record feature bc I can record parts of my favorite morning show that I don't want to miss. A must have app for any radio lover!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Installed on Xoom, but immediate Force Close on trying to run. Based on the number of reviews mentioning FCs on different devices it sounds like this one needs to go bad to the drawing board.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have been using the free version until now.  I was super excited to see this offered today by Amazon.  There is the recording feature which is available for this version but other than that I believe everything is the same.  I still really enjoy this app and I enjoy being able to listen to the radio from all over the world with this app.
B004FOA84A|1.0|App will not open. pictures on Amazon look cool. Too bad I can't  play. Please update this app soon. Viewsonic Gtab. calkulin + clemsyn 1.5
0981951244|5.0|For most of my life I have been the hare.  I get out of the gate quick and have great success but can't seem to sustain that intensity at all times.  I always thought this was the way I was supposed to live my life but Darren's book The Compound Effect has shown me not only how the Hare mentality is wrong but how I can become a tortoise by changing a few simple things in my life.    I highly recommend this book if you are looking to change some of the things in your life personally and professionally that you think are holding you back. Darren Hardy gives a great plan to make radical change in your life by changing only a few variables which ultimately lead to exponential changes over time. This is not a quick fix to any problems or challenges you are experiencing but if you put the time in and follow Darren's advice I promise you will see positive fruit in your life. I have already started to implement some of his ideas and I am already seeing some improved success.
B004FOA84A|4.0|this is a great game with challenging secrets. the little story is good to but would be much better if it had more levels. beat it rather quickly as I love mystery games. Droid incredible.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Im so happy this app was free. Now that I've played it I can say that I would have paid for this app - its exciting and fun!
B004FOA84A|3.0|fun game.  ran fine on my tmobile g2.  if anything i wish it had a longer story.  the graphics are pretty good too.  I hope there is a longer sequel for the same price.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I had fun but it was over too quickly. The puzzels were enjoyable and fair, would reccommend to any beginner.  Visually engaging. The backround music is  mundane.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Put together really well would buy it again anytime. Was allot of fun wish it was longer though other than that  though ide give it an a++++++
B004FOA84A|5.0|the first few times i opened it, i had to force close. but then it worked and its a lot of fun if u like to solve resident evil like puzzles. it isnt nearly as long as resident evil so i hope they add more onto this story. not the greatest ending without a sequel or update.
B004FOA84A|1.0|don't pay for this. 10-20/$,1 it's basically just 1% of myst... if u't don't know what that is it might be fun and novel for u young'ns
1416955070|3.0|Decently written YA novel.  It seems to be better thought out and fleshed out than the run of the mill supernatural or vampire novel, and nothing glittery!<br /><br />Most of the main characters have enough substance to them for you to care what happens, and the story is very engaging.<br /><br />Overall a fun read.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|My 11-year-old daughter growing-up-too-fast just watched this for the 3rd time, and I couldn't be happier.  Emma Stone's Olive is, I agree, a thoroughly enjoyable character.  I'd not only like to know Olive, but wish that there just could BE an Olive Pendergast, in our age (and at that age) of chronic conformity.  She is both every girl and uniquely courageous.     Actually, I guess there could be an Olive, if only Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were really like their roles, married and had a daughter.  It's true, as Stone & Gluck say in the commentary, Olive is totally explained by their quirky humor and brand of candor.    This is a smart script, well-directed, filmed & acted.  I am really happy I bought the dvd - and I can't remember the last time I could even bring myself to buy one.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie is certainly one of the best documentaries I have seen in years. Food Inc makes me wonder what the United States is REALLY doing about food and everything else; it is really a shame that more people have not watched this movie. America was founded by people who were well-informed about the day's issues. Can we now say the same?
0316056863|5.0|Home sick in bed feeling gobs of self-pity, I bought Bossypants on my kindle.  Norman Cousins talks about laughter as great medicine.  Tina Fey provided literary antibiotic treatment as I laughed and coughed and slept for two days.  Today I can breathe deeply.  She provides humor from ivy-league lofty to low-down dirty.  I got the sense that she cares about her readers, particularly the women who might wish to enter the entertainment field.  She shares good advice on topics as diverse as leadership and how to act at a photo shoot.  Get it now.  It might just add a couple of years to your life.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Droid X, no issues whatsoever. Very fun and addictive. It's not quite HOG, more so puzzle adventure. Definitely a good pick up. Not done yet so no comment on length.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I can listen to it over and over again, in fact I have many times.  I will say I was skeptic at first, not buying the hype.  I listened to the sample music on Amazon and decided it wasn't for me.  A gentleman at work bought the album at Best Buy the day after I listened to it.  He asked if I had it and if I liked the band.  I told him I didn't think so, but I'd give the full album a chance.    He let me borrow his CD for the afternoon.  I hit play and repeat, as I often do at work since I'm up and down moving around the office all the time, that way something is always playing.  I bet the album played 4 times in a row and each time I started to appreciate it more and more.    Needless to say, I bought my own copy and have enjoyed it ever since.  It's a staple, one of the better albums I can remember in a long, long time.  I'm still shocked how it couldn't have won the Grammy.  I guess I'll have to give Arcade Fire a shot too.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Had fun completing it.. Worked great on my droid x.  Had to take a break to gain new perspectiive and finish it.  Def want more,games like this
1439102724|5.0|On a 1-5 star system I wish I could give a 12!  Great price. With cd! Perfect condition. Super fast ship,  Looks great on my bookshelf. Thank you so much!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Excellent selection of stations from around the world.  Love the live playback and recording.  I wish the app would allow scheduled recordings as some of the stations in listen to are in an 8 hr different time zone.
B004LUHQ1G|3.0|Let me say upfront that I like the Foo Fighters. But I'm just having a hard time warming up to this release. Part of the problem lies with the pre-release hype. It's not the in-your-face, turn-it-up-to-11 extravaganza Dave Grohl promised. At the same time, it lacks all the little touches that made previous Foo Fighters' releases stand out.  I'm not a recording engineer or expert, but everything just seems kind of murky. The big guitar licks, the big choruses are all buried in sort of an undistinguished mass of sound. Listening to this release reminds me of going to a concert where the sound quality isn't quite up to snuff.  Is it a BAD release? Well, no. The band is too good to make a truly horrible record. I just find it kind of boring.  This comment might lose me some credibility, but I liked the poppier, listener-friendly Foo Fighters. Sure, heavy as hell music has its place, but Grohl is such a consummate tunesmith that this seems slight in comparison to earlier work.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Really fun game, but it was so short that I beat it after only a couple of hours!  Games should provide at least a few days worth of play!
159420229X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. At first glance, I can see how most readers would pass this by in a bookstore thinking it was just a bunch of BS with a cool cover. However, it isn't. It's journalistic, scientific, a self-help/improvement book, a memoir of sorts, and humorous. The only reason I gave it four stars out of five is because I was hoping to get a little bit more of the memory tips. However, I do understand that Foer was writing about the people who helped develop these memory techniques, he didn't come up with them himself, and if he were to write about them, he's probably be vioating a lot of copyrights, as those techniques can be found in other books. Overally, this is a really interesting, entertaining read.
1416972242|5.0|Check out the review to this book and many others here! --> theblogettes810.blogspot.com    Clary is a brand new Shadowhunter, but that's all against her wishes. Her mother is finding her place in this magic-induced coma as Clary and her newfound brother, Jace, battle Valentine, the man who is a little too related to the lovebirds / siblings (that sounds bad! They fell in love before their hearts we shattered with the fact that they're related). As Jace battles with himself about being the son of such a hypocritical man, he also battles the fact that the girl he is in love with is also his sister. Poor Jace and Clary, right?! They're perfect for each other.    All in all CoA is absolutely brilliant in every way. It's fo' sho' a page turner, no doubt. And, I'm sure Pennywether would agree, you need to read this book.    (This is an excerpt of the full blog.) Check it out! =]
1400032717|5.0|This book is not boring.  It's not terribly exciting, but reading a book told from the eyes of someone with a completely different view of the world is probably my favorite kind of book.    From the back cover: \\"Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.    \\"This improbable story of Christopher's quest to investigate the suspicious death of a neighborhood dog makes for one of the most captivating, unusual, and widely heralded novels in recent years.\\"    Judging by that description, the main character sounds like an odd duck. But the book is written from 15-year-old Christopher's perspective, and the way he describes his own eccentricities makes them sound almost sensible.  Dogs are easier to understand than people; they make noises and a few different motions to communicate how they feel.  You don't have to try to interpret their facial expressions, and they're not going to lie to you.  Reading Christopher's reactions to people and how he absolutely hates to be touched, not even allowing his parents to hug him without screaming, you both pity his parents and feel Christopher's shocking discomfort to physical contact.  And though neither of his parents is perfect by a long shot, you end up sympathizing with them, even if Christopher can't.      My husband works with kids with special needs, and he read and recommended this book to me a while ago.  I really enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to understand autism a little better.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I don't know what else to say but this is probably the most amazing movie I have ever seen haha! Its is complete in every since of the word because the first one that came out in 2005 I enjoyed thoroughly and I understood it but there were a few minor things that I was confused about and this clear up everything, to who Denzel was to a couple of spoilers lol (you will have to find out). But one thing if you haven't played Final Fantasy 7 (which I Highly advise because it is a masterpiece, even though its outdated now, I still play it and enjoy every second)YOU WILL still enjoy this movie because its awesome but you will not understand the story completely or some of the characters. If you have not even heard about the game at all you will still enjoy this movie you will just go What the heck is going on this is awesome haha. If you have played or beat Final Fantasy 7 then why haven't you bought this yet haha seriously! On another note the service was great the disk and everything else was in perfect condition and it came the first day it said it was good service, everything ya 5 stars! The movie 10 stars :D
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss was simply divine. An absolutely good read that I could not put down. I think what I loved most about this book was that everything was at the right pace, right words, right timing. Nothing was thrown at you and you weren't spinned out of control with info.<br /><br />Anna is devastated. She is being sent around the world to a bordering school where she is alone. No one to help her. She is ALONE! All she sees is a year of exil. What she doesn't see is the cute boy who will soon walk into her future.<br /><br />I liked St. Claire. I loved his accent, the way he talks, his perspective of things. He guided Anna when she need him and they had fun together. What I didn't like was that he was selfish. Sorry, but I had to say it. I know he didn't mean to but he used her as his crutch when he felt lonely and that upset me. While I was glad that he like and fell in love with her genuinely, I was still saddened by his actions.<br /><br />Anna reminded me of me when I was in school. Scared to go to new places, try new things, and  suffered in silence. Anna was so brave and took everything in stride. The character was likable and could relate to well. I like that she was strong. Even in a new and scary place, she held up her head high and made do with what she had. She is an easy person to make friends with and funny at times. Her sarcastic side is something I loved reading.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is a great book. I think I may have even learned a french word or two. The love between St. Claire and Anna is sweet. It is a kind of loves that grows in time within the book and you just fall in love with them. I rooted for them all the way. I was extremely happy that they made it. If you have not, read this book. Read it!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Short and sweet review commence: Amazing addition to the old series, great quality perfect buy for any fan, worth it for the blu-ray! Other than that it was great service came first day and prefect condition 5 stars!
0385737955|5.0|Let me tell that this book was just great! It had me confused for a bit. Just like the characters in the book, you are confused and can't figure much out. I loved it when an author makes me feel like the characters not only seeing everything through their eyes but feeling all the emotions.<br /><br />Thomas has awoken to a nightmare. He doesn't remember anything but his name. The others around him are the same. The live in a maze which no one can escape. But there is something different about Thomas. He is a newbie and should be acting like one. Instead he is smart, fast, and knows what to do. Thomas also wants to be a maze runner.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is like no other book. The plot of it, the action, drama, suspense is all great. The society that is created by these young boys is fascinating. They have rules, regulations, chores and places all must be. They have all lived by it and know nothing else. Thomas is a great character. Even though he may seem scared when something happen his instincts take over and BAM! It's like he's rambo or something.<br /><br />The build up to the main secret was good. Very good. I loved how the reader got to learn secrets and memories little by little inching you close to the big explosion. The book became a page turner and nothing could stop me. The ending was HOLY CROW! I just could not wrap my head around it. It was mind blowing.<br /><br />If you have not read this book. It is a great dyspotian novel that will leave you breathless. Plus it is in a boys POV and that makes for a better read.
B003KTMW9K|4.0|I bought the Director's Cut Enhanced Edition Platinum. I thought I had trouble with the install but the patch installed just fine. This game has the potential to be the best in it's genre. If you are a fan of RPG, like great graphics (beautiful graphics) then you have to get this one. Five stars for the game. It's nice to have a good European RPG, and even nicer to see the great effort they put into the storyline, UI, interactivity, etc.    I will be pre-ordering the future next edition.
B0028ER4PK|5.0|The vinyl is as quiet as a church mouse.  The music is fantastic, some of my favorite songs of all time are on here.  One of the best of all time for a reason.  Nice mix of funky blues and relaxing ambient sounds.  Funny side note, my 24 month old son pointed at Jim on the cover and said \\"Lion King\\".  I cracked up.
B00001ODGR|2.0|I'm a big Styx fan and was hoping to find a good quality recording of their stuff in 5.1 (DTS or DD, I don't care). I am very disappointed with the 5.1 audio of this DVD, both the mix and the audio quality. I honestly thought something was wrong with my home theater until I stuck in one of my Eagles DVDs - the theater's fine; this DVD's audio is just not what I had hoped for.
B003G7164S|5.0|This isn't just a rock album, it is a rock symphony.  No one makes music like this anymore.  I think the original pressing may sound a tad more dynamic, but it has so many quiet passages its hard to find one clean enough.  Doesn't disappoint at all.
1604680547|5.0|This book has an incredible amount of quilting designs that are so versatile.  I will be using the designs in this book alot. Thank you.
0439023521|5.0|I don't like to read, but i wanted to give it a shot and saw that this book was very high rated on amazon and barnes and nobile so i bought it and let me just say wow.   I can barely put it down.   READ read read.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Use every ounce of your brain power to try<br /> and figure this game out. Lots of fun. Dare to play in the dark. Good luck.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|A rental ...not very good.  No chemistry between the two lead actors.  Maybe I was not in the mood but I really could not get into it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I'm giving this one star until this is fixed. I had to delete the app off of my phone because it was taking up too much space.
B004EPYZZ8|1.0|This is the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen and it seems as if the previous 11 reviews were written by people involved in the making of it. I've been to Hawaii 3 times and this is not the Hawaii I remember. There are actual Hawaiians living there, not transplanted Venice Beach surfer types. In fact, 95% of Hawaiians are of Samoan, Chinese, Japanese or Filipino descent. They're not haoles with blonde/blue/zero ounces of body fat! Simply ridiculous.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I was amazed at the sound quality coming out of my little EVO.  Even local stations do not come in this well on any regular radio I own.  It was great fun listening to stations in other cities, too.  Thank you for a great app.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Awesome and addicting game that sucked me in from the get go. The only problem I encountered was with my pop-up notifications causing the game to FC. Will definitely recommend! Samsung Fascinate
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I can finally hear SF Giants games at work in Oregon, this app is amazing. All my favorite CA stations that I miss so much are back in the palm in my hand after all these years. Can't recommend this enough!
B004UID2LC|2.0|Just as the title says. I also don't really recommend it unless you have no choice or any other app/ apk that does the same or better.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is the straight dope. listen to music around the world. easily access programs on demand. record what you want. sure it doesnt have every channel but its pretty damn close. well organized too. im gonna go see what they listen to in cameroon.
B004FOA84A|4.0|fc if phone goes to sleep. would love to see more from author either games or more chapters for this one. thanks for a fun game.
0307454541|2.0|the first 180 pages are confusing too many different characters, too may similar swedish name to keep track of, the story gets more interesting mid way once you figure out what the whole plot is  and forget about the earlier evens, which to me give too much detail when in fact it make no different to the later plot. Once you find out who did it, so to speak, it just keeps going on and on, the author could have saved it for another book, I eventually gave up and closed the book.
0439023513|4.0|WTF HAPPENED TO GALE AFTER ALL OF THOSE YEARS? did katniss ever see him again? does katniss ever think about him? what about the government after over 20 yrs? whos the president after 20 years?  how about her mom?!!!!!! zomg. the book was basically like catching fire without the hunger games at the end. it sucks how this series has to end, and im disappointed in all of the unanswered questions. T_T
B004FOA84A|1.0|force closes every time. I am using the sprint LG Optimus my phone is completely up to date and have had no issues. I have restarted the phone.. re open the app and it still force closes.
B004FOA84A|3.0|this app was very fun before all the force closes. please fix. running on the evo shift 4g. im not sure if the problem is the app or the amazon app store
B004FOA84A|4.0|i finished this game in 30min or so. it was alot of fun but wish there were more to it. they should make a next level or something. but since i'm done with this game, i'm uninstalling.
B00009RGBS|5.0|All the actors do their own singing and dancing in this movie. It turns out great. Richard Gere does an excellent job at his first time tap dance and handling his role in this movie. I personally loved the whole movie and the people chosen to play the parts. An excellent movie, fun to watch.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I liked the free one, but this one certianly has a few features that just fill the program out if you will.  Very nice, I may start using Pandora less :-)
B004FOA84A|5.0|Completed in one afternoon but lots of fun for short little puzzle game. Had some issues force closing when I tried to open it from app menu (Droid X) but when I opened it from Amazon's App Store app there were no problems. That was fun, bring some more!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great interface and display on Xoom and it works as advertised. This is going to be great on the road.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|So far, have to say I'm impressed with the quality and usability of this app. Haven't listened to too much yet, but happy with what I have heard so far (quality). Interface is pretty smooth too.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The free version has been my favorite android app and this is even better. im away from home and cam still listen to my favorite stations. the sleep timer and alarms put it over the top and now the recording makes it perfect. Occasional lag at times.
1594202842|4.0|I liked the Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother although I did not really expect to like it.  I was curious about it because someone from back home asked me about it, so I bought and read it.  Amy Chua is a witty, insightful, and, yes, obsessed writer.  I have lived in South Korea for more than a decade and I have seen many of the Korean versions of the so-called Tiger Mom.  If you expect Asia and Asians to be like the US and Americans, you will be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you have ever spent some time in Asia, you probably have had first-hand experience of Tiger Mom parenting.  The Korean educationsl system, like what Ms. Chua described, is a no-holds barred, unapologetic, extremely rigorous and stressful talent search, where there are winners and losers.  What one reviewer termed child abuse is viewed in Asia as tough love.  This book is an interesting view of another form of parenting, which is not complimentary of the US.  If there is one lasting message from this book, it could be that the educational divide, including the mastery of English as a Foreign language for communication and commerce, is rapidly narrowing between the US and the rest of the world, parts of which some derisively term the third world.  Americans of all ages, ethnicities and parenting beliefs are competing with the children of the various Tiger Moms around the world and we are losing ground in this educational clash of civilizations.  I do think one could fault Ms. Chua for being sterotypical at times and even over-simplifying the Clash of Civilizations premise, but this book was a good albeit at times even a bit disturbing read.
B000OY8NII|3.0|So in a town of apparently hundreds of geniuses, scientific geniuses, the townsperson who happens to, by his every act and word, have the LOWEST IQ, is the one who usually comes up with the answer to the bizarre, unknown and unbelievable.....but, wait, if he is smart enough to outsmart all the - according to the show - greatest minds on earth.....\\" how come he always volunteers to do the grunt work, with reckless abandon and no thought of what the town will do for a sherriff....hmmmm, something sure is weird about this most popular show
B002ZG976U|5.0|Standard story about a girl from a seedy area of the country with a great singing voice who moves to the big city and through hard work and persistance is able to display her ability to her boss who is about to lose her show business establishment, who takes the singer under her wing and together they are able to find success/eventual happiness for the singer and also save the boss's business.  Very enjoyable musical numbers and very good acting on the part of Cher, Cam Gigandet and Stanley Tucci. Christine Aguilera is fairly good, though could use a couple more lessons to keep from overdoing it. In general....well worth the purchase and is one of those that can be watched again and again.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This puzzle game was really fun. Challenging, but never got frustrated and stuck on just one hard part. It took about 30 minutes. I felt like it was too short but then again it felt good to get to the end.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a fun game. It holds your attention and makes you want to do the next level. No dead ends. I hope they do more!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Game forces a close everytime the screen times out. Soooo annoying... Has potential but the every 10 sec force closing needs to be fixed.. Samsung epic
B004FOA84A|5.0|i thought the graphics were great and the puzzle was classic. it was challenging enough (but not frustrating). i agree that it was just too short! more please!
B004FOA84A|1.0|every time i open this app it opens a message which makes me force close this app, dont get unless they fix this glitch.- Droid 2
0452289963|5.0|I have many of Edkhart Tolle's books and CD's and this is the one I am currently reading while waiting in the Doctor's offices.  No matter what page I turn to I find just the right inspirational words I need for that moment in my life.  This is truly wonderful \\"self help\\" literature and great for everyone, I just gave it to one of my children as a birthday gift and I highly recomment it to everyone who has a desire to improve their daily life.  There is both food for thought and food for life in Tolle's material.  W. Joan Cousins, Bay Area CA
B00005QENZ|4.0|This CD has all of the good songs and hits you can sing along too! Love this and great buy!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|can finally get the sports hub no matter were I am. Best live radio app available. great on EVO . Don't bother with another app
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I normally wouldn't buy radio apps so when this came up free I jumped on it. I have to say I love this app. I'm not sure about the free version but the pro version is great!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really fun old school mystery game where you find clues and use them on other items later in the game. Works great on Evo.  I just wish it were longer finished it in about an hour.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|i really love zombie movies and to have this series,which is very well done,is a bonus 4 me.as there are only 6 episodes i think it was a bit short,but its got a good cast and script,roll on the second season hopefully it will just get better and better.i recommend this series to any zombie fan,its got frights,laffs,and even some good action scenes.<br />roll on season 2.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a great game! Really good graphics and the sound and music help create an intriguing mood. the puzzles are challenging but not impossible. Works perfect on my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
0520215850|5.0|It's not that often that I find English translations of Chinese classics that I truly like. Even a very good translation can make you cringe at times because a phrase that's just strange, probably because it's not very translatable. Time to time there are precious gems that really struck me, like Cyril Brich's Peony Pavilion, which I thought truly preserved all the beauty and wit of the original, without being too literal. Moss Roberts's Three Kingdoms is another, but this time maybe not for being a reflection of the original, but for helping me look at the novel with a fresh eye altogether.     First thing first, I am not a big fan of Luo Guanzhong's venerable novel. I admit, it's a good novel from a story telling perspective. There are an insane amount of historical material and legends out there, and it's almost impossible to string together a full story of the Three Kingdoms period, but Luo Guanzhong achieves it. There are many other semi-historical \\"romances\\" out there in China, but with the possible exception of Romance of Sui-Tang (which actually covers a shorter period of time and waaayyyy less material), nothing can equal Luo Guanzhong's work in terms of turning thousands of names into one coherent, captivating story.    Now, my complaints, other than the normal harp about characters being nothing like who they are in history books, lie with the style. Luo's ROTK is probably the first in China's vernacular fiction literature, therefore it is actually a lot less vernacular than all others in the same genre. At the same time, Luo's language is not exactly standard official classical Chinese either. It's this weird combination of classical and vernacular. When compared to Red Chamber, or even Water Margin, Luo's ROTK prose appears extremely terse, dry, borderline boring. When compared back to great works of history such as Shi Ji or Sanguo Zhi or even Tang fictions, Luo's prose lacks that kind of precise elegance and punch of real classical Chinese.     That is why the English translation was actually more enjoyable to read for me than the original. First of all, it's an easire and more fluid read. The style reminded me of Ivanhoe and I thought that was simply brilliant. There is no better style to carry an exotic saga of lords and retainers and battles and strategies. The translator also did not try overmuch to emphasize the oriental exoticism of the story. His translation is very matter-of-fact, and you don't notice the foreignness (probably until a proper name pops up lol), you just notice the fascinating people and events unfolding. Also, an English translation just allows me to look at it with a fresh eye. It lifts the story into a more fictional realm for me, and it's actually more enjoyable that way being more distinctively separated from real history.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app seems to be missing the only two local radio stations I really care about. I have another radio app to cover those two stations, but I was hoping this would fill that need. Other than that, app is pretty good.
B004FOA84A|2.0|My husband loved it and had no problems on his droid 2, my lg ally kept force closing it. When I finally got it to work I was frustrated time and again by the puzzles. Maybe I'm not a  puzzle game person but I'm just glad I didn't waste any actual money on that 2 hours of frustration. I will be cheering as I uninstall this app.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I'm adding myself to the long list of upset people who are unable to play this game. Stupid force close before the game even starts up. What's the bug? Why haven't the developers acknowledged the many people who paid and can't play?
B002BSHXJA|5.0|It arrived quickly & in excellent condition.  The only weird thing (and this wouldn't be the sellers fault) is that the songs listed on the \\"Past Masters\\" sleeve does not match what is recorded on the CD.  I'm not disappointed though as I enjoy listening to all & any Beatles songs!
B00005S6K6|5.0|This is a movie for all romantics.  It keeps you wanting more.  Can see it many times and still enjoy it.  Robert Deniro is a very interesting character  and Streep plays the part very well.
B003PIUC02|5.0|When I first started watching this series on Starz, I was totally blown away with everything about it...the fighting, the plots, Spartacus, the other characters...and, did I say Spartacus!  Andy Whitfield's portrayal of this slave that rises in the ranks of the gladiators is flawless...he draws you into his story in a way that I've never experienced before.  Everyone is perfectly cast in this story.    I don't buy too many movies or series, as I can see most of them on Netflix...but buying this one was a high priority for me.    It is very sad that Andy Whitfield had to quit the show because of his cancer.  I pray that he gets well and can come back.  NO ONE ELSE can play Spartacus as well as he does.  He is Spartacus!
B004FOA84A|2.0|I was really looking forward to playing this based on the screenshots. Unfortunately, I solved it in about 20 minutes. Ending was abrupt and disappointing. Felt like a demo / teaser rather than a paid game. What a shame.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I wish there were more than 7 episodes that would make me happy ,other than that great show  !
B003AO1SVS|4.0|So......I had been hearing about The Black Keys quite a bit.  This album kept popping up on best of 2010 lists.  I saw them on Saturday Night Live and was intrigued.  Saw a video from the album and again my interest was ignited.  Finally, I took the plunge and bought the album.  At first I really did not get what the hype was about.  Yea, some of it was ok, but overall it really did not do much for me.  But.......damn, if I did not keep pulling the thing out once every two weeks or so to give it another shot.  Over time the album really started to grow on me.  Finally after many listens I think I do get what these guys are all about and I am really enjoying the music on this disc.  I do not have any of the band's earlier works, so this is my first exposure to them.  It is all pretty basic blues progressions with some decent guitar and keyboard work thrown in here and there.  The Keys cover similar territory to earlier bands like The White Stripes (whom I never cared for) and blues artists like Cedric Burnside and Lightning Malcolm (another band that does not do that much for me).  The Black Keys seem to present something different, however, though it is difficult for me to put my finger on exactly what it is.  Maybe it is the songwriting that as previously mentioned in this review seems to grow on the listener over time.  Songs like \\"Next Girl\\", \\"Black Mud\\", \\"The Only One\\", \\"Ten Cent Pistol\\" \\"I'm Not The One\\", and \\"Unknown Brother\\" all have that intangible it factor that make this a worthwhile listen.  The singles \\"Tighten Up\\" and \\"Howlin For You\\" have both received a lot of airplay and these guys appear to be on their way to a much larger audience.  I am still not sure why I like this album, but it is different and has grown on me like a fungus.
0061726826|5.0|Lena is 17 years old and a few months away from having the procedure that removes love from a person's brain. It was decided years prior to the book's start that love is what drives people to madness, and the removal of it creates a happier, safer world. Thus, when a person turns 18, they go under the knife, and are then assigned the rest of their life. In this safe world, people are told which college they go to (if they make it to one), who they'll marry, and what their eventual career will be. Everything is pre-selected, everything is safe.    But when Lena meets Alex, a young man who has beliefs she's never thought of before, she starts to think beyond the boundaries and sees a whole new world. As if living under a microscope on a fake movie set her whole life, she opens her eyes to a different world, and the possibilities that lie beyond her community's safe boundaries, and into The Wilds, where those who don't wish to conform live. With Alex and her best friend Hana by her side, Lena must decide what she wants - not what she's told to want.    While the theme of a perfect controlled future has been done - most recently in Matched by Ally Condie - the premise is different. (It's unfortunate that the two books came out so close to one another, because I feel as if Matched got the attention Delirium more-so deserved. Matched seemed forced, Delirium felt real.)    The world created reminded me of The Truman Show. Fake to the point of perfection. Glowing sunrises, sparkling waters. All perfect - and all convincing enough to stay for. Same with the procedure to remove deliria. For a second - a split second - I thought of my past boyfriends and thought, \\"yeah, it wouldn't be too bad.\\" That's how convincing Oliver is. Each chapter starts with a quote from a fake textbook that convincingly states why love is bad. Yet - is all love bad? When you look at it - no. After the procedure, the residents walk around like zombies almost - living, but not loving. No friends; it becomes a chore to visit family (as shown when Rachel, Lena's sister, comes to her graduation.)    What I wasn't prepared for was the amount of violence - which is incredibly necessary to the plot. It shows that not all things done for good are helpful - or even kind. Moments were utterly painful, especially when Lena sees what happens to people in The Crypts (the city's version of jail).    But what's most convincing about the story is the character development - and, honestly, the characters themselves. Lena is perfectly drawn - an in-between girl. Not quite pretty, but not quite ugly. Having lost her mother years before, she always lived by the book. I loved her confusion and intrigue, distance yet caring side. Complex, definitely, she was a fantastic main character who always had reasons behind her decisions. Hana is gorgeous with blond hair and long legs. She is the one that wishes for more, and seeks out advantages. And then there's Alex, who's undeniably gorgeous with hair the color of autumn and an addictive personality. He cares for Lena, which shocks her because in a world without love, care is hard to come by.    The book has a fluid pace, and gorgeous descriptions. While I wished for quicker dialogue at some points (I would skim to find when Alex would respond, as it sometimes took three paragraphs or so), the pauses, and descriptions poured into them, added to the scenes.    I think what was most shocking about the book was how much I found myself caring for the characters. Much like Before I Fall, the characters, specifically Lena, slowly matured throughout the book, creating completely different personas in the end. It was never forced, and the moments of realization were beautiful.    And then there's the end, which I won't get into, but I will say it left me crying. Crying! It's a powerful ending, definitely, one I'll vividly remember, full of bravery and hope. I suppose we'll see what happens next.    (That said, in a refreshing twist, there was nolove triangle! Finally!)    Delirium is far different from Before I Fall, but it has the same amount of heart. Heartbreaking and exciting, violent and sweet, it's an interesting and unique look at a genre that's been done. And I'm excited (and nervous) to see what happens next in the series.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Force quite once, then worked great. controls well on my droid x. Good music too. Can't complain since I got it on is free day!
B0016JBCJW|3.0|I won't complain about the acting or cinematography, but something was missing in either the story or the delivery. I like the story overall, but there was no real identification with any of the characters and I never had that 'ah ha' moment. It wasn't bad enough to stop, but it did leave me a bit disappointed at the end.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app.  The only thing I would have liked to see added is the ability to schedule recordings.  Everything else works great.  The layout is nice and minimal, but is intuative.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Challenging game that really requires you to think. I couldn't stop playing, but I think it only took about 30 minutes to finish it. I did get stuck on a part and had to look up what to do, but I really enjoyed this game while it lasted.
B003GWLVC0|5.0|I'm been on this earth 64 years & have always been a reader.  Now I am a listener to books & I have listened to this book at least 5 times, & have shared it with co-workers and all of us just know this is a powerful, powerful peace from a GREAT author/writer!!!   He also wrote: Bright Shinny Morning & the follow up book to A Million Little Pieces: My Best Friend Leonard. Both of them are a GREAT read or listen...highly suggest them!!!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Lame. App says that best local stations are restricted and cannot be played. Other stations that work fail after a couple minutes. Raleigh, NC. Evo.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I love action packed, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat movies, and Inception is 'all that' for sure!  So much so that I was emotionally, if not physically, exhausted by the time it was over.  Did Robin Williams write this?  :D
B004FOA84A|1.0|On my android all it does is crash and I never got to the first screen in do not recommend that you buy this application or get your own hopes up if you do
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The movie about Dr. Grandin's life is really an eye opener.  It's a wonderful true life story!  I have SO much admiration, and gratitude for her.  She is truly blessed!    Dr. Temple gives us first hand insight into Autism.  It shows us that we cannot underestimate or discount people with Autism.  (I believe this should hold true for any other handicap for that matter.)    So many people have learning disabilities, social shortcomings, diminished sensitivities, decreased perceptions, little to no tolerance, and so, so many other problems that handicap them.  These people, however, are the so-called 'normal' people.
B004FOA84A|2.0|This game doesn't go beyond the simple escape the room genre. The puzzles consist almost entirely of finding an item in one room and applying it in another room. It's passable for a half hour or so but the only way you'll get stuck is if you missed clicking something. There just isn't any real use of logic or problem solving. No replay value either. The best part of this game is its hilarious over the top app description.
B004FOA84A|3.0|i love this game but way to easy and way to sort. but it's worth the 99&cent; the game play is good not slow runs smooth and i had not probably with it and the graphics are great. so three stars from me. HTC evo
B0041EVYVK|3.0|I went with this album after listening to Daniel Lanois as a guest on All Songs Considered.  I enjoy the atmospheric guitar sound, production, and singing on this album but find the lyrics a bit too much on the gospel side for my liking.  Nice music and production, so-so-lyrics.
0385342055|2.0|I guess i rated this lower than the others as i didnt find it that funny to read about how spoilt can a child be, it was still ok but not as good as the other ones
B004XDYJRU|5.0|My biggest problem with listening to net radio going to and from work was skipping when the connection dropped.  With tunein pro dvr capability that problem is gone.  i just hit the pause for a minute or two before heading out and enjoy my stations interrupt free.  Also, tunein seems to have the largest selection of stations compared to any other streaming app.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|one of the best series i have ever seen    have read the books too but think the series is way more gory (which i like)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The free version of Tune In Radio is one of my favorite apps, and I love the ability to make recordings with the pro version. It works flawlessly on my Droid Incredible, the UI is simple and easy to use, and if you enjoy listening to the radio at all I would defiantly recommend downloading this app, especially since it is being given away for free today.
B004FOA84A|1.0|dosent work force closes on Droid x glad it was the free download of the day Mabye the developer should test the game on multiple phones before realesing
B004FOA84A|4.0|This was a fun game, well done, but oh-so-short.  I've been looking for something just like this for my Droid.  I can't wait for more!
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I really like this new album by Paul Simon.  Give it a spin.  It will surprise you from the first moment.  Thank you Paul.
B000002HHB|1.0|I'm glad to read some intensely negative reviews on this release.  I concur.  I bought both TigerLily and Ophelia after she left 10,000 Maniacs and tried to get into them.  Impossible.  10,000 Maniacs was truly a great band. Merchant's voice was an integral part of that greatness but she evidently wasn't the reason that the band was so good.  Her replacement, Mary Ramsey, proved the point.  The band continued its string of excellent albums without missing a single beat.  Merchant wasn't missed at all. I couldn't understand why she left 10,000 Maniacs and started a solo career but I loyally followed her over here.  Big mistake.  Sandy Denny she's not!    I've read elsewhere than 10,000 Maniacs with Mary Ramsey are recording a new album in 2011.  I'm very much looking forward to it.    As for Merchant, her success as a solo artist is utterly baffling.  There is just nothing here worth listening to.
B004FOA84A|5.0|In the past, I've had some pretty harsh things to say about the complexity and quality of the apps available for my Android device. Most of them are about the complexity and quality of the stuff I used to see for PalmOS 10 years ago - only in color.  This game is an exception - it has nice graphics and decent gameplay. The main drawback is the gigantic size of the app. Considering it ran just fine on my Droid once I moved everything else possible to SD, maybe the force closes were due to the devices running out of memory.  Yes, it is a bit on the easy side (took me about 2 hours to finish) and has no replay value. But, seriously folks, it was free yesterday and still under $1 today - still cheaper than two candy bars or a cup of coffee.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Well done game. Fun to play, and very nicely detailed and has some good puzzles. Haven't had a problem opening at all. HTC Incredible w/ CyanogenMod7
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I tried other radio apps on the Android market but TuneIn is the best I've come across. It has a bunch of radio stations the others didn't have including some HD radio! Pod cast shows and internet stations are a welcome treat too. It even has local police scanner channels which is a little weird to have but interesting.<br /><br />I do have a problem with the interface however using the app via my OG Droid. The wording is clear and informative but on the smallish side. When in landscape mode the TuneIn bar in the top of the screen is too thick, as well as the bar on the bottom that shows the play/pause/timer status. The rest of the info is pinched into a small area. On the left side is the station info, which is too small, and on the right are options that can really should be brought up on a different accessable menu screen. This setup isn't driver friendly where I use the app most of the time. Maybe a \\"car mode\\" should be called for where one could see the station's info and access some of your presets on one screen. As it stands now I have to go back one or two screens to see my presets. Not good when driving.<br /><br />Still overall the app is one of the best radio apps on the market. A winner it is.<br /><br />Update 7/27/12<br />Looks like the evil Clear Channel got greedy and took some of the stations away from TuneIn for their iheartradio service, which I'm not a fan of. Since I listen to only a few stations most of the time, I didn't notice the missing stations, which was done a while ago, but still, TuneIn has way more stations and content. They added a well needed car dock in the mean time which is good, but I would still like to see most of the stations I favor as big icons one screen rather than small lines of call letters.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Nice little myst-style puzzle game, wish there were more like this in the market.  Great job!  Got this as an amazon giveaway, but would definitely pay for a sequel.  Droid 2
B004FOA84A|4.0|pretty good game, glad I got it for free though. took some good developing skills though probably.. fun game, but now that I beat it, not much replay value. first time through only 25 mins.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It's such an original concept and is a serious page turner.  I'm a 28 year old mom of two young kids and I read the whole series in  less than a week.  Although it's a young adult book, it's definately a good read for all ages.  Highly reccomend!!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Decided to check this app out since it's free for the day, well I have to say my expectations weren't met...not even close. First off it didn't have any radio stations where I live albeit I live in a fairly small town. Second is when I selected a station a few hundred miles away (closest to me) out took quit a long time to buffer, and it was only loading a commercial. I give it credit for playing the commercial with no problem, but when it came time to actually play the station it failed rather miserably saying it couldn't connect.   To say the least I imediatly deleted, but I did give out a couple stars cause the interface worked fine and I'm sure others won't have problems finding local stations.
B004EWFV9K|3.0|If you've read Mankell from old to new, you already know that his political views often overtake the plots but his opinions are most strident in this last Wallender book.  It's also a mild swipe at the US, perhaps toned down by his growing US readership numbers.  The ending is too brief and disappointing, as if Mankell wants to get rid of the series but hates to see it go.  It's lazy and inconsiderate to spend so little time and effort on a character's demise and to end a book so abuptly.  (I find that many best selling authors just get lazy and cheat their readers out of what they deserve.   The longer they are best sellers, the lazier they get.)  Worth reading if you are a Wallender fan and you enjoy the way it meanders through his internal dilemnas and interprets his world from dark self-doubt.  If you've gotten this far in this Mankell series, you can put up with this perspective because it's the essence of this character.  It helps if you know a bit more about Mankell's personal politics because they permeate everything he writes.  I wasn't surprised by the abrupt ending, but irritated that Mankell gave it so little effort.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie is my favourite out of all the Disney/pixar movies. A great movie for any age! I have the single disc version and am very happy with it. A few extra features but mostly this is only the movie.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I was raised as an Episcopalian, and I have always felt that our religion focuses more on Christ's resurrection, while Catholicism seemed (to me) to focus more on Christ's crucifixion. I never understood why anyone would not want to celebrate the happier occasion (the resurrection of Christ, showing the power to rise from the dead). After watching this movie, I have a much better understanding of why some people wear necklaces with crucifixtion pendants, which before this movie I always thought was strange and a bit grotesque. After watching the brutal treatment of Christ in this movie, I now understand that the pendants are worn to remind the wearer of the huge sacrifice Christ made for man. The movie may be considered violent and gross, but I think all Christians owe it to themselves to watch it and to more fully realize the sacrifice that Christ made (not just giving up his life, but enduring a slow and painful death, with constant mocking, beforehand). To me, watching this movie is what Easter should be all about. In addition to learning about his tribulation, I really like how this movie is interspersed with backflashes of Christ shown in various \\"teaching moments\\" that all Christians will recall from the Bible. It is in these moments that those watching the movie, Christians and non-Christians alike, will see what his teachings were all about and what made people want to follow him, both then and now.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|great app. wish it would allow scheduled recording and saving as mp3 for storage. also rewind and fast forward button and live indicator would be nice to know when it's live or in buffer.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I wouldn't have wanted to pay for an escape-the-room style game when the genre is flooded with free Flash games. Nevertheless, this was a free Amazon offering, and it was fun while it lasted. I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it when it started force closing rather than opening, but it fixed itself after a few tries.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Only wish it was longer. Please add more levels or a new game, so I can play it some more. Love it, worked great on x.
B004FOA84A|2.0|nice little game but way too short and easy to complete. more suited as a 10 minute flash game instead of a paid app. unless you get this as a free app of the day, it is not worth the purchase price.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is an awesome game.  It is short, but the puzzles are challenging and make for a sweet playthrough. I hope they make a sequel.
B004R36QUE|5.0|This was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Great cast, great dialog, wonderful sets--a pleasure to watch.  You have to see this movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband really enjoyed this series so for his birthday I got this for him. It is very well done.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Always force closes on initial start up of game, fun great graphics but if the force close could be corrected this game would be a lot better. Samsung galaxy
B003VANOFY|4.0|Bought this as a replacement for my old logitech wired headset I bought 4-5 years earlier. First and formost, these are at least 3 times heavier than my previous set. My previous set feel almost weightless compared to these. However these have noise canceling features that are great for late night gaming sessions, but during the day, the feature is a hinderance more than a blessing as I'm inable to hear anything at all. Makes for walking around the apartment and interacting with others a little difficult. Which brings me to the next point. The range on these is far less than advertised. I'm able to get only 5-10 feet away before they are interupted, and 10-20 feet away before they cut out completely. The charge feature is nice, and the 10hrs of charged shown in the software application is nice too. Comes with a nice software supported suround sound instead of the actual. All in all, if you'd like a wireless headset, don't mind the short range, the weight, and lack of tru suround sound, then you'll be fine with these. Otherwise, you may want to go with a wired set from another company.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Works perfect for the SGS vibrant. The game had no loading or lag. There were small problems like it crashing when I locked my phone but the autosave was good. The last puzzle was not working well too. Otherwise tricky game that I needed to go to youtube to finish
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I moved to a different state and I was so glad to find this app couple months ago.  I never miss my favorite morning show.  Looking forward to recording now great for my busy mornings when I can't really pay attention to the radio.
B001AUKUUO|5.0|Back some 20 during my stoner days I used to constantly liten to this album and it's even better today. You will love it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|great app. straight forward and really gets you thinking. could do with being a little bit longer though. would recommend it to kill some time.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|Foo Fighters - Wasting Light is without a doubt a great album. The songs are well written. They take queues from the best of each of their albums to create 11 very strong songs. Dave Grohl's decision to record on tape is what really gives the music a much richer sound. There is depth to the vocals. The audio levels are not tweaked in ProTools. There isn't the tinny sounds over digital conversion. It is great. I purchased the vinyl knowing that wanting to listen to this album for the first time I would want to hear it how it is meant to be heard. The vinyl does also come with a 320 KBS MP3 download of the album for portable purposes. I was a little surprised by how the vinyl was pressed at 45 rpm, but no big deal since most players can handle it.
0316056863|3.0|I got to say, Tina Fey seems like a pretty cool human being, she was a late in life baby, quite heavy as a teenager, and she almost died on her honeymoon. She humourously writes about her dad , her costars on snl and 30 rock. Her take on breastfeeding is refreshing . Not everyone can do it, and in the end it is best to choose the best for you and not what people tell you.Oh and she makes these random lists like another writer I really like, but tina's are not as dry and pointy they are very genuinely, belly laugh funny.    But there is a big issue ruining this book for me.Maybe she is trying to be self loathing in order to be humourous, but the self hating is taken way too far. It is like she hates herself with a passion. Every other paragraph she makes fun of her butt or skinny lips or the scar on her chin that I never noticed until I squinted. She has done alot for the comedy genre in the past 10 or so years and she should pat herself on the back and be proud.  She has earned the right to be a little full of herself. Geez.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It did force close twice when first loaded on Xoom but then worked without problem.  An OK waste of a half hour, but the ending . . . really?
B00005214X|5.0|What has happened to the third album of the set named \\"AppleJam\\"? It is not mentioned as a third disc or anything else with this set. Where, or what has happened to it. Although, it was abit strungout, it was afterall part of the beatles history. I bought it many years ago, after I bought the single \\"My Sweet Lord\\" on a 45, with \\"Isn't is a Pity\\" on the B side.  Thankyou fred
B004FOA84A|1.0|they should pay me to have this useless app on my phone, waste of time and my life Dec should be banned from app store
B004FOA84A|2.0|Solved everything in about 30 min, except for the last bit, it is solved, but nothing happens.  I have even looked up walkthroughs to see if I missed something, but it is done correctly. Kind of a let down that I can't finish it even though it is solved...
B004EAQNO4|5.0|I don't want to give up any spoilers.  But yes, much of the film is done with 5 strangers in an elevator.  The devil is among them and they are all sinners.  The actors are mostly unknown, but they all do their part well.  I guessed wrong on who the devil was.  It's the least obvious choice, which I had considered may be the case.    The movie length is quite short at 1:20, but the pace is brisk.  There's not a lot of character development, but that would ruin the mystery I think. You will keep guessing and second-guessing until the very end.  I think it's a 5-star B-movie horror/thriller.  Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.  Peter 5:8.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|When I ordered this collection I was expecting to receive the metal cased edition, since I have the metal box cased edition for Band of Brothers. I received instead the cardboard boxed set. I was disappointed, but because it was such a great price, I didn't bother about it. All of the pictures showing the product I was receiving indicated to me that I was going to receive the metal box. Oh well I suppose. Besides that, it shipped quickly and arrived in great shape. The Series is also absolutely fantastic (totally on par with Band of Brothers). Defiantly NOT for children, EVEN with guidance, but great for history buff's like myself who enjoy detailed storytelling and dramatized facts of what REALLY happened. The show gets 5 stars. This order gets 3 because of not getting what I thought I was going to get. It would be nice to let the buyer know if it was the cardboard box set or the metal boxed edition... just saying.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|works great on my samsung vibrant. i can listen to stations that are not in my city as well as record for later playback. loved the basic version but this has more features.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|This is really a great little app.  It has nearly all the local AM and FM radio stations here in Nebraska, as well as NOAA weather radio and the Lincoln and Omaha police and fire departments.  Plus I can listen to radio stations in other states or even other countries.<br /><br />A word of caution: sign up for a RadioTime account BEFORE you start setting up presets in this app, because once you sign in, it will delete all your presets without warning and replace them with the presets from your RadioTime account.<br /><br />EDIT:  RadioTime is now TuneIn.  The updated version of the app now has a sign-in for a TuneIn account, rather than a RadioTime account.  They're the same thing, just a new name.<br /><br />SECOND EDIT: Supposedly the latest version of this app will no longer delete existing presets when you sign in to your TuneIn account.  I'd still play it safe and sign up for an account first.<br /><br />EDIT THE THIRD:  When I updated this app this morning, I discovered they have added new permissions.  They now want to read your contacts and use accounts on this device.  These are apparently for a new social media feature that is completely useless.  The new user interface is extremely confusing and poorly designed.  To access your favorite stations, for instance, you now have to press the tiny button labeled \\"My profile\\".  If you put it in car mode, your favorites are now under \\"Follows\\".  Yeah, that's totally obvious.  I can no longer give this app 5 stars, I'm dropping it down to just one.  It's just an awful app now.  Social media killed the radio star.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Real fun if you like puzzle games. Little on the short side. Battery pull allowed me to run the game without a Force Close. Droidx.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I'm not a big game person but figured I give this a shot. Glad I did. Fantastic game. It reminds me of Myst on the computer back in the 90s. Fun but not overly challenging puzzles keep the mind moving. Looking forward to the follow up games.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great graphics and a fun play. The puzzles are interesting and challenging, but not overwhelming. It is a bit too short, so could use more rooms and puzzles.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This was a great little puzzle game! It was short but it is also only a dollar. Not really any replay value but the initial time through was a lot of fun so worth it. I would love to see more of these types of games on the android. Especially something longer.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Very hard to get this game to work with the force closings but after a lot if tries of opening it opened. Great game when it works, keeps a person thinking upto the end.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|i was always curious as to how this game was before it was free, and now that i have it im glad..it is a very simple, yet addictive and challenging. runs very smooth with nice graphics on epic 4g.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Graphics looked great, storyline interesting...BUT....When i went to settings, muted sound effects and lowered the volume and the program was still super loud.  Shame, it seemed interesting.  Uninstalled.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Both entertaining and enjoyable.  The pictures are stunning, the music is excellent, the puzzles fun.  It does take a huge amount of internal memory, but runs great on my Droid.
B004RJZA1E|5.0|Best new metal band I've heard...probably ever. They have an awesome combo of great lyrics, incredible vocals, amazing power sound, and an epic feel. Love it!!
B0002JJBZY|4.0|I've been a fan of the series since childhood and when I decided to invest in the DVDs, I was most insistent they not be the \\"remastered\\" versions. Enhancing the special effects did nothing to enhance the stories and destroyed a portion of the charm the original series had. The pop-up commentary as opposed to voice overs is much less distracting and I definitely prefer it. I only wish there were more episodes with commentary. I'd also have preferred to see the episodes arranged in production order rather than by air date. I've had no trouble with the packaging thusfar, but I do not anticipate the cases holding up that well over the years. I purchased this used from a reseller so I didn't get all the outer sleeves, but I also paid considerably less. Still, I'm quite happy with my purchase.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force close on start up. Uninstall. wanted to play too. D s s s d fD s d d f f f f g g g g g g f  f f droid x
B004FOA84A|5.0|the most exciting game that kept me going all night, digging all the clues online with help forum, somehow got struck in bathroom....knew something about the wall. couldn't wait, finally I read walk-through guide to solve the mystery, what I wonderful game. I am just too dump and not remember things good enough to complete it myself.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|works well! love that i can get local radio stations im used to then keep listening when i travel. no more dead spots for me on the road!
030746363X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. In fact, even if you don't apply a single principle from it, I still would recommend it just for the entertainment value. I've read both the 5 star and 1 star reviews. Meh, to each his own. I know for myself, there are few instance in which I would want someone to form an opinion about me or my work based on the feedback of another.             I've found it available for as little as $13. If you can't swing that, get it from the library. Read it for yourself and form you own opinions. The author clearly challenges the reader in the early part of the book to not just take his word as gospel. There are several links and references to case studies that you can dive into, or just hit up Google and do your own research.         As an aside, I just looked up the Bible on Amazon and found some 1 star reviews. There are always going to be people for or against a work. Think for yourself!
0071752854|5.0|After reading this book I realize how much I have to learn about pitching any thing.  If you want to learn from someone who has proven that there method works buy this book. Interestingly, I  dont know if it will be the third, or fourth time that you look at this book review and realize for the first time just how important it is to purchase this book and to learn a proven method for closing deals.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Works fine on my evo. Short 2_3 hours game but fun.  I got stuck  a couple of time bird after a break I was aable to finish.
0767847431|5.0|It has been quite a while since I have seen this one and I do have the other two Harryhausen Sinbad films. This one is a bit longer and the pace is slower than the other ones but the acting and storyline is much improved. The actors look more authentic no blond haired blue eyed Sinbad here. What sets this one apart is the humor too and that there is a number of separate story arcs that come together with the main one. A shopkeeper in town pays Sinbad to take his lazy son to sea with him and make him a man. that addition is great where while the main story goes on the son serves as a bit of comic relief and he eventually becomes a useful member of the crew.<br />  It has the necessary elements and evil wizard with an over the top performance. His story is a bit more important here too as he ages from the use of his powerful magics. The concern of his henchmen over his aging and health. A beautiful girl but this time she is not a princess but a slave freed by Sinbad. The stop motion mastery of Ray Harryhausen is also here the fight with Kali is impressive with all her limbs.<br />  I am a big fan of Harryhausens work and have seen most of his films. They have more of a handcrafted look than today's films. This is why I like them so much and like to look at special effects extravaganza,s pre computer days. Ironic because I have spent quite a bit of time doing such work on the computer but still prefer the old school effects.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I agree with many of the other reviews: this is a fun little puzzle game with nice graphics and a good story.  My only complaint is that the game is too short.  When I got to the end, I really wanted to keep going.  I hope this developer will continue to make these types of games.    The game worked perfectly for me; not one single problem! Nexus S
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We first saw this on PBS and could only watch part of it. Luckily it came on the next night and the next...we were hooked. Our kids love the musicals and, with the exception of 2 'mutes' for mild language, we let them watch it as well. This one fit in with our collection very nicely. All performers are amazing and the picture is stunning for a live show. I heard the 10th anniversary performance is excellent as well and have seen some of it online via a certain \\"tube\\" site but performances stood out for us on this one. The kids love \\"Master of the House\\" and the individual performances are moving. Personally we did not mind the performance of Nick Jonas. True he is not as powerful a singer as the rest but he fits the look of the cast and did not do a bad job. Overall it is something to see and has re-energized our efforts to see it live along with others.
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|I woke up at 4 am this morning (jetlag) and started reading a few chapters of this book to make myself drowsy so I could fall back asleep. Bad idea. Once I started reading, Portia de Rossi's story completely absorbed me and made me more awake than ever. I did not stop reading until I finished the entire book and I am sure staying up the whole night has not helped the least bit in restoring my sleep cycle, but it was totally worth it.    De Rossi writes in a very easy-to-read manner, giving an honest and mind-opening account of what it's like to have an eating disorder. The bulk of the book focuses on her bulimia/anorexia, but she also sheds light on her struggle with her sexuality.    There are 2 sentences I remember most from this book:    1. \\"Baby,\\" [Ellen] says sleepily, \\"you were crazy.\\"     and    2. \\"I made the mistake of thinking that what I look like is more important than who I am.\\"     The first sentence pretty much sums up what I was thinking throughout the majority of the book. I was shocked at how she was able to live her life that way for so long. And I could not imagine having the energy for such long workouts on such small dietary intakes. As someone who has \\"fat\\" and  \\"ugly\\" days, I found myself relating to De Rossi's pursuit of... perfection in her own mind, I guess. Even though she was telling her personal story, I felt like part of me was woven into it even though I am completely unrelated and don't know her at all.     Halfway through the book, her detailed descriptions about her diet and specific actions were a bit long and repetitive, but the epilogue tied everything nicely together. I found the part about her saying goodbye to her eating disorder particularly touching. Often, people think that if you just eat more, then you wouldn't be anorexic and all of your problems would go away, but there's so much more to it than willpower and I think De Rossi did a beautiful job honoring the recovery process.     The most important message I got from the book is that while it's very easy to get carried away with your looks and trying to look better, you must never lose focus of who you actually are. What you look like is only a small part of the entire you. Given that De Rossi was (is) a Hollywood star who seemed to have everything, it made me feel more \\"normal\\" and at peace about my own flaws and quirky ways. The nosy person in me craved more details about her relationship with Ellen, but it makes me happy just to read about how happy and in love they are. It also gives me hope that one day I will be able to share that kind of happiness with someone.     A word of caution though: At the beginning of the book, I felt like this would be a great book for people with eating disorders to read. However, I am not so sure it would be the best idea. De Rossi goes into so much detail about her eating habits that people might use this book to learn how to develop or maintain an eating disorder instead of how to prevent or overcome one. That De Rossi continued to get jobs and even filmed a movie when she was at her lowest weight, also unintentionally perpetuates society's unrealistic standard that \\"thin is in.\\"     Ultimately, this is a good book and inspirational in a \\"if she did it, then so can I\\" kind of way. Would I recommend it to friends? Definitely yes.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|The app does what it says, and offers the option of selecting locations, language, etc. Moments after installing it I was listening to live Korean radio from my location in the U.S.A. Brought up a listing of all the local stations in my area in a second, and buffered the stream comparably to my hard-wired desktop. Just be certain that you have an unlimited data plan! It is fairly effcient for a streaming app at ~ 3 Mb of memory. The interface is intuitive. You will have to whitelist it if you are running Watchdog or a similar app that manages an app's share of the cpu and battery. You do need a free RadioTime account to preserve presets. Summary, a very good radio app that allows you to record, for free on 4/22/11. Why wouldn't you want this? BTW after I've run it for a while, I'll decide if it might merit a perfect 5 stars, which I generally reserve for flawless \\"must have\\" apps. Running on a Verizon DroidX.
B004FOA84A|4.0|good game on Droid x. although I had it beat on three hours. classic game. It is a good time killer. I recommend it for anyone.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Was intrigued by it on its free day even though other users of my phone said it would force close each time. I downloaded it and it worked! However, the next time(s) I tried it, it force closed like everyone said. Clearly not a problem with our optimuses its in the game. Please fix!  Also beware of its 16 mb + size on internal memory.
B004FOA84A|1.0|was not playable force closed on samsung intercept with android 2.2 now i will add some more non sensicle words to meet amazons silly twenty five word minimum
B004FOA84A|1.0|I installed the program and when I tried to run it, I received a forced close message.  I uninsulated the program and reinstalled and it still gave me the same error.  It will not let me move it to the SD card to see if that will help.  This looks like a fun program.  It is the first program I have had not work on my Virgin Mobile LG Optimus V.   If anyone has been able to get it to work on the Virgin Mobile LG Optimus V, please post.  If you are getting this for free, please try it. But if you are going to pay for it, be aware it may not work on your phone.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This app would not run on my HTC Incredible. Crashes on launch. Uninstalled and and wanted to reinstall but Amazon only let's me &quot;Open&quot;. It thinks it's still installed.
B004FOA84A|3.0|While the game was fun, it wasn't very long. I only opened it once, beat the game, and installed it. I'm generally a fan of puzzle games, but this seemed more guessing than logic. Overall it was decent, but I wouldn't pay for it.
B004FOA84A|2.0|The title says it all.  I finished the game in about an hour.  The graphic are good but the game was over just as i was getting interested.
1582701709|5.0|It is so shocking, so simple, yet so powerful that your mind will probably reject it the first time you read. That's what happened to me. I saw the movie, it made no sense to me at all. I needed two more years of wandering around, and collecting glimpses of the Secret in action to finally come back and read it again, and watch the DVD again. Now, it makes complete sense, and filling out pages of what Secret has been doing for me, small things and big things, every day!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I've been using the free version for quite some time and love it. Since the pro one is free today, decided to install it and see if there's a difference. Not much, really, but having the option to record is kind of nice. There have been a few shows I listen to that I wish I had been able to record.<br /><br />Edited review - 04/19/2012<br /><br />I love Tunein, but I just noticed this one is only on version 5.4 while Google Play's is 6.1. I used to be able to get all the BBC Radio channels with no problem, but as of yesterday I cannot access any of them. Uninstalled this version and will wait till it is updated. In the meantime I installed the free Google Play version and will use that to access my BBC Radio Channel presets, which come through with flying colors.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|If there is one sentence, thought worth remembering is that there is only love and lack of love, there is no opposite power to love. Ponder on it, and it will make total sense to you. The book is full of wisdom, and it's a total eye opener. One you read it, all of it will be obvious to you, and you will run out of your house excited to share it with the world. Your life will never be the same again.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Force close sometimes but was still worth it. LOVED this game!! Agree that it should be longer. Was a truly fun mystery puzzle. PLEASE COME OUT WITH A SECOND GAME! :-)
B004FOA84A|5.0|played it over lunch time and it was pretty fun, although quite easy. fun and free. nice. bird bird bird, bird is the 25th  word.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Lincoln Lawyer was my first from this author... I immediately downloaded \\"The fifth witness\\"  My opinion, it was better than Lincoln lawyer, which it no small task.  absolutely fantastic!  A must read
B003UESJHO|1.0|Saw  this in the theater and I absolutely loved it. I had to get it once it came out on dvd
B001MYIXAC|5.0|A very neat, decent film-making here. 'Let the right one in' is a vampire film that stays ahead of most vampire films, often witnessed by people. After witnessing brilliant performances from tho two main leads : Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson, all you can say is 'wow' and simply stare at these two children on the tv screen, specially Leandersson, who gives her almost every bit in her role, her facial expressions alone, easily make you read her mind, a similarly brilliant performance by Kare Hedebrant, who gives a genuine performance and you simply give out your heart to him. The feelings of friendship, love and sexual innocence portrayed by these two twelve year old children is something simply remarkable. The film, though slow paced sometimes, never looses its grip and maintains a horrifying atmosphere throughout. Worth watching.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I love Britney Spears' new album Femme Fattale. My favorite songs on this album are, Till The World Ends, Hold it Against Me, Inside Out, I Wanna Go, (Drop Dead) Beautiful feat. Sabi, Seal it With a Kiss, Big Fat Bass feat. will.i.am, Trouble For Me, Trip to Your Heart, Criminal, Up N Down, and Don't Keep me Waiting. Buy this album! It's a dancey album for Summer 2011!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|TuneIn works extremely well and has a lot of great of features. Love the ability to listen to live radio from back home. Much better than Pandora
B004XDYJRU|3.0|i really love the idea of this app and think it works great, but its missing at least 3 major pittsburgh stations, so i cant give more than 3 stars for something that i probably wont use.
0307593495|4.0|THE TROUBLED MAN is the tenth and final book in the Kurt Wallender series.  Mankell has allowed Wallender to age, to slide even deeper into the melancholy that made Kurt an unusual protagonist.<br /><br />Kurt is moving into an uncertain old age.  On the day he goes to lunch at a place where he is known well, he makes the mistake that changes his life.  He takes his service pistol with him and, inexplicably, leaves it at the restaurant.  The owner takes it to the police station and, after, a time Wallender placed on administrative leave, his future unclear.<br /><br />Kurt is nearly sixty when Linda becomes pregnant.  The father of her child is Hans von Enke, a banker and the son of a retired submarine commander in the Swedish Navy.  Hakan gives himself a seventy-fifth birthday party and takes Wallender aside to tell him a long and confused story about foreign submarines in Swedish waters in the early 1980's.  Hakan is the officer responsible for making the submarine surface but, before the submarine emerges from the deep water, Hakan is given an order to end the activity.  He never knows what country has violated Swedish waters but he believes it is the Russians.<br /><br />A few months later, Hakan Von Enke leaves for his usual daily walk and disappears.  His wife, Louise, knows nothing.  Hans is convinced his father is alive but has no idea why the family has not heard from him.  Then Louise disappars as well and Mankell crosses into Lecarre territory.<br /><br />I found the beginning of the book slow but once Kurt makes up his mind to use his skills and his contacts to find Hakan the book is more like the Wallender novels readers have come to expect.  Wallender is determined to provide answers for Linda and Hans.  Hakan's story about the submarines brings up the political confusion at the end of the Cold War.  And then there are the rumors about the very successful Swedish spy who has been giving military secrets to the Russians, a female spy.  What has this to do with Hakan?<br /><br />Writing a review that doesn't give away the story is difficult.  There are  many strands to this story and Mankell ties them all together at the end.  Mankell treats Wallender with dignity.  His health is failing and he has fears about his future.  The author leaves no doubt that this is the last Wallender book.  Mankell is letting him go.  Readers don't have to do so.  After reading the end, I am going to go back to the beginning and meet Kurt Wallender again.  He is one of fiction's greatest characters.review that doesn't give away the story is difficult.  There are  many strands to this story and Mankell ties them all together at the end.

B002VPE1YS|5.0|Odd to review a quilted case, but here goes. I'm somewhat of a fanatic in terms of keeping my electronics (in fact everything) in as-new condition. This inexpensive quilted case works out to be a very reasonable alternative to some of the very expensive custom, leather cases. It's not very glamorous, and can be a bit slow taking out of the case, but it does yeoman service in the protection area; and heck, it's pretty doggone inexpensive. I just wish there were a range of sizes.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Great puzzles. It was very fun. Wayyy too short; it was over after only an hour. I hope an update comes out soon with more.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This app force closes everytime I try to play.  Looks like fun but I cant even open it.  And why do I need a 25 word minimum on reviews when I can review with fewer words?  Makes no sense
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Okay; I didn't realize this was a remake when I saw it and I haven't seen the original yet.    That said: Let Me In is an excellent, thought-provoking film about good, evil, and the technicalities that bind the two in the world of an adolecent.  The vampire twist is simply a side-note in a story about when is it right to do the wrong thing.    The biggest plus in this film for me was McPhee and Moretz.  These kids both demonstrate acting talent well beyond their years and I look forward to seeing them in more roles. Their chemistry in this film was perfect and both their characters and their relationship is very believable.    Kudos to Reeves for not doing what could have been done to ruin this film: over-doing the gore.  The blood and body-parts in this are kept to a smart minimum.  The fire-scene in the hospital room had to have cost a pretty penny and was a well chosen use of the films SFX budget.    I highly recommend this film for mature audiences.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Boy, I feel like I watched an entirely different movie based on all the positive feedback I've read.      I really don't understand what has happened with the movie versions of the Potter series.  They have gotten progressively darker.  Literally.  The notice really began after the \\"Goblet of Fire.\\"  They may as well have shot the movie in a cave for I felt like that is what I was watching.  I have read every book and anybody watching this movie who has not, would be totally lost.  Half the time I was trying to figure out exactly what was going on.      All in all, a huge disappointment.  I keep buying the DVDs just so I have the entire series but this is one I doubt I would want to watch again.  Remember when Harry Potter was a \\"kid's movie\\" and was mystical and fun?  What happened?  I know they grew up and times became dark and troubled but I think it was taken a bit too far.  Perhaps Ron should have kept his Deluminator lit throughout the movie to \\"shed some light\\" on the action.      Best movies of the bunch, in my opinion, are the first three.  \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" and \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban.\\"       After watching Part 1 of \\"The Deathly Hallows\\" I know what to expect in Part 2.  DARKNESS.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Riveting and right on target as to what a Marine in combat experiences. As our World War II veterans are passing on daily, this book can't help but make you stop and thank all of them in your thoughts for the sacrifices they made so we can live in our USA today.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game is awesome! It has a great spooky feel. Ive been waiting for this genre of game for awhile now. It's exciting to see what will come out next! On the downside it felt to short or maybe it just left me wanting more!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Crap...App won't open...only force closes. I even restarted my phone...didn't help. I was  curious about this game. Fix the app and I will change my rating.  Mytouch 4g
1591843790|3.0|Guy Kawasaki has a phenomenal reputation and, since I had never read any of his previous books, I thought I would check this out.    The writing style is informal and breezy with touches of humor here and there so it makes the book an easy read.  However, he tends to get bogged down in places by going into way too much detail which may be appropriate for 2011 but may not stand the test of time.    Some of the reviews I've read of this book compare it to Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" updated for the 21st Century. I don't think so.  It's Guy Kawasaki's world view on how to get ahead. It's not really timeless principles for how to get along.    Of course since Guy made his name in the tech world as an Apple evangelist, the book is heavy on tech approaches to \\"Enchantment\\".  This is where it differs, markedly, from \\"How to Win Friends...\\".  Tech tools will come and go, the need to know how to engage with people on a personal level will never disappear.  Maybe it's the geezer in me but I think that people will still want to see, touch, smell rather than reach out solely through technology.    All in all, the book appears to be a synopsis of Guy's path to his particular spot in the universe.  He has been very successful and has carved out a life that he obviously enjoys thoroughly.  If you want the same life, this is the book for you.  Follow the recipe.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.01)<br /><br />I'll say it seems like it's working nicely for everyone else, so i'll revise my review if i get it working better. And as much as I definitely had several big issues, if you're reading this i'd definitely still give this a try.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lots of stations, and lots of features. There's plenty of radio apps out now, but this does have some great features. The menu's work well, definitely a nice UI. It's easy to set presets, and to find stations you're interested in..Whether that's by region or by genre. Features like being able to record, and pause and seek for live stations, are extremely nice to have. App looks and feels good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />This is where things went from good to worse. And again, this is just what happened to me, seems like others are doing better. I used this on the bus this morning, and have used other radio apps without issue, so i'm not going through any bad service areas. The first station i looked for wasn't here, then realized it was clearchannel controlled so i'm sure there not going to be on here. So I picked the local npr early edition station to give that a try. Took a minute to load, then after 20 seconds of listening it cut out and tried to load again. I thought, maybe it's just this stream. So I pick another station, same thing happened..cut out 3-4 times within a couple minutes of trying to listen. Every once in awhile when it was working, the audio would get real choppy. I tried to use the recording feature to capture this, so I could share that with everyone...It didn't work, not sure why. Tried several times, the recording never showed up in the recordings area. I'll have to dig through folders to see if it's somewhere else. I tried to get this going for about 30 minutes, restarting it several times, failed miserably. Even when you pause streams on this app, one thats working and playing ok at the time being, when i hit play again it had to rebuffer...really?? I thought that might help, pause and let it buffer, nope.<br /><br />Worth buying?<br />Honestly, i liked the app, if it worked..and I'm going to try it again later today, maybe it was a fluke. So I'd say if you try the non-pro version(or just grab the pro today), and it works, totally worth the money.use and let it buffer, nope.    Worth buying?  Honestly, i liked the app, if it worked..and I'm going to try it again later today, maybe it was a fluke. So I'd say if you try the non-pro version(or just grab the pro today), and it works, totally worth the money.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|thought the book was an enjoyable read just hope there is a sequel because  i did not like how it ended.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|If you're curious about this, it's pretty likely you've been to ultimate guitar. Huge collection of tabs, a lot of features, etc. The site works great, and now, so does the mobile version. Honestly, so impressed with this app, it just plain works. The searching is fast. You can transpose songs, as well as clicking on chords and seeing variations. The top 100 tabs are easy to get to, although i wish they didn't have drum tabs mixed in. But seriously, with the amount of features packed into this app, it's worth every penny. I can't say enough good things, and really no complaints. If you play guitar, and you have an android phone, buy this. You will definitely not regret the purchase.<br /><br />Phone: Droid X(2.2.1)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|now I can record the Bert show very cool.  you should not have to leave 25 word minimum for the review tune in radio = awesome Amazon appstore fail
B004J1DBJI|4.0|I'm extremely impressed by this service. I hadn't used the website in a very long time, it's come a long way. Math is fantastic, seeing the solution and the steps to get to the solution, amazing. And when I started putting in ridiculous equations, i started realizing just how powerful wolfram is. Can divide the speed of light by the population of mexico..Will you ever need that? no. But is it impressive that this will do that for you, yes. And i'm sure theres a million great uses for this. Goes well beyond math, use it as a great resource for anything from science, to a dictionary. So many rating this, making it sound like it's just an app. Go to their site, and use the wolfram service there. If you like it, and find it useful..Then the app is totally worth the money.
B004FOA84A|5.0|sad I had to look up one spot but amazing. game keep force closing on me a. s well but a reboot fix that. similar to shadowgate for the nes
B004XDYJRU|1.0|doesnt carry the clear channel stations. one of my favorite stations in san diego is not listed. would be a great app if it would carry that.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I downloaded this on Kindle for Blackberry. Let me tell you, when I was required to read this in the middle of the school year, I did not think I would be this addicted. I was so happy to find out that Amazon had this for free so I immediately downloaded it. I read this book on my phone every morning and every afternoon. I actually don't mind the rest of the techs as long as I didn't have to flip through pages on the subway.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app for streaming radio!  I was able to find stations that other apps didn't have.  I have only used the free version so far but definitely looking forward to trying the recording options.
B004FOA84A|4.0|worked great on my droid. it made you really think. loved the puzzles, graphics and story line but its too short. a sequel would be nice.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is singing from somewhere deep within herself on this CD.  Every song will bring someone to mind that has come into your life and made you feel some kind of way.  At first listen, I wasn't too fond of it because I'm a \\"beats\\" person so usually if the beat isn't great I'll pass on it.  I listened to \\"Don't You Remember\\" one day when I was just relaxing and I'll be damned if I have not been hooked every since.  I have one CD for the house and one for the car.  My favorites are \\"Rumor Has It\\", \\"Don't You Remember\\" and \\"One and Only\\" but I love the CD in its entirety.  Adele is on and inviting you to a whole new level of feeling and I am glad to up there with her.  If you have not heard it...you are so late.  Stop reading and order or just got it all ready, you won't be disappointed!  I can't wait to get in my car and hit repeat....
1416987126|5.0|This book is so cute! I love the story!! But, unfortunately, it doesn't hold my son's attention for the whole thing. He gets bored with it easily... I think maybe when kids can read it themselves or if you are a preschool or kindergarten teacher you should definitely have it! It would be A LOT of fun in a daycare/preschool setting!! It is kinda long though...
0525422943|5.0|Don't miss IF I STAY and WHERE SHE WENT! Once you finish you will not forget the amazing characters! I loved Mia and Adam and Gayle's writing is absolutely brilliant. A must read.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|love this app and looking forward to using the Pro version.  never had any issues wit the free version.   really looking forward to using the record option.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force close on start, even with reinstall. Cant install to sd, so takes a lot of space. Looks like a lot of others having same problem going by ratings. Optimus S 2.2 stock.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I got stucked on one part but I cheated a little, it was right at the very end. I enjoyed it, it reminded me a little of Monkey Island. relatively short game. I recommend it!
B004FOA84A|5.0|It should really be 4 starts  because of the length of the game but I absolutely love games like this and I wish there were more like it. Have the droid x and no problems or force close. I played the game in one sitting with no problems. It was alot of fun and it got my brain thinking.  When is the next one coming out?
B001E45XT4|5.0|For 25 bucks, there isn't a better headset for gamers on the market.    Let me point out that I've had both the \\"Open Ear\\" AND \\"Closed Ear\\"  versions of this headset, and there's really no difference, so go   for the cheaper one.    Until you are ready to spend over $150 on a headset, don't waste your  time with anything else.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|not a lot of local stations the biggest in my area isn't on here however the smallest is on here so I hope to see more added over time
0307272702|1.0|My father and his three brothers turned  their  backs on their immigrant parents'  Mediterranean diet. My grandparents ate mostly vegetables and pasta plus chicken once a week. My father and uncles  ate red meat three times a day (bacon and sausage for breakfast, cold cuts for lunch and beef or pork for dinner.) My father licked his colon cancer, but  his three brothers succumbed to  cancer despite the fact that neither of their parents suffered from such malignancies. Taube is hardly convincing to those of us who have seen the effect of his recommendations.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|After reading the substantial negative reviews, I was afraid that Zagg had taken a dive in their production practices, but when I received the item, it was professionally packaged and instructions were included. The only tough part was that there really aren't any instructions for the side pieces (the ones that cover the metal bands on your iphone 4)  I looked at the picture on the front of the package and realized that the pieces shown on the package are different than the ones included:  in the package photo, there are two strips that go on the right side, presumably to allow for the removal of the sim card without having to take the Zagg strip off.  What was included though, was one large strip that completely covered the side, including the sim slot.  I have no reason to remove my sim, but if you do need to remove yours periodically, this package isn't going to work for you.  Installing the strips over the bands was difficult, but manageable.    Application seemed a bit easier than on my old 3g, due largely to the flat back of the iphone 4.  Also, contrary to many of the early reviews posted here, I found the pieces to be cut extremely precisely and to fit like a glove with some patience and maybe a little assistance with the hair dryer.  The area for the home button is probably 1mm larger than the actual button, but I figure that is most likely to allow for the case to adhere better to the rest of the phone.  I did notice when applying the side pieces that you can pretty easily inadvertently stretch the strips if you aren't careful.  If it happens, just let them sit a few minutes, shrink back down, and start again.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and look forward to showing off my newly naked iphone 4.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Fun but could use a hint button and make the game itself longer or have different plots. Also the volume for the music and SFX do no turn off.
B004HWR406|5.0|Good movie, great cast, and the characters are very well created. Just wish it was more \\"fact based\\"!!!  This is truly a wonderful story of DAVID AND GOLIATH which should be told using \\"FACTS\\"!!!<br /><br />Best of all, Mark Zucherberg, is a normal guy with IDEALS and GREAT IMAGINATION....A BEAUTIFUL MIND!!!!
B004X4R49Y|3.0|I looked forward to seeing this movie, considering the reviews and awards it received. When it reached our little town, I went to see it. It's a very pleasant movie, but hardly great. I really can't see why it won so many awards. I like all the actors, good story but a little thin.    Good representation of just how awful the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were, however.    Nice to see Helena Bonham-Carter with her hair combed.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Don't really like Mandy Moore, but man, she did an INCREDIBLE job with this character!!!  The storyline is perfect, lots of OPTIMISM, REAL LIFE ISSUES, AND MOST OF ALL.......A TIMELESS LESSON THAT EVERYONE SHOULD LEARN.... \\"STAY POSITIVE, THINK POSITIVE, AND YOUR HAPPY ENDING IS JUST A DREAM AWAY!!!\\"
0143117009|3.0|Fhis was a gift for my husband. It was recommended to him by a fellow commettee member. He was very interested in reading it.
B004FOA84A|3.0|so as i started in i was stricken with happiness to what seemed to be a great mystery game.  less than an hour later it is over and i am left with an under whelming experience.   good for free but theres no way id spend money on this.  fun though!! really fun!
B004FOA84A|5.0|if you enjoy the old classic &quot;mist&quot; yhis is right up there. never had a problem getting it to work. the graphics are very nice and tge music sets the mood. hopefully the developer will add more levels as this was a real treat. EVO 4G
B004SF30HI|5.0|A fun trip to Brazil.. It wouldn't have been so much fun without the Brazilian beats the birds showing off their dance moves!! Be sure to Watch the movie before you purchase the audio track..
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Dear Mr Lucas,    Please sell me the versions I watched in 1977, 1981 and 1983..  NOT your special effects remakes.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Everything about the cloud player is great. But, as of late I've been experiencing too many force closes. I have a droid and it gets hung up while scrolling my artists in the cloud. Also, the app player and the widget are  lacking features that make it an intuitive player. I still love this as my chosen device player. Look forward to the next iteration.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|enjoy the angry birds games, but the Easter one is too hard; don't want easy but doable for a few levels would be nicer; glad I didn't pay for this
B004XDYJRU|3.0|It works decently enough. Sounds and plays good. There are a few local stations in the couldn't find, but otherwise it is a decent app.
B004L49K20|5.0|I wanted to review the deluxe edition when it first came out, here in Canada, but there was a delay, due to the Quebec regional sticker. It delayed the in-store release of the deluxe edition by a little over a week. Anyway, when we got home, we threw it on....and...well, what can I say? I'm totally blown away!<br />I AB-SO-LUTELY LOVE it! Duran Duran have definitely returned to their roots this time. I know I liked and enjoyed the \\"Astronaut\\" deluxe edition very much, but nowhere near as much as \\"All You Need Is Now\\".<br /><br />To be honest, I think we only played \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" CD twice. I don't remember anything on that album. But now, the tables have definitely turned!<br />In fact, the tables have so f-ing turned, it's not even funny! I'm still catching myself being caught in amazement at how excellent this whole album is.<br />What else could a Duran Duran fan ask for?<br />Right now, I'm debating going to see them at their very soon up-coming performance here in Montreal. The only thing holding me back is the fact that they removed all the seats in the venue, so everyone has to stand........and, knowing how crazy it was for DD's last performance here in MTL recently...I presume the crowd will be there in even greater numbers.<br /><br />Anyhow, as for the packaging...I wish the CDs were protected in little sleeves of some sort, because, in this digi-packaging, the discs slide into a pocket on the far end of each side of the digi-pak. It will probably cause lots of scuffing and scratching on the disc's surface(s).<br />That's the marvellous thing about extracting the discs and putting them on my i-pod & i-phone, which this album I play quite often.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't look or glance through the liner notes booklet, because I don't have to. All is good and I'm happy enough with this amazing music.<br />AYNIN is a nice long album with lots of full-on, in your face material, just like back in their earlier days.<br />I've no favorite or least favorite track(s) and no complaints about anything either.<br /><br />I highly recommend this ablum to all new & current Duran Duran fans. It will definitely NOT disappoint you! Go & get it before they raise the price on it!her.    I highly recommend this ablum to all new & current Duran Duran fans. It will definitely NOT disappoint you! Go & get it before they raise the price on it!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Nicely done, a fun little game, reminiscent of the old game Seventh Guest. Nice atmospherics. Graphics are nicely evocative of Disney's Haunted Mansion. Overall, a well done little game.
B004FOA84A|3.0|None of the puzzles are difficult and there are not that many.  This game did keep me occupied for a couple of hours though.  I am glad I did not have to pay for it. $.99 might be too much for what it is.  It will be interesting to see if there is a sequel.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Evo 4g worked great Cheers to you not too hard but not super easy either.opened a couple times. great grafix. gladit we free tho cause I finished it in about 30 min
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was actually pretty fun.  A bit short but we'll thought out.  Reminds me of the old Sierra games days.... minus 7,000 ways to die. Would love to see more games like this.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've used this for months and I LOVE it! it doesn't get much better than this! get it for free always in the market though....
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Product was delivered much quicker than I expected.  I appreciate how easy it is to find what I am looking for.  As usual ordering was very simply as well.  My favorite way to shop.   Winter's Bone is a great movie.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a very well put together app. The quality of the streams is great, they have everything from local stations to international to internet. Some people freak out at the permissions but it is just licensing and nothing to worry about. I highly recommend this app for anyone who likes music.
B004KRWQLU|1.0|Do NOT I repeat do NOT buy the MP3 version of Welcome To My Nightmare here... For whatever ridiculous reason they give you the single version of the title track which is over 5 minutes long but here is a mere 3 minutes but if that wasn't enough Only Women Bleed which is another popular hit on this album is also edited this song is in fact over 5 minutes also & here on the MP3 version is only 3:36 A COMPLETE & TOTAL RIPOFF!!!! Fans see for yourself compare the times if you don't believe me...... Tom
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Until you release the original films in their original state without all the added CGI foolishness, my money will stay in my pocket.     Don't think I am serious? The last version I bought of the original trilogy was on laser disc.     And the less said about the prequel trilogy, the better.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This film is an absolute joy to watch. The artistic use of color and beautiful scenery alone would make it a fascinating view of the artist's impressions of heaven. That being said, the romantic story that holds it together works incredibly well. Robin Williams fits perfectly into this movie. He manages to convey the right sense of emotion for each scene, yet remaining capable of the occasional odd bits of humor. Everything just fits together so well in such an emotional masterpiece.<br /><br />I have never read the book. That being said, having read some of Masterson's work and reading the differences between the film and book I can say this is probably a much more enjoyable movie for its genre. If they were to have been true to the book I'd imagine it would be much less of a beautiful love story, and much more of a metaphysical view of the afterlife.
B004FOA84A|2.0|the game looks promising and is fun, but is way too short!  great graphics. would love to see another, extended version of the game, perhaps a sequel?  I gave 2 stars only due to the length of the game and goofy ending.
B004FOA84A|5.0|A bit short but hope to see more if this is truly just the epilogue... 4 stars only due to the length...extra star for quality lol!  we want more !  great job!
B004FOA84A|2.0|love the game style. it was a fun little thing, however the shortness and over simplicity of the puzzles made me feel like i played a demo. i am by no means downing the dev, in fact i wish to ask for more. you could even say i challenge the dev to make something bigger and more in depth. great concept, fun game, but pleeeeeeeeeeeease make a new better longer game.
0307398552|5.0|Nigella Lawson represents all that a kitchen is supposed to: warmth, bounty, nourishment, primitive desires. Nigella hits it out of the park in this delightful book that will have you whistling to yourself while on a crowded elevator.<br /><br />At its heart, this is a book about reflection. And I don't know if Nigella ever gets out of the shower and takes a good look in a full-length mirror, but it's an exercise that I think she'd get a lot out of, I know it's gotten a lot out of me.<br /><br />Nigella is smart, funny and I imagine openminded. That's what separates her from the other celebrity chef. She's stacked with admirable traits, while the other just seem to have one-dimensional, flatter personalities.
B004OBQDH0|5.0|the dobby in the picture is exactly what it looks like. The teeth are a shaped a little weird/creepy/scary (for kids). Its seems like it would have been better marketing if they made dobby as cute/loving as his character is rather than having his teeth look pointy and his stance look like hes scared, but its still cool and the person i bought it for loves it. the movie played fine.
B00408MS5S|4.0|So...\\"Breakfast in America\\" has been remastered yet AGAIN (how many times is this the third or fourth time?). Is this one better than the last? Not really but the real reason to get this is the second live disc. How does disc one sound? I wouldn't sell your original Mobile Fidelity or early CD pressing of \\"Breakfast in America\\". This mastering sounds decent but not horrible. Some of the problems with the original masterings are IN the original recording and the specific type of console that was used to record/mix the album.<br /><br />Disc two features songs cut from \\"Paris\\" (due to time constraints when it was on vinyl back in the day)from the same series of shows--six songs to be precise according to the liner notes. There are also six OTHER songs that are from other shows on the disc. Since some of these songs didn't appear on \\"Paris\\" (or anywhere else) such as \\"Oh Darling\\" and the epic closing track \\"Child of Vision\\" both from \\"Breakfast in America\\" this is well worth picking up.<br /><br />The second disc was mastered by Tim Young at Metropolis Mastering (they've done good and bad work over the last couple of years) and sounds pretty good over all but keep in mind we have nothing to really compare it with.<br /><br />What would have been a better release? Include the original album, the live disc included here and the DVD of promotional videos (that were included in the deluxe edition which is about $200 depending on where you buy it AND includes vinyl versions plus assorted other goodies)and/or create a stand-alone live disc celebrating the album \\"Breakfast in America-Live\\" including all the tracks here plus the rest of the songs performed by the band on the tour and/or include a SACD hybrid disc since those probably buying this would have the equipment to listen to it anyway.<br /><br />Should you get this? If you're a fan you know the answer to that but try and get it for under $20.00 as you'll find yourself listening primarily to the live album if you have a better version (the Mobile Fidelity CD, the original A&M CD that has the Audio+ logo on it or the original vinyl) of this to listen to. I have to disagree with some here--the mastering on this edition sounds slightly better to me than the 2002 edition also mastered by Greg Calbi. Whether that's because of improved A/D conversion equipment or other reasons, I'm not sure.idelity CD, the original A&M CD that has the Audio+ logo on it or the original vinyl) of this to listen to.

0061841935|5.0|Craig Ferguson tells us his rather painful story with wit, charisma and Scottish charm. (This review is for the audio version - which he also reads) Starting from his early years and childhood memories, on though his nightmarish public school experiences in Glasgow and on through his decent into rampant alcoholism, I found myself rooting for him and his self deprecating manner. When he finally started turning his life around, I found myself mentally cheering him, as if I actually knew the man (which I don't). I like the audio version, frankly, because I just like hearing the him talk.      I originally became interested in CF when I saw a U-tube video of the Late Late show, where, in his monolog, he refused to tear into Britney Spears during her melt down as all the other late night hosts were. He felt it would be hypocritical in the extreme to do so. I thought that was pretty honorable and decided to buy this publication. I wasn't disappointed.
B004FOA84A|4.0|A bit short but a fun game anyway.  challenging without being to difficult.  Graphics were very nice too.  I didn't have any problems with fc.  Droid Incredible.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|I'm a jazz fan but not a jazz expert.  I like this because it is new and interesting and sonically very good - and - it's not your usual be-bop type of jazz at all but is maybe a new category of jazz (but I wouldn't know what to call it.)
B004FOA84A|3.0|super cool game but force closes every time i try to open it...only opened after initial install and then i let my phone lock and it force closed and hasn't worked since...i would really like to finish it :(
B0049P1VHS|1.0|I love the horror genre, love zombies and love commentaries on society.. I did not however love  This show... Well... Sort of... The first episode was tremendous, the second quite good...   And that's when things went downhill... One dimensional cardboard cutout characters combined with   assanine storylines made this show fly off the rails... I was embarrassed on several occasions (Vatos)...  The main actors did the best they could but their efforts were squandered by   halfass direction... The hype for this show is unwarranted and the human element they   were focusing on is forcefed to the viewer. You have been warned.
B004FOA84A|5.0|if you jave the patience for it its a fun game that alwaus surpries you and its fun to play since i got it for free. but yea i would recommend it.
B004ISVH6G|4.0|The legendary underrated rock singer-songwriter John Waite is back with a great new CD titled 'Rough & Tumble'. The CD is a balance of rock, bluesy & ballad tracks and the CD grows on you (more appreciative) with more listening! Amazon lists 10 tracks but my CD (from Amazon has \\"Hanging Tree\\" as the eleventh/closing track). The opening track \\"Rough & Tumble\\" : a great rock track with great vocals. The 'blazing' lead guitar intro is great & its sound is prominent throughout the entire song. Other great tracks include \\"Evil\\" (melodical track with wonderful guitar overdrive), \\"Skyward\\" (great mid-tempo track, starting okay with a rather great build to the chorus), \\"Further The Sky\\" (bluesy rock track with great guitar intro & great vocals), \\"Love's Goin' Out Of Style\\" (interesting/lovely guitar/drum intro, great bluesy guitar overdrive with great melody/lyrics 'she took me for a ride And I guess love's goin' out of style'), \\"Better Off Gone\\" (great guitar intro reminiscent of that in John Mellencamp's 2007 title track \\"Freedom's Road\\") & \\"Hanging Tree\\" (a slow, mellow but great closing track). My favourite track/gem/solid track is \\"If You Ever Get Lonely\\" : a beautiful ballad with a wonderful chorus reminiscent \\"Missing You\\" or \\"When I See You Smile\\". This my stand out track from this great CD & hence the title of my review. Okay tracks include \\"Sweet Rhode Island Red\\" (heavy guitar intro & up-tempo vocals. It's a 1974 Tina Turner's song, its interpretation could have been more inspiring), \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" (a bluesy rock track that starts quite well but the build up not spectacular, it's John Waite's 1982 composition) & \\"Peace Of Mind\\" (okay alternating 'talking' & 'singing' vocals). On the overall, this is a CD release that grows on you with more listening, well balanced (rock, bluesy & ballad track) from rock's talented underrated singer-songwriter John Waite, a highly recommended CD listening.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This was a great movie. It gives a great view of the big picture. I do not know a lot about the finance industry, this movie broke down the financial crisis in a way that anybody can understand. It is just insane how these guys got to get rich at the expense of the entire country. Not to mention bringing down other countries financial systems in the process. Just blows my mind. You must see this movie.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I managed to get to the last puzzle and I solved it. But it doesn't progress. It is as if the app isn't recognizing that I solved the puzzle. So I haven't seen the end. But other than that I find it interesting.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Fun game. A bit short, but I would look at their next game in order to have a diverson for a while. Works fine on a tablet.
0375846735|1.0|This whole book was a fail the first two books were amazing but this book just left you with like ten questions. Ok what exactally is this temtation that the world is counting on? Lyra is nothing like Eve. How exatally did Mary tempt Will and Lyra? By telling them a stupid story (about marzapan no less) to make them fall in love? To make Will and Lyra stay together? And where did this love come from? Am I reading an adventure fantasy or one of those cheesy romances where two people fall in love at the last just for someing heart wrenchiing to happen. And if there in love they shouldn't have to leave each other like that. It's so depressing!!!I cried for a while. They coulden't just leave 2 windows open!!! How stupid can you get. What they fell in love and the dust just majicly started falling down on the giant oily trees again.  And why did Lord Asriel and Miss Coulter sacrifice themselfb to Lyra. Remember whenshe was in the cave and he coulde'nt get her he gave up he did'nt really care, and Miss Coulter tried to kill her!!! And the mulefa what part exactally did they play 9it was just a crazy random strange book. And again it wouldn't be that bad really if Will and Lra didn't haveto leave each other 4 ever two windows people thats all it takes 2 windows!!!  and they just left it alone without argueing with the angel about it they could've been a little more passonate. And the thing is he did the first 2 books so good and i knew the caricters almost personally thats why when they had to leave each other it was so painful it acctually hurt me when they they left each other!!!!! It would have been better if he only summed it up better explained things better(like the sudden love then dust falling right thing) and if will and lyra could've stayed together that was really sad. NOT A GOOD CHILDRENS BOOK CUZ OF THE SAD SAD ROMANCE THING THAT CAME OUT OF THE BLUE, AND THE CONFUZING PLOTs. PLUS I\\"M STILL CONFUSED ABOUT THE SUDDEN MA + PA CHANGE OF HEART. THIER LYING DECIETFUL PEOPLE THAT DIDN\\"T CARE ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTER 4 YEARS. WHY CARE NOW? CUZ SHES IMPORTANT? I MEAN THE HEAD OF THE COLLAGE HAD 2 GIVE HER MONEY CUZ HER AFUL LAMO PARENTS DIDN\\"T LEAVE HER A DIME!!!!!! VERY DISAPIONTED!!! I FELT LIKE WRITTING PULLMAN A LETTER EXPLANING MY SADNESS AND DISAPIONTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B004FOA84A|4.0|I'm generally not that great at games like this... I frustrate easily. But this was a good one. It didn't take me too terribly long to sort it out, but I certainly felt accomplished when I did. Short and sweet. It did force close on me a couple of times but always restarted quickly without losing data.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Downloaded the game thought I would give it a chance. First it loaded my memory and I couldn't move it to sd. Then it wouldn't even open.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have used the free version for a while and just updated to pro. works great for listening to sports broadcasts of my college team.  works great!
B004FOA84A|5.0|I also had constant force closes on my Zoom, but restarting let me get past those problems and I'm working ok now. looks like a pretty good game.
B004K4IZ54|3.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />If you like out of screen effects, this movie is NOT for you. After 23 minutes of 2D, the 3D portion started. About an hour went by and I still could not say there was even one small OOS effect. Near the end of the movie there were a few 5% to 10%ers and 1 at almost 25% of the way from the screen to the viewer. The in-screen 3D seemed lackluster with a somewhat shallow depth field however the 3D that was there had very few flaws.<br /><br />***  OK In-Screen 3D BUT Lacked OOS Effects  ***<br /><br />MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.<br /><br />Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds
B004FOA84A|2.0|I was able to play the game for about 15 minutes before it forced closed... it would never run again.  tried clearing app data, removing and reinstalling, and rebooting all to no avail. Shame, it was pretty cool.  :(<br /><br />DroidX, Android 2.3.3
B004FOA84A|4.0|great puzzles, that had me scratching my head. some of the puzzles were genuinely. a challenge.  :),<br /><br />my only complaint is that it was pretty short :(
0525422943|5.0|Wow! I have to admit, I was a little unsure of how the story could continue after such a powerful ending in \\"If I Stay\\". While I'll admit, I have read many books, with a very similar plot. What most impressed me about this book is how, while three years had passed, you still gain the whole story of what has been happening to Adam and Mia.     In this book, you gain more insight into Adam, how his life has changed and how things have affected him. While I tend to be a sappy romantic and don't mind a plot I am familiar with, what I found most captivating about the book is Adam's journey. In \\"If I Stay\\" we get to see Mia's journey in having to make a huge decision, in \\"Where She Went\\" we are able to see how that decision has changed and effected Mia, but more we see the journey and the struggle that Adam has had to endure.     The strongest message is how powerful love can be, but also, how massive trades can hinder us from loving and allowing us to hang on to what we hold most dearly. I have to say, this book was a wonderful journey to read and a wonderful story of how love can endure more than we ever believed was possible and in the end can save us.     Well worth the read!
1936719045|3.0|I agree with other reviewers in that this book felt like a summary of the War of Art. Furthermore, it wasn't as well put together and felt rushed when compared to Pressfield's previous book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|this app straight up delivers, the streams are good and it has a ton of stations available! definitely recommend it especially because since it's free today
B004FOA84A|5.0|the game is really good..and its only a dollar on any other day...the only downside is the game can be solved quick..little tough but once you find the next clue its opens more ways of doing stuff
B004FOA84A|3.0|The game is very nice and brings me back to a time when I was young and these were popular. However, as many people have said, it is not that difficult and your can breeze through the whole game pretty quickly. The graphics are nice and it's pretty charming.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I was really looking forward to this, but it force closed every time I tried  to open it. Very disappointing... I hope they can fix that.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Worked great, looks good. Don't understand the complaints. Its a small, one dollar hidden object game. Does its job well with clever but simple puzzles.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|After downloading this app, I refuse to install it. The app requires to many permissions to run... does it really need access to my phone calls?
B003N1I3SO|5.0|I don't understand much of french but I think the music carries good power and still plays emotion through me.  I play it for everyone!  :)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|App streams music from internet.  It loads fast and it has good quality. Biggest diversity in local radio, didn't even know all the stations existed. Very nice jobwith this app.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Amazon is selling android apps but for some reason gives apple the more superior app. two page option us not available for tablets. there are multiple formating issues that do not occur with an iPod app with similar books. indexes and tables look terrible.  email them and they say theyll work on it. new update same problems. only better is text doesn't span entire screen like in 2.0. this added a star. go with another company
1416550550|3.0|I was about to purchase this for my kindle, but it costs twice as much as the softcover edition.  Now I'm irritated and will buy neither.  Amazon, this is a great model for killing your business....
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I can play almost anything from anywhere. Great product, but beware if you need to move it to the SD card... the older versions didn't permit that.
B003UESJF6|4.0|I liked it. There was a cute new premise and good art. The kids have watched three times since I got it.  That's how I tell if they reached their target audience.  The kids and I both laughed hard during the movie (at different times of course).  All in all a fun time.
B004FOA84A|2.0|force closes a lot and controlling is not very good. it doesn't run very well on the Droid incredible. not a very good game at all.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I really want to play this game.... But EVERY TIME I try to open it, I get a message saying that the application has unexpectedly stopped working and I have to click the \\"Force Close\\" button.  Sometimes I get as far as the opening screen and sometimes it goes straight to the \\"unexpectedly stopped working\\" message.  It's frustrating!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The fact that they made this album in Dave Grohl's garage and recorded using analog tools just shows how much effort was put into this. Personally, I do enjoy albums made in the traditional style with tapes and all. Music wise, it took me awhile to be awed. Did not took to it on the 1st listen, felt disappointed on the 2nd and by the 3rd, i was confused. Was I suppose to like this? Gone are the hooks that I (or the millions out there) so enjoyed in earlier records with 'All my life', 'Everlong', 'My Hero' etc.     Try as I might, since it was the Foo Fighters, I could never give up on anything they'd put out. Not surprisingly, I started to be drawn to it, how wonderful it all felt. Like pieces of a puzzle falling into place.     When they said back then that it was their heaviest record, they weren't lying. Track by track it all flowed without a single filler in my opinion. As it turned out, each number had its own great melodies about it, making you want to scream along to the words as Dave belts them out in a way that only he does best. Not to mention the frantic strumming coming from all 3 guitars (Pat Smear included this time) just gives you the urge to break into an air guitar motion. Rhythm section, tight as usual, always the framework for any Foo Fighters song. Would easily make a great soundtrack for the summer.    This perhaps could be their Magnum Opus from the catalogue as it just keeps begging for more listens. Although We're only in April, it could easily be my favourite record of 2011.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This story needs to be a little darker. story line is not very well thought of. i was expecting a haunted house but was very disappointed.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|When I went to this movie I was dreading a long story of someone with a bad stammer.What I got instead was a movie that returns to the old days of quality and character so distinct and obvious that it need no special effects,no over acting,nothing but good old fashioned movie making to make a stunning statement about someones overcoming a devastating condition.Real humans faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges meeting them with hard work,grace,and dedication .The music was fantastic,the scenery and tableaus of the very first advent of communicating on a larger scale through the wireless were fabulous.The intersperal of his relationship with his brother ,and his fathers stentorian perfect voice for the time made it historically an important look back at a period in history too that was wracked with unimaginable eventual world events.This juxtaposition of history and humanity made it a film to me that should have swept more awards.Geoffrey Rushs splendid part was perhaps the most astounding supporting job I have ever seen and begs the question of why he was not a shoo in.Without him Colin Firth would not have had the vehicle that he did,as simple as that.Amazing to me too is that no one over did any of there parts .I don't think once (except perhaps his first attempt at public speaking which was painful to watch )did one feel that Mr, Firths portrayal strayed into the over acting maudlin display that would have been all to easy.Acting like this from this superb ensemble gives me hope that maybe we will start to see more in the way of quality that is so severely lacking in Hollywood and in general.PBS and many of the Jane Austen period pieces have touched on this humanity ,but on this scale one can only hope that more exceptional work is in the offing.I almost thought a movie of this transcendant quality couldn't be made any more and how pleased I am to see that it could be done.For that matter the look and costuming were superb ,why didn't it win this award too?.Anyhow, having played in over 95 motion pictures as a musician I have always loved film ,and wish I could say I had contributed to something this fine.However I am very pleased that it did so well and hpe that many more get to see it on Amazon on demand.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|If you want a BluRay to show off your system then look no further. From the moment I popped this in I knew  I was in for a ride. The audio and video quality on this disc are simply astounding, easily on par with Avatar. I saw this movie in the theater and had a mixed reaction. I enjoyed the movie but really wasn't much of a fan of the 3d. I couldn't wait to get it on BluRay though. I was never really a fan of the original Tron, I always thought it was a decent concept but very poorly executed. This is the movie they wish they could've made in the 80's. The action sequences are the real selling point of this movie and they deliver. The light cycle scene is going to be my go to demo material from now on. I really like the fact that the action is always easy to follow (transformers take note) you can always tell whats going on with no hint of quick cuts or shaky cam. The final scene in fact is just the opposite, almost ballet like in its steady pace.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie and the astonishing quality of the BluRay is icing on the cake.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|wow.......... all i got to say is that i love this product. the shipping was very fast, i got it in two days. the best thing of this product it helped me fix my Red ring of death and it is working like a charm thank you artic silver 5. I recommend all of you to buy this product.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|There used to be one top MA movie for me and that was Enter The Dragon. Sadly, that is now number three in my favorites, Ip Man and Ip Man 2 taking the top spots. Starring Donnie Yen, the marital arts in this movie are amazing, but so is the deep story, which reveals a lot about the study of MA, as well as the depth to which it is ingrained in Chinese culture. A brilliant, fun film with a great cast and some of the most amazing fight scenes ever.  The story continues from Ip Man, with the Master and his growing family now in Hong Kong where new challenges and problems await. A must for any MA fan.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Is there any other American band out there right now that have had the career that these guys have had? As far as I'm concerned, they reached Aerosmith status 3 albums ago. I've been a fan of their's since the first cd. If you think their albums are great, you should seek out the b-sides that they record.     How do they decide what sucks enough to merit just a measly b-side? Hard thing for me because, all of the stuff is great rock. Cover versions, live stuff, etc. Wasting Light continues in that same tradition.     THIS is what rock music is supposed to sound like, people! Not that over-produced garbage that it has become over the years. I think it's great that they've even recorded it Old School using tape. It only adds to the flavor of the songs here. Grohl and the boys have done it again. Welcome back, Pat Smear...

B003L0HZ5O|5.0|last year I didn't even knew that TBK exsisted, then I saw the video for Tighten Up and then I saw Next Girl, the next day I went to Best Buy and bought their album. Their videos are hilarious! This album does not disappoint, every track is amazing!! I especially love She's Long Gone, and Too Afraid to Love You.  I have every CD except for Rubber Factory.  If you love Blues and Rock, this is the love child : The Black Keys. Dan Auerbach voice is AMAZING!!! One day I will have to see them in concert. I mean, Dan plays his guitar in such an amazing way and Pat bangs the heck out his drums!!! (LOL) Love The Black Keys
B004FOA84A|5.0|first off, this is a great (free) game.  even if you spend a buck, its worth all hundred pennnies.<br />while it may be short and simple its the best &quot;myst&quot; style game out there.<br />i hope for a (longer) sequel and more but this game really is awesome.<br />i really wish there was a way to port myst to the android platform! i'd totally p0wn those games!  :-)<br />just buy it!

B0047Y17P2|4.0|I love Michael Connelly and will buy and read all of his books.  I enjoyed this one although it was too much courtroom and not enough character building.  The problem with pricing the ebooks so high is I am reluctant to experiment in choices as you might in a library.  How does this reluctance benefit Kindle long term.  Its a problem that Kindle is apparently unwilling to aknowledge. I would buy more if they were more reaonably priced.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a great documentary exposing the corruption and greed that has destroyed our once great nation. everyone should watch this film and i hope it makes you as angry as it makes me.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead is great TV show that has the production and feel of a film.  Definitely one of the best shows to come along in years.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great app obviously, however it has just stopped working two times now.  I have lost a lot of progress two times,  super upset. Won't play again till they fix that issue.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|The knife is very tough.  A little bigger than expected.  The sheath isn't my favorite.  I would like to see a very nice kydex sheath and micarta scale handle. I would buy it again.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|and it does it well. i only have one request. id like to be able to program recordings more like a dvr. other than that i like it
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Listen to almost any station from anywhere. My Mother-in-law will freak when she finds out that she can listen to the news channel in South Korea on her phone!
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This album is definitely different compared to other Within Temptation albums. This has more of a theme and sounds more like pop. But this album tells a story through the music and the lyrics, making it enjoyable.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|...until I downloaded it.<br /><br />I was surprised to find, quite literally, EVERY local station that I am even remotely interested in is on there, including an AM station that barely comes in on my actual radios that is the only one near me that does ESPN Radio.<br /><br />The App is pretty amazing.  Easy to use, works well, and for the most part sounds really good.  I did find one of my favorite local stations seemed to sound a bit off at first, but after a song or so it sounded pretty darn good.<br /><br />I also really like that you can record things and play them back whenever you want.  I will find that really useful for certain radio shows that I like to listen to but can't due to work or other obligations.  Now I can just record it and listen to it when I get a chance, or delete it later if I decide I don't want to listen to it.<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea how this App works...all I know is that it does, and it connects to an insane amount of channels for me.<br /><br />I love it, and highly recommend it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I have this running on a Droid R2-D2 (Droid 2) and I haven't had any of the force close issues that other users are apparently experiencing.<br /><br />I find the game to be interesting and fun.  I'm not very good at these types of games, mainly because I don't have much experience with them, but that hasn't stopped me from continuing to explore the mansion as best I can.<br /><br />I like the graphics and the music.  The challenges are interesting and for me a bit challenging, but again it may just be my experience that's holding me back.<br /><br />Overall, I like it quite a bit.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This so was great fun, even tho it was short. Looking forward to a sequel. It is quite easy. Remember to shut the door behind you. :)  Samsung fascinate.
B0035V35P8|3.0|This movie got great reviews, but it was sadistic.  Their clan leader was a sadistic murderous monster.  All the abuse he delivered on those young people was utterly demented.  The gore was over the top, totally sickening.  I could barely enjoy the movie. I wish it had been a different story line.  I enjoy a good action movie, but this was over the top for me.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app especially since its free for today.  Well worth the. 99 cents also.  Those of you complaining about some stations missing need to see if they are clear channel,.  If so you won't get them on this app.  You need iheart radio.  Would highly recommend this app.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I'd never heard of the author but read about the book being a free Kindle download and thought what's the harm. I was drawn in from the first digital page and tore through the somewhat short piece with stunning speed. I was mentally nodding and agreeing as I went, feeling more motivated then ever to get back to writing. This morning I bought the prequel, or original, or similar work by the same author and I'm hoping its as good as Do the Work. Sometimes I've wondered about the logic of giving away a book for free but in this case they got a sale on another book they never would have had so the strategy seems well founded. I would highly recommend Kindle owners download this one while it is free and if you don't have a Kindle, well its still worth the money if you're a writer.
0670022411|5.0|It was refreshing to read a good \\"Vampire/Witch\\" book that was not filled with teen-age angst.  I loved the pace of the book.  It kept me wondering what was going to happen next to the main characters.  I am eagerly awaiting the sequel.  I hope it comes soon.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app.   The selection is pretty thorough and the sound quality is much better than others I've tried.  I wish I knew about this earlier.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was incredibly fun but far too short! Graphics are nice for a phone game. It worked great on my Samsung Delve! I would like to see another longer game like this one.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Not sure yet but I couldn't find a way to set up a recording for a future time. Can only record something that is on now. Otherwise not much better than free one. Not sure why you record while listening. Only 4 stars because no timed recording.
B00000E2WH|5.0|I don't care what people may think of HvK as a person, mostly because if you think anything of him as a person it is probably based on incomplete knowledge and a lack of understanding history.  That aside, these recordings - a little short though the CD may be - are the finest recorded performances of these works on record, anywhere.  I think what the conductor understands here is a fine balance between immediacy and the ability to hold the listener in suspense, and the ability to use the Berlin Philharmonic to create majesty without losing the sparkle and magic of the genius of Sibelius.  I think the tempos are spot on, and the engineering on this set is classic DG.  What the sound lacks in bite (what you might hear on the Decca/Solti collaborations) it makes up for in sweetness - like silk.  What you end up here with are lyrical, musical readings of the pieces that are each and every one - an absolute gem.
B003UESJHE|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie yet, you may think it's a well acted movie about a guy who overcomes stuttering.  And you would be a little correct.  The way \\"Field of Dreams\\" was about baseball, and \\"Titanic\\" was about a ship that sank.<br /><br />Great Britain was an empire then, and the King was the ruler over countries scattered all over the globe.  Europe had survived the worst war with more casualties than the sum total of all previous wars up to that time.  Nobody was paying attention to Hitler, and in fact people in the British government thought he was a good guy in the beginning.  Then he started trying to take over the world.  The first person in line to succeed the King of England wanted to marry a three-timing American divorcee from Baltimore.  Would barely cause a stir these days, but back then it was a scandalous head turner, and the Church of England (of which the King of England is the head) was having none of it.  The Duke of York, Albert - the second in line of succession to the throne - stuttered.  And the \\"wireless\\" microphone and radio was on the upsurge.  Great Britain was the most powerful country in the world at that time.<br /><br />Capturing the epic drama on film and still preserving the personal drama was the biggest bio-pic achievement since \\"Gandhi.\\"  Saying this was well acted is the understatement of the year.  Without going on for eight paragraphs repeating what has already been said in other fine reviews, what is portrayed in the King's Speech is loyalty, friendship, and compassion beyond measure.  That alone would set this film apart from most of what was released last year.  I never understood England's fixation on the Queen Mother (Queen Elizabeth, portrayed beautifully by Helena Bonham Carter) until I saw this film.  Colin Firth turns in a finely nuanced performance, but it is the chemistry between him and Geoffrey Rush that make the film as successful as it is.  What makes the screenplay so good isn't just the fine writing, but the fact they discovered Lionel Logue's diary, letter between the real George VI and Logue, and a copy of the actual marked up speech that was used by the king at the climax of the film and incorporated all of that into the script.  They didn't just get it \\"kind of right\\"  They nailed it.<br /><br />If you like bio-pics, good history, or inspirational films, highly recommend.  The King's Speech is a result of impeccable craftsmanship and years of perseverance winning out over commercialism. And Lord knows, we can use all the inspiration we can get.  I can't wait to see what Tom Hooper is going to serve up next.<br /><br />On Blu-ray the film is pristine sharp, and clear.  The cinematography and picture composition really shine.  Plenty of extras.  A good commentary track, and a 'making of documentary,' and a fun question and answer session with the cast.  One of the better transfers I've seen on this medium.  Well worth the asking price.y discovered Lionel Logue's diary, letter between the real George VI and Logue, and a copy of the actual marked up speech that was used by the king at the climax of the film and incorporated all of that into the script.

0141182865|3.0|A Confederacy of Dunces was a book club pick. We have been reading a lot of new, recently published books, so we decided to go with something that fell into the \\"classic\\" category. I'm not sure this one is truly a \\"classic\\" , but it's been around for awhile and is definitely a book that certain people just absolutely love. I was not one of those people - at first.    I really struggled with this one at first. It's not particularly dense, but I found the story kind of dull and a little pointless. In fact, about 200 pages in, I put it down and didn't pick it up again for another two weeks (I used the excuse that I had a library book I needed to finish before the due date, despite the fact that this was a library book too. Self-serving logic? Yes, please.) However, with this month's book club looming, I gave it another go and finished it with a few days to spare.    When it comes to books, I usually go with my first reaction. If I'm not hooked after 50-100 pages, I'm probably not going to come back with a favorable review, if I even finish it (I don't force myself to finish books I'm not loving). A Confederacy of Dunces was different though. I wasn't quickly hooked and I didn't really like it that much after I had finished it. However, it turned out to be one of those books that I have a hard time leaving behind. I've been mulling the book over since I put it down (for the second and last time) and it's actually grown on me. Turns out A Confederacy of Dunces is like cheese or wine - gets a little better with time.    My take on the author's point: most people are pretty stupid and so wrapped up in their own pointless lives that they don't realize how stupid they are. This is not exactly a comforting thought - it's actually kind of harsh, even if it may not be far off the truth. However, instead of creating a depressing, sad book, Toole creates these peculiar characters and sets them down in these ridiculous scenes, but none of the characters realize how peculiar they are or how ridiculous their current situation is. And I came to realize that the aimlessness of the story I originally struggled with, underlined Toole's point.    I actually think this book would make a good movie - there is a lot of situational humor that would translate well to a visual medium and the story would support a great ensemble cast. Jack Black or Zach Galifianakis could play Ignatius, the obese, over-educated, self-important mama's boy. Myrna Minkoff, the sex-obsessed politico, could be played by Parker Posey. Ignatius' tired, possibly alcoholic mother, Irene, could be played by Carol Burnett.    In a nutshell: Originally, I gave this one 2.5 stars, but after some thought, it grew on me and I have bumped my original rating up to a 3.5.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I love games like this, especially with great graphics..please do a sequal or more similar games longer this time. It's fun trying to break your head to figure it out. Awsome Game- 5 Stars
B0000C3I6U|4.0|I think because of how old it is there really isn't an relevance to it except that knowing Arnold as a public figure makes this pretty entertaining.

B0032JTV6U|1.0|Well, I love Glee.  BUT the DVDs I received were malfunctioning.  The sound totally dies out on the second disc.  As well as the third, etc.  I've given up on them.  I am further disappointed that I was unable to contact the seller to get a refund.  If the seller reads this, please contact me about a refund.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|It's fun.  I like this wave, although this is a remake, of girl killers that seems to be starting.[[ASIN:B003KV3E2W Neighbor (Unrated Director's Cut)]] That movie has more gore but ISoYG had much more money.
B003UD7JEO|4.0|I felt kind of bad just seeing just one fan review for Nikita. I disagree with the other reviewer to the extent that I wouldn't describe the two female leads as strong, I'd describe them as absolutely LETHAL! My wife and I gave up watching some of the other CW fare, like Vampire Diaries. That's a series caught in an endless and boring loop. Maybe we're in the \\"Too-Long-In-The-Tooth\\" demographic to appreciate some of these programs, but Nikita is an exception. Having come of age during the Cold War, I like Nikita for the nice, old Spy vs. Spy/James Bondian feel, the 50s and 60s cloak 'n dagger stories, framed in new technology. It also has a bit of the 1940s noir feel, too. Both female characters are sympathetic and likable, as well as being fine athletes and potent martial artists. I was also pleased to see the \\"thing\\" between Nikita and Michael come to fruition. So many scripts drag out the love connection and sexual tension and never come to any conclusion. ABC's Castle looks like its going that direction with its principals. The writers seem to be developing the characters in Nikita, and that makes them fun to watch. They change, they grow. I only gave my review 4 stars because I didn't want to seem too gushy. It's a guy thing.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game but short, and the ending was rather lackluster. It was fun to explore though, and good graphics. It's a good game for kids and adults alike

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've always enjoyed Tina Fey's comedy and wit, but never really followed her body of work (e.g., I don't make a point of watching \\"30 Rock\\", but always seem to laugh whenever I happen to switch it on).  However, after reading Bossypants, I can now say with certainty that I am a Tina Fey fan.  Bossypants was a very light hearted, and hilarious recounting of her life from childhood through her early days doing Improv to her progression to SNL and 30 Rock.  Her self deprecating humor and anxieties are something most of us can relate to in some way, and make for a very enjoyable read in which you find yourself smiling or laughing out loud, and looking forward to the next time you can pick it back up to continue on to the next chapter.
1600247229|5.0|While I understand the frustration being vented by the e-book readers, you do have another option. I purchase many wonderful things from Amazon, but I would never pay money to read any book that I can get for free at my local library.  I subscribe to a service called \\"Wowbrary\\" that alerts me to all the new materials that the library has just ordered or received. I then have the opportunity to get on the waiting list for the item before most patrons even know it exists.  And yes, you can even read most books for free on your e-reader if you install software that links to your library.    I just finished reading \\"The Fifth Witness\\", on loan from my library, and I hope that the high number of one-star protest ratings do not scare off potential readers.  Whether you buy the book from Amazon, download it to an electronic device, or borrow it from your library - this is a fascinating story.  The complexity of the case made some parts of the story a little hard to digest, but the way he eventually tied it together made it all worthwhile.  So, please, you can keep Amazon in business and still support your local library.  Declining municipal budgets are forcing libraries to close all across the country.  Once they close, we may never get them back - and that is a tragedy that will resonate for generations to come.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|works just great. on Xoom.  You can get local and nationwide stations.  Also lets you know what's. being played.  Album art would look great on the Xoom.  And this fills the Xoom screen rather. than running in a tiny window.
0470913029|4.0|Dr. Loren Cordain has packed a lot of information into \\"The Paleo Diet\\" and makes a convincing argument for placing pasture-raised & wild animal products and non-starchy vegetables at the center of one's diet. There's a lot of serious science in the book, but the discussion was easy-to-follow rather than jargony.     Where I'm not so sure Dr. Cordain makes a convincing argument is for unlimited fruit consumption and the total exclusion of dairy products. I realize that many people are lactose intolerant and that industrial milk tends to contain hormones and antibiotics. But for those of Northern European heritage, our ancestors evolved lactose tolerance. It's one of the rare nutrition-related genetic changes since Paleolithic times. Mark Sisson in his [[ASIN:0982207700 The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy]] variation of Paleo allows for moderate dairy consumption by those who are lactose tolerant. Sisson also allows the moderate consumption of tempeh and the occasional serving of legumes, unlike Dr. Cordain.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My daughter and I went to see this movie at 9:45 at night.  We did not go out for anything during the entire movie.  Very inspirational.  We shed a few tears at times.  Very touching.  How can something so bad happen to someone so young and come out with such a great ending.  This girl made me look at life a little different. God really had a purpose for her!!
B004IJZFP4|5.0|I'm a huge Bolin fan and it is teasure to listen to this new release.  All songs are alternate takes and the outstanding tracks are Lotus and Crazed Fandango.  Long alternate versions with great jams.  All the tracks are awsome, and this is a must for any Bolinaholics out there.  Bolin firing on all cylinders, mayby a bit on the jazzy side in the Crazed Fandango jam, but some blistering solos heading your way.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was so fun but kinda difficult and too short. I had to use a walkthrough because I got stuck a few times but still, so so fun!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a handy compact little knife sharpener! I especially like the extended diamond sharpener for serrated blades. Its also handy for fish hooks. I highly recommend this high quality sharpener.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Much more stable than the Winamp radio I was attempting to use. I love that I can search by genre, because most of the genres I listen to aren't available where I live (for some strange reason there's no dubstep radio in Kansas). Thanks for the awesome app.
0307408833|5.0|What's up with all the bad reviews!  Have you whiners even tried any of the recipes in this book??    This book is fantastic!  All of my friends rave about the chocolate chip cookies and double chocolate chip cookies!! And also the Apple Cinnamon Toasties, Banana Bread!  These are just to name a few!  The double chocolate chip cookies i make, no one can even tell they are gluten-free or vegan, that's how good they are!!  And these have been tried and tested on people who consume dairy and egg products!    But I must admit, the first few times i made them, they didn't come out very good, because I did not pay careful enough attention to the ingredients, but now, practice makes perfect, and the real proof is when your friends just gulp them down and praise you like there's no tomorrow!!    So this is definitely a 5-star rating.  For all those who are thinking about buying this book, ignore the other lower star ratings, they are very misleading and I'm thinking, if they don't like this cookbook, is there actually a different cookbook of this type on the market that they will like?  I think not!    Happy baking!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Love it . these types of games made 90s gaming great myst, riven, shadow gate, all were like this across multiple plat forms. Pc ,3do, ps1, sega saturn.
B004FOA84A|4.0|this app works just fine on the thunderbolt. great graphics...it was a little challenging which made it fun, more rooms or more clues would have been nice. just very sad it ended so quickly. only took me 2 days of on and off playing to figure it out...that's the only reason it didn't get a 5 from me.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Thought this game was pretty fun. Entertained me at 25 years old for a good hour or so to play through it. No issues with my phone. Galaxy s fascinate. I recommend.  Play it thru and delete.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|Classic movie that looks great on Blu-ray.  Fans wont be disappointing (just overly critical people with no lives will be disappointed).
0981951252|3.0|If you are brand new to any self help, success oriented books or audio then this will be eye opening to you.  However, if you are an avid reader of such topics then you will find that this book/audio is basically a greatest hits of other people's work, some credited, but much plagiarized without acknowledgment.  The Slight Edge (where the entire premise is the compound effect) by Jeff Olsen, 212 The Extra degree and Pump Handles by Zig Ziglar are quoted verbatim without credit to the authors, and they all were created first. If you read Success Magazine (and you should) then you'll also hear a lot of references from past articles. This along with motivational quotes and stories make this book an excellent read. Original and groundbreaking? No.  Will it get you headed in the right direction? Only if you apply it.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This movie is very well made.  Perfect casting, excellent visuals, amazing score, great story.  It's simply a well made movie, and the effort from everyone involved shows.    Jeff Bridges makes this movie stand out with his performance(s).  Garrett Hedlund did an outstanding job, especially with how demanding the role was mentally and physically.  Olivia Wilde was cast perfectly in playing the naive, yet intelligent and capable character Quorra.    The visuals are amazing, and they stand on their own.  I'm someone who's easily put off by excessive CGI in movies (Indiana Jones 4 was terrible, the CGI brought it down even further), but Tron: Legacy is a movie where CGI actually helps make the movie, as it takes place in a digital world (Star Wars Episodes I - III however does not take place in a digital world, hence it looked bad, and the technology used to film those movies wasn't as advanced as it is today, just as an example of where I'm coming from).    The score was amazing.  When I found out it was Daft Punk who scored the music, I was taken back after realizing who they were.  I'm  not a fan of their other work, but I do have respect for them after hearing their work for this movie.  The music worked flawlessly with each scene, as it added to the emotional situation perfectly.    The story was perfect.  A touch of a Nazi Germany theme along with a father son story in the middle helped make this movie very much enjoyable.    I went into watching this movie for the first time expecting an excessively high level of quirkiness and lameness (I was not familiar with the Tron series before seeing this). I also expected that those who made this movie might have approached it as a money making project where I'd only see a \\"cookie cutter\\" like movie (Example: The Pirates of the Caribbean movies) - I'm very glad I was wrong, and I'm also glad that I gave this movie a chance; a well deserved/earned chance.    Finally - I'm accustomed to people making comments on reviews for DVDs/Blu-rays in stating that they only want a review of the product, the product being the format alone, not the actual film/story.  In response to anyone who is tempted to make such a comment (I know you're out there), this IS a review of the product, as I bought the movie, I didn't just buy a blu-ray.  But to make you happy, here's the reivew you're looking for - It looks really good on 3D Blu-ray...    ...end of line.

Only if you apply it. Would I recommend it first? No, pick up The Slight Edge or subscribe to Jim Rohn's newsletter (it's free) and start there, this book is more of a refresher course rather than one of the Masters.<br /><br />I could also do without the bragging about Mr. Hardy's accomplishments throughout, John Maxwell, Earl Nightingale, Earl Schaoff, Jim Rohn and all the greats don't do that stuff, they let their teachings speak for themselves or use examples of how other people succeeded from their guidance (which Hardy does at times) but Mr Hardy, repeatedly saying he became a millionaire in his early 20's adding in that he found the perfect wife (based on a 40 page list of requirements) can come across as immature, insecure and a bit anal.<br /><br />Again, this book has merit just don't get turned off by the ego, maybe it's excitement.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I initially expected.  I highly suggest anyone to watch this.  It's not about facebook, it's about the people who made it - which is a great story.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|This documentary is amazing. I watched it when it first aired on VH1 Classic commercial free. I couldn't walk away from the TV. I was captivated; I didn't even want to go outside for a smoke. There are all kinds of information in this documentary. Lots of concert footage and personal information for the band members. It starts from the very beginning of Dave's career. I'm talking all the way back before Nirvana. All of the band members get very personal as they talk about the journey with Foo Fighters. I just loved this documentary. If you are a Foo Fighters fan I would highly recommend getting this. I have pre-ordered it and can't wait to watch it again.<br /><br />Here is the synopsis from foofighters.com<br /><br />FOO FIGHTERS BACK AND FORTH chronicles the 16 year history of the Foo Fighters: from the band's very first songs created as cassette demos Dave Grohl recorded during his tenure as Nirvana's drummer, through its ascent to their Grammy-winning, multi-platinum, arena and stadium headlining status as one of the biggest rock bands on the planet.

0439023521|3.0|AFter reading dozens of reviewers promoting this book, I decided to give it a chance. Fathers and married men, such as myself, were giving it rave reviews, so I figured it couldn't be too juvenile. I was mistaken. As someone who enjoys post apocalyptic, man vs. society literature I was very disappointed by the end of this book, which makes me wish I never would have read it.    SPOILERS AHEAD>       My favorite books in this genre include Brave New World and The Island of Dr. Moreau, both of which were borrowed from heavily in this book. The difference, however, is that these books used a narrative to tell a bigger story with a deeper meaning and used original thought. The horror of people being turned into human-animal hybrids felt real and original in The Island of Dr. Moreau, whereas this revelation in Hunger Games seemed like an after though, with no foreshadowing before and no conclusion after. These hybrids literally come from nowhere for 2 chapters, and then disappear.     My biggest problem with the book is that it ends without real resolution. What happened to Peeta's defiant spirit against the Capitol? Why are all the supporting character from the first several chapters never reintroduced to the story? My guess is that this used to sell the rest of the series, but it makes this novel feel very incomplete.     Suzanne Collins successfully stole the brilliant, original ideas of at least half-dozen literary works of fiction, used a 16-year-old girl as protagonist, and contrived a pointless love triangle in order to sell books. Did it work? Absolutely. Will anyone care in a decade? Not likely.

B001J0J1DW|5.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of the popular Alan Parsons Project release is a treat for collectors and fans alike.  The mlps design itself is well assembled and unique in that the Egyptian symbol is in gold and raised font making it among the more attractive mlps releases that I've seen and I've seen many.  Also included is a 16-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese and another 12-page colour booklet containing an essay on the album by Classic Rock Magazine writer Jerry Ewing as well as Bonus Material Notes by Woolfson and Parsons themselves.  The bonus material by the way is special and certainly adds to the overall enjoyment of the album which isn't always the case with other releases.  The all important sound quality is also very good and although I personally prefer the \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" album overall \\"Eye In the Sky\\" is still pretty good and despite the fact that the title track is by far the best track here, \\"Old And Wise\\", \\"Psychobabble\\", \\"Step By Step\\" and \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned\\" are also very good.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are:<br /><br />11. Sirius (Demo)<br />12. Old And Wise - guide vocal<br />13. Any Other Day - demo<br />14. Silence And I - early vocal guide<br />15. The Naked Eye<br />16. Eye Pieces (Classical Naked Eye)<br /><br />Overall, this mlps release of \\"Eye In the Sky\\" is very well put together and taking into consideration the bonus tracks as well this has to be the best version of the album that is currently out there.  Great content, very good sound quality and very good mlps design makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey brought up on more than one occasion the mean things people say about her throughout the course of this book.  It makes me want to tiptoe around my review, because she gets it from all sides, and I don't want to be critical because I LOVE Tina Fey.<br /><br />That being said, this book had 5, 4 and 3 star moments for me.  I was expecting just a little bit more from her writing.  I know that she is a brilliant writer, but what I think I learned from reading this book is that being a brilliant screen writer, doesn't make you a brilliant book writer, and I'm OK with that.  She told some of the stories in a really funny way, but some of them just weren't all that interesting.  Which I found kind of surprising.<br /><br />Honestly, some of this material would be what I expect to see on an above average blog.<br /><br />There were MANY laugh out loud moments.  I think I read all of those on a plane, and I'd go back and read some of the passages a few times because they were so hilarious to me.  There were many snicker moments, and some dead air.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable read.  Not disappointing, just not what I was expecting.

1439107955|5.0|This book is an amazing tale by a writer with an intimate knowledge of what it means to be dying from, and living with cancer.   It's exhilarating, macabre, and frightening.   While reading this book, you will feel pessimistic and optimistic while you cry and laugh as you make your way through the battle to fight cancer even as science struggles to understand it.    It's a page-turner, and a strange bedfellow as you read late into the night.  Don't hesitate to buy this book.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|So I just got done reading about 10 reviews from the \\"1\\" star section. It's amazing that these people can take one thing that they see, base an entire opinion on it, and then write a review. I see a lot of whining...\\"Han shot first\\"...\\"1:33 format\\"...\\"There will be another release in six months, and I'll have to buy that\\"...    First off, it hasn't been released yet! Do you really think that amazon.com has all the answers? and knows all information? NO! For anybody to think that Lucas would release the Star Wars films in the best format that we have ever seen, and do it in fullscreen format? Come on. Obviously that was some sort of misinformation or typo. It just wouldn't make sense.    I can understand the people who want their untouched orignal films, to a degree...When Lucas revised the original Star Wars films back in 1997 with the \\"Special Editions\\", his primary goal was to prepare us for the prequels he had yet to release. With the advancement in technology, trying to fill a 30 year technological gap is a difficult task, even with the CGI that was available in 1997. Bringing an old film up to the standard of todays films, and trying to make it look seamless, is almost impossible. But, to the best of their ability, and also probably trying to predict the future of multimedia, Lucasfilm took a leap and cleaned up the films. Watching \\"A New Hope\\" on DVD, with an upscaled player almost looks as good as a bluray would. The picture is crisp, clean, bright...almost looks like it was shot less than 15 years ago, almost. For the audiophiles, we received a 5.1 Dolby surround mix. So who wouldn't want to view their precious Star Wars films in top notch quality? Well, apparently Han shot first.    Personally, I think the \\"Han shot first\\" complaint is the only legitimate alteration complaint of all three orignal films. What else can you really say ruins the films? There wasn't any other plot altering changes to the films. Everything else is just CGI alterations or recreations, panning the camera to left just to see what's walking around, making explosions look better, and making the films blend with \\"prequel\\" standards. But when I really think about it, does this one scene really change the experience of the ENTIRE film? Not really. I'm not happy with the change. But to trade off all of the enhancements that made the films better just for one stupid scene? I don't see the logic.    Making something future proof is next to impossible also. Somebody once said to me, \\"Don't buy bluray's if you already have the DVDs, next year there will be greenray\\" Well, buying things is what makes people happy, and it also makes an economy. Could Lucas re-release the box sets over and over? Yes, and he probably will. But so what? If you look at the DVD releases of the original films, there was 3 of them. A 2004 release was the first for DVD, 2006 which included the orignal uncut films, and another 2008 release which is just for marketing. Just because another release comes out, doesn't mean that you have to buy it, and it doesn't mean that it's any better than the last one.     So remember, Lucas is human too. He's made mistakes, and he'll probably make more. But if your not smarter than the corporates, you're not any better than they are.
B003NTMREM|2.0|About Torchwood Series::<br />Here in the USA (mid-USA anyway) Doctor Who has always been a show that I could recommend to families.. where the parents and Kids (and now my grandkids) can watch together and laugh at the old special effects and the jump at the new ones. I know of many Families who wouldn't be watching if Doctor Who had the crap of Torchwood going on!<br /><br />I really don't even want people know that I watched Torchwood! But I must WARN others!<br />I bought it cause Capt. Jack was on Doctor Who. I thought it would be clean (sheeesh!)<br /> When I got online and complained to someone in a WHO talk thread somewhere else...<br />They said it got \\"way better\\" in the \\"Children of the Earth\\" .. well ...<br />I guess.... \\"Way Better\\" is really subjective.  It did get better ... but not \\"WAY\\" better.<br />I needed a bath after watching!<br />I DELETED the whole lot of \\"Torchwood\\" from my Online Video Library<br /><br />I liked the fact that Gwen finally told her husband what she was doing and that he could share in the job!<br />That sharing cemented their relationship! I loved that part!<br /><br />Else - Torchwood was trash! If they bring Torchwood back CLEAN .. I will be a fan. You betcha!<br />Story line was pretty good take out the TRASH (Sexual content (both hetro & homo) & language though.<br />A little less gore would be good too!<br /><br />You can elude to raunchy withOUT really putting it in. I can fill in where there might be something with non-raunchy stuff. Kids wouldn't have the experience to do this. They would just see the story.<br /><br />I have a great imagination. Yeppers I do! HA!<br /><br />EDIT:: JULY 10, 2011<br />I just got done watching TORCHWOOD Season 4 Episode 1 \\"Miracle Day\\"<br />I gotta say I was really pleasantly surprised!!!<br />NO Explicit Sexual Content! Not too much swearing!! A little gore but it kind of fit cause you had to show people having really bad accidents that normally would have caused them to be killed instantly .... so it wasn't too much as to detract.<br />The characters were just trying to figure out what was happening on \\"Miracle Day\\" so things might change ....... time will tell.<br />OOOOHHHH I wonder what kind of bad alien is at the center of all this???  COOL!g to figure out what was happening on \\"Miracle Day\\" so things might change ....... time will tell.  OOOOHHHH I wonder what kind of bad alien is at the center of all this???  COOL!
B00005JLD4|4.0|This movie really makes you feel for the horrors that have been experienced by the Aborigones.    It starts by showing Aborginal families hunting and playing together close to an encampment where they receive rations from the Australian government.  Mr. Neville, the antagonist that has been placed in charge of all bi-racial aborigones by the government, orders the 3 children the movie focuses on to be taken from their families and sent to a Christian boarding school.  The children are torn from their mothers and taken over 1200 miles from their home in Jilalong.  The nuns at the boarding school quickly make it known to the children they are to assimilate to their beliefs including daily prayers and forbidding speaking in their native tongues.    The eldest child decides they must run away to reunite with their families.  They trek across the outback with a tracker on their tails along with Australian police looking for them.  They find help from strangers along the way who offer clothes and food but some are not as friendly as they initially seem.      This movie is just one example of indigenous tribes being persecuted against all over the world because their way of life or their values don't sync with what is considered by most to be normal.  Mr. Neville believes he is doing the right thing by removing these children from their families to be integrated into a Christian lifestyle so they can be bred with other white people and their offspring can have their aboriginal traits weeded out of them as if being aborginal is a bad thing.  Many of these aborigines became slaves and as one you see in the movie, is sexually abused by the man that has taken her in.  It is astonishing that these events ever happened but what is even more disturbing is that this behavior went on until 1970.  Obviously we still have alot to learn about equality and allowing people to live and believe how they wish.    I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that wishes to know more aboutindigenious peoples and the struggles they have endured.
B000000H6Y|4.0|This album is very good. It has two amazing songs (Black no 1 + Cristian Woman) and the other tracks are good with some exceptions. If you like very slow atmospheric metal /gothic songs then this is your album. Its not so good as October rust but similar to this
B002ZG99QS|3.0|It's not that Tron Legacy wasn't good, it's just that it could have been so much better.  The Tron character was reduced to a mere plot device that never fulfilled his promise.  The story line was so lame that I viewed the screenwriters as journeymen hacks heavily influenced by Star Wars and working under the micro-management of the Disney marketing department.    This movie was designed to be a transitional PRODUCT.  It brought the Tron movie franchise to an end by killing off the main characters and served as a come-on to attract the children of those who loved the original movie to the new video game and cartoon series.  I would love to see what a better writing team could have done with the opportunity to create this story.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|I bought this product from TV show a couple of years ago and I was very happy with it at that time.  That is why I bought Swivel Sweeper again through Amazon. This time, it totaly disappointed me. First, the charger is not working at all. I have to use my old charger to charge the battery!!! Second, the battery only can last 5 minutes, even though it was charged 8 hours!!! Third, when I use it, the cover shakes badly!!!     I don't know why Swivel Sweeper product's quality goes down so giant. It really waste my money.

I have been streaming radio from Poland and have them in my presets.  Stations like RMF FM, ESKA, ZET, Nawet internetowe stacije jak Polskie Radio Londyn, polska stacjia.  Stream local radio as well from your current location.  I have been using this for years and this has been by far the best approach out there.  It's also worth to note that if you have Roku you can download the application on there and get all your presets just as if on your phone. I can't say enough good things about this app.

0307454541|3.0|While the story was interesting, the book took too long to get moving and was too graphic for me. It will be awhile before I dig into the next installment in this series...if I ever do at all.
0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is different from any book I have ever read. Normally, this is not the \\"type\\" of literature that I would indulge in, especially since I have so little time for leisure reading as an adult student. But, Stieg Larsson has created a set of characters and plot that make it virtually impossible to put down. You will become so engrossed in the lives of the characters, especially Lisbeth, that you find yourself craving to know more and more about this intricate girl and the fascinating story that surrounds these characters. I am normally put-off by political and corporate dialogue, but this book totally changed my tune on that. It has opened up a whole new area of reading for me, and I can't wait to finish the next two in the series!
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I bought this product at the Apple Store.  Over the following 6 months, the device got progressively more finicky with the cord position to the point where it now will not work.  Waste of money.  Don't waste your money too.
0439023491|5.0|What a great book! A friend of mine said you have to read these books! I started with The Hunger Games and I liked that book so much I bought Catching Fire and Mocking Jay at the same time! As I was reading Catching Fire I kept saying this just can't get any better and it did! I highly recommend this trilogy by Suzanne Collins!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Usually I can tell from a pilot if I am going to be hooked on a show. Not with Haven. It had to grow on me. Emily Rose is perfect as ex-FBI agent Audrey Parker completely at home with nourishing the souls of the emotionally afflicted. The Troubles as they are called are activated by emotions and can leave a path of death and devastation. Lucas Bryant is great as Nathan, whose trouble is that he cannot feel anyone's touch - except Audrey's, and Eric Balfour is wonderful as Duke the local bad boy.<br /><br />Audrey first arrives in Haven to solve a murder, and ends up staying when she sees a photo of someone who could be her mother. Her FBI boss and the local Police Chief conspire to keep her in Haven, making her think it was her idea to leave the FBI and take a job on the police force.<br /><br />In the finale, threads throughout the first season are tied back to a jaw dropping cliff hanger (True Blood, Bones, and other series should take notes!)<br /><br />This is a great series to fall in love with. Filmed in Nova Scotia and Canada, the small town and coastlines are beautiful, and so is the acting. Every regular cast member and guest star perfectly fit their roles.
0439023513|5.0|I think this is one of the best books I have read in a long time. A friend recommended The Hunger Games and I liked this book so much, I purchased Catching Fire and MockingJay. I would definitely recommend this trilogy to any one who loves to read. Awesome book and awesome series. Suzanne Collins is truly a gifted writer!
B003Y5H53S|3.0|I expected more of Rango,.... but it's a good movie,... for those who know how to appreciate it.<br /><br />Good movie.<br />Good animation.<br />Good story.<br />Good lines.<br />Good music.<br />Good western.<br />Ok fun.<br /><br />I taught the storyline was good, but perhaps more for adults, then for kids. I think the western story is too complex for small kids. I even think there's so much in the story I'd probably need to watch it twice to get all the details.<br /><br />I liked the music.  Especially the one during the great chase, with lots of action.<br /><br />Watched it with my 6 year old son,.. he liked it,... I was somewhat concerned for some scenes, the shooting,... but he didn't mind. And seemed to enjoy all the action. I think a year earlier he would not have been able to watch through it. Apparently he can watch through more action-oriented movies now.
B0014BC3C2|4.0|This was a nice film and I actually cried by the end of it haha. I did get confused at the end as well, so can see this will take a second viewing, but I think I understood what happened. What amazes me is how arrogant people can be when they have way too much power. I mean, did they REALLy not think someone would come looking for Anwar when he doesn't come home!? Or they just didn't care since they had no one to answer to. It's so sad when this can happen to people and there is nothing you can do about it. I actually was thinking the Fatima character should die to teach her dad a lesson (putting the problems in his backyard).... look what happens. Aren't we so lucky to be nice and cozy in our beds at night in America?    Also, Anwar's character got on my nerves. Yes, yes he was being tortured, but sheesh stand up for yourself! He got an attitude with the American, but cried all the time with the Egyptian. I was waiting for him to spit in the interrogator's face, yell over and over he needed a lawyer, or barging answers for a phone call or SOMETHING. Then when he was given a chance he was so SLOW.
B00466HN6S|4.0|Fun movie. Certainly for kids. It's not in the category of \\"Despicle me\\" or \\"Toy Story-3\\" (or 1, or 2) but still lots of fun. In the beginning it has a bit of Willy Wonka feel to it, while more to the end, it leans more to Santa. But it's all Easter-bunny power (sorry for the chicks). I liked it better at the beginning, and the middle. Quite some surprise-jokes there. But somewhere before the end, I get the feeling, the makers suddenly realize they need to bring to movie to an end. From that point on everything gets very rushed and quick-paced and to me the movie looses some of it's magic at that point. But still we had lots of fun. Definitely a movie to watch with the (young) kids.

B004G600A4|5.0|This has to be one of the BEST animated movies I (we) have ever seen.  It was so incredibly funny that we would rewind it to all the parts that made us All LAUGH over and over and over again.  We saw it at the show and new we would HAVE to own it and as soon as I could pre-order, I did.  My daughter (10 yrs) was thrilled when it arrived (me too).  My husband actually sat through the whole movie with us, not quite as many times, but he also said he thought it was a very good movie.  I would HIGHLY recommend TANGLED!! to everyone!!  LOVE IT!!
0143105566|2.0|I read this book few years after putting it on my list. It was largely disappointing. Better than average portrait of some of the characters (especially the head of the office), sub-standard plot that the writer never succeeded in making it interesting until the last third of the book. It seems more fit for a short TV show.
0307276902|5.0|Sometime in the early 90's i was sitting in Harvard Square having coffee with author, Tim O'Brien. We were talking about his best seller, \\"The Things They Carried\\". I took a deep breath and asked him, \\"Is this book true?\\"<br /><br />He blew across the surface of his coffee and said to me, \\"None of that stuff happened,\\" Then a sip. \\"But it's all true.\\"<br /><br />Some of you are saying, \\"how can this be so?' but i ask you to indulge me- as i will again later- because Mr. O'Brien is considered one of today's finest American writer's. True can mean so very much and given the memoir- a true account of the authors own life- or portion thereof- from the authors perspective one can hardly expect the facts to be such as a primary and secondary source biography of Thomas Jefferson. Clinical fact and emotional fact are two different things. Let me show you:<br /><br />Think of one of the worst things that ever happened to you. For half of you this could well be your divorce. Some of you, the loss of a love one through death; some of you it could be the battler with a horrible disease. Regardless, pick it, stick with it and stay with me.<br /><br />If I asked you to write me a 5,000 word description of your last seven days living with your ex-spouse and then asked him/her to do the same, will you tell me that I will receive two identical documents? I should hope not, because were that the case, you could have saved the marriage, but the truth is that you won't tell the same story and neither of you will have lied. You've heard the clich&eacute;' \\"there are three sides to every story.\\" People with guilt believe that this means the truth, his lies and her lies (or any facsimile there-of) where what this clich&eacute;' means is that there are the base facts; not at all affected by human emotion. Then his story will be peppered by his past emotions, experiences and the tone of her voice. Her story will be peppered with memories of comments her mother made, or body image issues or some scene from a movie she saw years ago. No emotion stands alone and our recollection of events are not sterile and without other influences. So when writing a memoir such as \\"A Million Little pieces' not only did Mr. Frey write with the Tim O'Brien philosophy but he wrote based on how he remembered things.<br /><br />Regardless, i was so moved by this book that when 'THE CONTROVERSY\\" first began I said, \\"I just don't care.\\" And the, as a writer myself, I thought about the fifteen pages it would take for me to get to the truth about an event from myt childhood and how, after an hour of thinking, I was able to get to the very same truth by altering some of the events leading up to it I decided to do the latter. After all, if my goal is to get to the truth, does it matter what road I used to get there? some may say that it does, but if my point is to tell of how my grandmother was taken away by ambulance because she took an entire bottle of Seconal when I was in seventh grade does it matter that I had to behave bravely because I was babysitting for the first time and it was the daughter of the farm hand who had found my grandmother and how hard it was for me to control the lump in my throat because of the huge back story having to do with this farm hand or could I simply find another way to get to the lump in my throat without bringing in the entire story of the farm hand?<br /><br />I saved my readers fifteen pages and a lot of information that had little to no bearing on the plot and the importance of what I wanted to say came through just as beautifully. In fact, because I did not force my reader to read paragraph after paragraph of back story about the farm hands bizarre connection to my family the reader was STILL READING when it was time to get to the real truth.<br /><br />Mr. Frey, thank you for your brilliant and beautiful book. In regard to the controversial press let me offer this quote from Joyce Carol Oats: \\"The punishment for being a writer is literarycritics.\\"<br /><br />Hang in there, Mr. Frey. The rest of you:  read the book to discover the controversy; read the book because it is remarkably well written; read the book because I've given you plenty of reasons to do so; read the book because in a world full of hate it's nice to find some beauty. Don't let someone other than yourself decide for you.ook to discover the controversy; read the book because it is remarkably well written; read the book because I've given you plenty of reasons to do so; read the book because in a world full of hate it's nice to find some beauty.

B003XT8Y3K|5.0|As Grady Harp avers, this is stunning recital, one of the best tenor albums ever produced. In my opinion, no tenor since Jon Vickers and Franco Corelli has possessed a heroic instrument to equal this young German's. The voice, large and baritonal, is aboslutely unique, his musicianship is indivudual and compelling, his way with the text is that of a gifted actor --specific and insightful-- in short, this is the dramatic tenor we have been waiting for. But he is more: a dramatic tenor who is equally commanding in the spinto repertoire as well as a fine lieder singer. A truly great tenor has arrived.
076115678X|4.0|I'm about a quarter of the way through this book, and have enjoyed it, plus learned a lot so far. Much like her author event I attended, Lorraine Massey's book leads the reader through some \\"curly girl pep talk\\" (feeling good about your hair, rather than fighting it), some education about the scientific nature of curly hair (it's dry & needs lots of hydration), identifying your curl type, and then gets into the care and maintenance of curly hair. The book also includes chapters on coloring curly hair, caring for curly-headed children, caring for men's curls, and curly up-do's.<br /><br />Before reading this book, I believed I had always been pretty ok with my curls, and what they contribute to my personality. But upon reading the introductory chapters, and Massey's own history, I was surprised by the number of memories of elementary school angst that came back - of my mom always styling my hair for me on school picture days, so it would look \\"acceptable\\", of a schoolmate nicknaming me \\"Medusa\\" when we did a silhouette project in the 6th grade, of going to the hair stylist with picture after picture of cool hairstyles from magazines, only to hear, \\"Now, you know it won't look like this on you, right?\\"<br /><br />While I don't think I ever really hated my hair, I certainly didn't embrace it, and this book helped me recognize some moments from childhood for what they actually were - fighting my natural state. And, at the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I believe there's a life lesson there - you can fight your true nature all you want, but it's always going to be a fight, and will rarely turn out like the perfect scenario you envision. Better to embrace and nurture what gifts you have, and learn to enjoy them.<br /><br />Studying this, and starting to use the Massey's [[ASIN:B000QSDHPG DevaCurl]] hair products, has really changed how I treat and handle my hair. For example, I'm much gentler with it, use a lot more conditioner, and use a t-shirt to absorb the water after a shower. This book offers lots of concrete tips like those to help you better handle curls, without damaging them, or causing frizz (a lifelong bane for me!).<br /><br />The book includes many hair puns and is written in a very conversational tone, which may not appeal to everyone. But I found the information provided more than outweighed any eye-rolling on my part due to the writing.<br /><br />The DVD that came with the book was only so-so - it was helpful to see how Massey recommends washing curly hair in the shower, but that was about it. The home remedy recipes were ok, but she didn't show how to apply them, nor do I foresee myself using them. I would have liked to see more how-to on the up-do's and other hairstyles, too. The section on trimming your own hair also didn't work for me - looked like a long and tedious process to me, and one I don't anticipate trying myself.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book for any Curly Girls, or parents of curly-headed children.

006088732X|4.0|I read this book because my daughter and I watch (& love) the TV series on ABC Family. This is one of the few cases when the show is better than the book - the TV show does a great job of keeping things dramatic and suspenseful. Perhaps I didn't get as much out of the book because I had already seen the first season of the show, so I knew some of the \\"secrets\\" shared in this volume of the series. But even knowing the secrets didn't dramatically diminish my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />I liked some of the character development that just can't be communicated on screen - some of the background on each of the girls' characters, and how they viewed certain situations. I also liked that each chapter was told from a different girl's perspective, so you got a taste of each character's thoughts, while still moving the overall plot along.<br /><br />It's been a while since we watched season 1 of the show, but I believe the show stayed pretty true to the book, which is refreshing - quite different from the case of the differences between Charlaine Harris' [[ASIN:0441018238 Sookie Stackhouse]] books and HBO's [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood]] (though I {heart} both the books, and the show!). PLL-the-show revealed the same secrets for each girl, and even the text messages from \\"A\\" were the same, possibly verbatim.<br /><br />I intend to keep reading the Pretty Little Liars series - hopefully I'll get caught up with the show timeline, and read \\"ahead\\" - then I can judge more accurately how well the suspense keeps me hooked.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is a British montage of a film. Sentimental it is. Funny it also is. Even the porn' acting sequences are funny. Hugh Grant is very good as the British prime minister. His love interest is touching. The episodes with the US president capture, in my view, an opinion shared by many in UK. London comes out as a pleasant place to live. The script is authentic too, using language as it's normally spoken. Colin Firth captures this and the sentimental side of matters, with his Portuguese housekeeper. There is poignancy between Laura Linney's character and that of her mentally disabled brother. There are more vignettes including a sample of Rowan Atkinson's precise diction, during his fastidious wrapping of a Christmas present. All the disparate elements come together in the end. It is clever and if one needs a movie 'pick-me-up', this is one to watch. It's a delight!  Ian Hunter.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|Music is a big part of my life and far more important to me than playing games on my Android. I have been a fan of Tune-In Radio for nearly the entire time I have been an Android user. When I picked up an iPod Touch back around Christmas time, I was delighted to see a version for it, but found it strange and then cool that the iApp cost a buck, but also included a recording feature. I bought that and have used that feature extensively. When the Android version improved to include recording just recently, it was just a matter of time before I bought it, but Amazon beat me to the punch! Thank you! ...although I like the interface of the iApp version a little better because you can re-order stations, this is still my favorite Android app for entertainment.

B004U42OD8|3.0|Having considered myself a devotee of all things related to Animal Collective, I was thrilled to hear some advance tracks from Panda Bear's third solo album, \\"Person Pitch.\\" The 12 minute \\"Bros\\" was (and is) simply stunning to me. Panda Bear's voice had long been the honeyed chaser to Avey Tare's more manic delivery in Animal Collective, but here that beautiful yearning coo was the main focus of the music, mixed with washes of hazy synths and drifting in a hypnotically repetitive epic that owed as much to minimalist techno as to Brian Wilson and hippie jam bands. Perhaps most impressively, the sound of \\"Bros\\" was a significant departure in sound from anything anyone from the Collective had done previously, including Panda's own solo work. Surely, this was a sign that the AC spirit was going strong, and promised many more releases showcasing their restless experimentalism and constant evolution of sound.<br /><br />Alas, I was a bit disappointed with the proper release of Person Pitch. I belong to a minority of people who feel that PP would have been much more effective and impressive as an EP rather than as a full album. For me, \\"Take Pills,\\" \\"Bros,\\" \\"I'm Not,\\" and \\"Good Girl/Carrots\\" sound fantastic on their own, and are brought down by the surrounding tracks. I realize that this is heresy to some, but I found myself overdosing on the syrupy sweetness of the album as a whole. I enjoyed certain tracks, but waited anxiously for the next AC-related release to offer some nice contrast to Panda's Wall of Pet Sounds experiment.<br /><br />For the most part, AC's Strawberry Jam (released shortly after Person Pitch) did offer a new direction in sound (some a bit questionable to me, see review for details), although Panda's contributions were again sunny, Wilson-inspired numbers, somewhat reminiscent of PP. Then, 2009's Merriweather Post Pavilion demonstrated an embrace by the entire band of Panda's feel-good sugar time approach to music. Of course, I thought it sounded pleasant enough, but it became clear that my fearless heroes of experimental tribal music were starting to show signs of creative satiety. As critical praise for the band continued to increase, my hope in the old AC philosophy began to diminish. And, looking back, it all had started with Panda's Person Pitch.<br /><br />So now we have Panda's fourth solo outing, \\"Tomboy.\\" Panda has stated that he didn't want this to be a retread of Person Pitch, and there are indeed some differences, like using treated guitars and drums rather than samples for his arrangements. But let's not kid ourselves: these are very minor variations on the now-canonical PP sound: ethereal, meditative repetition with Panda's voice treated to sound like a drugged up Heavenly Host at the beach. Strong moments are to be found, for sure, such as the melancholy \\"Slow Motion\\" and the spacious \\"Scheherazade.\\" Like Person Pitch, though, this release would have been better presented as an EP of its most essential cuts. Listening to the whole album, its true moments of fragile beauty are bogged down not only by the less inspired tracks, but by the overload of droning ethereal sweetness that has come to be Panda's trademark.<br /><br />Compare this with his second album, \\"Young Prayer,\\" and notice how affecting and beautiful the stark arrangements and production can be. Also notice how different in sound that one is from \\"Person Pitch.\\"<br /><br />I realize that some people can't get enough of this canonical PP sound, but I just wish he'd try something else.<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll take the best songs from this one and enjoy a Tomboy EP, while waiting for another artist to fill the creative void that AC has decided to leave (currently, I'm hoping that Gang Gang Dance's new album will deliver).t it became clear that my fearless heroes of experimental tribal music were starting to show signs of creative satiety.

B003V6L94Q|5.0|When the song \\"Chicken Fried\\" came out on the radio I was not a huge fan. I did not know who sung it and did not care I would turn it every time I heard the music on the radio. Then \\"Whatever it is\\" came out and I really liked it but I did not know that it was the same people who sung \\"Chicken Fried.\\" Then \\"Toes\\" Love it. \\" Highway 20 ride\\" Love it. \\"As she's walking away\\" Love it. \\"Colder Weather\\" LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! Then for my B-day my boyfriend bought me this C.D. It does not have a lot of the songs like \\"Toes\\" and \\"Highway 20 Ride\\" because they are on the other C.D. the foundation but I LOVE this C.D.

B004SBX112|5.0|Seriously, as I write this review (for an awesome, ad-free game you should definitely buy), the number of 1 star reviews exceeds the number of 5 star reviews. This wouldn't be noteworthy except that the vast majority of bad reviews are whining about Amazon but not the game, complaining the game wasn't updated in the app store a full (oh my goodness!) 2 DAYS after its Android Market counterpart. The level of entitlement issues, impatience, stupidity, etc. demonstrated in these comments is beyond my understanding. These commenters seem to agree that the game is praiseworthy (with challenging, holiday-themed levels that are great for short bursts of play or long sessions just like the original) and somehow miss the fact that poor reviews on the app's page will do nothing but hurt the game's developers.

B000001FYZ|4.0|This album followed the FM/MTV ready album \\"Savage Amusement\\". Savage Amusement was a good album, it had a heavily produced vibe to it, lotsa compression, delays, etc. The production was \\"soaking wet\\" as they say. The Crazy World album is more like \\"Blackout\\". The guitars are turned up to 11, the drums are drivin', the bass is locked in. Klaus's vocals are amazing as ever.     When I first bought this album, the songs didn't hook me right away. Then I saw them in concert on the Crazy World Tour. They played about 6 songs off of this album and suddenly \\"I got it\\". The songs live were amazing and the best of their setlist. When I went back and listened to this album after seeing them in concert, I heard this album in a whole new way. I realized that this album is meant to be played LOUD. Crazy World to this day is maybe my favorite Scorpions album, I still listen to it frequently.

B003YBUSMW|3.0|I have been playing Forza for a few years (since Forza 2) and lately I had been getting fed up with the choppiness that came with using a joystick for steering, so I decided to look around for an XBOX360-compatible racing wheel. I remembered using a really nice Logitech force feedback wheel on the PC with Richard Burns Rally and have been chasing that gaming experience ever since. To my dismay, I found out Logitech isn't licensed to sell racing wheels for the 360, that the only (real) choices were the finicky (and expensive/hard to find) official XBOX racing wheel w/un-tunable force feeback, the super expensive Fanatic Porsche-licensed wheel, and this very basic MadCatz wireless wheel with no feedback at all. Needless to say, I couldn't justify spending more than $130 on a \\"toy\\", so I took my chances with this MadCatz wheel...     ...When it showed up, I was impressed with the build quality. The wheel has a nice weight/diameter/thickness to it with good rubber grips, and the pedals emulate standard auto pedals instead of being floor-mounted. The sequential stick shifter is a joke (in my opinion), the throw isn't straight forward and back (I), instead it's at an angle like / or \ depending on if you're shifting left or right handed, luckily the paddle shifters work well. The pedal mount assembly is nice and resists slipping on carpet, but the gas and brake pedals are too far apart. Also, I wish the brake pedal was stiffer than the throttle, but it's still stiff enough to modulate without anti-lock brakes. I expected the driving experience without any feedback to feel very numb, but the clock-spring in the steering wheel offers enough resistance to give a good (semi-arcade) feel. I have it mounted to a small writing desk in front of my couch, which is PERFECT, but I would assume the leg mounts (with nice rubber grips) would be enough to keep the wheel planted in your lap through the tight apexes.     Overall, I'd give this racing wheel a 3/5 or 7/10. It's obviously not up to Fanatic standards, but it's also not even half as expensive. If you play Forza or any other driving games, you need a wheel. If you can't justify spending an arm and a leg on gaming accessories, this is the wheel to get.   Pros:   -It's a racing wheel!  -It's XBOX licensed so the center X (dashboard) button still works.  -Controls work smoothly, no excessive dead spots or grittiness.  -Good design.  Cons:   -No feedback of any sort.    -Iffy stick sifter.  -Pedals are too far apart (requiring left-foot braking).
0316069485|3.0|Using the Michael Connelly Gold Standard, \\"The Reversal\\" was just okay for me.  I felt like it needed one more wrinkle, one more \\"reversal.\\"  The off-screen violence at the end left me flat.  The on-screen violence at the end left me feeling fizzled out, unsatisfied.  A little bit of Mickey Haller and a little bit of Harry Bosch left me wanting more of each. There are long courtroom scenes.  You have to buy the premise that a man being retried for a murder of a young girl would allowed to be released and, even though being tracked and monitored, would be able to slip away. The crime-scene rethinking and analysis, as always, is excellent and I kept thinking it would end up in a truly plot-changing reversal. Alas. Connelly gives Bosch and Haller each something to do and tag-team the work in this plot, but at times it felt forced.  If you are a Connelly completist, you'll have to read this anyway.  If you're not, I'd read one of the others, particularly any with Bosch, like \\"Lost Light\\" or \\"The Black Echo.\\"  For me, \\"The Reversal\\" felt a bit safe.

B003UESJHO|4.0|A great story is one where you have to watch the film so you don't miss the plot.  That is one reason that The Fighter works so well as a film.  Christian Bale is about as far removed from being Batman in this film.  His crazy eyed, crack addict is an amazing performance.  Mark Whalberg is also amazing as his brother who was one of the most underrated fighters of the last 25 years.  His inner struggle between wanting success and wanting to be loyal to his family but also feeling the need to succeed and seeing that his family may be what is holding him back.  His lack of an Oscar nomination was a vast crime.     Simply put this is a terrific and incredible movie.  I recommend it for anyone who is tired of the usual garbage we see at the movies.

B004LWZVZC|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I was very much looking forward to seeing 'The Conspirator' and even went out and purchased an audio book, 'The Assassin's Accomplice' , which I listened to before seeing the film. As a history buff, I find books about such memorable historical events as the Lincoln assassination quite fascinating. Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints, Director Robert Redford and his creative team were unable to focus on the meat and potatoes of the story: that is, the events leading up to the actual assassination itself. Instead, Redford has offered up a quickie montage of the conspirators' machinations, with the bulk of the film concentrating on the aftermath of President Lincoln's tragic demise--specifically the trial and execution of the principal actors in the assassination plot.<br /><br />What's missing in this by-the-numbers history is a sense of who the conspirators were--their personalities and the context of the times they lived in. Instead, the main protagonist is a defense attorney, Frederick Aiken, who defended Mary Surratt, a principal conspirator in the Lincoln assassination who also happened to be the first woman ever executed by the US government. Most of the film focuses on Aiken's anguish over his perception that Mary Surratt was not treated fairly by the government, especially in regards to the fact that she was tried in front of a military commission and not a civilian jury. Redford obviously wants us to draw a parallel between the events that occurred in 1865 and today's recent controversy over whether the 9/11 conspirators (and Gitmo detainees) should be classified as enemy combatants and tried before military tribunals. In Redford's analysis, the post-Civil War government (and particularly the military) are the bad guys. What Redford conveniently fails to point out, is that perhaps the greatest usurper of the Constitution at that time was Abraham Lincoln himself (as the President suspended Habeas corpus for the entire duration of the Civil War--abrogating the right of the courts to determine if the custodian of persons in detention has the lawful authority to keep said detainees behind bars).<br /><br />After the montage of the events leading up to the assassination, we get a few flashbacks during the trial dramatizing what went on before and after President Lincoln's murder. It was well established during the trial that Mary Surratt met with John Wilkes Booth on numerous occasions at her boarding house in Washington, D.C., and in the hands of a professional screenwriter, that relationship could have been fleshed out. But instead, we catch only fleeting glimpses of Booth and find out virtually nothing about him. By failing to show Booth's relationship with both Mary Surratt and her son, John, one gets the wrong impression that Mary was an innocent victim in this whole affair. The fact remains that the conspirators promoted the beliefs of the Confederacy, a cause infused with racism. Is it possible that Redford sugar coats Mary Surratt and her co-conspirators so that we don't come away with the impression that they are racists? (For example, Lewis Payne, the conspirator who almost stabbed Secretary of State Seward to death on the night of Lincoln's assassination, was arrested in Baltimore a few weeks before the assassination--Payne almost beat an African-American cleaning woman to death because, in his mind, she was getting 'too uppity'-why leave something like that out?)<br /><br />I have no objection to screenwriters playing fast and loose with history in order to enhance dramatic events. One such example in 'The Conspirator' is that Mary Surratt is shown during the film without the black veil which she wore at the trial, completely covering her face. Historically, Surratt only lifted the veil during the trial when called upon to identify herself before the Court. Dramatically it would not have worked in the film had her face remained covered , so I had no problem with the films' scenarists depicting Mary without her face covered. But I did have a big problem with the scene in which Mary admits to Aiken that she was aware of Booth's kidnapping plot (Booth's initial plan was to kidnap Lincoln and hold him for ransom). The fact is that Mary Surratt made no such admissions--she provided no explanations whatsoever as to her conduct before and after the assassination. Because she failed to provide any plausible explanation for her conduct and continuously denied any culpability, her attorneys were unable to mount a serious defense. By falsely suggesting that Mary Surratt admitted to an awareness of the Booth kidnapping plot, Redford can conveniently imply that she took some responsibility for her involvement with the conspirators, without having to admit any knowledge of or involvement in the actual assassination.<br /><br />Perhaps it would would have been a much better film had the films' scenarists made Louis Weichmann the protagonist, not Aiken. Weichmann, a Federal employee, was friends with Mary and John Surratt and was living at the boardinghouse at the time of the assassination. After the trial, and for the rest of his life, he was forced to defend himself from both southern sympathizers who held him responsible for Mary Surratt's death due to his testimony against her at the trial and those northerners who suspected he was part of the conspiracy with John Surratt.<br /><br />'The Conspirator' is not a complete lost cause. For one who wants to learn about the basics surrounding the Lincoln Assassination and the conspirator's trial, the film does a fair job in highlighting the principal events. What's more, there are some excellent performances here--especially Robin Wright as Mary, Tom Wilkinson as Reverdy Johnson (Mary's chief attorney) and Kevin Kline, who has a brief part as Lincoln's Secretary of War.<br /><br />Was she or wasn't she guilty? That's a question 'The Conspirator' manages to skirt almost entirely. The evidence suggests a strong circumstantial case against Mary Surratt. Her death sentence is another issue. But for Robert Redford, Surratt is a victim of government injustice and thus her actual guilt is of little concern.ts depicting Mary without her face covered.

159420229X|1.0|Someone with a financial stake in the book did a marketing blitz to several technical websites stating how this book would help you improve your own memory -- and one even stated that it would help you remember where you left your car keys (the author himself repeatedly states in the book that the techniques don't help you remember where your keys are -- and that after winning the contest he even forgot that he brought the car to the restaurant, let alone where he parked it.)<br /><br />Given the complete misrepresentation on the technical websites, I made the mistake of purchasing the book.<br /><br />The book is an easy read, even if the author occasionally gets repetitive. It talks about the history of memorization, the current pathetic state of memorization (with special digs against Americans), mentions the techniques used in just enough detail to whet your appetite but nothing more.<br /><br />The useful part of the book could be boiled down to 2 pages or less.<br /><br />One part of the book that definitely doesn't belong is where he rips into a \\"savant\\"; effectively exposing him as a fraud.  It leaves you the impression that the author would be the type to repeatedly kick a weaker kid -- but only after the kid was knocked to the ground by someone else.

I went through and edited it before I handed it over for them to browse independently. Great for pictures and little stories though- just don't want my boys growing up too soon.

0312600844|5.0|I respect all reviews that do and do not like Freedom. However, after reading many reviews, I think that this novel maybe one of those novels that will garner more attention in the next several decades...and don't get it twisted, but many novels like Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was not popular in its hayday, either.     For me, I think that Freedom is a work of genius, and this book deserves all the recognition it receives.     I agree with readers who have said that this book was difficult to get into. What I found difficult about the book was not comprehensibility of the novel--it was that Frazen portrayed his main protagonists as very flawed people--exposing their evil ugliness. I think that a part of me felt very uncomfortable with that because it reminded me of what Frank Pembelton in Homicide told Tim Bayliss, \\"Everyone has a dark side.\\" He also told him that he better get familiar with his dark side and accept and love it because your dark side is a PART OF WHO YOU ARE.     I think that the majority of us could argue that we see that throughout freedom. Competition drives people to do ugly things. If you, as an older person, recall in your younger days, think about the decisions you made in your life that we very negative. It is easy to judge Patty Berglund and look at how desperate depressive she is. She comes from a family that her parents really didn't give her attention or recognition. She gets raped, and her own father, who manipulates the entire situation so he and her mother can still have a connection with the rapist's family, is not on her side. Then, she becomes too smothery later with her son, Joey, because she wants him to epitomize, in some regards, the greatest lust of her life, Richard Katz. In a sea of confusion, depression, and self-pity, Patty is the easy target of judgment--for she betrays the one person who has loved her unconditionally--Walter Berglund--Richard Katz's best friend.     One would think that since Patty \\"choose\\" Walter, the Berglund/Emerson/Katz triangle would be over, but it isn't when Patty and Richard decide to do the inevitable and unthinkable. And because years later Richard finally decided that he wants to be with Patty and gets rejected, that this triangle was about was competition--competition of love, competition for sex, and competition for desire.     And this is one of the key ingredients that Franzen is extraordinary at. For Freedom shows us that Patty's, Walter's and Richard's triangle is beyond soap opera-like...it's more than that. For Freedom is about our feral desires and wants--and through that vicious desire that springs up in us...competition for attention and love, when not in control, becomes a hurt, spiteful evil...that we are willing to let our dark side plagues us so we can get what we want.     However, when Patty lets that dark side take over her life, she loses the one important person in her life--the person who has tried to love her unconditionally...and for her to realize that she truly loves him, she has to love him.     Franzen has written a dysfunctional epic; for some, I can understand that it was a waste of your reading time or time in general. For me, Freedom shows us that sanctuary and love come at a price...and sometimes, we are the ones who set a high price for it. Although I thought that the ending should have had the same consistent amount of detail, overall, I give Franzen an A. It is difficult to write a portrayal of people who secretly live ugly lives...and who cannot admit to themselves, in their younger days, that they have totally screwed themselves over. But, Franzen, allowed me to be immerse in his fictional world that the mistakes we make...we can either decide that they will make us stronger or fall.     If you want a meaty novel that is difficult to accept but will make you realize at the end that humanity is not a Disney's Cinderella ending, Freedom, by far, fits into that realm.
1878424114|4.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success    Object -referral we are constantly seeking the approval of others. Our thinking and our behavior are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore fear-based. In object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things.    When we experience the power of the self, there is an absence of fear; there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval or external power.    Through silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first law, the Law of Pure Potentiality. Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component to this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. You can start with; I won't judge anything, for the next hour, I will experience non-judgment. Then you can extend it gradually.    The true essence is beyond the ego. It is fearless: it is free: it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge. It is beneath no one, superior to no one.    When you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self; when you really understand your true nature; you will never feel guilty, fearful or insecure about money, or affluence, or fulfilling your desires, because you will realize that the essence of all material wealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality.    The more you give, the more you will receive. If, through the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given and will not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving.    It is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The intention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly proportional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart.    Practicing the Law of Giving is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if you want love,learn to give love; if you want attention. Learn to give attention etc....    The heart is intuitive; it's holistic, it's contextual, it's relational. It doesn't have a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer; the field of pure potentiality, pure knowledge, and infinite organizing power; and takes everything into account. At times it may not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and far more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.    You must first become consciously aware that your future is generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life.    When you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not reacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation. These are your feelings, and your feelings are not someone else's fault.    All problems contain the seeds of opportunity and this awareness allows you to take the moment and transform it to a better situation or thing.    Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you force the situation, the resistance will once increase. You don't want to stand rigid like a tall oak that cracks and collapses in the storm. Instead you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends with the storm and survives.    Attention energizes, and intention transforms. Whatever you put your attention on will grow stronger in your life. Whatever you take your attention away from will wither, disintegrate, and disappear. Intention, on the other hand, triggers transformation of energy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment.    Intention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is desire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most people is attention with attachment.     The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection, memory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement of thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is awareness, is real eternal.       If you have life-centered, present-moment awareness, then the imaginary obstacles; which are more then ninety percent of perceived obstacles; disintegrate and disappear. The remaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through one-pointed intention.     One-pointed intention means holding your attention to the intended outcome with such unbending purpose that you absolutely refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the focused quality of your attention.    Learn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire.    Everyone has a purpose in life... a unique gift or special talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of all goals.    While meditation is the most useful way of entering the domain of spirit, simply shifting your internal dialogue to \\"How can I help?\\" will also access the spirit, that domain of your awareness where you experience your universality.    Ask yourself, if money was no concern and you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do? If you would still do what you currently do, then you are in dharma, because you have passion for what you do; you are expressing your unique talents.    I try to list the information, I like the most out of the book.    Thanks Ralph

1878424505|5.0|Be Impeccable with Your Word    Speak with integrity.  Say only what you mean.  Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others.  Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.  Impeccable means \\"without sin\\" and a sin is something you do or believe that goes against yourself.  It means not speaking against yourself, to yourself or to others.  It means not rejecting yourself.  To be impeccable means to take responsibility for yourself, to not participate in \\"the blame game.\\"    Regarding the word, the rules of \\"action-reaction\\" apply.  What you put out energetically will return to you.  Proper use of the word creates proper use of energy, putting out love and gratitude perpetuates the same in the universe.  The converse is also true.      Impeccability starts at home.  Be impeccable with yourself and that will reflect in your life and your relationships with others.  This agreement can help change thousands of other agreements, especially ones that create fear instead of love.    Don't Take Anything Personally    Nothing others do is because of you.  What others say and do is a projection of their own dream.  When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.  We take things personally when we agree with what others have said.  If we didn't agree, the things that others say would not affect us emotionally.  If we did not care about what others think about us, their words or behavior could not affect us.    Even if someone yells at you, gossips about you, harms you or yours, it still is not about you!  Their actions and words are based on what they believe in their personal dream.     Our personal \\"Book of Law\\" and belief system makes us feel safe.  When people have beliefs that are different from our own, we get scared, defend ourselves, and impose our point of view on others.  If someone gets angry with us it is because our belief system is challenging their belief system and they get scared.  They need to defend their point of view.  Why become angry, create conflict, and expend energy arguing when you are aware of this?    Don't Make Assumptions    Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.  Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.  With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.  When we make assumptions it is because we believe we know what others are thinking and feeling.  We believe we know their point of view, their dream.  We forget that our beliefs are just our point of view based on our belief system and personal experiences and have nothing to do with what others think and feel.      We make the assumption that everybody judges us, abuses us, victimizes us, and blames us the way we do ourselves.  As a result we reject ourselves before others have the chance to reject us.  When we think this way, it becomes difficult to be ourselves in the world.    Take action and be clear to others about what you want or do not want; do not gossip and make assumptions about things others tell you.  Respect other points of view and avoid arguing just to be right.  Respect yourself and be honest with yourself.  Stop expecting the people around you to know what is in your head.    Always Do Your Best    Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.  Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.  Doing your best means enjoying the action without expecting a reward.  The pleasure comes from doing what you like in life and having fun, not from how much you get paid.  Enjoy the path traveled and the destination will take care of itself.    Living in the moment and releasing the past helps us to do the best we can in the moment.  It allows us to be fully alive right now, enjoying what is present, not worrying about the past or the future.    Have patience with yourself.  Take action.  Practice forgiveness.  If you do your best always, transformation will happen as a matter of course.    There is a few books that I think are life changing and this is one.    Life changing Books:  The Four Agreements  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind   TNT, the Power Within You. How to Release the Forces Inside You & Get What You Want!

B004XDYJRU|2.0|As I downloaded and installed this application yesterday, I wrote a glowing review. Mistake that was.<br /><br />The new pro version would not play ANY BBC radio station. It would buffer and buffer and then force close.<br /><br />I uninstalled the pro version (I really wanted to be able to record) and reinstalled my original version from my backup.(You do backup right?) and BBC played again.<br /><br />For giggles, I then reinstalled the pro version and tried again. Same results. Wouldn't play BBC. So my old, original I think version 1.5 is reinstalled and playing my favorite stations just fine!
B004I11VZ0|5.0|When I purchased Ip Man 2 I wasnt sure if it was going to be any good. I actually thought it was going the lesser of the 2 Ip man films. I stand corrected! This was an excellent sequel to the first! I got a glimpse of the table fight scene on You tube and was like \\"lame\\"! Far from the truth and was actually one of the best parts of the film, not to say the other fight scenes were lame (far from it). I highly recommend this film especially on Blu! Donnie Yen is amazing as usual and doesnt disappoint. Samo Hung was actually nice too. One of the coolest parts was at the end! Guess who comes by to take lessons in Wing Chung? LOL, what a nice way to end the film...fantastic!
B004UA8D1O|2.0|In the beginning I thought of giving it 1 star. It was so slow paced, I felt like watching another movie instead. But I did move further and further. Plot reminded me a little of other movies. Guys from expedition are trapped in a cave and almost no one survives. But to all that, here is a boy who's dad is a real walking nightmare. He doesn't know his dad as a person until they get trapped together. I must say the end made me think of giving it 3 stars. It was very sad and touching. But then it's only because the ending was sad I can't give the whole movie 3 stars. It is worth watching, but don't have high expectations from it.

B0006OBPTA|5.0|I saw this at my local dollar store for $8 so I got it. This is a deal. All 4 of the karate kid films on 3 discs. What is great is that there is several special features for the first one....but none for the others. Yeah they weren't as good but something.     Another problem I had was the third and forth film were on a double sided disc. They could've made a forth disc for the forth film....or put both films on one side. If there isn't any special features, there is plenty of room.     A pro is the price. For such a set, it's a deal. The karate kid was a classic that is still loved today. now the other films not so much but still enjoyable.    Buuy      Pros:-  -all 4 films included  -Special features for first movie  -the price    Cons:  -not one special feature on movies 2-4  -movies 3&4 are on a double sided disc
0670022411|2.0|This came highly recommend through the magazine Entertainment Weekly so I bought the Kindle version and was in the mood for a good Vampire/Witches type of story where to try to find out together the mysteries of being a Witch and a Vampire. I kept reading until I was probably half way through the book and nothing had really happened. Conversations go on way too long, dancing and horseback riding and still no clue into deciphering what what they were going to find out. I almost thought I was reading a Stephen King novel where you just keep wishing someone had edited about a hundred pages out of this book.

The author made me think long and hard about the concept of freedom and the price paid to obtain it.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|The best thing about this 112-minute, PG-13 rated Music/Drama/Redemption flick is that the audience will get to hear some pretty good country music. It seems like Hollywood can't seem to cool it with making more movies about all the music stars whose drug infested lifestyle destroys their careers and personal lives. Last year brought the world \\"Crazy Heart.\\" In 2005 \\"Walk the Line\\" was the best of this genre. In this year's version it's just not very believable probably because the heartbreak wasn't about an actual country or pop music heart breaker. This movie seemed designed to win Golden Globes and Oscars for its stars. It failed. The only really touching scene in the film involved a hospital concert for kids sick with cancer.

B004L49K20|5.0|As a lifelong fan, I owe it to people to say that I always gave them the benefit of the doubt. But ultimately, it came down to this:  afer a month, was I still listening to the CD?  Recently, the answer has been... not really.  For example, despite my enthusiasm for the reunion-enduced \\"Astronaut\\", I was pretty much reduced to 2 or 3 tracks after a month.  RCM wasn't any different.  But this album was different.  It began with Youtube search-and-play for the new tracks, and I was taken.  So I preordered the CD, but was expecting 5-track filler to not add much to the already critically favorably reviewed 9-track I-Tunes/web release.   I was mistaken.  I have burned it at home and work, and can't get enuf.  A track-by-track review makes no since others have done it.  But I will add a few items...  - Reviews that speak of \\"The Man Who Stole a Leopard\\" being about a man who stole a leopard should be dismissed immediately out of stupididty.  Uh, metafor anyone?!  - The best tracks on the album - IMHO - are the add'l tracks \\"Mediterranea\\" and \\"Too Bad...\\"  - The overload of synths does get to be a bit much, but mostly works.  - Dom Brown does a more-than-admirable job filling in on guitar.  He needs to be made a member asap.  - They need to work with Mark Ronson again.  - I have never seen a DD album garner so many favorable reviews.  Google \\"Duran Duran All You Need Is Now Reviews\\".  - I lent my wife the CD... over a month ago, and I do not have it back.  And now our 4-year-old boy asks if I can plan \\"Duran Duran\\" every day when I pick him and his younger brother up at Daycare.  No kidding!    In Short, if you were a 80s DD fan, u won't be disappointed.  And younger DD fans will be impressed as well.  This album works.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|My daughter found this DVD for me. I did not know the film existed.<br />Led Zeppelin, U2, and White Stripes together? Not quite, but nearly. Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White meet for some `talk' and a session. The result is enriched by clips of music by the 3 bands, plus some of their influences. Something like a United Nations of rock music. The 3 guitarists are from different countries (England, Ireland, and the US), and since they are also of 3 different `generations', they have slightly different stories to tell.<br />Page, of my generation, and one of the stars of my favorites Led Zeppelin (up on top together with the Stones), has most to tell in terms of rock history. I would have loved to see more Yardbirds here.<br />In comparison, The Edge has a shorter history, but a much more political one, with U2's exposure to the times of Irish terrorism and clashes with the British forces of order. The Edge is also the most technical one of the three.<br />White, the youngest, draws heavily on his blues roots, playing old records, and showing the simplicity of a basic approach (e.g. building a `guitar' with a coke bottle).<br /><br />The result? Ear candy for rock fans. Is it a good movie? No way. Too fragmented, too many snippets. It is like appetizers for main course, many of them. Can I give it less than 5 stars? No way. It is too much fun to let any dissatisfaction crawl in. Yes, it might have been done better. Imagine a 5 hours concert or clips of the 3 bands...<br />For me, Led Zeppelin is tops, and I like White Stripes very much, while U2 reaches me only sometimes. You see that there is no full balance here. And anyway, I don't do music reviews.

0316056863|5.0|Last weekend I had the great pleasure of listening to Tina Fey's book Bossypants read by the author herself.  Not only is the lady fantastically funny, she's also got something to say.  Plus, on the audiobook, she does the Sarah Palin parts in her Sarah Palin voice.  And, if you're anything like me, you'd be very interested in Fey's own take on the Palin phenomena and her role in it.  Fey isn't writing a straight memoir here.  The breakdown is something like this:<br /><br />46% Celebrity memoir<br />28% Essay collection<br />12% Feminist manifesto<br />9% Stand-up routine<br />5% Self-help manual<br /><br />She does cover the major highlights of her life (roots, family, education, career, marriage, motherhood, and miscellany) in a semi-chronological fashion.  The book is made up of two dozen or so short chapters, each an essay.  Some of the essays are very personal, such as a portrait of her father, or the tale of her disastrous honeymoon.  Others were about female empowerment, such as chapters on body image and the fact that women can be just as funny as men.<br /><br />Speaking of funny...  I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone that Tina Fey is hilarious.  I laughed out loud through this entire book.  I'm sure it was all the more amusing coming straight from her mouth.  (By the way, I was surprised to learn that she's not a half-bad mimic.  She does a passable take on Lorne Michaels, Alec Baldwin, Amy Poehler, and other recognizable friends she quotes within the text.)  While some chapters were incidentally funny, a handful of them were loosely disguised comedy bits.<br /><br />It was amusing the way she kept divorcing herself from celebrity.  She spoke about glamorous movies stars as though she hasn't made the lists of Hollywood's most beautiful and powerful.  Somehow she's retained an everywoman quality that leaves her relatable and approachable.  By the end of this slight book, I felt I knew a lot more about Fey.  I liked and respected her even more than I had going in.  And I was thoroughly entertained.  I can't ask more than that.entertained.  I can't ask more than that.
0517548232|5.0|Economics in One Lesson is essentially an introduction into the Austrian school of Economic thought. Hazlitt's now renowned treatise originally written in 1946 is lauded by Libertarian stalwarts Ron Paul, Peter Schiff and Lew Rockwell among others. While some of the examples provided in the text may be dated the book is as relevant today as it was when first written. Hazlitt, from a 1940's perspective, takes on many of today's most controversial issues such as government spending, taxes, minimum wage, balance of trade, unions and inflation.  In an era of big government, many of Hazlitt's economic lessons come as a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend Economics in One Lesson for those interested in learning about the Austrian School of economics and basic free market priciples.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I thought that this Harry Potter film was worth watching. The reasons why I think it was worth my time watching, is because I am so familiar with the story & background of Harry Potter & the characters in the story, that I could easily deal with the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of action in this movie. This Harry Potter film really showed me that Lord Voldemort is totally evil & the fact that Harry, Hermoine & Ron are overall on there own on what they have to do. Since the death of Dumbledore things have been really different for Harry, Hermoine & Ron. I don't think that just because it is a Harry Potter film doesn't necessarily mean the film has to be filled with tons of action. This film had a bunch of dialogue and plot in my opinion. There didn't have to be a ton of action in this movie for there to be a good story. Which this film did tell a good story. This film leads up to the final battle & I am alright with the way this film turned out.
0375850864|5.0|My son has a pretty good case of dyslexia.  That means that reading time is hard time for him. He feels unsuccessful, it irritates him.  So I read to him.

He could not wait to hear more, to figure out where the book was leading.  I loved reading it to him. Right now, my goal is to keep him interested in reading, and in books, and make it fun.  This hit the mark squarely.  The book is thoughful, thought provoking, and uses foreshadowing like there's no tomorrow so for a kid like my son, it's perfect.  Well done.
B004FOA84A|5.0|very short game, I wouldn't pay for it but had fun for free! game was easy, but not too easy. was a little too easy to accidentally close the game or end up on main menu.   worked perfectly on evo
B001HN694K|2.0|Tim Burton really needs a high-profile failure or two to bring him back to earth and get him to engage strong again; sadly, this movie didn't do that. It's an interesting-looking mess, but it's completely a mess, even by the standards of an Alice movie.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I can listen from anywhere and everywhere! AM and FM with or without ear buds. What more coulda anyone want. Thank goodness for the internet and all the creative people who make it outstanding :)
B0000A1HQP|5.0|This is the French original; it was later remade (badly) as [[ASIN:B004AV5GX6 Dinner for Schmucks]] in English. GAME is remarkably well-written and well-acted, and is staged almost like a play, with nearly the entire action taking place in one apartment. For anyone who can stand reading a movie -- or who speaks French -- it's well worth seeing; it's a great comedy with some real depth to it.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Okay, so the movie wasn't the greatest but I loved the TV show, I really enjoyed the first movie, and as a fan of Sex and the City, I did enjoy (not love) the 2nd movie too. So much of my and my friends lives and experiences (on a much lower budget) are reflected in the characters of SatC.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|It took me a little while to get into this book, but it didn't take long before I couldn't put it down.   Great characters, very funny and sad at the same time.  Lots of extreme personality types, but that makes the story what it is.
B00164KYV4|4.0|The movie really does portray scenarios many women go through. We need to learn the signs and understand sometimes he's just not that into us (no matter how much we wish otherwise).
B003EI2EH2|2.0|After reading this book, I was gung ho to start using some of the methods described.  Had I immediately reviewed the book, I would have given it 5 stars.  The language is straightforward, and the author does a great job of convincing the audience of his results.  The problem is, the results aren't translatable to everyone.  I worked the first few chapters of the book to a tee for 3 months.  At the end, I finally decided to try something different because the results were extremely insignificant.  I'm happy that the author found things that work well for him, but like most quick-fix type solutions, this book is more gimmick despite the empirical research employed.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Even adults can enjoy stories originally intended for kids/teens/young people. I love the HP series and have enjoyed all the movies (and own all the books). I have no kids so I can't make excuses for why I show up at the theater. Even my Mom loves HP and she's 74!
1400032717|4.0|I read this book almost a year ago, and I just came across it on a book club list.  When reminded of it, I took another look at it and thought it deserved a review.  The point-of-view is unique from anything else that I've read.  It quickly captivates the reader and brings him into this world.
0393338827|2.0|Mechanics = accurate    motives and who knew what = total BS      I am a lowly, non-ivy CPA in Tampa who saw this whole thing coming in early 2005 (which in retrospect was late).  So much so that my wife and I sold our home in June 2005 and moved into a rental while the whole thing collapsed.  Yes, the masses (including everyone in our family) thought that home values would continue to rise and maybe level off at worse.  But Wall Street knew.  The freakish quants hired by Wall Street from all over the world and the garden of Ivy filling the hallways of Wall Street ABSOLUTELY planned the entire scheme.  Motive?  Lots and lots and lots of money.  What else could it be?  Ah, maybe the power that comes along with lots and lots and lots of money!!!!    Lewis, I guess, has been brought in by the Wall Street thugs to write an \\"expose'\\" where the villains were, at worse, grossly negligent.  The sad truth is that these villains (lead by Goldman) are incredibly intelligent, calculating, opportunists who orchestrated the greatest ponzi scheme ever created.  And guess what...  they are all still on Wall Street (and Washington DC) getting ready for the next \\"inside job\\".    Hang on to your hats America, the ride is just starting!

B0006SSOHC|5.0|What a difference one film can make that would eventually spawn a popular and successful franchise known as 'Saw'. The myster built behind the Jigsaw murders was awesome. The film led you to believe who the killer was as the film went on until a huge twist hits you at the end. The ending will always be remembered and the film overall is a gem. Definitly a recommendation to any movie watcher of any genre.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Best season ever!!!!!! They've gone back to the old format b4 someone screwed it all up with the mellow-drama. And I LOVE the new girl shes fantastic!!!! I never thought i'd like anyone as much as Rose - but her character tops it.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|The last installment was different of sorts, especially the acting. But overall, the Hoffman/Jill storyline and Bobby's story worked well side-by-side. I wish Dr. Gordon and Jigsaw were featured more in the film, going back to their relationship after the bathroom trap. The ending scene was amazing even if it wasn't a surprise. In the end, Saw: the final chapter may not have satisfied everyone for the plot or gore, but at least it went out with a bang.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|Read it for my book club and found it really hard to get into.  After multiple starts, I finally got into it.  I found that it was difficult to read, I felt like I couldn't breath or reflect on the characters as there wasn't many chapter breaks or natural pauses in the book.  Maybe that's what the author intended - for the reader to feel like a character in the book, unable to breath and just going along with the story/life.  Undeniably, it is well written and connects well throughout.  I did push through and glad I finished it, but felt a loss at the end. I have mixed feelings about this book and not sure I'd recommend it to a friend.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|Saw III definitly drives off emotions as one's story of tragedy and hatred leads to his lesson of forgiveness. Jeff certainly cannot get over his son's tragedy and has been living off of revenge. The family falls apart that leads to his wife making a moral decision. Jigsaw returns as he is getting closer to his end and initiates a game that would lead to an ultimate revaltion for Amanda. Saw III is awesome and worth the watch.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I really liked the game, what I got to play of it. It started out OK, but then crashed, and after that would never start up again.  Crashtastic - because it would be fantastic if it didn't crash.

0743457900|5.0|This book is a masterpiece of writing. John Le Carre switches so effortlessly from the first person to third, that at the end of the novel one can actually 'see' the scenes in techni-color. Each character in the book is a work of fine filigree. The work stands head and shoulders above Tom Clancy's shameless thrillers and Forsyth's artless alliterations. The language is quaint in some places and delightfully clever in others. More than anything, the reader will enjoy the psychological excursions of the other, for e.g. such classics as, 'Reason as a means of existence, reason as a motive, or reason as way of thought. I can make my own damn reasons'. George Smiley is the very anti-thesis of James Bond, a fat, old, pedantic, cuckolded, forever bullied spy who wears ill fitting clothes, and perhaps balding. Jim Preadeux the old field man. Mendel,Haydon, Bland,Esterhase, Alleline, Control...the reader is guaranteed to hear the characters at the end of the read.   The novel mirrors the life of true life soviet mole Harold (Kim) Philby who turned MI6 inside out for twenty years until the early sixties. George Smiley uncharacteristically sacked and in retirement returns to Cambridge Circus (MI6) to hunt for a British mole. 'There are three or them and Alleline'. Bland, Esterhase and Haydon, spot the mole.  I particularly like a few quotes from the book, Roy Bland to Smiley; 'As a good capitalist I am sticking with the revolution, as a good socialist I am going where the money is, because if you cant beat it then spy on it. You scratch my conscience and I drive your Jag'. Smiley to himself; 'You pompous, bogus, unproductive featherhead Martindale'.  Enjoy. Seriously enjoy.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|While I didn't have a problem with film itself or its delivery from video hut, the posting on Amazon led me to believe that the film was english speaking with italian subtites,however the film did not have Italian, instead it came with French and Spanish subtitles. I was clearly disappointed. And gave the Video Hut an unjust rating, initially believing it was responsible for the misrepresenation, when in fact, the ad by Amazon, was in error. Therefore, my inital rating for Video Hut as the lowest star is changed to the highest star for their part in the the quality of the film and its delivery
006145205X|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Succinctly summarizes human history explaining why trade is crucial and how things are continually improving for all of humanity. A must read, especially for those brainwashed by the fear-mongering cable news networks and politicians into thinking all is doom and gloom.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This is a perfect movie. It's fun, has great acting, has a good fun story. Initially I was staying away from the movie because I never liked the other boring Sherlock Holmes movies and series. But I finally watched this and i loved it. It was witty and fun all while having great action involved. I'd recommend this to any movie fan who likes action with a little bit of comedy.
0140143505|5.0|Real letters.<br /><br />I miss old fashioned letters, perhaps especially now that we live in the age of email. There are so few real letters left now, and this little collection here is a gem. I was reminded of some old 'real' letters saved, having by now collected dust, left from my parent's generation, and from a time long gone by.<br /><br />Occasionally I stumble over collections of published letters in antique bookstores.<br />I found this by accident in my favorite corner book store. It is by Helene Hanff, and it's thin so it easily escapes your eye. Happy to learn that it has been reprinted by Penguin.<br />I was in stitches the moment I opened and began reading the first letter, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of them.<br />With book orders from Amazon now, the occasion for the letters will likely not be repeated. Helene was ordering used books from the book store in London.<br /><br />The collection covers letters exchanged between ordinary people living their separate and ordinary lives on two Continents; one, Helene, in America, a freelance writer, living alone in a small apartment in New York City, E 95th Street, and in England, the staff in an antique bookstore in London, on 84, Charing Cross Road, Marks & Co; mainly Frank signing the letters from Charing Cross Road. The period spans three decades, starting a few years after WW 2, in the period of austerity in England.<br />By now, I have read it several times. I also learned that it has become a cult classic. And it has even been turned into a movie.<br /><br />I found the book especially captivating because of its humanity and good humor. It brings the times and the people to life.<br />And the contrast of cultures can't help but to captivate; the no-nonsense prose of Helene, contrasted with the British polite formalities.<br />From Marks & Co to Helene: \\"Dear Madam; In reply to your letter of October 5th...  .\\" And a PS in Helene's reply letter: \\"I hope \\"madam\\" doesn't mean over there what it does here.\\"<br />The exchanges continue through the years, each one with book orders from Helene, and payments enclosed in the envelopes from Helene. And during rationing in London, there are food packages from Helene to friends at Marks & Co.<br />Sometime in the sixties, Frank dies unexpectedly. Sadly the two never get to meet in person.<br />In one of Helene's last letters: \\"The blessed man who sold me all these books died ... . If you happen to pass by 84 Charing Cross Road, kiss it for me? I owe it so much.\\" -- Review by Palle Jorgensen, April 2011..\\"<br />The exchanges continue through the years, each one with book orders from Helene, and payments enclosed in the envelopes from Helene.

0385732554|1.0|I decide I agree and share the same feelings with most of 1-star reviews. The book is on slow pace and colorless mode (like its community) until the last few chapters. The ending is stunning, but not in a good way. It is left uncleared of what actually happened to Jonas and Gabriel. In my perception, they died. The ending is sad and disturbing, even for adults like me. Defenitely not a book for children. I regret buying and reading this book. If you ask me, \\"Holes\\" is much worth reading and my recommendation.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Really fun game, and it looks great. Took me about thirty minutes or so. One or two challenging puzzles. Great job, would be five stars if it were a little longer. Make another one developer!
B004FOA84A|4.0|it was great fun. though not very long but still fun. I want another one or sequel. good good fun fun I don't know what else to say.
B0001ZMBV0|2.0|I bought this set based largely on the glowing reviews I read on here.  I have to wonder at the quality of their playback equipment.<br /><br />I am only familiar with the Stravinsky works from a vinyl recording years ago.  I remember the recording to have a warmer, smoother, soundstage.  Here, the remastering has developed a brightness and edge that is not wholely unpleasant or out-of-character for the two suites, but is not what I remember on my turntable.<br /><br />As to the rest of the recordings, there is a harshness and edge to the sound that I found really unpleasant; particularly with the brass section (was the trumpet section using rotary-valve trumpets).  I found the listening experience so negative, I listened to some more than once to be sure it wasn't the medium causing my negative reaction (headphones vs. speakers).  No, it was the same each time.  Didn't anybody notice, and found objectionable, the principle trumpet in the Bruckner 9th?  After all, those passages were not for trumpet solo.  He was so totally, glaringly, out-of-balance with the rest of the orchestra (not to mention the brass section); it was almost to the point of being obnoxious.  The Berlioz which should have a delicacy of touch and a smoothness and refinement but instead was played by the Chicago Symphony like the perverbial \\"bull in a china shop\\".  Regarding the Brahms 4th, I have a recording on Decca Gold with Max Rudolf conducting the \\"original\\" CSO on well-worn vinyl with much better sound then what is heard on this CD.<br /><br />I really need to hear the vinyl pressings of these to be sure that the problem wasn't the re-mastering process.  If it was the re-mastering, then the technician should have his union card revoked.  But, if it wasn't the re-mastering...<br /><br />I am surprised to say this but this is one ugly set.  I was going to buy Giulini's other American recordings on DG; I remember Giulini's Mahler 9th with Chicago on vinyl to be especially nice.  But after hearing these, I'm beginning to have doubts.<br /><br />I was going to give this set 1 star, but out of respect for Giulini, I'm giving it 2; and that is generous.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|How can you possibly go wrong with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp!!! This was a fantastic movie. I loved everything about it!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Awesome app worth a buck. It really makes you think and you need to pay attention to your surroundings for clues. I hope there will be a second one coming out.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|There is literally nothing new or worthwhile in this book. It is as if Ferriss cut and pasted the text from the first couple Google results for each topic, then threw in a couple examples from his incredibly atypical life as proof that &#34;you can do it too.&#34; The book is filled with tons of great ways to get hurt and obcess over unimportant detals, with one or two valid questions about popular attitudes, though without real answers. If you want to be distracted and left unfulfilled, use Google, instead of wasting cash on this drivel.
0316069884|5.0|I picked this book up from the library along with Foer's novel 'Extremely Lound and Incredibly Close' just out of curiosity. We've been vegetarians for a long time, but mostly for health reasons and just for preference. There was much revealed to me by this book that I had not realized before. This is an important read for those who want to be educated about what they eat and where it comes from. Very creatively organized and more entertaining than I thought it would be.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I am so HAPPY that I purchased this CD.  I think its the BEST Jennifer Hudson release to date.  It shows growth and development of the singer in so many ways.  Listening is very easy with her smooth vocals.  And the lyrics are incredible.  I was so excited about it, I passed it on to my co-workers to listen for themselves.  I highly recommend this CD.
1586487981|1.0|I recall the War on Poverty.<br />\\"Currently, we are spending more than $350 billion a year on 79 means-tested federal welfare programs. That's more than we spend on national defense. Theoretically, we could take that money and give $8,939 to every poor person in America, or $35,756 to a family of four. Since 1965 we have spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty, measured in 1992 constant dollars. Yet the poverty rate is higher today than it was the year the War on Poverty began.\\"
1936719010|4.0|This is a very quick book.  Some reviewers said it felt like an overview of another book.  I haven't read any of Pressfield's other books, but it did feel like we were hitting the high points.  (This is why I gave the book four and not five stars.)    That said, read this book!  It will only take your lunch hour, or a second cup of coffee in the morning.  I'm at the start of a big project and a big life change, and I found \\"Do the Work\\" enormously helpful.  I have some concrete ways of thinking about the obstacles to getting this new project done (or even started!). It also helped me to look at some of my prior accomplishments in a different, better light.      I'm very likely to pick up some other of Pressfield's books now (my husband is already a fan).
1926778103|3.0|No question about the artworks in the book. I only wished they were more selective with their stuffs so most of them could be printed bigger. The book itself is rather flimsy, the spine of my book had already torn off and some of the pages are falling off too...    Overall a good book to have if you like Joe Mad or Darksiders artwork...

B003NWS5AO|5.0|I bought this album just out of curiousity, not expecting much of it. Fortunately upon listening to the album I was blown away!!!!! It's so catchy without being pop and It literally will leave you in a joyous mood!!!!! I mainly listen to Heavy Metal but this is an album even I can enjoy for it's brilliant musicianship, great lyrics, and of course Robert Plant's voice.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|A lot of complaints that you'd have to read the book to know what's going on.     Despite that, I haven't enjoyed HP since the first three, numbers 4,5, and 6 didn't do much for me, and number 6 I just didn't like.     In the Deathly Hallows, the acting was better and the cinematography and graphics really set the mood. There was a certain amount of fun to knowing what was going on because I read the books at least a dozen times while those around me hadn't a clue.     Still, I wonder if the director figured there was no need for much clarification because most of us would've gotten the points of the movie through friends, or because they were betting many of us have read these books.    Either way, the omission of details to be explained made this movie better than some of the last HP movies. Somehow, in their omissions, they kept the movie simple and more sensible, and made this a much better film than the others. To this style, I say why not make more book-to-movie adaptations like this? If anything, it would inspire me, and others, to read.
6305161879|2.0|I know I will get lots of \\"unhelpful\\" votes for this, but I must say that this comedy did not work for me.  The characters are exaggerated, even offensive (well, not PC), and the situations are utterly outlandish if not grotesque (e.g. eating the neurotic stutterer's fish right out of the acquarium).  OK, the actors are all extremely good.  Alas, taken together, I just felt like I was wasting my time watching this, like it was too silly to believe.  What I mean is, it didn't click, my laughs were forced and rare, and I couldn't suspend my disbelief, but instead constantly felt like someone was making this up as they went along.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I rented the Blu-ray of \\"Secretariat\\" and have just finished watching it. The creators of this fine work of art treated their subject matter seriously. There was no slapstick comedy where it didn't belong; there was no silliness. Except for that golfing sequence.... It was a good movie experience.<br /><br />I watched only one of the special features, \\"Heart of a Champion,\\" and I found it just about as good as the regular feature, though it was only fifteen minutes long. It shows comments from the persons involved with the movie, and it has a good amount of footage of the real Secretariat, his races, and the real humans involved with him.<br /><br />When Secretariat was racing, I couldn't help noticing the publicity, but I wasn't interested in horseracing. Until watching this movie and its special-feature I didn't really know what this extraordinary creature was all about. Now I do.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the book by William Nack.

Great record, and sounds great on CD too!<br /><br />The \\"bonus track\\" is a bit flimsy; okay, it's a live version of one of the tracks on the album with no information on when and where it was from. Great. Maybe there's just nothing else in the vaults...
0375842209|5.0|Thie book was such a pleasant surprise.  It was listed at Young Adult fiction, which ordinarily would make me shy away from it.  However, I feel it's Harry Potter-esque in that it will appeal to all ages (there is absolutely NOTHING else Harry Potter like about it though!).  It is narrated by Death so from the first page, it grabs your attention.  I found myself speeding through the book because I just couldn't get enough of it.  In fact, when I finally got to the end of the book, I was mad at myself for going so fast and I re-read it, which I never do.  I also recommended it to my husband who is not a reader and he loved it.  I highly recommend this.  It's a unique twist on the often discussed theme of Nazi Germany.
B004FGN3WC|4.0|The egg version is fun although you can tell it's a bit of cheap plastic.  But the discs and the movies are excellent viewing and the extras really make it quite a nice package.
0439023513|4.0|I must say that I really enjoyed Suzanne Collins' trilogy.  I feel that anyone could see what was coming at about the mid-point of Mockingjay. I gave this a four because at the mid-point is about where Collins' writing starts to kind of flounder in my opinion. I had a sense that maybe she was struggling with tying it into a neat bow and so there are little fragments of Katniss's inner dialogue that remain incomplete to me.  While I was reading Catching Fire I felt that she had resolutely chosen Gale.  I was mad but I kept reading and hoping. Then, Prim and the parachute bomb, and Gale's connection to that are what finally forces Katniss to let go of Gale.  I must say that this was one of those \\"fragments\\" I mentioned, a little bit of a stretch and very disappointing.  It was apparent that Gale knew nothing of Coin's plan so although I am happy she winds up with Peeta, I hate that she \\"blames\\" Gale for Prim's death.  Unfair. Katniss is hard to LOVE because she doesn't do what you think she should do or react to situations the way you would expect her to but choosing Peeta is what redeems her in my eyes regardless of how she made her choice.

B003Y5H5L0|5.0|I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from Hanna before going in. I had only seen the trailer once and barely remembered what was shown. And, I saw this in the D-BOX section of the screening room, which means motion seats. I'd figured this movie was pretty exciting if it was gonna be shown in D-box.<br /><br />And, as a result, it was. This is definitely the best movie to be released so far this year. There's a lot of garbage floating out there like \\"Your Highness\\" and \\"Red Riding Hood\\". Finally, a movie that is equally as thought-provoking as it is action packed and thrilling.<br /><br />Hanna is a 14 year old girl, an assassin since a child. She lives with her father, Erik, in a hut in the woods, who has trained her to be an assassin, and has kept her in the woods from day one, after the murder of the mother. As the film starts, \\"the time is right\\"- Hanna is ready to see the outside world, and so Erik sends her on a mission to meet him in Berlin... and to help successfully get revenge on Marissa, an American intelligence agent bent on killing both Hanna and Erik.<br /><br />And that's all you need to know- because Hanna is a high-octane, gripping, and totally action-packed movie that, the less you knew about, the more you will enjoy it.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan is just insanely amazing as the titular character. I'll be honest, I liked her more than Chloe Moertz in Kick-Ass. I was not surprised to find out she did most of the action herself, because I swear, it was just a thrill to watch. Cate Blanchett is stunning, hilarious, and sexy in her role as Marissa- and her southern drawl is great!!!! I actually thought she did a fantastic job. But, the real show-stealer is Eric Bana. He was a total badass, his performance was just fantastic and he seemed really into it.<br /><br />In addition, the cinematography is great too. Gorgeous scenery and good camera work in the action scenes too- even the rather gimmicky upside down shots were great. The suspense is high throughout, there's a LOT of suspense, and the last 20 minutes are an intense nail biter, especially the twist ending.<br /><br />Oh, and in addition, if this is playing in a D-box theatre near you, see it. The motion seats just add to the intensity of the film.<br /><br />In short, do not miss this intense experience. It is by far the best movie to be released in 2011, and there is not a single dull moment!he last 20 minutes are an intense nail biter, especially the twist ending.    Oh, and in addition, if this is playing in a D-box theatre near you, see it. The motion seats just add to the intensity of the film.    In short, do not miss this intense experience. It is by far the best movie to be released in 2011, and there is not a single dull moment!

6305428352|4.0|This itemed was ordered for my DVD collection.  This is a fantastic movie and one of if not the best movie for Richard Dreyfuss.  For myself, my collection could not be complete without this movie.  My love of music and history are both completely satisfied with this movie.  The acting all round is very well done.  I'm a 56 year old man who can not get throught the speach that the \\"Governor\\" gives in the final scene without sheading a tear, usually several tears and going through several tissue also.  You should see it if you haven't and see again if you have, it's a wonderfully warm and at times intense travel through time.
0316017922|2.0|Anecdotal evidence is not statistical analysis. Correlation is not causation. Gladwell mixes all this up to the point where it is irritating in the extreme. Add the fact that the book has obvious errors (eg. Bill joy did not \\"rewrite\\" java, it was invented by James Gosling, I have no idea how this kind of stuff can pass fact checking). I usually finish a book I start, but this one was a bit much and I had to give up.

B000062XFG|4.0|Last Christmas, lacking even a single episode of the show on DVD, I asked for NextGen's complete third season as a gift. Not only was it markedly better than the previous two, it was my favorite of the whole series, and the first to really flex its muscles and demonstrate what the writers, actors, and even the set-designers could really do. It was, in short, the season that I thought of whenever NextGen came to mind; it seemed to encapsulate what was best about the show. So you can imagine my disappointment when I looked under the tree and saw...the first two seasons instead.<br /><br />I was not a huge fan of said seasons. In fact, in my review of Season One I accused the other reviewers of \\"grading it on a curve\\" with all those five-star reviews - ranking it not for what it was but what it eventually became. I took some abuse for this, but I didn't really regret saying it. Season One certainly has its moments, but on the whole it's awkward, silly and even - gasp! - kinda cheesy. And in fact Season Two has its share of that awkwardness, silliness and cheeseiness...but a lot less than I remembered. Though it was still clearly working out kinks and bugs endemic to all new shows, there is a lot here that works. But this was not readily apparent when I began watching.<br /><br />What I first noticed was that Riker had a beard, Gates McFadden's Dr. Beverly Crusher had been replaced by Diana Muldaur's Dr. Kate Pulaski, Worf was no longer wearing that crappy-looking 1969 era Klingon sash, several of the crewmembers had switched uniform colors, Whoopi Goldberg was tending bar, and Troi had much better hair. However, the first four episodes (\\"The Child\\", \\"Contagion\\", \\"The Dauphin\\" and \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\") were unimpressive. Not bad, just blah. They seemed to lack dramatic tension or any sense of pacing; instead of a story arc, things just happened, without urgency or plan, until the credits rolled. What's more, the ridiculous \\"Holodeck almost destroying the ship\\" plot device was still lurking about; that was nearly as aggravating as \\"Wesley's science project almost destroys the ship\\" maguffin. What's more, the annoying tendency of the writers to Bogart \\"Classic Trek\\" plots and then have the crew pretend as if \\"nothing like this has ever happened before\\" is still fully in place. \\"Where Silence Has Lease\\" rips off \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\" so thoroughly for the first 20 or so minutes it looks like a remake - there is even some dialogue repeated verbatim, yet the \\"hole in space\\" is still presented as a brand-new phenomenon. And Troi? Still stuck with stating the pathetically obvious. Okona is a mischievous rouge? Really? Didja figure that out before or after he shagged a 20something Teri Hatcher?<br /><br />Luckily things improved rather quickly. \\"The Emissary\\" continued the tradition, set in Season One, of the Klingon-based storylines being among the most interesting of the series. \\"The Icarus Factor\\", despite the \\"anbojitsu\\" silliness, gave Johnathan Frankes something heavy to deal with and fleshed out what had been a pretty superficial character. \\"Loud as a Whisper\\" was a very innovate story idea. \\"Pen Pals\\" presented a wicked moral dilemma and had some terrific sequences between Frakes and Patrick Stewart. \\"Manhunt\\", while ridiculous, was undeniably funny - Picard's discomfiture with Lawaxanna Troi is painfully entertaining.  My favorites, however, were as follows:<br /><br />\\"A Matter of Honor\\" was an instant classic. Having Riker serve as first mate on a Klingon ship was a terrific idea, one which allowed the writers to begin exploring Klingon culture, something they continued to do brilliantly throughout the rest of the series. The sub-plot involving the obnoxious Mordak (sp?) was also funny.<br /><br /> \\"Q Who?\\" was without a doubt a terrific episode, not merely because it introduced the Borg, but because its brutality, relentless pace and unexpected ending (Picard admitting to inadequacy!) made it stand out even among the bestNextGen stories. The slowly-building sense of dread, the feeling that Starfleet has finally bitten off more that it can ever chew, is really remarkable. Special kudos to John De Lancie, who played Q with unusual nastness and menace.<br /><br />The most evolved piece of work from the season, if not the most exciting, was probably \\"The Measure of a Man.\\" The performances, particularly of Stewart and Brent Spiner, were excellent. Instead of delivering a boilerplate coutroom drama in space, they tackled complex legal, moral and philosophical issues which, let's face it, are at the heart of what \\"Star Trek\\" was all about.<br /><br />So in the end, I'm very glad I got this as a gift. While I still maintain that the NextGen wasn't fully done baking until Season Three, there is more than enough good stuff here - including a great deal of DVD extras, some of which are very interesting -- to justify paying the extortionate price.nse of dread, the feeling that Starfleet has finally bitten off more that it can ever chew, is really remarkable.

B003XU75QG|5.0|This is an amazing album, but since the us version has a bonus track i'd rather buy that one. Beside of that this is a must have album. I give it 5 stars cause I totally love the whole album including the flawless artwork.

B001E45XT4|5.0|These headphones are really worth the price. It instantly responds to the Realtek HD effects and makes music sound very realistic. You can hear the very lows and the highs. It may be a little uncomfortable at first because they fit snugly, but you'll get used to it. They're made of durable hard plastic, so it'll last quite a while even when abused in a backpack or when traveling.    Best $25 I've ever dropped on a headset. :)
0385751060|5.0|The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is a devastating read.  Lets just put that out there now.  I am amazed how we as human beings can treat each other so poorly - be so mislead in what we think is right... it breaks my heart.  Time and time again you can read fictional stories like this (that may as well have been real) as well as true stories that you wish were fiction.<br /><br />I give John Boyne so much credit for writing this.  It is a hard story.  It is a maddening story.  I was just as impressed with the book as I was with the movie.  The innocence of Bruno is perfect as he meets daily with his friend and not understanding that Shmaul is in a concentration camp - or even what that would mean.<br /><br />What this book shows is a friendship that no fences can separate.  It is a heartbreakingly innocent story that could not have been told as well if the main character had been an adult.  It had to be a child... the innocence of childhood that makes this work.... and work well.<br /><br />The movie shocked me.... the book broke me.<br /><br />A POWERFUL read of historical fiction that will knock personal prejudices down to rubble.
1600595871|5.0|This is a great book with lots of information on many book forms. As a person who is interested in making and has made numerous books, I find this to be a valuable resource for my bookmaking library. It contains good color photos of the books and has step by step directions with hand drawn diagrams on the various structures. I would not hesitate to buy this book.

B004L79VUI|3.0|I was born too late to experience The Band in its prime during the late sixties. So, at age 14, I was completely unfamiliar with Robbie Robertson when his first solo album was released in 1987. However, I quickly took note of \\"Showdown At Big Sky\\" and \\"Somewhere Down The Crazy River\\", two videos that, believe it or not, were actually played on MTV and VH1 at the time. I liked \\"Robbie Robertson\\" so much I became a fan to this day, waiting eternally for each new release. I still am not a real fan of The Band, though.<br /><br />At age 67, Robbie Robertson faces the daunting task of remaining relevant in a youth driven culture. I wondered prior to listening to \\"How To Become Clairvoyant\\" or \\"HTBC\\" if I would like where Robertson is at this stage of his career. I knew he was working with Eric Clapton, who I like, but I've never been a huge fan of. I also knew he was working with Steve Winwood, who I really like. And then there is Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails who I also really like.<br /><br />Well, \\"HTBC\\" is Robertson getting back to \\"Storyville\\". It has that sound. There are no Native American rhythms here, no electronic beats from \\"Underworld\\". And, to be honest, the magic of \\"Robbie Roberston\\" and \\"Storyville\\" is missing too. Yes, friends and neighbors, what I feared was partially true, Robertson turns out a somewhat subdued and rather flat album. I know this is supposed to be autobiographical, but a person's autobiography isn't always compelling music. I like Robbie Robertson, but \\"HTBC\\" is hit and miss. It's not a complete letdown but it's not his best work either.<br /><br />The better tracks here are \\"Straight Down The Line\\", \\"When The Night Was Young\\", \\"He Don't Live Here No More\\", \\"She's Not Mine\\", \\"Axman\\" and \\"How To Become Clairvoyant\\". The two instrumentals, \\"Madame X\\" (with only light touches from Trent Reznor, who was completely underutilized on the album as a whole), and \\"Tango For Django\\" are pleasant but forgettable.<br /><br />\\"The Right Mistake\\", \\"This Is Where I Get Off\\", \\"Fear Of Falling\\" and \\"Won't Be Back\\" really slow the album's flow down to a crawl. And, again, the subject matter on this album is only partially interesting stuff.<br /><br />I suppose if Robertson released material every two or three years, I could be more forgiving here, but since it has been 13 years since \\"Contact From The Underworld Of Red Boy\\", this is underwhelming material. \\"HTBC\\" is my least favorite Robertson solo album.<br /><br />Here is how \\"HTBC\\" compares with Robertson's other material:<br /><br />1987 Robbie Robertson: Five Stars<br />1991 Storyville: Four Stars<br />1994 Music For The Native Americans: Five Stars<br />1998 Contact From The Underworld Of Red Boy: Four Stars<br />2011 How To Become Clairvoyant: Three and a Half StarsOf Falling\\" and \\"Won't Be Back\\" really slow the album's flow down to a crawl.

031261246X|4.0|Zero Day by Mark Russinovich popped up on my radar awhile back via one of the tech blogs I read.  Russinovich is a Microsoft Fellow deeply versed in the internals and security of Windows, and his first novel plays to his strengths.  Zero Day is a novel centered around suspicious computer viruses and rootkits that seem to point to a more ominous event on the horizon.  For those not familiar with the term, Zero Day refers to a computer exploit that is used in the wild before a company or developer knows the vulnerability exists.  Depending on the severity of the exploit, these can be quite dangerous as the vendor has to play catch-up to fix the problem, and by then the damage might already be inflicted on the users of the software.<br /><br />The story centers around a security expert, Jeff Aiken, who is called in to fix  a computer virus that infects a law firm.  The main server of the company died, and when rebooted, the system is wiped clean of everything, even the operating system.  Aiken quickly realizes this is not a garden-variety virus, and starts sifting through the scrambled mess on the drives to find clues to what it is and how to fix it.  Meanwhile, a colleague of his who works for Homeland Security, Daryl Haugen, is seeing similar patterns that point to an organized wide-scale computer virus attack targeted at the West.  When they touch bases to compare notes, they find that a single name, Superphreak, is a common thread in these early attacks.  Unless they can find this mystery hacker, there's little chance that the full scope of the attacks can be stopped or even contained.  Making it even more difficult, there are some powerful people and huge sums of money that are working hard to make sure the attacks go off as planned.<br /><br />Russinovich does a good job with his first novel.  As a technology geek, I quickly got immersed in the story and found it hard to put down.  The details and general settings ring true, and when you look at things like the Stuxnet worm, you realize that this particular novel isn't a huge stretch.  I also appreciated that Russinovich didn't try for a \\"and everything works out in the end\\" finish.  Our society is highly dependent on computers, and unfortunately security is often an illusion.  Even when security is a priority, it's nearly impossible to be 100% secure.  Zero Day plays out some of the resulting scenarios with sobering conclusions.<br /><br />Non-technical readers might find Zero Day a bit too heavy on the details, and could get bogged down a bit as a result.  But if you live and breathe technology, Zero Day is an enjoyable read that brings up some interesting \\"what if\\" questions.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedou realize that this particular novel isn't a huge stretch.

0316069353|5.0|I don't understand the mixed reviews for this book. I think it's Connelly's best--and I've read them all. Well-worked out with a credible ending with a surprise that you don't see coming but which is believable. Unlike so many books that have lame endings or finish with bizarre twists, this one holds your attention throughout and, like a fine wine, has a good finish. I look forward to the next one.    CGP
6304411448|5.0|I kept catching the end of this movie on cable, so ordered it and am quite delighted.  Characterizing this movie as a romantic comedy completely misses the mark, as it mixes several genres, its love story and comedic moments nowhere near the formulas implied by the rom-com label.<br /><br />First, after knowing about this movie for years, I am quite surprised that the \\"Benny and Joon\\" of the title are NOT Depp and Masterson as the central love story, but Aidan Quinn and Masterson as brother and sister.  The supporting cast is suprisingly packed with known talent - Julianne Moore, Oliver Platt, Dan Hedaya, Joe Grifasi, even William H, Macy and an unbilled cameo from Winona Ryder (who apparently was Depp's girlfriend at the time and originally approached for Joon).<br /><br />So why is this a story about Benny and Joon, not Sam and Joon?  As the script would have it, the much older brother Benjamin (\\"Benny\\") and his younger sister Juniper (\\"Joon\\") lost both parents in a car accident, and Benny raises Joon into adulthood.  This trauma seems insufficient to explain Joon's many symptoms, which include pyromania (setting fires), sudden rages, intolerance for loud sounds, talking to herself - a cornucopia of mental disturbances which socially isolate Joon and require regular medication and visits to a psychiatrist.  Not a typical heroine for a rom-com (contrast with the single symptom of the Sandler/Barrymore vehicle, \\"50 First Dates\\").<br /><br />Into this mix step Julianne Moore as Ruthie, a love interest for Benny, and Johnny Depp as Sam, a love interest for Joon.  Sam has his own eccentricities - an obsession with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies, illiteracy due to being kicked out of school as a class clown, and a taste for the unusual.<br /><br />So here come the mix of genres - a serious drama about whether to institutionalize Joon, a comedy featuring the clown-like behavior of Sam, and a little magic realism from its post-modern insistence on being a movie that features a character obsessed with movies (Sam eventually lands a job as a video clerk).<br /><br />The film is centered not on Sam and Joon, but on Benny and Joon - Benny is angry and trapped but concerned for his sister, Joon is scared and trapped and trying to grow up.  The magic of the movies - represented by Ruthie (a failed actress) and Sam (the soon-to-be video clerk) - enter their lives and transform them.<br /><br />I won't give too much away, but this movie stands up to repeated viewings, due to its strong cast, special score, and heart.  There is a comic moment near the very end of the movie - one we've seen in a dozen other movies before - and it is a sign of the movie's heart that we give it to them.  Actors love characters that grow - by the end of the movie, Benny and Joon have grown to become Benjamin and Juniper.<br /><br />Okay - I'm charmed by this sentimental and magical movie, by the gentle patience and restraint that Johnny Depp's character shows toward Mary Stuart Masterson's difficult character.  In a world that tends to push the marginalized towards insane behavior - see, for example, Debra Winger's character in \\"A Dangerous Woman\\" - this movie provides a happy ending.  I'm a cynical guy, but, despite its inherent tonal problems from trying to mix so many genres, the escape and fantasy provided by this 1993 oddity have made me a fan.ed with movies (Sam eventually lands a job as a video clerk).
