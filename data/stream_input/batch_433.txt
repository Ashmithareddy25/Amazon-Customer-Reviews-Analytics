B000286RNY|5.0|Shaolin Soccer is one of the cheesiest movies that I have ever seen.  But, that is what makes this movie so fun.  The story is fun, and the special effects and soccer moves are completely unbelievable because we are so used to the world we live in.  Shaolin Soccer is almost an escape from that world.  If you have ever dreamed that you could do super human things when playing a sport, Shaolin Soccer will definitely deliver.  This movie almost has a One Flew over the Cookoo's Nest assortment of characters.  There is relatively good character development for most of the main characters, and the \\"bad guys\\" are easy to hate.  The computer animated stuff is fun and the music is great.  Simply put, this movie is just fun to watch.      By the way, as a general rule, I do not watched the dubbed version of anything.  This review refers to the origonal chinese version.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I have just completed watching the three hour film and felt instantly compelled to view the reactions of fellow viewers.  To my dismay, there are many who seem to have missed even a vague understanding of its depth and meaning.   <br /> <br />I am not quite certain how to respond to this fact, so I won't.  What I will say is this:  This film is a reminder why we as a human race are so in need of stories.  Their transforming power, their capacity to relay truth and meaning to the intricate fiber of our souls; perhaps this is why Jesus Christ was so insistent on telling parables to his listeners. <br /> <br />It was this film, rather than the Passion of the Christ, which communicated such an astounding and violent reaction in me as to draw tears and physical quakes throughout my body.  How many films have done that?  For me, this is the first. <br /> <br />For this is, I believe, a Christ story.  The sweet, persistent, loving forgiveness of \\"Grace\\" amidst the self-righteous yet brutally sinful humans she is subjected to is a fairly direct parallel to the story of the Gospels.   <br /> <br />Yet there is one essential difference: the wrath this town so unquestioningly deserves, it reaps - making the forgiveness of Christ that much harder to accept.  We so rightly deserve justice, wrath, and vengeance.  It convicts us as humans of a sin so deep within us we hardly recognize it anymore.  Is \\"sin\\" even a term taken seriously today?  I don't often hear it mentioned in our political struggles or in our news of war in far-off places.   <br /> <br />There will be disagreement on this, but it deserves some diligent thought: if humankind could acknowledge this rotting sin which resides in every person, driving them to unimaginable cruelty, violence, and greed we would be a lot farther along in solving our major problems, rather than thinking up new social programs and financial solutions to bandage a gushing wound. <br /> <br />I'm not a minister or a fundamentalist Christian -I am a human being who responded in a very deep way to this work of art.  Von Trier has managed to convey a lesson about the deepest human questions we face here on earth.  These are the questions we must answer before we die.  Really, what else is there for us to do here?   <br /> <br />If you are bold enough to continue facing these questions, set aside three hours of time for yourself and you will come out an enlightened human being. <br /> <br />Von Trier deserves every ounce of praise thrown his way.  His Dogville is a moral masterpiece for the ages. <br /> <br />Let's just hope by the end of his trilogy, he will have learned these moral lessons himself.  I'll be the first in line for Part II.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Thank goodness the DVD release is the special edition.  They were improvements over the originals with the additions.  To revile the special editions is nothing more than a display of a childish tantrum.  Grow up.
0140177396|5.0|It's so interesting when you pick up classics and you're glued to it as much as modern day releases.  Guess why they're considered classics and this definitely is one.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and plot of this novella.  Perfect timing and weaving.  Great character development and awesome use of description and senses to pull the emotions right off the pages.  And his writing style is just superb.  I honestly hated coming to the end of this tale.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is an example of how religious subject matter SHOULD be treated on film, yet never is. <br /> <br />You will be compelled to examine your beliefs after seeing The Passion of the Christ whether for good or for ill. Great cinema never elicits a lukewarm response and this is above and beyond great cinema. Worth owning.
B000002GJH|5.0|Having been born late enough to pretty much completely miss the 'grunge' era, and having to suffer the horrific state of late 90's 'music', I only discovered Temple of the Dog last October. <br />Whoa. <br />This is an unbelieveable achievement. If this was a debut album rather than a one-off tribute, I'd say Temple of the Dog would be emblazoned on nearly everyone's mind by now. <br />It's too bad that the reason for this album is as tragic as it is. Mother Love Bone's resident genius, Andrew Wood, OD'd on heroin. <br />It seems wrong to take such delight in what is quite clearly Chris, Stone and Jeff mourning their good friend, but when an album contains such highlights as Call Me A Dog, Times of Trouble and Say Hello to Heaven, who can resist? <br />Of course, the track most people will buy the album for (myself included) is Hunger Strike, and this song more than lives up to whatever hype you've heard. A beautiful, haunting song, tender as only Chris' lyrics can be. The wonderful vocal harmonies Chris and Eddie serve up have to be heard to be believed. <br />This album is as touching as any rock album has ever been. Don't look at it as a grunge CD, or a rock CD, or even a eulogy to a late prodigy. Look at this as the work of art it truly is.
0783225857|5.0|The greatest of American films, and the greatest American hero (at least according to the voting of the American Film Institute). <br /> <br />I consider myself a fairly sophisticated film-goer, and I have to say that this is possibly my all-time favorite movie.  The performances are outstanding all around, and the story carries powerful, sincere messages that continue to resonate. <br /> <br />The message of tolerance has been covered here, but my favorite part of this film is the qualities that Anthony Peck's Atticus Finch displays as a father.  He is patient, engaged, and thoroughly loving.  The respect he shows for his own children is remarkable, and memorable.
B00000583F|4.0|Very \\"addictive\\" in a word. If a particularity the sabbath sound has is:addictive once you tested you cant live without listen any band with this influence at least once a week and Sleep is like an energetic bar with this ingredient that you need to consume in your regular meals , that heavy and slow riffs , followed then by a rythm section with a lot of bass and drums and a voice like out of this world and lirycs sometimes incomprehensible completes a style that many bands have adopted and remain loyal to it  <br />HM

B00005V1Y0|4.0|Baz Luhrmann made a splash with his sparkling musical \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" but before that film, he made a little splash with the colorful romantic dance film \\"Strictly Ballroom.\\" It lacks the polish of his later works, but romantics will love the ugly-duckling love story.<br /><br />Scott (Paul Mercurio) shatters a ballroom dancing contest when he suddenly breaks from routine and begins dancing his own exuberant steps. His mother (Pat Thompson) is shattered, and his diva dance partner (a very made-up Gia Carides) drops him for a champion. But Scott still wants to dance his own steps, not the rigidly prescribed ballroom dances -- even if it means he won't win.<br /><br />As he's dancing, plain Fran (Tara Morice) appears in the dance studio and begs Scott to take her as his partner -- she loved his dancing, and she wants to dance with him, even if they won't win. At first he refuses, but then he starts teaching her to dance at night. And despite the interference of potential partners and irate families, the two begin to fall in love -- and dance to set the floor on fire.<br /><br />The story is extremely simple, so much so that at times it starts repeating itself. Okay, we have the free-spirit-learns-to-be-true-to-himself, plus an ugly-duckling-falls-for-a-swan story. But it's the execution that is charming, full of color and fire and outstanding dancing. And its simplicity keeps it from feeling rushed, although the complications late in the film seem rather contrived.<br /><br />Luhrmann is known for his use of color and textured scenery, and it doesn't fail him here -- though some scenes are relatively bland, he throws in splashes of red and flashing lights, such as the giant Coke sign that flashes behind the dance partners. The ballroom competition is a spectacular opener. And the choreography is outstanding -- the actors exude sensuality and sexiness, mingled with a sort of worldly innocence.<br /><br />Paul Mercurio is an okay actor, but a spectacular dancer. It's impossible to see him dance (a mix of Latin dance, Riverdance, and breakdance) without feeling a thrill. Tara Morice, with less spectacular dancing, is excellent as the plain, awkward Fran. The secondary characters like diva dancer Liz and stage mother Shirley tend to be two-dimensional. The exception is Barry Otto as Scott's dad, who dances his own wild moves when no one is watching.<br /><br />\\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is a sweet, sensuous story about being true to oneself, about love, and about how \\"a life lived in fear is a life half lived.\\" A rough-edged gem.r.

B00005JMX6|5.0|Matthew Kidman ( Emile Hersch) is in his senior year of high school. His future is looking bright due to the fact that he was excepted into Georgetown University. Unfortunately, Matt's family does not have the money to send him, and he has to compete for a full scholarship based on moral fiber. Standing in the way of this, is the girl of his dreams in the form of a porn star named Danielle ( 24's Elisha Cuthbert)who has recently left the profession and moved in next door to housesit for her aunt that is away on vacation. Matt and Danielle soon hit it off and fall for each other instantly. However, Matt is forced to choose between his future and his girl, when Danielle's film producer Kelly ( Timothy Olyphant) comes calling to convince Danielle to remain in the adult film industry. <br /> <br />Going into this film, I was in the same boat as a lot of the people who are going to see The Girl Next Door. I figured that the movie would be your typical teen sex comedy. While the film does play out like a modern day version of the Tom Cruise film Risky Business, the laughs are non-stop, the story is extremely well done, and there is the perfect amount of sex and nudity to keep the film from going over the top. You are probably asking yourself what the perfect amount of nudity is. In my opinion, the perfect amount in a film like this, is enough to get the point across, without taking anything away from the story. After all, the movie is centered in the porn industry which may turn some people away. But, it actually turns out to be a very good film. It is also great when a movie makes you laugh, but it is even better when the story for the film keeps you involved. In fact, I would probably call The Girl Next Door, the best \\"dramedy\\" I have seen in awhile. The performances were top notch in this film as well.  <br /> <br />Overall, The Girl Next Door is an amazing movie. The great performances, non stop laughs, and incredible story are what make this movie one of my all timefavorites. The DVD itself is very cool. It is packed full of special features including a short film called \\"The Eli Experience\\" in which actor Chris Marquette goes to an actual adult film convention and plays his character Eli Brooks from the movie. He actually manages to convince people he is an adult film director. This is reason enough to buy the DVD. <br /> <br />A solid 5 stars...
B00003CXCT|1.0|Like another reviewer, my previous review was removed for reasons that will remain a mystery to me. I guess because I don't agree that this will be the best trilogy released on DVD or because I will not spend a red cent on this DVD. But here goes. I happen to like the trilogy as it originally was and I am not old enough to be a part of the \\"old generation\\". The add-ons will incorporate the abyssmal prequels with the old Star War movies. Incorporating in particular a younger Anakin \\"wraith\\" at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. To AVOID BEING CENSORED AGAIN, I will say that this is a GREAT FANTASTIC IDEA! This isn't a personal issue but alot reviewers seem to be abusing the privledge of writing a review as means of \\"firewalling\\" so, I want to be different and go ahead and say that I think George Lucas can do what he wants to his films, I as a consumer will have the right not to be taken in by it. I think it would've been nice to get a DVD of the original unedited version along with the edited version of the trilogy, then it would've made both parties (revisionists and old schoolers) happy. It would've made Lucas more moolah megabucks! But he didn't so I can live with that. I can live with not spending any money on this product. So for those people looking for the unedited versions of the original StarWars trilogy THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE DVD SET! Consider this before purchasing so you will not be disappointed!
B0002IU988|5.0|Good music written by good musicians.  You can't beet that these days.   <br />
B00005JN2X|5.0|I think this film overall was pretty good. Though there were some scenes like Fox getting pulled over by the cops with Cruise in the back seat. Why didn't his character simply speak up and say that he was being held hostage bascially by Vincent. Well I figure that his character (forgot his name) the cabbie thought that since Vincent was a professional killer that he could easily take out the two cops and then kill him as well so he lied. That being said I'll be picky again a say that the scene where they are in the jazz club was overly long but effective nontheless in firmly establishing Vincent as a professional and heartless killer. The death of the old jazz artist was unexpected and just plan cold. The scene with the cabbie's mom in the hospital was eerie. Vincent was sort of making it known to the cabbie that he knew where his mother was, someone he deeply cared about in case he was thinking about blowing his cover to the Fez or not cooperating. The way in which LA was filmed was absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack was jazzy and at times surreal with what was going on in the film. It sorta reminded me of NIGHT AT THE GOLDEN EAGLE.
B00005QGAX|4.0|After the release of \\"Thriller\\", which shot up to number one, took home so many trophies, became a staple on MTV, radio and clubs, and found it's way to more record collections than any album before, Jackson didn't rest on his laurels. He went back into the studio to record his next album, which he had high hopes for. Though it took five years for the next album to be released, it went on to have the typical high standards for a Jackson album, it just missed the mark barely. <br /> <br />\\"Bad\\" was released in 1987. Quincy Jones said him and Jackson wanted the next album to have a tougher sound. This involved getting rid of soulful/R and B sound that \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Thriller\\" had. This meant less dance-ready songs on the album. Instead, the album would have a more rock and hard sound to it, be more edgy. Also encompassed was syntheziers that sounded very right for the time. People were hungry for the next Jackson album, so many were excited when \\"Bad\\" hit the shelves. <br /> <br />By just looking at the album cover, you can tell this is a new style of Michael Jackson. His skin now light and white, he looks completely different from the black man who released the biggest album in 1982. Also, he is wearing a leather style jacket, showing that he isn't someone to mess with. Though that is pretty laughable, the album indeed is the most personal message from Michael Jackson to date. While \\"Off the Wall\\" is pretty much straight up good times and \\"Thriller\\" is a little darker, but still into the good times, \\"Bad\\" is edgy and personal. MJ wrote 9 of the 11 songs, six hit the top ten, with a record five hitting number one, though the total length of all of them together probably equaled the amount of time that the \\"Thriller\\" songs stayed number one or even the \\"Off the Wall\\" songs. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are pretty solid. The title track is a rocking number where Michael declares his new foundation (who's bad?) Originally scheduled as a duet with pop bad boy Prince, Rodgers backed out when the lyrics weren't up to his liking (Michael uses cleaner lyrics than his royal badness wanted). \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is probably my favorite track. It brings me back to the good times Michael that I enjoy. A very well made dance track. \\"Speed Demon\\" is filler all the way, so skip it over. \\"Liberian Girl\\" is a pretty cool sounding song that didn't become as big as it should have. \\"Just Good Friends\\" is cheesy and kind of stupid, more filler, so skip it as well. \\"Another Part of Me\\" is a song from the Captain EO ride at DisneyWorld (that has long been closed). It's kind of juvenile, so it's okay to listen to once in a while. I find \\"Man in the Mirror\\" preachy and insufferable, so I skip it, but some people like the song. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is my second favorite song on the album, a very rocking number with an awesome beat. \\"Dirty Diana\\" would work with some artists, but it just doesn't with Michael, a little too hard for his style. It feels almost like \\"Beat It\\" II, but definitely darker and harder. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is a well done love duet. It sounds a lot like \\"The Lady in my Life\\" off the \\"Thriller\\" album, which makes me question why this song hit number one and the one from \\"Thriller\\" wasn't even released as a single. \\"Leave Me Alone\\" confirms the new Michael: a paranoid man on the verge of insanity. For that reason, the song is hard for me to listen to.  <br /> <br />I'm a fan of MJ's older albums, so \\"Bad\\" is my third favorite out of the three Qunicy Jones albums. He doesn't seem as happy and enthusiastic on this one as he did before. Also, this album I feel contained a lot more filler than either one of his past two albums, which are pretty much press play and enjoy records. Finally, Jacksons weird grunts and groans become commonplace, and though I like the \\"shamons\\" and the \\"ows\\" like a true fan would, I find them to be a bit much on this album. I feel MJ worked himself too hard on this to top \\"Thriller\\", and fell short, just like every other album in history basically has. I like the fun, soulful/R & B MJ who wants to start the party and pack the club. I feel that completely missing (except for \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\") on \\"Bad\\". <br /> <br />\\"Bad\\" isn't bad by any means. It is for the most part a well done album. Unlike the other two past records, it hasn't aged quite as well due to the excessive use of late 80's music technology, but it still sounds pretty good to this date. If you're into the old school MJ, the R & B king of the club, then you might be disappointed by the excess rock and pop in \\"Bad\\". Others who like newer MJ will really enjoy this album. It depends on your tastes, but \\"Bad\\" doesn't appeal to as broad of an audience as \\"Thriller\\" or even \\"Off the Wall.\\" It sold 25 million copies, which is a tremendous feat, but nothing compared to the 50 million of \\"Thriller\\". Jackson wanted mainly complete control and a whole new sound after \\"Bad\\", so this would be the last album produced by Quincy Jones. It might not have ended on a bang, but Jones and Jackson set the stage for the next decade of MJ mania with \\"Bad\\".
B00004XQP4|2.0|Growing up on Green Day (they being the band that got me listening to music because \\"Dookie\\" was the first CD i ever bought) the last 10 years for me have been topsy turvey.  Insomniac ended up being an absolutely awesome follow up to the massive success of \\"dookie\\" (oddly enough my father, who'd dabbled in 70's southern rock and country music as his favorite music became a Green Day fan with Dookie and Insomniac sitting in his cd player all the time.) <br />  And then Green Day scored again, albeit somewhat less in my opinion with Nimrod, an all-around good cd, but with seemingly too much filler. So when the \\"minority\\" single came on the radio i was very excited to snag \\"Warning\\". I was absolutely stunned at how Green Day completely hit the backburner as far as songwriting and performance of it goes. \\"warning\\" got three or four listens in my cd player before it become a \\"dust collecter\\" in my cd collection.  <br />  Then a year or so after buying it, i got into the classic (and one of the greatest rock groups ever) The Kinks - who green day did a cover of Tired of Waiting which is available on shenanigans.  And lo and behold on the Kinks song \\"picture book\\" which is the third song on the \\"village green preservation society\\" i hear the exact same riff of Green Day's song \\"warning\\" only two notes were different. I was shocked. I mean i know punk is all about ripping off the same three chords, but not a full blown \\"musical scale that is the basis for a classic rock song\\" it was such a blatant rip off that i quit listening to green day completely...however... <br /> <br />  Their new album, \\"american idiot\\" is going to be their best, i've managed to hear about half of it so far, and i must say it will be a milestone in green day's career, if it doesn't overshadow \\"Dookie\\" i'll be very surprised. So do yourself a favor, buy American Idiot and skip \\"warning\\" , otherwise i'd only recommend this album for completists (shenanigans can also be added to that pile cause they forgot to put J.A.R. on it) <br />Green Day will return!
B000002X2B|5.0|Never heard of \\"Blows against the empire?\\"  Paul Kantner's ambitious concept album opened to mixed reviews in 1970, and it remains an underappreciated gem today. The album's problem is simply a case of bad timing.  At the start of the seventies, the San Francisco counterculture was in trouble: internal divisions were breaking up the youth movement, the political successes of California governor Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon proved that the New Left was not as powerful as they thought, and musical tastes were drifting away from the \\"flower power\\" rock that had shaped a generation.  The album's central premise, of hippies stealing a starship and leaving earth for an interstellar utopia, would have been a huge hit just a few years earlier, but it rang stale and  bitter to many ears, earning harsh reviews from the likes of Rolling Stone Magazine. Nowadays, with the turmoil of the sixties far behind, this album can be fully appreciated for what it is: a remarkable stew of folk and rock, crafted  through the collective effort of some of Calfornia's top musicians.  CSN fans will appreciate the contributions of David Crosby, and Grateful Dead members Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzman all appear.  The liner notes are very insightful, although it would have been helpful to  have complete documentation on all the performers on each track.  All in all, this is psychedelic rock at its best!
B00005JN2X|2.0|This movie looked like it would be one of the good ones this summer: with Tom Cruise and Mark Ruffalo I expected something fun to watch.  This was neither intelligent (the character development was lengthy *and* flimsy, making the talking-head scenes boring) nor exciting (with the exception of a few sequences near the end).  Most of the plot didn't make sense, the writing was generally dull with only a few good moments, and the contortions that Tom Cruise pulled his face into in attempts to look evil were actually laughable.  More ambitious than a regular action film, but not more intelligent, so the mediocrity just becomes more noticeable.
B000068FUS|5.0|I'm gonna go out on a limb here and call \\"Southern Rock Opera\\" the greatest rock opera of all time.  Certainly it is the most successful in accomplishing what it sets out to do.  It never becomes bogged down in the concept of a fictional band called Betamax Guillotine's rise and (tragic) fall - it is so much more.  The first disc (Act I) functions more as an observation on the modern day south and people's misinformed views about it.  And of course, there's a lot of talk about Skynyrd, who the fictional band is meant to represent.  While all this might sound, well, dumb to most of us Yankees up here in the northeast, I know this album opened MY eyes up to the misconceptions that are so common about the south.  Of course it probably helps that I've always had a soft spot for southern rock.  Likewise, people with a strong disposition against Southern rock probably will despise this record.  But they're missing out.   <br /> <br /> <br />I can honestly say I've never listened to an album like this.  And I've listened to a lot of albums.  It's part sermon, part storytelling, part history, part soul.  Patterson Hood writes and sings most of the songs here, and once again his songs are characterized by his rednecky yet intelligent lyrics and his sublime smoke ravaged voice.  Mike Cooley also contributes some fine songs, especially \\"Zip City\\" which may very well be my favorite track on the record (does his voice remind anyone else of Jay Farrar?).  DBT went with a 3 guitar lineup this time around (like Skynyrd) and the result is some of the most scorching guitar jams since, well...Freebird!  Even some of the more filler-ish songs (of which there are surprisingly few for a double CD) are rescued by the sheer power of the 3 guitar attack.  By the time Act II gets well underway, the tragedy of Skynyrd finally starts to unfold, and the final track, \\"Angels and Fuselage\\", has to be one of the most effective album closers I have ever heard, detailing the wreckage from a dying man's perspective.  One can almost feel the ghost of RVZ while listening to this track...and that is an unbelievable achievement.   <br /> <br />The Drive By Truckers have created a true modern day masterpiece.  Indeed, the reviews received upon release were all positive, sometimes even glowing.  But still, the real recognition goes to the trendy bands of the moment - but this record defies trends.  Over time its stature will undoubtedly grow, but for now you can experience it - pick this record up and spread the good word (and make sure you catch this band live).   <br />
B0002S94BG|5.0|I must admit, I was waiting a while for this reissue to come out, and ever since the first time I read the press release I've been excited about it. Did it deliver, now that I have it in my hand? <br />Yes. Even though I've scraped my way into owning nearly everything I can (within fiscal limits) that has been put out about Jeff, and the fact that I already had versions of many of these songs did not taint the fact that I was no longer stuck with versions that were in 128 kbps or less with everything above 12khz garbled horribly, but could now listen to Jeff in crystal clear 44100 kbps and enjoy every nuance that the recordings have to offer. Sure, some of the tracks have been included on other releases such as the Grace EPs box, but only three of them, one of which (Lost Highway) is now in better context with its pared-down brethren, were available before, and the chance to own the previously unreleased cuts along with the DVD make the release worth it.  <br />Everyone has made a big to-do about the fact that \\"Forget Her\\" was included on the second disc, but what I think are the real worthwhile cuts on the extra material are the Shudder to Think collaboration (which even though it was done extraneously to the sessions for Grace is still a great song that highlights the ever-floating contextual relevance of Jeff's voice against different stylistic backgrounds), and the unaccompanied covers of Nina Simone's \\"The Other Woman\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Mama, You've Been on my Mind.\\" If for no other reason, these last two covers are worth their salt because of Jeff's interpretation of the songs, which although they don't deviate very drastically from the originals still breathe with the importance of being songs that are important to Jeff, songs that he decided to do off the cuff because he knew them that well, the kind of songs that we don't see on other releases because they were the type of songs that he played for himself. That's what makes the included solo outtakes worth it--Jeff is playing to hear himself play (painfully though hilariously obvious on \\"Alligator Wine\\"). A studio is a damned intimidating place to be; you are there strictly because you will create something before you walk out of it. So the fact that in the face of this expectation, even though not holding to the main focus, Jeff softly reads through something like the Nina Simone song, makes the recording worth a listen. <br />Simply stated, having all the videos on one DVD is great... Now if only the BBC documentary could be packaged by itself for commercial release... <br />In short, if you like Jeff, this is worth it. For all the controversy surrounding Mary Guibert's handling of his estate, the decisions to license songs to places, etc., this package is definitely worth putting your reservations aside (if you have any) and purchasing. <br />I've never figured out why there seems to be such a collective thirst for Jeff's material; maybe because there is actually a tangible point where his archives are exhausted? Maybe simply due to the fact that he's deceased? Whatever the case may be, I also look for the answers. In every chord change, in every song that he played in multiple guitar tunings, in every melody, there is this surge... and I think that the reason people have invested their time into fully digesting what Buckley had to offer is because his music is driven purely by emotion, and that's what makes it so striking. It is the fact that there is nothing under the surface with his music that draws us to it again and again. There is nothing under the surface because it's all there out in the open, different parts beauty, anger, melancholy, and joy, all there for people to have. He never said that he wanted people to take anything specific from his music, merely whatever they wanted. This release offers you ample opportunity for that. Enjoy it. You'll be glad.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|HP 3 is definetly the best of the Harry Potter films (and most enjoyable.) Don't get me wrong, I love the first two (they're also great) but I felt that POA had better pacing and a more dark, mature tone. If you haven't seen this one yet I STRONGLY urge that you do!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Vol. 1 is nowhere near as good as vol.2. The story of the bride comes to an end in the most Epic of ways. With an ending that will come down in movie history. In my oppinion only two other movie seris had the best ending in a seris which is \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Matrix\\". And this movie WILL go along with the greatest movies of all time (but \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" is still number one in my book) dont rent it, dont even borrow it. Own it, its that great.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I've been a HUGE Star Wars fan for quite a long time and I'm very excited that they're finally coming to DVD. I'm definetly in the minority here, but I thoroughly enjoyed all the added scenes (I think it'll help these films flow better with the newer trilogy) but I can definetly see why most of you are upset (especially if you grew up in the 70's watching these films.) Other than Greedo shooting first, you have to admit that some of the additions aren't THAT bad! I don't know why most of you are making such a big deal about it (maybe Lucas will read some of these bad reviews and eventually decide to release the originals... It seems doubtful though.) Just be pleased that, at least, they're COMING TO DVD!
B00008EY65|4.0|I really enjoyed Hellboy. It is without a dought a must own movie. The only thing holding this back in my book is that the story is sometimes unbalaced...it has great patencial and is a great movie but the story does have some flous. In one hand it does a great job of pleaseing the croud and does many great jobs of dilivering a good movie that is well worth the maret, but in the other hand the story is in someways unbalaced to where yu loose the audience. But dont let that stop yu from watching Hellboy it is a great movie, and you will be pleased.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|Okay, first off I DO like the movie. It's just that I'm a HUGE fan, and the movie was a total dissapointment. I couldn't believe how much they DIDN'T go by the book. Not that I didn't enjoy it though. It's a Harry Potter film, and no matter how different it is from the book, I still like it. (Only because it's Harry Potter lol) Anyways, I'd rent it before you buy it. Because you might not like it. <br /> <br />*I gave it four stars just because I'm a fan*
B0000797IO|5.0|This is a great movie that gives a great moral leason. Which is,\\"In life you can do whatever you want but you must pay the concaquince\\". The story was great and the cast was unforgetable. Jake Gyllhenaal's character \\"Holden\\" is an remarkable and unforgetable acting proformance. Jennifer Anistins character \\"Tiney\\" is a great charcter but i have seen better performances from her on \\"Friends\\". All-in-all \\"The Good Girl\\" is a great movie, and maybe you will learn a leason from.
B0002IU988|4.0|This new band is related a lot to Creed, with the exception of a new lead singer.  Like Creed, Alter Bridge provides the listener with solid, consistent music, but with little variation.  Being a musician myself (drumming since 4th grade) I found Alter Bridge's drummer to have repetitive licks and beats;  however, the band does not fail to deliver steady, catchy tunes, especially tracks 1,2,3,6, and 7.  If you're looking for a decent rock album that has a fair amount of catchiness and does not attempt to cross other boundaries of music, this is the one for you.
B000274THQ|5.0|Oft-repeated images of East Germans joyfully surging through breaches in The Wall have obscured who was left behind.  In this charming story, we learn not all the DDR's residents resisted socialism.  Nor was reunification an unmodified blessing for all.  A half-century of Western propaganda's view of the East has blinded us to such people as Christiane Kerner.  Abandoned by her husband, who's fled to the West, she \\"marries\\" the socialist state, becoming a dedicated worker.  Seeing her son pummeled by Stasi agents during a demonstration, Christiane suffers a heart attack, lapsing into a coma.  Alexander, as devoted to her as she is to socialism, strives to assist her survival.  The surrounding world strives to defeat him.<br /><br />Honecker's DDR is collapsing around the family leaving Alexander with the task of trying to restore the past.  His mother's survival, when she awakens, depends on his success.  As the \\"man of the family\\" he struggles to keep his sister, her boyfriend, his own new girlfriend and his mother's colleagues on stage in his bizarre scenario.  Food jars are re-labelled, TV news is contrived and the new world of \\"freedom\\" is kept away.  However, the pressure of Coca Cola and Burger King is strong - and Alexander must cope with them all.<br /><br />Ironies abound in this stunning presentation of \\"the other side\\".  Alexander describes the DDR military as \\"the world's last great shooting club\\".  A demonstration becomes people \\"getting together for a little exercise\\".  Christiane's dedication, which has nothing to do with politics or philosophy, is intense, but not absolute.  She hungers for what she already has, but remains unfulfilled.  Socialism isn't perfect - she streams complaint letters to the authorities.  Her \\"marriage\\" to the ideal is reminiscent of Christian nuns.  Will she die \\"in the Faith\\" as so many others have done?  Becker uses this and other images masterfully.  The red banners of the DDR merge deftly those of Coca Cola, Germany's most recent invader.<br /><br />Becker's imagery and dialogue presentation is vivid and subtle at once.  He uses his characters brilliantly - Hitchcock would approve, even if there's no mystery to unveil.  With a contrasting mix of slow and fast action, Becker depicts the upheavals surrounding the collapse of German socialism with stunning clarity.  As the Special Features reveal, this film was cut by a third and the missing scenes are tantalising.  An film worthy of all its awards and attention.  Watch it and see \\"the other side\\" as it was.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]s most recent invader.   <br /> <br />Becker's imagery and dialogue presentation is vivid and subtle at once.

0385512104|1.0|I was so keen to read the book that absolutely EVERYONE was raving about. And to be honest when I finally did, Christopher annoyed me. When I compare Curious Incident to, for example, Catcher In the Rye, Paddy Clark ha ha ha..it just falls flat on its face. I can see what the author is doing-bringing a marginalised character to the centre of his novel...the way the boy is trying to find order in a chaotic world, how difficult it is for him to understand feelings and emotions, how pattern and routine play an important part in his daily life...BUT it ends there. The book does not leave me with a sense of...well, anything really. I was just glad to turn the last page and never have to look at it again.
B000244FDW|5.0|Finally, the uncut version of this series! I've had the VHS tape version for years and have always felt disappointed that it was missing so much. That version was 226 minutes. This DVD version is now 265 and returns the missing lines/scenes. I went straight home and watched this full version. I loved it. And David Rintoul has always been my favorite Darcy. I'm glad they produced this on DVD.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I first found this movie on the shelves of a foreign country and being that this was the only thing in english I could watch, I did just that.    The Big Lebowski's script is great. The dialogue has quotes that find their way into everyday converstaion after seeing this movie.  Everyone knows or has met a Dude like this once in their life... someone who just seems to coast by. Well this is the story of a man...     I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for dark comedies.  This movie is hilarious at points, and has interesting roles for Steve Buscemi and John Goodman.    Following the story line is difficult the first time around. So be sure to watch it at least twice to get the jokes you missed the first time around!!!!
B00005JMX6|5.0|Granted, there are A LOT of exposed breasts in this movie, but believe it or not, there's actually a pretty touching story here, too, acted to perfection by the two leads. I mean, Elisha Cuthbert is equal parts stunning, heartbreaking, and hysterical as the girl who just wants a fresh start, while Emile Hirsch portrays perfectly the goody-two-shoes who's willing to risk everything just to be with her. Definitely a lot better than the critics gave it credit for.
0393035158|4.0|It's about time someone wrote forcefully about the very unpopular reality of what religion has done through time-- and continues to do-- in justifying evil and retarding our development as a species.     Harris tackles some very complex theories about beliefs, reason and faith, in a way that even the average reader can grasp. While his comments are harsh when necessary -and will probably offend the faithful-his thesis is not without merit.     Since humans are resistant to having their core beliefs challenged (even successfully) this may be a hard read for some. But it is a necessary read if we are to have any hope of preserving our species. If we keep heading down the path we're on, our destruction is a near certainty.    This is not to say that this book is thoroughly depressing. Rather, Harris offers some paradigm shifts which must occur if there is to be any hope of finding humans on earth at the dawn of the next millennia.     I challenge any believer to take on the incontrovertible facts Harris puts forth, and to `argue' them with sound reasoning, not blind faith in unprovable concepts. This would be impossible.     I was most surprised that a book on this subject turned out to be a real page-turner I could not put down. For anyone with an open mind, I highly recommend it.
B00005JL78|5.0|Brace yourself - intelligent sci-fi isn't dead, nor is it an oxymoron. You wouldn't have known that for several years, with dull releases such as Alien:Resurrection, Battlefield Earth, the new Star Wars travesties, Chronicles of Riddick, and Starship Troopers littering the sci-fi landscape with one dreadful bomb after another. Minority Report breaks that chain, and shows Steven Speilberg in top form once again. <br /> <br />Of course it's Spielberg - who else is out there to bring 5 start science-fiction to the screen? This is the man that brought us E.T. over 20 years ago, also regarded as one of the greatest sci-fi movies in history. When he chooses to, Spielberg delivers movies with carefully crafted stories, fully developed characters that draw us in and that we care about, realistic scripts, and of course special-effects that support the film rather than stand center-stage as the main focus. This film is not only no exception, it raises Spielberg's bar. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise is well cast in his role as the cop at the center of the film, but the supporting cast is where the excellence truly lies. Max Von Sydow plays his role to perfection and never lets you really know, until the end, where his loyalties lie. Colin Farrell, playing Cruise's foil, is more than just Hollywood's new pretty boy here - this film gives him real meat to work with and act with. And he's really good at it. <br /> <br />This film exemplifies what science fiction film should be. Beyond eye-candy with too many special effect, sci-fi should be a reflection of our present condition and present day life, and should provoke us to think about ourselves, or our society, or our condition. This film does so and lends itself to multiple viewings, each time giving us something new to see or think about. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this film too many times. Easily one of the ten best science fiction films in history.
B00008EY65|1.0|The movie in my opinion was BORING.I had a hard time getting into the story as to whom Hellboy was fighting,the creatures or the evil Nazi character with the knife hands.And whats with the human fish character?I would rank him in the same category as Jar-Jar Finks.The fight scenes and special effects gets high marks,but the movie made me fell asleep at times.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I've seen a lot of reviews that call this CD something preposterous like \\"The Best CD of All Time\\" or something like that - let me just say that this is a great CD, but it's nothing like that.  I think that those reviews come from people who have just listened to some of the popular trash thats out there for too long (if saying that doesn't make me look like too much of a cynic).  Anyway, my point is that if you approach this CD with an open mind and don't try to prove that there are better CDs or that At The Drive In is better (which I disagree with anyway), you'll find that its a great listen and undoubetly worth your $10.  So go buy it and enoy it, but keep it in perspective.
B00006AW2F|5.0|I worked at a record store when this one came out.  A LOT of mud slinging from The 'Stones saying it was not them.  They were pretty adamant that they had no part in the album. <br />Too bad, as it was a real treat to my ears then and even today.  Some good work, and real gems.  It had more heart than Black and Blue or It's Only Rock n Roll.  Hmmm.   <br />Not a CD for the casual listener, it is for those of us who like to hear alternate versions and wrong turns in the studio.   <br />Andrew Loog Oldham messed about with the material quite a bit so you have to listen beyond the \\"gloss\\".  Underneath that you will hear material that SHOULD have seen the light of day.   <br />Oh heck, what do I know.  I like Between the Buttons! <br />-Jeff
0375500901|3.0|I was really excited about getting my hands on this book after reading some of the reviews but I really cannot highly recommend this one.  My number one complaint is that Allon comes off kinda lame. He is built up throughout the story but at every time he is to rise to the occasion, he falls flat.  Tariq is a interesting character but I am really confused to why he didn't kill the model when he killed all the other women without a second thought.  Overall, this book reminded me of something I would read in my college writing classes.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Prelude starts this excellent recording off and it goes right into The Blister Exists. Three Nil and Before I Forget are the songs that do it for me. I`ve heard alot of Slipknot`s work in the past, but Rubin did a fantastic job of showing off the group`s diverse talent. Any reviewer telling you to forget this album and buy something from Black Sabbath/Led Zeppelin or SoundGarden, just doesn`t get it. I grew up with these bands (Black Sabbath at the Garden in `77 and Zeppelin in `73/`75 and `77.) so after all these years I want something new and enjoy listening to a band with talent. Slipknot`s it. \\"Sold out\\" and \\"Commercial\\" are comments that cretins make when they`re not sure they have the intelligence to make a objected review. I like Kittie/E-town Concrete/Life of Angony/Nothing Face/OTEP/Soul Fly/Type O Neg and Seven Dust just to mention a few and Disturbed/SoundGarden and Dream Theatre (over done) aren`t an option. You already know what you`re getting with Slipknot so buy the CD and enjoy. Great vocals, reading the lyrics give an insight to the overall theme of the CD and you`ll hear something different even after 5 or six go rounds. 14 quality songs.
0061015725|3.0|While not an example of Crichton's best work, this one is still an enjoyable read. <br /> <br />The theme is already a bit over-done: technology gone awry in the hands of unscrupulous techno-masters, but this one appears to be destined for a movie contract.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This box set has everything you ever wanted to know about the Alien franchise available on 9 discs. There are 2 versions of each movie and a special features DVD for each movie plus 1 extra special features disc for miscillaneous facts. Way better than the Alien Legacy box set. A must have for any Alien fan.
B00008H2LB|5.0|A splendid cd it is everything hybrid theory was not. Although this may be my love of Linkin Park talking but theres nothing more that i need to settle me down than a few minutes of Breaking the Habit or From the Inside. its a both Brilliant and Original piece of work. Some people may say its exactly the same as hybrid theory but nay it is nothing like it its 100 + times better.
0671646788|5.0|Chapter 3 changed my life - got to start with this book while you are planning to climb the ladder of success in life. The best priviledge I have is lending out this book to people (as I have done it so many times) and see their lives starting to change for good! Catch the word in the title 'THINKING' and you have mastered the best success principle in life.
1591972086|5.0|Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a novel I think evrone should read at least once before they die. Lots of good detail. Out of every print of J&H published, I like the great illustrated classic one the best. Lots of cool pictures, and if you have kids this is a great way to show them the story. If you like this you should also rad the Invisble man.
B00005JNEI|5.0|There is nothing new in this movie. It is the freedom of speech made it interesting. I love it.
0060922583|5.0|Very enjoyable reading that is packed with possible explainations to questions like who are we, what is reality, where are we, and why. I do not recommend it for those with a \\"closed mind\\" that already have all the answers. Well worth the price.
B00005B36H|5.0|Let me start this review by stating that this is one of the best albums I have every heard.  By any standard, it is a masterpiece, but in the genre of 'Progressive Rock,' whatever the hell that is, it is quite possibly the best album ever produced.  The scope of this album is immense - long sequences of sedate, droning sounds, marked by explosions of energy that will stay with you long after you've put the album away.  The transitions between the two extremes are where the real magic happens.  This album is smart and aggressive, but to me completely accessible, because not a note is wasted.  Every drumbeat, every lyric, every chord has behind it the purpose of a greater vision, and in that, Tool has proven itself to be one of the most important bands currently making music.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Okay, I love Star Wars and have been waiting some time, like everyone else for this to come out on DVD.  And finally it's on the way. <br /> <br />I was pleased to know George Lucas has THX'd it too so mosaic should be somewhat reduced.  But why oh why no DTS?  George's THX tools are the market leader for mastering but why insist on using Dolby?  DTS is undisputibly the best and used on all new Disney films that have been THX'd too, like Monster's Inc, Finding Nemo. Even Tombstone had a THX overhaul and DTS added! <br /> <br />Had the trilogy featured DTS I would have given it 5 stars and it would have been perfect.  As OB1 said maybe \\"there is another...\\"
B0000009OP|5.0|This is a remarkable album.  The songwriting on this album is in my opinion some of the best that Sandman did.  The songs share an intensity that almost lashes out at you when you hear it, and at the same time there is a sort of sad beauty in each of them that all of us can relate to.  A tremendous effort from one of the most original bands of the past 15 years.
B0002I831S|5.0|Yes I'm tired of getting gouged.  Yes I was tired of waiting.  Yes I understand the principles of supply and demand.  And Yes I'm going to buy it.  The one show which still gives \\"each man hope and a common future.\\"  But look out Paramount.  I see a lot of angry people out there.  People who will associate a history of unfair marketing and exploitation of this timeless product. Go ahead and make your little bit of up front money.  I think Edward Demings would agree with me on this one, You're going to pay for it in the long run.  Signed, a dis-satisfied customer.
B00004U2A1|5.0|Despite what Shawn Watson writes in his previous review, this is the preeminent horror/comedy!  Zombie girlfriends, chainsaws, possession, self amputation, flying eye-balls, and oh . . . that Henrietta and her fruit cellar!  There's so much to love!  The horror is slap stick and the comedy is gruesome.  So many directors have borrowed from the directorial style that Sam Rami perfected in this very movie!  Once you've seen it, you'll realize some of your favorite movies pay homage to this one.  Bruce Campbell is awesome and you'll be quoting his character Ash long after the movie ends.  IF YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR and are not put off by graphic horror, this film is easy to enjoy.  There are many reasons the cult following behind this film grows every year.  Check it out for yourself and JOIN US!<br /><br />P.S. - There are presently net rumors that the next Jason VS. Freddy movie will include Ash from the Evil Dead movies!  Director Rami is in talks right now to possibly lend Ash to \\"Jason VS. Freddy VS. Ash\\"  The cult has gone main-stream!
B00002E233|5.0|Very well written and laid out nicely. The actors are convincing, and the story folds out nicely. I highly reccomend this movie.
B000002HEP|5.0|Kyuss's third album, Welcome to Sky Valley, is difficult to discribe in human language. To that end, it is impossible to believe that mortal men are responsible for creating what is quite possibly the greatest album in recorded history.     While Blues for the Red Sun was easily one of the best records no one has ever heard, Welcome to Sky Valley is the best record that man will never appreciate simply because he is not able to.  On the surface, this album seems to promise the same premise as its predecessor: Thundering Riffs, amazing rhythms, stark desert poetry, and classic tracks. Make no mistake, Welcome to Sky Valley has all that and more.     The opening track, Gardenia, has to be the one of the greatest intro songs ever recorded by human beings. The massive riff was like nothing ever done. Each song flows into the next almost seamlessly, which makes you understand  that this album is not a collection of songs, but a single cohesive piece of music.  There is not one weak piece of music on this one. It seems to be more diverse than Kyuss's previous efforts. The thundering Gardenia, the relaxed Space Cadet and the drug like Asteroid make this one a varied piece of desert rock.     The last time i listened to this one( which was like 15 min prior to me writing this), I swore I was in Barstow, California, with the high heat and Joshua  Trees reminding me of simpler time when music was not just a product, but an energetic release of emotion, chaos and beauty. Buy this one at all costs.     It is not necessarily a requirement for rock fans, but for all humans to listen to and see that people are capapble of creating some of the startling pieces of art. Put the disc in, let in spin and soon you will be at peace...
0393035158|4.0|It is both odd and a mistake to refer to this book as \\"ineffectual\\". Mr. Harris points out something which, one hopes, we all already know. And that is, despite its ability to blind us emotionally, despite the fact that in most cases people come to embrace religion through some form of indoctrination, or in the case of President Bush, come to it as a substitute for other forms of intoxication, religion as an artifact of human thought has long outlived its usefulness. We are no longer tribes squatting in huts teaching our children that the world is flat and if the weather turns it's because some god is angry about the clothes we wear. Problem being that today, in place of sticks and rocks we have big, powerful and easily portable weapons.<br /><br />What is effective about this book is that it finally opens the door to this virtually taboo observation: Middle east or West, by being treated as infallible and unquestionable, religion quantifiably does more harm than good. Mr. Harris points out just how utterly antiquated and basically wrong so many religious tracts are by using the tracts themselves. Proof enough that religions no longer hold the key to human happiness is demonstrated by the convenient \\"editing\\" of some tenets of faith by none other than the faithful who, in our culture, get closer to god by picking and choosing those aspects of the word of god which best suits the starkly more secular and practical aspects of their lives. Is everybody comfy? Good.<br /><br />It is even more important and highly effective to point out how faith continues to divert our society from coming to terms with the objective facts which define the issues facing us today in favor of consistently relying on belief. The dangers of this practice in our daily social and political life are being felt in innumerable ways, and the danger continues to grow. By connecting the way in which religious beliefs affect our world, our interaction with others and with a more objective reality, Mr. Harris has helped begin the only conversation that really matters.ped begin the only conversation that really matters.
B000002J0B|4.0|It may have been difficult to top Led Zeppelin's fourth Album, but with this record, the band opted not to top it but just to make great music. Houses of the Holy is a great record that doesn't demand great listening attention. The band seems to have had a great time recording this one as many of the songs are upbeat and happy. The only one that isn't is No Quarter, which is one of the band's finest compositions. As a whole, Houses of the Holy is great rock music, one that deserves to be in any Zeppelin fan's collection. It may seem like haphazardly through together music, but that is the point. Led Zeppelin made a fun record and made it well. You should definitely check this one out.
B000005IS1|5.0|I bought this \\"LP\\" when it first came out and even my peers looked at me funny.  My parents thought I was totally lost in some subversive movement.  Kick Out the Jams was a racuously wild sonic party then and now on CD it still ploughs the audio furrow deep and wide with conviction.  My LP is long gone (probably a victim of party-itis in some 70's college party) but the CD brought on the haunted chills of familiarity from a quite different era. If you like \\"punk anything else\\" (Sex Pistols, Ramones, etc.) you will like the MC5 to bring it all back home from where it all started.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Don't you know now... Well this is how it was, and full marks to Cam Crowe and his insanely talented team for blessing us with this dead-on insight into the world of a touring Rock band and the role of the journalistic 'Enemy'. <br /> <br />Cameron and wife Nancy Wilson of Heart even wrote many of the songs, including the superb Fever Dog, with some additional contributions from music guru and Rock God, Peter Frampton. There is also a delightful cameo by Peter as the Humble Pie manager, Reg. Peter was the Pie's lead guitarist, along with the sadly late Stevie Marriott. <br /> <br />Not only is this a flawless piece of casting, including the always excellent Frances McDormand as Pat's Mom, but the band are totally believable, even though Billy Crudup and the brilliant Jason Lee weren't even musicians at the outset. You don't get a piece of this quality without a great deal of hard work, research, and attention to detail, and between Peter Frampton and Cameron himself, they have ensured that the finished product is a work of Art. <br /> <br />The Bootleg Cut is absurd value, featuring the extended version of the movie, plus the original and an excellent 6 track CD, which includes the Wilson-Crowe classics Fever Dog, Love Thing and Love Comes And Goes. <br /> <br />Stillwater are totally believable as a band, musically and visually, and the Cleveland Concert (one of the numerous Special features) looks 100% genuine. Jason's Paul Rogers of Bad Company look is perfect, and his lip-synching is flawless. Likewise Billy's guitar playing. <br /> <br />Kate Hudson absolutely shines, as does newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays 'Cameron'. Naturally, to quote Jason, \\"the chicks are good\\", as you might expect with a collection of stunning and talented actresses that includes Kate, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Olivia Rosewood and Bijou Phillips. Yes, it's a BabeFest. <br /> <br />Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, with a simply stunning soundtrack. Aaaaaah The Rain Song...  <br /> <br />Take me now, Fairuza... <br />
B000059HAI|4.0|This Pearl Harbor movie still remains the best treatment of the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. What really works with this film was that both sides are accurately, fairly and without much bias, portrayed by the filmmakers. The internal struggles within the Japanese leadership as well as complacency of the Americans were clearly shown.<br /><br />This movie remains totally superior to that overblown mess of the movie that came out several years ago called \\"Pearl Harbor\\", probably one of the worst movies ever made so far in this century.<br /><br />It bit ironic but I thought that the Japanese scenes were done better then the American scenes. Japanese scenes seem to have more drama, better script and better direction. American scenes seem to be bit flat in many areas. The special effects for the movie still haven't aged that much. Its still as impressive as I first saw it back in the 1970s.<br /><br />As for the DVD, its cheap, the anamorphic transfer proves to be quite excellent, wide screem format really helped this movie and its unthinkable to watch it in \\"TV format\\". What a waste that would be. The DVD don't have much extra outside of a short 20 minute documentary but I enjoyed the commentary by Richard Fleischer and Stuart Galbraith. The sound is in DD 4.1 and it seem to be pretty clear and strong to my humble speaker system.<br /><br />Overall, a very good movie, well acted, well directed and above all, a very fair approach to the subject.
B000002L9W|5.0|This truly is one of the greatest guitar albums ever recorded! Spectacular work.  <br />If Eddie left Van Halen And Dave Called Frank Zappa this is what it would sound like. Vai Looked cooler than frank soooo. too bad it didn't last WOW!
0399143904|5.0|I think Rainbow Six is one of Tom Clancy's best known books and I know why. Because it's great. Perfect story, perfect character development (especially Dmitry Popov) and it's perfectly written. It's definitively not too long, I can't imagine how shorter would Clancy write this story. This book is great, from the first page to the last one.

078322608X|5.0|This is perhaps the most misunderstood romantic movie of all times. <br /> <br />Or maybe mine is just a very particular interpretation of it. <br /> <br />Like _Brazil_, another masterpiece, _12 Monkeys_ deals with an ill-starred love affair in a setting so dense with ideas it is very difficult to see the tree in such a forest. The themes touched are many: ecology and ecoterrorism; viruses and apocalypse; the Cassandra complex; time travel; madness and awareness; consumerism; etc. But in this forest of themes, sometimes so dense as to be mind boggling, the central element is what two people feel for each other. <br /> <br />We're hinted at the nature of the central theme by recurring bits along the movie: the dream, the persecution scenes (Cole and Dr. Railly spend their time together on the run), the way they both become aware of each other, the spy who finally tells Cole he wants her, and above all the scene in the movie theatre where _Vertigo_ is playing. <br /> <br />_Vertigo_, a Hitchcock masterpiece, also deals with an ill-starred romance and, just like _Brazil_ and _12 Monkeys_, the reasons why it can't be are unsurmountable: in _Vertigo_, Johnny-O falls for a woman who has taken the personality of another woman already dead, so the love-object does not really exist; in _Brazil_, the omnipotent state is between Sam and Jill; in _12 Monkeys_, the inetability of destiny is interposed between James and Kathryn. <br /> <br />Also, like in _Vertigo_, both characters develop true romance while going in the car. The acting by Willis when he listens to music for perhaps the first time, when he breathes in the air without germs, when he sees the beautiful skies and shining light of day, is, in my opinion, superb. All these things we take for granted, just like love, are denied to this social outcast in that moribund future. <br /> <br />The scene outside the movie theater had me in tears. Here they are, kissing for the first and last time, and he looks at Kathryn andsays: \\"in my dream... it was you... always.\\" <br /> <br />Dystopias usually exist to warn people of the dangers in the present and how they might affect the future. \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" are typical examples. Books tend to focus on the more brainy side of it, but in the end it is the individual who matters. And nothing is more proper to the free person than her or his feelings. <br /> <br />The dystopic vision in _Brazil_ or _12 Monkeys_ is senseless. A giant apparatus that exists for no purpose, except perhaps to make the lives of most people empty but acceptable. Love breaks that: it is the ultimate meaning-giver. That such love is impossible gives the people taking part in it the character of heroes in a greek tragedy--they know nothing can be done, they know what they're doing is foolish, but they do it the same because it is who they are in their most intimate recesses of their soul. <br /> <br />James Cole is given a final choice: he kills or Kathryn is killed. He's not told who he's supposed to shoot, but we can infer it is himself. His duty is to die, so he can be a hero. So he runs to meet destiny, and we're left with the pieces of a circular time where these two people are condemned to meeting again and again, always towards the same despairing, inevitable end. <br /> <br />This is a very dense movie open to many interpretations. As usual, Gilliam is insightful, smart, and does not say everything in order to make you think your alternate and very personal version. The DVD is very good, with an excellent documentary (\\"The Hamster Effect\\") that touches on topics that won't be unfamiliar to many of us. The acting is first rate, with Brad Pitt giving an amazing performance, similarly for Willis and Stowe. <br /> <br />_12 Monkeys_ is a demanding, literate movie that will be better appreciated by those who love a good dose of thought in their books and movies.

B000000OQF|5.0|It just doesn't get much better than this! From the album cover to the tunes this is a must own piece of music. Some of the best guitar licks you'll ever hear, kudos to Slash.  Sounds as fresh today as it did back in the day. This is everything Nirvana wished they could have produced and failed at so miserably, no wonder Kurt hated Axl. I just wish Axl would pull his head out and make some new music. As close to perfect as you can get for a metal album.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Great action sequences if you like Matrix/martial arts action flicks- My personal nit was for an advanced society, Prozium has one heck of a short half life! One dose missed and our hero to be starts feeling. <br /> <br />Most disturbing scene- the one with the dogs. Esp. the puppy running to Preston and how/if he would save it. Had to stop the DVD. <br /> <br />Very cool set designs with grandiose concrete architecture. <br /> <br />Odd things- nice of the prison to provide Mary with makeup, and the pick of Preston's former partner (and Mary) in a plaid shirt? <br /> <br />Some Qs: Marriages? How would you dull the emotions of little kids? Babies?
B000003TA4|1.0|I am still amazed at the magnitude critics go to jump on the Nirvana bandwagon to this day.  When Rolling Stone named the top 100 guitarists of all-time and rated Kurt Co\\"pain\\" higher than Eddie Van Halen I reached my meltdown point.  This band is the worst thing that happened to music.  At least Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters have a sense of humor and play some good tunes.  Nirvana had it's day and it's time to move on.  Does anyone remember how to play the guitar?  We now refer to the singer of a band as a vocalist because no one sings anymore.  Thanks Nirvana for a whole lotta nothing!
0446677450|3.0|this is intended for people just starting to show an interest in personal finance and wealth management.  as such if you are just begining, you shouldnt be buying any books.  instead get a library card and consume as many as you can.  all of these introductory finance books are small and light reading, at less than 300 pages i burn through them, one book every two days. <br /> <br />this is much more of a motivational book than an informative guide.  if you are intellectually sedentary, and looking for a better way to look at things, a better perspective on life and wealth in general this may light a fire under your ass.  but it may not.  if you are looking to change your point of view i would reccomend some philosophy in addition to whatever financial research you are doing.  besides the established masters i would recommend James P. Carse's \\"Finite and Inifite Games\\".  it really does frame life in general in a very pragmatic and objective way.   <br /> <br /> <br />so why the 3 stars?  it does have some good things in there, and if you didnt know them before you should learn them.  learn the difference between assets and liabilities.  i agree with his idea that owning your own home is a liability.  i agree that investment property is a great way to get to financial independance, infact i have several relatives that did just that.  BUT, it is really contingent on hitting the right market.  my relatives hit north jersey back in the 60s and 70s, kiyosaki hit phoenix when it was hot.  i agree that the education system is sorely lacking in this area and that it should be taught (along with philosophy) in elementary on up. <br /> <br />my one contention is that most people should have already come to this conclusion on their own.  my other is that the book does nothing to elaborate any further on the subject.  it stays vague, maybe to encourage you to buy more books in the series, maybe to not pin itself down to one thing.  a much better primer would be Andrew Tobias's\\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need\\".  Of course it wont be the only investment guide you'll need but it clearly explains the myriad of different investment opions, which will allow you to make informed decisions on what you may want to invest in and research in depth next.
B000077VT7|5.0|This is a very different thriller, with one of the most intriguing characters I have seen in a thriller.  A body is pulled from the ocean with a couple of bullet holes in the back.  Amazingly, the man is still alive.  He is treated by the ship's physician and slowly brought back to health.  The only problem is that he lost his memory.  The physician finds a metal nugget in the man that projects a bank safety deposit box number.  <br /> <br />With no clue as to who he is, the man goes to the bank and is able to get to the box with his thumbprint as his identification.  Inside the box he finds a slew of passports, currency and weapons.  Each of the passports is under different names.  He uses the one that says Jason Bourne and when he uses it for travel, the immigration computer sets off a whole bunch of alarms to some CIA operatives that very much want him dead.  <br /> <br />At a US embassy, Jason eludes his assassins (through some highly refined combat techniques and climbing skills) and asks for a ride from a lady he saw at the embassy.  She takes him, unknowingly putting herself in danger.  The two of them need to unravel Jason's mystery as to who he is, why he has the skills that he has, and why are the government agents trying to kill him. <br /> <br />Jason and the woman (Marie) head to Paris to an address that Jason lived at.  There Jason is attacked by a hitman who has photos of both Jason and Marie that were taken back at the embassy.  Suddenly Marie realizes that she is stuck with Jason fighting unknown enemies, just to stay alive. <br /> <br />The movie is quite different than the book of the same name but is excellent nonetheless.  Matt Damon appears well cast and all the CIA operatives are excellent as well (Julia Styles plays one of them).  The actress that plays Marie does a passable job and there seems to be a good chemistry that evolves between her and Damon. <br /> <br />A non-stop roller coaster ride with some great car chases thrown in.  This movie is one of the best thrillers that I have seen! <br />
0393035158|3.0|I enjoyed the book but am waiting for more scientific or psychological research that will give us more insight into why people are compelled to blind religious faith.  <br /> <br />The author focuses on the phenomenon that religious people have throughout history committed violent crimes.  <br /> <br />It's easy to see why this might happen: Most people are sinners. The sinner fights mightily to keep up the walls that prevent him from seeing his dark side clearly. When a sinner realizes there's a way out by believing in God, he allows such suppressed knowledge to flood his consciousness. At the same moment, his sins are now completely forgiven. Sometimes what has to be admitted is that the world is a scary place full of sinners. It's easier to accept if - at the same moment - the individual believes that he is on God's side and that God will personally protect him. <br /> <br />So people often find religion because they are loathe to admit such things all by themselves. But under God's protection, once they admit of their selves as sinners, they can then - during that same instantaneous break - feel good because now they don't have to worry about eternal damnation. And now that God loves them, they can do all those bad things again and not feel guilty about it. Hence, once individuals of a certain personality type are converted, they would rather kill then once again feel guilt, fear of the world, or fear of eternal damnation.  <br /> <br />Ironic, isn't it.
0385336810|1.0|I truly do not understand all the adulation this book has received. I'm a big fan of chick lit, but this book has to be one of the sillier, more badly written chick books around. The whole premise of someone being so frightened by airplane turbulence that she would blurt out her entire life history (including the details of how/when she lost her virginity?!) to the person sitting next to them on the plane--how silly is that?! How long did that turbulence on the flight last anyway--12 hours or so? That's how long it'd have taken for the moronic Emma to relate all her life's stultefying details to the unfortunate what's-his-name (and I can't remember his name 'cos he's utterly forgettable). The other plot elements in this novel get even more contrived, inane and annoying as the tedious book wears on--it felt like a 1000 pages. Not a book for those who enjoy their chick lit humor spiced with wit and intelligence.
B00008EY9G|3.0|First of all, beware of some reviews posted here that will spoil the ending of the movie. This is a pretty cool little thriller, and I promise not to give away any of the storyline. The movie does borrow heavily from other films of the genre, and I kept finding myself thinking of those other movies while watching this one. Add elements of \\"And Then There Were None\\" mix it with \\"Momento\\" and add a touch of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and this is the movie that you get. John Cusack and Ray Liotta are always fun to watch, and Amanda Peet does a good job here too. (Is she in every movie made these days?) The rain soaked motel is a great setting for a thriller, and really gives you a good sense of isolation. I guess the biggest problem with the movie is that the director never lets the suspense build, you get a taste and then the scene is resolved. You don't get a prolonged build up that keeps you squirming with \\"Identity\\", it's almost like a whole string of little suspenseful scenes tied together. If you like a decent thriller \\"Identity\\" isn't bad, but it's not something you will go back to and watch again and again.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I dont know who started it, but for some reason everybody seems to think MUSE sounds a whole lot like bends era radiohead.  I love radiohead, but you know what guys, the majority of radioheads stuff recently has been more akin to the prog/space rock they started putting out circa OK Computer, and MUSE isn't anything like that. On that note, comparisons to the bends are totally unfounded, its not even close to being the same thing.  To me, they sound a lot more like fantasy metal (minus the metal) meets a sort of defeatest straight operatic rufus wainwright.  A great album from start to finish.  The lyrics are'nt incredibly original, but the music and vocals are done so passionately that you could'nt care less.
0345457684|4.0|Richard K. Morgan's first published novel is an effective blend of hardboiled detective story and cyberpunk. Takeshi Kovacs is a highly trained ex-special operations soldier (aka Envoy) whose body has been killed, his personality digitally stored \\"on stack\\" for crimes on his home world. When a very wealthy and influential man on Earth dies, he buys the convict's personality, has it downloaded to a body on good ol' terra firma, and sets Kovacs to the task of solving his death: was it suicide or murder? <br /> <br />While this is overall a well-written novel, there are also several of those moments that make you want scream, \\"What was he THINKING?\\" For instance, twice in the course of the story, Morgan has characters, one Kovacs, the other a veteran cop, drawing their guns - auto pistols - and dramatically racking the slides to chamber rounds before going into action, or while actually being attacked. Speaking as a 2002 state combat pistol champion who's been making his living evaluating and writing about guns for the past 12 years, let make this really simple for you: no one with two brain cells to rub together carries an auto pistol without a round already in the chamber. Certainly not an experienced special ops soldier or a tough-as-nails police detective. A minor bit of research on guns here would have prevented Morgan making this rookie mistake. <br /> <br />Then he has Kovacs, post-firefight, reloading his gun by popping out the partially spent magazine, then laboriously fishing a spare out of his jacket pocket (of COURSE he didn't carry it easily accessible in a spare magazine pouch, those highly trained killers always have their spare ammo rattling about in the bottom of a pocket, natch), inserting the fresh magazine into the gun, then racking the slide to chamber a cartridge. Uh, no. After you're fired an auto pistol and you've still got a half-loaded mag in the gun, there's ALREADY a round in the chamber. Jeez. Obviously Morgan knows very little about guns but thinks it's really bitchin' and macho to show a character racking an auto pistol's slide. I mean, that's how you know someone's SERIOUS. Right? <br /> <br />Also, I must admit I found it a bit irritating the way Morgan, time after time throughout the book, referred to the detachable box that holds ammunition and inserts into an auto pistol's butt as a \\"magazine\\" in one sentence, and a \\"clip\\" in the very next. These are not synonyms. In some guns we do have what are called \\"clips.\\" A clip is a non-mechanical device, i.e. it has no moving parts, it's just a piece of metal, designed to hold cartridges for storage, or so they can go into a magazine. A magazine is a mechanical device, it has moving parts, designed to hold cartridges so they can go into a firing chamber. Imagine you were a computer programmer, and how jarring you'd find it if a writer continually referred to a RAM as a ROM. I mean, who cares, they're almost the same thing. Right? <br /> <br />Then we have the scene where Kovacs is standing on the street, over the body of a friend who's just been tossed from a car. The verbiage goes, \\"...I lowered myself into a crouch beside Ortega and reached down to her face....warm breath stirred around my fingertips. I felt blindly toward the neck for a pulse and found it, weak but stable.\\" <br /> <br />Why is it the two things most writers get wrong are always guns and first aid? Speaking as a graduate of the EMT course, here's a basic fact for you: as soon as the heart stops beating, a person immediately stops breathing. If a person is breathing, de facto their heart is beating, there's no need to check for a pulse. This is basic first aid. A highly trained, combat experienced spec ops veteran like Kovacs would know that. <br /> <br />Then Kovacs tells Ortega to bug out, and gets in the car so the bad guy, an assassin who's sworn Kovacs' death, can kidnap him to his probable demise. WHY? To protect Ortega? Please. Kovacs had Mr. Bad Guy covered with his gun, he had the upper hand. True, there were two muscleheads in the car, as well, but (a) he didn't know that yet, (b) he'd already demonstrated numerous times throughout the book he could handle such pug uglies without breaking a sweat. So why get in the car? Why risk his life? Why not just shoot the bad guy, deal with the inconsequentialities in the car, then trip merrily on his way? Well, obviously because Morgan wanted to get Kovacs into the death trap to come. The deus ex machina was in full view at this point, the wires moving the character like a puppet not even hidden. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this novel. But I would have enjoyed it more with the addition of some basic research on Morgan's part about firearms and first aid, and a bit less artificiality moving the plot forward at times.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|These guys are relatively proficient at sounding like a cheap rip-off of XTC circa 1981, but how does this equal the next big thing?  This is all part of the Strokes-inspired wave of nostalgia for the 1980's that is getting more airplay than any \\"alternative\\" music has for a long while.  It was great in 1981, but do we need a blow-by-blow repeat almost twenty-five years later?  What's next, a Vapors cover band at No. 1?  A tribute to Bow Wow Wow?  How about Kajagoogoo?  Throw Franz Ferdinand in with the Killers (a Talk Talk copy) and the bevy of other knock-offs and witness the next generation of bands that will be overflowing in the used bins for the next five years until everyone forgets they ever existed.<br /><br />I should have known better than to buy this.  I really tried to give it a chance.  But after six or so listens this one is no longer allowed to blemish my record collection.  In the words of the immortal Paul Westerberg: \\"You weren't that bad/ being a world-class fad./ Just remember where you come from.\\"  Maybe if they make their guitars sound like bagpipes like their infinitely-more-inspired fellow Scots Big Country, they'll be an even better world class fad.<br /><br />P.S.--The only truly wonderful band to come from this 80's nostalgia trip are the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.  They take influences (e.g. SY, Siouxsie, Birthday Party) like these other poseurs, but actually manage to sound like THEMSELVES and like they actually WANT TO BE ORIGINAL unlike the rest of this brat-pack.  Novel concept.
B000059ZLH|1.0|The sound of this dvd is very low and noisy.i cant really enjoy it for that reason.the other aspects of the dvd are ok. <br />tks a lot to all the amazon reviews for warning me of this flaw!!! <br /> <br />
0345451325|5.0|I have to admit im very biased towards military sci fi.  Its hard for me to review this book without mentioning Starship Troopers and Enders Game (which are oustanding), Fall of Reach is in the same vein and it has and excelent flow, the pages just keep turning themselves. To be perfectly honest I found that the game seriously lagged at the end, but this book most definately does not, it helps to put the whole Halo universe in perspective and it's a fun read, it could just as easly stand on it's own.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Say what you will about Britney, sure she's doesn't have Christina's voice, Janet's dance ability, or even a nock for telling the truth.  But she does know how to make the kind of pop music she does.  MATM should not have been a single.  But the song \\"Toxic\\" is an undeniable hit from star to finish.  \\"Everytime\\" is a sweet, gentle ballad that makes use of Spear's barely capable voice.  The songs \\"Breath on Me\\" & \\"Touch of my hand\\" are also very good.  Britney's biggest problem is herself-----She's no longer a girl, not willing to become a woman yet.  thats fine, just deal with the consequences that come your way.   <br />
B00003CXA4|5.0|Edit: The core point below is that clashes of millions of adherents of different religions, i.e. Catholic versus everyone else, Muslim versus Hindu, are not new, and the past does indeed demonstrate that force of arms is an ineffective means--indeed a pathological means that makes it worse--for addressing such schisms.  Gandhi, and Gandhi alone, has shown the way with proven success at the level of Nations and Peoples.<br /><br />9-11 focused some of us, but not enough of us, on the monumental issues of war and peace such as have not occurred since World War II--the Cold War being, as Derek Leebaert documents so well in \\"The Fifty Year Wound\\", a false war, one with enormous costs to all mankind.<br /><br />I bought this video recently--having seen it many years ago--to refresh my memory on the essence of Gandhi and his proven concept of non-violent resistance.  The DVD capped several years of reading in the non-fiction national security arena (see my other 470+ reviews on war and peace), and has proven to be the ultimate primer as well as the ultimate Master's Seminar.<br /><br />This is the movie to watch if you want to get down to fundamentals; Gandhi's three basic lessons of war and peace as shown so beautifully here are these: 1) the only devils are in our own minds; 2) the separation of Pakistan and India, like the separation of Palestine and Israel, violated the civil order between Muslims and Hindus, and destroyed all that Gandhi had achieved: peaceful coexistence of peoples within a single nation; and 3) in the end, after great pain, truth and love inevitably triumph.<br /><br />Although I was tempted to fast-forward to the current six-front 100-year war between radicalized Islam and militarized America on the one hand, and between impoverished billions and corporate America on the other, I paused to reflect on the past first.  It was the Spanish who first committed genocide against the American Indians, who expelled the Muslims and then the Jews, who sponsored the Inquisition and the Crusades.  It was the British who stupidly pitted Muslim against Hindu in their attempts to assert their imperial will--nothing makes them look as stupid as the movie's coverage of how the \\"Empire\\" forbade the locals to take salt from their very own sea: the Indian Sea.<br /><br />Now I fast forward to our current circumstances, with special reference to Jonathan Schell's \\"Unconquerable World,\\" perhaps complemented by Clyde Prestowitz' \\"Rogue Nation\\" (the US), and Chalmers Johnson \\"Sorrows of Empire\\"--and the other 470+ books relevant to war and peace today.  Bottom line: boy, have we screwed this up.  First off, invading Afghanistan made Al Qaeda stronger, not weaker.  Second off, invading Iraq has made America weaker, not stronger, and inflamed the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Africa, the Pacific Rim, and the Muslim populations in the Americas.<br /><br />We need a Gandhi.  I cannot think of any modern leader who is even close, although the current Pope has certainly tried.  This movie depicts, in terms stark and relevant, the opposite of 9-11--the clash of mobs driven by ideology or religion, completely oblivious to the core facts that Gandhi tried to teach: non-violence, love, truth, the Golden Rule.

B00005JMCT|1.0|Well, what can I say? When I first saw this at the video store I said to my wife, \\"If I ever want to rent this movie, please shoot me in the head immediately.\\" Well the next week I was back at the video store and, you guessed it, I was renting this shocking movie. If only my wife had lived up to her promise, I would have not wasted my life watching this garbage. Yes, I would be dead, but happier. <br /> <br />The jokes are so desperate. They labor hard and long but absolutely no humour is achieved, its amazing! The jokes fall flat and are obscene: not obscene in their content (this movie is about as challenging as a haircut), but obscene in the contempt that the director, writers and actors have for us the audience by believing we would actually find this funny. <br /> <br />Speaking of the actors, it was interesting to see how bored and underused Thomas Ian Nicholas and Alyson Hannigan were. In shockingly unfunny scenes such as the bucks night Nicholas, like throughout the entire movie, looked like he didn't know whether he was a character or a piece of furniture.  <br /> <br />And now to Stiffler. Well let me say this: Bill Murray playing a deranged greens keeper, finding a Babe Ruth Chocolate Bar at the bottom of a swimming pool (a swimming pool that has been sterilized because said chocolate bar has been mistaken for a human turd), picking up the chocolate bar, inspecting it and then proceeding to eat it while the snobby wife of a snobby judge faints believing him to be eating excrement is hilarious.(Caddyshack). An idiot eating a dog turd isn't. (American Wedding). <br /> <br />Please avoid this movie, or watch it in the same way you would view \\"Triumph of the Will\\", not for entertainment, but as an education to see how far into madness the human race can go. However, while the tennents of National Socialism are idiotic, de-humanizing and genocidal, this movie is just pure evil. If you liked this movie, then I do apologize, but you are insane.
B00005JMUA|2.0|For a few shining scenes, specifically the ones with Michael Madsen, there was hope. To see Madsen, older now and hulking, sitting on the stoop of his trailer out in the middle of nowhere, I imagined I might be watching a real movie. But once Madsen exited the proceedings, the whole thing blew away like papier-mâch&eacute; leaves.<br /><br />I'll be brief. This is an adolescent work by a child that has been given a lot of money, time, and expensive toys to play with. Tarantino seems to have learned his lessons well. Jackie Brown was a modest picture but a very good one, but it didn't quite produce the splash the director or the studios that hire him need like junkies slobbering for crack. Kill Bill will make a ton of money and get much more media attention, so everyone's happy.<br /><br />The final scene is so hopelessly boring, wordy, and overdone I was actually squirming in my seat with embarrassment. The babbling \\"Bill\\" does about his theories on the mythology of Superman, and how they relate to the Thurman character, was the kind of crap you think is cool when you're sixteen and high as a kite. Tarantino's childish, romantic fascination with killers and assassins is a sad thing to behold. Someone really should tell him that real life assassins for hire are normally middle-aged ciphers with bad skin. The contempt the director has with average citizens, like Thurman's intended husband (the owner of a used record store in a small town) smacks of a heartless and pathetic self-loathing.<br /><br />I watched this mess the night after I had watched another film, William Dieterle's The Devil and Daniel Webster. Suffice to say the differences between the two films, with regard to maturity and mastery of craft, are striking. Of course, The Devil and Daniel Webster was made in the forties, when directors weren't allowed to (...) in public. --Mykal Banta
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums so far this year.  It's refreshing and original.  Great pop music here!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This is the type of CD you will fall instantly in love with and listen to continuously until you wear it out.  Somehow this band seems to perfectly blend the sounds of 80s alternative rock with the modern stuff.  It's fresh, fun, energetic and still manages to rock your mom.  Check out the audio samples, if you still don't believe me.  Tracks 1,3,4,10 are the highlights.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Mr. Rice is so underappreciated in the US.  This is my favorite album of 2003.  (One of my favorites of 2004 is the companion B-Sides).  His voice will make you melt, his lyrics will move you.
B000002MUQ|3.0|This is a good album, but it sounds so 1994 instead of the January 1995 release date.  Can't Stop Loving You could have sounded better that year.  However the musicianship is still good and Sammy sounds more superb on the singing here.  The first song still sounds good to this day and should have been on that just released Best Of Both Worlds double CD.  Not Enough could have sounded good in an action film.  But Balance shows the band's more mature side and I noticed it when I heard it in the music and songwriting.  The wilder sides were toned down for this one.

B00005221M|5.0|This faithful rendering of Cooper's classic gives a fabulous view of colonial America set against the backdrop of the French and Indian War. Hawkeye and his adopted Mohican family are drawn unwillingly into the conflict when they rescue Cora and Alice Monroe, the daughters of the colonel beseiged in Fort William Henry. Wes Studi is menacing as the evil Magua and Russell Means gives his best performance as Chingachgook. The cinemetography is breathtaking and the musical score adds to the thrill. The massacre at Fort William Henry, based on an actual event, and the torture scenes are grisly but not too much of a turnoff. Highly recommend for the historical quality, the great performances, and a thrilling adventure story.

6305971099|3.0|The viewer has to suspend belief too many times for this to be really scary, and the cute kids get to be too much after awhile. All the worst cliches are resurrected....teenagers are killed having sex, etc. The most interesting thing about this flick is the ending....who saved Michael Myers? Lucifer, maybe? It's even more unsatisfying that we never know.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Anyone that records Robert Johnson is setting themselves a task - there's a certain feel to his music that cannot be mucked around with.  Here Clapton mostly loses the plot.  The cover seems to indicate the album might be another unplugged set which could have been wonderful, but the big bass and drum sound behind a heavily distorted guitar on many tracks just doesn't get to the soul of the music.  A couple of songs like Me and the Devil Blues and Last Fair Deal Gone Down come off OK, but all in all this pales alongside the two Johnson albums made by his old associate Peter Green.
B00005JLEX|5.0|With all the garbage reality shows that keep coming out of the woodwork- the Bachelor, Who wants to marry my dad?, Survivor, Extreme Makeovers...yada yada yada. It seems like every week a new \\"reality\\" TV show is coming on. Thank goodness for Seinfeld. I watch it every weekday when I get out of my job and when the DVD comes out I will surely buy them so I can watch it whenever I want. These 4 characters are hilarious-- people who don't like it really don't realize what it's really about...4 neurotic people put into hilariously funny situations. I think that's better than any show...ever!
B0001QNFXW|5.0|When I first heard this band back in '94, I was \\"who are this guys who gave funk a twist of jazz?\\", great music, ideal for relaxing and dancing, the bass is incredible so is their harmony. The 90's was a very dry era for music. Few bands will be remembered for their brilliant contribution to music. Is very likely that if you have 2 cd's from this band you will buy it no matter what, but if you have only one, TRY IT!!, you will be attracted by the way these guys enjoy the music they developed, Jamiroquai music is for happy people, and their sound is unique.
B000002868|5.0|Many Weather Report fans praise the band's later Jaco Pastorius (bass player) years as being their best. I disagree completely!  <br /> <br />Weather Report's earliest years of experimental and groundbreaking jazz-fusion, when Mirislov Vituous was the bass player, were the most creative years for Weather Report. The band's later and more popular material like \\"Birdland\\"...yawn..is really the bland pop jazz you can hear on any EZ Listening/Lite Jazz radio stations. <br /> <br />\\"Weather Report\\", the first album, is a masterpeice. My favorite cut is \\"Morning Lake\\", a Vituous composition that is just beautiful. But all the tracks are excellent. When first released, this album was acclaimed as one of the best jazz debut albums of all time. This 25 year old album is not just a classic but it's really viable-living music that is both beautiful and always extremely interesting. <br /> <br />
B000000H66|5.0|Bernard, <br />I read the rest of your reviews to confirm what I suspected. Your reviews are an attempt to stir up debate. While I know the irony of me responding to your hateful review,I had to let you know that I got the joke. Your one star reviews of almost EVERY classic band that's influence is undeniable are so obvious. You should try being a little more covert if you want to argue (for the sake of).  <br />For the record \\"Symbolic\\" is a metal masterpiece. Taste is taste and I like the flavor. <br /> <br />P.S. Bernard if I am WRONG,I think your taste sucks!;)
B000003493|5.0|If you want some of the great one hit wonder garage rock classics from the psychedelic 60's at a reasonable price on one CD than this is the place to go. These songs are lost gems. Lo-fi psychedelic magic is just waiting to envelope you! If you like 60's rock, than this is a great buy.
B000148KK2|5.0|In the past I've purchased a couple of Diana Krall albums but never really got into them. They sounded perfect in a way but also very dry and unemotional. But her new album is outstanding. It feels more genuine to her and her capabilities. I understand there may be some people who don't like change and have expressed their displeasure at Diana not doing what THEY want her to do, but in my opinion this new album is change for the good. It is an excellent \\"audiophile\\" recording as well. I know a lot of audiophiles have liked Diana Krall albums in the past and now I'm a fan too. Whereas in the psat I may have used a Diana Krall album to test out an audio system, now I'll listen to it because I really enjoy the music. I hope she contiues to pursue her own path.
B000021XS0|5.0|Jon Petruci, Jon Mi Yung,Mike Portnoy and James Labrie are the greatest musicians of all time. The production on this album is beyond amazing, in fact the only album i can think of that is even close to the production of this is Nine Inch Nails masterpice Fragile produced by Trent Reznor. This is my favorite album ever and needs to be a part of every ones collection.
B0000028UK|5.0|I always find it hard for some reason to review albums I love. Well, since Pearl Jam's \\"Vs.\\" is my second-favorite album of all time (my favorite being Nirvana's \\"In Utero\\") this is incredibly difficult. What can I say beyond I love this album and you should too? I'm going to try my best, though. <br /> <br />This album is so great because it touches on everything, at least every emotion. There's angry songs (\\"Leash,\\" \\"Blood\\") introspective songs (\\"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter In A Small Town,\\" \\"Indifference\\") desperate songs (\\"Rearviewmirror,\\" \\"Dissident\\") and social commentary songs (\\"W.M.A.,\\" \\"Glorified G\\"). No matter what kind of mood you're in, there's a song here for you. Even if you're happy and you just want to blast something, this album is perfect, especially with the opening punch of \\"Go\\" and \\"Animal.\\" <br /> <br />The musicianship on this album, as can be expected with Pearl Jam, is phenomenal. Mike McCready begins to really emerge as one of the most talented guitar players of his generation, and he is perfectly balanced by Stone Gossard. Dave Abruzzesse is great as well, and he really gets a chance to shine on the pounding conclusion of \\"Rearviewmirror.\\" Jeff Ament's bass always seems to underscore the music brilliantly. And of course, Eddie Vedder's vocals are top-notch. It's amazing that he could scream out songs like \\"Blood\\" and \\"Leash\\" night after night without losing his voice completely.  <br /> <br />Eddie also begins to develop as a lyricist here -- there's a radical difference between the relatively straightforward lyrics of \\"Alive\\" and the poignancy of songs like \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Elderly Woman . . .\\" There's also a cool lyrical (and musical) experiment in \\"Rats,\\" which compares the human race to the rat race, with the conclusion that the humans aren't much better than the rodents. <br /> <br />\\"Vs.\\" is a beautiful, cathartic, emotional album. It is angry, yes -- but there are several soft spots as well, with the band beginning to show theirdiversity. They made the best move possible by not coming out with another \\"Ten,\\" a move that would set the tone for the rest of their interesting career. Pearl Jam has not sold out to date, and they continue to make great records that they want to make, never pandering to critics. \\"Vs.\\" is the greatest record, and you would be well-advised to pick it up and experience it.
B000002ADT|5.0|I am typing this review in front of my class so they can see how to post a review online at Amazon.  Needless to say, this is one of the cornerstones of jazz for all time and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.  I will go into more detail later when I am not trying to conduct class.
B000000OQY|5.0|With all the hype over one in a million song which was over done considering all the hate rap anthems out there towards whites, this album is my favorite. Even thou Axl was sporting NWA hats and \\"I'm a lesbian\\" t-shirts after the tabloids called him a racist. They just don't understand where he was coming from but i guess Axl wrote it for all of us that do understand where he was coming from on that song. The whole album is classic the remake of Crazy and the killer song Patience. What a album.......
B0002IQHY8|5.0|This new album from Alan Parsons brings new air to his work, and comes with a bag full of new experimental sounds to get into Electronica workspace.<br /><br />A must have!
B000000OQF|5.0|The greatest rock n roll band ever to grace the stage! Axl ruled the stage of whiteboy rock n roll and still does!
B000078DOI|5.0|One thing people have neglected to mention about this album is how great the remaster is.  The original had a very flat 1980s rock equalization that did nothing for the guitar work or the outstanding rhythm section, as well as using WAY too much echo on Anthony's voice.  The remaster has turned up the dynamics big time and the result is something more like Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  It sounds SO much better.  So much so, I'd consider buying a copy EVEN if you already have it on CD and VINYL like I do. <br /> <br />Somebody kidnap this album's producer and make him redo all the grunge albums from the late 80s and early 90s.  I can only wonder what magic he could do with Ten, My Brother the Cow, Uncle Anesthesia or Louder than Love...
B000000P17|4.0|This album never really got the attention from the public, thats why i think its a cult classic. I love this album, Down on the Farm is my favorite on this disc. To bad it was the last of the band.
0060254920|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child and now that I have a \\"wild thing\\" of my own I can't imagine not owning this book.  This is a must have story for all children's libraries in the home.  It's the epitome of \\"imagination gone amok\\" and just how important it is to use your imagination.  I love Maurice Sendak's stories and they always have an overall ending theme that home is where you are safe, warm and loved.  From a thirty something Wild thing to the little wild things on the horizon...share this wonderful story of rebellion, imagination and strength of character.  While the illustrations may seem scary for little ones, they are easily talked over and explained.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Boo hoo all the this and that where the hell is the new GNR album? Plus why wasn't \\"one in a million\\" on the Cd? What a great song if you understood where Axl was coming from..
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE Strokes fan, so this is way biased. Also, if you hate The Strokes, than this album won't change your opinion, because it's vintage Strokes. The best way to review for me is to break it down, so here it is: <br /> <br />Whatever Happened?: Great opener, the short guitar riff sounds like an instant classic, it has that timeless quality that makes you think it's been around forever. You wonder why somebody didn't come up wit it earlier. <br /> <br />Reptilia: One of the best songs they've ever done. It's a pure energy track that will get you pumped. This is the Definition of rock and roll. 2nd favorite song. <br /> <br />Automatic Stop:  The sleeper track. It is really an awesome track. This is the first track we hear Nick's synth-guitar sound, and luckily not the last. See next track. <br /> <br />12:51: The best song on here, and that's saying something. Nick's synth-guitar hook is the catchiest thing you'll ever hear. It stil hasn't left my head, and I'm glad. <br /> <br />You Talk Way Too Much: This sounds the most like something off their first album, and you can't go wrong there. Julian's vocals are really good. <br /> <br />Between Love and Hate: Upon first listen of this album, this track stood out. It doesn't have as much depth than the other songs, but it's catchy and fun. You won't find me skipping over this track. (or any of them for that matter) <br /> <br />Meet Me in the Bathroom: One of my favorite songs. The sad guitar hook is emotional, like a feeling of loneliness. Like I said, it's one of my favorite tracks. <br /> <br />Under Control:  This song gets a lot of attention, and there's a reason. It has the best lyrics Julian's ever written. The words to this somewhat ballad reek of failure in a relationship, and simply put is one of the best/saddest songs they've ever done. Wow is all I can say. <br /> <br />The Way it Is: Sounds like nothing else on the album. This is maybe the weakest track, but it is still awesome. This song should not be overlooked or taken lightly, it would be the best song on most other albums out there. <br /> <br />The End Has No End: They pick up where they left off here, what a great song. The hook during the chorus reminds me strongly of Sweet Child O' Mine.  It's their third and final single off of the album, and no one can argue with that decision. <br /> <br />I Can't Win: Maybe the other sleeper. This is probably my 3rd favorite song behind \\"12:51\\" and \\"Reptilia\\". It's also the perfect way to end an incredible album. Everyday I am on the edge of my seat waiting for their third album, and I don't know how much longer I can stand it. <br />
B000059T00|5.0|This is one of those classics that is well known and populat but never said in the same breath as disraeli gears or the band.  it should be. the album is a clear stepping stone between cream and clapton's later project derek and the dominos.   <br /> <br />can't find my way home is an elegantly understated majestic and pastoral song with steve winwood's most rousing and angelic vocals. had to cry today and sea of joy are two wonderful rock songs, which add fire to the rock riff (already rather dated by 1969) and do what you like has a great jam with two of the best solos heard by clapton or winwood on record - very psychedelic.  presence of the lord has a great clapton vocal (i belive his first great vocal) and a brilliant hendrix inspired solo. sea of joy has great violin breaks by rick grech and well alright is a winwood vehicle - great piano solo but the weakest on the album. <br /> <br />all in all a very good album. oh and did i forget to mention - ginger baker's drumming is incredible throughout - great timekeeping and imaginative fills all over the place.  <br /> <br />shame about the new cover but then, to be honest, the old one wasn't really that great was it? - and a bit odd considering all.    i would urge you to get the vinyl original though - for some reason nearly all early clapton stuff (till mid-70s) is not as good on cd.  especially cream - which loses the great rhythm tracks on stereo and more or less all their original verve on cd. <br /> <br />give it a whirl along with wheels of fire and layla for a full-on clapton experience from this era
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album is great. I liked her first album but this one takes you away. She explores more deeper rock sound. I think it fits her well. <br />Best Songs: <br />Take Me Away (Should be a single, this is my fave song) <br />Together <br />Don't Tell Me (1st Single) <br />How Does It Feel <br />My Happy Ending (2nd Single) <br />Nobody's Home (3rd Single)  <br />Forgotten (This beat is awesome) <br />Who Knows <br />Slipped Away (talks of her grandfather passing.Very deep. <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie, if you could call this garbage that, is a fine example of liberal lies and spins of the ultimate degree! This is the most extreme one sided, tainted , hateful, biased , set of bald faced lies and misrepresentations ever made. Anyone that beleives this as truth is a very sick and with our soldiers dying overseas to protect us from the battle being here, it is ashame. Michael Moore is scum beyond description.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|LET IT BE has generated more controversey than any other Beatles album. What many people expected this to be was GET BACK, the original name for the album and accompanying film, which was deliberately loose and un-organized (as the sessions actually were; listen to the \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc for more info on that). This is NOT GET BACK. This is a professional product, with all the rough part smoothed out. In some ways, it suffers in comparison to the original album (\\"Get Back\\" has no improv at the end, and Lennon's remarks are eliminated from the album altogether.) Still, the arrangements have benefitted the album. <br /> <br />\\"Let It Be\\" sounds much more interesting, taking away Spector's echo effects on the cymbals and the repeated verse at the end. \\"Across The Universe\\" is much more beautiful the second time around, with the track sped up and the choirs gone, leaving a subtle, acoustic performance from Lennon. \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is also a marked improvement, this time with none of the pompous orchestrations that made it sappy. While I have my gripes about it (I think the guitar in the song is a bit unnecessary), it is still better than the original. <br /> <br />The other tracks have been left alone, although there is a professional sound to it that the original lacked. While that may make it bad for some, I'd keep in mind that the Beatles' true last album, ABBEY ROAD, sounds just as cared for and meticuously produced, and it is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd say that this is worth the money, and it is a definite improvement on the original.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|In 1995 an album titled Jagged Little Pill under Madonna's then-new fledgling label, Maverick Records, managed to make pop history. A collection of raw rock ditties put together by a little-know artist by the name of Alanis Morrisette broke records and launched a platform for every female artist. Not coincidentally the Lilith Fair era was on the rise back then, because music audiences started paying attention to female singer songwriters from a folk / rock category, which was predominantly testosterone-filled arena.<br /><br />Almost a decade later, this phenomenon has faded, not because of lack of material or emerging artists, but because of an underlying sexist factor. It's not easy to have a strong woman signed to a label. Sinead O'Conner, anyone?<br /><br />Artists such as Joan Osborne and Alana Davis have been dropped from their label. Natalie Merchant and Tracy Chapman have both been mistreated by their companies. Both Fiona Apple and Sarah McLachlan took an immensely long hiatus. And the rise of Rap and Hip Hop left everybody wondering what the next big things is.<br /><br />Of course, in true music biz fashion, the moguls created more package-ready and compact pretty versions of what was earthy and not so manufactured artists.<br /><br />This spans everyone from the awfully bland Michelle Branch to the more recent tragedy FeFe Dobson. However, the most successfully one of that bunch has to be faux-punk Avril Lavigne - The bigwig's way of cashing into teenage rebellion by avoiding the pretty counter-Britney.<br /><br />Let Go, her first album, annoyed everyone with the drag-along \\"Complicated\\" only partially rising with \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and then \\"Losing Grip.\\" Offering boring balladry in \\"I'm With You\\" along the way. With those songs she tapped into the heart of every girl and boy who are furious for not wanting to do their homework, thus collecting money and some ill-conceived recognition from critics.<br /><br />Under My Skin is the second round for this wide-eyed little Barbie punk. The album's glossy booklet demonstrates her undying effort at making herself look tough. Avril already scored a hit the mundane \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and now gaining swift success with the slightly brighter \\"My Happy Ending.\\" Other than the video magic, Avril sifts through this hapless release with a great mush of rock songs that are destined to temporarily spark a kid's interest and then disappear as a funny period of pop culture, kind of like the powers rangers. There is no difference between, say, \\"Fall To Pieces,\\" \\"Take Me Away\\" and the closing track \\"Slipped Away.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nobody's Home\\" and \\"Forgotten\\" are apt for Avril fans - both songs of bubblegum anguish.<br /><br />This is not to say that Lavigne won't be a favorite with MTV still and have a growing catalogue of hits, but she has yet to prove that she is an individual artist with a profound talent other than the physical and musical tweaking of industry masterminds.<br /><br />If Sid Vicious knew that punk would come to this, he wouldn't have bothered.e album's glossy booklet demonstrates her undying effort at making herself look tough.

B00000DC7J|5.0|\\"Tango: Zero Hour\\" is, according to Piazzola himself, his masterpiece. This album is second to none in passion and musicianship. Listening to \\"Contrabajisimo\\" and \\"Concierto Para Quinteto\\" and not shedding one single tear is a certificate of one's total lack of emotions.
1559408855|1.0|total trash rubbish...if you fancy eating human feces this is the movie for you. im sorry but im a music and film collector with the most sophisticated taste and I do appreciate or \\"dig\\" even the most incomprehensible stuff but this was just awful. I tried hunting down this movie after hearing all the controversy and finally i got one but to my surprise it was all junk. i suggest for all those who are spending so much money to watch the movie, save your energy and money get Caligula instead. This movie is just TERRIBLE!!!
B000002UA0|4.0|\\"Flaming\\" is a nice addition. Actually almost anything from that era would have been a nice addition however, what idiot decided to get rid of \\"See Emily Play\\" the quintessential song on the original album? I deducted a star for that. There's plenty of room for it. How insensitive can you get. Having aired my gripe this is a great album. Sid's music stands up nicely even though the recording is a bit raw compared to today's tech. Really groundbreaking. Better than almost any other over ground music from that era or culture or whatever you want to call it. Really captures the essence of the aesthetic. A way under rated disk.

WHY WOULD A LINKKIN PARK FAN REVIEW A CD HE DOESN'T EVEN LISTEN TOO? HE'S A ROCK FAN NOT A RAP FAN, HE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE REVIEWING THIS ALBUM. HE'S JUST A RAP HATER. <br /> <br />but if you haven't got this soundtrack, buy it.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|Ignore the one star reviews, because obviously those people have never watched a single Star Trek (1966-1969) episode in their lives. Let's not confuse the lame technobabble of \\"Next Generation\\" with the humor, adventure, and flying jump kicks of Star Trek. <br /> <br />Oh and, in case you weren't aware, the Enterprise went outside the galaxy all the time during Star Trek (1966-69). And surprise, the rocks were fake! Big deal.  <br /> <br />So, to all you people giving this movie a 1 star rating, I bet $5 dollars you've never watched \\"Star Trek\\" (1966-1969) in your entire life... the Enterprise can't reach the barrier at the center of the galaxy, says who? <br />
B00020HEL6|5.0|There's not much I can say that hasn't been said before by other reviewers here.  This young gal was blessed with a voice and sense of style and delivery that adult singers twice her age only can aspire to.  As good as this CD is, I look forward to more from Renee Olstead in a few years, because if maturity brings a new dimension to her voice, then it's going to be a great gift to her listeners.
B0000027RL|5.0|`Ten' is, quite simply put, the finest and most complete album EVER. <br /> <br />Ok, let's start with the inevitable comparisons.  Nirvana?  Where are they now?  Admittedly Dave Grohl is an absolute genius and a legend (mainly from his `after nirvana' projects though) but Nirvana was Kurt Cobain!!  How can you compare lyrics like `what else can I say, everyone is gay' to `my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything'?  You can't!  Eddie Vedder is a poet, a lyrical genius.  Ok, they had long hair, they had guitarists and drummers - so are Nirvana therefore comparable to Avril Lavigne?  Then we have the Seattle thing - `The Corrs' (or `The Bores') hail from the same land as the illustrious `Thin Lizzy' (pioneers of rock) - do I hear comparisons?  I rest my case. <br /> <br />Now that we've got that over with let's get back to `Ten'. <br /> <br />Most of the previous comments refer to the indisputable musical quality of the album but the qualities that stand out for me are the lyrics and the raw emotions that we hear from Vedder in every song.  It's like every song is based on a deep personal experience of his, not just words that have to be sung as with the majority of bands over the past 20 years.  I first bought this album on cassette back in '92 when I was 12, then updated to CD a few years later which wore out after a couple of years so I had to buy it again.  My collection is empty without this one.  It's like an addiction - I need my fix every couple of months!  This is the one album that has stood the test of time for me and I don't envisage ever tiring of it.  Every time I take it out it seems to get better and better for me and, while the first half was my favourite for a few years, each half seem to take turns at being my favourite.   <br /> <br />`Alive' started out being a personal experience of Eddies and sharply became the first of the `Mamason' trilogy - in my opinion `once' being the best.  I just love the simple but haunting appendage of `you think I got my eyes closed but I'm looking at you the whole f**king time'.  `Even flow' represents the swift demise of a homeless man into insanity.  `Why go' - Grunge?  Come on!!!  I see bands trying to emulate this every week on Kerrang but with no success.  `Black' is possibly the most moving song ever written.  Lie in bed, turn off the light, turn up the volume and let it take you away - I dare you to tell me you're not moved.  Every line strikes a chord with anyone who's ever experienced loss and it's impossible not to feel his pain when he sings lines like `tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll ever be...'.  He captures the seemingly endless feeling of emptiness when love is lost.  Of the second half, I think `deep' is my favourite.  In my opinion it's probably the most underrated song on the album - maybe people have difficulties getting past the first excellent half of the CD, falsely believing that the second half couldn't possibly be as remarkable.  `Deep' tackles the three difficult issues of drug addiction, suicide and rape (in my interpretation) and the mindset of the people who do such things.  In the third verse especially, Vedder captures the mood perfectly; `she doesn't like the view... but he sinks himself deep'. <br /> <br />`Ten' still manages to blow me away every time.  For those of you who wish to make such obtuse comments as to compare Pearl Jam to minor players like `Creed', `StainD', `Puddle of Mud', etc; that's ok, I know you don't know any better but I'm sure you'll learn.  Let's see where those other artists will be in ten, twenty years!  `Ten' has already been hailed as a masterpiece by most of those in the know.  I don't really care for critics but in this case they're spot on - `Ten' will still be sitting in or beside my CD player in 20 years and that's the best accolade I can bestow it. <br />
6301966562|4.0|I remember sitting in my bedroom on the floor as a kid eating snacks and reading comics, when this movie came on Tv i  slowly turned my attention to it as i zoned out on it's cool techie romantic story line, also being a heavy listener of electroinic music, i fell in love with the movie and have not seen it since then. i truly feel that every time i compose or spin elctronic music i am sure this is one my influences, yes please release this movie on DVD, but i guess until then i will settle for the VHS version.
B00023BM20|4.0|Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal, Hearts Of Atlantis) and Nicole Kidman (Dogville, Birthday Girl) deliver yet again more explosive and powerful performances to their list. Ed Harris (The Rock, The Hours) delivers a ferocious and in your face role and Gary Sinise (Snake Eyes, The Big Bounce) is just fine. Wentworth Miller (Dinotopia, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) who portraits Hopkins in younger form does his best as well. Despite some moments of lulls this movie sends the goods with its rich characterizations and atmosphere. Though everyone in the god awful earth should know its difficult to adapt a novel into a script...derrr..idiots. Finely directed and it extremely pulls you in. Also starring Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) and Clark Gregg (We Were Soldiers).
B00003CXCT|5.0|As a huge Star Wars fan (club member), this box set is a long time coming. For those that can't stand the added footage/scenes... you make a point, it's well taken. The magic of DVD is the ability to foward right past a scene you don't want to watch. Push that button when you watch at your buddies house (you know you will). <br /> <br />If the fact that the original movies are gone forever bothers you, just think what the Statue of Liberty thinks. Technology happens. Deal with it. <br /> <br />A majority of fans are going to buy this box set. They've been waiting over a decade to. Jar Jar Binks could be on the cover, and I'd still buy it.
B00000I3JO|5.0|It's not so much that Hats or A Walk Across the Rooftops compete with each other for which is the best that the Blue Nile has released, but that they compliment each other in the richness with which they evoke heartfelt dreams, hope, fear, memory, and the passage of time. <br /> <br />Another must for anyone who longs, aspires, loves, or feels.  An astonishing accomplishment I'd compare to the best of Sigur Ros, Roxy Music, or Hooverphonic.  An underregarded masterpiece.
B0000C7PRY|3.0|First, the pros. This CD is filled with great harmonies and great musicianship (Mike Portnoy on drums, nuff said). There are times that you can listen and wonder why this style is not more popular with music fans. Being a music fan I couldn't give this CD less than 3 stars (although i wanted too)  <br />The cons. Unless you are in church, there is no need to want to listen to the religious non-sense. Being a fan of Spock's Beard, this is a departure. Alice Cooper is a very religious person, but he doesn't drive it down your throat. Neal, most of us don't give a crap if you go to church on Sunday (or anyday for that matter) I did see the live show for this record and I think it was the first show that I fell asleep at. If you want this style of music, get yourself a spock's beard record.
B00000I3JM|5.0|Every song on this album is rich in mood and moment, capturing the angst of modern life, work, romance, solitude, and longing in smokey vocals and layered melodies of a quality approached only perhaps by the dreamy sounds of Roxy Music's Avalon.    A must for every music lover who appreciates the evocations of the heart.
B00008PW2D|5.0|The most disappointing thing about it was that it was so short.  Now that I have had time for distance, I can forgive that.  It is a warm, sweet reflective season.  I don't know if it is as exciting as other seasons, it is still really, really good.  I highly recommend the DVD but do lament the price charged for it.
B000023VR6|5.0|Nowadays all these rappers is goin' around talkin' about all the weed they smoke and the people they shoot on the streets and all the women they have sex with. That's all s***. They just sit around with fake cigarettes and toy guns and have to make out with body pillows. And even if they do all this s*** for real, who's the one who taught 'em? Without Dre, none of these rappers would have the stomach to rap about all this s***. Dre's album 2001 continues the legacy that his '92 release The Chronic began. He is the original gangsta rapper, and with Snoop Dogg and Em working alongside him there's no way this guy can lose. He's an awesome beatmaker and can rap way better than most other rappers. With hits like \\"Next Episode\\", \\"Forgot About Dre\\" and \\"Still D.R.E.\\", it's a win-win situation for him. Although many would argue that The Chronic is his best album, 2001 gives it a run for its money. The beats are tight, Dre's flow is laid back and has that \\"I just don't give a f***\\" sound to it, and the guest appearanced are tight. Plus Dre's got his own label so rappers is comin' to him for a record deal so he can decide whether or not these wankstas get in. And with Em running Shady/Aftermath with him, probably thousands have wanted to sign with him. But their label doesn't accept wankstas, so the Shady/Aftermath family is few but great. Pick up this album if you lookin' for some real gangsta rap.

B00003CXCT|5.0|My goodness. I read these reviews for this DVD set and I could not believe the whinney-ass people griping about George Lucas and how horrible he is. All of them complaining about how he keeps changing the movies around and adding new things to them. Never find the FACT that these are his films and he's the one who MADE them to begin with. Never mind the FACT that it was HIS (...) on the line when he made the first one back in '77 that you all love so much. Never mind the FACT no one believed that the movie would be any good and he constantly had 20th Century Fox on his back. He hated the experience so much, he didn't even direct ESB and ROTJ. I think the guy deserves to get his films in the shape that HE wants them to be in. I think he loves Star Wars a far lot more than any of you cry babies. If you REALLY loved Star Wars and not your lost youth, you'd have a better time enjoying the Prequel Trilogy AND these newly revamped Original Trilogy films. All this just makes me like Star Wars even more.  The DVDs look great from what I've seen and any REAL Star Wars fan should have them.....and guess what? I bet you cry babies who gave this DVD set one and two star ratings will buy them too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|TV is often referred to as the \\"idiot box\\" the \\"Lobotomy box\\" or worse. Intelligent folks or at least folks who want to sound intelligent are always disparaging the \\"junk\\" on TV. To be sure they have a point. With the proliferartion of garbage on the box it's easy to overlook a real gem in a sea of manure.<br />Firefly is that gem.<br /><br />I never got to see the show when it was broadcast and I guess I should be thankful for that. Had I discovered it and gotten hooked only to have it yanked out from under me would have been an extreme disappointment. At least now when I bought the DVD set I knew it was finite and limited so I cherished each episode that much more.<br /><br />Firefly is the most imaginative television show ever broadcast. It was intelligent, fun, funnny, touching and poignant. The ensemble cast had to be the best fit with each other I've ever seen, and the writing, oh the writing. Any episode would have worthy of a full length motion picture, and better than 95% of the motion pictures out there.<br /><br />I watched the series on disk at a rate of one per day until the third disk. Then I stopped and went at it on per week to extend the experience until the inevitable end.<br /><br />The series is difficult to classify. Is it a Sc-Fi/Western as others have described? Maybe, but that simple description seems inadequate to understanding Firefly in all it's nuances.<br /><br />I think it is a celebration of freedom more than anything. All human desires distilled into a form that is at once entertaining and profound.<br /><br />I am not sure of FOX's motivation for even producing it to begin with since if it fulfilled it's promise it would have had to been exactly what the network claimed it was and the reaosn for cancelling it to begin with. They said it was too deep or two complex for the average viewer. Well boys, that had to be obvious before putting the first scene to film. Had that been the case the show would have never been authorized to begin with.<br /><br />So we have a mystery. No matter. It's limit is also what makes it more valuable. Enjoy each episode knowing it will end and it will make each one that much sweeter.<br /><br />Bravo to the cast the crew and to Joss Whedon for chasing a dream and bringing it to life.<br /><br />TV doesn't get any better than this.t is also what makes it more valuable.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|When it comes to sheer cinematic joy, nothing can compare to the glorious MGM musicals, and this new Warner boxed set of all three magnificent THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! films is truly the most exciting DVD release of the year.    Each of the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! films is a special viewing experience, assembled with cleverness, style and panache. They make for irresistable viewing.     As if the great compilations weren't enough, there's a bonus disc with over five hours of extras! Vintage documentaries and TV specials are mixed with some more recent material, and a great assortment of additional outtake musical numbers make for an unbeatable package.    These new DVD transfers are quite spectacular. These films have never looked so great. The quality is astounding, better than ever before on video. The colors jump off the screen at you, and how wonderful to have them enhanced for widescreen on my big 16x9 monitor. The images are spectacular. Obviously with the clips being drawn from over 200 films, some are not as breathtaking as others, but overall I was knocked out. The sound is also very, very impressive.    The glory of Garland, Astaire, Kelly, & Co. live on in this magnificent boxed set.    WARNING: Be prepared to spend several days going through the material which has been meticulously and creatively assembled. You'll love it....and you'll end up watching parts over and over again!    A superb job by Warner Bros. all the way around. Gets my vote for DVD of the year.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is not one of those biblical films that you feel good about and see famous stars in.But a film that fuels and renews your faith and makes you know what a Christian is and how it became to be.It's very brutal and shows the hostileness of those times and how hard it was to live in those times.Mel Gibson did a great job of depicting the last 12 or so hours of Jesus's life on earth.
B000001ZSF|5.0|People often link music to events in their lives, thereby forming recollections and associations. It is true to a certain extent with me too, but I find that this album is one of the best recordings of Jarre. It appears to be a seamless album but some pieces do not fit in the whole picture that nicely. For example, as far as tracks No. 3 and 4 as featured on JMJ recordings are concerned, you can find many similarities between many albums of his - the former are always slow and the latter are always joyful (even if written in a minor key, as in this album). The transitions are masterful. My favourite is Chronologie Part 6.  <br />
B0002I831S|1.0|I just bought the last of those beautifully planned 2 episode Star Trek DVDs. Could my timing be any better? I can't believe they are now putting out a full season one box set. I literally built a DVD shelf out of some old timber I had from the shed just so I could have some room for all these 2 episode Star Trek DVDs and now they come out with a nicely compacted full season of Star Trek. Yes, I have put in an order for this box set, but while I have been waiting, I have slipped into a state of depression. Don't worry, I called my doctor and help was on the way. I started on the antidepressant Celexa, but that made me vomit a lot and then I tried Lexapro, but that caused severe internal bleeding. Currently, I am on a combination of Wellbutrin (working fine so far, fingers crossed) and Zanaflex, which is a muscle relaxer, I can't even grab my Star Trek DVDs anymore without getting angry). <br />I envy the majority of you Star Trek fans out there who can actually go on with their lives knowing they will have both a complete box set as well as several 2 episode DVDs, even though they overlap. For me, I cannot cope and function properly in life knowing that I will now have \\"duplication\\" and \\"overlaptation\\" in my Star Trek collection. If it wasn't for the Wellbutrin, I would be in such a frenzy right now, that I couldn't even be able to write this. I just wished that Paramount put this box set out instead of the other 2 episode DVDs so I wouldn't have to go on feeling like this.
B00005JN2F|4.0|There has been a trend lately for sequels to be better than the original films. Lord of the Rings springs to mind, but Spiderman 2 and the Matrix series all seemed to improve as the story progressed.<br />I was really looking forward to the Bounrne Supremacy. Based on the trailer at apple.com I was ready for a spectacular film.<br /><br />In many ways I was not disappointed, but the film fell short of the first. Mainly I think due to director Greengrass's style.<br /><br />Yes the action was fast and furious but somehow the story line got short-shrifted and a little lost in the cacaphony.<br /><br />I liked the way Doug Liman drew the story and the mystery while at the same time building the chemistry between Bourne and Marie.<br /><br />Greengrass opted for a more breakneck pace and way excessive use of the hand-held camera. I don't mind the and-held camera but tis movie was like watching \\"The Shield\\" on cocaine.<br /><br />Damon again excelled in the role of Jason Bourne and played it exactly thee way a die-ard fan of the Ludlum series would expect.<br /><br />The supporting case was likewise excellent and I enjoyed seeing Julia Stiles back as Nikki, Joan Allen was well cast as the the CIA agent hunting Bourne and Brian Cox practically stole every scene back as bad-guy Abbot. I was even happy to see snippets of Chris Cooper in flashbacks.<br /><br />Overall I loved the film but I think keeping Liman behind the camera would have given us a tighter story, more continuity and a little less motion sickness.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Rowling's wonderful book was magical in itself. What but magic could have made so many American kids (among others) pick up a book willingly and read it?<br /><br />Everything came together (or was brought together) just right for ths film. I understand that Rowling demanded artistic control, to make sure her story survived as well as it could, and it did. The casting was great. Alan Rickman made Snape into something that can never be repeated. Hermione, Ron, the professors - all brilliant matches of person to role. Even Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was wonderful. I knew, because as soon as I saw him on screen, I just wanted to smack him.<br /><br />There's just so much here for a tween-age kid that I'm amazed all over again. All the adults are way too big, every experience is new, all kinds of wonderful secrets are being exposed, and there are still way too many rules.<br /><br />Most of all, the effects are a) pervasive and b) unobtrusive. The amount of computed imagery is just mind-numbing. Still, almost all of it looks natural and well tuned to the live action.<br /><br />Buying the DVD costs about as much as seeing a first-run movie twice these days. If you watch this twice (and you will), you break even if you buy it. If you watch it more (and you will), you're ahead of the game.<br /><br />Go for it. Get yourself one of the best kids' movies ever. You deserve it.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0001LYH98|3.0|This is a newly remastered version of a 1999 release with five bonus tracks, mostly b-sides and demos. Unlike most of Bowie's recent releases, this is mostly mid-tempo and pretty straight forward. There are 4 very strong songs (Thursday's Child, Something in the Air, Seven, The Pretty Things are Going to Hell) and the rest is sort of average. Worth buying if you can find it for a good price.
B00006AW2M|2.0|The Rolling Rip-offs! After reading a review of someone here stating this album is as good or better than Sgt Pepper, I just had to laugh. This album is as good as Pink Floyds debut (Pipers at the Gates)from this same year, but certainly not Pepper. . The song In Another Land tries to capture the atmosphere of John's Lucy in teh Sky. It's really pretty pathetic. This album does have two decent tracks. She's a Rainbow and 2000 Light Years From Home.<br /><br />It is well known that Mick used to come to the Beatles sessions and John had to ask him to stop showing up all time. Trying to steal ideas no doubt. The production is pretty bad as well. All in all, the Beatles are better than the Stones. Sgt Pepper will forever be \\"THE\\" album of all-time.
0312979479|5.0|without a doubt the best BOOK written. The plot is unbelievable- she is without a doubt the best mytery writer. This book is about 10 strangers sent to an island along with a cook and his wife. But then their host UNKNOWN(hint hint) is missing. Soon a murder takes place and one by one heads start to roll-not literally. The clue to who the criminal is this: He/she who's not dead must be the criminal. At first i knew who the criminal was, but then i changed my mind, why? Because Agatha Christie is as cunnning as a fox. A book for ages to come
B000066F6H|5.0|I've listened to the CD a few times now and like it more and more.  I absolutely do not regret buying this CD.  But beware, if you like your rock \\"without the edge\\" then this CD is not for you.  It's racous, in your face and has attitude.  Melodic it's not.  Garage rock seems like a pretty good description. <br />Personally, I find the White Stripes (referred to in another review) too tame and more commercially oriented.  I guess that's the difference here. <br />
0345457684|5.0|VERY stylish. Probably could have been fleshed out a bit more-there were a few logical jumps which I didn't even really see coming in hindsight, so the mystery component was a bit weak, but it just flows so well as a story. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />I can't seem to find my copy anywhere in my house anymore, so I feel kind of silly.
0671015206|5.0|This was one of the first financial planning books I bought, and with each additional financial book I read I can always trace its wisdom to something stated in the Millionaire Next Door.  Being frugal and saving isn't always about depriving yourself of the finer things.  I bought a 2000 Navigator for more than $30,000 less than I would have bought it new.  It still runs like new and has all of the bells and whistles that I like except for the Navigation system.  So instead of going to Best Buy and buying one for $1200, I went to ebay and bought the one I wanted for $400.  Now that is saving and being frugal but also enjoying life and its finer things.  I have plenty of more stories like these after I decided to enjoy life and the finer things without breaking my bank account.  Being frugal is simply making better financial decisions.  This is what the authors were stressing.  With each time I listen to the audio book I get more enlightened.  I am well on my way to being the Millionaire Next Door and enjoying life in the process.

6300273199|5.0|Are you guys at the record company waiting for the 30th year anniversary of Mr. Scott's Death to release this masterpiece on DVD format? GIVE US A BREAK !!!
6305291446|5.0|The series has gone through many blows, and although I liked 4 & 5, many fans will state that the franchise was dead by part 2...until now.  I think after the HUGE failure of Halloween 6, both with fans and normal viewers, Mustapha Akkad decided to go back to the basics to make a decent film.  This new installment brings back what we loved from the first film and updates it with its own \\"style\\" which ulitimately makes it a great sequel. <br /> <br />As it turns out, Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) isn't dead, she's actually a dean in California!  What's more, she's now got a son, John (Josh Hartnett) to go along with her life!  After an old counselor of Strode's is killed, Michael discovers that his sister isn't dead and exactly where she lives.  On the weekend that Michael arrives, the school Laurie works for is on a class trip and the only remaining people are her, John, and some of his friends and staff which makes a classic setting for a refresher in becoming the scared babysitter all over again!  When Laurie first comes face to face with Michael she almost thinks it's her mind playing tricks on her, but it quickly becomes much more real and horrifying from the moment she finds that he is no delusion! <br /> <br />This movie re-vamped the \\"formula\\" to making a successful slasher film and even brought back some aspects of a successful Halloween film and the result was incredible.  The storyline is tight, no holes, and simple, which keeps it very close to the original.  The use of music and shadows also bring back a sense of boogeyman in Michael and having the hole campus empty gave plenty of room to be realistic!  The body count is quite low, but again that's what made this movie better!  Jamie Lee Curtis comes back after 20 years and proves that she's still got what it takes to be crowned the \\"scream queen\\" of horror.  Additional cast members also help bring this movie to life with modern idols like Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams, and my personal favorite: L.L. Cool J!  This movie took what they'd done in the past, updated it, and made a sequel that is worthy of being compared to the original. <br /> <br />The DVD is a decent collector's edition, but we've been spoiled in the past by films that we knew little about, and unfortunately H20 got plenty of press coverage.  It's got a fun featurette, but nothing that compares to the behind the scenes work for the original or parts 4 & 5.  The movie itself is presented in widescreen with surround sound which preserves that cold chill I felt in the theatre when I went to see it (and I'm not talking about the air conditioning)!  Fans of the series don't need to be told at this point to pick this up and horror fans can honestly get away with this and the original for your collection.  All around movie fans may want to rent first as this is still a \\"slasher\\" film.

B000002KET|3.0|So says the Master of Sabbath, Tony Iommi, regarding \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\\"  Of course, he's right.  It's very experimental and not really heavy metal. <br /> <br />For years I wouldn't even buy it because of the cover because I don't dig all the pseudo-Satanic dreck.  I also don't like the title of the painting, \\"The Rape Of Christ.\\"  However, when taken in context with the back cover, it makes a little more sense, especially given that \\"The Exorcist\\" was so big at the time.  One star off for the cover, though. <br /> <br />This album is regarded by many as \\"Sabbath's finest hour\\" (of course, many say that about any Sabbath album Ozzy \\"sang\\" on).  I wouldn't say that, but I would say that it's a cross between brave experimentation and drug-addled aimlessness (this album contains some of Geezer's most impenetrable lyrics).  The production (by Tony Iommi, credited to the band) is good and some of the songs are good, some less so, and the playing by the three instrumentalists (abetted by Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman, though on what tracks I don't know) is good. <br /> <br />\\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" - This is the most typical heavy Sabbath song on the album and the strongest cut.  Quite heavy, though Iommi throws in some nice acoustic interludes.  Excellent guitar solo.  Ozzy in this day and age is unable to \\"sing\\" the high-register final verses and the current Sharon Osbourne Hits, Ltd., version of Sabbath restricts these verses to an instrumental.  To hear them sung really well, check out Tony Martin's rendition on \\"Cross Purposes Live\\". <br /> <br />\\"A National Acrobat\\" - Well constructed, less heavy than the title cut.  Incomprehensible lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Fluff\\" - Exactly what it says!  Acoustic fluff!  Tony plays all the instruments here.  I can discern acoustic guitar, classical guitar, cleanly-played electric guitar, steel guitar and piano.  As has been noted, kind of has a \\"music box\\" flavour.  The band used a recording of this as their live \\"outro\\" during the Ronnie James Dio years. <br /> <br />\\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" - Clever title, Geezer, but doesn't fit the song.  Almost poppy, with Ozzy singing about his current lady love.  Wakeman's (?) keyboards are quite prominent. <br /> <br />\\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" - The most straightforward track on the disc besides the title track.  Basic rock but not quite heavy metal.  Lyrically recounts Sabbath's troubles with the music business.  Obligatory drug promotion as Ozzy wheezes \\"Smoke it...Get High!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Who Are You?\\" - Other than \\"The Wizard,\\" the only known instance of Ozzy \\"playing\\" an instrument (he does the one-fingered synthesiser melody).  Very strange song with Ozzy hurling invective at a deity - not sure if it's God or Satan.  Good orchestral-type ending though. <br /> <br />\\"Looking For Today\\" - Again, almost poppy.  I think this is the only time I've heard handclaps on a Sabbath song!  Well-written and structured (Bill Ward's percussion is outstanding) but again not very heavy. <br /> <br />\\"Spiral Architect\\" - \\"Epic\\" type of song that gets a bit too grandiose at times.  I think this is supposed to be about God deciding who is created and who isn't...again, must be the drugs talking.  Overdubbed audience applause toward the end. <br /> <br />The band are to be commended for experimentation but really they went too far with it on this album and would continue to do so for the remainder of the Ozzy era, remaining more than a bit directionless (costing another star) until the Dio-powered comeback in 1980. <br /> <br />The cover alone is probably responsible for much of the goofy satanic stuff inflicted by the likes of Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, Venom et al in the ensuing years. <br /> <br />Not a bad album, but certainly not as great as some make it out to be.  Of course, it sells by the tankload just because Ozzy is on it.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Metallica is a tad rough around the edges; that is the reason they are a Blastin' Metal Band; song lyrics actually say something.(this is example of some groups lyrics - Beat the drum, over let me hear the drum, Beat the drum over let me hear the drum and on and on and on\\"  The lyrics though dark, touch of evil in Hetfield's voice-- they sound great and look even better! This DVD collection can keep you mesmerized totally in the METAL ZONE, the orchestra is another fabulous contribution. <br />EX. \\"Hi, this is Mom. What ARE you listening to?\\".  You reply, \\"Oh, it is a new DVD of mine. It is the San Francisco Orchestra; Mom, my music appreciation has definitely reached a higher level.\\"  \\"This is wonderful; we must go to the opera very soon, you are destined to be enchanted by the opera.\\"  YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN AFTER THE OPERA!!! <br />Honestly, it is great great.

B0002IU988|4.0|***4.5 Stars***For those of you who like real rock and roll, this the cd for you. Formed from the remains of Creed with new lead singer Myles Kennedy, Alter bridge brings a unique mix of hard and powerful rock with some great mellow tracks that are very reminiscent of bands such as Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, STP, Creed, and Audioslave. I consider myslef a fan of \\"real\\" rock and roll and I was pleasantly surprised after listening to this record. The entire record is listenable, But there are about 5 stand out tracks that are just flat out awesome. I haven't been this impressed with a new rock band since Audioslave last year. If you consider yourself a fan of rock and roll of any kind, don't miss the chance to pick up this record and give it a try. Trust me, you won't be dissappointed.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Special edition, special special edition. It doesn't really matter. Those complaining have seen it 20+ times so they can't really be getting confused. When star wars first ran on HBO i was 15 and managed to get my viewing count up to the mid 30s. ESB and ROJ weren't far behind. I had the toys, i had the cards, yada yada yada. I loved them then. I love them now. If they've been tweaked a little here and there, it just gives it a bit of a bump to make me more likely to spend yet another 7+ hours watching them. I like the  prequels (not nearly as much as the originals but they're ok). PLus, why are there 900 reviews for DVDs that haven't come out yet? If you don't like the fact that george keeps rereleasing them, don't buy them. It doesn't change the fact you liked the originals. But now, due to the magic of digitalness, you'll be able to watch your favorite scenes over and over without having to wait for the vcr to rewind. Yea! And as to the special bonus never-before-heard behind the scenes stuff. How can there be anything new to say about the making of these movies. Sure, I'll watch them and probably enjoy it a whole bunch, however, we've been watch star wars behind the scenes specials for over 20 years. I guess what I'm saying is, if you like em, great, if you don't, don't buy em. Star Wars really doesn't need to be something to argue over or to get upset about \\"changing\\". The movies get 5 stars but really nobody needs to see Amazon's ranking to assess whether they want these DVDs. Mr. Lucas, here's another wad of cash from me. Your movies have easily provided me with enough entertainment to be worth it. Thanks.
0767824571|4.0|What is your favorite color? I don't know mine. But, I do know that I nearly died laughing when I first saw this. But, is the grail eventually found. They spend the whole movie looking for it and they never find it. How ironic is that! It took me a while to get some of it though. My favorite is the swallow. I mean, what does a swallow have to do the grail? Although, they could have worked on the ending a little bit. No one likes the ending! Each Scene had me on aching. The french really was the the top dog. That and the bloody rabbit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, this is by far their best. I've just got one question. HAS ANYONE SEEN THE GRAIL?
0694003611|5.0|Not only is it a great \\"story\\", a nice poem, bedtime-related, and child-friendly, with great illustrations. The cadence and flow of it are purrrrfect for putting (and slowing) a little one down. It starts offbeat, falls into a sing-songy pattern, and the breaks out as the first half ends: \\"a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady whispering hush\\". Gorgeous, and works wonders! Every house with a child needs two copies - and every house without a child needs at least one.
B0002DB52M|5.0|DOGVILLE is unlike almost any film you will see.  Writer Director Lars von Trier once again has dared to pry open the truths concealed by conventional facades to examine the human condition, the plight of human survival in a world populated by intimidated individuals who only define their public identity by affiliating/identifying with the Norm.  In so many ways this story with a Prologue and Nine Chapters is a morality play ad as such it is piercingly poignant and superbly constructed.  This film is a minimalist film: the 'sets' are diagrammed lines on the floor, the props are spare, the action all taking lace on a sound stage that appears like a Joseph Cornell box.<br /><br />The Depression Years in America, a time of gangsters, poverty and minimal communication of world events to the tiny towns on the Midwest. Dogville is a rural small town in the Midwest peopled by what appear to be good folk.  Into this scene enters a beautiful girl on the run Grace (a luminous Nicole Kidman) who seems to be in flight from gangsters.  The town's philosopher Tom (Paul Bettany in an extraordinary performance) finds Grace, hides her in the town's mineshaft (over the door is the inscription 'Speak the Truth'...), and convinces the townsfolk to harbor her.  In exchange for this kindness Grace must do some work for each of them everyday as a gesture of good will.  When the police come looking for Grace later, the townsfolk still protect her but the price is doubling the amount of work she must do in reparation. Slowly this town of kind appearing folk become wary of Grace, start lies about her, abuse her sexually and physically, and eventually fetter her as their prisoner. Tom advises her to address the townsfolk with the whole truth of how the individuals in the town, quite apart form acting as a group,  have been secretly treating her: the truth will make you free sort of confession.  From that point the story turns and the ending is so very powerful that even hinting at the last chapter would rob the audience of the incredible impact.<br /><br />von Trier has gathered a cast of brilliant actors: in addition to Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany, the cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgard, Chloe Sevigny, Harriet Andersson, James Caan, Phil Baker Hall, Jeremy Davies, and the eloquent off stage narrator John Hurt.  Despite the length of the film (close to three hours) the tension never lapses.  The only true criticism of the film is some very unnecessarily choppy editing.  The musical score is haunting and the final credits (von Trier tastefully opens his film with no credits at all) are presented with many of the photographs of Dorothea Lange from her Depression Series, and photographs by other artists who show the effects of poverty throughout the world.  It leaves you breathless.  This film is a triumph, it calls for your involvement as a viewer, and it has lessons about morality and the individual's plight in an angry world. Highly Recommended.chapter would rob the audience of the incredible impact. <br /> <br />von Trier has gathered a cast of brilliant actors: in addition to Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany, the cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgard, Chloe Sevigny, Harriet Andersson, James Caan, Phil Baker Hall, Jeremy Davies, and the eloquent off stage narrator John Hurt.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am not a Britney fan but I have liked certain songs here and there of hers as they've been released.....I bought this CD solely for the song \\"Everytime,\\" which I just love--a haunting & beautiful ballad. I was pleasantly surprised to put in the CD and find two or three other great songs in addition to that! \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Brave New Girl\\" are both very pretty songs.  <br /> <br />In general, I wish these young singers who start out doing straight pop wouldn't always end up doing rap/danceclub stuff. It gets really old.  <br />But this CD is going into my must-haves case. <br /> <br />
B0001LJCPC|3.0|It doesnt have some of the best songs including: <br />-when budd catches the bride <br />-when pai mei fights the bride
B00005JMAH|5.0|I love the movie. Yes, I think a lot of things were cut, but JKR approves of it, so obviously what was cut was not essential to the overarching storyline for the seven books. <br /> <br />That said, I do think that some explanation of the map and Harry's Patronus should have been in there. It felt disjointed that Lupin would ask Harry if Harry realized the map would be a device to lead Sirius straight to him. I mean, having read the books we know that Lupin and Sirius know the passwords because they helped create the damn thing, but for the movie there is nothing that explains why Lupin knows the passwords to the map. <br /> <br />And Mooney. They misspelled his name. Parvati Patil's last name is misspelled in the credits as Patel so I watched in the IMAX viewing and saw that Seamus Finnigan's last name is misspelled as well as Finnegan -- which is a mistake I almost always make. <br /> <br />Ships... I am a diehard Trioshipper I now realize. Though I believe that Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny will be in the books, I believe in Menage and pumpkins. That said, there were some quite amusing Ron/Hermione moments as well as Harry/Hermione moments. I also enjoyed the contrast of Draco being a drama queen to Pansy with Ron overdramatizing his leg to Hermione. But I don't think the Ron/Hermione moments overshadowed the Harry/Hermione moments or vice versa. The two relationships are very different. Ron/Hermione is conflict for the most part (at least at 13) and Harry/Hermione is emotional, especially when Harry talks about Sirius while they're waiting for themselves to exit the Whomping Willow. <br /> <br />But the trio hug goes without saying as a great testament to their friendship. They're 13 here, I'm not giving them a mnage a trois... yet. <br /> <br />Scenes I loved...&lt;ul>&lt;li>it tore my heart to hear Harry speak so longingly about leaving the Dursleys and living with Sirius \\"in the country\\" because he's been trapped inside Azkaban for 12 years and know that it'snever going to happen because Sirius is dead&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>I noted the playground in the background when Harry ran away and all I could think about was him sitting on those swings in OotP. Getting ahead of myself, aren't I?&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>the scene in which Harry is standing behind the clock watching everyone leave for the second Hogsmeade weekend made my dark!Harry radar perk up. Man, the plot bunnies just that shot could generate&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>Harry riding Buckbeak. While the shot across the lake did make me immediately think of Titanic, it has also been pointed out that it's the first time we really see Harry enjoying himself -- he loves flying&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>snarky!Harry at the Dursleys. \\"Yes.\\" Sorry, anticipating OotP again&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>on the Knight Bus when Stan asks if Harry has heard of You-Know-Who and Harry spits back, \\"Yeah, him I've heard of.\\" Oh man that gave me chills. Someone said to me that Dan Radcliffe could have either made that line or botched it. He slamdunked that line&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>the scenes with Harry and Lupin. Not so much the bridge (though that did seem to imply to me there was Remus/Lily in the past), but the post-Boggart on the steps when Harry talks about his happy memory. He doesn't have that many happy memories and for him to not know if the one that generates at least a partial Patronus is real or not is just heart-wrenching as well&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Continuity...&lt;ul>&lt;li>when did the Whomping Willow move between CoS and PoA? In CoS it was in the middle of a grassy courtyard&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>in Divination, when Trelawney sets Neville's teacup down she puts it in the saucer, yet when Neville reaches for it, it's in the middle of the table&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>when Hagrid is skipping stones, just before they cut back to Hagrid, Harry stands up and moves toward the lake's edge, yet when they cut back to Hagrid to confess Buckbeak's death sentence, Harry is sitting. Mind you, I don't normally note these types of errors&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Things I loved...&lt;ul>&lt;li>Sir Cadogan&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>Ron's nightmare (\\"You tell those spiders, Ron\\")&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>Ron being confused by time-travelling Hermione (\\"Where did she come from?\\")&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>Buckbeak (just wow)&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>the soundtrack (I listened to it tonight and there were some scenes I could picture from beginning to end just by the music)&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>the Dementors&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>the entry into Gryffindor Tower in which Seamus and Harry are talking about the Fat Lady's inability to sing (and the ghost goes right through Dean)&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>the \\"party\\" with butterbeer bottles and candy everywhere (I adored this scene... it showed them being boys)&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>twinspeak&lt;/li> <br />&lt;li>David Thewlis' and Gary Oldman's performances. I really doubted either one could do the roles justice but I have happily been proven utterly wrong. Thewlis is amazing in how understated he plays Remus, striking just the right balance, I think. And Oldman is just... wow. I never really \\"got\\" either character and some people's love for them until now&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>About the Firebolt... I didn't mind this change. In fact, I hadn't even realized the fight with Hermione was missing until the end of the movie when the Firebolt arrived. <br /> <br />Ron didn't get Pigwidgeon, though, because the Trio didn't leave on the train.
B00026W82U|4.0|This band takes time to write well crafted, sedate, meditative songs, synthesizing such influences as Simon and Garfunkel, Prefab Sprout, and Astrud Gilberto. With a whispering, plaintive voice, the vocalist breathes lightly over mostly acoustic guitar arrangements with easy-listing bossa nova beat. The result is a second album that's easy to listen to, very atmospheric, and very thoughtful. So why only four stars? Like the first album, this one doesn't get much play because there's a sameness and a monotony to the songs. Still, if you want to bliss out for an hour, it's hard to do better. If you like blissing out to slow, melancholy songs, you might also check out Just for a Day by Slowdive and the albums of Mojave 3.
0312263120|2.0|Compared to his other three books that I have read (Deception Point, The DaVinci Code, and Angels & Demons), this book falls short of my expectations.<br /><br />The main character of this book, Susan Fletcher, is introduced as an exceedingly intelligent, technically brilliant cryptographer who is called in to her work at the NSA to investigate a cipher that the NSA has been unable to break.<br /><br />While the description of what the environment behind the closed doors at the NSA might be like was interesting, the discussion about the science of cryptography itself was a bit disappointing. One of the key reasons that breaking encryption is hard is that, for certain types of problems, it doesn't get much easier to solve when you increase the number of processers crunching away at the solution. The central technology device of this book, a computer with millions of processors, was put to work \\"breaking\\" ciphers by performing a search for the key with which they were encrypted.<br /><br />This is known as a brute force attack, and it does not scale well against even the cryptographic ciphers in use today. Brown is either misunderstanding or glossing over the fact that these brute force attacks are computationally \\"impossible.\\" That is to say, there will never be enough computers in the world to perform a brute force key search for keys as large as those mentioned in the book in a reasonable amount of time. Modern cryptography focuses on more interesting things like finding things like weaknesses in the chaining mechanism by which a cipher is applied repeatedly to a string of text. I find it amusing and disappointing that Brown's idea of what's going on behind the doors at the NSA is simply an absurdly powerful computer running at blinding speed, yet executing a primitive and doomed attempt at breaking a cipher.<br /><br />The cryptographic ideas in this book are rather weak, and perhaps that is the reason that most of the action centers around David Becker, a professor sent by Fletcher's boss to Spain to try to get the \\"key\\" to this impossible cipher from the man who wrote it. The best parts of this book -- the cat and mouse game between the professor and the assassin -- can also be found in Angels and Demons, and in my opinion, they are much more refined and well written in that book.<br /><br />The book is not bad, but it is not in the same league as his other novels.professor sent by Fletcher's boss to Spain to try to get the \\"key\\" to this impossible cipher from the man who wrote it.

B00005B36H|1.0|I really didnt mind tool up to this point, so i thought rather than make this review sound like hatemail, i'd try and constructively criticise this garbage. I also thought with this review i'd offer something that none of you  tool worshippers have seemed to notice.... <br /> <br />Maynard no longer sounds like Maynard. His voice has lost something. I saw the video for parabola having never heard the song b4 and thought it was the butterfly effect. And parabola is by far the best song on the cd, i think most ppl who've heard the cd would agree with me on that.  <br /> <br />So first of, tool have lost thier distinctiveness. If you ignore the fact that they make thier songs drag out over 10 mins and maynard pens lyrics that all but the most dedicated tools cant be bothered tryin to decipher, lateralus is just you're average heavy metal cd.  <br /> <br />Except that,bar parabola, none of the songs on this cd really have any hooks or melody. You tools might call it selling out if they did write some catchy songs, but i just call it good music. Its not that tool cant write catchy songs (prison sex,sober,stinkist,aenema etc) its just that they've either run out of ideas, or they simply cant b bothered anymore cause they know they can rely on thier idiotic fans not to notice and praise this piece of crap for absoultely no reason. nuff said
B000060P79|1.0|Listening to this band it always makes me wonder which poser band is more gay. Simple Plan, or Good Charlotte. It's a very heated race. SP's singer sounds like he's in a boy band, the song topics are all aimed for pre-teen girls. What really annoys me is the token bald guy in the band. Does anyone care about him? I for one don't. That is why you are being ripped off if you buy this crap.
B0000564KH|5.0|This album is by the first listen a noisy peace of crap, but after hearing it the seccond time the melodies and the lyrics creep under your skin and light up hidden places in your subconsciousness and thereby earns it's title: \\"Darklands\\". It has helped me through many hard times and it's a must own. Buy it and sit down with a few drinks and hear it 3 times, while reading the lyrics... The melodies have a way of sticking to places in your sole you never realized you had and bring them up to surface.
0671027387|4.0|I have read four of Dan Brown's novels now: The DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress, and Deception Point. Of the four, The DaVinci Code is my favorite, but this comes in a close second.<br /><br />Typical to all of his novels, the main characters in this book are constantly thrown into situations out of which there is no obvious escape, and they manage to save themselves by quick thinking and MacGuyver-like ingenuity.<br /><br />Dan Brown always chooses some well-defined academic category into which to immerse his plot. For Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code, this was the idea of secret societies and what secret they might be guarding (The Illuminati in A&D, and The Priory of Sion in TDC). For Digital Fortress, he chose the science of cryptography, and for Deception Point, the plot is woven around the natural sciences related to meteorites.<br /><br />In Angels and Demons, and in The DaVinci Code, the main character is Robert Langdon, who doesn't necessarily have a lot of technical expertise in the central subject matter of the novel, but the reader is carried along with him as he learns about it from supporting characters and informational resources woven into the plotline.<br /><br />In Digital Fortress, the main character is described as already possessing a great deal of technical expertise in the central subject matter, cryptography. This departure from the style of guiding the reader through the learning process with the main character was something of a disappointment to me in Digital Fortress. Having taken courses in cryptography and being a computer programmer, it would have been quite interesting to me to see how he explored the subject from a learning point of view. However, in Digital Fortress, the main character is imbued with the technical knowledge from the outset, and her qualifications in this matter are described to great length, then subsequently ignored in the plot.<br /><br />In Deception Point, thankfully, Brown uses the approach of taking the reader along with the main character as she learns about the various sciences and technologies that surround the plot.<br /><br />The writing style is clear, and the detailed descriptions of the technologies and sciences surrounding the plot made me want to go find some textbooks on the subject and learn some more.<br /><br />The genre-typical habit of conducting several narratives simultaneously, divided into chapter segments which end on a cliffhanger, is well executed and makes it difficult to put the book down at the end of a chapter.<br /><br />The reason I give this four stars instead of five is this: I read this book last of the four Dan Brown books I have read, and certain plot elements are starting to seem a bit formulaic. Still, the predictability of certain plot devices does not detract much from the enjoyability of this book.the approach of taking the reader along with the main character as she learns about the various sciences and technologies that surround the plot. <br /> <br />The writing style is clear, and the detailed descriptions of the technologies and sciences surrounding the plot made me want to go find some textbooks on the subject and learn some more. <br /> <br />The genre-typical habit of conducting several narratives simultaneously, divided into chapter segments which end on a cliffhanger, is well executed and makes it difficult to put the book down at the end of a chapter. <br /> <br />The reason I give this four stars instead of five is this: I read this book last of the four Dan Brown books I have read, and certain plot elements are starting to seem a bit formulaic.

B00008ADPF|1.0|How this band got popular is beyond me. All the songs sound exactly the same and Chad Kroeger may possibly have the most annoying voice in the world. This band defines so many terms perfectly. Boring, Generic, Bored to Death (you'll wanna die after a minute or two) lame...etc. All come to mind when I think of this. I can see why Fear Factory, Deicide, Type O Negative Cynic, and all the other smart bands left Roadrunner. I wouldn't want to be in the same building as Nickelback, much less associated with them. Finally, no I'm not just saying that cause I'm an ignorant American and hate Canada. If you wanna support Canada at least buy something that deserves to be popular like Devin Townsend.
B000002572|5.0|Not only is Boston's self-titled debut the biggest selling debut album of all time but it's also one of the best classic rock albums ever released. Like other timeless albums such as Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and The Eagles' Hotel California, Boston plays like a greatest hits album as nearly every track here still gets regular airplay on classic rock radio.<br /><br />Every song here is top notch featuring memorable melodies, excellent harmonies, and stellar musicianship. The most well known track here is \\"More Than A Feeling\\" which not only became a Top 5 hit but is also one of the greatest songs in rock history. Like Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", you recognize it immediately upon its acoustic guitar intro. The track \\"Hitch A Ride\\" continues in the same vein starting out as a soft ballad before gaining momentum during the solos. Bandleader Tom Scholz's solo during the song's outro is outstanding proving he's not only an excellent songwriter and producer but a great guitarist as well. \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\", which was a Top 20 hit, is also an outstanding track featuring a long organ solo from Scholz over the underrated rhythm section of bassist Fran Sheehan and drummer Sib Hashain before going into its memorable organ hook. The rockers \\"Something About You\\" and \\"Rock N' Roll Band\\" literally jump out of your speakers and still sound great nearly 30 years later. \\"Smokin'\\" is also a great track with its shuffle beat and organ solos from Scholz. Other great tracks here include \\"Peace Of Mind\\" and the closer \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight.\\" Also worth noting is that while Scholz gets most of the credit for Boston's success, it's Brad Delp's vocals which truly bring these songs to life as his performance is on par with the best and more publicized vocalists of this era such as Journey's Steve Perry and Queen's Freddie Mercury. Boston is a timeless album that should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Be careful by the Amazon review, its not great.  This movie felt like it ended without any real ending.  It didn't seem to flow well and everytime a kid does something REALLY stupid...well you just say why you so friggin stupid.

B000286RNY|4.0|We saw the US version of Shaolin Soccer in the theater several months ago and really enjoyed it.  At that time, the US version was not yet available on DVD, so we purchased the Chinese version.  The Chinese version is a bit more violent and less funny.  The English sub-titles are a little off as well. <br /> <br />Having just viewed the US version on DVD, we can confirm that it is the same version we enjoyed in the theater with better sub-titles than the Chinese version. <br /> <br />The movie really rates 5 stars for fun, but we dropped a star because it's not exactly Academy Award material.
B00006RINF|5.0|My friend clued me into LC. The first time I had heard them was on MTV and I was so completly blown away. I love Evanesence but this group has taken everything to a new height. I wish I could go to the ozzfest to see them. I may not have the cd yet but im definity getting them all.
B000002G87|5.0|The interplay between Clapton and Duane Allman is simply exquisite.  It seems as if they were born to play guitar together.  This is especially true on the magical piece \\"Little Wing\\".  Allman's death in a 1971 motorcycle accident is a tragedy.  I can only imagine what another co-contribution by these two guitar Gods would have been.  One of my all time favourite albums in all of my 49 years on this planet.

B000089RVX|5.0|I heard bring me to life on the radio in my car last year and I thought \\"man this girl got pipes\\" i haven't heard anyone sing like that before.  I got home and had to find out who was singing this song, I found out it was Amy Lee of Evanescence.  I decided to get \\"Fallen\\" and it is the best CD I ever got.  The only artists that impressed me this much were Linkin Park but Lp and Eva can't be compared.  I love the whole Cd, it is a piece of art to me and I can't wait to hear the next album.  This Cd definitely deserves the 5 stars.  The music is amazing, you have choirs, you have strings, you have the piano, you have the rock and then you have Amy Lee's voice which soars over the music.  \\"Fallen\\" is a must have, you will not regret getting this cd.
B0000AUHPB|2.0|I absolutely loved the remake -- partly because I'm very fond of those very sexy Minis -- so I was looking forward to watching the original, but this one's a bust. The movie drags, the superb actor Michael Caine comes across as oafish, the comedy comes across as inexplicable, and even the car chase scenes leave you wanting. In short, this one's worth skipping. Watch the new one if you've any interest in good car chases, reasonably interesting dialogue, or even a plot that makes sense.
B00000DD2D|4.0|I've always been a bit sceptical about these superstar collaborations...they don't always work too well, and sometimes the guest stars overshadow the supposed main artist. But Jimmy Rogers and his various all-star combos manage to pull it off really well.    Sure, the arrangements are generally very similar all the way through, which does perhaps detract a little bit from an otherwise fine performance, but this is actually a very accessible and fun blues record. It doesn't just appeal to hard-core blues fans, more mainstream rock- and R&B lovers can certainly enjoy it as well, and Rogers and his guest musicians have hand-picked some real blues classics, and they generally do very well by them.    The album opens with a faithful take on Muddy Waters' \\"Blow Wind Blow\\", with excellent harmonica by the Fabulous Thunderbirds' Kim Wilson, and lead guitar by white blues-rock guitarist Jeff Healy.  Jimmy Rogers' own \\"Blues All Day Long\\" has Rogers sharing lead vocals with a certain Mr Eric Clapton, who also plays lead guitar. Carey Bell lends a hand on the harp.  On a gritty reading of the classic \\"Trouble No More\\", Rogers shares the lead vocals with Mick Jagger, and Keith Richards plays lead guitar.  \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is another Jimmy Rogers-original, with Taj Mahal behind the microphone (he is also featured on Rogers' \\"Ludella\\"), and Lowell Fulson appears along with harpist Carey Bell on Memphis Slim's \\"Everyday I Have The Blues\\".    The all-stars also do the inevitable take on Robert Johnson's \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\", with Stephen Stills (!) contributing lead guitar and co-lead vocals, and Stills pops up again on Big Maceo Merriweather's \\"Worried Life Blues\\".  Mick Jagger can't quite match Sonny Boy Williamson II on \\"Don't Start Me To Talkin'\\" (Keith Richards plays lead guitar again), but \\"Goin' Away Baby\\" is pretty well suited to his voice, and Eric Clapton and Jimmy Rogers do a fine rendition of Rogers' \\"That's All Right\\".    The album closes with an alternative rendition of John Lee Hooker's \\"Boom Boom\\" (retitled \\"Gonna Shoot You Right Down\\"), with - get this - Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page on guitars, and Robert Plant sharing lead vocal duties with Jimmy Rogers!  Rogers himself is in fine voice throughout, in spite of the fact that he was in his seventies at the time, and died before the album was released. The near-legendary blues- and R&B pianist Johnnie Johnson's dextrous playing belies his age. And finally, as a special treat for Hound Dog Taylor-nostalgics, the swivel chair is occupied by none other than the Houserockers' 66-year old drummer Ted Harvey.    Definitely recommended.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|Well, live & learn.  I received the 30th Anniversary set today, and a thoroughly enjoyable day of watching later, I have to say - they got it RIGHT this time.  This is the 5th version of the landmark BBC series \\"The World At War\\" that I've owned:  I originally had it an episode here or there, taped off TV in the early days of home video - then, I splurged and bought them all - on single episode Beta tapes...(grin)... then, when it was rereleased on Laserdisc, I \\"upgraded\\".  Boy, I thought I'd reached the pinnacle then... but when it was offered as a neat box set on VHS, I dropped a Benjamin Franklin on the set courtesy of a sale at a local dealer.  Then, what I thought was the pinnacle of video presentation - the DVD box set.  Boy, that was a pain - the first version of this series on DVD (still offered on Amazon) had frustratingly annoying menus - you couldn't play \\"all\\" episodes on a disc - you were forced to play each episode singly - and they were two-sided - a real drawback to uninterrupted play, especially in a DVD changer.  And, for some weird reason, the discs frequently locked up at random intervals, in all three of my DVD players... (*sigh*)... still, it WAS the \\"World At War\\"...  so, when the \\"30th Anniversary\\" edition was offered here, I bit one last time.  What a delight - the discs (eleven of them!) are single sided.  The menu offers \\"play all\\" (yahoo!!).  And the audio and video is perfect - or at least as perfect as a 30 year old series composed of 60 year old footage is likely to be.  And between Jeremy Isaac's brilliant composition, and Laurence Olivier's masterful narration, you simply couldn't ask for a better documentary on World War II.  And why eleven discs?  Because the set now includes a whopping dozen \\"bonus\\" documentaries - everything from interviews with Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary) to wonderful \\"Making Of\\" discussions of the series itself.  Really, I only had one quibble - there's no closed captioning offered.  It would have come inhandy in spots, especially when you're straining your ears to understand Polish or Russian or German place or person names - additionally made difficult by Oliver's beautifully modulated but clipped British narration.  Aside from that - well, after 5 tries, I really think I have finally found the 'perfect' version of this series for home viewing... of course, let's talk again in a decade or so, when yet another video format knocks DVD into the dustbin where my beloved Beta and Laserdiscs lay...(grin)...
B00006879E|5.0|This is a really great cd. Believe me, I'm not at all into pop music, but this cd is great for just being by yourself in the car and singing away. I don't think I would really classify it as pop other than the fact that it does appeal to a broad audience like \\"Popular\\" music. Its chill without being depressing and its up beat without be obnoxious. Its just....awesome.
B00008S2VG|4.0|this is just O.K.  I feel that i can speak freely because of the fact that i am a huge fan.  i went to the Re-Invention tour twice for pete's sake.  This album seems remote, like Madonna forgot to add more of her soul to it.  There are excellent tracks like \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"Love Profusion\\" yet it doesn't quite hit the pitch that she had with the albums Ray of Light and Music.  Mirwais' sound, her french co-songwriter and producer on both this and Music, sounds almost stale.  I dont doubt that with her next album she will pull another musical trick from up her sleeve and everything will be right in this Madonna fan's life.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|There are very few sequels that match up to their Predessossors! Yet again, there are but a handful that better the same. This is one of them. From start to finish, it just keeps getting better and better. Keeping up to the spirit of the original, and at the same time being individualistic in its own right. \\"X2\\" can safely be put in the same league as The Godfather II and The Empire Strikes Back. Worth owning and worth watching a million times over a million generations.

0743454529|5.0|I am a huge fan of Picoult and when I was finally able to find this book, I settled right into the writing that I was so familiar with. Picoult has the ability to draw you in and not let go till the end. I loved the set-up of this book, with each character having a chapter, it allowed you to become familiar with each of them on a different level. The way it all tied together was just amazing and I thought that Campbell and Julia could have been in their own novel. What a good read...What's next Jodi?

B000274THQ|5.0|This German film represents to me the constant question of what European movies by the likes of Fellini, Truffaut, Renoir and Bergman have that American movies don't which make these movies seem so much better than many American movies, while lacking many niceties sported by Hollywood movies which make them shine with a surface quality the European films lack. Why else would we bother to watch these flicks while keeping one eye on the action and another on the subtitles.<br /><br />Fortunately, I know German, so I could keep both eyes on the action, checking the subtitles occasionally to check the accuracy of the translation. While not perfectly literal, it was a good translation into colloquial English, with even the occasional curse word properly translated, although there was rarely anything stronger than the German `Sheise'. The movie's `R' rating is a total mystery to me. There is some very brief nudity and sex, but hardly any language 13 year olds have not already heard aplenty. My best explanation for it is that the setting of the brief incidents is so believable that it may have a much stronger impact on a young viewer than sex or violence in an implausibly plotted Hollywood product. This is like `Lord of the Rings' receiving a PG-13 for `epic battle sequences and story images'.<br /><br />There is little suspense in the story as much of it is summarized on the back of the jewel case, so I have no qualms in outlining it here. The story is all about a family of four living in East Berlin. In 1979, the doctor father leaves an East German family, nominally to live with a girlfriend in West Germany after leaving the East to attend a medical convention in Dusseldorf. The shock of the seeming abandonment sends the mother into a catatonia. After treatment at an East German sanitarium, she returns filled with zeal and idealism about East German socialism, vigorously following this path for eight years until 1989, when she has a heart attack upon seeing her son being arrested in a protest march against the Berlin wall. The attack is not treated as quickly as it should have been, so the mother remains in a coma for eight months. In this time, the East German communist party dissolves the Berlin wall is demolished and East and West Berlin and East and West Germany become one country. At this point, the mother awakes from her coma and doctors say she can experience no shocks, as they would probably drive her to a relapse. Since the son believes that hearing of the fall of the GDR (East Germany) would probably be such a shock, he insists on taking his mother home and editing everything she sees and hears with the help of a colleague who is a budding television producer. The chum gets old television newsreels and the two of them create new ones in a makeshift studio. One new newsreel has to be created when the mother sees a giant Coca-Cola banner on the wall of a tall building just outside their window. The cover story is that the poor giant Atlanta company had to have help from a large East German bottler to make their European bottling quotas. A second, more elaborate ruse must be constructed when the mother manages to wander out onto the street filled with western autos and, of all things, IKEA ads for `Billy' bookshelves on kiosks. The story is complicated by the sister's involvement with a West German and the drunken former principal at her school and mercenary former students bribed into singing for the mother in East German Pioneer scarves. The resolution with the family's father is something of a surprise, as is the resolution of the ruse about the East German regime.<br /><br />There is certainly a lot of intentional humor in this movie, but it is really hard to call it a comedy. One of the most subtly funny moments was the `quote' from Fellini's `La Dolce Vita' where the mother sees the top half of a statue of Lenin being hauled off to some ignominious fate by a low flying helicopter. Writers and Director Wolfgang Becker replaced Fellini's statue of Christ with a statue of Lenin, leaving the viewer to make the connection. There are no gags and there is plenty of emotional pain and pathos, although the ending is logical and satisfying. The acting by the cast totally unknown to American experience is uniformly terrific. The other side of the coin is that it has the typically European lack of Hollywood veneer on its production values. The editing and direction are all good, but there are virtually no subtle touches in set decoration, set design, or cinematography. But, the story is so good, you hardly miss them.<br /><br />The packaging proudly proclaims that the movie won 15 German and European film awards and was nominated for best foreign film by both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. I must look up the winner of those awards, as a film better than this one would be something to see.<br /><br />As long as you have some taste for foreign films with subtitles, or know German, this movie will reward your watching it. Unlike a very select few foreign films like `La Femme Nikita' and `Run, Lola, Run', the movie may not have the kind of energy to overcome an aversion to subtitles, but I recommend it anyway. The version I saw in letterbox format had all subtitles below the film in the lower black bar, so there was absolutely no problem reading them, if you need them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.cker replaced Fellini's statue of Christ with a statue of Lenin, leaving the viewer to make the connection.

0385474547|5.0|This book is amazing. The writing style of this book may seem flat and dull as you read it, but remember what this book is trying to accomplish. It is telling a different side of the story of one that we are all so familiar with: The \\"freeing\\" and \\"culturing\\" of the world. Appropriatly titled, Things Fall Apart discribes the life of a well respected man in Niger and his tribe and how when the beliefs of the tribe are overturned, the society not only dies, but goes mad as well.  <br /> <br />Okonkwo is a man that had a worthless father, a \\"woman\\" (a man who had acheived no titles). And his entire life Okonkwo has been struggling to be everything that his father was not. <br /> <br />The tribe is so deeply rooted in their beliefs that the society has no evil in their eyes. Okonkwo may beat his children, a hanus crime in our society, but think of what these people believe in. <br /> <br />The most startling aspect of this book is when Okonkwo's gun explodes at a funeral, killing another person. While this is not murder, he does not for an instant plead his case, he packs up and exiles himself for 7 years for the good of the tribe. Now this may not seem like a huge punishment, but now he must crawl up the ladder of society all over again to his near god-like status he had once acheived.  <br />This book was an amazing glimpse of life in Africa and so much more. It is a story of beliefs and religeon and how much the mean to the world.

0440238609|4.0|Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is a remarkably ambitious and carefully constructed fantasy, and it's highly readable: as they say, a rattling good yarn. Still, big claims have been made for it by many readers, and Pullman himself makes his ambitions as a mythologist and cosmographer clear, with his fondness for epigraphs from Milton's _Paradise Lost_ and from Blake's Prophetic Books. Perhaps as a response I find myself strangely disappointed with the series, since the incredibly rich fantasy world of the books ends up squashed between, on the one hand, a standard-issue the-fate-of-the-universe-is-hanging-by-a-thread adventure story, and on the other, a fair bit of preachiness.  <br /> <br />I suppose I can't complain at how much of-its-time the books seem now, even though they were written so recently, in the 1990s. The series' preoccupations and themes include: quantum physics; chaos theory; many-universes theories; panpsychism; global warming and pollution; traditional healing and herbology; shamanism; mental illness and depression; witches as wise and benificent rather than evil figures; angels (gay angels, even); a virulent hostility to organized religion (with the church portrayed as an insanely self-righteous, authoritarian institution, with a particular fondness for abusing children while claiming to do them good); a matching suspicion of technology and science as embodying power without concern for ethics. Still, Pullman can be very crude and schematic in the exposition of these themes: e.g. here's a sample bit of dialogue (admittedly an untypically bad passage): <br /> <br />\\"When I first saw you, in your Oxford,\\" Lyra said, \\"you said one of the reasons you became a scientist was that you wouldn't have to think about good and evil. Did you think about them when you were a nun?\\" <br />\\"Hmm. No. But I knew what I _should_ think: it was whatever the Church taught me to think. And when I did science, I had to think about other things altogether. So I never had to think about them for myself at all.\\" <br />&c <br /> <br />The other problem is that Pullman's inventiveness as a fantasist - marvellous things like the carefully worked out idea of a world where everyone has a \\"daemon\\" (animal-shaped familiar), like an embodied soul; or the eerie wraith-haunted cite of Citagazze - is not matched by an inventiveness in plotting. The novels are far too reliant on a quick succession of cliffhangers, and there's a distressing tendency to have another character step in unannounced at the last second to save the heroes or otherwise advance the plot. A lot of the dependence on fortunate coincidence and eleventh-hour rescues is papered over by the implication that much of the action is directed by Fate, but it's hard not to feel this is a nice way of giving weight to what's really the novelist's convenience. (Similarly for Pullman's habit of killing off characters the moment their function in the plot is done: there's a particularly bloody pileup at the end of book 2, _The Subtle Knife_.) There are also some weak points in the plotting: e.g. in book 3, the inexplicable stupidity of the powerful angelic Regent Metatron. <br /> <br />But ultimately the most serious problem is that, between the pellmell plotting and overarching \\"serious\\" concerns, the characters are pancake-flat. The most interesting is surely Mrs Coulter, who is genuinely evil and yet turns out curiously sympathetic (presumably this is in part Pullman's homage to Milton's portrait of Satan). But Lyra and especially Will don't have much depth: both of them are given a slightly one-noted fixation on a loved one (Lyra's friend Roger, & Will's mother) and are likeable enough, but they're otherwise generic examples of pluckiness & determination. You'd have thought that Pullman would have noticed that one of the significant achievements of his beloved Milton was the delineation of character: Satan, the various rebel angels, and Eve. <br /> <br />None of this is to say the series isn't a success on its own terms: as an adventure and as a delineation of a fantasy world it's excellent. But I was hoping for more.
B000268QB2|5.0|As soon as I heard the single Somewhere Only We Know, I was amazed by Keane. They remind me of Coldplay, but I think they are much better! Their album is awesome and I can't get enough of it. Some of my favorite songs Somewhere Only We Know, Everybody's Changing, and Bedshaped. Anyone who hears the lead singers voice will fall in love with it! The combination of piano, bass, drums, and Tom Chaplins' unbelievable voice has made Keane one of my favorite bands, and I recommend that everyone give them a chance, you will not be disappointed! I have been telling everyone I know about Keane, and I listen to them constantly! I can't wait for them to tour the U.S. again, I will be sure to go see them live.
B0002858YS|5.0|Such a great CD, seriously. Most of these songs are made up of the most simplist of catchy lines and amazingly, the CD is still awesome. Personally, I'm not a very big fan of &quot;Andy, You're A Star&quot; or &quot;Believe Me, Natalie&quot;, but none the less, it's still an awesome album. It's been a while since I've heard such a great and creative debut from a group/artist. Last time I have, was back in 2001 with Michelle Branch's debut. <br />&quot;Hot Fuss&quot; has such great instrumental work on it. I'm usually not a big fan of keyboards, but this CD is full of it and it's great. I'm crazy about the bassline in &quot;Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine&quot; and the drumming in &quot;Smile Like You Mean It&quot;. I mean, they even have a choir in tracks 5 and 6...who else does that on their debut without sounding weird? NOOOO ONE!<br />As a musician myself, I really appreciate the originality of the work that went into this album. They may have only began to blow up on the charts recently with &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;, but I see a bright future for these guys (here's hoping!). <br />As a final thought I must say thank God &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; is as great as it is because it's what pushed me into buying this album. They're coming to Toronto on October 11th and I am going to fight for my tickets...haha. Seriously, I will. &gt;=)<br />Hurrah for The Killers!
B00008ADPF|4.0|This music is real. Nickelback sings about things that most people try to keep in the back of their closets. It's real without being unnecessarily explicit. It packs enough punch to make you sit up and pay attention to the lyrics, yet doesn't scare the living daylights out of you. Very good, good to play through once in a while. If you really like Nickelback, buy this CD. If you aren't sure, borrow it from someone... and play the entire CD through. Once around will be enough to tell you if you like it or not.
B000001FSR|5.0|I love this album. Tom Waits is a genius in my book. And this is one of my favorites of his. Every song shines with beauty, sadness, and the very essence of life. Each song is different yet they flow together and form a story for all time.<br /><br />  The story is about a man named Frank, and it's a rags to riches kind of story. It starts out this kid named Frank wants to go \\"Straight up to the Top\\" and he is very earnest and innocent, because you are \\"innocent when you dream,\\" and he goes on to face some of life's sadness in songs like \\"cold cold ground.\\" That is what I love about Tom Waits; that he can paint a story like this through music.<br /><br />  And what music it is! Each song has its own distinct personalty. From a calypso vibe in \\"Temptation\\" to a rooster crowing in \\" I'll be Gone,\\" to even more experimental tracks. Other highlights include \\"Yesterday is Here,\\" \\"Train Song,\\" and gosh darnit, every song! So, really, if you are looking for quality music that makes you think and feel, this is it. And if you like this album, Tom Waits has many more that are just as good, and original. A fascinating musical voyage.

If you are looking for a captivating adventure, this is the book for you. It holds you from page one, and each character, though rabbits, and other animals, is very real and defined, with various personality traits that are recognizable in humans. I see this as a fable for humans to follow in some ways on courage and perseverance, and friendship and love.<br /><br />  Good for all ages, this would be a wonderful book for a family our friends to share together.

0393307050|5.0|As a history(and military history) buff, I am a sucker for historical novels.  Master and Commander (and all of O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels) rates up there with best military history novels written by the likes of Michael and Jeffrey Shaara (Rise to Rebellion, The Glorious Cause, Gone For Soldiers, Gods and Generals, The Killer Angels, The Last Full Measure) and Gore Vidal (Burr, Lincoln, 1876).    Any reader can discern that O'Brian had a comprehensive knowledge of tall ships sailing, British naval history and the Napoleonic era. However, O'Brian's references to art, science, period medicine and then-current politics demonstrate that he had performed painstaking research in numerous disciplines to flesh out this (and his other) books.    Extremely well written, O'Brian uses several techniques that make the books more interesting to the reader than standard, straightforward prose presented in a chronologically correct manner.  He effectively uses flashbacks (principally through the entries in Mataurin's journals and Aubrey's letters), and period langauge that makes the reader think (or look up vocabulary).  If you get hooked on O'Brian's books (as I did), you will no doubt want to invest in one of the several available companion reference books (such as A Sea of Words [King]; Jack Aubrey Commands [Lavery] or Patrick O'Brian's navy [O'Neill])that help explain the numerous English words and phrases of the Naploenic era (nautical and otherwise) to 21st century readers who may be unfamiliar with them.    What makes the books especially riveting is that O'Brian used actual ships' logs and other primary historical resource documents to help him create his stories - substituting in the Jack Aubrey character for the actual Captains and officers who lived the actual (or similar) events.      Readers who fail to gain a thorough understanding about life in Nelson's navy, British warships, the men sho sailed them (from all classes) and their hard life, have only themselvesto blame.  If you read Master and Commander, you'll likely get caught up in the series as I did. Enjoy!
B00005JNEI|3.0|Politics aside, I've got problems with this as a documentary. In several instances, Moore gets lazy, asking leading question he never quite answers. Moore also is not afraid to get downright emotionally manipulative (I have the same complaint with Bowling for Columbine, which I like quite a bit.) I'm a huge fan of \\"Roger and Me\\", mainly because Moore technique fit the frame. Here, Moore never quite establishes his thesis and sort jumbles a bunch of stuff together. Yes, Bush is a weenie. But Moore doesn't cast any new light on Bush's essential weenie-ness.     I suspect when everyone's ideological ardor dies down, somewhere during President Ventura's second term, this film will be valued as an artifact of an insane period in American political life, rather than a masterpiece of documentary film making.

B00005V0X5|5.0|Most people think of Megadeth's best and think of albums like \\"Peace Sells\\" and \\"Rust in Peace\\" (which are indeed killer albums). <br />However, I believe that this album is Megadeth's best. While the production isn't very good, that's one of the things that makes this album so special. This album captures the band (Ellefson, Mustaine, Poland, Samuelson) at their raw core. From the brilliant piano in \\"Last Rites\\" to the dizzying guitar solos of \\"Looking Down the Cross\\", this album demonstrates some true creativity, which i thought was lacking in most 80's metal. This album and Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning\\" are THE essential thrash metal albums and if you're a fan of Megadeth or metal in general, I strongly reccomend this album. <br /> <br />And just in case you were wondering, \\"Mechanix\\" is basically Metallica's \\"The Four Horsemen\\", only about twice as fast and without the slower, melodic middle section.
B00006LWSF|5.0|This soundtracks is awesome, eminem has a lot of good songs on this cd, my favorite is lose yourself, how he sings about the rap battle & his life. This soundtrack has alot of good rappers on it, like 50 cent, d12, Obie Trice & Rakim. This cd rocks you should go out and get it. Also get more music from 8 mile. Good Stuff
B00008AWOG|5.0|\\"Still Life\\" really has something that the other Opeth album's don't have, though I can't quite put my finger on it. Listening to it, the sense of dynamics is amazing: the band goes from classical acoustic to some really brutal death metal in a blink of an eye and  singer Mikael kerfeldt's mellow tenor can become an enraged demon at any time. A truly great listening experience, and the imagery conveyed in the songs is great, too. <br /> <br />The Moor - 10/10 - Though clocking in at 11:28, this song really                   <br />never gets boring. A perfect example of Opeth's dynamics. Also has a haunting lead guitar part. <br /> <br />Godhead's Lament - 11/10 - The shining moment of the album and possibly Opeth's career (it give's \\"Bleak\\" some competition). Has a very powerful guitar solo and beautiful melodies before reaching its raging climax <br /> <br />Benighted - 6/10 - I don't dislike this song because it's soft (i'm a huge fan of the \\"Damnation\\" album), i just dont think it's as good as some of their other work. <br /> <br />Moonlapse Vertigo - 8.5/10 - Cool guitar riffs, fast-paced, good melody. Great song. <br /> <br />Face of Melinda - 8/10 - Now this IS a good soft song, the acoustic guitar in the background really sets the atmosphere for a very beautiful, softer piece. <br /> <br />Serentity Painted Death - 8/10 - An average Opeth song (which sets it pretty high compared to most music though). Fast, killer, brutal riffs and vox <br /> <br />White Cluster - 10/10 - Excellent closer. Rather than building up, this song's brutality is at the beginning and winds down. Haunting lyrics and chilling acoustic guitar. Incredible guitar solo.
0671027387|5.0|Since you start this book till you'll end it, is an excellent thriller, all the stories involved, the Senator Saxton, NASA, The President, The White House and of course Rachel and Michael, are different kind of thrillers that will keep you reading all the time, of course as in many books are things that you will never know if are true or not, but fantasy is always a part of reading and writing, as in the Da Vinci Code you will learn two or three things about this world and the people who handle it.
B00028HBKM|1.0|If this wouldve been a movie about an unknown person, it wouldve failed big time. This is a bloody nightmare of violence. Yes, it might reflect the heartlessness of mankind and the violence people are capable of, But it did not at all reflect the person of Jesus or bring him any closer to the audience. The stereotyped and absolutely female looking \\"satan\\" was just ridiculous and typical fundamentalisic. The cinematography and the acting was okay, but what did Gibson want to tell us with this fundamentalistic waste of celluloid? That we are cruel and nothing changed until today? Yes, look into Iraq, China and other Countries, and we know! The Message of Jesus is a Message of Love, Unity, Forgiveness and Tolerance. Something most of his followers have forgotten, praying hate and other horrible things. Now it would be time for a movie that shows all the blood that was spilled in his name. It is sad, that a movie that just projects violence and gore was such a big success in the United States and it shows the hunger for sensations and scandal. And I dont think that Jesus would like that movie at all. There wouldve been a better way to make people think than that movie, that did nothing at all to make the world a better and more loving place.
B00006LSM3|3.0|Rumor has it that George wanted a raw sound this time around, something less polished or radio friendly than \\"Cloud Nine\\" or those Wilburys albums. While Jeff Lynne worked wonders on those projects as he did for several other classic recordings, he is the last man on Earth to call in when you want to make a \\"raw\\" album. As his own recent \\"ELO\\" album made clear, Lynne does not do raw. He never has and wouldn't know how if you wrote himan instruction manual. On Harrison's swansong, what Lynne thinks is raw amounts to a timid and anemic echo of the thump-and-syrup Lynne sound. On many of these musically uninteresting and airy tunes -- \\"Any Road,\\" \\"Vatican Blues\\" and \\"Rising Sun\\" come to mind -- it is either Lynne's way or no way: songs that would have been great had Lynne been given full reign or kept out of the studio altogether. The result is often a sloppy and confused mess. I consider Harrison the soul of The Beatles, and have absolute confidence in his ability to serve up a record that is sincere, understated and immediate. But with Lynne at his side, only the divine \\"Pisces Fish\\" and \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" imply what \\"Brainwashed\\" might have been had George gone at it alone, while the moving \\"Looking For My Life\\" ranks as a very close third.<br /><br />Lynne's interference is particularly tragic here, not because the album became Harrison's epitaph, but because of how eloquent an epitaph it is. \\"I'm a pisces fish and the river runs through my soul,\\" Harrison sings, delivering one of the album's most vivid and poignant images. Much of what he has to say here suggests that as his life waned to a halt, his spiritual journey only began. Amid these tunes of long roads traveled and many more miles to go, it becomes clear that death, for George, is merely a gate swinging open upon a paved and endless road of the soul. He is as open about his mortality as he is hopeful about the new beginning it entails. \\"Had no idea that I was heading toward a state of emergency/Had no fear where I was treading/I only found it out when I was down/Upon my knees/looking for my life.\\" the precise enjambment of these lines shows that Harrison was as skilled a poet as he was a guitarist or songwriter. But where this verse broods with dark anticipation of life's greatest uncertainty, others look beyond it with wonder, confidence and wisdom: \\"There's a temple on an island/I think of all the gods and what they feel/you can only find them in the deepest silence/I got to get off this big wheel,\\" he sings on \\"Pisces Fish,\\" \\"and I'll be swimming until I find those waters.\\" But even for a man who looks death in the eyes with such intelligence and faith, still the sorrow of its finality hurts: \\"just talking tomyself crying out loud,\\" he sings on \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud,\\" \\"knowing as you leave me/I also lose my heart.\\" Musically, \\"Brainwashed\\" is hardly Harrison's finest hour. But for those interested in encountering the radiant soul of a man on the verge of a harrowing spiritual transition, this is the place to go.no fear where I was treading/I only found it out when I was down/Upon my knees/looking for my life.\\" the precise enjambment of these lines shows that Harrison was as skilled a poet as he was a guitarist or songwriter.

6303168507|4.0|Steven Spielberg on the holocaust.  Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis.  Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred.  Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity.  We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever.  Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people.  The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something.  The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat.  And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, \\"here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.\\"<br /><br />We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade.  Still I think the actual concentration camp footage seen in, for example, Sophie's Choice (1982), to which Spielberg owes something, is as effective as anything could possibly be. When I see those films, shot by the triumphant Allied forces, I am again reminded that just concluded was the most depraved and horrific episode in human history.  Nothing we have done was worse than the holocaust, although Stalin's purging of Russian society ranks a clear second. I think the fact that Spielberg filmed the whole thing in black and white and then turned it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that Schindler saved from the Nazis was an unconscious tribute to the power of those grainy, flickering shots of horror, part of the legacy of the twentieth century.  Perhaps it was a bit stagy, in the usual Spielberg style; however I have to say showing that one little Jewish girl's red dress (the only bit of color in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it again.g shots of horror, part of the legacy of the twentieth century.

1577311523|5.0|In my own book, I had the previledge of interviewing some of the best speakers in the world, including Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Brian Tracy, Barbara De Angelis, and others. Yet, as good as they are, their message was lacking something, although I couldn't quite put my finger on it. However, when I read The Power of Now, I realized what the problem was.<br /><br />While every other author/book had you DOING something, Eckhart Tolle was the first person that said just the opposite. The key to peace and serenity was learning how to do nothing... to just BE! That's it. Nothing fancy or earth shattering. And it's something that nature and animals do naturally, but we humans seem to always be busy running around DOING something or trying to get somewhere, or acheive some thing. (Sure, books on zen and meditation touch on this concept of \\"just being,\\" but often they include the concept of TIME, i.e., you have to practice for so many hours per day or even years to really see results).<br /><br />Tolle says just the opposite... that clock time is unnecessary and is itself an illusion that if you are caught up in just keeps you stuck in always striving to \\"get somewhere.\\" I.e., that most of us use the present moment as a means to an end, rather than as the goal itself. For me,reading The Power of Now and putting it to use allowed me to look at the world in a brand new way. To really focus on the moment, and know that nothing in the future could ever truly make me happier then what I had right now this very instance. Of course, it's a daily struggle to remember this, as my mind's default switch seems to be stuck on thinking about the past. So I find myself picking up Tolle's book, or listening to one of his tapes atleast once a day. The words always seem fresh and new, and never fail to bring me back into the present. I am learning to simply observe my mind rather than try to control it (yeah, good luck that one!) Some would argue that being detached removes you from life, but Tolle (and I agree with him) says that it's just the opposite. Until you learn to disconnect from your mind, you NEVER really learn to truly experience ANY moment, person, or event. All I can tell you is this is simply the best book that I have ever read and I am thankful that I discovered it, otherwise I would still be stuck in my old way of seeing the world.<br /><br />-Michael Jeffreys<br />Author, \\"Success Secrets of the Motivational Superstars\\"agree with him) says that it's just the opposite.

B000002H33|1.0|If everyone says this was Metallica's best, then that could only mean one of two things...either all of their other stuff managed to somehow be even worse, or...I should just assume that whatever mainstream America praises, assume the opposite. Metallica has to be the most overrated attempt at metal I've ever heard. If Metallica qualifies as real hardcore metal, then the 'Jetson's' must qualify as in-depth scientific analyses worthy of the Discovery channel.<br /><br />Metallica is a completely unoriginal, uninspiring, annoying, and overdone 80s cheese rock project more comparable to Whitesnake and Poison than the real hardcore metal groups out there it hopelessly tries to duplicate with the horrendous, painfully annoying, 'possum stuck in my throat' voice of the lead singer. From the sound of his voice it sounds like his ego is as thick as his talent is thin. The hype behind this group was created back in the eighties by losers my age, mainly hooded ten to thirteen year olds with dreams of being drunks developing a speech impetament. Exactly the way to relate to the lead singer! So, since mainstream America still thinks that Metallica is the greatest metal band ever, it's time someone shed some insight. Metallica is to metal what Christina Aguilera is to metal. They're like the Quiet Riot that didn't know when to quiet. They're like Joe Satriani without all that 'talent' baggage. If you want to know what I mean, listen to 'Skrew' or 'Psychopomps', or even the legendary 'Ministry'. All of which make Metallica look like christian contemporary.<br /><br />On a more personal note some other reviewers had their 5 star reviews posted 4 or 5 times resulting in an innaccurate rating for this item. It's not really fair to the other bands out there that actually ARE listenable. And if you don't like this review, I don't really care because I had fun writing it.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie has made me a better christian than ever. I used to only hear about Jesus suffering for us, but with this movie,I  can visualize only PART of the things that Jesus went through for us. I am sure that he went through 10 times the suffering and doubt than that we see in the movie. It showed me that God really loves us (no matter how awful we are)to be able to do this to his only Son. I had been praying to becoming a better christian, and I believe that this is God's way of answering my prayers.
B00005JMX6|4.0|I can see where the 2004 film entitled \\"The Girl Next Door\\" (they have been making films with this title since 1914) would be squarely in the crosshairs of critics.  In this film, which obviously wants to be \\"Risky Business\\" for this generation the titular character turns out to be a porn star, whose real name is Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, finally getting away from being daddy's little girl on \\"24\\").  Fortunately, Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch; bend your mind around the idea of him as the next Tom Cruise) falls in love with her at first sight and has to be informed of her vocation by his friend Eli (Chris Marquette; who is as far removed from his character on \\"Joan of Arcadia\\" as you can get).<br /><br />Now, on the one hand the idea of a teenage boy getting involved with a teenage porn star is rather offensive.  I mean just think about it in real world terms and unless you are a teenage boy there are some serious problems with this idea.  Add to this the fact that the trailers for this movie made it seem like this was another innocent teenage boy hooks up with slightly older beautiful woman (you know, the entire good boy meets hot girl sub-genre), so when you throw a bunch of \\"adult film\\" actresses into the mix it certainly violates expectations.  No wonder this movie was nominated for a Teen Choice Award as a Choice Movie Your Parents Didn't Want You to See.<br /><br />But what salvages this film is that it really is about the boy next door.  They keep telling us that Danielle is a porn star, and we see some rather tame clips from her films, but despite the encouragement of his friends to the contrary (and the one obligatory misstep) Matthew sees her as Danielle, the girl next door, and not the porn star.  So, since we like the kid, whose dream is to win a scholarship so he can afford to go to Georgetown, we are inclined to see her this way too.  Besides, it is not like she really acts like a porn star (fill in your own idea of what that would be, because whatever it is, she does not do it) and Cuthbert wisely stays away from full nudity, knowing full well it is sexier that way.<br /><br />In the end \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is really just a love story, which will not only surprise but also disappoint those who are looking for a raunchy teenage sex comedy.  Of course there are all sorts of \\"Risky Business\\" like complications involving $25,000 to bring the next Einstein to America from Cambodia and Danielle's producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant, in a scene stealing role) who does not like the idea of some high school boy getting his girl to give up show business.  Kelly is as close as Luke Greenfield's film gets to the sleazy side of the adult entertainment film industry, but his idea of how to mess with the kid is more creative than violent and I really did like his reaction to the twist the film takes at the end.  I was wavering on whether to round up or down from the 3.5 this film was going to get from me, and that was enough to shift the scale towards the high end.<br /><br />In the end your ability to enjoy this film is going to come down to how much you like the two stars, whether you are offended there is not more sex, and how much it bothers you that \\"The Girl Next Door\\" follows the \\"Risky Business\\" playbook from start to finish.  The comedy is better than the sex and I was thinking more about the old Andy Hardy movies where the kids decide to put on a show during the end of this film as anything else.  Maybe it was wrong to laugh at some of the hijinks in this film, but that was what I was doing, although it seems strange to be giving credit to a movie for not going to far given all the opportunities that it has to do so.  But you do get credit for negotiating the curves in this world, which is why \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is probably going to become a late night cable cult classic (albeit in the \\"rated\\" version of the film).tever it is, she does not do it) and Cuthbert wisely stays away from full nudity, knowing full well it is sexier that way. <br /> <br />In the end \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is really just a love story, which will not only surprise but also disappoint those who are looking for a raunchy teenage sex comedy.

B00000IPAX|5.0|<br />Although there are beter \\"artists\\" when it comes to music (pink floyd, Guns n roses) but this cd gets 5 stars because of its ability never to let you get board until the last track stops. You cant really even call it art, its more like immature humor with catchy music. But its really good even for a guy whoes not into the pottymouth stuff. If I was traped on a desert island with my cd player and only one cd... this would be it. Not one bad song. For thoes who are completly unfamiliar of this band, it appeals to mostly the teenager demographic (you should be able to tell by the cover alone) but this might be a cd that tickles your pickle no matter who you are.
B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Service had an unusual start. No, not THAT postal service, but the unique band behind one of the best albums of 2003, the indie-electronic \\"Give Up.\\" Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard and Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello exchanged tapes through the mail, sculpting the sweet, melancholy trip-hop masterpiece \\"Give Up\\".<br /><br />It starts off on strong footing with the melancholy, angelic-voiced \\"District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" with its solemn organ opener. The second song is even stronger -- the sparkling, upbeat \\"Such Great Heights,\\" an adoring love song from a guy to his on-the-road girlfriend. \\"They will see us waving/from such great heights/come down now!/they'll say/but everything looks perfect from far away...\\"<br /><br />With such a great opener, the rest of the album is almost garuanteed to be lackluster. But Gibbard and Tamborello manage to keep the quality up with the delicate \\"Sleeping In,\\" ethereal \\"Nothing Better,\\" and the dreamily majestic \\"Recycled Air\\" with its backdrop of string-like synth. \\"Give Up\\" ends on a slightly darker note with the dark, grittier \\"This Place is a Prison\\" and the fast-paced but strange \\"Brand New Colony,\\" before finishing off with the magnificently cacophonous \\"Natural Anthem.\\"<br /><br />\\"Give Up\\" was originally recorded in a rather weird way, with Gibbard and Tamborello exchanging packages with recorded CDs inside. Not your typical way of making music, and some might have scoffed at this unorthodox method. But it pays off beautifully -- the melodious poppy sound of Postal Service is absolutely intoxicating. It's a perfect mix of beats, clicks, dreamy synth and sweet vocals. Gibbard's clear voice is a little sad, and contemplative, and is backed up in some songs by Jen Wood and Jenny Lewis.<br /><br />The lyrics are beautiful, romantic and heartfelt (\\"I am finally seeing/why I was the one worth leaving...\\"), often evoking a slightly otherworldly feeling, not tied in with the world as we know it. It brings up dark cities, flying couples, gaudy apartments and places where things are sad and a little dreamy. The keyboard arrangements are shimmering, guitar riffs are steady and solid, and a cluster of other instruments (organ and horn) surface and vanish seamlessly.<br /><br />\\"Give Up\\" both satisfies a musical hunger and leaves you wanting more. Proving that innovation is NOT dead in the music biz, the Postal Service is a fantastic breath of fresh air. Dreamy, a little depressed, but uplifting and sweet.cities, flying couples, gaudy apartments and places where things are sad and a little dreamy.

B00028HBKM|4.0|Ok, to start off, I will admit my biases.  I am not a Christian, and I will never be a Christian.  I have been down that road before, and logic and reason have shown me the light.  That having been said, let's start the review... <br /> <br />This movie is very well done.  The makers payed very close attention to detail and did not shy away from things people usually find offensive (violence).  This movie is not afraid to be bloody, cruel, or nasty.  What impressed me the most was the fact that they kept the whole hocus pocus, supernatural part of the story to a minimum.  The fact that none of the lines were in English was also a big plus.  That is a detail that I fully support when it comes to making a film such as this believable. The directing and cinemetogrophy are both top notch, but this was to be expected. <br /> <br />There is an awesome whipping scene that is just fun to watch becuase it is as close to realistic as possible.  I don't understand why people freak out about that scene and go home and have a nice steak dinner.   <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Very well put together movie.  This is apparent whether you are a Christian or not.  This movie will not change your views unless you do not have a solid foundation for them (Euthephro).  We can all agree that a man named Jesus once lived.  Watch this movie while eating lasagna.
0812550706|5.0|I have read this book 3 or 4 times.  It's story remains with me all the time.  If you are not a science fiction fan you probably will still like this book since it isn't that heavy in sci-fi.  The book is more of a character study, getting in the head of the main character Ender.  The story has some great twists and turns and the ending to me was totally unexpected. <br /> <br />There are other books in this series, Ender's Game (the first one) is by far the best book.  I didn't enjoy the others as much other than the most recent one, Ender's Shadow.  Ender's Shadow is the same story as Ender's Game but told from another character's perspective.  If you enjoy Ender's Game I would suggest reading Shadow as well.

B00005JMX6|5.0|This movie did not get the pre-release hype it deserved.  While many reviewers have commented on its similarities to Risky Business, those similarities are only superficial.  Yes, this is a teen romantic comedy.  Yes, it has at its central characters an all American adolescent guy and a hot girl with a sex industry worker past.  And, yes, the opening romantic musical theme sounds a lot like \\"Love on a Real Train - Risky Business\\", probably because the original music was done by Paul Haslinger, who was a member of Tangerine Dream for most of their memorable music soundtracks (but not a member of the band when they did the soundtrack for Risky Business).  That is where the similarities end, however. <br /> <br />Where Risky Business was about getting out of trouble caused by being smitten with a prostitute, The Girl Next Door was about voluntarily getting into trouble because of genuine love for a girl that just happened to be an ex Porn star.  As far as movies about being young, in love, and under pressure go, they don't get much better than this.  I really liked this movie, however I can't imagine why the DVD is rated UR as opposed to R.  My guess is that with any imaginative editing, at all, it could have easily been rated PG-13.  It certianly doesn't push the boundaries in the other direction (toward NC17).  If you were ever young you probably will really like this movie.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|While this film does not offer anything really new to those who are fans of Science Fiction and Fantasy, it does present a  plausible, though dark and depressing, contemporary setting for use of the film's vehicle - time travel / alternate realities.  The moral issues are key here. If you were presented with a means to go back and change events in your past that led to the mental and physical pain and suffering of those you care about, would you, or should you go back and change something that would affect the outcome of that event?  What if you go back and change terrible acts and find that other unexpected bad things occured as a result of your intervention?  Should you continue to try to affect changes?  What if your motives are selfish? Does that affect the outcome?  Besides the moral choices and issues, the movie provokes one to assess the consistancy of the logic in aspects of the film - its timelines and premises. These are the things that make this movie thought provoking, especially since the film was well thought out in advance by its authors / directors.  Please don't get hung up on the inevitable logic flaws that one finds in this type of movie; learn to see past them, for they are minor. This movie is definitely worth seeing, but be prepared both to put your brain in gear, and to face the darker aspects of growing up in today's world - this is not a casual movie.
B000001ELP|5.0|Many KISS fans did not know what to make of The Elder when it was released in 1981.  Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons set out to make an album along the lines of Destroyer.  They enlisted the help of producer Bob Ezrin, who suggested an adventurous concept album.  The Elder (the first KISS album featuring the late drummer Eric Carr) was a musical fable about a council of fathers (\\"when the earth was young, they were already old\\") who watched over the world \\"and all its creatures.\\"  When a force of darkness is unleashed upon the earth, they look for a young warrior (\\"just a boy\\") to conquer the  evil designs of the enemy.  It was supposed to be a motion picture (hence the title \\"Music from the...\\").  Paul and Gene were excited about taking KISS in a new, ambitious direction, right down to the new short hair and Medieval costumes.  Ace Frehley hated the idea and only appears on \\"Dark Light.\\"  History shows that Ace was correct as far as the financial success and fan base of the band.  The album did not sell well and, except for a few television appearances promoting the album, KISS did not embark on a tour and any movie plans (however far along they were) were abandoned.    My personal opinion is that this album is brilliant.  Despite its poor reviews and negative feedback, I am glad the band recorded it as I find it to be one of the most interesting and innovative hard rock albums I have ever heard.  \\"Just a Boy\\" is beautiful.  Paul definitely shows off his vocal range on this one.  \\"Only You\\" and \\"Under the Rose\\" are amazing and, \\"A World Without Heroes\\" is a work of art both musically and lyrically.  \\"I\\" (which KISS played a lot during their television specials) is also a catchy rocker although the lyrics may be a little sappy (\\"I believe in me\\").  Ace provides vocals on \\"Dark Light\\" which most KISS fans deem as their favorite (maybe because it's Ace's song and most fans were on his side at the time).  The album begins and ends with a Medieval-sounding tune and conversation among the Elder at their table.  The last words are that they regard the young warrior they selected as a \\"true champion,\\" indicating that the album isn't about the fight against evil but the struggle within the chosen one whether he has it in him to fight the forces of evil.  It is a look within one's self.  Most will disagree, but I find The Elder as solid and engaging as anything KISS has put out.  If you have shied away from The Elder, I suggest listening to the music clips provided by Amazon and, if you are intrigued, give The Elder a chance.  I think it is unjustly criticized and dreadfully underrated.  Now that we know where KISS went musically almost 25 years later, fans can listen to The Elder and appreciate it for what it is:  a brief period of innovation and a true masterpiece.
B0002IU988|5.0|I am floored by this album. This is the best music I've heard in my life. I was a huge Creed fan, but I disliked Scott Stapp. Mark Tremonti and Scott Phillips reunite with Brian Marshall and enlist Myles Kennedy from The Mayfield Four to perform the next big rock group. Mark Tremonti brings some of the best guitar work out there, and Myles Kennedy has the best rock voice in the world. Check this album out...
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is not Joy Division.  Let's get off that worn path.  The lyrical phrasing is reminiscent of Ian Curtis -- and it ends there.  Nothing else about Interpol should remind anyone of Joy Division. <br /> <br />To start, this is pounding rock and roll.  If you don't believe me, check out the last couple minutes of track four, \\"PDA.\\"  If you can manage to listen to that without cranking the volume and without the temptation to pound some air drums or air bass -- well, you must be rhythmically challenged.  \\"PDA\\" is one of the few songs I've heard that inspires me to test the absolute limits of my sound system.  If I were to see these guys live, I would hope they would extend that section to 10 minutes or more, whipping the whole crowd into a frenzy.    <br /> <br />Interpol is dominated by a driving rhythm section.  The drummer and bassist seem to enjoy a sort of Vulcan mind meld that only comes from hundreds of hours of isolated collaboration.  It pumps.  Would anyone say that about Joy Division? <br /> <br />It doesn't end with rhythm.  The guitars are atmospheric and droning.  A faux-strings keyboard sneaks in and out seamlessly.  In fact, the harmonies are mostly delicious, with rare exception.  A perfect example can be found in the final transition of \\"NYC\\" (New York Cares).  Droning guitars give way to keyboards, which then bow out to fast-strumming guitar octaves.  Where with Radiohead the furious guitar octaves are agitating -- as in either in \\"Airbag\\" from OK Computer or in \\"Creep\\" from Pablo Honey -- with Interpol they are subtle and hum along with the prevailing overcast moodiness.    <br /> <br />Together, the effect is seamless.  In fact, the quality of Interpol which has driven the comparison with Joy Division, the feel of the vocals (certainly not the content) -- well, that quality might be the least substantial part of the band.   <br /> <br />This is a unique band with many strengths.  At least, Interpol separates from its influences by the driving power of its rhythms, and the seamless integration of all the harmonic parts.   <br /> <br />It might be moody, but it is never harsh like its supposed influences.  (Except for \\"Obstacle 1\\", which is hailed as the best track by the pundits but which gives me a headache every time).  At a minimum, it is more dense and nuanced.   <br /> <br />This is an exceptionally strong album.
0790729628|2.0|put the original version on dvd with harrison fords commentary. it's part of the movie. it's great. all you hear is dead silence on the directors cut. i guess we have no choice.
B00005A46T|1.0|Think about it,if they had a ounce of talent,would they hide beneath those idiotic get-ups?
B000059GEH|3.0|This is a fun movie, but if you have a regular size tv, I don't recommend buying the dvd.  I normally like letter box viewing, but this was the second Cinemascope movie made, and the director shot almost 80% of it (or more?) in medium long shot.  So every shot shows the actors from the top of their heads down to mid-calf, usually clumped in the middle two-thirds of the shot, with lots of extra space on the far sides of the screen, filled with such interesting things as furniture and curtains.  Close ups are rare, as are mid shots.  It's like the director, faced with the new screen shape, shot it like a play viewed from the 22nd row.  If you have a regular size tv, it means you can barely see the talented actress's faces.  This is one of the times it's too bad that the dvd wasn't released (as some used to be) with BOTH widescreen and the \\"pan and scan\\", formatted-for-tv versions.  Normally I way prefer the letter box -- but this movie is pretty hard to watch that way.  So that's my warning.  The movie itself is commercial fluff, but Lauren Bacall is a lot of fun in her smart, edgy mode; and this was Marilyn Monroe's break-through year, with this charming, funny performance, and also \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\" (which is not in Cinemascope and looks just great on dvd).<br /><br />P.S. Well a year or so later, I relented and bought the movie anyway, because Monroe and Bacall are so likable in it.  And what I say is still true that its use of the camera is very monotonous, not enough close ups or mid shots.  But once you accept that, it's still a fun, commercial movie.

B00005B4GU|4.0|By no means lefovers from 'Kid A', the band's second outing of 2000 holds its own ground, and then some. Putting it bluntly, Radiohead once again delivers and puts the competition to shame. Not much stood up to this at the time, which of course is expected from Radiohead. Despite crap overflowing the airwaves, Amnesiac could care less about what's going on in modern music. It just pushes the boundries of music forward. The only other albums I even bought from 2000 were 'Kid A', 'White Pony' by Deftones, and 'Mer De Noms' by A Perfect Circle. Kid A is still my personal favourite from Radiohead, but Amnesiac is a very satisfying listen, and I highly recommend it to any true fans. A near 5-star-performance setback only by a few forgettable moments, and \\"Hunting Bears\\", the song that could have been... But that is of course just my opinion. You'll love it.<br /><br />Standouts: Like Spinning Plates; Life In a Glass House; You and Whose Army?; Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors
0790731940|4.0|A great movie!  What an all star cast!  This movie is worth watching over and over again.
B00005JMJG|5.0|If your a technical person, you'll adore the effects and camerawork in this movie.  If you love stories, you'll adore this movie as well. it's absolutely perfect, I couldn't imagine a better movie as a whole. magnificent!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I love this show. It is so funny and witty. The dialogue is excellent and the acting is so good. I love this show and can't wait to get this for christmas. Me and my sister got the 1st season and watched it all the way through! Great show that holds a special place in my life. Quite the show.  <br /> <br />Also watch: <br />\\"C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation\\" <br />\\"The O.C.\\" <br />\\"The Nanny\\" I wish this came out on DVD <br />\\"Seinfeld\\"
B000000SDB|3.0|Il suono  stupendo certo, e la direzione sicura. Ma a volte, specie nelle prime sinfonie, sembra come di sentire una eco di...Bach. La nona sinfonia poi ha dei tempi troppo lenti e sincopati. Provate a connfrontarla con una delle stupende interpretazioni di Karajan, e capirete la differenza.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Why not review these DVDs without seeing them? Everyone else is doing it. <br /> <br />I support Star Wars, George Lucas and the updating of these films to make them even better than before. <br /> <br />But most of all, I support eight billion reviews being posted of DVDs that no one has seen yet.
B000002NBY|5.0|I am normally a bit wary of mainstream recognition, but if there were an album that truly deserved all the accolades given, this is it.  Graceland was the first album I owned and the first album that I remember hearing in its wonderful entirety (I was only 5 when it was released).  It's one of those must-own albums that any respectable music collection should contain, regardless of the type of music one normally listens to.  I currently own it on CD, cassette, and vinyl - incidentally, if you haven't heard it on vinyl before I highly suggest it; 18 years later I'm still hearing nuances of the music I hadn't noticed before.  Basically, I agree with the commentor who said this would be their desert-island album.
B000002HK4|3.0|For the 23 minute title track alone, this album is worth your money.  That is one of my favorite Dream Theater songs ever, but I have never been able to really get into the rest of the album.  Don't get me wrong, Dream Theater does a great job on the cover songs, and it's really great to listen and see how these musical geniuses intertwine so many songs into one long one.  Suprisingly though, I very rarely listen to this album all the way through.  I usually find myself taking it out of my CD player after the first track.  I think most of my lack of interest comes from not really ever being into the bands they covered.  My overall opinion is that anyone into Prog should buy this album for the first track alone, but just don't expect typical Dream Theater throughout the rest of the album.  If you want a true Dream Theater masterpiece I would buy 'Images & Words' or 'Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory'.
0743454529|3.0|I loved Perfect Match and Second Glance, so I was really looking forward to this book.  Good things about this book: it is obviously well-researched, it's moving, and the characters of Campbell, Judge and Julia are interesting.  However, something is not right with this book.  It tries too hard to be profound.  The poems dealing with fire that preceed every chapter add nothing.  The metaphors of the firefighting husband, the arsonist son, the astronomy stuff fall flat.  The surprise ending is horrific and shocking.  It felt like the book veered into the horror realm.  And the fallout from all of it is not discussed: what about the drug addict son, what about the father's depression and \\"bout\\" with alcoholism, what do the mother and daughter feel after everything that transpires?   Well, this has happened a lot lately.  Really good authors are putting out some duds: see Patricia Cornwell's Blow Fly, the latest Julie Smith, the latest Marian Keys.  I think these authors are being pushed too hard by their publishers, and need to slow down a bit.
B00028HBL6|5.0|This movie is recommended for all with the exception of small children.  The movie is not only beautifully executed, but holds a truth that all need to know.  This film is perfect for those looking for a deeper understanding and for those looking for quality entertainment (though you will get more than entertainment).
B000000OUE|5.0|I know some would say that's contradictory, and I admit five stars is a bit high for this album. It's not a timeless work of art.  I just bought the complete Brandenburg Concertos off of Amazon and that might be a timeless work of art.  Those tunes have been around for a what, a couple hundred years?  Astrocreep has been out nine years now. I really liked it when it came out. At the time it was a different blend of metal, with some industrial, techno, and sound clips thrown in.  A week ago I popped it back into the cd player for the first time in maybe three years and I have to say I still really like it. Unlike a lot of other albums from the mid nineties, this one still sounds relevant. You may have to skip a weak track or two (I usually do), and you have to be in the mood for some pretty dark and heavy stuff (this isn't a Corrs album), but clearly Rob Zombie and friends put in some real effort here. So if you're looking for something heavy, but not the typical pure, repetitive thrashing and screaming on most metal albums, this one might be for you.
B000002GGU|5.0|This album is really the best Bryan Adams album! Loads of rockers left and right!  And he did the power ballads right here, not the post-'91 sappy stuff that he had to follow up after that massive movie song hit.  Summer of '69, One Night Love Affair, the fist-pumping Somebody and its low-end bass guitar, the daring Run To You, the dramatic Heaven and the no-nonsense Kids Wanna Rock justify Bryan's rebellious, hot like fire attitude! A big full live sound dominates this album! Bob Clearmountain's production is just phenomenal here! I don't think that anything he's done afterwards tops this album.  A musical tour de force that Bryan should be proud of to this day!
0156027321|5.0|You have to admire an author who can successfully contain the action in a novel to a lifeboat.  I found myself facinated as Pi struggles to both exist and find meaning in his unusual circumstances.  The author does a fine job making his point on existential issues and religion without sermonizing or forcing the story. <br /> <br />I did not understand the island.  I would be interested in what others saw as significant there.  As an editor I would have questioned its inclusion in the story.  It seemed to belong to  another story.  This sequence isn't as tourtuous or distracting as Melville's small boat rowing through a pod of whales for forty or more pages in Moby Dick.  I was distracted by these two small boat metaphors where nature is beautiful and deadly.   <br /> <br />This book is one of my favorites over the last two or three years.
B001AQO41E|4.0|This is one of the greatest horror films in the history of cinema. While not the scariest film of all time, it has a great story and special effects that still holds up today for the most part, and it's just downright creepy.<br /><br />This blu-ray book edition is pretty good, in that the book that comes attached to the case is a great little read for behind-the-scenes info on the film. The film itself is definitely a great print of the film. It looks and sounds better than ever. However, the bonus features are severely lacking on this release. All we get are a couple of features dealing with \\"real-life\\" poltergeist phenomenon, and absolutely nothing that goes behind-the-scenes on the making of the film itself. Not even a single commentary. Very disappointing there.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I will stress once again that this is absolutely the best edition available for the film, so if you love the movie, it is still worth the purchase.
B00009V7T2|5.0|What can I say? This is the best album I've heard in years. But you have to give it a chance. You may not get into it immediately, but when you do, you thank yourself for doing so. GOD I LOVE THIS ALBUM!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I argue this is possibly the best American musical ever made.  And refute anyone who doesn't believe this is Bernstein's most fabulous score, with a huge nod to Sondheim (lyrics) and Robbins (choreography) in order.  It's steeped in the style and idiom of the day, there's a nostalgia infused throughout, yet it remains fresh and timeless and consistantly affecting.  The music and choreography is splendid ~ the duet 'Somewhere' between Tony and Maria is one of the most eloquent love song ever penned.  The story involving rival gangs and juvenile delinquents was controversial and cutting-edge for the time and will never go out of style.  Neither will ill-fated love and misunderstood teenaged angst and prejudice and blind ignorance.  WEST SIDE STORY is, as most are aware, a reworking of Shakespeare's immortal tale ROMEO AND JULIET, and a worthy one at that.  My fourteen-year-old daughter was spellbound throughout and literally fell apart during the ending.  (I admit to a few tears of my own).  A classic.
B000002KMY|5.0|This release was the follow-up to the excellent Heaven and Hell.  Even though it was released more than twenty years ago, it still sounds better than most of the music that's being released.  The band lineup on this one was Ronnie James Dio on vocals, Tony Iommi on guitar, Geezer Butler on bass, and Vinny Appice on drums, with keyboards by Geoff Nicholls.  A very tight lineup that also went on record and release Live Evil and Dehumanizer.  Standout tracks are \\"Voodoo\\" and \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\", along with the title track.  Very recommended for fans of classic metal.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Best description of my reaction, WOW! After the departure of Eric Woolfson from The Project, and the long wait for a new release, and word that Alan was going in a new direction with his new release, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Well, Alan never disappoints! While his new CD is nothing like the Project albums I've loved in the past, it still has the Parsons signature on it, and is very addictive. I've not been able to take it out of my CD player since the first playing, and have listened to it perhaps 20 times since. Every listening is just as enjoyable as the first. Fans will rank this as one of his best.<br />UPDATE:  THREE MONTHS after purchasing this CD, I STILL listen to it. I've ripped it to my PC hard drive so I can easily listen while I'm working at home, it's on my zip drive so I can take it to work, it's on my iPod so I can listen to it while I workout at the gym, and I made an extra copy for the car... Obssessed?  Yeah, maybe...  But I can't get it out of my head!
B00005ASHM|4.0|I have just listened to Pet Sounds for the first time. Having only heard their hedonistic surfs up nonsense before i must say it was far, far better than i expected. There are some great songs on it and the production is amazing. I would thouroughly recommend it to anyone who has an inerest in listening to the Beach Boys or just wants to hear a brilliantly put together piece of pop. But the best album of all time, please!! Its great,but it aint that great.

6305907145|1.0|I saw this movie at home last night and I was appalled.  They took Jane Austen's simple, exciting plot, marvellous characters of the kind only Jane Austen can create, and ruined it completely.  Where was Aunt Norris' gnawing nastiness?  Sir Thomas' dignity (the movie makers made him into some kind of lecher who abused slaves in the worst way in Antigua!)?  Lady Bertram's humorous lassitude?  Fanny Price's father's embarrassing (but to us highly amusing) vulgarity?  And am I the only one who noticed the slightly lesbian tones in Mary Crawford's attentions to Fanny, especially when Fanny has to take off her wet clothes?  Good grief! <br />Jane Austen must be turning in her grave. <br />The only reason I am giving this movie one star is because of the costumes.  They are beautiful.  Everything else about the movie is appalling. <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|Five years ago, I began collecting the 2-episode Star Trek discs.  The video and audio were superb and Star Trek has never looked or sounded better.  I eagerly awaited each new release, and it seemed to take forever for Paramount to issue the entire series.  But at last, after three years, I had all 40 discs.<br /><br />By then, this method of releasing TV episodes seemed like, well, \\"stone knives and bear skins.\\"  Everybody else was doing season boxes and this had become the norm.  (A notorious exception is the original Twilight Zone, which ran to 43 discs, later collected into five box sets, but in random order, seasons mixed together, etc.)  Wouldn't it have been nice if I could have saved all that money and shelf space?  Oh, well...<br /><br />NOW they put out season boxes.  Gee, thanks guys.  Too bad I can't get a trade-in on the old ones.  But, let's look at the bright side.  I loved watching these episodes again, in vivid color and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, and I enjoyed the anticipation of waiting for the next pair of discs to come out.<br /><br />For those of you who didn't buy the old discs, you're in luck.  This new set is the same transfer, but I don't think it could get any better.  You do get a few extra features that didn't appear on the old discs (which included only the old trailers), but let's face it --- there are only about 10,000 books on Star Trek if you want background material.  It would have been nice if they'd included the blooper reel.<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is that the boxes will show the episodes in broadcast order, as opposed to production order, as in the old 2-episode discs.  Having watched all of these shows dozens of times over the years, I can assure you that it makes a big difference watching them in the order they were made.  The character development is much smoother and makes more sense.  You also don't have such inconsistencies as Dr. McCoy suddenly disappearing in mid-season for the pilot \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" --- to say nothing of the uniform differences.<br /><br />But, hey, it's not a perfect world.an Has Gone Before\\" --- to say nothing of the uniform differences.   <br /> <br />But, hey, it's not a perfect world. <br />

0380977788|4.0|Let me tell you a little story.  almost a year ago, I was on a movie web site, looking at a page of Henry Selick, director of stop-motion films. There was a list of his works:The Nightmare Before Chistmas,(AWESOME MOVIE!! :-D )James and the Giant Peach,(cute film!) and Monkybone(Sick,sick,film).  Then I noticed another title on top of the list. It was called Coraline. When I clicked on this link, the page said this film was under production. The only summary I got was that a little british girl grows bored of her dull life and finds a doorway leading into a other world with other parents.  I found another link and it said that this was based on the book by Neil Gaiman and it was really creapy,saying that the parents literaly had big black buttons for eyes.  And I,being the big babby that I offten am, shut the site down and never tryed looking at it again for a while.  Several months later, I saw it in a book store and took a peek at it. I read a little text, saw a few illistrations, And felt I would die of fright(sort of)if I kept looking at it anymore. Many months pasted and It was still on my mind. So eventually, I bought the book, I read it two minites later and I wouldn't stop. Later that day My folks and I went to see the film,Hellboy(pretty cool!) and as soon as I came home, I pick up the darn creepy thing and read on till I finished it. And I liked it.  <br /> <br />It told the story of Coraline, a girl in a apartment with seemingly neglectful parents, and odd neihboors. She eventualy finds a strange key that unloocks a old door into a Totally different appartment with other parents and other neighboors. She also enconters creepy rats,chocolate eating dogs and a smart mouth, cheshere cat-like black cat.Coraline's other parents \\"love\\" her very much and don't want to let her go. But by the time she comes back, she finds that her real parents have compleatly disapered. Now with the aid of the black cat, and a strange stone, Coraline must use her wits to battle evil mice,clay-people-like freaks,her other mother,the \\"beldam\\" to save her parents and three young ghostly victims of the other mother's curse.  <br /> <br /> Yep, It's undeiniably one of the creepiest, weirdist, and yet, delightful masterpeices in literiture and entertainment.  And speaking of entertainment, Henry Selick just happens to be making a movie out of this strange, fun, and unusual book.  And I already know that such films like Snow White and the seven dwarfs and The Nightmare Before Christmas will look like innocent kiddie films compared to That!  So heres some advice; parents, If you want your kids to grow up mentaly healthy and normal, keep them away from this book! Far,FAR AWAY!(unless the're used to scary stuff or the're at least 13 years old) Nevertheless, this is a very cool book with a very nice moral. I'd rate it 5 stars but the horror theme is the only little drawback.
B00005JMH2|3.0|The only reason I went to see \\"Shall We Dance\\" is because it was free.  <br /> <br />Really. <br /> <br />That was it. <br /> <br />I had heard of the original Japanese version of the movie but had not seen it. <br /> <br />My expectations for this movie were low, bottom of the barrel.  <br /> <br />I hate Jennifer Lopez with a vengeance and I thought I would just get a laugh at how horrendous this movie would be.  <br /> <br />I also knew that because it was a free movie pass, chances were I would have to critique it at the end by filling out the usual questionnaire.  <br /> <br />This was going to be the best part of the entire experience.  <br /> <br />I would have the opportunity to slam J.Lo! <br /> <br />I guess it's always good when expectations are set low, because once in a while a movie will surprise you.  <br /> <br />I love Richard Gere.  <br /> <br />I love Susan Sarandon.  <br /> <br />I love Stanley Tucci.  <br /> <br />All three were very good in this movie. Tucci and Sarandon shone the brightest by far. <br /> <br />Any scene with Tucci in it would have laughing out loud. He literally stole the show.  <br /> <br />Sarandon was a little underused but that's understandable.  <br /> <br />It is clearly Gere's movie. No one else's. Not even J.Lo's who can't emote for the life of her. <br /> <br />She's supposed to be all heartbroken and sad and melacholic and yet she's just lifeless and wooden and dry.  <br /> <br />You would think that after having her heart broken by Affleck, she could reflect on her own life and bring some of that heartbreak to the screen. <br /> <br />Not so.  <br /> <br />She has no chemistry with Gere whatsoever. <br /> <br />She spends 99% of her scenes crying or standing by the window (which I guess must be her way of showing longing) or crying WHILE standing by the window. <br /> <br />I am happy to say that Gere and Sarandon had way more chemistry than he did with J.Lo. Which is good. Since they play husband and wife. <br /> <br />It is unfortunate that J.Lo was cast in this role. She was cleary the wrong actress. They didn't really need such a big name star for that role. They had plenty with Gere, Tucci and Sarandon. <br /> <br />Thankfully it's a small part but it's very present in the movie which annoyed not only me but many of the moviegoers at the theater. An unknown actress would have been much better.  <br /> <br />Less obstrusive. More poignant.  <br /> <br />But J.Lo messed it up. <br /> <br />I am sure she got the part because of her dancing skills which were better served in \\"The Wedding Planner\\" than here. <br /> <br />The director made several attempts at luring the audience into falling in love with J.Lo by showing her dancing in front of the mirror as if that would make us all ga-ga over her.  <br /> <br />Must have been the same approach the director had in \\"Gigli\\" with the yoga scene which was (from what I hear since I haven't seen it) the best part in that horrendous movie. <br /> <br />Overall it was an enjoyable movie if you are able to ignore J.Lo and pretend she ever existed.  <br /> <br />If they cut out her parts, the movie would be much better.  <br /> <br />Of course, I didn't see the final version of the movie. They may make changes to it after the results of the screen test come in. <br /> <br />But if you do decide to watch it, pay close attention to the scene with Sarandon and the detective in the bar.  <br /> <br />It is by far one of the best scenes in the movie and Sarandon nails it with the grace and style she's known for. <br />
B000148KK2|5.0|I was amazed at how many Diana Krall fans on this site didn't respond to this incredible record. I encourage all of you one two and three star folks to re-look at this amazing piece of work. Take a long drive at night and put this cd into your car stereo...Songs like \\"Departure Bay\\" and my favortie \\"I'm Coming Through\\" were so clearly written from her heart at a moment of great joy and pain. - These songs are lush and lonely and really breathtaking. A great piece of art here and the best kind- from the artists own personal journey.
B000002UA5|4.0|A lot of reviews, are so taken back by the studio album, that they don't give the Live Album a chance. So here is my song for song review of Pink Floyd's 1970 double album Ummugumma:    STUDIO ALBUM:    Not all of this is trash. It was probably more liked when it first was realesed and the hippie feel of the music seems somewhat dated by today's standards.    1. Sysyphus: A solo Rick Wright effort. It starts out well, until at the end of part two, it soundes as if he's trying to smash the piano. Part 3 stinks. Four is okay... and yes I did nearlly have a heart attack when the music suddenly comes back, in the middle of part 4.   Overall:B-    2.Grandchester Meadows/Several Species of Small Furry Animals Have....blah,blah sod it!  Two Roger Waters songs. The first one is a quite good, and ends strangely. The second one will make you say WTF? After a few listens, you might laugh at it.  Overall:A-    3.The Narrow Way: A David Gilmour effort. Truely this is the highlight of this CD. Unfortanatley the booklet doesn't provide lyrics for this. Unfortanatley, parts of this song go all over the place, making me lower the grade.  Overall:A    4.The Grand Vizer's Garden Party: As good as a drummer Nick Mason was or is, his ten minute song, is hard to keep up much intrest, making nearly every second unlistenable. It only really gets going at the very end. Oh well.  Overall:D-    HALFWAY BREAK: I first heard of this, when my Uncle showed me the original Double Album. The cover for the studio Album was back to back with the Live cover. On the studo cover, it says something to the effect of \\"A Two-LP set, for the price of one\\". The original album had different pictures then these. There is one of Waters and(Jude)whom I've never heard of, and several pictures of Nick Mason looking up and down.I remmember him telling me that there's a scream in this song called Careful with that Axe Eugene, and I thought that was dumb at the time...    Live Album:  1. A great ten-minute opener, better than the original (slightly).  Overall:A    2.Careful with that Axe Eugene: The best song of the album, no question about it. It still sounds new, every time I hear it.  Overall:A+    3.Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun: Pretty boring. There's a better version in live at Pompeii, which on it's own was a bit of a disapointment.  Overall:C    4.A Saucerful of Secrets: A lot of banging and noise, that for some reason should be in there. The whole band, really comes together here. Great closer.  Overall:A    Some bottom Line. Only buy this, if your a serious Pink Floyd fan, and not new to their music.

B00005JMXX|4.0|Ok, so this is a fun, good movie to see and even to own,  with great special effects, and good acting, but i mean oh my goodness, thier are some very, funny things here. (I mean they aren't meant to be funny!) But it's  very enjoyable! See it, Rent it, just maybey don't buy it.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin gets a reputation for being a theif of American blues. While they may have done so, nothing can detract from the quality of their second album. It is consistent and full of great tunes. You may find yourself listening to this cd over and over again. Believe me, don't get no compilations of Led Zeppelin's work. The only way to fully appreciate them is through their full albums. Led Zeppelin have carved their reputation as one of the best rock bands ever. Of course, I might be wrong. Listen for yourself. You may enjoy it!
B0000029DD|5.0|how good is an album without faults? about as good as grace...
B00006F83Y|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age is not meant to be Kyuss two. Josh Homme wants people to know his work with Kyuss will always be amazing, but he is now in an new band. That being said, Songs for the Deaf sounds like a Mix between Kyuss, Black Sabbath and the Foo Fighters. Not that this isn't an original piece of music, its just that this record sounds like those three bands. It is definitely an amazing record, particularly when you stack it up with other popular music.    The concept behind this record is the to have an album that one can listen to on travels between Palm Desert and Los Angeles. This is pretty interesting considering that cities mentioned the radio samplings are actually between these two cities. When it boils down to it though, Songs for the Deaf is a great record. The singles are good, but the album tracks are what make this record great. It is really hard to skip any track on this one, since they are all amazing. Favorites for me include the opener, the title track and Another Love Song. Stoner rock influences are heard throughout.  Is this record worth getting? I would say so. Interestingly, due to this album's intensity, I don't think anyone should start off with it since it is pretty heavy. However, once one settles into Queen's material, one can find there is much to like about this album.
B000007ODY|5.0|Wonderful performances from the finest of the Brahms conductors...Herbie Karajan.  Wonderfully straightfoward performances without the wayward stylings of the 63 set.... <br /> <br />That being said the Fourth and First of the 63 set are incredible and deserve to be in any serious Brahms collection ... <br /> <br />sonincally these are very fine readings!!!
B00006GFAB|3.0|The first 15 tracks are \\"klassik KISS\\". One is Ace's solo hit \\"NY Groove\\". One is the misguided yet still a hit \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\", the last 4 were the 80s/90s era stuff. Even though they've done well with the makeup on, they had a great run in the 80s and were played a lot on MTV. Just that era alone (1982-1992) could be a hits package on its own.  <br /> <br />As an intro to KISS, it's okay, but far from a decent overview. I think that it's been long overdue for them to do a 2 CD career retrospective that gives you 2 1/2 hours of everything old and new fans know and love, spanning the range of \\"Strutter\\" to \\"Psycho Circus\\" and everything in between, this way all bases are covered and little is lost in the process. Some of the (79-82) stuff was rediscovered thanks to \\"Unplugged\\" (which is the one you should have out of if you like KISS) and can make it on here as well.  <br /> <br />Van Halen put 36 songs on their recently released \\"Best of Both Worlds\\", Aerosmith put 30 on \\"O Yeah\\" (both I'm sure could have gone for more if they wanted to).  <br /> <br />I'm pretty sure that KISS can put 39-40 of their songs on there, as well as a DVD of all their videos (which amount to almost 40 themselves and have been bootlegged countless times) going back to 1975 up to 1998. Now that would truly be \\"the very best of KISS\\".  <br /> <br />
B0000042H4|5.0|After listening to the dull and heavy performance of Karajan..... here we have  Solti!!! and he really  brings  epic  life affirming fullness to the Wangerian ethos.<br /><br />The wonderful work of the Vienna Philharmonic is always a pleasure and with such a super cast which is having a \\"good day\\" so to speak we are given Wagner with no holds barred.<br /><br />I am always impressed with the Hans Hotter Wotan...there is simply no better on any disc of this...<br /><br />Karl Bohm's Theo Adam always dissapointed me and Bohm's ;use of Gwyneth Jones always confounded my sensibitities...maybe she way a fine actress but she stunk out loud.<br /><br />As to other great aspects of this Ring is a wonderful round Decca recording with super dynamics and excellent perspective.  Added to this the wondeful Principal winds of the Vienna phil and you are on your way...<br /><br />I also love the way Solti paces this work..heeding the natural flow rather than forcing us to slow dull tempos like Szell(Met from the 40s...and Karajan in Berlin from the 70s...)<br /><br />This is the REAL Ring!!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I've heard mixed reviews-some people were saying that it was boring and too long, and some thought it was great. I wasn't expecting much and, boy, was I pleasantly surprised.It was a long movie but it was certainly entertaining enough. Russell Crowe was excellent as a captain of a british ship and the battle scenes were very impressive. I think you have to like the movies about the sea in order to enjoy it. I do and I spent pleasant couple of hours watching this.
B00004SA86|5.0|There is a sublime quality to these readings...the BRSO is not Berlin or NY but they seem to strive for goals and ideals far beyond the reaches of these groups.  There is a sense of the mountains  in this music...inspired majesty and an almost unbelievable passion to all of these readings!! <br /> <br />Sadly, few people ever get the chance to listen to Kubelik in this repetoire and time has been unkind to his memory.  On an occassion I had the chance of working with Maestro Kubelik and can say he brought passion to every bar and phrase he ever conducted!!! <br /> <br />For me this is Mahler etched in stone...very well played and with alot of edge...not for those who expect refinement and cloying beauty...but instead pure water which flows to the ocean.....the Second is very well done with excellent brass and singing throughout... <br /> <br />The 5th is very cleanly played and without vulgarity...the 9th has a very slavic sound to the winds which I find very appealing.   <br /> <br />The 1st and 4th are among the very finest versions ever done with some wonderful singing...the Finale of #4 is incredibly played with excellent lower brass and winds.  <br /> <br />The 8th has some wonderful sonorities with excellent singing from Fischer-Dieskau....this is a very volatile performance and bear repeated listening... <br /> <br />The 3rd here is truly epic and the 1st movement is among the finest played ever.  <br /> <br />Go for IT YOU Mahlerians!!!!!
B00003CXXM|3.0|I didn't care for it at all. For an action movie this wasn't very entertaining. I read the book sometime ago and enjoyed it but the movie doesn't even come close. Matt Damon is a very poor choice for this role with this boy next door looks and bland personality. I also don't know what's with the ridiculous role that Julia Stiles was playing, it was very annoying. Don't bother.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|How can you sum up the pixies in this little space they offer you? The first time I heard them I didn't know what to think of them. Weird and totally original, they rocketed to the top of my CD collection. The lead singer Frank Black's voice is haunting and mesmerizing it just pulled me in. The music itself is just rock and roll in its purest most raw form. You can just listen and tell it isn't over produced. If you like Nirvana or Radiohead then you should definitely check this out. This collection is pretty insane because it has all the songs you need to listen to really appreciate the Pixies. If you like it you should buy the DVD too, it has a great live concert on it and their insane videos. Most people would know at least one of their songs \\"where is my mind\\" from the ending credits of Fight Club, also one of their best songs. The good thing now is after years of being broken up they are back together and touring, so you can actually see them live now. So buy the record and if you like it buy their other CD's. If you are a true rock fan then you won't be disappointed!
B0000062GK|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says-when it comes to playing a guitar Joe Satriani is God. I don't think I've ever been dissapointed in any of his cds. If you are a fan, don't miss this one.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you like Jane Austen, and especially if you like BBC recreations of classic British Literature, you will love this program.  The leads are perfectly cast, even Colin Firth, who seems to \\"warm\\" to the role as the series progresses.  Much of the dialogue is straight out of the novel, and most major plot elements are incorporated to some extent, so this miniseries is much \\"closer\\" to the book than any one-sitting movie could possibly accomplish.  The well-chosen sets, as well as the direction, costuming, and artful cinematography bring the period to life as few other movies have accomplished.  To people who are used to every story arc wrapping up within ninety minutes or all characters wearing their hearts on their sleeves, this program may seem plodding and overly reserved.  To fans of British literature and of Austen in particular, the miniseries format gives us precious extra time with many old and new friends.<br /><br />P.S. The 2005 theatrical release with Keira Knightly is also very good and very well cast. My only concern is that the first hour is so rushed to try to get the story elements in.  This version gives you time to really get to know the characters and removes the sense that everything in Jane Austen occurs at a dead run (which it certainly does not).
B000002JR8|5.0|This was my introduction to Pantera.  I have difficulty describing their sound, but it has elements of speed-metal/death metal, and is even punk at times.  Whatever you want to call it, one thing is for sure:  this album is very hardcore.   <br /> <br />The vocals tend toward throaty, husky screams, but the singer demonstrates great versatility...  just give \\"Planet Caravan\\" a listen after hearing all the songs that precede it on the CD!   <br /> <br />The extremely distorted guitar riffs are complex, and they are creatively done.  The drumming is powerful and intricate, and the guitar solos are amazing pieces of sonic art.  These guys play guitar the way I would like to be able to play... they are powerful, and very primal in their approach.   <br /> <br />This band wears its anger on its collective sleeve.  They hide nothing, and there is no pretense.  If you like genuine emotional release in savage, powerful music, then DON'T pass this up! <br />
B00005OWIU|5.0|I was listening to this work the past days and really enjoyed.  Williams effectively uses the larger strings Cello/double bass with the contra bassoon in these works.  Some of the tunes he has the tenor horn and trombone in the forefront(very powerful).  He does have a way of setting moods and emotions.  I like his works. The best tunes are the Quiddich Match, Chess Match and Fluffy's harp.I was looking at the cover and nowhere does it say which orchestra he was conducting.  Perhaps it was a pickup orchestra?
B000067J1H|3.0|I had heard so much about David Fincher's popular 1999 film FIGHT CLUB that I felt that I owed myself to see what the big deal about this movie was about. Now that I have, my personal reaction can be summed up in this way: I respect the film's skill and style, but how were so many people sucked into swallowing this film whole? <br /> <br />Yes, this film is very well-made. Director David Fincher is a virtuoso film stylist, and he brings his hard-rock style to bear in this film even more than he did with the disturbing SEVEN. It is his unrelenting but occasionally exciting style, as well as the good performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, that carries you along through most of the movie: this is a movie that vibrates with fever and energy, and the first half-hour of the movie really does draw you into the Narrator's dead-end life. (The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is often strikingly gritty.) And it must be said that FIGHT CLUB is never boring. How can you be bored by a movie that is as unremittingly violent, both physically and mentally, than this one? Or with Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden, spouting off his magnetically anarchic gospel, telling us to rebel against all the lies we've been fed by, I guess, \\"the establishment\\"? In its own way, FIGHT CLUB is a gripping visceral achievement. <br /> <br />And yet, what does all this blood-stained machismo add up to in the end? To a blinding revelation that supposedly sheds new light on all that has gone before, and yet simply seems like something screenwriter Jim Uhls, adapting Chuck Palahniuk's book (which I haven't read), thought might be cool to throw in, following the lead of Christopher McQuarrie's big twist in THE USUAL SUSPECTS. But even that controversial twist seemed more, not less, convincing! Did people really actually take this film's big twist SERIOUSLY? Did they really buy it as easily as they apparently did? I shared Edward Norton's disbelief during the final stages: I wouldn't have believedit either. <br /> <br />It is really a shame the filmmakers here felt that they had to manipulate the audience in this manner (although apparently, based on this film's popularity, they succeeded). If FIGHT CLUB had been less concerned with plot tricks than with Norton's character and how he gets out of the rut he feels he's in with his life, this film might have been an immeasurably better film. For me, all the graphic violence and, later, the fascism of this film really blunted whatever message Fincher and Uhls are trying to convey here. I seriously cannot tell whether this film is meant to be an attack of Tyler Durden's gleeful anarchy or a celebration, so explicit and indulgent this movie is regarding the violence it purports to condemn. Really, this film would have been a lot more disturbing if FIGHT CLUB had focused on the Narrator and the changes he makes in his sad life, instead of being merely ugly and muddled. <br /> <br />As it is, FIGHT CLUB is an unfortunate mess of interesting ideas about rebelling against society buried under a lot of impressive filmmaking style and a lot of brutal violence. David Fincher is undoubtedly a talented filmmaker---his 1995 film SEVEN was an equally grisly but much more disturbingly effective serial-killer thriller---but this film is basically a triumph of style over substance. Though never boring, it is at heart a very stupid macho movie, and I am amazed that more people haven't seen right through its intellectual pretensions. Skip it.
B0000C1733|5.0|There have been many albums that has changed the music industry over the years and the energy and passion that the Red Hot Chili Peppers put into all their albums is reflected in this single disk.  The great works that have been given to us like, Parallel Universe, My Friends, Soul To Squeeze, Give It Away, Suck My Kiss, Higher Ground, Fortune Faded, and my personal favorite Under the Bridge.  The soothing strums of the guitar, the perfect timing of every drum hit, and the strong presence of the bass work together to make the best sound that talks to the soul.  If you do not currently have any RHCP albums, I suggest this album.  Once you listen to each song you will want to hear what you have been missing with all the prior albums up to this greatest hits disk.  Hopfully I have given you the informantion that you were seeking and enjoy the music.  Remember that the music was made to enjoy and relate to, and hopfully you can find some comfort in the songs that you trully think your life is leading to or maybe already living and wanting a way out.
B000068OCS|4.0|...and/or a widescreen TV with a killer sound system.<br /><br />Otherwise, in a smaller TV it's nowhere as powerful as seeing it in the theatre.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I bought the Special Edition DVD three days ago and began playing it at home, the sound was wierd so I checked the languages, I found out two english audiotracks (Dolby 5.1 Surrond and Mono). With 5.1 Arnold's .45 sounds like someone is sneezing and basically every effects' sound has been changed.  <br />      On the plus side the picture quality is great and the special features are even better, there's 2 trailers that you would see in a theater, 1 teaser which you would see on T.V. and 2 30 second long TV spots. There are also \\"terminated\\" scenes, two documentaries and the oringinal tratment. In my opinion a great movie got even greater.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is not merely a great film but an important one.  Granted, the majority of the population would find this harrowing film offputting, however, because drugs and addiction are so woven into the framework of our society it is important that this film be seen by as many people as possible.  When the film started, I didn't no where it was going.  Once it established it's rhythm, detailing the high highs and low lows of chemical dependency this film takes hold of you and doesn't let go.  Credit for this has to go to director Darren Aronofsky who establishes himself as a new and creative force in film-making.  It seems like this film was made a long time ago and I eagerly await viewing his next project(that said, I wasn't too partial to \\"PI\\").  The ensemble acting in this film is superb.  Jennifer Connelly is a stand-out as a heroine addict who ultimately succumbs to the worse kind of degradation to support her habit.  The ultimate praise, however, is reserved for Ellen Burstyn.  She not only gives a great performance but an acting performance for the ages.  Her character breaks your heart from start to finish.  The movie begins with her enabling her heroine addict son by allowing him to steal her beloved TV and ends with her being subjected to drug-treatment for becoming adicted to amphetamines because she wanted to look good for the all-important TV.  This is a great film whose reputation I hope only grows through the years.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|We make our lives in a time where the relentless commodification of everything has largely driven politically and artistically valuable popular culture underground. The fact that Springsteen can inspire artists like Spike Lee, Ani di Franco, Sean Penn and Ben Harper; issue uncompromising attacks on George Bush and the murderous racism of the New York Police Department; write a deeply empathetic song about a teenage suicide bomber in Palestine; be celebrated by academics as the contemporary avatar of the spirit of Whitman and Steinbeck and be the most enduringly popular musician in America is a remarkable achievement. It's an achievement that no one with any interest in rock music or the liberatory potential of popular culture can afford to ignore. <br /> <br />Springsteen produces music at something like the rate at which Pablo Neruda wrote poems. Some discographies list well over 400 songs and the last radio station to play the full Springsteen catalogue back to back had to dedicate 56 solid hours to the project. Getting a sense of his work is a big undertaking. The Essential Bruce Springsteen aims to make this a little easier. It is a well priced 30 track selection that draws from all 12 of Springsteen's studio albums as well as his most recent live album, Live in New York City. It comes with a 12 track bonus disk that includes a range of previously unreleased live performances and studio recordings stretching back from 2002 to 1979 as well as three songs from film soundtracks.  <br /> <br />Springsteen has conceptualized each of his albums with the same totality of care that a great director puts into a film. The songs on his albums always speak to each other and while they stand alone, sometimes magnificently, they cannot be fully understood by themselves. Trying to do that would be like fast forwarding through Apocalypse Now to find the good bits. The standard approach to consuming pornographic and gratuitously violent films might be an appropriate way to consume music produced as commercial entertainment but to fully appreciate Springsteen you have to, as with most music that transmutes experience into art, listen to the albums. Neither the visceral defiance of a song like Badlands, nor its assumption that happiness has to be founded on rebellion, can be fully comprehended without investing equal attention in the other nine songs on Darkness on the Edge of Town. Factory describes men walking through factory gates in the rain with 'death in their eyes' and warns that 'somebody's going to get hurt tonight'. But that doesn't mean that a good collection of individual songs isn't a welcome guide to deeper appreciation. <br /> <br />There just isn't space to fit all the Springsteen songs usually considered as essential on two disks and so songs like Stolen Car, Racing in the Street, Factory, This Hard Land and the blues version of Born in the U.S.A. aren't here. But the 30 tracks give a good account as any of the development of Springsteen's work over the years and certainly replace the now dated Greatest Hits album as the definitive Springsteen collection. The surprises are all on the bonus disk which includes tracks in which Springsteen explores the outer reaches of his art with a falsetto voice, an E string turned down to a dark D, drum loops and folk sounds considerably rootsier than those that haunt Nebraska. There are genuinely sublime moments. But the live performances often feel like bootleg recordings of a solid performance of a good song on an ordinary night. They always rock but often don't reach much beyond that. <br /> <br />The decision not to spread the overview of Springsteen's work over three disks rather than two is surprising. The decision to include work likely to appeal to the serious fan in a project aimed at the newer or more casual fan who is unlikely to be riveted at the thought of a country blues version of Countin' on a Miracle or a rocking but not transcendent twenty year old live performance of a Jimmy Cliff cover is also surprising.  <br /> <br />But in a world where Justin Timberlake is called an artist innovation is very surprising. There is something very attractive about the decision to include some more experimental work and some well crafted but not extraordinary live performances. After all most great artists move ahead of their audience at times and simultaneously keep some kind of contact with the essentials of their craft. The recognition of this on the bonus disk ensures that this collection presents Springsteen as he is - a working artist - rather than as another product carefully calibrated for maximum ease and rate of consumption. The Essential Bruce Springsteen offers far more of the truth about the spirit and achievements of Springsteen than, say, a more commercial album like Legend offers about the spirit and achievements of Bob Marley. <br /> <br />The Essential Bruce Springsteen shows that the that radical doesn't have to be marginal and the popular doesn't have to be crap.  <br /> <br />No retreat baby, no surrender.
B00001IVR0|5.0|I would echo what the other reviewer said of this record: this is definitely one of the best Brahms if not the very best. And this is so on the account of both the painist and the conductor. Meanwhile, I have heard a few other perfomances side by side including Arrau/Haitink, Gilels/Jochum,  Brendel/Hintink and even Karin Lechner/Marturet etc.    This was not the only collaboration between Backhaus and Bohm even on Brahms No. 2.  Here Bohm is most extraordinary, not only his Brahms but also his Mozart, so that both pieces in both parts are equally inspiring. The balance between the piano and orchestra is by far the best and there is a special chesmistry between the two, so that there is a lot of poetry on top of music.  Suffice to say that this record offers a most gratifying musical experience that is now almost extinct.     There is a saying that if we are looking for excitement from Brahms, one should turn to his Hungarian music, or perhaps to a lesser degree his No. 1 Piano Concerto written some twenty earlier, at a time when Schumann passed away and he himself in a turmoil.  No. 2  we is essentially involved with the inspirations he incepted from the beauty of the Alps when he was approaching 50: when he was steady and mature enough.  Well, perhaps such background doesn't show,  and doesn't count at all: great music is open to all kinds of interpretation after all.    Yet in view of such a background, criticism against Arrau's tempo or overall approach is hardly sustainable. The truth is, the performance as quoted is most satisfying, a perfect model for exams and competitions.  Note particularly his beautiful tone, and his  phrasings, so much so that all his notes are meaningful, each one of them, quite ready for first instance digestion. There was renowned Russian conductor who found Richter \\"oppressive\\" and in Arrau a living Brahms years after he had accompanied both pianists on Brahms.    Gilels wasn't quite as \\"oppressive\\" as Richter albeit both were demanding, each in their own way. But the emphasis on the whole range as well as on each and every voice on the piano, armed with his sheer masculinity. That often put Jochum in a awkward position. Being a authoritative Bruchnerian, Jochum knew full well what this masculinity is about. Probably he did not quite agree with the pianist, and he was so busy rounding off such effects with the orchestra- and he has done it with so much grace. With respect, Brendel/Haitink is the least satisfying of all, that is to say including Karin, who simply lacks masculinity.    However, take note that not everyone would readily appreciate Backhaus' greatness right away. His playing ( or recreation if you like) often baffles you at first, posing a lot of questions to you. It at first puzzles one as to why Mozart Concerto no. 27 was to be played that way, and even more so his Brahms. And the result is, we have to go deeper and deeper into the score and the background etc.     But the remastered sound is really superb so that you will clearly hear the grandioso sound of the Bosendorfer he was playing, and you will note the subtle balance of his left hand part and when the pedel was on and the effects that he was painting etc.    It is also noteworthy that Martha Argerich (Gulda's pupil), after she has become one of the world's top most pianist, remarked that she particularly found Backhaus amongst all recorded masters of the piano instructive ( not Rubinstein, not Richter.)  And Idel Biret ( famous Naxos artist & Kempff's pupil)  finds Backhaus' Brahms the golden yardstick.    Last but not the least, the record is IN STEREO. So are Backhaus' Decca Beethoven Sonatas ( all with the exception of one ). The recorded sound of the sonatas are almost, but not quite as good as this one as remastered.

B0000029GA|5.0|I've been a fan of nas from I am... but i had to go back and listen to his old work and i admit that this album is definitely one of the greatest of all time next to the chronic and ready to die.nas maintains that grimey flow with clever street poetry, not none of that ja rule and nelly sh**.Nasty Nas is da Illest.QB stand up!!
0425152251|5.0|I have received a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and served as the President of the Philosophical Society for many semesters.  I have recommended this book to anyone interested in Philosophy who desires to get their feet wet!  I was first introduced to this wonderful book my freshmen year in an intro class and it is definitely the greatest \\"text\\" book ever!  It gives an overview of the history of philosophy and it does it in a very entertaining manner.  It also includes a very helpful glossary in the back of the book, so you can look up different philosophers or important ideas (if you need a refresher)!
B000005L86|5.0|I lied....Ten Stars......this is what you will be listening as St Peter decides your fate.. and there will be no better way to go.... the vocal harmonies alone would suffice but as for the outstanding session band and the 'scratch' production.. if it takes madness to produce music like this let insanity rule. I got the original on vinyl import in 79, the Beat's 'Go Feet' uk imprint a few years later and this version in both its vinyl and cd offerings i'll take any more that float by, even have some slates with dubs of the various tracks.. almost certainly the best reggae record ever made probably one of the best 10 or 12 of any genre, these days this hogs my iPod, if it did everything the label said.. the label would be a billboard
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This fourth album of Britney Spears most certainly launches her into the 21 and over category. In The Zone is a provacative, tintillating record that makes it clear that Ms. Spears is all grown up. With such tracks as \\"Touch of My Hand\\", \\"Early Morning\\" and \\"Breathe On Me\\", she clearly states her matured sexuality. <br /> <br />Although she might have mentally and physically grown up, her voice doesn't seem to have changed all that much since \\"...Baby One More Time\\". Her alto voice becomes breathy when she wants it to be which seems to happen quite a bit. Except for \\"Everytime\\", which has been viewed by many as a personal song for the singer, most of the tracks seem to have been specifically written for the club and party scene in mind and not for a serious dialogue on life. \\"Toxic\\" is by far the best song on the album. <br /> <br />Leaving her personal life aside, I personally enjoy listening to Britney to dance or party to, but I wouldn't count this one among her top records.
B00005YXZH|1.0|According to almost every form of media I can think of I should love Wilco, all the 5 star reviews hailing them as the saviors of rock and the best indie band around...I like indie rock and am happy that it is beginning to become somewhat popular so these pop crap kids can listen to something of substance.  This however is boring, uninteresting, banal, whatever you can think of to say it didn't entertain me.  I could listen to this until my ears bled and not feel a tenth of the emotion expressed by truly great bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate and Death Cab for Cutie.  For some real music, check out Modest Mouse's albums (all of them), The Killers, Simon and Garfunkel, the above mentioned Sunny Day Real Estate and Death Cab for Cutie, The Clash, Operation Ivy, and Neutral Milk Hotel are all great for real music lovers, not lovers of comatose inducing slop passing as music like this.  Peace
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Im reading these reviews listed before mine and I cant believe how many people didnt like this movie.  Mind you, I am a huge Josh Hartnett Fan so I pretty much enjoy anything I see him in but I thought Pearl Harbor was a wonderful movie.  Its actually one of my Favorte movies.  No one could ever capture that day in Dec,1941 exactly the way it happened so I thought that the directors did an excellent job portraying it.  Im a sucker for a good love story too so that definitly made me love the movie more.  As far as the people on here saying the movie sucked, \\"You probably wouldnt know a good movie if it hit you in the face\\"!!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|You guys who are reviewing this and saying womens wrestling is pointless, and it is a real disgrace. Wrestling is not just a mens sport ok, get it through your empty heads. You guys are giving reviews saying its only good for the \\"T&A\\" which is absoultely disgusting and you need to realize that. Maybe if the WWE wasnt sexist towards women and didnt hire them based on their looks, theyd have better female wrestlers. I find the female matches better and more exciting instead of the repetitive male ones.
0812513509|5.0|In some ways, this book was even more enjoyable than Ender's Game, and that is saying a LOT.  Speaker for the Dead seems to be a lot more of a mature read to me for several reasons.  One being that Ender himself is more mature and confidant and so his thought processes and actions have more depth behind them..  Ender is almost like some kind of \\"holy man\\" in this book while in Ender's Game he was more of a depressed little boy.  Actually, I thought that the whole concept of this book was cool as hell even though I was a bit skeptical at first learning about the \\"Piggies\\"..  but even they turned out to be interesting.  I'd actually go as far as to say that this is the best book by Card that I've read thus far.  Really looking forward to Xenocide!
B0000009SM|5.0|One Size Fits All was the second Zappa record I ever heard and I have been hooked ever since.  It remains one of my favorite studio albums ever, containing some of the best material in the Zappa repertoire.   <br /> <br />The album begins with \\"Inca Roads,\\" a beautiful conglommeration of some of the most pleasing sounds to ever penetrate my cochlea.  The melody, sung precisley by George Duke, is a sunny affair with bright, wide, open intervals (like the perfect fifth from the 5th to the 9th of \\"...from somewhere out there)that seem to encourage the listener to accept the challenge of singing along - a task that becomes increasingly formidable as Frank employs his crafty rhthmic devices (like his groupings of fives: \\"Did a vehicle did a vehicle,\\" \\"Guacamole Qeen Guacamole Queen\\" and the later groups of five and six: Did a Booger-bear come from somewhere out there did a Booger-bear come from somewhere...\\").  The frantic 7/4 section puts all of the cheesy 70's fusion crapola like Return to Forever and even Weather Report to shame.  Chester Thompson is so much better with Zappa than with Weather Report.  George Duke takes an amazing solo here.  I think Zappa brought out the best in Duke as well.   <br /> <br />Every track on this record is a winner.  My other favorites are \\"Florentine Pogen\\" and \\"Andy\\" and, of course, \\"Sofa #1\\" and \\"Sofa #2.\\"   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the gift that Frank Zappa has given to you.
B000002O03|4.0|Debut album from raunchy boys of the South. Lynyrd rocks the way ABB rocks except their songs are of shorter nature. Jamming is not as essential to Skynyrd as is to ABB. For only Freebird, let alone the others, this album is essential. I Ain't the One is the very first song in the cd and it is cleverly penned and composed. Tuesday's Gone is prone to many covers. It is a slow one. Gimme Three Steps is humorous. Simple Man is another slow number. Things Goin' On has anti-Semitist lyrics.  <br />
B00005221M|5.0|I am reading the novel \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" right now, and I am struck by how stilted and verbose is Cooper's writing. This film, however, succeeds in capturing the essence of the period with its interaction between great European powers, colonials, and rival Indian tribes. The dialogue is sparse and believable (unlike the novel's horrific dialogue, in which Magua et al apparently are transplanted 16th century Englishmen). The action scenes are beautifully filmed (watch carefully and observe the many different camera angles used to show 5 seconds of action). The score is dramatic, sweeping, in a word - majestic. All high school history teachers should show this film to their students during lectures on the French and Indian War, for this will enliven a historical period like nothing else can! This movie is unbelievable.  <br />      I will echo the complaints of some of the other critics about the lack of special features on the DVD - it truly is unfortunate. Let's be honest, though: the added scenes, though deserving of their deleted status, do not exert enough influence to destroy the cinematic experience, as one viewer stated. The removal of the Clannad song was inexcusable, however. Nonetheless, this is one of the greatest films of all time. Do yourself a favor - burn the book and buy the movie.
B0000024ZT|4.0|This is the debut album from the Boss. Blinded by the Light and Growin' Up are the two sweet tracks. Mary Queen of Arkansas is a slow one. Lost in the Flood is the harbinger of what is to come on BORN TO RUN album. For You is my favorite track. Spirit in the Night is like a jazz piece. The last track tells how it is hard to be a saint in the city.  <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Before I start, I'd like to point out the fact that Maynard did not write this record, this record was written by A Perfect Circle, which is composed of many musical geniuses rather than only one. Maynard should be credited for the lyrical and vocal progression. While Billy Howerdel should be credited for the strange guitar progressions, also some of the lyrical and vocal. As well as Jeordie White to be credited for bass and Josh Freese to be credited for drums. I believe James Iha didn't play on the record, but he is part of the band's live act.<br /><br />A Perfect Circle's \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is nothing short of fantastic and amazing. Though comparing \\"Thirteenth Step\\" to it's predecessor, \\"Mer de Noms,\\" would be unfair for the sheer fact that different styles are uniquely incorporated into each record. Clearly, \\"Mer de Noms\\" is the harder and more brutal side of A Perfect Circle. The change of style is no surprise considering the change of the lineup of the band. The departure of Paz Lenchantin and Troy Van Leeuwen is recognizable. \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is easily perceived as a dreamier and more mellow record than \\"Mer de Noms\\", excluding tracks such as \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"Pet.\\" I also believe that the quality of \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is obviously much more perfectly layered rather than \\"Mer de Noms.\\" But enough of comparing, let's get to the record.<br /><br />The record starts with a dreamy guitar riff by Billy Howerdel in \\"The Package,\\" clearly this song depicts the sickness of addiction (most likely of drugs). As the song progresses, it gets into more of a \\"Mer de Noms\\" feel, while maintaining it's dreamy tone. As far as lyrics, Maynard's nothing short of great on this. Josh sort of brings out a tribal feel on the drums. Troy contributed to this track.<br /><br />As the record continues, the first single, \\"Weak and Powerless,\\" starts out. This song has an awesome bass riff and some excellent guitar work along with great vocals. The drums are nothing short of great either. The meaning of the song lies somewhere between the obsession with something, preferably drugs in this case, as the whole album lies within the whole \\"getting clean\\" process.<br /><br />After \\"Weak and Powerless\\" comes my favorite song perhaps, \\"The Noose.\\" Danny Lohner contributed to this track by playing guitar and you can clearly get a sort of Nine Inch Nails feel to it. The drum techniques are excellent and sequential. The bass work is just as good. I believe this song was also released as a single, though I haven't paid much attention to that.<br /><br />After the shocking finish of \\"The Noose\\", comes \\"Blue,\\" the second single off of the record, though the band never released a video for it. This song is obviously about the \\"getting high\\" process that drugs create and is an excellent mix of dreamy techniques on guitar and bass, creating a sort of depreciating mood.<br /><br />\\"Vanishing\\" is by far the most eerie song on the album, musically speaking. But an insane combination of excellent musicianship. Not too many lyrics, but the music makes up for that.<br /><br />\\"A Stranger\\" is a beautiful acoustic track perhaps dealing with the mystery and risk of trust. The lyrics are probably the most effective on this track. Strings can be heard on the track also, resulting in a beautiful track with excellent musicianship.<br /><br />\\"The Outsider\\" is the third single off of the record, however it has a video. The video is pretty interesting in my case, I don't mind it, something easy on the eyes to watch. Though the song is different, with the strongest lyrics on the album. Not to mention the grungy feel of the guitarwork. Perhaps Maynard's best vocal work on the album also.<br /><br />Can't say much about \\"Crimes\\" really, it doesn't appeal to me as much as other tracks on the album, but still a pretty good listen, more of an intermission from what's going on.<br /><br />\\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is a slow and lush track filled with more melody than the song can handle. Though a sort of boring listen to many, it definitely appeals to me. Beautiful lyrics in this as well, not to mention the vocals which are soothing to listen to.<br /><br />\\"Pet\\" is a strong, creative, distorted, violent, and angry track. Creating a dark image of something like war perhaps? I'm not too sure about the meaning of this song. However, I'm not too sure it has to have too much depth to it either, but considering the fact that Maynard wrote the lyrics, it probably does.<br /><br />\\"Lullaby\\" is an instrumental followup to \\"Pet\\" that uses the same melody, though much softer, a lot like \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"Crimes.\\" I could only conclude that this song is an intermission as well. But that's my opinion, it might have a meaning to it. It may just be a simply eerie lullaby that follows up to \\"Pet.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gravity\\" was definitely not one of my favorite tracks, but as time grew, so did my affection for this song. The song is a definitely calming and soothing finish to such a great and powerful album. Indeed the musicianship on this is excellent as well. APC stated that this album was about drugs and being addicted to them, and this is the so called \\"finish\\" to it. This is where the person decides to come clean. Not sure if that person's Maynard, but it must have been part of his life. Strong lyrics, and indeed \\"I choose to live.\\"<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong, this is the best album that was released in 2003, and no surprise on how great it is. However, I still think it should have had 13 tracks considering the name, but either way I'm happy. It makes me look forward to Tool's next album. If you have some money on you, definitely get this album if you're looking for something. ...And if you don't, then borrow it from a friend. You can't go wrong.han the song can handle.

B000002KB8|5.0|Where heavy metal begins its journey.A classic. The title song opens with the sound of a rainy day. As a first, this fell into the rock community as a solid stone. Many were amazed at this experimentation by the metal pioneers. They say Led Zeppelin is another pioneer of heavy metal but there is a difference. Black Sabbath made a thoroughly metallic album. On the other hand Led Zep burst on the metal scene with only a few songs of the genre called heavy metal. <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|i don't understand why people try so hard to underrate it but here we have one of the most influential albums of all times.as it had happened to velvet underground in the early seventies,nirvana is appreciated by musicians like Tori Amos,Macy Gray,Orhan Gencebay and bands like the strokes,brmc,prodigy and so on.as a music fan this album still makes me think of starting my own band,expressing my anger to the new world order.anyway real music fans will always enjoy this music and Nevermind will be put to its well deserved place someday.because it's been more than 10 years since it was released and it sounds STILL as if it was released today.
B000002KHH|5.0|Where heavy metal continues its journey. Another classic. War Pigs is a classic. Paranoid another one. Paranoid was thought to be an album filler but now look where it takes its position in the metal scene. Planet Caravan is astonishingly slow and makes wonder why this slow song is included in such a metal album. But it adds flavor of some kind, admittedly. Iron Man is changeable, that is : like other songs in the album there is some kind of progression. Fairies Wear Boots. Yes i saw with my own two eyes. <br />
B000000H4V|5.0|If I was trapped on a desert island and could only take three albums this would be one of them. This album has so many great aspects to it, it's impossible to write about them all. There are a few personal highlights including    - Kaiowas, a acoustic 'tribal' jam. How many Brazillian people or bands have focused indigenous issues (see Biotech is Godzilla)or used them as inspiration in Brazillian music? This got a little cheesy with the whole Sepultribe thing however this is makes the album a little different, and I'd argue special, compared with most metal albums.    - Biotech is Godzilla co-written w/ Jello Biafra. A full on attack of the pharmasutcial industry and its exploitative nature. Well the title says it all     - Manifest (sic). This documents the violent exercises of the Brazillian police in the Caranderu prison massacre in Sao Paulo state; there's a photo to boot which isn't plesant. This is also addressed in the above tune.     To top it off there's the unbelievable bass playing (Paulo Jr)and the brazillian informed drumming which is simply brilliant (Igor Cavalera). This album has it all. It's a politically motivated, undeniably cohesive, agressive metal fest. Sepultura brought this type of metal to a wider audience, including me. This is their crowning moment and one the greatest heavy metal albums ever.
B000005RQT|5.0|This is one of the masterpieces of the band. On the cd front cover the band members are depicted as carved into the mountain Rushmore. Cool faces. In the original cd there are first 7 tracks. I have the 25th anniversary edition with 20 tracks. Additional tracks are fun. Admittedly i hate Child in Time. Many people like that song. Speed King maybe pointed the way to Highway Star. I am not sure. Jam Stew [Unreleased Instrumental] is high up in tempo with guitar ripping and drumming. <br />
B00020HEL6|5.0|The self-titled \\"Renee Olstead\\" is a musical luxury item of the finest quality. It far outdistances anything else this year in terms of joy and comfort it brings. If it were up to me this album would win Renee an armload of Grammy's.
B000003CMC|4.0|This album is the last Duane Allman album. This album shines with One Way Out and it is a cover. Ain't Wastin' Time No More, the opener, is a good song. Les Brers in A Minor is a great instrumental, opening slow and going fast. Mountain Jam is a boring, very long jam. Melissa by Gregg Allman is a nice ballad. Blue Sky is also a good number from the Bros. All others are mediocre tracks to me but it is arguable. <br />
B00005176F|5.0|This awesome CD contains all of Blur's hits.A must have for all Blur fans.Brit Pop at its best.
B000002VJH|3.0|This album has a weird name.It is a nice album but slow paced. The opening title is very sweet. It has 2 parts coming one after another. I have listened to that song live and believe me you can not distinguish between the two. These guys are great when it comes to live jamming. The second song is good but not their best. I particularly like The Music Never Stopped. King Solomon's Marbles, Pts. 1 & 2 is another good song. <br />
0345446798|5.0|I wish I had known about this book three years ago, when we first got our Ridgeback mix puppy... he is now three years old, and although we love him, he is hell on wheels!  I have read other books that didn't help and even attended an eight week group obedience class (the first session we were actually asked to leave until we got a \\"halti\\" for the dog) not a great experience at all... <br />I have learned more useful, practical information from this book (I am only on page 47) - and we can already see the dog's behavior changes by degrees.  This book gives a whole new paradign about communicating with & understanding the dog.  I was appalled at how many things we were doing wrong, I actually feel sorry for the dog now, rather than being mad at him.  <br />And for the crowning glow, I find myself laughing often while reading this book.  Worth it's weight in gold, I highly reccomend this book to ANYONE who wants to have a better life with their dog.
B000002P74|5.0|The album opens with the legendary 'Sweet Home Alabama' [sweet home alabama , where the skies are so blue]- a genius piece by Ronnie Van Zant. The following song 'I need You' takes the rhythm down, i do not like its position in the playlist. Don't Ask Me No Questions and Workin For Mca rock. Mca is the new label of the band. The Ballad Of Curtis Loew is about a white haired black man who has recently died. Swamp Music is a rocker. The Needle And The Spoon tells about the damages of the drug addiction. Call Me The Breeze is a J.J.Cale cover.This last song is my favorite.  <br /> <br />
B0002DB52M|5.0|Lars is one  of the most incredible working artist alive.  I have been eaten alive by him since Zentropa.  Bergman, Strindberg, von Trier.  Its about being human.  It is about the truth.  It is about life.
B000002KHB|5.0|This is a hardrocking studio masterpiece by one of my favorite bands. With Highway Star you are taken to a truck on the highway and believe me you feel you are inside that truck speeding and you are the king of the road. The second, third and fourth songs are not as good as the memorable riff of Smoke On the Water. Lazy and Space Truckin' rock hard as they jam. People keep on saying that the riff of Smoke on the Water is a mark in metal community. Space Truckin' is to be covered by OVERKILL in their Coverkill album. <br />
038551123X|3.0|As a big fan of Bradley Denton's \\"Blackburn\\" and \\"One Day Closer to Death,\\" the idea of a serial killer who actually works for the police was quite intriguing. While Dexter was an interesting character (his back story involving his adopted father was very well done), the remaining characters were very shallow and contrived and the ending was very, very weak (more like a movie of the week or \\"Days of Our Lives\\"). <br />I am curious to see some more of Dexter, but more work is needed on plotting and supoporting cast.
B000002KJM|5.0|ZZ Top's First Album. Great but not as great as the southern rockers from Georgia, Macon. (Somebody Else Been) Shaking Your Tree is a very nice composition. Brown Sugar is the name given to black beautiful women. Squank is another hard rocking song. Neighbor, Neighbor is another one of my favorites of this album. Backdoor Love Affair is about a man's backdoor adventures.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon and his immensely talented \\"Firefly\\" cast and crew have created magic and legend.  From the opening sequence, shiny bluegrass riffs ripple through the action like runoff from a desert rain (my first clue that I was going to love this show).  Whedon is a master at blending action and emotion, humor and pathos, sheer quirky fun and thought-provoking drama.  In bewteen taking on risky jobs for pay or principle, Serenity's crew and passengers play no-holds-barred basketball in the cargo bay and gather around the scarred wooden table in the galley to laugh and swap tall tales.

B00005ASOC|2.0|Bill Cosby's recent controversial remarks, in fact echoing those of Malcolm X, have been received with politically correct derision. Here is a movie whose theme emphasizes the rewards, as well as the agonies, attendant upon an American black youngster breaking into the academic world. Though I am generally opposed to movies that carry a propaganda message (and profoundly so to those that continue to portray blacks as victims), we are so desperately in need of positive black role models (instead of those that pay fawning homage to 'street culture'), that I applaud the intent of this movie. <br /> <br />Unfortunately I can't agree with the majority of critics that the Jamal Wallace character is convincing. Rob Brown, who plays him, is utterly miscast and emanates a deep and sullen dullness in a role that needed a character capable of hinting at essential brilliance, concealed beneath an unpromising and protective exterior. To me the unpromising exterior remains intact for the duration.  <br /> <br />Connery, as usual, shows his versatility, but I don't see this as even near his best work - he seems not to have his heart in it and I can't blame him. Jamal, by the way, since he checked the professor's use of 'farther' when he should have used 'further' might have usefully caught out the erudite Forrester using 'phenomena' when he meant 'phenomenon'! But a movie cannot be better than its screenplay and I'd say that is another weakness here. <br />
B000001F7E|4.0|The title track is of Ron Wood and Stewart. \\"every picture tells a story\\" verse is repeated 23 times towards the end of the song. A nice one. ' That's All Right' is a great RnR song. This one was sung also by the GRATEFUL DEAD. 'Maggie May, one of Stewart's hits (by Stewart/Quittenton) is just before the Stewart penned 'Mandolin Wind'. Tim Hardin's 'Reason To Believe' ends the album. The album is well organized and ranks among Stewart's early classic rock albums. Might be a good place to start listening to some classic rock. Stewart not only as the singer, but as a song-writer shows one of his best.  <br />

These guys enhance their horizon with constantly changing tempos.The masterful Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener opens the scene followed by Tomorrow's Dream. FX is nothing but a string of sound effects. Supernaut is a powerful rocker, my fav. Snowblind is a classic. Carnucopia means a horn dressed with fruits. St. Vitus Dance is an uptempo song. This album is the place where progressive engages metal. <br />

B00005JLEX|5.0|Man, how does one go about reviewing one of the greatest t.v. shows ever?  In a few hundred words, no less! <br /> <br />There has been a lot of talk about the 'genius' of \\"Seinfeld\\".  The show was built on one simple philosophy: real life is the best comedy.  I once heard a comedian expound by saying that the funniest man can sit around and make up hilarious jokes all day long, but nothing will hit a homerun like something that has happened in your everyday life that other ordinary people can relate to.  (This is why \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" is so big, and it goes back to Lucy.)  Seinfeld took normal events and spun them into oddly-familiar but wacky plots.  Similarly, each [main] character was someone we could identify with -- although hopefully not completely. <br /> <br />I think that's genius point A: to take reality (a.k.a., \\"nothing\\") and tweak it into something to laugh to until it hurt. <br /> <br />Genius point B is thus:  every show featured a \\"woven together\\" theme.  Each character's individual storyline eventually somehow managed to end up interacting with the other respective pieces.  Two episodes step into mind straight off:  1) when George started doing the opposite of his instinct and went \\"up\\" while misfortune befell Elaine and she went \\"down\\" and Jerry ended up \\"even\\" in-between them; 2) when George lost his keys in the pothole and had to jackhammer them out, meanwhile Elaine pretended to be a janitor - and at one point they pass on the street and nod knowingly about their fake jobs.  This was beautifully illustrated in the final episode when it all came back around and their selfishness kicked them in the collective butt. <br /> <br />Of course they were greedy, selfish and sometimes downright nasty... that's why they were funny.  They were everyday people carried to the extreme.  They were the personified exhibitions of many of the fears and thoughts that we bury in the real world. <br /> <br />That leads into genius point C:  the characters were amazingly well-crafted, individually and as an ensemble.  To illustrate this, look beyond the obvious top 4.  How many shows can you name more than a couple supporting characters for?  \\"Seinfeld\\" has the parents, J. Peterman, Puddy, Jackie Chiles, Newman, the Soup Nazi, Joe Mayo and so on for a mile.  They played at varying levels of importance -- some recurring, some in 1 or 2 episodes -- but we remember each vividly.  That is amazing. <br /> <br />\\"Seinfeld\\" certainly was not the first great comedy and it will not be the last, but it will forever hold a firm place as one of the big ones.  Not everyone will agree on that, naturally, but the majority sure does and credit should be given to all involved for that gift.  And now that we have the DVDs we can watch them ad nauseum, which will in turn make us fan[atics] profoundly happy, which will mean \\"Seinfeld\\" is doing something quite unexpected... benefiting the world!

B00005JN2X|3.0|Collateral is not a bad flick.  That is a difficult thing to say, considering that Tom Cruise is one of the most annoying actors in Hollywood today.  However, as the antagonist, he performs his role incredibly well.  In fact, all the actors deserve kudos for what was a great series of performances.   <br /> <br />Based primarily on dialogue, the screenplay is a good variation on the hit-man genre of cookie cutter movie production.  This movie is different; it has the same basic plot of movies that go back to films like \\"Day of the Jackal.\\" <br />  <br />I say this movie is worth seeing, though it starts off a little slow.   <br />
0385659806|4.0|Unlike some of the recent novels I have read, this book does not rely on sentimental journeys into the past: the 1960's or the 1970's. The prose is crisp and the descriptions are specific. Working in mental health, I was pleased to see that the narrator's likes, dislikes and behaviours were not overly explained and were treated more as eccentricities. The story was acutely respectful without seeming 'politically correct'. The fact that the narrator may or may not be autistic was not the key factor to the novel and that made it all the more refreshing. Basically - it was a good story, well written and unique. I would recommend it to everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
6303347657|4.0|The plot is lame:  a shy, introverted banker transforms into a party animal extraordinaire just by donning an ancient Nordic mask.  And not only does this guy know how to partay, he transcends the physical realm and enters cartoon invincibility.  Throw in a bad guy who happens also to be interested in the mask, along with the shy banker's love interest, mix with a night club that plays nauseating big band music from the Forties, and we have a recipe for a flop, right?<br /><br />Wrong!  THE MASK is able to sweep all of its annoying flaws under the rug by the sheer comic energy of Jim Carrey.  And did I say energy?  Carrey throws himself into the lead role with all the subtlety of a Cat IV storm; he yells, screams, jumps, runs, bounces, dances, sings, and makes enough facial expressions to earn a padded room.  The comedian puts this film on his attention deficit shoulders and carries it firmly from possible disaster to grinning entertainment.  And did I say grinning?  Well, I actually meant laughing, because Carrey is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud from his first zany appearance to his last.<br /><br />A young Cameron Diaz looks good, and doesn't get in the way of Carrey's comic tantrums.  Her legs alone are worth 4 stars.  And so is THE MASK.<br /><br />--D. Mikels

B000002NHN|5.0|Like many listeners, I was introduced to Loreena McKennitt through this album, after hearing the radio remix of The Mummer's Dance.  And it is, to date, her most accessible, IMO, for new listeners who have not encountered her brand of enchanted melody.  It remains my second favorite McKennitt album, after THE VISIT.<br /><br />Album highlights include the studio version of the Mummer's Dance, of course.  My favorite recording here, though, is the epic, 14-minute version of Alfred Noyes \\"The Highwayman.\\"  The story is high romantic adventure and tragedy, and McKennitt's scoring of the music tot he events of the poem is masterful.

B000274THQ|5.0|The obvious reaction of any Westerner is that of most reviewers of this movie: seeing it as a comedy, where the weight and meat of the critique points out at the former socialist system, among many other things. This is what the film shows, isn't it?    Most definitely.    This is what we see in the movie for sure. But at the end of it all, what is the meaning behind all those images and dialogues?    As someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in Romania and was in Germany during those early nineties, the perception is different.    Sure the standards of living in the East and West were as different as night and day. This is no secret, and one doesn't need a new movie, especially the Germans, to remind them of that. Retro-propaganda - \\"look how bad, how pathetic it all was\\"? Come on.    The real question is how much of the message in the movie points out at the inability of the new system, the capitalist one, to at least try to create an ideal world.     Alex's mom shock can't come from the ideological differences between the two systems. Most of the reviewers missed this. The hint is right there in the movie: the principal sacks her specifically because of her idealistic views.    But ideology is not juxtaposable with idealism. In fact, the differences are astronomical.    She wasn't a party ideologue. She was \\"just\\" an idealist.    Her son knew her vital need for an ideal world, or at least for a world that is striving towards an ideal.The system change would have robbed her of that hope.    The end of the movie has a symbolic meaning, and it applies to all former socialist countries: there was a trade off. And for the most part is for the better. Something irreplaceable though died.    The Germans, at least those in the former East, along with the rest of the Eastern block countries, don't need a Michael Moore style critique to get the message: this IS as good as it gets
B00004XMV6|5.0|I first found out about 9 1/2 weeks when I saw a small clip of it on a movie website. It was the scene where John blindfolds and seduces Elizabeth with an ice cube. I was so aroused on by that scene I decided I would find out somemore about the movie. Some described it as a beautiful blue movie. While other described it as sadistic and degrading to women. I decided I would check it out for myself. So I did, and after I watched it I found I had similar feelings that I had after watching Secratary. I longed so badly be in a relationship like the one in the movie. I was sooo turned on by many of the scenes in the movie, esspecially the scene where John and Elizabeth are making passionate love in the ally in the rain. I found myself quite aroused by the idea of being the submissive one, and not knowing what was going to happen next. Some of you hear I kow might be disgusted that I would find the Slave/Master idea erotic, but maybe you should keep your mind open to new thing and not be so quick to pass judgement. Who knows, maybe you'll find you like the idea of not being in control. You'll never know until you try!! ;)
1573228737|5.0|The first two thirds of Affinity reminded a great deal of The Snake Pit by Mary Jane Ward, a novel from the point of view of a woman in a sanitarium recovering from a nervous breakdown. But by the middle of second act, as Margaret Prior researches mysticism, the blandness of her life and the lives of the inmates begins to reveal pent up emtions. Under the guise of communion with the \\"spirits\\" Affinity spirals into a story filled with sexual tension, intrigue and madness. I was so caught up in Margaret's emotions that I completely missed Selena's devious playing of all the people in her life to ultimately win her freedom and prove in the process that she really did deserve her sentence in Millbank!

From the gawky white ultra geek who thinks he's down to the so perky you want to strangle her receptionist, he really captures what its like in white collar America these days.  And to top it off the films filled with classic, quotable lines (\\"Why should I have to change my name?  Michael Bolton's the one who sucks\\").  This flick towers over most of the stuff being put out today that's called comedy.
B00005A46T|4.0|Fact of the matter is THIS IS NOT THE HEAVIEST, THIS IS NOT DEATH METAL, THIS IS NOT THRASH METAL, THIS IS NOT BETTER THAN SLAYER, AND THIS IS NOT HEAVY! They are ok live, but they aren't as heavy live as they are on the CD. Death Metal bands always sound better live then on CD. Corey screams are not unique at all. See the lead singer for Demon Hunter, he screams way louder than Corey. Nu-Metal kids need to understand that they really do have probably the easiest to play metal ever. It's very simplistic. The drummer isn't all that great, I mean after 1 year and a half you can play this well. You wanna hear drumming? Then listen to Nile, Cryptopsy, and Origin. Slipknot's lyrical capabilities go into question as well like why ooze hatred and chaos, misanthropy and societal malaise when you have no alternatives? Ummmmmmmm...yeah. 'Iowa' is a fantastic metal record, ferocious and inventive, but their rage is that of psychotic adolescents rather than reasoning adults. Nu-Metal kids would never understand or be able to take a death metal band. The onslaught from bands like Suffocation, Nile, Cryptopsy, Origin, Meshuggah, and Strapping Young Lad would crush you and leave slipknot in the dust. You just wuldn't be able to handle or take it. Sorry but that is fact. Listen to slipknot ok, that's fine, but don't go masquerading as a death metal head and claiming you listen to the heaviest band ever, because slipknot is not that band, nor are they even death metal. they are nu-metal.

B00005JL9B|5.0|For the longest time I had been desparately trying to find a copy of Battle Royale. Finally I just decided to download it off of Kazaa. Let me tell you this is probably one of the most improtant films ever made. If you were to take Lord of the Flies, A Clockwork Orange, Stephen King's The Long Walk and The Running Man, and The Most Dangerous Game of All you would get Battle Royale. the movie really got to me for two reasons: One, seeing all those kids being pinned against one another made me feel like that was me and one of my highschool classes, I don't think I would have the heart to kill the kids that I grew up with. Two, the violence in the movie is portrayed as violence should be: cruel, unforgiving, and irreversible. None of the violence is glorifed of made to look cool. Because violence isn't a glorious thing at all. Thats why I also beieve that that the teenagers of the USA would benifit greatly from seeing this movie. Too many of the movies in America glorify violence, death, and guns. But I am a bit timid about it being released in the US too. I worry that some kid who is immpretionable would get the wrong message and think that killing is cool, lords knows the US has enough trouble with those kind of people. Yet so does Japan and it went over very well over there, so I am optomistic about a US audiance understanding this movie. The very end of the movie when the credits roll really pulled at my insides. The background for the credits is a class photo of Class B. The camera goes over each section of the pic so that you may get a close up of each student. You are reminded that when you see their faces that these are kids. They had lives, families, friends, goals, dreams, and most painful of all students who were in love with them, sadly alot of them never found out until it was too late. In the special version we see flashbacks of their childhoods. We see them struggling against not fitting in, domestic violence, and suicides in the family. And we see thatnone of these kids are bad kids, they are all alone and crying out for love. That is probably the greatist tragedy of all.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Lucas will never give us the originals again because we let his precious Laserdisk investment flop. Any dvd he gives us will just be a grab for more money and to instill more animosity to the fans of the originals. The new versions suck and will continue to do so.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Lynch's favorite approach seems to be to throw together whatever weirdness happens to leap out of his subconscious and leave it to reviewers and viewers to attach some sort of deeper meaning to all the nonsense.  Sorry, I'm not interested in playing that game.  Yes I suppose there might be a semi coherant plot somewhere in there between all the onresolved subplots, abandoned characters, hallucinations, and dream sequences, but I was just too bored to care enough to sort it all out.  I was not impressed by all the symbolism or the baffling way the story unfolds. This was pretentious garbage, though stylishly done.  After reading the reviews raving about this movie, I'm even more sure of that.  I really couldn't care less about how the cowboy represented Diane's conscience, the tiny old people \\"spectors of her lost innocence\\", etc etc.  I have to laugh when I read how profound some people think this nonsense is. Yeah, I get it, its a dream for the most part.  So what?
0517543052|5.0|Truly a spiritual cookbook that is never outdated. This remarkable book is not only a wonderful inspirational story of Richard Alpert AKA. Baba Ram Dass, but the sketches, in the book, bring the words to life. After having purchased \\"Be Here Now\\" in the 70's, fully making use of its recipes I also used the pages for something a bit more aesthetic-- admittedly using the pages to wallpaper my bathroom!    Needless to say I have purchased more than one copy of this unique and charming book. Anyone who has or is going on a spiritual quest this is a must read. A book you will be happy that you met and to hang out with...    ~From the original review written July 25, 1997    If you like or love this book I also would highly recommend that you see the movie \\"FIERCE GRACE\\". the biography of Ram Dass. \\"FIERCE GRACE\\" was named by NEWSWEEK as one of the Top Five Non-Fiction Films of 2002.
B00008G9JN|4.0|This unique sound is very enjoyable. Ian Anderson and the band will never be copied, because they are totally original.  Very creative melodies, the heartbeat of life.
B00008DDSC|5.0|When I first saw this movie with a few girl friends, they were all a little weirded out to say the least. Yet I found myself longing so much to have a lover like Mr. Grey. I can't quite explain it but I found myself quite aroused by the spanking scences, and looking forward with great anticipation for the next time Mr. Grey brought out his red pen!! I really liked this movie because it doesn't try and cure Lee of her love of pain, but rather it show that it can be a natural and an erotic part of life. So to all the people out their who are into S&M don't be ashamed of it, enjoy it all that you can, and believe me im sure there are others out their who share your love of pain/pleasure too!!
630024797X|5.0|Sort of the antithesis of the type of movie ERASERHEAD is, this human drama near-epic is peaceful and down-to-earth, not to mention the only good movie Wenders has ever made. Harry Dean Stanton delivers one of the greatest performances ever captured on screen as a man desperately trying to run from and forget the past. After disappearing for years, he is found near-dead in a desert bar. A phone number in his pocket leads doctors to his brother, played by Dean Stockwell, who flies out to Texas from Los Angeles to pick him up. We spend the next two hours gradually finding out exactly what has happened. Stanton's confrontation with Natassja Kinksi is amazingly heart-wrenching. Quite possibly the most beautiful film in motion picture history.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|With the music industry the way it is, people are often more concerned about the artist's appearance than the actual music they produce. I always despised Avril Lavigne's \\"punk\\" or \\"bad ass\\" public persona. But I try not to let the image of the artist sway me in any way, because it should be about the music first and foremost, not what image they portray. So I gave her first CD a chance.  The funny thing was, her first CD \\"Let Go\\" couldn't have been further away from the punk image she was trying to project. In fact, it mostly was calm, light hearted pop, and although it was catchy, it lacked any sort of depth or soul.  Ironic product of the \\"punk princess\\" who was so anti-pop....   <br /> <br /> However, Avril's new CD \\"Under my Skin\\" demonstrated her growth and maturity as both a musician and a person. Firstly, she has calmed her rough persona down quite a bit. She is no longer sticking up her middle finger and sticking out her tongue at every camera she passes by. So she is no longer trying to be something she isn't. Great. But what really matters is... how is the music?  Well,  I give the girl props for writing her own stuff. In this era of studio produced pop, it's a nice breath of fresh air. The album definitely has a more rock sound to it. The sound is defiantly less pop-ish and you can tell she is starting come into her own. Her very unique voice is showcased very well throughout the album, which allows the listeners to see how talented she truly is. Her lyrics are significantly more real than on her previous album, which is a big step up. They definitely reflect the trials of a growing young woman, and deal with some big issues. Her single \\"Don't tell me\\", for example, deals with the pressures of sex, and standing up for what you believe in. Kudos to her for the positive message of abstinence in that song too!  Songs like \\"Slipped Away\\", and \\"Take me Away\\" just have a real soul and honesty about them, that she lacked before. One of the deepest and most soulful songs on the CD is definitely \\"Nobody's Home\\" which I am completely convinced must be autobiographical... but who knows? <br /> <br /> So, I was very pleasantly surprised to hear this album, and while there are still some remnants of her light, almost bubble gum pop past, the CD was overall had a wonderful sound and demonstrated a maturing Avril. I think as she grows into early adulthood, she will mature into an extremely talented musician, and I'm interested to watch to see what is in store for her.  <br />
038551123X|4.0|By day, Dexter Morgan works as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department. By night, he obeys the needs of his \\"Dark Passenger\\" and performs unspeakable acts of murder. What separates Dexter from the ordinary sociopath is that he only dispatches bad guys who have committed horrendous crimes of their own. When he was young, a traumatic event that he cannot recall turned him from a human into an emotionless monster whose only passion is for murder. At the advice of his foster father, a policeman who realized that Dexter had a very dark side, Dexter learned to channel his murderous urges by converting bad deeds to good and eliminating sociopaths.  He appears outwardly normal, but performs his grisly acts in a cautious, well-planned, and neat fashion so that he will not be unmasked.<br /><br />When his foster sister, a Miami policewoman, becomes involved in investigating a series of serial murders that are as bizarre and ritualistic as his own acts, Dexter helps her seek out the perpetrator. Because Dexter and his target seem to think in a similar way, Dexter can predict how he will strike next. He has disturbingly realistic dreams that further lead him on the trail of the killer. But soon, it appears that the killer has found out about Dexter and is sending him gruesome messages. How could anyone know Dexter's secrets?  Or are these acts ones that Dexter's Dark Passenger is suddenly performing on its own?<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone. Written in a first-person narrative, Dexter's thoughts and actions might disturb some readers. On the one hand he is depicted as having a charming and attractive facade that can be intentionally endearing rather than frightening. On the other, he is a cold-blooded killer with no human sentiment. Dexter deftly sums himself up as \\"Quirky, funny, happy-go-lucky, dead-inside Dexter.\\"  I was fascinated by this peek into Dexter's inner life, and I found his personality as refreshingly unique and contradictory as that of Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />It is the ending of the story that has knocked its rating down from five to four stars. It was far-fetched and a bit corny. But I will forgive debut author Jeff Lindsay this shortcoming since he did an admirable job of portraying a freshly original protagonist with an interesting character flaw. I could imagine future novels starring Dexter, and if there are, I will certainly read the next one.<br /><br />Eileen Riebackhat of Hannibal Lecter. <br /> <br />It is the ending of the story that has knocked its rating down from five to four stars.

B000003TA9|5.0|Amazing!  It was well ahead of it's time and still remains as dynamic as anything of its caliber today.
0440539811|5.0|This book is very clever. The authors have a well-developed sense of humor, going so far even as to poke fun at themselves throughout the book. <br /> <br />I agree with one of the earlier review that really what this book is trying to say is that an open mind is key to understanding the world. <br /> <br />Reading this book as if it actually will provide REAL answers to to the \\"real\\" world is not a good idea. Conspiracy theories aside, if you trace where some of these facts come from, you can tell that they have been stretched a little here and there to fit the story (though sometimes not by much...). <br /> <br />Bottom line, this book is great and I think any disillusioned liberal should read it. It'll provide a good laugh and maybe even a dose of hope. <br /> <br />And the author of this review will NOT die for Fernando Poo!
0780021150|5.0|This film left me numb. The final scenes hit me with a power I had never before experienced. Peter Lorre plays a child murderer (immaculately, I must add) being pursued, throughout the course of the film, by not only the police, but the underground crime syndicate as well. Lang's use of the newfound sound technology is absolutely brilliant, as is his visual style. The opening scene shows shots of empty alleys, stairwells, and a lost balloon stuck in power lines over the sound of a mother calling for her child, instead of showing the actual killing itself. And its worth seeing for that alone.
6304806418|4.0|I am not a big Madonna fan, and I also saw the show twice on Broadway.  Yet the movie seemed to capture the essential story of a girl/woman who knew what she wanted, and went for it.  The acting by Madonna was very convincing, and who know that Antonio  Banderas could sing so well?  Worth taking a look at.
B0002858YS|5.0|OmG can a band get any better? They are like the most amazing band that has come to existance and i URGE everyone to buy this CD pRONTO!
B000002A3T|4.0|all in all a good cd. Definately not there best but still better then most bands greatest hits. the album starts off slowly but builds up steam. it seems the best tracks where placed at the end. My personal favorites where Keep Talking and the climactic High Hopes. If you are a Floyd fan you will like this cd. if u are not chances are you wont.
B0001CLGFK|5.0|I have never had any doubts about this being my favorite film. In fact, I somehow knew it was my favorite film before I'd even seen it. I had a hell of a time tracking a copy down in the post-moratorium, pre-eBay days (of Lexington, KY no less), but I had already bought a t-shirt and a poster. I can't explain it. When I finally saw the movie, I was unable to move. My mind has never been blown in such a way. And to make such a bizarre, otherwordly, and nearly plotless film that pulses with terror and emotion is absolutely brilliant. I don't know how David Lynch did it, but I'm glad he did. This film has seriously changed my life.
B00009W0WM|5.0|It would be pointless for me to try and say anything new about Casablanca, one of the best and most talked about films ever made. What I will say is that anyone who loves this movie should rush to buy this beautifully restored version. If you've only ever seen Casablanca on TV or a video version made from a less than perfect print, then this will be a revelation - it's like seeing it the way it was in the theatres back in 1943. The sharpness of the images, the interplay of light and shadow, the radiance of the visuals, the clarity of the sound - it's all breathtaking. This is glorious black and white at its best. And if that isn't enough, there is a second disc of intriguing extras. The cartoon version is my favorite, especially Tweetie Bird doing Peter Lorre. A true classic treated the way it deserves. Play it!
B00003CXAA|5.0|There really isn't a review that I can give to describe how great this motion picture trilogy is to me and probably everyone else who has seen it. Just buy it and you'll see what I mean. I promise you that you won't be disappointed    However, the DVD is reviewable. This is a DVD Collector's dream. The wealth of bonus material (documentaries, deleted scenes, story boards) is overwhelming. You will have to spend hours and hours just to see all of the features once. The real gem of these discs are the feature director's commentary that director Francis Ford Coppola gives for all three films. He will tell you everything you need to know about each scene as you watch.    The picture quality is pretty good. A little bit of grain and artifacts but you won't notice the film will engross you. It was put into 1.85:1 format ratio for the DVD which gives you more to see (left to right). You'll have to sacrifice some of the top and bottom of the usual prints but it's worth it. The new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack for each film is good as well. It's not earth shattering, but it'll get the job done.    This is the Ultimate Godfather edition that anyone can ask for. You can't call yourself a true Godfather fan until you've taken a look at these discs. Thanks Paramount!!!!!! Buy it now!!!

B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys has such an original and striking sound. Though her music certainly can be classified as stemming from R&B and soul, there is something about Keys that is so sophisticated, elegant, and mature beyond her years that I'm a fan of her hers even though I don't naturally gravitate towards these genres. My favorite songs on \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" are <br /> <br />\\"You Don't Know My Name\\": vibrant and soaring; Keys' vocals are pretty magnificent on this one. When she calls her crush at the end of the song, you can't help but smile. <br /> <br />\\"If I Ain't Got You\\": such a unique sound; first heard this one on the radio, and have liked it ever since. <br /> <br />\\"Diary\\": I love the piano and the way the entire thing comes together for this one. Heartfelt and moving. <br /> <br />All of the songs on the album seem deeply personal and in one way or another comment on love and all the good and bad that comes with that. I would highly recommend buying this cd.
6304712944|2.0|One of my fondest childhood memories is being taken to the Majestic Theatre in New York to see Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in Camelot. It was a magical experience and one of the reasons why I have a lifelong love of musicals. Naturally, I could not wait for Camelot to be filmed. When it was, way back in 1967, I was extremely disappointed. Seeing it again - or, rather, trying to sit through it - has not changed that opinion.<br /><br />All the ingredients were there for a classic musical: an enchanted setting, familiar characters, a brilliant score, a script with flashes of wit. So what if the choreography was minimal? Instead we got a musical with plot and characters, comedy and drama. At least, we got that when it was on the stage.<br /><br />Where did the film go wrong? The casting nearly doomed it - a musical populated with non-singers. Of course, that in itself is not always a problem (see West Side Story) but here the actors try to sing for themselves. King Arthur's songs were written to be what Alan Jay Lerner described as \\"talk-sung\\" and worked as well for Richard Burton as the method had for Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady. But Richard Harris had delusions of vocal grandeur and destroyed every song he touched. And Vanessa Redgrave...not to mention Franco Nero...? Still, the film might have survived the casting if it had a better director. Joshua Logan was really a stage director and had little feel for cinema (see South Pacific if you doubt that). Camelot's direction is that it had no direction. Example: At the end of the film, during what should have been a brilliantly dramatic and unforgettable moment, the camera zooms IN on Richard Harris, almost going up his nostrils, instead of pulling back to reveal the entire scene.<br /><br />Visually, some of the film is quite impressive. But three hours is a long time to look at just costumes and scenery. And some bits are just laughable - such as spreading the word about Camelot throughout the land with flyers. (a) They didn't have printing presses then because (b) hardly anyone could read. But that's the sort of film it is - you need to suspend your belief along with your expectations.<br /><br />There are many good and even great musicals available on DVD. Buy any or all of them instead of Camelot.yers. (a) They didn't have printing presses then because (b) hardly anyone could read.

B00005JMAH|5.0|i love this movie so much! I love Daniel Radcliffe and the rest of the cast. It is such an exciting movie! I admit there are a lot of scenes that were cut off but it turned out to be a very good movie. Dont compare the three movies because dont forget their different directors, the cast is growing up and each is a different plot. anyway watch the movie it's a lot of fun and it is exciting! If you're not a BIG HP fan..gurls just watch it for DAN...cuz he looks amazing and very HOT. GRRRRRR
0783114222|5.0|This was a miniseries made for HBO, covering the history of the Apollo Program.  The stories show the development of the Apollo, the problems that had to be resolved, the disasters and triumphs along the way and the people who made it happen. <br /> <br />Each story has a different focus, so as you go through the history of the program you get to see it from a lot of different perspectives.  One story shows what the astronaut's wives went through, another shows the training the astronauts had to go through in geology so that they would be able to pick the best rocks to bring back for study.   <br /> <br />One episode shows a veteran space reporter and his battles to cover the Apollo 13 story without bothering the families of the astronauts who were in danger, while his young competitor did whatever it took to get the story. <br /> <br />If you have any interest in the space program and moon landings you'll love this series.  If you don't know anything about NASA, watch this series and you'll probably want to learn more about it.

0156027321|5.0|This novel is beautifully written and exquisitely detailed, though often the details are gruesome (this book is not for the faint of heart!)  It is so creative and even though you know from the start that Pi lives to tell the tale, the book is full of surprises (though I discourage people from reading the book summaries - they disclose too much, although nothing can adequately prepare you for the end of this book).  Some readers have commented that they struggled with the beginning but I would suggest that it is well worth your persistence.   I finished this book last night and literally was so disturbed and confused that I had trouble falling asleep.  This novel is positively brilliant, and I look forward to reading more of the author's work.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Can even *one* of you out of the 100 or so \\"Blah blah, lies, blah blah\\" reviews here refute some of the major points, or answer some of the major questions from the movie?  In this vast internet, there is NOT ONE SITE that contains evidence disproving corporate ties to the White House with Iraq, the Saudi's questionable ties to Bush, and on and on...<br /><br />I am open to contrary evidence to this movie, but I have yet to see a single shred.  Present it, or save your empty reviews for a less important movie.

B0001V07ZQ|5.0|If you loved reading Horatio Hornblower, you'll love this movie. This movie brings to life the 18th century Navy: the long drawn out sea chases punctuated with a few minutes of heart pounding battle.  Those were the days when men were men and operated on themselves without anesthesia.  Those were the days of exploration and discovery: rounding the horn and anchoring at the Galapagos.  Those were the days when, lacking the pacifier of TV, men learned to play instruments and thought deeply about how the world worked. <br /> <br />The acting is fantastic with characters you get to know and love:  the captain, the doctor, the brave sons of nobility learning the art of leadership and command.  The scenery, though consisting mostly of a single ship and the sea and the sky, is wonderful.  And there is plenty of action to hold the attention of even a restless 9 year old.  (Well, okay, I just grilled him and he liked The Last Samurai \\"way better\\".)
0060977493|5.0|It is seven years since The God of Small Things was published to rave reviews. It heralded the emergence of a very bright star, a great writer and lyricist, on the literary firmament. And it won the Booker Prize in 1997. Most deservedly so. It is still on the Penguin Books, India, best setter list in the number three place, even after all these years, right next to their most recently published best sellers.The paperback copies are still selling here in the USA. That happens very rarely because most best sellers die a slow death in two to three years, and unsold copies begin to gather dust on bookshelfs. More than two hundred synopses  of the novel have been written, and so I won't be writing one more. There is no need. What I wish to do, however, is to bring to the attention of the readers and lovers of good literature a few of the lyrical gems that have gushed from Arundhati's pen.<br /><br />\\"Baby Kochamma was holding on to the back of the front seat with her arms. When the car moved, her arm fat swung like heavy washing in the wind. Now it hung down like a fleshy curtain, blocking Estha from Rahel.\\"  \\"A pale moon hung hugely in the sky and went where they went. As big as the belly of a beer-drinking man.\\" She describes clouds in the sky : \\"A Transparent spotted snake with a forked tongue floated across the sky. Then a transparent Roman soldier on a spotted horse.\\"  \\"The gray sky curdled and the clouds resolved themselves into little lumps, like substandard mattress stuffing.\\" These are the things I saw in the sky myself when I was growing up.The book is sprinkled throughout with original, brilliant, startling and perfect metaphors and similes, at regular and frequent intervals. Sometimes half a dozen or more at a stretch. Sometimes just a few. Marvelous. A stunning debut. Read it. And find your mind floating away to a distant,wondrous, startling, mesmerizing world. The world of Arundhati.
B000083LQB|5.0|This release is really great.  Sort of irks me that the original release (that I owned) is such a bad mix compared.  But unlike many other re-release remixes, this one gives you more than 1-cd worth of bonus tracks (some of the extra tracks are on disk 1).  Anyway, I checked it out from the public library and figured I'd just listen to the extras.  But the remixes of the old songs are really compelling.  It's almost like the original is FM radio and this one is CD. Whatever.  I don't know if you \\"aint alternative if you don't own this album\\" but I can definitely say it's the best release I've heard in several years--and it's an \\"oldie\\".
B000003TA4|2.0|I can't beleive people still rant and rave about this thing being the ultimate in modern rock. Get over it folks, it's mediocre at best.

They also opened the floodgates for a whole stack of crummy mid 90s bands who have been thankfully long forgotten.
6305842442|3.0|People new to Blade Runner will probably not like this movie as much as the original with the narration (not available anymore, as far as I know). While Harrison Ford's narration has its weaknesses, it clarifies the story and keeps the viewer \\"tuned in.\\" Without it, I think the movie gets a bit confusing without repeated viewing and without the knowledge the original narration communicated. <br /> <br />I believe the editorial review to be incorrect.  At the time of the Director's Cut release, Ridley Scott acknowledged that the original release of the movie had his approval and that he had added the narration because he felt moviegoers would not understand the movie very well.  I don't believe this is a case where the studio executives \\"stole\\" the picture from the director and forced their own changes. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|At the first listen I was hooked. They play very catchy songs. They remind me of the hives but they have their own sound. I absolutely love every song on this album!! They are very poppy but in an edgy vein. I have never seen them live but I am sure they would be a fun band to see. This is a band you can shake your hips to and I for one think that is a good thing!! Definitely check them out if you like to dance.
B00000ADG2|5.0|The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is one of the greatest albulms ever made.  She practically touched on every part of human emotion. My favorite song is the one \\"to Zion\\" a beautiful song about Lauryn choosing her child over the lifestyles of fame, having her baby ignoring what people thought.  The choir coming in and giving her back-up was excellent it was just beautiful, spiritual if you will.  I also like \\"doo woop (that thing)\\" her first single off the album a nice upbeat song with the drums, horns, Lauryn's beautiful voice, that was perfect too. Another one of my favorite songs was \\"Nothing Even Matters\\" her duet with D'Angelo very pretty and soulful, one of my favorite songs period.  I could go on and on about every track but then I'd ruin the experience for you.  Go out and buy it it's an excellent work of art.
B00002E285|1.0|I like some of Pink Floyd's music and heard so many songs from the album that I finally decided to purchase and watch the video.  Roger Waters was wise in sticking to music and not going into the movie making business. <br />   This is a bizarre and completely incoherent saga of a self-absorbed rock star tortured by his past and going insane with his present situation.  You have to figure out for yourself what the plot is about, so bear with me while I attempt to interpret this thing. <br />  The main character, \\"Pink Floyd's\\" father was killed on a battlefield and he grows up with an over protective mother who tries to shield him from pain by starting to build a wall which Floyd adds to later on in life.  He attends a strict institutional school where a rigid schoolmaster ridicules his poetry in front of the class.  Later, as an adult, his wife, who he completely ignores, has an affair.  Floyd calls her when she is in bed with another guy and she hangs up on him, thus, another \\"brick in the wall\\". <br />  Throughout the movie, Floyd obsesses over these things and exaggerates them in his mind.  The school he attended becomes a factory where kids are transformed into faceless creatures and fed into a meat grinder.  An erotic cartoon plays in his head where two flowers are copulating and the female flower devours the male flower and turns into a monster. <br />  Floyd's present condition, a pampered, over-indulged rock star with screaming, demanding fans, groupies that throw themselves at him, and producers and promoters that leach off him drives him to insanity.  The wall which he has built to shut everything out becomes his biggest nightmare.  <br /> In a fit of rage, he trashes his hotel suite and terrifies a young groupie then passes out from either an overdose or a mental breakdown.  His producers and promoters give him injections to revive him for the show which transform him into a psychopathic Hitler-type character with an army of skinheads for fans who tryto take over the country.  Thus we have cartoons of mass destruction and goose-stepping hammers. <br />  Finally, Floyd, after bouncing back and forth from past to present and reality to fantasy, becomes a faceless naked creature trapped inside his wall with beastly cartoon characters trying to break in.  The wall blows up and the movie ends with children picking up the scraps. <br />  There are alot of tired, old anti-establishment themes from the late 60's throughout the movie but nobody has a real solution for anything.  It's also hard to identify with a narcissistic, self-absorbed prima dona who drives himself nuts. <br />In one scene, Floyd, as an adult, is curled up on his bed in a fetal position while asking his mother (in his mind) if \\"They're going to drop the bomb\\" or if she thinks his girlfriend/wife is  going to \\"tear her little boy apart\\". <br />  I often felt like reaching into the screen to slap this guy and tell him to get over it. <br />  It's hard to say if Bob Geldof, who plays \\"Pink\\" Floyd, is a good actor because he hardly says anything.  Most of the time his character is staring into space or into a TV screen trying to blot everything out. <br />  The best part of the movie is the imaginitive but weird animation.  This film displays the hedonistic narcissism of pop-rock culture.  It is very confusing and somewhat nauseating.
B000002WYT|2.0|Would like to say first to reviewer \\"Jim(Del Monte)\\" that Pres. G W Bush has done a great work to revitalize and help grow economics in his great country, secure borders and begin to \\"trim\\" those terrorists (a point the disastrous Carter and Clinton administrations should not be proud of). I don't trust Kerry either. <br />Concerning the album i've been rather deceived by the performance on Crash: The Matthews can do better. Perhaps theyve become too commercially blank;their political bias doesnt strenghten their art. They could be forgiven for supporting JK, but not for making a cd such as this one. For good RnR you ought to look elsewhere. Dave Matthews which i recommend, though: Live at The Luther or Live at Red Rocks.
B00012FXB8|3.0|This film is getting a decent rating for three reasons:The christain prisoners,the CGI for the dog-alien(despite how stupid the idea was),and of course,Sigourney Weaver third outing as Ripley.Besides those things mentioned,there isn't alot to like in this film.The story is too dark and depressing,the prison planet was a dumb idea,and don't even get me started on the stupid dog alien.Overall,the worst film in the ENTIRE series,but it's got some good moments.If you like Alien and Aliens,you may like Alien3.    (based on the theatrical version only)
B000244FDW|5.0|History first: this 1980 version was shown in 5 one-hour segments on Masterpiece Theatre in late 1980, with Alistair Cooke's comments each week.  The 1985 VHS release cut nearly 40 minutes (to fit on two tapes?) with the infamous 226 minute running time (3 hrs 46 min).  This DVD release has (yes, finally!) brought the full 5-part story back, with a running time of 265 (4 hrs 25 min), just as it was aired on PBS (although Alistair is absent from the DVD, which is why it isn't a full 5 hrs).  <br />Review: I happen to side with those who prefer this version to the 1995 A&E. I expect a good many Austen fans have never seen the full 1980 version, and being priced so reasonably, it is an easy yet heartfelt recommendation to make.  Enjoy! <br />
B00012FXAE|5.0|(My review is again based on the theatrical version) <br /> <br />That tagline was a understatement in this second film in the Alien Ouadrilogy.Most people call this the best film in the series and that is so true.This film has better acting(with amazing performances from Carrie Henn,Michael Bein,Bill Paxton,and a Oscar nominated performance by Sigourney Weaver),the action scenes are better,and the aliens look alot better.Overall,a better film than it's predecessor!!!!Recommened!!!!!
B00008EY65|3.0|When I was younger I used to read comic books very frequently, but as I've grown up my interest in them has failed. It got to the point that I am only vaguely familiar with any modern day comics. I was NOT familiar with Hellboy prior to my viewing it. However, a friend asked me to go see it and being that I work in a Cineplex I was able to see it free of charge (which may have helped to secure my enjoyment).<br /><br />I found that Hellboy was an extremely entertaining film, not just as a comic book movie. The various characters in the film were all interesting, in particular our hero. I wouldn't call this a great film, because I felt like there was something missing at the end of the movie. I did however enjoy it immensely, enough so that I've purchased this edition of the film.<br /><br />My only disappointment came as I found out from my manager that there is a 3 disc directors cut coming out within the next few months. Keep that in mind when purchasing. That's the reason for the 3 Star Rating. The film itself was very enjoyable, worth of a four star rating in my opinion; However the fact that another edition will be available shortly detracts from its worth.
B000244EMO|5.0|This is a awesome film that introduced the Predator,a alien hunter with the most advanced technology,into the world of cinema forever.The acting is great,the action is amazing,and the Predator is one of the greatest movie villians of all time.If you like Schwarzenegger movies or action movies,this is the film for you!Recommended!!!!!!
B00000DHRX|5.0|there are a lot of words that could explain the talent of this man.  not only is his music wonderful, but if you can understand what he says in his songs and relate it to your life in general, you'll notice how talented he is.  if i had to pick a favorite it would be the song older.  but there are so many more that i could pick also.  thank you for sharing your talent mr. michael.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Could this movie be get any better!, this is fantasy made come true, Labyrinth has always been a favorite of mine since I was a kid, rediscovering it, was a pleasure.  An amazing cast Bowie and Conelly.  And obviously the enigmatic puppet characters created by the only Jim Henson.  The storyline, the cinematography & the acting is superb.  The story about a teenage girl who has to find his baby brother who has been kidnap by a Wizard inside an enigmatic kingdom of gas lakes, crazy gadgets, and mad puppets.  She's running out of time an she has to end this labyrinth.  This movies takes you to a different world and the portrait of this story in cinema is so well done you end up believing that somehow, this place exist.  A movie that it's underrated and should become a classic at your own home theater.  ***** FIVE STARS!
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd is definitely the best Slipknot CD. I have all four of their cds (including Mate. Feed. Kill. Reapeat.) and I must recommend all of them to you. This self-titled one is by far the best though. Eyeless, Diluted, Surfacing, (sic), Wait and Bleed, Only One, and Liberate are my favorites and I could listen to them all day. If you like Slipknot, you should try out Korn, and System of a Down.
B0000042GM|5.0|This recording is definitive. Brahms is known to be passionate, loud, and temperamental like Beethoven. Thus, the piano playing required would have to be as such. Katchen makes full use of the range of the piano, never subduing any bass note, but rather, amplifies it. Furthermore, you don't get the over-romanticized and muddy texture of Evgeny Kissin. It is crisp, powerful, direct, and highly artistic. Truly passionate and other-worldly. But loud passion is not the only thing here; my opinion of Brahms is that his orchestral works are his best, that is, the symphonies and concertos. Yet, his intermezzi are perhaps one of the best compositions for the piano, and Katchen plays with the most careful detail to each and every nuance and phrasing for these gentle, often tragic pieces. Definetly recommended.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|If you loved their last two releases, \\"By The Way\\" and \\"Californiacation\\", you will love this CD.  This has all the ingredients of a great live album - good set list, great cover songs (\\"Brandy\\"), and new, unreleased songs (\\"Leverage of Space\\" and \\"Rolling Sly Stone\\").  The highlights of the album include their extended versions of \\"By The Way\\" and the finale of \\"Give It Away\\".   <br /> <br />The only downfall is that there are only 2 pre-Californiacation tracks.  I really wish John would learn to play some of the \\"One Hot Minute\\" songs. Since he was not with the band during the album, he refuses to play any of these songs.  I would love to hear \\"My Friends\\" or \\"Aeroplane\\" again.  But, I respect and understand their reasoning to focus on the newer material.  RHCP is a great band and I am happy that they are still around.   <br />
B000007ODY|2.0|Wow. I had so much respect for Karajan before these recordings; I still do, but not as much. While before I viewed Karajan as being almost immortal in any interpretation of any symphony, I now know otherwise. If you want a good recording of the first symphony, get the 1964 edition of the \\"Originals\\" by Deutsche Grammophon. Karajan conducts that version much better than this one, I mean he totally butchered the first symphony here. As for the 3rd, he also trips. His 3rd symphony is not as textured or multicolored as his other recordings of the 3rd. His 2nd and 4th, while having some merits, is for the most part, dry, muddy, and without the passionate flame and directness that Brahms has to be played with.
B000286S8S|5.0|I guess there are a lot of Motley Crue fans here or something, cause the number of 1 star reviews for this release is insaine!!! I've heard so many complaints that have no substantial grounds whatsoever it makes me wonder why Amazon has even allowed them to be published!!! Anyways, First I'm going to counter a few of the complaints before I get into this review:    &#34;VH already has Best of Vol 1. They should have done Best of Vol 2!!! This collection SUCKS!!!&#34;    How long have these people been listening to music??? Many times, especially in recent years as CD manufacturing costs have been going down, record companies release more complete compilations of artist's work. I don't see too many Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Who, etc. fans whining over something so trivial.    &#34;These are all old songs, and the new ones SUCK!!! Don't get this!!!&#34;  I never knew so many people had no idea what a &#34;greatest hits&#34; album was. For those people who have never purchased a CD in their life, allow me to explain. A greatest hits album (sometimes called a 'best-of') gets together all of the band's biggest hits and puts them all in one package so fans can listen to a band's best work minus the fillers. Now sometimes they'll put on a few new tracks just to get some interest, but ususally these songs are not very good, though there are exceptions. ANYONE here that is trying to review this as a 3 song package rather than a greatest hits album should be shot down because they are too stupid to live!!!    &#34;It's not in chronilogical order!!! Now it sucks!!!&#34;  There are just as many gratest hits albums that are not in chronilogical order as there are in chronilogical order. Always has, and always will be. I sometimes find it more enjoyavle when they are in random order, as it makes the album more exciting and freash to listen to as it mixes up all the band's eras into one listening experence. But for those you who MUST have it in chronilogical order, many sites including Amazon are listing the track listing in chronilogical order. For those of you who are too lazy to check the top of the page, here it is:    Disc 1.  1. Eruption      2. You Really Got Me    3. Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love    4. Jamie's Cryin'    5. Runnin' With The Devil    6. Beautiful Girls            7. Dance The Night Away            8. And The Cradle Will Rock...            9. Everybody Wants Some            10. Unchained            11. Dancing In The Street            12. (Oh) Pretty Woman            13. Hot For Teacher            14. Jump            15. Panama    16. I'll Wait            17. Why Can't This Be Love            18. Dreams            19. Best Of Both Worlds            20. Love Walks In              Disc: 2    1. When It's Love            2. Finish What You Started            3. Feels So Good            4. Black And Blue            5. Poundcake            6. Runaround            7. Right Now            8. Top Of The World            9. Can't Stop Loving You            10. Not Enough            11. It's About Time            12. Learning To See            13. Up For Breakfast            14. Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love (Live)            15. Jump (Live)            16. Panama (Live)              &#34;Sammy is on it!!! SUCKAGE!!!&#34;  I will admit DLR &#62; SH, but Sammy wasn't ALL that bad. And whether you like to admit it or not, the band did release a number of hits with Sammy. But for those of you who MUST NOT listen to Haggar, check the list above. You can see that even with Sammy, this is still a very fine collection of DLR songs despite missing a few fan favs.    Overall this is the best VH compliation EVER!!! Both Dave and Sammy eras covered beautifully to make this pretty much a definitive collection. Sure there are a few crybabies out there that are upset that Van Halen didn't consolte them directly so this release would be EXACTLY the way they wanted it, but I have two words for these rejects: CD BURNER. I suggest they invest in one if they don't like how Eddie put together this album.
038572179X|5.0|The first 175 pages of Atonement are spare and stunning: an unsentimental portrayal of pre-world war II society girded by class and caste with all its complexifying contradictions and spiked with sex, jealousy, betrayal and decadence. McEwan makes the house itself  a symbol of a world too complacent for its own survival. No explanation is needed - so don't read rest of novel. Be satisfied with a perfect novella.
B0000024K1|5.0|Chuck D, Flavor Flav and Terminator X tore through barriers with \\"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\\". Influence stemming from Run-D.M.C.'s rock/rap formula, throwing in jazz, funk and an unbelievable amount of samples. Since it was 1988, there were no restrictions on sampling. Therefore, the album is full of familiar tidbits and snippets of great records, from bands like The Beastie Boys, Steve Miller Band and so much more. I also believe that they invented that high pitch horse squealing sample heard in most of the tracks on this album; that rap groups have continued to copy/use since. This album is one of the greatest hip-hop albums of the 1980s, expanding the limits of hip-hop and showing just how far it could be taken. This is Definitely and old school sensation.
B00000K3UU|4.0|This movie is definitely a new direction for Sandler.  If you're tired of the nonstop big-kid antics in Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, then you'll probably like this movie.  Sandler plays a thirty-something law-school graduate who is unemployed, but relies on an accident insurance settlement for his income.   <br />Until one day... <br />His roommate (Jon Stewart) has just left for China on a business trip, and his son by a one-night stand shows up on their doorstep.  Since Sandler's girlfriend has threatened to dump him if he didn't start to do something with his life, he decides to adopt little Julian (played by twin brothers) by claiming to be the guy who is really his roommate.  After taking care of the kid for several days, he inevitably becomes attached to him.  Just one problem: the Social Services Department finds out what he's up to, and tries to take Julian away.  It's a touching role that Sandler plays, as the guy who never grew up, but instantly gains 20 years in maturity when he tries to become a father.  With a great cast, including always-funny Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi among others, and a great music selection (nice to hear Styx in a modern movie, even Sheryl Crow covering \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\"), this movie will probably become a classic family movie, despite some harsh language here and there (just as much by the kid as the adults: you know how funny kids are when they repeat what the adults say without knowing what it means).  This movie is definitely one of Sandler's best ever.
0060931736|5.0|\\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" is not an easy book, though it seems to be at first. If you start reading it, you expect something in the \\"Dead Poets Society\\" vein: a teacher who inspires his/her pupils and makes them better human beings. <br /> <br />But in Miss Brodie's case, this is not so. In fact, Muriel Spark's novel is ultimately a very dark and depressing one, in spite of its seemingly lighthearted tone and loads of irony. It is about power, deception, loyalty, influence, sin, love and hate... <br /> <br />In fact, the novel adresses many dilemmas of human interaction, all inserted in a seemingly simple and straightforward story. There are no good and bad characters in the book, only good and bad acts and attitutes. But in the end no-one can remain unspoilt and pure. <br /> <br />One of the most fascinating books I've ever read.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Mr. Evans, first I will not say that I disagree with your unhappiness about losing the original theatrical versions of Episodes IV,V,VI.  I do cherish the tinted green effect when watching my rustic VHS copies.  I will, however, say that I do not agree with you when you make your statement that Lucas has no soul.<br /><br />Perhaps we're looking at this the wrong way.  Kids are growing up in a society that demands entertainment.  Video games are becoming more and more realistic while the other side of the entertainment industry fights to stay ontop of the \\"ooh & ahh\\" competition.  Lucas gave me something that you had and I didn't.  I had the chance to go to my local movie theater and watch the Trilogy.  I will say that tears welled up in my eyes when \\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . . \\" came up on the screen.  The anticipation of the theme that, like most young children when I was their age, use to hum and sing wile running around the front yard, pretending that I was defeating Darth Vador.  Lucas made it possible for me to feel like a child again when my parents first rented Star Wars, yet this time I was able to enjoy as they had the first time they saw it.<br /><br />As far as putting the Trilogy on DVD and them being updated yet again.  All I can ask is have you ever had a really good idea, put it into action and then thought that you could possibly make it better?  I have.  Perhaps Lucas has too.  Besides, keeping the DVD updated with special effects just might attract newer, younger Star Wars fans.  True, the real love of Star Wars isn't based on the special effects of the movie.  But please admit, when you first saw the death star blow I'm sure you found that amazing.  Think of how much that is going to be for this new generation watching for the first time.  I'm still wowed.  Of course I'm still easily entertained.<br /><br />The fact that Lucas makes these movies available for every generation is awesome.  I know that when the time comes, I will share my love of Star Wars with my family.  I have Mr. Lucas to thank for that.  Hopefully some day when I'm long gone, my family will cherish that same love and share it with their family.  Perhaps it's not about money, but more of love.  Love of entertainment.  Love of science fiction.  Love of heroism.  Whatever you want to attach it to, it's still love.  Lucas' love.<br /><br />I'm not trying to pick a fight with you.  I'm not going to be one of the gentleman who sits in the basement of their parents house and fights with everyone on everything by putting their posts on the internet.  Not just me.  Just wanted it so we could see both sides of the coin.es, I will share my love of Star Wars with my family.  I have Mr. Lucas to thank for that.

B000000W5L|2.0|Why, exactly, is \\"Exile On Main Street\\" supposed to be so great? I read other reviews of this sprawling mess and saw words like \\"nasty\\", \\"edgy\\", and \\"funky\\" routinely used to describe it...but seriously, folks, where on this album do you hear ANYTHING nasty or edgy? The Stones played much better blues and country on \\"Beggars Banquet\\", and they rocked far more convincingly on \\"Let It Bleed\\". Their music had lost its bite by this point(it was briefly resurrected on the 1983 single 'Undercover of the Night'), and these songs make them sound like Brian Jones's worst nightmare: a very white band doing a tired, almost Vegas-esque parody of roots music.  <br /> 'Shine a Light' epitomizes how far out of touch with their roots the Stones actually were in 1972; it's a dreary, maudlin, cliche-ridden attempt at an anthem that falls flat on its face('Salt of the Earth' on \\"Beggars Banquet\\", while also dripping with insincerity, is a better song in this vein). 'Rocks Off' and 'Happy' are good, breezy songs, and 'Tumbling Dice' is okay. I can live without the remainder of \\"Exile\\", however, and the argument that it would have been stronger as a stripped-down, single-disc release is really meaningless--it still would be disappointingly flaccid when compared to the Stones' earlier work. Where is this album's 'Street Fighting Man' or 'Gimme Shelter' or 'Brown Sugar'? Nowhere. The fire is gone. <br />Buy \\"Exile\\" if you must, but remember that it's only been considered the \\"best Stones album\\" since the mid-nineties or so, just as the generally unremarkable \\"Revolver\\" is now touted by critics as the finest thing the Beatles ever created. It is inadvisable to buy into the critical mythology of rock music; listen to the records and decide for yourself.   <br />  <br />       <br />
B00000DFTG|4.0|I LOVE IT! I saw the concert for this CD back in Jan.1999, I WAS a 90% Ozzy Osbourne fan before that,(I'm too young to remember more than 2 Black Sabbath radio songs) but hearing and seeing Ozzys previous band LIVE in concert, with HIM singing of course was excellent!!! When I listen to this CD, I feel the excitement of the concert! It will put you into such a great mood!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!  Side 2 of mine got \\"Borrowed\\", which stinks big time!!! But thats ok...... I never gave him his Black Sabbath Reunion tour t-shirt yet either!!! HaHaHa!!!  <br /> Rock On people!!!! Black Sabbath & Ozzy RULE!!!
B00007G1ZM|4.0|There is something surreal about Ms Crawford's life and career and the way they intertwine to make a fascinating but entertaining study. MILDRED PIERCE the film seems to be a vehicle that Ms Crawford was born to play so uncannily does it seem to mirror her broader experiences ; with success from impoverishment to wealth; with men - the good man figure, the lazy aristocrat spoiled sponger male figure, the businessman hustler figure; with children - her relationship with her daughter which turned sour.  Whatever the motivations, Ms Crawford and her character are driven, unhappy creatures, searching but seemingly unable to find love they so achingly desire.  Melodrama?  Perhaps, but a terrific melodrama.  An excellent and revealing but ultimately sympathetic  documentary narrated by Angelica Huston, is included and complements this fine film.
B000003KCU|4.0|Fans of movies like \\"Galaxy Quest\\" will probably find this dated but still entertaining. If you enjoyed \\"Goonies\\" you should like this movie. Three teenage boys build a spaceship from plans that are sent to them by aliens. The fact they build it from a carnerval ride and other miscellaneous items only shows the imagination. A fun adventure for kids of all ages. The young aliens that sent the plans to the teenagers have modelled their behavior based on our TV shows. The alien comedy is like Robin Williams did in Aladdin, off the wall imitations of celebrities. I enjoyed it when I first saw it as someone in my twenties and I still think it is fun to watch.
0790732254|5.0|This is by far the ultimate for Burton/Taylor fans.<br /><br />The film is an adaptation of Edward Albee's play about a university couple whose relationship is so complex, upon first look, it appears they cannot bear each other.  But look closer - much closer.  While they seem to have a horrible way of helping each other survive (and believe me, that is what, at least HALF of this is about) they indeed do each other a service by punishing each other for whatever it is each of them feel guilty about.<br /><br />But this is a psychological thriller at its best.  The diaglogue is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing.  It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships.  It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialogue because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.<br /><br />The simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who \\"entertain\\" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party.  George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff.  While George and Martha are old hats at this \\"banter\\" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their pyschological tortue chanber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games. Even by today's standards, this is truly an intricate, disturbing, but thoroughly enjoyable look at what drives some relationships.<br /><br />Oscars went to the women but not the men! Hmmmmmmmmmmm.<br />An even more interesting bit of trivia is that Bette Davis wanted to play this part badly but eventually lost out to Liz.  One can only imagine what Martha would have been like in the hands of Bette Davis.  And as much as I love Bette, she would have to have been off the chain to match Taylor's ferocity.<br /><br />Classic fate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLT5|5.0|Better than Schindler's list. This is the story about survival against all odds, love of music in spite of hatred and friendships despite differences. Add to all that, this is a true story about someone who just recently (2002) passed away. <br /> <br />Wladyslaw Szpilman is possibly one of the best Pianists in Poland when Germany invades and disenfranchises the Jews. In a short period of time, Szpilman and his family lose everything; their money, their freedom and eventually their lives. Szpilman because of his genius on the piano is saved time and time again from what could almost be certain death. The story of his survival is amazing, one could say almost miraculous.  <br /> <br />There is also the music in this film, although this isn't your Amadeus (i.e. music throughout) it still has those moments when we see and hear Szpilman play Chopn, and it is in these moments when the suffering (both his on film and ours?) becomes almost bearable. What Amadeus did for me in sparking a love for Mozart, the pianist (unintentionally) did for Chopn.  <br /> <br />I cannot say much more as this movie has been adequately reviewed by 200+ other able reviewers, all I can say is that it needs to be in your collection, whether you love good music, have an interest in history or you want a movie about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. <br /> <br />One cannot recommend this movie enough - a definite must-see. <br />  <br /> <br />
B0000AFQS0|5.0|If you're a rock n' roll fan and want to know what the Who is all about, or if you are a Who fan and want a DVD of live and TV performances, this film is where you start.  I'm 37 years old, and I first saw this movie on cable when I was in the sixth grade---I instantly became a fan of the Who, and have been one ever since.      This film is essentially a montage of performance footage from the band's beginning to about 1978, interspliced with interview segments and some voice-overs.    It's not a documentary in the usual sense insofar as it doesn't attempt to track the personal histories of the band members or the band itself in a studied or chronological fashion.  Rather, it's more of an attempt to capture the raucous and explosive energy of the Who on film, and it totally succeeds in doing so.      Among its many excellent performance clips, it contains definitive and complete live performances of the \\"mini-opera\\" \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\", \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  It also includes the band's literally explosive (and infamous) performance on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the mid to late 60's, wacked appearances by Ringo Starr, and even a sketch comedy segment featuring Steve Martin with the late Keith Moon.  It's a total hodgepodge, and its all brilliant, all Who, in all their ragged glory.  If you buy only one Who DVD, or even only one rock n' roll DVD, this is it right here.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Jack Warner is said to have once told an underling not to bring him any movies about people who write with feather pens. The mogul believed that costume epics were dull and plodding, guaranteed to test the patience of most audiences.<br /><br />When Stanley Kubrick delivered his film \\"Barry Lyndon\\" to Warner Bros. in 1975, the studio's namesake was long gone, and that was probably for the best since he may have chosen not to release what is the ultimate feather pen movie and also Kubrick's greatest masterpiece. If asked to do the impossible and name the best film ever made, I wouldn't hesitate to give my vote to \\"Barry Lyndon.\\"<br /><br />Plodding? Yes. Dull? To those who demand rapid fire editing, it may be the dullest movie ever. For those who appreciate fine literature and fine art, \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is an absolute feast, visually, aurally, and dramatically. Based on an obscure novel by William Thackeray, it's the story of an Irish lad climbing the ranks of English society, alienating everyone in his path.<br /><br />As Redmond Barry, Ryan O' Neal's Irish brogue comes and goes, but despite that inconsistency, he acquits himself well. Also worth noting is Michael Hordern's narrator, often seeming to express disapproval for the main character as he perceptively surveys his exploits.<br /><br />The real star of the film is Kubrick and his production team who recreate the 17th century in a way that makes the viewer truly appreciate what life must have been like at the time. Watching the women, most notably the beautiful Marisa Berenson, sashaying about in glamourous dresses, one wonders how they could endure the apparent discomfort of such cumbersome clothing. It's no wonder they took so many baths. And watching Barry rise in society, one is aware that the society is ultimately every bit as superficial and uncouth as the rogue \\"hero\\" himself.<br /><br />The movie is slow, very slow, but so was life in the era depicted, and the achievement of \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is that it transports the viewer to an earlier but far from simpler time in a way that no other film has done. The cinematography and art direction are peerless, as is Leonard Rosenman's score which adapts the work of some of the greatest classical composers.<br /><br />Most movies, even the good ones, are as light as popcorn, easily forgotten when the lights come back on. The patient viewer who gives \\"Barry Lyndon\\" a chance to work its magic will be rewarded with a true cinematic experience.<br /><br />Brian W.

B0002I831S|5.0|I have waited for years for Star Trek to be released like this as a <br />whole season.  This is one of my all time favorite TV shows, but <br />I always fiqured when it was released it would be priced reasonable.  I guess Paramount(Viacom) must feel another gouging <br />is due to people like us.  I've bought a couple of the Star Trek  <br />movies but for an almost 40 year old TV series that has been rerun <br />on TV for more than 30 years I don't think I'll be bending over <br />to pick this one up.  Again, I loved the show, nothing less than 5 <br />stars.
0765310015|5.0|This is a fantastic book and a wonderfull beginning to series which just keeps getting better and better. This book is extremely well written, with interesting and believable characters which are a step(or three!) above the usual fantasy fare. The complex narrative may be too much for some, but stick with it and you will be rewarded with possibly one of the best series of recent times. But the best thing about Erikson's work is how fast he writes, since the series debut, he has put out at least one book every year! Take that Robert Jordan!
B00005JLO2|3.0|First let me say that anyone who thinks the Four Feathers (2002) is too long or too boring should just stick to MTV or Michael Bay films. If anything the film is too short. It doesn't take a genius to see the huge continuity problems in the editing (SEVERAL major plot points are wrapped up in seconds each time, and several others are obviously missing). I've read elsewhere that Kapur was forced to edit the film down from three hours plus. No doubt this was that idiot Harvey Weinstein's doing. I can't understand why he can't see how many films he's ruined by hacking them to bits (including every martial arts import he's ever released). NONETHELESS, I did marginally like the film. Still, I couldn't appreciate it as an epic at this length. This film desparately needs that extra hour of footage restored to it. SOOOO Harvey, when is it gonna happen...........
B000002MP2|5.0|This album is possibly the last perfect album of our day.  Dookie is the pinnacle of Green Day's career, a career that influenced countless musicians and music fans alike to rebel, expand their horizons, and rock out in a way that had never been done before.  I first owned this album on casette in 1994 when I was in fourth grade and it hastn't left my regular rotation yet.  This is timeless music, punk rock or not, no band since Green Day has been able to put together such a blend of raw energy, talent, and brilliant song writing.  Everything Green Day wrote before Dookie was simply a prelude and everything after, an attempt to reach that level of excellence displayed on their major label debut album.      To all of you who give this album a low ranking with bias toward another Green Day work, be advised that you are not a true Green Day fan as this is their premier artistic moment.  Insomniac was an attempt to darken their sound in response to critics who claimed that Dookie was too catchy.  Nimrod was a crossroad that featured \\"Time of Your Life\\" which unfortunately influenced too many mainstream listeners to listen to Green Day, only to be disapointed with their earlier releases that were concerned with drugs, booze, (...) and the dregs of teenagehood.  Warning was Green Day's last release and proved to alienate many of their previous fans who craved catchy, heavy, fast, distorted punk-pop.  Has Green Day gone soft?  Hopefully not as the radio cut off of their looming \\"American Idiot\\" proves to be as raucous as ever while touching upon a new subject for Green Day, politics.      Buy Dookie if you want to hear what all the fuss over Green Day was about.  Their later albums show too much evidence of mainstream influence and their earlier work was not quite focused yet.      And to the kid who rated this album because he first heard \\"Time of Your Life\\" and was astonished when he later heard \\"When I Come Around\\" and found that they were by the same artist, don't waste the time of true music fans that aren't afraid to listen to music that doesn't appear on the top 40 station.  It's not like Green Day is hard to find.  It's even pretty prevalent on alt. rock stations and MTV since 1995 for God's sake, so I'd have to say its sad that you didn't hear \\"When I Come Around\\" until after the release of \\"Nimrod.\\"  Buy Dookie; hear Green Day's premier work.
014028009X|4.0|Bridget Jone's Diary is a laugh-out loud funny novel but, it was also disturbing at the same time.  It was upsetting to see a woman become self-obsessed with her weight (lost 72, gained 72 throughout the year) and will do anything to get her thigh circumfrance down 1.5 centimetres.  However, her humerous whining makes me forgive Fielding. <br />Her witty charm about being a Singleton and then being together with someone which is only doomed to fail.  Her illicit affair with her boss and her non-existant black skirt, her drinking and eating binges and her mother all sum up the life of a woman who will never please herself.  Just when something good happens to Bridget, her mother, a break-up or her inability to set the VCR comes crashing down her. <br />This is a book that woman can read and appreciate wether single, divorced or happily coupled with someone.

B0000028RR|5.0|When I compared SOAD to RATM, I did mean they were both political. It's not that SOAD's politics are better than RATM's politics. Rage's politics are better than SOAD's by a long shot. But, I like the fact that Serj writes in metaphors, it gives you something to think about. As for who I like better, It's a  very close race. Rage's music is more complex, but System's music is harder, even thought it's simple. They don't sound alike at all, you're right Zeyus. I should have been more specific when I compared them, thanks again Zeyus. <br /> <br />As for this album, I love every song except for township rebellion-#9. I've always hated rap and rock/metal mixed, but there's something about this band that I love. Zach's voice is a little annoying, but once you get past that, it's just amazing. <br /> <br />KarlMarx, you don't have good taste in music period! (Except for Rage against the Machine and Soundgarden) You don't have a life, every time I come on amazon, which isn't very often anymore, you are trahsing another SOAD fan. Nobody cares about what you have to say, so just stop.  <br /> <br />SOAD Fanatic, you're kind of annoying too, you're ALMOST as bad as KarlMarx, only you talk alot of sense whereas Karl doesn't. Oh and Rick Rubin is not SOAD's producer, he's been producing bands since the 80s, i.e. Slayer, Beastie boys, etc. You need to get your facts straight before you go and write a review on something.  <br /> <br />That's about all I wanted to say. <br /> <br />Thank you again for pointing out my mistake Zeyus! :) <br />That is, if you were talking to me, because I made the same mistake SOAD Fanatic made.

038533348X|5.0|Vonnegut uses a fast-paced chapter and sentance structure, combined with dark humor to litterily propell you through his works. <br /> <br />\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is no exception. His style of writing and the books compelling theme drag the reader from cover to cover in the blink of an eye (no small task for a 287-page book) while delivering a vivid picture of the world contained within those pages. <br /> <br />As I said, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is 287-pages in length and has 127 chapters. Each chapter is barely more then 2-3 pages in length, making it quite easy to read this book on a busy schedule. Vonnegut's briskly paced style means you can read a chapter here and there at your leasure and still enjoy the book. <br /> <br />On a side note, Vonnegut's short story; &lt;u>\\"Harrison Bergeron\\"&lt;/u> is featured in one of the textbooks for an English class I'm taking at this time. The same story is also avalible in Vonnegut's 1968 short story collection; \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\". <br /> <br />I also highly reccomend Vonnegut's other novel; \\"Slaughterhouse-5, or the Children's Crusade\\", which is, for those who don't already know, a fictional tale based off of Vonnegut's own experiences after having been captured by the Germans and sent to work at an underground slaughterhouse in Dresden durring World War II.
B00003CX8U|5.0|This is probably one of my most often watched movies.  I had skipped this movie for the longest time, thinking it was all about dance.  It's not.  Those in Theater tell me this is a good look at what goes on behind a big Broadway production.  Those who knew Bob Fosse think it's a narcissistic self-serving film.  I didn't think so.  In my opinion, this is a movie about life, using an unfinished Broadway musical as a metaphor for all the loose ends we leave behind us when we leave this world behind.  The movie is quite a roller-coaster ride of funny, sad, dramatic, and light-hearted scenes.  Such is life.
B00005JMX6|4.0|\\"The Girl Next Door\\" is  the teenage version of \\"Pretty Woman,\\" with instead of a hooker with a heart of gold, you have a porn star. <br />Emile Hirsch plays a goody-goody, class president, by the book kind of guy. Elisha Cuthbert is the porn star next door neighbor. <br />The movie has everything a teen movie is supposed to have. It's funny for the most part, and there's the standard gratuitous flesh. <br />Where the movie faults in in the ending, which is pretty unrealistic. The lameness of it takes away from the cuteness of the movie.  Besides the last ten minutes, the movie is an enjoyable movie, though it's not as hot as Cuthbert.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is one of the only purely talented musicians/singers of 2004. Her voice draws you in, sooths you, just like her unbelievable ability to play the piano. The album is even better than her first effort, \\"Songs In A Minor\\" which is also simply fabulous. The album is almost too good to be true. The standouts are: Karma, If I Ain't Got You, Diary (DEFINITELY THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!), You Don't Know My Name, So Simple, Feeling U, Feeling Me, Slow Down and Samsonite Man. I know I have named practically all the songs on the album, but I could'nt leave any of them off. Wake Up, Dragon Days, Heartburn, Nobody Not Really, If I Was Your Woman, and When You Really Love Someone are also extremely great. I can find no complaints to tell you except it is too short - it should go on forever. I cannot WAIT until her next album, to see if it is as good. I think it will be, though. <br />I can't get over the fact that some people actually like artists such as Britney Spears, Christina Milian, or Shawnna. Make sure you by this album - it's amazing. The bonus DVD is really interesting, too.  <br /> <br />Tom Peter James Evans from Newport Pagnell, Milton Keynes, England, Great Britain, Europe, reporting to the people from other places in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and Asia.

0684800713|5.0|Not many writers are like Ernest Hemingway. His style is unique and nobody will ever write like him. He is one of my favorite novelists ever and his \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" one of my most beloved books ever. I know there are some problems with the narrative --and there is animal cruelty that bothers me so much, but, still, this is one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />The feeling I had when I first read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is impossible to compare to any other work. The vitality and joy of this story was what I liked most. Despite the fact that it is a sad story, I can feel life coming from every paragraph. The book deals with the Lost Generation, those youngsters who lost their dreams and hope with the First World War. Afterwards they were so displeased with life that their motto was \\"Live fast, die young\\".<br /><br />The pages of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" perfectly translates this momentum: every second counts, do it now, because in the future you may not be able to do again. This is the feeling that all the characters are after. The feeling of being fulfilled. However, it is not easy to find out what fulfill each person --so that is the reason why they make so many mistakes.<br /><br />At some point, Bill, one of the most joyful characters of the book, says, \\"Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks.' This perfectly summarizes the point Hemingway is trying to state. This is what he believed by the time he wrote the novel -- in the mid 20's. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is one of the books that best show the way the writer believed people should live. All things that Hemingway liked in his life were there, like beautiful women, boxing, fishing, bullfighting and traveling through Europe. This may not be the most appropriated lifestyle for many people, but it sure worked in Europe circa 1925.<br /><br />Not many writers would be able to writer a book like that. If one thinks of the matter of the fact, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is almost a book about nothing. However it never let the reader feel bored. The characters' lives can be boring --they are bored most of the time. But the reader is fully immersed in that universe that he feels like part of the group. It is not hard to believe that Jake, Lady Brett, Bill, Cohn and the others are not our friends. They are so exposed to us --that in the end we know more about them then themselves. In the end, we know so much about life that we could expect from a book. And Ernest Hemingway is one of the few who can do that.t never let the reader feel bored.

B0002EXFNI|4.0|`the girl next door' directed by Luke Greenfield is a new rendition of the `Risky Business' plot adapted with the hindsight of watching a generation of John Hughes high school student movies. The movie is not quite a remake, but the story comes so close to the movie that launched Tom Cruise's career that comparisons are inevitable and very useful in evaluating the new movie.<br /><br />For starters, the lead male actor, Emile Hirsh, is only 17 years old, so he is totally convincing as a high school senior, because that is exactly what he is. He brings the kind of innocence and genuineness to the role that is very hard for an older actor to simulate. Unfortunately for this movie, he lacks Cruise's mischievous energy in `Risky Business', so that Hirsch never seems to quite rise above the 17 year old persona to make us believe he can pull off the stunt which saves him from the story's problem. The role of `the girl next door' is played well by Elisha Cuthbert who, unlike the known prostitute in `Risky Business' is a porn star, a fact unknown to the boy's character until well into the second act. This adds a new element to the story, but I'm afraid Ms. Cuthbert, who is a knockout to look at and a capable actor, does not quite generate the excitement I sensed with Rebecca DeMornay in `Risky Business'.<br /><br />In this story, the heavy is played by a business associate of the woman, a sex movie actor / producer rather than a pimp. And, although a fair amount of effort is made to hide the nature of the event that puts our hero into his pickle that drives the action in the third act, the eventual situation is as much a surprise as the sun's rising in the morning. And, it is made obvious as soon as the `Risky Business' plot line similarity is seen, if you did not happen to see this similarity prominently printed on the cover of the DVD case.<br /><br />Copying a story line from an earlier source does not necessarily mean the new version will be weaker. It only means that the game is not in any surprise in the main story line, but in how well you implement the plot. Virtually all historical dramas are based on this premise. Shakespeare built over a third of his output on the history of English kings as well known to his audience as we know about Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower. He also used well-known fictional stories as in `The Taming of the Shrew' and `A MidSummer's Night Dream'. Homages to fictional story lines do have the advantage of being able to freely make changes to the plot. While the television drama `The Missiles of October' with William Devane and Martin Sheen and the recent '13 Days' with Kevin Costner handled the Cuban missile crisis in very different ways, they could not change the basic story line. `the girl next door' does succeed in a surprise at the end by which the teenager outsmarts the heavy, saves the day, brings his foreign student in from Cambodia, and ends up at Georgetown in a new BMW roadster. The result is no surprise whatsoever in a movie like this, only the way you get there.<br /><br />In general, the supporting cast is not quite as strong as in `Risky Business'. I was surprised to spot Timothy Bottoms appearing as the lad's father, a very small roll, enough to keep up with the rent after starring in some rather important 70's movies such as `The Paper Chase' and `The Last Picture Show'. The heavies are quirky and worth a few good surprises, but simply not as threatening as DeMornay's pimp.<br /><br />The screenplay and direction are capable, where much use of imagined fears of the lead character are played out as if they really happen, until we snap back to the actor's gazing into the middle distance after having played the scene out in his mind. These digressions contain one rather dramatic surprise, and I have mixed feelings on whether they add to the enjoyment or detract. I have a sense that the movie would have been better if the creative forces behind the movie had found a better way to deal with these points in the story.<br /><br />For no premium price, the DVD has my favorite feature, a voice-over commentary by the director. Unfortunately, the commentary is a solo act and simply is not as entertaining as, for example, several I have heard from Kevin Smith and his ensemble cast and producer.<br /><br />The selection of published music behind the action is complementary, but not very distinctive until very near the end, when we are hit by a surprise appearance of Donovan's `Atlantis' followed by the always dramatic The Who's `Baba O'Reilly' which has probably appeared in more movies and commercials now than the song `Singing in the Rain'.<br /><br />This is a good, enjoyable movie with good value to the extras on the DVD. It will not replace `Risky Business' among classic teen problem movies.to deal with these points in the story. <br /> <br />For no premium price, the DVD has my favorite feature, a voice-over commentary by the director.

B0002DB52M|5.0|Every decade or so comes along a movie that breaks new ground. Dogville is in this category. The use of the minimalist soundstage set works very well. I found myself easily picturing what this town would have looked like and I was there.  <br /> <br />We are watching a play. A dark, grim, bleak but authentic portrait of a human condition. Yes, it's long and at times slow but it's realistic because Dogville is a really slow town (one I'd be happy to avoid). I was fascinated by the story. <br /> <br />This is the first Lars von Trier movie I've seen (I now intend to see every thing he has done) and I was completely unaware of the anti-American controversy until after I watched it. It is far more believable than any number of Hollywood depictions of atrocities in other cultures. <br /> <br />I finished watching the movie 12 hours ago and I have been thinking about Grace all day. Kidman is superb. As is Paul Bettany. The work from the rest of the stellar cast is also very strong.  <br /> <br />I had a really hard time trying to vocalize my feelings about Dogville to a friend right after I watched it mostly because I have nothing to compare it to. (She said she would rent it right away.) <br /> <br />It's original, the story is unpredictable and I think Lars von Trier succeeds magnificently.  <br /> <br />
B00005JLSE|5.0|When Chicago came out everyone was making a huge deal about it. I rolled my eyes and chose to not see it. Two years later I saw it on TV and I was imediately hooked. The plot and musical parts are intertwined so well. I loved it.

B00008CLOA|5.0|I should begin by saying that I have an SACD player, but am listening with 2 channels.  I have listened to several previous versions, in particular the original LP (US pressing), and the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs remaster on LP.  The former was beautiful but disturbing, alarm bells and sharp entrances could have you jumping out of your skin, but that was all right, because this material should be disturbing.  The original MF remaster was beautiful sonically, but its mood was mellow, with the rough edges smoothed for easy listening.  I found that a misreading of the artistic intent, and I both loved and hated it.  And now I have this new version, and everything is made right.  The SACD is clearly sonically much better than previous CD versions, comparable to the MF remaster, but retains the sharp edges, which IMHO makes the recording that much more an effective artistic statement.  We had to wait 30 years, but at last bravo for getting it right.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I am really impressed with this movie and all of the performances in it. It is a really complex movie (acting wise) and was handled perfectly by Ashton Kutcher. I kept waiting to see flashes of Kelso, but to my suprise there weren't any. This DVD is absoloutly loaded, there is the theatrical version of the movie, the director's cut, an alternate ending, and countless other documentaries and special features on one two sided disc.<br /><br /> I am usualy not a fan of alternate endings but it seemed that for this movie it was almost nessesary, it was one of those movies that had you involved in what was going on and thinking to yourself \\"well why doesn't he just do this or why doesn't he just do that\\", and that's were the alternate ending comes into play. I would suggest watching the director's cut first, then watchin the alternate ending, this movie will blow your mind- have fun!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney's new album is definitely different than her previous work. It's more funky and has that electronic type sound to it, very Madonna-like. Brit has written more for this album but that's not necessarily a good thing. I've found that there are always a few songs Brit should have left off her records. For this one, only half of this album is actually worth listening to. Songs like \\"Showdown\\", \\"The Hook Up\\" and \\"Touch of my Hand\\" are just ridiculous and stupid. Unfortunately, most of this CD is forgetable. There are a few good ones: \\"Toxic\\", \\"Early Mornin'\\" and \\"Shadow\\" are great songs along with the more typical sounding Britney tunes \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Brave New Girl.\\" Songs like \\"Outrageous,\\" \\"Boom Boom\\" and \\"Me Against the Music\\" are good dance songs but really cliche and will easily be forgotten. This project is average and has done ok for Brit but she's gonna have to do better next time. I hear she has a greatest hits album coming out. These days, a greatest hits says \\"Desperate for money\\" and/or \\"end of my career.\\" I'm hoping she can pull through and come up with something really great for her next project! <br /> <br />
B00027JYLC|4.0|I am glad that this movie was finally released on DVD but the sound quality hasn't really changed much and towards the end the whites are so bright you can barely see the people's faces, that is the only reason I didn't give the DVD version 5 stars. <br /> Usually after people watch this movie they say how could this film be banned anywhere or cause so much contreversy? For the answer to that you would have to think about when it was relaeased and how very out of the ordinary this film must have seemed, and then think about all of the movies since then that have been about freaks of any kind and have actually used real freaks. THe only movie I can think of that used real \\"freaks\\" is a documentary called Being Different. <br /> This movie was deep in the fact that you can't judge a book by it's cover and maybe the people who appear to be \\"normal\\" are really the freaks and vice versa. I feel that this movie is timeless, but others will look at it as outdated and boring, but the key is thinking about the time period that this film was released and how crazy and over the top it must have been back then. Give it a chance I bet you will be suprised!
B0002IU988|2.0|I only liked 2 maybe 3 songs out of this album...It's not great at all. The lead singer kills it...The rest of the band sounds totally awesome and jamming but that's cause they have been in a band before (Creed of course) and know how to play and do awesome together. It seems they just picked this lead singer up off the streets somewhere and tried to make him into Scott Sapp..but he can't be replaced and Creed sounded awesome with him but now he's gone :sigh: Anyways, the lead singer destroyed it for me...He sounds more like he's trying to yodel more than sing and he's very hard to understand. I get tired of his Do-do-doo's and his yelling of ohhhhh, anybody can sing like that. Thank god they included the lyrics for this CD or else you would be lost. I would recommend getting and listening or if you have them listen to them again, the Creed albums. They are so much better sounding and nsync than this album is. What I did and am very happy I did. I know this is there first album and the former members of Creed need to carry on but get a new singer please...Someone that knows how to sing. I give them credit on 3 songs, 1 I really like, that are awesome but that's it. They sound like Creed (guitars, drums, and bass) but again the lead singer kills it all....I took a chance and it didn't work out all that well and that's the way it goes sometimes....atleast I like 3 songs out of it anyways... <br /> <br />Creditable songs:  <br /> <br />Open Your Eyes - Their best song of the album...Great jammin and meaningful tune..Love it...My favorite <br /> <br />Down To My Last - Great jammin tune...again his singing and screeching gets in the way at times but still a pretty cool song - 2nd best one of the album.... <br /> <br />Broken Wings - Another great meaningful song but his singing and tone kills it...still it's pretty good...3rd best... <br /> <br />
B000002LK1|5.0|I am a relatively young fan of DM, considering I was just eight years old when Violator came out, but I had the privilege of growing up with this album, Music for the Masses, and Songs of Faith and Devotion.  They defined my youth in so many ways, but with each subsequent listen, they don't get tired.  Even songs that were written two decades ago have this power to stay current and remain timelessly brilliant.  For instance, last night I played Black Celebration through my headphones, and it stuns me how good it still sounds, both technically and musically.  Every track is beautiful, and the order is perfect too.  With all honesty, I can say the same with nearly every DM album.  When I put in DM, I know that I'm not going to have to skip filler tracks, but I will listen to the album straight through, the way the very best albums are played.  Since my youth, I have obtained every album from Some Great Reward (1984) to Exciter (2001), and to this day, Depeche remains my very favorite band.   <br /> <br />An interesting observation from Andrew Fletcher (particularly about Black Celebration) is that its songs are lovely, but not really commercial.  Yet, I believe, that is the precise reason why DM were so hugely successful- the songs weren't simply factory-produced pop, but completely unique and beautiful, the kind of songs that wouldn't likely be played on mainstream radio today.  (I was surprised to find \\"Dream On\\" on the radio a few years ago.)  Depeche, in its career, has produced, obviously IMHO, some of the best albums ever recorded.  If you can listen to twenty-year-old songs with the same delight as the first time you heard it, you must acknowledge the talent and capabilities of the band.  Their new stuff is also good- Exciter took some time to get used to, and admittedly it is the one album I do skip around a bit, but it too has some beautiful and insightful songs.  If you are a newer fan of DM, check out everything from Some Great Reward on.  That era was theturning point for DM, and will capture the mastery of the time and all to come later.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Well it's about time! Given Parsons usual two/three year gap between albums, I was expecting a new one in 2002 (following 1999's The Time Machine). Then, the unthinkable happened. The band split and longtime members Stuart Elliott and Ian Bairnson departed. I couldn't believe it! First Eric Woolfson, now Elliott and Bairnson. My favorite band that I have loved since I was a child were going their separate ways. But Parsons will not be stopped. Even when his band splits, he always seems to find new and talented musicians to carry on his rock legacy, which he proved when he came back with Try Anything Once in 1993. Now well into the 21st century, Parsons comes back again and he follows a valid path into the world of electronica. At first, I was a bit skeptical about this album because not only were Elliott and Bairnson gone, but so was Andrew Powell, who, like Woolfson, had long been associated with Parsons and whose orchestrations complemented Parsons music perfectly. Well, even without Powell, Parsons manages to bring his familiar progressive sounds to a new generation, mixing it with electronic sounds to form a winning combination! Given Parsons passion for spectacular sound quality, he gives us nothing but the best here and that's one of the things that always stands out about his music. Parsons is constantly improving on his music and pushing the boundries of sound with each new album. What stands out about \\"A Valid Path\\" particularly is not only the new electronica and clear and distinct sound, but the fact that, on \\"We Play The Game,\\" Parsons plays keyboards, guitar, and sings the lead vocal. Parsons proves that he is a darn good singer and,with such an outstanding voice, one has to wonder why he doesn't sing the lead more on his albums. I only hope that Alan will consider singing the lead on future projects. Another highlight is \\"A Recurring Dream Within a Dream.\\" This remix of the Project classic from Parsons first album, \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination,\\" features his son Jeremy, and puts a fresh spin on the tune,which also includes \\"The Raven,\\" giving us one of the best Parsons remixes ever. Other highlights include the title track \\"Return to Tunguska\\" and \\"More Lost Without You\\" featuring P.J. Olsson of Pink Floyd. \\"You Can Run\\" is a catchy tune that features Parsons veteran David Pack on vocals. There is also a remix of \\"Mammagamma\\" from the \\"Eye in the Sky\\" album, which sounds even better today than it did back in 1982. Parsons ends the album on a strong note with the instrumental \\"Chomolungma\\" featuring John Cleese. My only complaint is that the album seemed too short. I wanted more tracks and I want to hear more songs sung by Alan in the future. He is so talented I'd hate to have that superb voice of his go to waste. Regardless,Parsons proves once again that his music can stand the test of time.
B00008S2VG|5.0|One of Madonna's best!  If you take the time to really listen, you'll have a chance to hear how Madonna feels about 'American Life'.  There is a lot of insight into the effects of success, the choices that are made, and the confusion that it creates.  It's Madonna's trademark for success... a controversial album.  It doesn't let you down.  Excellent!!
B000062XFG|5.0|We see some new uniform styles, some new plot lines, and a deeper look into the Star Trek mythos that made it great. The switching of Doctors was a bit abrupt, and I think having her be a trasporter-phobe was too McCoy-esque to be coincidental; I think the writers were TRYING (too hard) for us to like her. The same goes for trite manner in which Picard's heart replacement needed to be done by (suprise, suprise) Dr. Pulaski. Data's character was developed well, and I liked seeing the cast starting to settle into their roles. A good strong follow-up to a great beginning. This series was crawling in Season One, and definitely walking by the end of Season Two (making the audience wonder just how fast this baby will RUN.) A move that must be owned by the die hard fans, and a few disks borrowed by the casual fan friends of the die hard fan. It will not dissapoint.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I didn't hoped more than I got from this CD. I bought it just to have a CD to be carried in my car. I'm not a Beatle fanatic, I just like their music. I'm sure truly fans don't feel excited with this appearance because they know this album doesn't contain many other wonderful songs (maybe they didn't reach a Number 1 on Top Tens but they were outstanding also), so this is just a nice compilation. <br />As a music fan, I'd recommend this album, for those people who want to hear The Beatles' music, but I think that won't be the same impression for those millions real Beatles fans. <br />That's all: It's a nice CD, no more than that.

B0000027I6|1.0|Without David Gilmour to turn his banal meanderings into real music, Waters has created yet another totally forgettable album.  This cd has four good songs on it, thanks only to the amazing guitar of Jeff Beck.  The remaining fifty minutes of this cd is filled with songs that are so mind-numbingly bland they make elevator music sound like punk-metal by comparison.  One star is a generous rating for this atrocity, given only because it is the least horrible solo album to be inflicted on the public by Roger Waters.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This movie (you can't call it a real documentary) is an entertaining, funny and sometimes moving piece of loony left propaganda. That its main target is richly deserving of our contempt and mockery does not change the fact that this film is intellectually incoherent, contradictory and too full of baseless assertions, fatuous \\"reasoning\\" and downright untruths. The sole fact that he completely ignored the dominant role of Israeli-loyalist neoconservatives in starting the war is reason enough to discount the whole movie. I'm as big an opponent of the president as there is, but let's get a few things straight: he did not steal the 2000 election by disenfranchising black voters in Florida. A bunch of idiots who weren't on the voting rolls because they hadn't voted in 10 years, were felons, went to the wrong voting district, or who were never registered to begin with got mad because they couldn't pollute the system with their illegal votes. The Bush family may be too close to the Saudis, but that didn't cause 9/11 and it wasn't Bush who allowed the bin-Laden family out of the country after 9/11- it was Bush's nemesis Richard Clarke, who only did so after the FBI said that they were not suspects. And if Bush were such a puppet of the Saudis, why did he invade Iraq against the vehement opposition of those same Saudis? And the way Moore portrays it, it's only the poor defenseless black kids who are being victimized by slick and dishonest military recruiters- it's actually rural white kids who are disproportionately represented on the front lines of this war. The military cannibals will take their prey wherever there is poverty and lack of opportunites. No, the real power of this film is in its images, not Moore's discombobulated attempt to fit them all together into a coherent whole. The look on our idiot's president's face as he sat dumbfounded in that Florida classroom for 7 minutes on 9/11 is worth the price of admission(even though I actually bought a ticket to Spider Man and snuck into Fahrenheit to avoid supporting Moore). The scenes of Iraqi atrocities, Bush's arrogance and juvenility, and the unctuous Congressman's reaction when Moore suggested having his son enlist are also great ones. This propaganda movie isn't going to contribute to general enlightenment. It will provoke Bushies, and serve as red meat for lefties, but it will certainly influence the moron majority for whom this film will serve as their only source of information on the state of our country. Even though the immediate outcome of that will be the removal of a dangerous and stupid man from office, this further development of the movie medium as political propaganda does not bode well for this country.an and snuck into Fahrenheit to avoid supporting Moore).

B00006IU73|3.0|Dear friends, this release is unfortunately the weakest effort by the band. For the first time there are mediocre tracks, and the best ones (Sound of Muzak, Strip the soul) are just very good songs. I liked PT's going more commercial, with Stupid Dream, since they were an excellent band and deserved success. So they developed a pop/prog sound, instead of the psychedelic/ambient sound of the first 4 albums. In Absentia is the third cd in this fashion, and is considered their most \\"rock\\" album, and their best. I can't say i agree. Sure it has some metal riffs, nice playing, crystal (dry) sound, but the new ideas are very few, most of the songs are quite mellow (which is not bad), and the word \\"repetition\\" immediately comes to mind. So, if you're new to PT and looking for their characteristic sound, try their pre-2000 efforts.
B00004WF68|2.0|I don't care about \\"the artist's intent\\" in this instance...the UK version of this album is vastly inferior to the U.S. release. I pined for years and years to get the U.S. \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" on CD, and my wait was finally rewarded a few years back with the reissue entitled \\"Heaven Is in Your Mind\\" (which was the original title of the U.S. release of this album...I've actually seen a copy so-titled on LP, though \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" was the more common release). <br /> <br />Never mind that this one has \\"Paper Sun\\" as a bonus track...the U.S. version leads off with it and has a much more sensible sequence overall, and the reissue puts the duff tracks from the UK version (e.g. \\"Utterly Simple\\") at the end where they can be avoided. <br /> <br />The only virtue this release would have would be the mono mixes, which are probably quite different from the stereo ones as was so often the case in those days. <br /> <br />This has always been one of my favorite albums of all time, but as Stevie says in \\"Smiling Phases,\\" \\"Do yourself a favor\\"...get the U.S. one!
B000286RKW|5.0|Martin Scorsese's \\"Goodfellas\\" is absolutely brilliant. Being based on a true story, you find your self amazed by the events that actually happened. \\"Goodfellas\\" possesses everything a good mob movie should...a great story, great dialogue, violence, and a bit of humor when needed. Some dialogue in the film is of course, not meant to be funny, but some of the things certain characters say in this film, just makes you laugh. Don't get me wrong, this is not at all a comedy, I just think it has some funny parts, Every good movie does. Phenomenal performances by Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci. The 3 leads just simply own this film. \\"Goodfellas\\" is also a violent film, not overly violent, but can get a bit graphic at times. Bottom line, I don't care if you don't like these types of movies, if you own a DVD player...buy \\"Goodfellas\\" 2 disc special edition. You'll watch it, and say to yourself, \\"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.\\" I guarentee that.
0345446798|5.0|I've raised six dogs from puppyhood in almost that many decades, and if I'd had McConnell's book during those years, we would all--humans and canines--have been much happier. Certainly we humans (and our friends and neighbors) would have been in better humor, and not only because of McConnell's witty, wise, supple prose. A good read from start to finish, THE OTHER END OF THE LEASH is chock full of information I can't believe I have done without until now. If you live with a dog or are considering doing so, this book is required reading (and you'll love every chapter). If you don't live with a dog and are only mildly curious about the differences between us people and creatures of the canid persuasion, I'd still urge you to buy this book. Time spend in these rich pages causes us to understand more fully what it means to be human.
B000002J6F|5.0|Stephen Stills hit his musical stride with Manassas. It ranks right up there with the best 60s and 70s multi album sets such as \\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Beatles (AKA White Album)\\", \\"Eat a Peach\\", \\"Exile on Main St.\\" etc. (As a matter of fact, my then girl friend gave me <br />copies of  \\"Eat a Peach\\" and \\"Manassas\\" in June 1972 for my birthday).   <br /> <br />This cd loosely resembles the White Album in that the music on the cd swoops from various styles such as Carribean influenced rock to bluegrass to acoustic gems such as \\"So Begins the Task\\", \\"Johnny's Garden\\", and ends with a bang with the rocking \\"the Treasure\\". The last song \\"Blues Man\\" is a very fitting acoustic tribute to Hendrix. <br /> <br />How could Stills go wrong with Byrds and Burrito Bros. veteran <br />Chris Hillman and great musicians such as Al Perkins, Jim Gordon, etc. ? Every song here is a gem and I used to wear out <br />side 2 and 3 on the original vinyl (the bluegrass and acoustic sides) listening to Colorado, So Begins the Task, Johnny's  <br />Garden, Bound to Fall, Fallen Eagle over and over again. <br /> <br />As with George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\", Stills had a one <br />shot creative explosion and never quite reached that height again. To summarize, this cd is one of the most worthy additions to a 70s <br />folk-rock or CSNY collection.  <br />
B00005JMUA|4.0|Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, Vol. 2 completes the vengeful tale of the Bride (Uma Thurman).  Although there is plenty of violence in the second chapter, it is nowhere near the over-the-top blood spilling of the first film.  Instead, the film goes into the relationship of the Bride and Bill (David Carradine) and the Bride's past (we even learn her actual name).  One excellent scene is the training of the Bride with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) that contains some excellent Kung Fu action.  The best fight sequence is between the Bride
B00001ZULV|4.0|I love the band &#34;Genesis&#34;, both the Peter Gabriel era and the Phil Collins era. I never got into the Ray Wilson era, and obviously that's okay as it didn't last too long. &#34;Turn it On Again&#34; is a good sampler of &#34;Genesis&#34; for those that are curious on what the band is about. Granted it is far from a perfect collection, and I'll explain why.  Out of the 17 tracks on the album, 14 are from the Collins era, only 2 from the Gabriel era, and one from the Wilson era. The Collins era is represented heavily by &#34;Invisible Touch&#34; and &#34;We Can't Dance&#34;, which together make up 9 of the 17 songs. Let it be known that Genesis got popular during the Collins era, as the sound was polished pop. They sold millions of records, made top ten lists, and were played continuously on radio. The progressive-rock era of Peter Gabriel was pure genius at work. However, the sound is complex and challenging, and the songs are not radio friendly, so for those reasons it never really caught onto many music consumers. For that reason, there aren't many Gabriel songs on this hits collection, as in his era there weren't many &#34;hits&#34; per say.  However, Atlantic missed the ball. &#34;Genesis&#34; is wonderful both in progressive rock and pop form. This should have been a two disc best of release, each disc giving equal billing to the Peter Gabriel progressive rock era and the Phil Collins polished pop radio-friendly eras. The songs should have also been released in album form, not the severe edit forms as they are presented here (&#34;Mama&#34;, &#34;Tonight Tonight Tonight&#34;, &#34;Abacab&#34;). Also, even though the Collins era is strongly represented, some of his hits are even missing, including &#34;No Reply at All&#34;, &#34;Home by the Sea&#34;, &#34;Man on the Corner&#34;, and &#34;Keep it Dark&#34;.  Gabriel, Collins, Banks, Rutherford, and Hackett. Five of the most talented and creative musicians in history. Together they created wonderful music, and they all have gone on to bigger and better things, such as solo careers (Collins and Gabriel) or other bands (Rutherford and Hackett). &#34;Genesis&#34; made 30 years of wonderful music. &#34;Turn it on Again&#34; is a good taste of what Genesis is about, but make sure it isn't your only stop on their wonderful music journey. Check out both the 70's progressive era albums and the 80's pop/rock albums. You will be missing out if you don't.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Nickleback have run out of ideas! These are just a collection of tracks on previous albums.

B00005B3Z6|5.0|This series was incredible. It topped all my expectations and then some. It blasts through the conventional and cliche with it's riveting portrayl of the characters and the unique challenges they face. All of the characters are well-rounded, and generally defy any stereotype of \\"gay\\" out there in some way. Aidan Gillen's Stuart Allen Jones is visceral and compelling, but could not possibly survive without the nuanced performances of of the actors who play Vince and Nathan. I fell in love with all the characters by the end. The series is also replete with great comedic moments that often celebrate the characters' resillence in the face of queer opression. You'll laugh, you'll scream, you'll cheer, but straight or gay, you will love this series.

B00003CXXP|4.0|This is a movie that challenges us to understand. It's vision is so vast and futuristic, it needs tons of imagination and post- thought in order to digest the concepts.   In time it will win the respect it deserves. Like \\"Blade Runner\\" or \\"2001\\" when it came out, folks just did'nt get it.  Spielberg's emulation of Kubrick is right on, you have to be familiar with Kubricks works to enjoy the movie. And what's so bad about the Pinochio analogy? So if E.T. had been made in the new millennia, would it have been a disaster? This movie is a must see for all generations.
B00006LLNU|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that I completely agree with samhot's review; read it, he is entirely correct. I'd just like to say that this album is absolutely incredible. Yes, it's true that I understand none of the lyrics, but I could care less. The musical experience that is Sigur Ros requires no lyrics; they evoke the purest emotions more convincingly than any other band I've ever heard. This is an album to be felt, not heard. The songs are composed of usually repetetive harmonies that vary and build with a climax that can only be described as musical bliss (read samhot's review for more musical interpretations). One of my favorite things to do, especially when I'm stressed, is to light some incense and put on this album and just chill. This band takes a few listens to acquire a taste to, and they're definately not for everyone. But if you like atmospheric, flowing music, you should definately like Sigur Ros. Their other album, Agaetis Byrjun, is considerably different in composition, but ultimately has the same sound. I recommend this album highly to anyone who's looking for beautiful, flowing, emotion-provoking music.
0790729628|5.0|Maybe the problem with this movie when it came out, back in the early 80s, wasn't so much the voice over narration or the faux happy ending. Casting Harrison Ford was the blunder, because this movie was made straight after the high of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, so everybody was like \\"Han Solo / Indiana Jones having his sorry behind wacked so bad? I won't buy it\\". Of couse, in time Harison Ford established himself as one of the greatest  actors, and then the movie made sence. <br />Human cloning, internet, cel phones, digital here, digital there, all these where  out of our reach 20 years ago. So this movie describes a future that in some way will cach up with us sooner or later. Simply: this is one of the best movies ever.
B00009V7P8|5.0|When I look back in a few year's time at the music that most impressed me in 2004, the name Damien Rice will jump out at me like a sore thumb. After spending the past year pretty much oblivious to this new singer, I finally came around to his overwhelming appeal and popularity as his debut album began climbing the UK album charts. With little promotion apart from a simple advert on TV, Damien Rice has gone from being a little-known singer to an internationally-acclaimed star and the one to watch over the next year or so. I was in London last weekend (to see Madonna in concert!) and went shopping, and ended up buying Rice's debut album \\"O.\\" I listened to it all the way home on the coach and completely fell in love with it.<br /><br />Released in the summer of 2003, O came along and made a minor impact in the charts despite strong reviews. However, from simple word-of-mouth, the album has gone on to become one of the year's success stories. The sound of the album is basically a good-looking Irish man with a guitar singing songs of extreme melancholy but with immense passion and dedication. His style is distinctive and fresh in an industry flooded with watered-down pop and R'n'B radio-fodder, and from the first song I heard on this album I was hooked. Damien Rice, ladies and gentlemen, is the saviour of the modern music industry.<br /><br />O opens with the fantastic slow song \\"Delicate.\\" With just a guitar, cello and bass Mr. Rice crafts a beautiful and melancholy song that is particularly special to me. The first time I heard it I was remembering the day before when I met someone at the Madonna concert who had a big impact on me, and I couldn't help feeling an immense sadness and regret for not asking for his e-mail address or telephone number to stay in touch. This song perfectly captures those emotions for me, and for many others I am sure it will too. \\"Volcano\\" is a gorgeous and catchy mid-tempo number with a remarkable bass and various percussion instruments, accompanied by gorgeous female vocals. \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" is next and is a particular stand out for me. Rice sings with such passionate yearning. When his voice cracks over the bass and the gentle guitar, you feel everything he is feeling, and then he repeats \\"I can't take my eyes off of you\\" over and over to capture your imagination. The best part of the song, however, comes after the third minute when the female voice comes in again, and it is *absolutely beautiful* - I swear down it will make your heart flutter and you'll sit there in amazement as she sings \\"Did I say that I loathe you?\\"<br /><br />The album's most popular song comes next in the shape of \\"Cannonball.\\" With an instantly recognisable melody, Rice's beautiful vocals and soft guitar-playing warms your heart as you find yourself in familiar territory. \\"\\"Older Chests\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, because of the images it paints in your mind. Damien is once again accompanied by beautiful female vocals towards the end of the song as he sings, \\"Time, always time, on my mind. Pass me by, I'll be fine, just give me time.\\" The next song is the beautiful \\"Amie.\\" With a gorgeous cello that sounds like a revealing sunrise at dawn and a breathtaking string section to close the song, this is one song that you won't forget in a hurry. Absolutely masterful. \\"Cheers Darlin'\\" is a unique song because Rice reveals his humorous personality as he sings drunkenly about his ex-girlfriend and her new lover boy! The gentle clinking of glasses represent the drunk-effect, and the gentle saxophone brings about the melancholy sadness of loss.<br /><br />\\"Cold Water\\" is another highlight of the album for me. It opens beautiful with a sound that is like echoes amongst a chilly pond, the gentle tears of winter rain gracefully skimming the surface. Rice opens the song with \\"Cold, cold water!\\" in a feeble and reclusive voice that is filled with emotion. Just when things get too much for him, Lisa Hannigan's beautifulvoice arrives to support him. Then, the gorgeous and gentle hum of Gregorian chants mingle with Hannigan's vocals and swirl the song around your brain. \\"I Remember\\" is a really remarkable song, but not really one of my favourites. Infact, it's the only song that I don't enjoy on the album. A female voice opens the album and carries on for a few minutes before Rice comes in and screeches his vocals like a man possessed as he battles his inner demons. The song closes with the fantastic \\"Eskimo.\\" The words to describe this song are cute, epic and revealing. Cute because of Damien's voice and the words \\"So I look to my Eskimo friend!\\" and epic because of the grand Opera-vocals that come in towards the end from Doreen Curran. Why revealing though? Just the music is a true revelation that can mean a number of things to the listener. A symbol of strength in dark times, a glimmer of hope in depression - anything.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />The song also has two bonus songs tagged on the end of the album, but they are both a continuation of track 10 which makes Eskimo appear to be 16 minutes in length when it really isn't. This is by far the most beautiful and relaxing album that I have come across since Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\" and Bjork's \\"Vespertine.\\" I have never come across a male vocalist so passionate and dedicated whilst displaying so much emotion. He doesn't overdo it though, because in the case of Mr. Rice, excess is never a problem. I look forward to hearing much more from him the future. There are no options. You simply must buy this album.Then, the gorgeous and gentle hum of Gregorian chants mingle with Hannigan's vocals and swirl the song around your brain. \\"I Remember\\" is a really remarkable song, but not really one of my favourites. Infact, it's the only song that I don't enjoy on the album. A female voice opens the album and carries on for a few minutes before Rice comes in and screeches his vocals like a man possessed as he battles his inner demons. The song closes with the fantastic \\"Eskimo.\\" The words to describe this song are cute, epic and revealing. Cute because of Damien's voice and the words \\"So I look to my Eskimo friend!\\" and epic because of the grand Opera-vocals that come in towards the end from Doreen Curran. Why revealing though? Just the music is a true revelation that can mean a number of things to the listener. A symbol of strength in dark times, a glimmer of hope in depression - anything.    OVERALL GRADE: 10/10    The song also has two bonus songs tagged on the end of the album, but they are both a continuation of track 10 which makes Eskimo appear to be 16 minutes in length when it really isn't. This is by far the most beautiful and relaxing album that I have come across since Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\" and Bjork's \\"Vespertine.\\" I have never come across a male vocalist so passionate and dedicated whilst displaying so much emotion. He doesn't overdo it though, because in the case of Mr. Rice, excess is never a problem. I look forward to hearing much more from him the future. There are no options. You simply must buy this album.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|I am not a Guns 'n' Roses fan, so I was awaiting a Greatest Hits album by the band with the hopes that the songs I liked would be on it.  Now, my patience has been rewarded, and for casual fans like me, that know the band mostly from their buddies who played the albums over and over (and over!), this album will be a decent addition to your collection. <br /> <br />Highlights are mostly from Appetite for Destruction (i.e. \\"Paradise City,\\" \\"Sweet Child o' Mine,\\" and \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\").  There is a curiously large number of covers on this album, which seems like cheating.  It seems strange for a big name band like this to release cover singles (although cover albums like Rush's Feedback and Metallica's Garage, Inc. are fair game). Maybe Axl's seemingly continuous meltdown and the disintegration of the band over the years caused a poisonous atmosphere for the type of collaboration required for writing music. <br /> <br />Having said that, however, the cover tunes are quite good.  My cover benchmark remains April Wine's \\"You Could Have Been a Lady,\\" in that it is superior to the original in every way.  Two of the covers on this album meet this benchmark.  But what is more remarkable about \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and \\"Live and Let Die\\" is that they are two of my favourite songs from the bands that originally recorded them (being the Rolling Stones and Wings, respectively).  G'n'R makes them their own and improves on the originals greatly.  This is partly Axl's voice - it's truly creepy in a way that Mick Jagger's and Paul McCartney's are not - and partly Slash's excellent guitar. <br /> <br />Anyways, I think true G'n'R fans will find little here worth having.  Casual fans like myself, who always wanted some G'n'R in their collection but never got around to it, will likely find this album enjoyable and a good buy.
B000002BFZ|4.0|As an experimental sequel to Vitalogy, Pearl Jam's No Code remains a classic example of Seattle rock. The entire album manages to be an interesting piece of music in its own right, a showcase of the bands talent and diversity.  The best aspects of the album are the strong stylistic shifts between songs, creating an exciting CD overall. The opening ballad \\"Sometimes\\" softly engages Vedder's bleating vocals, yet the band immediately thrusts into the heavy sexy rock of \\"Hail Hail \\"(the definite stand out). \\"Who You Are\\" is another exercise in the band's versatility, evoking the folk sunsety sounds of 1960's rock. \\"Habit\\" is straight grunge, whereas \\"Mankind\\" is almost happy pop-punk.  Alternating between sleepier acoustic numbers and heavier pure rock, Pearl Jam created a seminal album for the 1990's. However, No Code may be better remembered for its classic colorful montage album cover than for its music.  <br />
B00005JKG7|4.0|I David, am sure that Carpenter made a very good movie.  Yet, I'm wondering if he got this idea from Stephen King's short story.  If he did so, he did a great job getting ideal actors & actresses to play the characters.  King's story takes place in a grocery store... yet, both have many similarities otherwise.  Finding this sure intrigued me a lot.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy my Wicked CD,.  The music is fun and exhilerating.  The two lead different female voices are so different.  The CD sounds so wild.  I can't wait tog go to New York and see this! <br />Other CDs I recommend: <br />Avenue Q <br />Sweeney Todd- my Favorite <br />Little Shop of Horrors- the movie still rocks <br />La Traviata- the best opera <br />The Boy from OZ <br />and <br />Voice Lessons To Go (both volumes)- So you can learn how to sing             with all of the performers!
B0000C1733|4.0|can i just say that some people are idiots, giving it like two stars just because it doesnt have around the world or aeroplane on it, and saying they are big fans and then calling the songs \\"all around the world\\", \\"don't stop\\" or spelling it \\"majik\\", they are all amazing songs from an amazing band on this album, who cares if there are a few songs missing? <br />dont listen to any idiots this is a great album you will not regret buying, but it loses ONE, THATS ONE star for missing a couple of good tracks.
B00005U8EM|1.0|Although I admit I have not seen this film since its release in the theaters, it certainly ranks up near the top of the list of one of the WORST movies ever made. This is probably why I have not seen it since. I do love Bill Murray and think he is a great comedic actor. I actually enjoyed the movie until it went back to when he first wakes up in the morning. I did tolerate that once but when it kept repeating that, the movie went from a possible 5 all the way to 0. I rate it a 1 here because there is no lower number to choose. If you have never seen this movie, don't waste your time and money. If you have seen it and like it, please tell me why. You will not change my mind but maybe I can understand some how why you like it.
B000089RVX|1.0|I really hate whenever I hear this band, because people think it represents a genre that doesn't really even EXIST... At least, not where you think it does. <br /> <br />This band tries to copy elements of the Darkwave and Industrial styles, which is okay. Many Americans have tried to accomplish that, few have, but the few that did are pretty good. I myself really doubt these guys did. <br /> <br />No one can do Darkwave and Dark Trance, Electronic Industrial, Dark Rave, and things of that nature, like the Swedish and Germans. This band, advertised greatly as a \\"gothic\\" band at overly commercial and gimmicky stores such as Hot Topic, Gear Zone, etc, is not really, in my mind, ANYTHING compared to what the Swedes and Germans can do. <br /> <br />Get a CD from the guys who can do it. <br /> <br />What I always say about \\"Evanescence\\": \\"People listen to this when they could be listening to German darkwave.\\"
B000003S0I|5.0|It's no secret that King Crimson was never known for a stable lineup. Even by the time Lizard came out, the band was basically Robert Fripp and whoever he could find at the time. Well, the band disintigrated by the time Islands came out. While many fans enjoyed Islands, some thought it was a bit weak, and the rock critics were obviously less than kind about the album. But of course even the criticisms of Islands are mild compared to their live album Earthbound that came out around the same time. But then Fripp decided to resurrect a new King Crimson. New drummer was Bill Bruford, fresh off of Yes, we can bet he left Yes because he sensed the band was to go off the edge with something like Tales From Topographic Oceans (an album reviled by critics and divided by fans), so he left around the Close to the Edge tour in '72. John Wetton was previously in a band called Family (he's on their 1971 album Fearless), and prior to that, Mogol Thrash (which featured former Colosseum vocalist/guitarist James Litherland). Jamie Muir handles the percussion, and David Cross handles the violin and viola. Since Pete Sinfield was out of the picture, a new lyricist was brought in by the name of Richard Palmer-James. It might be a bit weird but this guy was an original member of Supertramp and appeared on their 1970 debut (as a guitarist, if I'm not mistakened). Anyway, Larks Tongues in Aspic starts off with the first part of the title track. I loved the sound of the kalimba (an African thumb piano), and somewhere in the background is David Cross giving us some violin. Then the music gets loud with Fripp's distorted guitar. It stays that way, until the music gets more experimental with violin. \\"Book of Saturday\\" is a vocal cut with Wetton handling the vocals. Pretty mellow and laid-back. \\"Exiles\\" is a Mellotron-centered piece that harkens back to the band's earlier sound, almost like this album's \\"Epitaph\\". \\"The Talking Drum\\" features some talking drum in the background, but basically this is an experiment with Wetton's bass and Bruford's drum. For some reason, I couldn't get in to \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part II\\", it seems to exist as just guitar distortion, but the rest of the album is great, and for anyone in to Crimson, this is a must have.
0156027321|5.0|As the rest of the reviewers have noted, the first half of the book is a bit slow - mostly character development. Although after reading the book, one realizes the first half if necessary to understand the character.   <br /> <br />This book was not at all what I had expected. If you get \\"grossed out\\" easily, you may not want to read this book since a lof of it deals with butchering animals (and human's as well). However, it all fits in with the story and is not excessive. <br /> <br />If you do read this book, you will rewarded with a beautiful tale of a beautiful character and his most extraordinary story. Be prepared for a surprise ending! All in all, I loved this book and it will become part of my permanent collection.
B000003S0B|4.0|Well, I have to say, partially. Many people say that In the Wake of Poseidon is a pale rehash of their debut. Everyone knows how King Crimson was never known for a steady lineup. Here the band was already witnessing changes. Ian McDonald was now out of the picture. Greg Lake was now just doing vocals duties on all but one of the vocal cuts (he didn't play bass here, Peter Giles, brother of Michael did). Mellotron duty was now handled by Fripp himself, and sax was handled by Mel Collins (a guy who would find himself with numerous groups like Camel, The Alan Parsons Project, Clannad, and much more). Of course after this album, Lake was to team up with Keith Emerson and Greg Lake to form one of the big-name prog rock acts, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. About the accusations of this album being a copy of their debut, well, let's examine the songs. \\"Pictures of a City\\" does bear resemblance to \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\". Similar jazzy sound, dominated by wind instruments. \\"Cadence & Cascade\\" is the mellow, laid-back piece that draws comparisons to \\"I Talk to the Wind\\". But there's a major difference here: Gordon Haskell is the guy providing the vocals here, who obviously sounds a lot different from Lake, and seems to fit in with the song just fine. The title track is the Mellotron epic in the vein of \\"Epitaph\\". But what King Crimson done on the second half of the album really sounds little what they already done on their debut. \\"Cat Food\\", for example, is a quirky little piece with humorous lyrics, with guest Keith Tippet on piano. Nothing like that was done on their debut. Then you have \\"Devil's Triangle\\", which is a sinister Mellotron experiment partially borrowed from Gustav Holst's The Planets. The music really goes off the experimental deep-end, and somewhere you get to hear a reprise of \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\" (the song) amongst all the noise. I love how the music ends all mellow and acoustic with the third and final \\"Peace\\", with just acoustic guitar and Greg Lake's vocals. Although their debut is the stronger album, this is still an album worth getting, after you get In the Court of the Crimson King.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have not heard such a good CD in probably 5 years! There is not one bad song! If this guy does not make BIG TIME then I give up....
0060934719|1.0|Neil Gaiman wrote a fairy tale in a fairy tale vernacular, a huge deviation from other works (that I actually enjoyed) like American Gods and Neverwhere and even the Sandman comic series. I realize it's probably a typical fairy tale, but I can't help comparing it with the likes of Tad Williams and Gregory Maguire and Gaiman's other books. This one was written as though it was for small children (and then you get a sex scene and once a well-placed four-letter word, which were both just weird).  It was as episodic as The Wizard of Oz, and the coincidences were so unbelievable that they had me rolling my eyes in places.  Gaiman is usually a creative genius.  What happened?
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is one of the most creative movies that I have ever seen. The stories of each of the different characters are soo interesting, and the movie explores a lot of the issues of addicts. I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a truly amazing movie.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I agree with all the stuff from above. Where oh where are the movies I remember? Thank goodness I actually invested in a laserdic player. Too bad it is dying and you can't get a replacement. <br /> <br />Greedo shooting first - \\"Worst movie decision EVER!\\"
B00003CXI1|4.0|No question that the book is great, and the movie itself is excellent.  This being said, the DVD is extremely disappointing.  No extended scenes, no \\"making of\\", a bunch of worthless cheap, CD-ROM style features, and one - ONE! - interview.  Very, very disappointing. <br /> <br />I know that the lord of the Rings has spoiled all of us, but that's not even average.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is great storytelling.  The characters are fleshy, gritty, real, raw and lovable the effects are beautiful and the acting is excellent.  Perfect for fans of epic science fiction.  Worth every penny.  After a few episodes, you'll be hooked.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I saw Kill Bill, Volume 2 in the theatres and on first watch, I considered it vastly superior to the first Kill Bill.  But after having picked up the DVD release the second it was released, and then tried to rewatch it all the way through, I realized it was a smoke screen:  Volume 2 is better than the first, but it's still deeply flawed and not even close to the lasting impact of Reservoir Dogs, or even Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br />There are moments of greatness:  Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver is on fire, playing the gleeful, deliberate evil of the character to perfection as she gives what may be the greatest Tarantino monologue since Samuel L. Jackson's \\"the weak and the shepherd\\" speech in Pulp Fiction.  Tarantino deserves marks for seeing the sleazy charm in Hannah.  David Carradine is perfection as Bill, stunningly charismatic, although without giving any spoilers, I should warn you that you won't get to see him fight very much.  You can tell Tarantino got a kick out of having Gordon Liu play the white-browed mystic Pai Mei, and Tarantino chose a great child actress for the crucial role of \\"BB\\", Perla Haney-Jardine, who becomes probably the youngest actor ever to nail that eccentric Tarantino tone. <br /> <br />The problems?  Episodic plotting, cheesy touches, overlong scenes and a howlingly dissatisfying climax.    Neither Kill Bill film had a satisfying narrative, concentrating on filmmaking virtuosity and great shots rather than cohesive storytelling, and while the greatest scenes still pop out at you, they don't add up to a journey you'd want to revisit over and over.  And in Kill Bill, Vol. 2, you have to wade through a lot of crap to get to the good stuff:  The Mexico sequence is excruciating, featuring a pimp character, Esteban Vihaio, whom nobody cares about, played by an actor, Michael Parks, whom Tarantino just loves for no reason.  (Parks also played the dropdead boring sheriff in the first Kill Bill.) <br /> <br />Perhaps he was embarrassed for the overload of gore in the first Kill Bill, because Tarantino piled on the sugar in the last act of this film and mired his own film in unnecessary, cheesy sentiment.  \\"AKA Black Mamba, AKA Mommy\\"?  Give me a break!  Also, the relationship between The Bride and BB works just fine without the lovey-dovey last scene, which seems to serve no narrative function.  Or, maybe this last scene is doomed because the climactic showdown right before it is non-existent.  You don't set up a great character like Bill and have him go down in a whimper.  Tarantino has done this kind of ending before in Pulp Fiction, where the focus is on dialogue and acting rather than physical confrontation, but here, he's working within the confines and expectations of a martial-arts film.  No martial-arts film, even a Quentin Tarantino one, should leave the audience hanging by giving a dizzyingly unsatisfying 20-second climactic showdown.  If Tarantino had nixed that useless Esteban Vihaio sequence, he could have bought himself eight, 10 minutes to actually work out Bill and The Bride's final confrontation. <br /> <br />I've had this DVD for over two weeks now and put it into my player about a dozen times.  After the first time I tried to rewatch the whole thing (and nearly dozed off), I just started perusing only the best scenes, which at their best are just fantastic:  The Pai Mei training; the superbly funny Elle Driver monologue and the subsequent trailer fight; Bill's pre-climactic scenes with BB and The Bride; and the wonderful, trademark-Tarantino \\"Lisa Wong's assassin\\" confrontation scene.  Everything in between, unfortunately, was so dependent on not knowing what's about to happen that when you've seen it once, you will never want to see it again. <br /> <br />Is this DVD worth owning?  Yes, just for the delicious highlights -- just watching Daryl Hannah and David Carradine steal the scenes is enough.  But be prepared for an erratic ride that will lose steam as you take it a second or third time, and keep your finger on the chapter-skip button, because at the end of the day, Kill Bill Vol. 2 really is a mix between half a fantastic movie and half a cheesy, overlong dud. <br />
B00007ELEL|5.0|Over 3000 years of beautiful tradition: from Moses to Sandy Koufax. This would be a great series of movies. Kind of like Cheech and Chong and mystery movie thing going on.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|I rented this movie based on its Oscar recognition, and because I love epic historic stories. My husband and I sat through it hoping that the near-constant scenes of tragedy, brutality and lewdness would be somehow softened by a satisfactory ending... but the last five minutes of the movie dashed those hopes and made the previous 2 1/2 hours a total waste of time.<br /><br />There were moments of humor and tenderness. But the main focus of the movie is not what happens to the characters. The main focus is to drive home to the viewers the tragedy, futility and brutality of war. And the movie's creators drive it home... over... and over.. and over... and over and over again. There is an excellently portrayed battle scene at the beginning which makes that point very well, and they could have then focused on actually telling a fulfilling story, but they didn't.<br /><br />And considering the extremely explicit sex scenes, I can't fathom why this movie wasn't rated NC-17.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I disagree that this flick caters to the ultra left. It raises some doubt for any and all americans that are honestly seeking the truth.  <br /> <br /> <br />You are shown war the way it is not the way the media, hollywood, and Bush would like you to think it is. It lends more weight to the voluntary war that Bush plunged the US in on fauly evidence.  <br /> <br /> <br />You don't have to be a democrat to acknowledge that the war in Iraq is a mistake and the movie doesn't do anything but rightfully question the intelligence of the man that sent the US there and the connections of the administration with shady figures.  <br /> <br /> <br />The beginning has some interesting things to say about Florida and the 2000 election. The middle deals with Bush's incompetence and the manipulation of 9/11 to scare the public. The final set piece shows the horror and tragedy of war for all involved....except the contractors that are making billions.  <br /> <br /> <br />Great movie for any american.
B000002UAU|5.0|There is nothing I can tell you about Sgt. Pepper that you have not already heard. After this album dropped, rock and roll never sounded the same again. From what I have heard and read, this was one of the first records of consequence in the world. If you haven't heard this then it's time...and if you haven't found the Beatles yet then this is a great place to start. From that very first obscure violin note to the very last trombone in A Day in the Life this record is pure magic. Sgt. Pepper makes me feel lucky to be alive and proves that the Beatles are truly the greatest of all time, end of story.
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is a true standout amongst so many others. If their second album is as hot as this one, they're going to be around for a long time. This is the kind of CD that you're not afraid to put in your stereo and turn up the volume. I love the mixture of Rock, Pop, R&B, and Jazz.

B0002TT0NW|4.0|Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, it was great, but it wasn't close to the book at all! There were some part that were in the book, but not very many. I'm a huge fan of the books and movies and I would never say anything bad about them, but I was upset that a lot of stuff from the book wasn't in the movie. If you haven't seen the movie, I suggest that you go see it sometime and see for yourself. It's a great movie and I would highly recommend it.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|A lot of people don't like this movie because it does not follow the game time line... However the makers of this movie did not get full copyrights in the first place. So given what they had to work with, Resident Evil pulls off as a fun, action paced horror flick, that uses it's metallic look and sound to it's advantage, the actor's performance, and special affects to please the makers of the videogame series. It might of not of pleased all fans but it sure hooked me onto the Resident Evil franchise. I never played the games before seeing the movie and now I own all of them. With the success of the first one, the copyrights are now in full, and those die hard fans can stop complaining about the lack of relevance to the videogame series. But if you watch the first movie.. there are a lot of little things that relate to the game.. A LOT.
B00015HVI8|1.0|The character of Jonas Quinn joins the crew of SG-1 for one mercifully short season. He's a man of many talents: He can hold his breath a really, really long time; he has an incredible ability to read and memorize a lot of books; he smiles a lot; and he can put a viewer into a light doze in absolutely record time. I still can't fathom why the showrunners decided to introduce an alien character who looks and acts no more alien than a Kansas-born farmboy. It was a genuine relief to get Dr. Daniel Jackson back. Thank heavens they finally listened to the fan outcry! <br />
B000002LCD|4.0|Although this soundtrack has a spotty lineup, I liked the Madonna songs on it.  I didn't get this album until the summer of 1989.  But I played it a lot that summer.  My favorite song on here is Madonna's \\"The Look of Love.\\" I like the somber mood of the song and the keyboards playing on it.  It should have been on her 1986 \\"True Blue\\" album--sounds like a slower version of the fast paced White Heat on there.   But I like the hits of Who's That Girl and Causing a Commotion.  Club Nouveau's '87 offering following that mega '86 album success is just as good.  The others are mainly dance numbers that want to sound like Madonna's songs.  Didn't like the movie--it was a stinker big time--I felt that Madonna should have sticked to music, which she's very good at to this day.  The soundtrack more than makes up for that summer '87 box office bomb.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Wow---It is tough to convey exactly how incredible this film is amid all of the media debate concerning its \\"controversial\\" nature.  In my humble opinion, there was nothing controversial about it at all.  For the most part, this is a film for believers.  While there might be non-christians who appreciate the film in an artistic sense, for the most part it is a film that will appeal primarily to christians.  It seems to me that everyone who decried the film as numbingly violent and anti-semitic just plain old miss the point...Gibson's aim was to make Christ's suffering more real, and visceral.  While the gospels of Matthew and Mark are pretty specific as to the details of Christ's crucifixion, actually \\"witnessing\\" it as Gibson's film allows us to do, gives one a greater appreciation for what he endured.  That is the whole point of the film...to give you an eyewitness point-of-view.  Contrary to many critics' assertions, the film matched up pretty well with my Bible.  Gibson does take some artistic license, but not much...He does not deviate too far from Biblical accounts.  Although it is difficult to watch, it is beautifully shot, and the original score perfectly complements the film and its message.  Jim Caviezel, in particular, delivers a stunningly emotional performance in spite of sparse dialogue.  In the end, it isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea.  I suspect there won't be much middle ground...You either understand its message and LOVE the film, or you do not, and you loathe it.  It moved me in a way no other film ever has or could.
B00000K2UX|1.0|This isn't about the updated version, but about the original 1986 album that I heard in 1994.  While I liked Kenny Loggins \\"Danger Zone\\" and its loud rock guitars and Berlin\\"s \\"Take my Breath Away\\" (which Jessica Simpson remade in 2004--Jessica, I liked your version, but it's no contest to Berlin's original), the rest of the album is complete JUNK! It mostly sounds like a Madonna album to me, some of her fun dance pop.  Did the people who made this album say \\"Okay, let's copy some stuff or parts of Madonna's True Blue album (which came out at around the same time in '86)and make an album out of it?\\" Marietta's song sounds so much like Madonna's Into The Groove from '85.  It sold all those millions of albums the same year that Tom Cruise's movie was a hit in '86. Yet a lot of this stuff isn't that good. Only Kenny Loggins, Berlin and the Loverboy power ballad are the best songs. The other 7 songs from the original 10-song album from 1986 are just lousy. Even the Greene song and Cheap Trick song sound EXACTLY like Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone with the charged up rock guitars--too many similarities.  Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine don't sound good at all here with her song--her other songs are far better than this.  And Kenny Loggins' Playing With the Boys copies his '84 hit Footloose way too much.  But the shoddy rock and the blatant copying of Madonna's dance formula are all too obvious on this album.  One of the worst soundtrack albums I've ever heard! They flew Air Force jets over this lame music in that movie?!  Even Madonna wouldn't have liked this album either!

Anne tried to clear her mind of all the problems and difficulties, by writing in her diary as if \\"kitty\\" was a friend<br /><br />In that Annex, Anne Frank wrote in her own words the holocaust that she was passing through without being captured, her diary was the only friend  she had to express the anguish and fear that the whole family was feeling, knowing that the Germans could find them anytime.<br />They lived there with a lot of deficiences, but mainly with a lot of indignity and fear,until in 1944 the Germans found the secret annex and Anne and her family were sent to the concentration camps, where she died.  The diary was found in the Annex, and in 1947 it was published so that everyone can know what was the terrible truth of the Holocaust, said by the words of a little Jewish girl.
B00000JCOV|4.0|A friend of mine introduced Slipknot to me back in '99. At the time, I never really listened to heavy metal, but I was curious as to what these freaks had to offer. Now, this was something new to my ears. Fast, angry, and brutal loud music. Never had I heard anything like this. <br /> <br />\\"Spit It Out\\" was the first track I heard off this album. Ever since hearing it I decided to buy the album. And I was just in awe. Slipknot has introduced me to heavy metal. And I became a maggot. <br /> <br />At that time, I thought Slipknot was the greatest thing to happen. I bought merchandise (shirts, posters, etc.) and I listened to this album regularly. The songs were excellent. Sick and twisted lyrics, Corey screaming violently, and the other members playing relentlessly. Even though I liked just about every song, \\"Purity\\" was by far my favorite Slipknot track (and I still think so to this day) but I'm so disappointed that later releases of this album cut that track out (along with \\"Frail Limb Nursery\\") with a different so-so track in their places. <br /> <br />Over the years, my Slipknot obsession gradually began to wear off. I was 14 when I was a \\"true\\" maggot, now I'm a 19 year old bum that appreciates other bands like the Doors and the Beatles. But once in a while, I stick this album on and still get amazed by it. It's now what I classify as just a very good album.  <br /> <br />But as I think about my experiences with Slipknot, I think this is a good band for the younger crowd to listen to. Kids can be in awe when they see these guys with ther masks. They'll think it's \\"cool.\\" Now, the only reason I say this is because then kids will want to explore outside the Slipknot box. They'll wanna find another band that's similar to Slipknot (music wise). And that's what happened with me. I found better, more brutal bands than Slipknot like Slayer, Pantera, Megadeath, Judas Priest, '80s Metallica, Dimmu Borgir, etc.  <br /> <br />Sure, Slipknot may be just a nu-metal band, butas time passes, the \\"nu-metal fan\\" will eventually find the good heavy metal music. Just look at past reviews of this album...
0517201658|5.0|Meggie loses everything she loves, the theme runs throughout the novel.   <br /> <br />Beautifully written, pictures painted by McCullough will stay in your mind.   <br /> <br />Someone told me this was based on a true story, I certainly hope not.   <br /> <br />Meggie lives her life loving a man who won't give up his ambition to be with her.  She matures and gains wisdom as time passes, Ralph stays ambitious and blind to real life.   <br /> <br />It's a very sad story but beautiful and the ending is bittersweet.
B00005OM4N|4.0|One can't deny how Britney has matured (at the time). Britney was moving in the right direction with this album. She was showing the world that she's a girl on the road developing into a young and mature woman. Sure, the sound is still typical teen pop, but the lyrics have a sense of maturity (in some tracks, that is). The cover song \\"I Love Rock N'Roll\\" is fairly good for a pop track. \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" is a brilliant ballad showing Britney becoming mature. And the album comprises of mostly club dance music, but it's a hell of a lot better than what was on \\"In the Zone.\\" \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"Lonely,\\" and \\"Boys\\" a just a few highlights on this album. <br /> <br />Like I said before, Britney was heading in the right direction with this album. And like most self-titled albums, it shows maturity. But then she decides to be like Madonna and head into a totally wrong direction with her \\"In the Zone\\" album. <br /> <br />Also, I can't help but think she and the producers of this album ripped off the Middle Eastern sounds of Mandy Moore's self-titled album... <br /> <br />Overall, I give this album 4/5 stars. A bit of senseless dance/pop tracks, but most of them have better developed lyrics.
B000007R1E|5.0|Seventh Sojourn has always been my favorite Moody Blues release and now it's in DTS Surround!! This is an incredibly natural, stunning, phenomenal mix. The beauty of the music flows around you. I can't possibly say any more, you have to experience it. They could not have made a better choice for their first DTS release (along with Days Of Future Passed). Now if they'd only format the rest of their catalog in DTS (or DVD-Audio)!!<br /><br />This is also available on SACD which sounds even better!!
B00004W221|5.0|My favorite movie of all time. In addition to the film, I own a copy of the soundtrack and it makes me REALLLLY mad when other films use the music. It's like stealing. My favorite moment of the movie is when the captain of the team asks Rudy if he's ready to lead the team thru the Notre Dame tunnel out on to the field. And he says, \\"I've been ready for this my whole life.\\" If you don't cry, then and there, you need CPR. The guy from WVA who called it drivel, well, I'll bet you got cut from your high school team and haven't been the same since. Don't be bitter.
B00005JMX6|4.0|Without a doubt, this film pays homage to \\"Risky Business\\" and succeeds on every level in matching the feel and quality of that film. I expected the usual teen Hollywood schlock and was very, very pleasantly surprised.
B0002IU988|4.0|scott stapp's vocals just grated at my nerves, so i was glad to hear that the musicians in creed cut him loose, as they really know how to jam.myles kenendy is a much more meoldic singer, and has a much smoother delivery.\\"find the real\\" is a great rock song with a punch, while \\"one day remains\\"-the guitar is jsut all over the place but a fun listen.\\"open your eyes\\" is an amazing song-brilliant single which displays myles' great vocal range.\\"metalingus\\" has an amazingly heavy intro, with \\"burn it down\\" being a great ballad in the middle of the album.im glad \\"the end is here\\" isnt a mellowed out garbage song, as they rock out at the end which was great to hear.sometimes, it drags along towards the latter of the disc, but noetheless, a solid debut from a band with a much bigger ceiling than what they had before.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|'A Valid Path' has been a long time coming. If the highlights for you, as they are for me, of previous Alan Parsons Project/Alan Parsons albums are the instrumental tracks, and you don't mind a more electronica beat, this album is for you! Only four of the nine tracks have lyrics, and one of those is a punched up amalgamation of 'A Dream Within a Dream' and 'The Raven' from the very first Project album, 'Tales of Mystery and Imagination - Edgar Allan Poe'. In fact, another track is an update of 'Eye in the Sky's instrumental, 'Mammagamma'. But the collaborations with everyone from Pink Floyd's David Gilmour to The Crystal Method to Alan's son Jeremy, keep 'A Valid Path' interesting throughout, sometimes moody and atmospheric, sometimes bouncy and very dancable! In fact, with a little push and no prejudice against the veteran prog/pop rocker, there are several potential club hits on this album. For me, the only weak point is 'More Lost Without You', but at 3:20, it's the shortest track on an album with tunes ranging up to almost nine minutes in length, so it's no big deal. And despite being a big instrumental fan, I find 'We Play the Game', with vocals by Alan himself, to be one of the albums major highlights. In short, if you're an old rocker who wants nothing but the same old, same old, this album is not for you. But if you like to see the artists you like progressing into different, if very appropriate, realms, while still maintaining the quality you've come to expect of them, then 'A Valid Path' will be a very welcome addition to your collection.

B000244EMO|4.0|Now this is what a well-made, stylish action film should be. It's not quite a classic---it has a RAMBO-like opening action sequence that I personally could have done without---but this 1987 film is undoubtedly one of the better films of the action genre, one tinged with a sci-fi angle that provides slight novelty to what is pretty much a gruesome version of \\"Ten Little Indians\\" in a Central American jungle.    PREDATOR was directed by John McTiernan, who would expand his popularity as an action director in the following year with the release of the wildly successful DIE HARD. McTiernan could show some of the younger hotshot action directors today how to really craft great action. With both PREDATOR and DIE HARD, he proves that great Hollywood entertainment doesn't have to be simply brainless or crude. In both those films, McTiernan brings energy, wit, and even an eye for beautifully composed images to considerably liven up a potentially routine action thriller. PREDATOR definitely benefits from some terrific jungle scenery and cinematography (by Donald McAlpine); despite its high body count and gruesome gore, the film almost always looks beautiful (which is more than one can say about the action thrillers of younger directors like Michael Bay or Renny Harlin). In a way, McTiernan is a more refined action director than most, emphasizing slick craftsmanship over sheer heart-stopping excitement; but, in the case of this film and DIE HARD, his refinement never dilutes the excitement of the action scenes (which flow beautifully from one scene to another here).    The special visual and aural effects of this film still look and sound top-notch today. Stan Winston's conception of the alien creature is still dazzling (and grotesque) to look at, and the sound effects are always convincingly atmospheric. PREDATOR also benefits from a terrific orchestral score by Alan Silvestri, sounding especially muscular on the film soundtrack on this special edition DVD. (Trevor Jones musthave been somewhat influenced by it when he scored Renny Harlin's CLIFFHANGER in 1993.)    As for Arnold Schwarzenegger (oops, sorry; GOVERNOR Arnold Schwarzenegger), well...once again he proves himself to be a pretty good action hero, with certainly the physique to be one as well as a decent way with a cheesy one-liner (although he only has about three of them in this movie, certainly a lot less than he did in COMMANDO or RAW DEAL). The former Mr. Universe had not, by this film, shown the charisma and likable self-mockery he was to display in later action films and comedies; despite that, PREDATOR remains one of his better films (and a vast improvement over the laughable RAW DEAL).     In sum, if you're looking for action fireworks, PREDATOR will fit the bill quite nicely. Director John McTiernan brings a welcome amount of class to the picture, bringing wit and style and even an acute sense of beautiful imagery to what would be merely a crude gorefest in lesser hands. Overall, the picture is a fast-paced (apart from a slow beginning), suspenseful, exciting action ride with a final showdown between good and evil that rivals with the best final showdowns of the action genre. Recommended.
B00028HBKM|4.0|This movie tends to push it a little far in terms of violence. I feel I have a strong stomach and at times was still like \\"whoa\\". I guess you could argue that the events the movie is about were indeed violent, so its justified. It all just seemed a little much and a little unnecessary.      On a good note though, the realism of the movie is fantastic. There was practically nothing in the movie that wouldn't be mistaken for real. The make-up, special effects, and biblical accuracy of the dialogue should be applauded. It seems to be the most honest attempt to create an untainted or biased retelling of the events of Christ's end.      The entire dialogue of the film is presented in text at the bottom of the screen, so unless you understand Hebrew (at least I think its Hebrew), be prepared to read everything. While this does add to the realism, it almost takes away from the viewing because you spend the entire story reading sub-titles and for me, my eyes were constantly shifting back and forth between screenplay and sub-titles. So while the language would have been pleasing at times like for instance, when Christ has been crucified and he's talking to God, but I found it to be another distraction from the story, much like the extremely graphic violence.      Overall I think this is a film that should be seen. I probably couldn't see myself watching this again and again. It was a lot to take in and won't fade from memory anytime soon. In the end I would say this is a well-made movie, and accurate as far as I know, however the continuous violence gets old after a while and the sub-titles do as well. 4 Stars.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|This is a truly awesome movie. For those of us who grew up reading the classic science fiction of the masters of the field such as Robert Heinlein and John Campbell, Jr., this movie is like coming home. Overly melodramatic? Possibly. Extremely patriotic and 'human-centric'? Guilty as charged. None of this changes the fact that this is one heckuva great action movie. I've seen reviews that ran this movie down because it was too biased; personally I like the concept that the human spirit will trimuph against all odds. If you don't agree, go back to your planet and leave us earthlings to ourselves.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I Love Sarah!  <br />But I don't understand why she didn't incorporate her recent personal experiences into her songs, they are still fresh in her mind and she can still fathom the emotions. Why? It would make perfect art.  <br />You can write the retrospective reflective poems/songs later!  <br /> <br />I mean such deep hurtful and transcending experiences of losing your mother, and the birth of your baby, marital bliss -they coukd make fantastic and emotional songs.  <br /> <br />But I'll wait patiently for her next collection with songs on those experiences... but still I am not disappointed at the album. It's similar to both \\"Fumbling towards ecstacy\\" and \\"Surfacing\\". But it still doesn't match the brilliance of either of them. I was inspired by \\"Fallen\\", the satirical and Celtic \\"World on Fire\\", the unconditional love (of a partner or parent) \\"Push\\", the \\"Angel\\" copy of \\"Answer\\", the poetic \\"Time\\", and the retrospective \\"Perfect Girl\\". Some of the lame songs were \\"Drifting\\" and \\"Train Wreck\\".  <br /> <br />Go Sarah! I hope you continue recording and writing and please let us have another album in 2-3 yrs time.
B00009ATIX|4.0|For those of you who have read other reviews let me add something I think people are missing about this movie. <br />The female scietist on board is right, if she was ugly you would not want her therefore she is pretty, ect. <br /> the copies seem to be made to seduce or want the humans to like them. The first copy of George Clooney's wife appears to be an exact duplicate of her, still loving him and wanting to sit next to him. He cannot deal with her like that and sends her into space. <br /> The second copy of her however has a completely different personality and viewpoint, not sure who she is, how she got there and is not sure if she can deal with it. (right down Clooneys alley as he is a psycologist). <br /> Now he seems attracted to the second one and wants her no matter what. <br /> the movie is slow paced but that didn't bother me, it seems to be a story of second chances or as close to a second chance as you can get..if you see the movie in this light it is a nice love story with a happy ending - solaris style. <br /> This movie accomplished, although in a different way, what everyone wants to see in every movie - a happy ending.
B00005JMUA|1.0|What a waste of my time (and money)!<br /><br />I LOVED Volume I and couldn't wait to see Volume II.<br /><br />What a HUGE disappointment!<br /><br />I'm a HUGE Tarantino fan, Uma fan, Madsen fan, Woods fan, and this just SUCKED.<br /><br />If Kill Bill had been released as one movie, as originally written and produced, I would have walked out of the theatre.<br /><br />All the excitment and choreography in Volume I built up the story line and energy, only to be let down like a thud of rocks in Volume II.<br /><br />What a let down!

B00003CXS4|2.0|Okay, I'll admit that Brad Pitt was amusing and I liked the fact that the Dvd had subtitles just for him. The story was all over the place and the accents made the dialogue very hard to follow. I liked some of the editing and humor, but as a whole I wasn't that impressed. I'm sure glad I saw this one for free.
078322933X|3.0|You just know when you see photo booth snaps of Nicole and David (Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg) kissing and snuggling cleverly juxtaposed with David's jailhouse mugshot on his bedroom wall...this won't be a cinematic enigma wrapped in a riddle.  Fear certainly doesn't require much thought on the part of the moviegoer. <br /> <br />But it isn't entirely bad though, if you are prepared for predictable teen angst and psycho boyfriend antics.  Reese Witherspoon plays the virgin nymphet Nicole Walker, desperately pining for brooding bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks David McCall, deliciously played by Mark Wahlberg.  With the help of \\"gets around\\" pal Margo (Alyssa Milano), Nicole soon begins to develop a close bond with David, and (surprise surprise) even loses her virginity to him. <br /> <br />But of course, no such plot would be complete without the overprotective father, played by CSI's William Petersen.  Suspicious of his daughter's new boyfriend from the start, he forbodes their relationship from the very beginning.  That's when things go \\"psycho\\"... <br /> <br />David quickly begins to sport the crazy-serious-insane-obssessed face whenever any other guy goes near Nicole or when her father tries to keep them apart.  Where does this get everyone?  In a whole mess of unbelievable trouble that will leave the moviewatcher saying \\"hello?  this would never happen!\\" while watching the movie through their hands.   <br /> <br />All in all, not a terrible flick.  The ending definitely could have had better closure, but you can't expect too too much given the corny plot.  Oh, and of course, you get to see Mark Wahlberg without his shirt on.  That, in itself, makes the movie worth at least one look.  :)
B00005JNEI|5.0|You can say what you want about Michael Moore's bias, but the most damaging elements of the film are footage of George W. Bush himself.  The statement \\"Some call you the elite.  I call you my base\\" is an incredibly telling comment.  And Haliburton employees at their sales meeting crowing that its going to be a very good year for them (and then try to back pedal, saying \\"Oh, but bad for our soldiers.\\") tells you all you need to know about the realities of Iraq.  Michael Moore simply can't make up better stuff than this!<br /><br />It always surprises me when the common man is duped into believing this administration is doing right by him, despite all evidence to the contrary. That man will never see this film, let alone with the proper air of scepticism and curiousity.  And we'll all pay for that as the tax base gets shifted to the middle class, our health costs escalate and our boys go to war.  We watch helplessly as our tax dollars are delivered and without accountability to defense contractors and oil companies.<br /><br />And that really is the theme of Farenheit 911.  Watch it if you're willing to give it some thought.  If your mind is made up, just watch Fox News and they'll tell you everything the government wants you to know.
B000002VSN|5.0|This album is THEE very best Whitney has ever done...her voice is undeniably impeccable on every song...  I don't think every single song has the same caliber of greatness...but her voice..that range...those tones...come through beautifully on every track.  This album most certainly solidifies Whitney as one of the greatest pop vocalists in a very...very long time.  The songs...and the way she works them sets her apart from all the rest...and again...I just cannot tire of listening to this CD.  Any person who appreciates a fine tuned voice, a most incredible talent...a truly skilled musician...will appreciate listening to Whitney do 'her stuff'.  Get the CD...get ready to enjoy!
B00003CXCT|3.0|This version of the trilogy is based on the 1997 version. I give it only three stars because the originals from 1977, 1980, and 1983 are not being made available on DVD.<br /><br />George Lucas should be able to change his films however he wants to, but why keep the originals away from those who really want them? Steven Spielberg released both the 1982 version and the 2002 version of E.T. on DVD. James Cameron did the same by releasing both the originals and Special Editions of The Abyss, Aliens, and Terminator 2. Why can't George? I think even a Limited Edition run of the originals would satisfy most Star Wars purists. C'mon!<br /><br />I admit that I'll be right there buying the new DVDs, but for the fans' sake... for film history's sake, I hope the original versions that I saw and fell in love with will be made available on DVD to the public. These films made Mr. Lucas what he is today and should get the respect they deserve!

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I'll start my review by saying to all of those hardcore(not the genre but adjective) metal fan that only like kinda bands like dimmu borgir... f**k A7X never asked to be like those. Avenged Sevenfold is a gothic metal band not a black metal one. ok the review now. Matt Shadows is simply amazing he can reach extremely high pitch screams as much as he can reach those really low growls and same thing for when he sings normally he has this fantastic voice that just pulls u in the atmosphere of Waking the Fallen and let's not forget our litle friend Sinister Gates(lead guitar) this guy is amazing he's probably the best guitar player of the last ten years. He's so young (around 19) and look at what he can do it,s simply stoking. This band is in the right way if they continue to evolve they'll be flying high like metalica so anyways see ya all A7 fans
B0002858YS|4.0|I heard \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on Fuse and instantly knew this band needed a thorough listen. Their stlye was 80's, but with a fresh twist. They didn't sound like the other bands riding this retro revolution. I really enjoyed the synth lines in \\"On Top\\" and \\"Mr.Brightside\\". \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is a great pop-rock song with good synth lines as well. Songs that wern't so hot were \\"Andy Your a Star\\" and \\"Midnightnight Show\\". \\"Andy\\" sounded too metal in the instuments and too pop in the vocals, and Midnight Show was... well I don't know what it was, but I didnt't like it. <br />This is my first review but I've spun this album front to back and It's an awesome Cd to play on day when you want to listen to something really birght and fun. All in all a great everyday listen
B000021Y7X|5.0|More often than not, concert videos fall into one of two categories; The first is that it is only a concert. The group gets up and plays their songs and eventually they stop and the show ends. The second is where the group tries to expand into the realm of visual arts and they experiment by placing plugged in videos, out-takes or behind the stage scenes into the recording. <br /> <br />Stop Making Sense successfully combines both a musical statement and a visual art statement together and produces a show that stands the test of time. If you don't like the Talking Heads music, you can enjoy the visual aspect or if you like their music and don't care a hoot about the visual you can just enjoy the music. Hopefully you can combine the two and enjoy one hell of a show!
0452282152|5.0|\\"My mother did not tell me they were coming. Afterwards she said she did not want me to appear nervous. I was surprised, for I thought she knew me well. Strangers would think I was calm. I did not cry as a baby. Only my mother would note the tightness along my jaw, the widening of my already wide eyes.\\" <br /> <br /> Thus begins Girl With a Pearl Earring, a pulsing, vivid exploration of the tensely serene world of Vemeer. Vermeer was one of Dutch's finest artists, his1600's composition of Girl With a Pearl Earring being his most notable piece of art. The fascination with him arises from a piece of art that inspires awe similar to the Mona Lisa-Our lack of knowledge of this woman he so poignantly painted leaves a story waiting to be unraveled. <br /> <br />Tracy Chevalier finds a way to tell this story, as difficult or obscure as the facts may be. She illustrates the character of Griet as a clever, headstrong girl thrown into tragic circumstances. Her father, once a master tile maker, is blinded by an exploding kiln, leaving Griet's family desolate. Griet has no choice but to find work, and when her mother hears of the painter Vermeer searching for a maid to clean his studio, she offers her daughter for the job. Before long, Griet finds herself caught up in the world of \\"Papist's Corner\\", as well as Vermeer's artistic dimension. Without thinking of the consequences, she becomes an apprentice in his artistic pursuits, all the while warding off advances of Vermeer's most frequent patron, van Ruijven. The final disaster in the already tense family situation occurs when Vermeer, transfixed by Griet's simple beauty, decides to paint her.  <br /> <br />The qualities that make this book a gem are found not only in its vivid descriptions and realistic development of each of its characters, but the way in which each relationship is gently spun into a delicate, precise web of conflicting emotion. The relationship between Griet and Vermeer is the most beautiful of all these relationships. There is trust, friendship, sexual tension, and yes, perhaps even love, but mostly, it is Vermeer's fascination with Griet's artistic sense that constantly draws him to her: \\"Soon it became easier to keep my eyes on his. He looked at me as if he were not seeing me, but someone else, or something else-as if her were looking at a painting.\\" <br /> <br />Girl With a Pearl Earring is virtually flawless. It tells a sad story of an unspoken love and understanding between two people who would never come to be together. Indeed, by the end of the novel, Griet finds herself amidst a family disaster, one that can only have a sorrowful conclusion for Vermeer and his apprentice. However, the love and memories that still exist in Griet's mind, as well as the masterpiece painting left behind, are surely enough for any reader to be left stunned by this excellent work of fiction.
B000002JB3|4.0|\\"There's no drum machine on this one!!\\" is what Phil Collins put in the liner notes on his sixth studio album from 1996 - \\"Dance Into The Light\\".   This was an obvious reference to the criticism he drew on his previous studio album \\"Both Sides\\" in which he played all of the instruments by himself and used a drum machine.   But it was more than that - on \\"Both Sides\\" he abandoned much of the formula that made brought him great success during the 1980s.   The quote by Phil shows that his sense of humor has returned - something that was sorely missing on the \\"Both Sides\\" album.   Not only is Phil's humor back, but so are some of the things that made Phil successful.   As always, Phil Collins will do some new things - so it isn't a complete reversal back to the old days. <br /> <br />\\"Dance Into The Light\\" does look a little different from the looks of the album.   This is the first studio album done by Phil that doesn't  have a full head shot across the cover.  Phil's previous 5 studio albums all featured a full head shot on either a dark or dreary type of background.  On this CD, this features a full body shot of Phil \\"dancing\\" on a very bright orange background.   Instead of his name being off in the corner or close to the edge, it is written directly across in big \\"Phil Collins handwriting\\" script.   The title of the album is not in Phil Collins script (first time on a studio album).  Finally, this is Phil's first album to be directly named for a song (\\"Both Sides\\" was a take of the song \\"Both Sides of the Story\\"). <br /> <br />Musically - before \\"Both Sides\\", the formula for Phil's solo career was pretty simple:  1) The integration horns into many of the songs; 2) The Thundering, Haunting Drums of Phil Collins  (i.e. \\"In the Air Tonight Style) with an infusion of keyboards (and guitar on \\"No Jacket Required\\" and \\"...But Seriously).   3) The Use of a Solid Supporting Band.   On the first two albums he did there also was a\\"dark psychedelic\\" element.    For \\"Both Sides\\" this formula was completely abandoned.   On \\"Dance Into The Light\\",  Phil brings the horns back.   It is not the Phenix Horns, but now Vine St. Horns (led by Serious Tour trumpeteer Harry Kim).    Phil brings back a solid studio band.   Daryl Stuermer returns on lead guitar.   Gone is Leland Sklar, the long bearded and very talented bassist.  Nathan East takes Sklar's place.   Another significant member is background vocalist Arnold McCuller (also an alumnus of the Serious Tour).   The haunting drums aren't quite as visible as on previous albums.   The song \\"Oughta Know By Now\\" has the trademark Thundering, Haunting Drums of Phil.   Phil still has a presence for drums, but will now do it in different ways - most notably an African style percussion that can be heard on \\"Lorenzo\\" and \\"River So Wide\\".   Overall, I think there is a stronger influence toward the keyboards than to the guitar (similar to his first two albums).  Finally, on \\"...But Seriously\\", Phil put a \\"serious\\" element into his music (while having fun).   On \\"Both Sides\\", that continued (without the fun).  Now on \\"Dance Into the Light\\", the serious element remains (and the fun is back). <br /> <br />The title track is the first song on the album.   We can immediately hear Phil go back to his roots with the sound of the Vine Street Horns. While \\"Dance Into The Light\\" is a nice song, it isn't one of Phil's best.  I think it is one of his weaker songs he has done.   Perhaps the only reason why the album got titled after this song is the \\"brighter\\" outlook this album brings compared to previous ones.    The horns are alive in well on the song \\"Wear My Hat\\".  This song has become a favorite in recent years when done live.  The song has almost a \\"comedic skit like\\" element and is a lot of fun to listen to.   Another solid song that features horns and a \\"skit like element\\" (a little less comedic) is the song \\"Take Me Down\\".  The horns also turn up on \\"It's in Your Eyes\\" - this is another good song that got some airplay on radio.  Finally the song \\"Oughta Know By Now\\" - this song really has the \\"Classic Phil\\" element - the thundering drums, an R&B feel,  good guitar and keyboards, and of course - the horns. <br /> <br />Phil still has his \\"serious\\" side.  He co-wrote a song called \\"Lorenzo\\" with the late Michaela Odone.  This song was inspired by the movie \\"Lorenzo's Oil\\" in which Odone tried to find a cure for her son's rare disease.  This has some great African drums as does the song \\"River So Wide\\" (not as serious but both songs are good).   Another \\"serious\\" song is \\"Just Another Story\\" - basically a song about \\"going too far\\" when doing something that is wrong.   <br /> <br />Phil also does a remake of the Bob Dylan classic \\"The Times They Are A-Changin\\".  This is a terrific cover by Phil.  It stars slow, but then builds up and slowly integrates the other instruments (including bagpipes played by Phil).  Phil does a better version than Bob Dylan and it is the perfect wrap-up to this collection.   It is almost prophetic on what would happen with Phil's future in the music business. <br /> <br />The colleciton features lyrics and musician credits for each song.  Phil doesn't include any one line quotes like he did on \\"Both Sides\\".   This album should help keep the core fans happy, but the changes in the music industry (namely rise of \\"alternative music\\") hurt Phil and as a result this album didn't sell as well as it should have.  However, this album shouldn't be ignored.  While not the homerun of his first 4 albums, it is still very good.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Ressurecting an enterprise (I use this word instead of franchise for obvious reasons) often proves to be exceedingly difficult. Typically it can only be done when everything is perfect and in sync with everything else. Inthis sense Star Trek the Motion Picture is different. It is not a perfect movie just as the Enterprise was not in perfect working condition when it was launched. <br />Starfleet identifies a large nebulous cloud that sucks up everything that comes near it and it is up to guess who to inveestigate and stop it. Getting guess who proves to be more of a challenge than it should be, both for the movie producers and for Admiral Kirk. Spock is the coldest he has ever been and the doctor was busy growing a beard and living it up. The current captain of the Enterprise is very reluctant to relinquish command to Kirk, whom he views as a wash-out with no recent experience. Eventually the Enterprise meets and becomes imprisoned inside of the nebulous cloud which turns out to be a massive robotic starship named V'Ger that is headed toward Earth to be United with its creator. <br />The movie has a feel very similar to 2001: A Space Oddyssey. There are numerous shots which look like they could be taken straight out of the movie, including a journey down a CGI wormhole and the inside of V'Ger. Because the director of this movie was so clearly influenced by the Kubrick, the movie became much longer than it had to be. It took almost anhour for the Enterprise to actually leave the spacedock and for the story to actually get moving. Even when the story got moving the movie would slow down for extended shots of many things which further slowed the plot. Had this been an episode of the original series the plot could have been compressed to one or two episodes. <br />All in all the length was not a bad thing. The visuals were pretty remarkable for 1979, not quite as good as some of the scenes from Star Wars but often far more interesting. The plot was however extremely predictable after watching a few episodes of the original series in shoudl become clear to you half way through the movie what will happen and how it will happen. For example Spock's 'surprise' visit to the ship was the farthest thing from a surprise.  <br />The film is recommended for those who loved 2001: A Space Oddessey and for those who can't get enough of Star Trek, but typically the latter already own this movie.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Garage Inc.(1998). Metallica's Eighth Album. A Collection of EP's, B-Sides, Rare songs, and Original Material.<br /><br />In 1991, Metallica entered the mainstream with their #1 smash hit 'Metallica', which forever blessed and haunted them. Throughout the 90's, Metallica tried hard to live up to that album, but 'Load' and 'Reload' were often criticized and Metallica further angered their fans by sueing Napster. Although 'I Disappear' was the track that got Napster sued, another thing that caused them to do that was because of the massive downloading of the 'Garage Days Revisited' and 'Garage Days Re-Revisited' EP's, not to mention various singles. In an effort to stop the downloading, Metallica combined their EP's with rare songs, not to mention a full-disc worth of new material that comprised 'Garage Inc.'. In the album, Metallica is found covering the bands that influenced them the most, bands who played the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Speed Metal, Southern Rock, and Punk. Unsurprisingly, 'Garage Inc' debuted in the Billboard Top 5, and easily sold over a million copies within its first 6 months, even receiving two Grammy's and spawning the massive hits \\"Whiskey In The Jar\\" and \\"Turn The Page\\". In an effort to gain more fans and get their fans to like some of their favorite bands, did Metallica succeed in this effort or just flat out embarass themselves like on 'St. Anger'? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />On 'Garage Inc', Metallica covered numerous bands, which include heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Mercyful Fate, Discharge, Motorhead, Queen, and Budgie. They also covered the punk band The Misfits, not to mention 70's Hard Rock bands Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blue Oyster Cult. Although songwriting is what destroyed 'Load' and 'Reload', is doesn't matter on 'Garage Inc.', because the songs are already written for Metallica! As for the first disc, which is typically criticized, I have no complaints, at ALL! \\"Free Speech For The Dumb\\" basically finds Hammett soloing his heart out, and you can't go wrong there! \\"It's Electric\\" is a fun, rip-roaring heavy metal headbanger, while Black Sabbath's \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" finds Metallica taking a sadistic song and bringing it to new levels of heaviness. \\"Turn The Page\\" and \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" are two of the most emotional tracks in Metallica's catalogue, and also some of Metallica's best. Truly, \\"One\\" is the only song that beats these songs for emotion and heart. \\"Loverman\\" and \\"Mercyful Fate\\" are progressive Heavy Metal songs featuring crazy build-ups, odd time signatures, and headbanging guitarwork! Although the first disc is excellent, the second disc is truly a masterpiece, as any 80's Metallica fan will tell you, they could never beat that era. Really, there are no words to describe this album, other than if you love Thrash, Neo-Classical Metal, wicked solos, and intense Heavy Metal like you've come to expect from Metallica, you're going to love this album. Seriously, every track on this album, from \\"Helpless\\" to \\"Crash Course in Brain Surgery\\", is just flat-out heavy metal bliss, with highlights like \\"The Small Hours\\"(one of the best Metallica songs, period), \\"Am I Evil?\\"(ditto), and the intense anger and hilariousness of \\"So What!\\" blaring out your speakers it's doubtful you won't be dead after breaking your neck from so much headbanging!<br /><br />Overall, 'Garage Inc.' is my favorite Metallica album of the 90's, even besting The Black Album, solely because of the shear wealth of material here. Although some criticize the first disc(nobody, unless you're a mute, criticizes the second album), I found it to be basically in the same vein of The Black Album's Heavy Metal/Thrash, but I was more impressed with it because of the emotion and thought that went into covering their favorite bands. Although Hammett has been a disappointment on 'Load', 'Reload,  and 'St. Anger', he sure gives quite a performance here, and this work is undoubtedly some ofhis strongest. Although people may say Metallica just released this for \\"money\\", this is one of the *few* things I agree with that Lars has done: put all their rare material and a wealth of new material on one convenient release. If you like Metallica or Heavy Metal, this album is a must. It is also one of my favorite Metallica albums, period. Although I wouldn't rate either album individually better than their 80's material, with both albums combined, well, you have quite a case there. \\"The Small Hours\\" and \\"Am I Evil?\\" are worth the price alone if you ask me!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! METALLICA'S BEST ALBUM OF THE 90'S IS ALSO ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUMS! LIKE 80'S-90'S METALLICA? YOU *HAVE* TO GET THIS!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- Disc 1- \\"It's Electric\\", \\"Turn The Page\\", \\"Mercyful Fate\\", \\"Whiskey In The Jar\\", and \\"Tuesday's Gone\\".

B0000C7PSW|5.0|This is my favorite Rufus album, followed by Poses, but i do agree with i beilve it was Paul Allastar who did a review on this album, it is a fanstastic album, but can become overwhelming with it. I can listen to it about once a week and enjoy it possibly twice but that is streching it. a highlight in the album for me is \\"Dinner at Eight\\" \\"11:11\\" \\"I Dont Know What It Is\\" etc etc. but a very great album, but you must be in a mood for Rufus i.e. last night i had a 2 hour bus ride back to my hometown and i was listenin to Rufus's self titled and someone knocked me out of my own world and asked me something, i tried to return to it but i couldnt so i suggest listening to all of wainwrights albums by yourself.
B00009XITQ|4.0|This Movie is a very good movie! The story is a real nice simple story. The characters are amazing, and the plot is nicely done! This movie is a movie that the whole family can enjoy! Great Cast, Great Story, Bottom Line it is great!
B000274THQ|3.0|This was the first forgein i have bought, because i enjoyed the idea, i expected more dark comedy from it but was somewhat dissapointed but it is a very well put together film, this is a good renter to a moive connassuer or someone who is just trying out something new.
0060920432|5.0|I use this book all the time - it has completely changed my approach to life in general. The main premise that I needed to learn is that enjoyment comes from complexity - so while our natural tendency is towards simplicity, full engagement in life ('flow') only comes about when you're fully immersed, often in a disciplined way, in a task that has rules and boundaries. In other words you need constant feedback of how well you're doing, no matter what the pursuit. Otherwise, it will all feel to simple, and you'll never achieve that higher state of 'flow'.
B00000IQC8|4.0|what a great film, the funny part about it though is that the first time you watch it it feels like the longest movie but i watched it again and enjoyed it a lot more. the film is full of one liners and pot humor(j&sb of course) a little trivia on the film Kevin Smith sold his whole comic book collection to make the movie and after the film he bought it all back and the films soundtrack cost more than the film cost itself.
0312958455|4.0|The Last Coyote might be the best of Connelly's Bosch series. I hesitate to lay such a claim upon this book if only because it does have some weaknesses in that there is much in the way of unnecessary plot additions here. A love affair that is tired and stalls the stories development comes to mind. Later in this series, you will find tighter stories, but they run into the far fetched over the top sensationalism that makes these books read like a Hollywood blockbuster rather than a serious crime drama. With that aside, I whole-heartedly recommend this book. You should enjoy it for the guilty pleasure that it is. I would say that you should build up to it, don't skip the first books in the series. It is not necessary, but  it adds quite a bit to know Bosch's past history.<br /><br />Try Hillerman or Block for consistent good books in a mystery series, or `Becker's Ring,' by Steven Martin Cohen for a good mystery read. On the more adult side try Quincunx by Palliser or `Wind Up Bird Chronicle' by Murakami. Try Hammett, Chandler, Jim Harrison, or Edward Bunkers Dog Eat Dog. These are all mysteries that are a little more serious and just as enjoyable as what Bosch offers.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|If you have my previous reviews i saw Rufus w/ ben and guster this summer, Rufus i have a huge respect and apperciation for. at first listen Rufus somewhat annoyed me with his voice but after listen to all 3 of cds in one day i was head over heels in love with it, to really enjoy Rufus you have to listen to how his cd flows and you will understand how happy it makes you and how your mind just wonders while listening to him, its like dreaming without being alseep.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When I heard that Ashton Kutcher was in a serious role, I thought it was going to be a real flop.  I'm so used to seeing him in movies where he plays a complete doofus.  This movie, however, is terrific!  It's about a guy named Evan Treborn who as a kid used to black out traumatic experiences that happened to him.  He now has to go back in time and change things.  When Evan was little he was asked to write a journal, so now when he reads those stories years later, he finds himself taken back to that day, and he is able to change all the mistakes he made as a kid. <br /> <br />At times this movie seemed confusing.  As it kept going back and forth from present to past, it was hard to tell what was happening.  It made perfect sense because all the puzzle pieces came together in the end. <br /> <br />Recommended!!!  <br />
B0000029DD|5.0|I remember seeing Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" on a friends' desk in college many times. I never heard the album, but I remember seeing it-  the cover always jumped out at me. As you have probably already read by most other reviewers, this is a magnificent piece of art. (I checked it out from the library the other day.)  It stands in stark contrast with most of today's music that relies on guitar riffs and catchy songs. Jeff Buckley's songs are catchy in a different way, an undescribable way.  <br /> <br />     There's not much I can say about the album that other people haven't already said, but I have a few things to add. <br /> <br />     The first thing is that has anyone noticed how rare a five-star rating is on Amazon? The highest rating I've seen (that I remember, I could be wrong) is four and-a-half stars. All of the Beatles' major albums (the ones that have been reviewed by more than four people) have no higher than a 4.5 rating. That's saying something about this album. <br /> <br />     Secondly, for a person to say that this is their favorite album of ALL TIME might not be rare, but it is rare to see it said so many times for the SAME ALBUM. I've read many reviews of the album by people on this site, and it's amazing how many people would take this with them to a desert island if they were only given a one-disc limit. It's also my favorite album of all time, displacing the Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,\\" the Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\" and the \\"White Album,\\" Jimi Hendrix's \\"Electric Ladyland,\\" and all the Led Zeppelin albums.  <br /> <br />     Lastly, people have spoken a lot about the ironies of this album. (i.e. All the references to Jeff's dying in the lyrics, etc.) But perhaps the most ironic thing of all, is that this great album is titled \\"Grace,\\" which just happens to be the world's greatest idea. <br /> <br />Just buy it.
B0002IU988|2.0|Tremonti is awesome but Scott Stapp was need (well when his ego goes away.) New singer really does suck!! Creed had flow and you can tell it is missing in this CD. Mabye in the future we'll see good music from Stapp and Tremonti seperatly but it crap wasn't it!
B0000CDL93|5.0|Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" is a monstrous epic that revolves around the whole mystery around President Kennedy's assassination.  While it is a dramatic picture and Stone most likely twisted a few things to make this a more relevant and better movie, it is still an undeniable powerhouse that has you go through a whole set of emotions, ranging from fear, anger, paranoia and sadness.  There's no question that the majority of the country believes that there is more to the assassination than we were lead to believe.  I don't think it's exactly how it is in the movie, but that's not important.  What is important is that the film works for many reasons.<br /><br />President Kennedy has been assassinated.  Lee Harvey Oswald is the suspect and gets shot shortly after.  There is a secretive and brief hearing on the whole assassination, and it is in stone that Oswald was a lone gunman and nobody else was involved.  Seems like an open-and-shut-case, but District Attorney Jim Garrison isn't willing to buy it.  With his staff, they decide to work on the case, until they are shut down by the government.  Three years later, Garrison isn't willing to stand by in silence anymore and decides to go ahead with the case.  The further he digs, the more horrible truths he uncovers.  Not only that, but people high up in the ranks are willing to do anything to make sure that the American Public will never find out about them.<br /><br />As I said, this isn't meant to be an entirely accurate portrayal of how everything happened.  It suggests to you that it could've been this way, and it even does a good job of presenting its case to you.  What I think Stone was trying to achieve was to create his own commentary on how people feel about the handling of the whole assassination and how sloppily the case was handled.  The film wasn't made to merely exploit the death of Kennedy, but what it does exploit is the fact that we're willing to believe anything they tell us in the media.  It's a hard concept to grasp, because it's not too far from the truth.  The movie is brilliantly directed and well-acted.  Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career.  The film has a whole list of famous actors in it, like Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and a whole bunch more.  They are all fantastic in their roles.<br /><br />A word of warning; this is a VERY LONG movie.  It is about 3 and a half hours long in running time.  If you want to watch this, then you have to really commit to it.  If you're not in the mood for a very lengthy movie, then you will not be able to enjoy this.  The new 2-Disc Special Edition offers a remastered director's cut that looks and sounds great.  Another interesting feature is the documentary, \\"Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.\\"  Extras included are deleted/extended scenes, commentary from the director, theatrical trailer, essays and DVD-ROM features.  A very nice package that does the film justice.<br /><br />JFK\\" is an amazing picture that did not bore me for a single second.  Not only does it work as a powerful drama, but it also works as an intense thriller.  Did everything happen the way the movie proposes?  Maybe, maybe not.  What the film does is make you think about everything that happened around the assassination.  Any film that can get the brain thinking is more than okay in my book.

0783117523|5.0|I just watched the movie. What a story! I read some reviewes here. My gosh, people keep telling about her being lesbian and drugs. C'ommon, that's all just wrapping. The truth is deeper. Forget all politeness. This is a story about a real girl with true emotions in this phony faked world. She was like a diamond between faked stones. She died not because of drugs. She was from a different world. She had no future here anyway.<br /><br />The movie is really great. It's amazing what Jolie has done. Truly amazing. The story looks simple at first but when you start paying attention to details it's amazing how deep she made it. Truly amzing work!<br /><br />People keep saying the drugs killed her. It's so phony! Watch the movie. Be honest with yourself. It's really one of those great movies that make you think.<br /><br />This is clearly not a light movie. See if you can handle it. Not everyone does. But if you're looking for some real emotional experience, maybe this is what you need.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I'll be honest, i bought the album, like many others, for \\"take me out\\".  The first time i listened through, i was dissapointed, wondering if wh i bought a band with such a strange vibe.  I know why...it ROCKS.  The more I listen to the CD, the better the songs get (dark of the matinee, this fire, and come on home are personal favorites).  It truly is an awesome album, kind of a re-invention of what made the 80s great...i'm a fan of modern rock, and this is right up my alley.
0385512104|4.0|This book was an interesting read, primarily since it lets you feel like you are inside the mind and thought processes of an autistic child. You realize that these children are quite normal except that Christopher does not adapt well in social interactions.<br /><br />The description in the first part of the book was very disconcerting, but you soon get over it. Read on and you will enjoy it. Many teachers have recommended it to me. I understand that the audio book is wonderful.
0380725398|4.0|JAMAICA INN has been on my \\"To Be Read\\" list for many years, so when I found an inexpensive paperback copy, it seemed like fate.  Every bit as suspenseful as REBECCA but with a more engaging heroine, it kept me on the edge of my seat almost from the beginning.<br /><br />Mary Yellan's mother dies, leaving her alone with a farm and no one to help her run it.  (Apparently, in 19th century England, it was unthinkable that a 23-year-old woman should simply hire some help and keep the farm.)  She sells up and goes to live in a distant county with an aunt she hasn't seen for ten years, but whom she remembers as pretty and vivacious.  The aunt Patience she finds, however, is much changed.  Now married to an abusive, drunken tyrant, Patience has relinquished her former self and become a cringing, wheedling shadow to her brutal husband.  The couple reside at Jamaica Inn, an infamous establishment that respectable travelers have long abandoned.<br /><br />The situation deteriorates further when inquisitive Mary discovers her uncle is involved in illegal dealings that include murder.  Horrified, she stays at Jamaica Inn only for the sake of her aunt, whom she intends to rescue.  She's befriended by the sympathetic vicar of a neighboring parish, and by her uncle's handsome brother, Jem, to whom she feels oddly drawn, despite his questionable livelihood as a horse thief.<br /><br />In true Gothic style, the story hovers on the edges of believability.  It doesn't pay to think too much on any one point.  Mary displays the obligatory intelligence, pluck and curiosity of the gothic heroine, yet loses her courage and/or her smarts at just the points where her hesitation advances the plot.  The villains of the story are pure evil without clear motivations.  Jem is the most realistically drawn character.<br /><br />But they don't write like Daphne DuMaurier anymore.  Her richly descriptive style sets you squarely down in the midst of the Cornish moors, makes you see the stark granite rocks, feel the heavy air closing around you. Her pacing is nearly perfect, dragging only in one or two spots where I think she falters in her effort to prolong suspense.  The story moves along so briskly that you're almost hypnotized into not noticing the plot's weaknesses.  It certainly isn't hard to shuffle them to the back of your mind.<br /><br />JAMAICA INN is well worth the read, especially if you're feeling a bit weary of \\"flavor-of-the-month\\" fiction.  In particular, I found Ms. DuMaurier's portrayal of the local squire as a kind-hearted, blustering dullard interesting.  I wonder if that was a reflection of current (1936) British attitudes toward the gentry.  In a similar vein, the vicar's thoughts on religion must have been provocative at the time.around you.

B000002P5W|5.0|Along with some of the other reviewers Axis: Bold as Love is my favorite Hendrix album as well.  It is truly remarkable that 36 years after I first heard this album these tracks continue to sound fresh! I simply can not get tired of listening to this album. The originality of Jimi Hendrix is rare - musicians of this caliber are few and far between. I know young kids who when listening to this for the first time are blown away!
B00009V7RF|4.0|Although this is a hip-hop/rap band, there is quite a variety of styles here. I really like them when they get into the non-rap stuff such as funk, Latin and even some metal. Plus they have a Funkedelic sense of humor, such as in the funky song \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" with fun stupid lyrics like \\"bop your head like epilepsy\\". Great album for its genre.

B000006ZAE|5.0|First off, Ill Communication is my favorite Beastie Boys album. Considering this, the Japanese import with bonus tracks was essential. That written, you have to ask yourself if $55.00 (the cost of the disc at the time of review) is a resonable price for four additional songs. Keeping in mind that you probably already own the regular LP release, the bonus songs come out to more than $13.00 each -minus shipping and handling. While you ponder this question, you can read my review of the bonus songs.<br /><br />1) 'Dope Little Song' is great. It has the same flavor as the rest of the album's hip hop songs.<br />2) 'Resolution Time' is another great tune, but I know that the identical version is released elsewhere.<br />3) 'Mullet Head' is hardcore. I generally don't care for the Beastie's hardcore tunes, and this one is no exception.<br />4) 'Vibes' is the real gem out of the bonus tracks. I can't imagine why this song wasn't released on the US version of the LP -it could have easily been a hit single. Like 'Dope Little Song,' it is sylistically similar to the other hip hop tunes on the regular disc. Considering the psychedelic vibes sample, solid verses and chorus, it's simply a great song.
0380789035|5.0|A man named Shadow is just released from prison, hoping to go back to a life he's dreamed about from afar for three years -- only to find that that world is no longer there for him. Instead, he must embark upon a journey with a mysterious man named Wednesday, as he explores himself, his past, and the country called America.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's American Gods is a brilliant book which explores the American spirit and the peculiarities and fascinating quirks of the country; it explores the deep mythological fabric which has shaped the world at large, and America specifically. It is rife with many layers of symbolism and dreamy imagery which are certainly interesting to observe unfold.<br /><br />The story posits an interesting set of questions: what if all the gods of the Old World are real and true? What would they be like in this land of ours, with our fascination with computers and credit cards, shopping malls and the internet, the media and television, a land which downplays imagination, the magical, and the fantastic? What happens when the myth of the Old World clashes with the gritty and practical entrepreneurialism of the New World?<br /><br />Here we see the great and wondrous gods of old reduced to grifters, lunatics, prostitutes, con-men, writers; beings who, devoid of belief and worship and sacrifice, must eke out mundane existences. It's hard not to enjoy the depictions of fantastic figures from myth such as Anubis, Thoth, Anansi and the rest, presented here with wit and charm and a certain alienness.<br /><br />American Gods is in many ways less a traditional novel, and more a series of vignette-styled short stories linked together by common protagonists (and antagonists); each of these vignettes aren't really woven together until the end of the book. The reader instead is presented with a variety of unique, creative, and sometimes twisted bunch of short stories. It's a roadtrip through Myth and America, and it's the journey itself -- along with all the bizarre pitstops -- is even more important than the final destination.th all the bizarre pitstops -- is even more important than the final destination.
B0000C03AH|4.0|I've never fully heard these recordings in any previous incarnation, so can't comment on improvements in the CD layer (of the 3 CD issues, the middle one, in DG's Beethoven Edition is the only one with Original Image Bit-Processing).<br /><br />I am not really a 'Kara-fan', certainly not in Beethoven although I do enjoy his digital Leonore III Overture - I feel Karajan is at his finest in Sibelius and Richard Strauss, particularly his 1960s DG recordings.<br /><br />For this set I started with the Eroica and did compare the SACD (stereo only of course) with the first CD incarnation of the cycle (in the maroon box). The old CD sounded fine with a full rich bass, but there is a definite gain in clarity and detail with the SACD layer. Slightly less bass perhaps, but this sound is more vivid and realistic, and sounds phenomenal considering its 40+ year age.<br /><br />As an interpretation this Eroica gains in distinction as it progresses: the lack of the exposition repeat in the first movement is a snag, but after an intense Funeral March the last two movement are very compelling with wonderful hunting horns in the Scherzo. In fact the playing throughout is pretty stellar. This one ranks alongside Kleiber, Scherchen, Klemperer and Rattle - as well as my own favourite, Abbado's VPO recording on DG.<br /><br />I found the SACD of the first 2 symphonies to have very slightly inferior sound and the orchestral sound is slightly more robust in scale than we are used to on modern recordings (but never bloated or overblown), and Karajan's interpretation of the First Symphony is not as compelling as the others - the performance is fairly genial, and the finale is relaxed, without the crispness and hint of tension that, say, Wand or Rattle bring to it in their fine recordings.<br /><br />With the Fourth, Karajan is really back on form: excellent playing, with a characteristically swift performance of the slow movement which otherwise can seem too long (Klemperer's on EMI seems to go on forever). Vivid detailed sound again - with the superb Eroica coupling this is perhaps the best CD to sample separately, especially with a playing time of over 80 minutes.<br /><br />Karajan's Fifth is a phenomenally powerful performance: here as elsewhere throughout the set woodwind solos are very clear, belying the view that Karajan's recordings were string-dominated, at least at this point in his career. You hear more wind, brass and percussion here than in Carlos Kleiber's famous recording. The Andante is perfectly judged, and if Karajan can't quite inject the unique charge that Kleiber puts through the scherzo and finale, there are compensations: the impetus and weight of sound are thrilling here, with instrumental lines more clearly delineated.<br /><br />Sadly, the Pastoral coupling is a write-off: devoid of charm and rather introverted, and there are far finer Sixths from Boehm, Klemperer and a host of others.<br /><br />The Seventh and Eighth are predictably good (neither are favourite works of mine), but these are just a precursor to a wonderful Choral which ranks alongside the best I've heard. I never cared for Karajan's 1977 version which is perhaps the best regarded of his 5 recordings - but this early 1960s performance sounds superb to me: the quartet of soloists (particularly the men) are excellent and the chorus are well in the aural picture, in the modern style (if not quite as vivid as in Abbado's fine live CD on Sony). Fricsay's otherwise excellent 1958 version with the same orchestra is slightly flawed in this respect. Elsewhere the performance is very powerful with magnificent playing, with a wonderful sense of spiritual repose in the Adagio.<br /><br />All in all a superb SACD cycle: the First is slightly less than compelling and you will need another Pastoral, but otherwise this is a wonderful set.I seems to go on forever).

0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond takes on a daring question in his attempt to form a more inclusive view of human history, \\"how did things get this way?\\". Most human histories focus on major civilizations, and only hit on other cultures when more advanced civilizations come into contact with them. Diamond takes the perspective of talking about what is going on all around the world at the same time, and what happened to make cultures' interactions with the West result in them becoming trading partners, slaves, conquered, subjugated, or just plain eliminated. <br /> <br /> The three main factors Diamond uses to explain this are, as the title suggests, guns, germs, and steel, or variations thereof. <br /> <br />The \\"theory\\" of European genetic superiority has often been used to explain the reasons that Europe became the dominant world culture in the modern world. Diamond steps back and looks at geographical factors as being more causal. For example, the Aboriginals probably were among the first to develop advanced watercraft, as evidenced by their very presence in Australia, but they didn't rule an empire by ruling the seas like the British did. One reason given is that they went to Australia too early. When they got to Australia, they were capable hunters, but had yet to domesticate animals and adopt it as a lifestyle. Australia at the time was full of large mammal and birds ripe for domestication. If these animals had been turned into livestock, the Aboriginals would had controlled a huge source of food, and been able to support a much larger population, that could have supported a large industrial base. Instead, the Aboriginals were adept hunters, and the large mammals and birds that had evolved isolated from such skilled predators proved to be easy prey and were soon extinct. <br /> <br />The Africans evolved alongside their animals, and hence the animals were prepared for adept hunters and more wary of humans, making them very difficult to domesticate. The Europeans, however, had the right animals living in the areas they moved into, and they moved to those areas when they were on the cusp of transitioning from hunter-gatherers to farmer-herders. This precise mix of right animals, right climate, and right time, gave the Europeans one key to control food production. <br /> <br />Another key Diamond mentions is the fact that that Eurasian landmass's major axis is east-west, as opposed to Africa's and the Americas' landmasses being oriented north-south. With an east-west landmass, domesticated plants and animals are easily transported from one region to another, since the climatic variances aren't as great as they are from north to south. This also allowed plants and animals, once domesticated, to quickly become staple foods throughout these areas. <br /> <br />With food production controlled and done so at much higher levels than anywhere else, greater population densities are possible. These greater population densities allow multiple cultures living in close proximity. With multiple cultures in close proximity and competition, technological innovations are much more likely to be exploited. The Chinese invented gunpowder, but they didn't use it to unify an empire like Europeans did. The Japanese made wonderful firearms in the 1600's (probably superior to Europeans since they applied Japanese efficiency and methodical craftsmanship to their construction), but they soon outlawed they as being inconsistent with Samurai culture. If the Chinese and the Japanese had the Germans, French, and Portuguese all nipping at their heels, it is doubtful that they would have walked away from such innovations. <br /> <br />Another thing that controlling livestock brings is disease. Many major epidemics start off as animal-borne variants since the Europeans lived with and handled animals for so long, they contracted many more diseases and built tolerances to them. Larger population densities also amplify this factor, considering the lack of civil sanitation at the time. In addition to being unprepared for European guns, other cultures were also unprepared for European germs. <br /> <br />Diaomnd makes some great points throughout this very thorough work, but the one that I found both compelling and disturbing is his refutation of the theory of European genetic superiority. Essentially, he says that since the Europeans had centralized food production and later centralized medicine, that anyone could survive and reproduce in Western society. In tribal societies where such things were not centralized, an individual's wits and intelligence were the keys to that individual finding food and surviving, and his health and constitution were his keys to surviving disease. The strong and the smart survived in tribal societies, but the weak and dumb could live in Western society, ending in genetic inferiority, not superiority. <br /> <br />Our current civilization would do well to take a cue from the Aboriginals who went to Australia and quickly eliminated all species that could have become excellent long-term food sources. The Aboriginals did so because it was easy, and they lacked foresight. We are doing the same in our total domination of the planet and subjugation of all its resources for human usage, and if we fail to learn from the lessons of the past, instead of a barren continent, we'll have a barren planet.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Yes, it was just a typo but here we are living in 1984. This movie made my heart ache for our soliders, our mothers and our country. It is a disturbing look at how if Bush had his way we would all be treated as the Iraq citizens are currently. It has very shocking footage of death and our government. I highly recommend it to every person thirteen and over.
B000092ZYX|4.0|A lot of people complain that Radiohead's newer material doesn't sound like \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"The Bends,\\" but I ask them if they want Radiohead to keep making the same album?  They're going in different directions, but I think \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is closer in form at least to their older stuff and a departure from \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Kid A.\\" <br /> <br />\\"2 + 2 = 5\\" is a great opener, I like the juxtaposition of acoustic guitar against all the trademark Radiohead weirdness.  This is also used well on \\"Go to Sleep.\\"   <br /> <br />There's a good deal of slow material on this album and the amusingly titled \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\" is a great example of their ability to slow it down, strip it down and write a fairly straight ahead tune. <br /> <br />\\"Myxomatosis\\" is a bass swelled rocker that'll get your head nodding and will test your speakers. <br /> <br />Overall, the album is probably their weakest effort after \\"Pablo Honey,\\" but considering what massive stuff they've put out, it's no shame being behind the previous four full length studio albums. <br /> <br />This is one of those albums that is stronger than the sum of its parts.  Some of the songs may not stand alone so well, but they all fit well within the full framework.  You could pull amazing tracks off of earlier albums (and there's a few here), but it's still a cohesive and fine listen.
B00005JN2X|5.0|\\"Collateral\\" was a good choice of movie.  I saw it with my sister and it was excellent!  Vincent, played superbly by Tom Cruise, is a hit man who is sent to assassinate five people in a 10-hour span in the city of Los Angeles.  He recruits Max, played by the comical Jamie Foxx.  Max is a cab driver who hopes to own his own limo service.  He picks up Vincent thinking that he is a man of importantance only to find out that he is a hitman.  A body falls from the window of the apartment building and onto his cab, right then and there he figures out who Vincent is.  To save himself, he has to do as he is told or risk being killed.  With a sense of humor and suspense, Collateral may be nominated for an oscar for best screenplay, best actor, and best director.  Michael Mann does a superb job in directing the movie as to where in L.A. events take place and in that time span.
B000060MMI|5.0|My brother once brought home a burnt CD that had Drunken Lullabies on it. I was instantly amazed by the band. My friend just happened to have been selling a mixed CD with all flogging molly songs, so i bought it from him. If you love irish pub songs and punk music, then this band is a perfect mix of both. The band is like a narcotic; you just can't get enough!  <br /> <br />I reccomend the song \\"The Devil's Dance Floor\\"
B000000OSE|5.0|After buying this album, it took me a while to like some of the material. But once I did, I really loved this album. Because the album is all about variety. From the dramatic love ballad &#34;Don't Cry&#34; to the blues-driven &#34;Bad Obsession&#34; and then to the fast-paced rocker &#34;Right Next Door to Hell&#34;. There is no filler on here (contrary to other reviews.) &#34;Filler&#34; does not mean &#34;absence of hit single&#34;. The reason a lot of these songs didn't make it big was because of language, mature themes and length. The lyrics, instrumentals- all great. I will rate every song out of 5. So....here goes: <br /> <br />1. Right Next Door To Hell &#62; One of my fav. speed rockers. Intro really stands out, fast but good song. Lyrics are great too (as usual.) 5/5 <br /> <br />2. Dust N' Bones &#62; An Izzy song. But a good Izzy song. Very profound &#34;blues&#34; feel. 4/5 <br />3. Live And Let Die  &#62; Guns' best cover on Illusions, vocals are really, really good and deep. Also, a big hit on radio. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. Don't Cry (Original) &#62; If you love the &#34;hit&#34; singles, you will love this song. I personally don't care for it. I feel it's overproduced (as the guitar can barely be heard admist all the production.) Lyrics are nice but a tad too dramatic for my liking. 3/5 <br /> <br />5. Perfect Crime &#62; Another great rocker. Love it! Axl comes in with a screeching opening note. Lyrics are very good here. 4/5 <br /> <br />6. You Ain't The First &#62; Nice blues song (it's Izzy's.) Slow-paced but good. I enjoyed it. 4/5        <br /> <br />7. Bad Obsession &#62; Teddy Zig Zag on harmonica. Nice intro. Lyrics and Slash's guitar mastery make this song great. One of the longer rockers on here. 4/5          <br /> <br />8. Back Off Bitch &#62; Old song from the 80s GNR had written for a while before finally putting this out on album. Long song..but good. Lyrics are catchy and complex at the same time. Great solo. 5/5          <br /> <br />9.Double Talkin' Jive &#62; Unique song. Much more of a Slash track. Quick intro into a great outro. 4/5         <br /> <br />10. November Rain &#62; Another big hit song. Orchestraic masterpiece. Vocal work is tremdendous. Guitar work and Axl's piano abilities are real profound in this song. My favorite of GNR's mainstream &#34;Illusion&#34; hits. 5/5        <br /> <br />11. The Garden &#62; I really don't like this song. Never a big fan of Alice Cooper. But still decent. 3/5        <br /> <br />12. Garden Of Eden &#62; Like &#34;Right Next Door to Hell&#34;, a great fast rocker. Lyrics push for a &#34;rebellious&#34; theme against society and the government. Nice solo too. 4/5    <br /> <br />13. Don't Damn Me &#62; Probably my favorite rocker on here. Lyrics, vocal work, guitar, Matt Sorum wailing away on the drums....where can you go wrong? 5/5          <br /> <br />14. Bad Apples &#62; Really enjoyed this one. Not really a fast one but good nonetheless. 4/5         <br /> <br />15. Dead Horse &#62; This is Axl's attempt at his own rocker. Great intro and the lyrics are excellent. Nice job. 5/5           <br /> <br />16. Coma &#62; This is the big epic on this album. Over 10 minutes long and multi-textured with the theme around (you guessed it), being in a coma. From the opening theme of feeling at peace, then progressing towards a much more intense mood and then finally leveling off with a feeling of depression and isolation. Best lyrics on any Guns n' Roses song. Incredible epic. 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall, this album is nothing short of a masterpiece and if you like Guns n' Roses...or good rock music, buy this album.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I once saw a tribute to Tom Hanks where they dismissed this movie as one of his inconsequential early works. Initially, I was incredulous about this because this movie has a special place in my heart as probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. But after I thought about it a bit, I think I understand the point made in that tribute.  This movie is not a showcase for actors, the uncontested star of this movie is the house.    The three main actors, Hanks, Shelley Long, and Alexander Gudunov are all terrific in their roles, but the little love-triangle drama that goes on between them serves only as a backdrop and a reason to pull off all those ingenious sight-gags with the house.    In this movie, the script writer and set technicians are king.  These professionals ought to have a showcase for their talents to be spotlighted from time to time, and they sure made the most of the opportunity with this one.  The calamitous frailty of this ostensibly beautiful house renders so many brilliantly done scenes that this movie still makes me laugh out loud after seeing it several times.  A joke loses all its power to amuse after the surprise of the punch-line is lost, but these sight-gags are so funny I can break out laughing while driving down a lonely highway just thinking about them.    Some movies lose their effectiveness because the makers get confused and try to do too may things - the message gets muddled.  The best movies exhibit no such confusion and tell their story with minimal distraction.  This movie is about this house, and what these artists do with this prop is brilliantly and enduringly funny.    Even in my business, where everyone has seen this movie, and we ought to be more serious, when anyone inquires about some project we know well will be completed when hell freezes over, if then, our stock answer is \\"Two weeks!\\"
B0002DB52M|5.0|Lars von Trier's \\"Dogville\\" is one of the best films of the year. It is also sometimes very difficult to watch because of its subject matter and three hour running time. However, it is an extremely great movie, worth every second you put into it. Trier's direction and screenplay are superb, and the acting by the ensemble of sixteen actors is uniformly excellent.<br /><br />\\"Dogville\\" tells the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman), a woman who is on the run from her mobster father. She makes her way to Dogville, a small, forgotten town of only fifteen residents and a dog. Grace meets Tom Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany), a young would-be writer who tries to understand the human condition. The residents of Dogville give Grace two weeks to endear herself to them. Grace does this by performing small chores for the residents: babysitting the children of Vera (Patricia Clarkson), helping Chuck (Stellan Skarsgaard) in his apple orchard, working at Ma Ginger's (Lauren Bacall) general store, and being a companion for an old blind man (Ben Gazzara). The town allows her to stay, and for a while Grace is very happy there. To Grace, Dogville is a place \\"where people have hopes and dreams.\\" She and Tom slowly begin to fall in love, but there are subtle clues that something ominous is on the way. Soon Dogville turns against Grace, chaining her up like an animal, making her into a virtual slave. She is also subjected to nightly rape by the men of the town. When Grace's father returns, she decides to exercise violent retribution against the citizens of Dogville.<br /><br />The experimental way in which \\"Dogville\\" was shot is fascinating and arresting. The town is represented by chalk outlines on a large soundstage, with the actors miming the opening and closing of doors. There are some fragments of set pieces, like a desk, bed, or bench, but for the most part the stage is blank. This allows you to see what all the characters are doing all of the time, and forces you to focus on the people and the acting. \\"Dogville\\" works so well because it takes the time to define all of its inhabitants. Paul Bettany is great as Tom, and Patricia Clarkson is positively brilliant as the cruel and fragile Vera. Other standouts are Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgaard, and Chloe Sevigny. John Hurt is also noteworthy as the film's acidic narrator. But as Grace, Nicole Kidman delivers an emotionally naked performance that stands proudly alongside her revelatory work in \\"The Hours.\\" Her Grace is a good, trusting, forgiving woman who opens her heart to Dogville, which in turn tries to destroy her. Kidman is utterly amazing to watch, and Trier puts her through immense pain and suffering. It's no surprise that Kidman backed out of the second film in this trilogy. Her intense work on \\"Dogville\\" was probably not something she could endure again. But we are left with a raw and stunning performance from the best actress of her generation.<br /><br />At three hours, \\"Dogville\\" does run a little long, but every scene is essential. Because you spend so much time with this town and its people, you become deeply involved in what happens. \\"Dogville\\" is also a very disturbing movie to watch, with the inhuman cruelty visited on Grace and the violent, shocking denoument. It has been said that the film is anti-American, and I would have to agree. With one of the central themes being the destructiveness of arrogance and an ending credits sequence that shows pictures of the homeless to the tune of David Bowie's \\"Young Americans,\\" it is obvious where Trier's sympathies lie. But so what if the movie is anti-American? It is a brave, brilliant film that dares to show the darkness of human nature, which is completely universal. Anyone interested in challenging filmmaking should see it.<br /><br />\\"Dogville\\" is not solely about Grace's transformation from a good and trusting woman into a cold killer. It's more complex than that. In the end, when Grave is as cruel and inhumane to Dogville as itwas to her, Trier shows a shot of her face. It is covered with tears.le as it was to her, Trier shows a shot of her face. It is covered with tears.
B00000JTB2|1.0|I read the first 26 reviews with increasing concern about my hearing ability. Then, finally, the 27th reviewer asked, \\"does no one hear that Albert is out of tune...?\\" Come on, folks! I've been a blues fan for 40 years and have given my sweat, tears and $$ to see, hear and experience America's real classical music. The facts are the facts and the fact is, Albert is DREADFULLY out of tune throughout the entire session. <br />It is so bad that I finally had to get rid of my copy. It broke my heart that Albert couldn't stand up for himself and retract that piece of trash. Those who experienced an Albert King show know full well that if Albert didn't like it IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! <br />Albert didn't take any s**t from anyone. This disc is an insult to Albert, Stevie and every serious fan of the blues.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|Such a bad CD.  I can't understand how so many people like it.  I've listened to it twice, thinking maybe I missed something.  Nope.  It's just horrible.  Buy it if you feel like wasting money.  I'm going to try to return it as soon as possible.  Such a waste.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is one of those films where everything comes together just exactly right for a really magical result.  Bill Murray was born for this role, and Andie MacDowell is exactly right for the object of his attention. <br /> <br />The first time I saw this movie I laughed so hard at some scenes I thought I would asphyxiate!  Murray's cynical expressions, combined with the exquisite timing of the direction and the semi-reality of the predicaments create this extreme humor. <br /> <br />These traits alone make this movie well worth watching-several times-but there is an allegorical message here that is acutely life-affirming.  Other reviewers have drawn the analogy of a life in a rut, and I respect that view, but in this story I saw a somewhat different message. <br /> <br />To me this is an allegory of an immortal soul being recycled endlessly until it (the soul) \\"gets it right.\\"  That is to say, this is a story of reincarnation where the time sequence is metaphorically compressed to the span of a single day, rather than an entire lifetime.  In this story, the soul continues to grow and grow, that is, it gains wisdom and enlightenment, and finally fulfills its purpose. <br /> <br />Delivering this message in this package of superbly watchable entertainment is no mean accomplishment.  This is one wonderful and worthwhile film. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|As a longtime and devoted fan of Star Wars, I've looked forward to the release of the Trilogy on DVD with eagerness for quite a while.  However, the reviews that are written from the points of view of a few ignorant viewers are not accurate on how the Special Edition additions contribute to these timeless films.  First of all, before any aspect of Star Wars is analyzed, we must all first remember that these were films created from B movie serials FOR CHILDREN.  As much as we all love to find all the adult themes and mystic qualities, these are films that were first made for the entertainment of children.  So, settle down.   <br /> <br />Secondly, and more importantly, the negative reviewers of the Special Edition fail, as do many of the film critics of the prequels, to see that these are not individual movies.  This is a six part saga.  So thus, it's probably a good idea to have some continuation throughout the series.  You see the progression of characters and design in the prequels to end up where the designs are in the original trilogy.  So it makes perfect sense to add scenes to these films, for the continuation and EASE OF UNDERSTANDING for the story.  You cannot tell me that the addition of one scene with Han and Jabba, or some extra battle shots in the Death Star are going to completely ruin your experience of the movie.  If so, you're an easily distracted fool, who doesn't grasp the magic of this story.  While in some times, the added scenes may not add a ton to the plot, they certainly do not detract.  Maybe, once we look at this as more than 3 individual movies, and more as an epic story, we can get away from ignorant accusations of George Lucas being a malicious freak.  Enjoy them for what they're worth.  That's time a lot better spent than whining about a little change.
B000002KGT|3.0|This is not a bad album nor a masterpiece either. The fact that it sold millions of copies doesn't make it less overrated.     Fave song - Gold Dust Woman.  Least liked song - Don't Stop.    3/5.
B0000024JN|5.0|<br />The Beastie Boys made their first mark on the world with this album and it was a good one too. Possibly their best album, the Beastie Boys combine rock with rap and do a good job of it. The opening track, \\"Rhymin' and Stealin'\\" was more of a rap song but later tracks such as \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\" and \\"Fight For Your Right\\" had a rock background but the boys were rapping to it, creating an awesome fusion. While some of the songs are short, this is still a classic album that anyone can enjoy. If you haven't bought it yet, you've had 18 years to do so so go out and buy the damn thing!!!
6304698623|5.0|I actually just saw this movie on the family channel on t.v. last week and I was captured by it.  I realize this is kind of a kid's movie and I'm 27 years old, but this movie touched me. I cried twice in the movie and afterwards I just had to find out more about it.  It reminded me of a cross between Annie and The Secret Garden.<br /><br />Sara, the main girl in the movie had such an incredible spirit and imagination.  She knew what all little girls wanted and that was to be imaginative as a way of having fun and getting through difficult situations.<br /><br />This was a very well made movie, especially the war scenes.  I cannot believe how good of an actress that little girl is.  A must see movie for anyone!
0553582445|5.0|this is by far the best book i have ever read, and i read quite a fair amount... the characters in this book and the scenery are so well described, you'd swear you were right there with them watchin everything go on... as you read more in the book, the more you learn about and grow to love that character.robin hobb is the best writer i have seen in my life, yes even betta than the wonderful dr suess.... if you want a really good read then i recommend you read all the trilogies by robin hobb, 1st and 3rd trilogies are the best and this is my fave book out of all of them, so emotional, so adventrous, i loved every minute i took of reading this book, and found it impossible to put it down, so i usually stayed up reading for hours on end till my eyes went all blurry from being open so long.... my advice is buy the book, if u want a good fantasy read, it rulez
B00024BHTC|5.0|Once is the best CD so far this year.  Once is a beautiful CD.  The ballads are so melodic you can play if for your mother.  Yet it has enough rockin', head tossin' music to make your kid want to hear it  The mix is fantastic.  The bass is so deep, the ambient sounds make you feel like you are there.  And the voices are amazaing.  Tarja is a magnificent, beautiful, sexy angel.  She is here to show us what a real vocalist can do.  If you have never heard Nightwish, this is an excellent CD to start with.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is probably one of the only white rappers i respect. Some of his songs may be about nothing, but other times he spits the truth. This guys lyrical skills are better than 2/3 of the black rappers lyrical skills. This is definatly his best album, with \\"the eminem show\\" being a close second. The two best songs on here are \\"the way i am\\" and \\"stan.\\" I wanna see eminem and lil wyte go at it once. Both are lyrically gifted and both can flow like a mothaf*cker. Pick this album up if you dont got it already.
B0000028RR|5.0|The only thing I dont like about RATM is that they are not a band anymore. Audioslave is ok but they are nowhere near RATM. Does that mean Zach DeLa Rocha was the heart of this band? I dont know, but when these guys were together they could not be stopped. With a tasteful blend of metal, rap(which i normally hate), funk, and straight up power rock RATM makes up a band that cannot be beat. One of the most incredible things about them is that they not only talk the talk with their music but they also walk the walk in ther daily lives. They are involved and active, not like some bands whose lyrics are merely gimmicks to sell albums. Even still, Mr. DeLa Rocha and friends are involved and speaking their mind making a difference. More power to them!!!
B00006879E|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! The music is absolutely incredible.  It's hard for me to believe that this album is really 2 years old. I wish I had caught on sooner.

B0000508U6|5.0|I absolutely adore Coldplay for a few reasons:    (1) The music is versatile: it moves from rock to pop to jazz to anything delightful to listen to.    (2) The lyrics are meaningful and real - words with real emotion, passion, and love. And, finally:    (3) This album is perfect to listen to while trying to relax or fall asleep.    The music is not overbearing or too hard, and the singing not too loud or obnoxious.    Besides the fact that 'Parachutes' is the perfect down-time music, it can also be appreciated for Coldplay's first American cross-over album bearing milestone hits. 'Yellow,' the underestimated, yet timeless, ballad, and 'Trouble' are both songs that are recognized and well-loved by the general public. The other songs, ones that are possibly less famous, are still worthwile, and hardly less graceful than their radio predecessors.    Overall, 'Parachutes' is a definite must-have to any music collection! Five stars!
0385510438|4.0|Enjoyed the book a lot, not Grisham's typical courtroom drama. ALthough there were courtroom scenes in the book the story was told not from a Lawyer's perspective but from the town's newspaper owner.  Found the main character courageous as he took a newspaper famous mainly for lenghthy obituaries to doubling the circulation by printing what he felt the town NEEDED to know about situations that had been ignored for many years.  <br /> <br />
B000000WHC|2.0|This album features some real nice guitar work. However this is album is more pop than the blues. I personally am not much into pop music - as a result this album left me disappointed.     This album can appear bland and almost synthetic. If Electric blues artists like Micheal Bloomfield, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy or Eric Clapton interest you - you probably want to give this album a pass.
6305280762|3.0|\\"The Towering Inferno\\" (1974) is by far the best of the '70's disaster epics, with only \\"Airport\\" (1970) and \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" (1972) in the same league.  A fast-paced 165-minute thrill ride with an impressive all-star cast and terrific special effects, it stands head-and-shoulders above the rest of the cheezy pack of disaster bombs, many of which were produced by \\"Inferno\\"'s own producer/co-director Irwin Allen, the so-called \\"master of disaster.\\"   <br /> <br />(A note:  John Guillerman is the credited director, but he only worked on the dramatic sequences.  Allen is credited as \\"action sequences director,\\" which means he helmed probably three-quarters of the film.) <br /> <br />Actually, in 1974, \\"The Towering Inferno\\" was such a massive undertaking that two studios (Warner Bros. and Twentieth Century-Fox) combined to make it, which was unheard of in the days of the Hollywood studio system.  This enabled Allen to put together a budget that allowed him to hire a top cast including above-title players Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden and Faye Dunaway.  Add screen legends Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones, TV superstars Richard Chamberlain, Robert Vaughn and Robert Wagner, gridiron great (and future pariah) O.J. Simpson, up-and-coming starlet Susan Blakely and future soap queen Susan Flannery and for once you have a true all-star cast instead of a group of cut-rate comics and out-of-work sitcom stars.  <br /> <br />The plot revolves around the grand opening of the world's tallest building, the 135-floor \\"Glass Tower,\\" which sits in the middle of San Francisco.  The penthouse ballroom is packed with partygoers when a small fire breaks out fifty floors below.  By the time fire chief McQueen orders stubborn builder Holden to move the party downstairs, it is too late.  The fire has spread and authorities have to figure out how to evacuate 200 people before the quickly-spreading fire engulfs the ballroom.   <br /> <br />What makes \\"The Towering Inferno\\" work so well is the cliffhanger aspect of the plot.  Unlike the \\"Airport\\" movies, the vastness of the building allows for multiple rescue attempts throughout the building, so once the fire starts, the action doesn't let up for nearly two hours.  There simply is no need for the filler and dead space that made, say, \\"Airport 1975\\" such a chore to sit through.  Some of the best action set-pieces:  McQueen's almost single-handed rescuing of the packed glass elevator, Newman and Jones rescuing two children by journeying up through the fire-ravaged building, and the final last-ditch attempt to douse the fire and save the remaining victims.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the film is marred somewhat by a cold-blooded tendency to kill off castmembers in as violent a manner as possible.  One popular cast member's death, in fact, is so unexpected and disturbing the audience I first saw the film with booed and groaned when it happened (hint: it involves the glass elevator).  And considering the events of 9/11/01, the entire premise of the film and the sight of people falling 135 stories to their deaths will be highly disturbing and offensive to some.  That's probably why the film, which aired frequently on AMC before that tragedy, never seems to be shown anymore, so a word of caution seems to be in order. <br /> <br />As for the cast, everyone performs with earnestness and competence, with McQueen and Newman standing out with forceful performances as the heroes, along with a touching Jones as a lonely widow who is being romanced by con man Fred Astaire.  (In fact, Astaire received the cast's sole Oscar nomination, and he was actually favored to win over Robert Deniro in \\"Godfather, Part II\\"; fortunately, the Academy came to its senses.)  As for Simpson, unfortunately this is the only one of his '70's films in which he doesn't die, but don't worry:  he has only a handful of scenes, then he disappears after saving Jones' cat only to make a brief appearance at the end.   <br /> <br />Yes, \\"The Towering Inferno\\" relies heavily on cliches.  And, yes, the establishing scenes are at times laughably bad.  And it DEFINITELY didn't deserve to be nominated for Best Picture of 1974 alongside \\"Chinatown,\\" \\"The Conversation,\\" \\"Lenny,\\" and \\"The Godfather Part II,\\" and over such worthy classics as \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein.\\" But for what it is, it is top-of-the-line, and next to other disaster epics of the day, it is \\"Citizen Kane.\\"  Fans will love it, and will forgive its flaws and the limitations of the genre. <br /> <br />My only complaint:  the bare-bones DVD presentation, with 2:35:1 widescreen and remastered sound and picture and nothing else.  Even the special edition VHS copy has a making-of featurette and the original trailer.  So, hopefully, Fox DVD will get on the ball. <br /> <br />Until then, the film rates **** (out of *****) while the DVD rates **.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This album has to be one of the best live recordings I have ever heard.  Yes, the sound quality may not be that great, but this show just absolutely rocks.  Some people gripe about the order being messed about with Tommy being alone on disk 2 but I actually prefere this.  Sometimes I'm just not in the mood to listen to Tommy and want to hear just disk 1.  When I'm in the mood to listen to the whole concert I just program the CD player to play disk 2 right after \\"Quick One\\" and it works out just fine.  One last note, I love the guitar solo on \\"My Generation\\" when he is playing with his own echo.  Pete Townshend is an underrated guitarest that deserves more credit than he gets.  This is mainly because he isn't as flashy as Jimmy Page or Jimmy Hendrix, but I guarantee that he influenced the both of them.  Anyways, quit your griping about Tommy being on disk 2 and just enjoy the fact that we finally have the complete concert.
078322737X|5.0|Early George(Star Wars)Lucas outing with Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Richard Dreyfuss, underated actor Paul LeMat, a cameo by Wolfman Jack and more.  I deen this movie 84 times. 73 in the theater when it was first released. The film lasted over a year in the theaters and had a 41 track soundtrack that was popular because the 50s music had made a comeback in the early 70s. TV Shows like Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, Sons And Daughters and a hill of other movies based in the era never to outdo the popularity of this movie.  It's all for fun anyways.  The happy music, the pranks, the gorgeous cars....you just get that feeling that you are there having a good time with the cast.  There is nothing bad to say about the movie and you will definately end the movie with spirits up...........well until the end credits....you'll see.
B00005JLKB|3.0|The thing that is most responsible for the success of this show is its wide apeal. Innocent and light hearted enough to be enjoyed by kids and yet, serious and touching enough to be enjoyed by teens and adults. Smallville is good stuff, but it does have its drawbacks. The villain of the week format doesn't work, at least not at this stage in the show. Also, the show sometimes requires a huge suspension of disbelief. Not so much with the sci-fi elements of the show but with other things, for instance, the town is covered in kryptonite or \\"meteor rocks\\" (as they were refered to in the first season), and yet, the Kents stay in Smallville, and the fact that the editor of a small town high school newspaper can get access to the type of information that even journalists at the New York Times don't have access to, but I Digress. Luckily for this show it has great leads in Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk, who is more than just eye candy. The shows compelling human drama is its selling point and something it leans very heavily on during the season. The show will win you over in the first few episodes, drawbacks and all.
B000002L82|5.0|This album is definitely in my top 10 of 1980s albums. I listened to it daily throughout 1983 and 1984. That said, I believe some clarification is in order. <br /> <br />The review just previous to this one incorrectly states that \\"The Village\\" was not on the original \\"Power, Corruption & Lies\\" that was released on vinyl in 1983. Actually, \\"The Village\\" was on the album, but \\"Blue Monday\\" backed with \\"The Beach\\" was a separate 12\\" single from around the same time. It was added when the album was released on CD a few years later. Unfortunately the record label thought it fitting to disrupt the original track order and \\"flow\\" of the album. These two songs should be listed as \\"bonus tracks\\" and be put at the end of the album, or maybe be left off altogether, since they are also on the \\"Substance\\" collection. What's more, Amazon didn't help by having their own review done by someone who was obviously unfamiliar with the original album.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|Manu's \\"Esperanza\\" is a work of genius. This CD is my absolute favorite, and one that I constatly have on repeat. Yes he does 'repeat' tunes, but it's not because of a lack of creativity as some people might say. It contributes to the overall feel of the cd, it's an on going fiesta. Think of this CD not as 17 individual songs, but as one amazing journey through the complex psyche of Manu. For any newcomers to the world of Manu Chao: give it a chance and listen to it all the way through. I'm sure that at the end you'll want to listen to it all over again. If you have any questions, you can email me at whyciao@hotmail.com <br /> <br />Merry Listening!
B000003TAR|5.0|\\"Don't stay!/ Test me!\\"    That haunting line from \\"Milk It\\" sums up Kurt's whole relationship with the media-[hooker] and his fans at the same time. I think he saw them as one in the same. Kurt was both the sickest and gifted man I ever laid eyes on. I love him for his music, but I love him for his illness that gave him the gift to express his churning, puss-filled insides even more. He didn't want to stay in his own skin let alone his own life, so that's why he wisely took his own. He knew he needed to do that to better his soul, and I'll always respect him for that. He did what he wanted, when he wanted, and having a daughter and drug-addicted wife weren't going to stop him from living the independent Punk lifestyle he chose. Kurt's self-medication with heroin takes on many manifestations as seen on In Utero. His lyrics in many In Utero songs were abstract medical observations pieced together with good 'ol Punk Rock know-how. Sure, it's not \\"fun\\" music, but who needs fun when you can hole yourself up in your walk-in closet, hide away from the world, and shoot your dope all day? Drugs were the one thing that made Kurt happy, so he was right to make himself happy. KurDt Kobayne, you know you're right.    I can feel Kurdt's pain in the depths of my weary soul!       Best songs: \\"Milk It\\", \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" and \\"Frances Farmer\\"
0767802470|5.0|I might be young but I still know a good film when I see it. This is a war movie but it's not. With alot of great war films there has been extreme violence and even though  realistic I dont always need to see a head blown off or leg or what ever. can live with out. Das Boot on the other hand has  violence yes this is a war film but relies on more suspense and what you hear or maybe even worse what you dont hear.  this movie is for people who like suspense films, war films or just a great drama. Dont past this movie up if you get a chance to see it. Also watch the film in german with subtitles it amazing how different the film is dubbed.

B000002TYX|4.0|This is the first two disc set in the three volume Anthology series, featuring rare Beatles recordings.  This set covers 1958 to 1964, plus the \\"new\\" song \\"Free as a Bird\\".  There are some great moments here, but there are also parts that are interesting purely for historical reasons.  That is to say, the earliest recordings here are poorly played and poorly recorded.  But they are interesting, in that you can track the evolution of the group.  I think this collection will appeal to hardcore Beatlemaniacs only.

0679777547|4.0|Even Johnny Depp couldn't save \\"The Ninth Gate\\", an appalling mish-mash of a film that didn't make much sense on any level, but \\"The Club Dumas\\", the book on which it is based, is a very enjoyable read. In Lucas Corso, Arturo Perez-Reverte has created an appealingly unappealing hero. Corso is a book detective, whose job is tracking down rare volumes for discerning collectors who don't mind using Corso to do their dirty work. And this he does with gusto, for, after all, he's being well paid for it. Corso will betray his best friend or sell his grandmother for a copy of a rare volume if the price is right. Perez draws us into the world of rare books and book dealers so convincingly that we can almost breathe in the dust of incunabula that have lain undiscovered and untouched for centuries.<br /><br />This time around, Corso has a double job ahead -- he has to verify if the recently discovered, unpublished chapter of Alexandre Dumas' \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is genuine, and he also needs to determine if a copy of \\"The Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\" is a forgery. \\"The Nine Doors\\", a volume written by Aristide Torchia which got him burned alive on the Campo Di Fiori near the end of the Inquisition, supposedly contains the secret of summoning the Devil up from Hell.<br /><br />It turns out there are only three copies of \\"The Nine Doors\\" left in the world; all the others were tossed onto the pyre along with their author. It's Corso's job to track them down and see if any, or all of them, are genuine or not. The secret may lie in the nine illustrations in each volume, conveniently reproduced for the reader in \\"The Club Dumas\\", and Perez-Reverte goes into great detail in showing the reader how the nine illustrations in each volume differ from each other. So which book is a fake, or are all of them fakes? Corso tracks down two of the volumes, but lo and behold, there's devil and all to pay -- each owner meets a nasty death, and somebody with murder on his mind is on Corso's own track. But Corso isn't a detective for nothing; he not only resolves the question of the authenticity of the chapter of the Dumas novel, he discovers that part of each of the three volumes of \\"The Nine Doors\\" holds the secret to calling up Beelzebub from the netherworld. Only in the right combination can this be achieved, and it's the owner of the third volume who turns out to have commissioned Corso's search, in order to have all the ingredients at hand.<br /><br />The book follows two story lines -- the attempt to verify the authenticity of the Dumas volume and the the search for the missing volume of the \\"Nine Doors\\", and the latter is vastly more interesting. In fact, the two separate plot lines appear to have little to do with each other because the story of the Dumas book is not nearly as well developed. Neither is character development one of Perez's strong points. The characters don't grow in this book; they just are. We see them less as personalities than as the jobs they have to do. But the story of the quest for the third volume of the \\"Nine Doors\\" is great fun, and the Perez-Reverte brings in more twists and convolutions than a Chinese puzzle; the book races along like a runaway freight train, but never careens out of control. For all the twist and turns, it knows where it's going, and carries the reader right along to the final page. And as Corso, the reader, and the unfortunate owner of the last volume of the \\"Nine Doors\\" all find out, everyone gets the devil he deserves.<br /><br />Judy Linds own track.

B00028HBKM|5.0|To start off with, I actually have an early release of the dvd, so my stars are based on that, not the cinema. <br /> <br />I made it through about six or seven pages on reviews before I decided to write this and from what I see, three subjects usually appear as the reason for bad reviews. <br /> <br />The first reason is it is too violent.  We all knew this, before we even went to see it.  It was all over news, media, etc.  We were warned not to take our kids, be prepared for violence, not for the weak of heart.  So, if you went expecting scenes of the beach, then that is your own fault.  I didn't watch it hoping to see a blood bath, but I knew it was coming.I am a very faithful Protestant, and I do see some Catholic overtones in the story, but that is Mel's interpretation and overall I felt it was pretty accurate.  It is interesting to me that all of these people that may or may not have a personal relationship with Jesus, seem to know that if he were here today, he would not support this film.   <br /> <br />The second reason people complain is because it doesn't tell the full story of Jesus.  It isn't supposed to.  It is the Passion of the Christ, and passion means suffering.  It isn't the story of the Christ or the Gospel of the Christ.  It is basically a Passion play put to cinema.  He isn't trying to show us the teachings of Jesus, he is showing us the suffering of Jesus.  He is showing us what He went through for us.  If you see this movie and aren't moved by the sacrifice that He made for all of us to be free, then you don't get it.  And if you don't understand and you don't get it, then that is ok, I pray someday that you will. <br /> <br />The third thing I pick up on in these reviews is that Mel is using it just for profit.  He has made money at ever other movie he has made I am sure, and yet no one ever questions his motives then.  Yet, when he comes out with something of a religious nature when we are in a world that requires us to be politically correct, then he was just doing it for money.  He put up his own money and I personally hope he makes all the money he can off of it, not that he needs it.  So what if there is a director's cut later on?  How may different directors editions or box sets of Lord of the Rings are out there?  I get tired of having to apologize for what I believe.  If someone stands up for an important issue, whatever the hot topic of the week is, then that is their right to voice their opinion and they expect everyone to recieve it and agree.  But if I as a Christian stand up for what I believe, then I am a \\"Jesus Freak\\" or a \\"Fanatic\\".  So if you don't agree with me, that is your right, but if I don't believe what you do, then I am narrow minded??  What happened to my right to my own beliefs? <br /> <br />While I am still on my soap box, it is amazing to me that people still think this film is anti-semitic.  If you have any knowledge of the history prior to this then you should know that Jews were a large part of this area, so who else would send Jesus to the cross?  He was Jewish, it was just the circumstances.  And if you don't know the history, then read the bible, don't blame Gibson. <br /> <br />Back to the movie, I liked the dvd, thought it was a great movie.  I tip my hat to Mel Gibson for having the courage to put his money where his mouth is and put his beliefs to film. <br /> <br />God Bless

B00005ASOI|1.0|I bought this dvd based on everyone's reviews.  The soundtrack was the only thing good about this movie
B0001LJC2K|5.0|similarity to radiohead is superficial, goes away really quickly. radiohead stopped composing songs somewhere around OK computer. I cannot understand how people can still appreciate them so much. muse is the best band of our time by far. listen to this album a couple times, you'll understand what I mean. I was thinking there would be no more original rock bands, and the trend seemed to support what I think: a million U2 clowns, when U2 is not a good band to start with, thats the situation of rock music today. but muse proved me wrong.
6304708521|1.0|\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" has a fantastic soundtrack. Why not purchase it instead and save yourself the annoyance this DVD will bring? There is plenty of great raw material here. The concept of a bus trip with annoying, eccentric characters is very sound. This could have been a marvelous, psychedelic update to \\"Help\\" or \\"A Hard Days' Night.\\" Instead, it's a disaster. The Beatles' performances (save Ringo) are actually the worst thing about this mess, which features sloppy editing and clumsy camerawork. The character actors appear to be having a great time, whereas John, Paul, and George look bored to tears or stoned - save for the scene where they enjoy a striptease in SoHo. If you are reading this review, you probably love the Beatles so please - just buy the soundtrack and enjoy what the Beatles were best at. If you must see late 1960s British films, try \\"Blow Up\\" or \\"The Italian Job\\" or \\"Alfie.\\" If psychedelicia is what you want, try \\"The Trip.\\" Just don't buy this movie.

0808514121|5.0|Yes Dear Readers, it is I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone. To start, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone must say that this \\"novella\\" is nothing but disgusting bit of nonsense. Joseph Steinbeck should be ashamed of what is perhaps his worst and only attempt at litarature! First off, he's not even Colonial, so his attempt to pass off this offensive story as \\"American Literature\\" offends and harms all in that noble field. Firstly, Joseph \\"One-Eye\\" Steinbeck cheats most horribly at croquet! Secondly, the whole story was nothing but the disgusting sharing of the nuptial bed betwixt two (or, dear reader, sometimes more. I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, kid not!) lusty pimple-faced youths who have not been sanctified in the eyes of Our Maker! This is pornography of the worst kind! Yes Yes. Far worse even than the illegal set of French lithographs that I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, once mistakenly saw in my youth. But I digress. The story is rather simplistic and utterly devoid of \\"Literal\\" terms like symbolism, imagery, and talking rodents. <br /> <br />So I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone shall summarize the story. <br /> <br />East of Eton: Life at a Private English Boarding School <br /> <br />By that Cheating Cad and Bounder, Joseph \\"One-Eye\\" Steinbeck <br /> <br />Curly Spankletops and his brother, Norbert arrive at Eton to find it ruled by a fascist headmaster named (ironically meaning \\"most funnily\\" for all of those who are unfamiliar with the terms we American Literature scholars use) Hans. Hans, Curly and Norbert are all in love with Cathy Ames, a local farm girl who serves the milk at breakfast time and passes out bibles during prayers. Unfortunately DISCLAIMER: I MUST NOW SKIP THE NEXT 1,320 PAGES FOR IT IS FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT SIN! <br /> <br />Thankfully Abra saves the day with her pet ferret, Joe, and wins the heart of Percy.  <br /> <br />The End. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Awful rot, wot? Yes Yes. Thankfully I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, am holy enough in the eyes of Jehova, Our Lord and Maker, that I shall not be punished for reading these words of sin. I have warned you, Dear Reader. Heed well my warning. Sooth! I have saved your very soul from years in the burning fires of the Colonies.  <br /> <br />Hark! I Smell Gruel! <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Chewing Noisily, <br /> <br />Professor Emeritus Johnstone <br /> <br />Emeritus Professor of American Literature <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />(Darkest India) <br />

B0002QXAD6|4.0|Says the intro to the album. This new work of Nightwish is a whole new set of dreams, fantasies, realities, and themes. The symbolism is also a lot stronger than on Century Child. Its \\"heavier\\" in the sense, yet it is still an evident progression. Where Century Child leaves off, Once picks up. This is an overall excellent album, yet if you're just starting to discover the band, I would suggest getting some earlier albums of theirs first to see where theyre coming from (especially Oceanborn or Century Child. Maybe even Over the Hills and Far Away). But here is my review of the songs: <br /> <br />1) Dark Chest of Wonders - a good opening song, it pulls the listener in with its heavy riffs, orchestra, choir, and catchy lyrics. This songs sets the tone and theme for Once. <br /> <br />2) Wish I Had An Angel - the second single lifted from Once. Also scheduled to be in the movie Alone in the Dark (with Tara Reid). This song is reminiscent of \\"Lagoon\\" but much heavier with the incorporation of Marco. A bit different than other songs, especially with the techno beat, but it will reach a new audience. <br /> <br />3) Nemo - One of my favorite songs from the album. Not because it was the highly scessful 1st single, but because of its resemblence to \\"Ever Dream.\\" Its a classic old Nightwish-meets-heavier new Nightwish. This song is the link from Century Child to Once. <br /> <br />4) Planet Hell - I love Marco's voice on this track. It fits in well with Tarja's and the song sets a movie in the listeners mind. The song takes us on the Nightmarishjourney through Hell, and you can hear to fear and hopelessness in Tarja's voice. <br /> <br />5) Creek Mary's Blood - This song also plays a mental movie. With the Native American John Two-Hawks featured on this track, it tells of the epic struggle against Native Americans and the White Settlers. Highly Ironic, with Nightwish being from Finland, it also suggests that Americans should acknowledge their errors, and that even the European ancestors can realize this tragedy. <br /> <br />6) The Siren - Tuomas said the inspiration for this song came from the movie Sinbad, with its middle-eastern sounds. The middle of the song is an instrumental, and it is important not to think of it a \\"filler\\" to understand the deeper meaning <br /> <br />7) Dead Gardens - This song to me reminds me of an offshoot of the song \\"Away\\" (with the garden theme). To me, this song is the least \\"epic\\" sounding one, but it shows Tarja's singing, whispering, and Tuomas's riff-writing abilities. If you have patience, the deeper-meaning is also one that will be evident. <br /> <br />8) Romanticide - I love the name. Perhaps Nightwish's heaviest song to date, it has catchy-anger filled lyrics, angst-ridden whispers and \\"cry-like\\" vocals by Tarja, and Marco finds anger again like \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" <br /> <br />9) Ghost Love Score - A triumph of musical skills. It takes us on a journey to discover the bonds of love that cannot be broken. Filled with sorrow, death-wishes, hope, and faith, at 10:00 long, it seems its not long enough. with a chorus sung by a choir and Tarja echoning them, it is chilling. There are instrumental sounds in here that fill haunt yuo long after the song is over. <br /> <br />10) Death Makes An Artist - is the literal translation for this Finnish song. While many people complain that this ballad is to simple, and that it is terrible placement after Ghost Love Score, I disagree. After the climax and rage of Romanticide and the complex hope of Ghost Love Score, this song shows that simple songs can carry the most emotions - no matter what language its in <br /> <br />11) Higher than Hope - Marco's contribution to songwriting. It connects Angels Fall First with the ending of Once. It starts out with an acoustic-based Tarja singing about the sorrows of losing hope \\"Mother the pain aint hurting me...,\\" and then slams you with a duet with her and Marco the is cringing from the contrast (not in a bad way though). Like \\"Elvenpath\\" It incorporates sound clips. <br /> <br />12) White Night Fantasy - A fun song - though not Nightwish at its best. It works out well with Kuolema and Higher then Hope (because of the wind noises in those two songs). It is more of a fantasy piece, and there is so much happiness in Tarja's voice that its perky and uplifting. <br /> <br />This ablum is a great addition for any Nightwish fan, and it will take them far
B000002H33|5.0|now whoever calls this a disasterpiece instead of a masterpiece likes st.anger or slipknot.  either way its both terrible, how can u call this band horrible when slipknot has a song and dvd called \\"disasterpiece\\"?  ya well ill tell you something this isnt for kids 14 and under its for people who want to hear something thats actually metal and rocks out.  if u want to call this classic thats fine by me but if you want to call slipknot the world's greatest band then....i don't even want to get in to that.  so don't listen to the negative reviews and buy the damn cd.  you've had about 18 or so years to buy it go ahead and buy it now!
B00005JMUA|5.0|For those who feel that movies should imitate reality and want no form of entertaing un-realism put into your boring lives should stear clear of both Kill Bill Movies (and about 99% of all other movies as well).    Now for the rest of the people out there who know what a good movie is supposed to be get Both Kill Bill's or at least Volume 2.    Volume Two of what I consider Quentin Terrantino's greatest work to date.  Now I will give the raving Terrantino fans a second to breath again.  Here are my reasons for saying this:  First is the visual styling.  I am a huge fan of the high road to revenge type of movie.  This movie Delivered it in Spades.  It has everything in it to appeal to the eyes beutiful deserts, old temples of martial arts training, and of course the nicest house I have ever seen any person live in.  Plus there is not as much violence as in the first one but just enough to satify.  All these along with the actions and movements of the charecters makes this the most visualy appealing movie I have ever seen.    Now on to the diologue.  I have not every really thought of Terrantino as a very good writter of diologue. I mean he does have some good lines in his movies but all in all the lines in his movies seemed sub-par to the visual style he uses.  However, I was floored by how interesting and original his diologue sounded to me.  In fact Terrantino surprised me with Bill's monologue comparing the Bride to Superman.    I Love this movie because it really showed what Terrantino is really capible of.  it has all the elements that make a movie a classic in any of my books.  Memorable Characters you can eempathise with, Great Diologue all the way through, and above all else that visual style that has always set a place in my movie loving heart for Terrantino.    Get this movie it is a choice you will not regret.  But if you do you did not heed my warning at the begining.
B00005JMUA|1.0|I am lost for words. It surely says something hugely depressing about us that so many people should be so hugely impressed by this repulsive and tedious celebration of violence. Violence, Tarantino is unmistakeably saying, is cool, really really cool. With only the shallow tribalist caveat that when you turn it against your own folk (friends, lovers whatever), it is out of order and those you have turned over should then carve you to pieces with particular viciousness. Then there's some thought floating around his mind that the vileness of all this is somehow redeemed by a strain of outrageously hamfisted sentimentality injected towards the end and focused on the heroine's daughter. I can sort of understand why an adolescent boy might find all this enjoyable (And did you see the bit where she cut that man's head off and all the bood spurted out? Yea! Brilliant!(Or was that Volume One - who cares?)) and one does get a strong and persistent sense that, to all intents and purposes, an adolescent boy has made it. But as for anyone over about 15... Well, speaking for myself, by the end of it all, I just wanted a shower. <br /> <br />None of which is to deny that Tarantino exhibits real cinematic and visual flair. But, hey, I'm sorry, but so does Leni Riefenstahl. <br />
B00005JMX6|4.0|I basically just bought this movie because Elisha Cuthbrest was in it and she is one of the most gorgeous, freshest faces in Hollywood (in my mind) for quite some time. While my friends still eat up dime-a-dozen high-school and college comedies (as well as simplistic, style over substance action movies) I have begun to resent these types of movies as an actor myself. I now dissect every film's plots and acting much more than I ever did and much more than the average filmgoer, and it appalls me how people will flock to movies that basically tread on familiar, yet hard to point out, territory. The best years are definitely behind Hollywood until a whole new generation of fresh-thinking, visionary actors, directors, writers, and producers emerges. <br />Okay, this movie does cover a lot of familiar territory. Although I admit I liked it much more than I thought I would. Actually I was really into it but the ending seemed to be too convenient, and everything worked out too perfectly with some questions unanswered. In retrospect, I can point out a few flaws before the ending as well.  The acting performances are about as good as you're gonna get out of young, inexperienced actors, and the guy who played the porn producer Kelly, did a remarkable job I thought.  <br />There were only laughs occasionally (some really big ones at times), but I remember at one extended point in particular (the scene with Matthew and Kelly breaking into the house) where it didn't feel like a comedy at all. So this can be a good or a bad thing. The relationship between Matthew and Danielle was really underdeveloped I believe. He was so nervous around her, and then he kisses her at a party and next thing you know they're all lovey-dovey. She goes away to Las Vegas trying to forget him, and comes back to him and next thing you know lovey-dovey. You don't see any conversation or nothing explaining their feelings and changes of heart. Plus, Matthew never really declares that he loves Danielle, notDanielle the porn star. <br />Overall, I liked this film enough to watch it a few times. It may have been done before, but I like the idea of an innocent, all-work-no-play type of kid going out on a limb for the beautiful, living-life-too-fast-no-more type of girl. It just squeezes itself out of that dime-a-dozen comedy category. I prefer this mightily to those overrated, fantasized tales of the American Pie movies, Eurotrip, etc., etc. which are easy attempts to cash in on the ignorance and shallowness of the mainstream young moviegoer. I bet if you loved those movies, you will really like this one. <br />
B0000039PW|4.0|Notorious BIG on his first solo album, it's just another classic form the east coast. This is a very tight album, my favorites songs are machine gun funk, juicy, big poppa and unbelievable. Big definately made his mark on the world of hip hop with this. The only negative thig is Puffy, the worst producer ever, if biggie satyed with tupac and did not have the negative puffy influence it would have been much better, biggie is good but his label is bag, it's just like that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I would just be repeating all of the wonderful reviews if I went into detail, but I was hooked into this DVD before I ever saw the first episode. I had never heard of Firefly before July, 2004, as I was living in an area without access when it first appeared.  I was told about it by an online friend who worked as an extra in the upcoming movie, Serenity.  Ordered it sight unseen and have watched it three times already and am showing it to anyone who will sit still!  This is entertaining, character-driven sci-fi at it's best.  The posibilities are unlimited and we can only hope it's a long and productive franchise.
B000002WPI|5.0|Wu-tang, Wu-tang, Wu-tang, Wu-tang, Wu-tang, Wu-tang,. Wu-tang clan on their classic debut album. Wu-tang clan is the best rap group of the east coast and one of the best of all time. With songs like cream, protect ya neck, da mystery of chessboxin'and can it all be so simple, you know it's a classic. I like their kung-fu style, it's just original. Notihng is better then the whole crew member reunited, i checked solo albums of method man, rza, reakwon and nothing is better then enter the 36 chambers. The other albums of Wu-tang are good but this one is the greatest, it ain't nothing to f*** with !! WU-TANG WU-TANG WU-TANG WU-TANG
B000001GQY|5.0|I'm not a classical music expert, but I think that I know good music when I hear it, and this music is the best.  Brahms truly writes the most beautiful music ever, and these conciertos are filled with melodies that I found myself humming to myself during the day.  And the passionate piano playing is something that is very moving.  There is no music better.  Sure, you will find music as good, but this is at the top of my list.  Buy this CD if you want to experience the best.
B000075BFK|2.0|What the hell is this ? the production is bad, the originals are 10 times better... omg if 2pac knew this.. buy me against the world or all eyez on me if you want a album from the best rapper 2 pac
B00015HVI8|1.0|That's pretty much it.  I fell asleep for most of the episodes.  <br /> <br />Without Daniel Jackson, the show fell apart.  Boring, bland, plot holes you could drive that ugly spaceship through...yuck. <br /> <br />Save your money!  <br /> <br />(It's too bad you can't just order the episodes you want on one DVD.  Because with four episodes per disc, you could have Abyss, Changeling, the Maybourne episode and Full Circle (without the last five minutes) and not miss a thing from the end of season five to the beginning of season seven.) <br /> <br />
B00004YRQA|3.0|As far as a memory card goes it is great (it has alot of space so it is worth the money), but the ps2 should have gone the same route as the xbox and had a build-in memory card with the option of buying one for additional space (I have both system and despite the +20 games I have on there it is still at +50,000 space) so it is worth the money, but should have been optional instead of mandatory
0609610570|4.0|I was given the opportunity to read this book while consulting with a client who thought this book was the greatest book ever written.  Since I was going to be facilitating various breakout sessions, I had to not only read this book, but I had to study it.   <br /> <br />I like the information, and it provides some sound advice, but it repeats many times.  In addition, much of the book I felt like the authors were saying, \\"Look how great we are\\" I never like that approach when reading a book.  After all, consultants and trainers should be writing books to provide the reader with solutions to their problems, and not as a way to promote their practice.   <br /> <br />My recommendation is to pick up a used copy.  <br />
B0001611DI|1.0|This is a piece of crap. What the hell is everybody thinking? The zombies all look the same. The special effects aren't very special. The acting is terrible. Romero fails to tackle consumerism. How can this be a classic? <br /> <br />Now the start of the movie is just boring and pointless. Dozens of people in a news studio are just yelling and screaming endlessly. People are turning into zombies all around the world, and one man cares about nothing but his ratings. Just stupid. <br /> <br />It seems to me that the zombies in the movie were the worst done in any movie. The moved incredibly slow. Slower than Night, Resident Evil, and Day. They were uninteresting. They do not scare the audience. In fact, the viewers laugh at them through the entire movie. This movie is nothing more than a terrible comedy. <br /> <br />I didn't realize this movie had gore. I know it had pink liquid, but not gore. Then it had this stupid thing where the zombies were afraid of fire. ZOMBIES WOUlD NOT BE AFRAID OF FIRE!!! Romero just can't think of things that make sence. Whoever scored the movie did a terrible job. It was ridiculous. <br /> <br />Let's ask god to strike Romero down before he finishes his fourth dead film. His first three were crap and complete failures that hardly made money. What makes him think his fourth one will do good?
B00007AJGH|5.0|The Story of a Man, a Woman and a Rabbit in a triangle of trouble. The 1988 looney blockbuster classic starring Bob Hoskins as drunk Private Eye Eddie Valiant, Christopher Lloyd as sinister Judge Doom,Kathleen Turner as the voice of Roger's knockout wife Jessica and Charles Fleischer as the voice of the title character Roger Rabbit. The First ever animation and live action combined movie. in 1947 Hollywood the story of Maroon Cartoon Star Roger Rabbit, a toon rabbit who acts for Maroon Studios,owned by R.K. Maroon and who framed for murder of toontown owner Marvin Acme by sinister Judge Doom. The Only Man who can help Roger is Private Eye Eddie Valiant, a drinking man who hasn't help a toon since a toon killed his brother. Eddie protects Roger from Judge Doom and his toon weasels, Judge Doom is out for Roger and to get his hands on Toontown. This film is one of the greatest technological achievements in film history,imaginative,brilliant,incredible and funny, Two Big Thumbs way up. the Best movie of 1988, one of the best of the decade and the 20th century. Roger and Jessica is the best toons since Mickey,Bugs and Bettie Boop. This is a great two disc DVD with lots of looney features. this film created Cool World and Space Jam, and it's best of it's kind. It's imaginative how in our world toons are lined drawings that move and that we like believe are real, in this world their living walking talking lifeforms. I recommend this so you can see how animation and live action pregressed since Mary Poppins and Bednobs and broomsticks. bring Roger home and hide your DVD from the weasels if they're looking for it. Hide Me Eddie plea-Please, I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I have been playing the game since I was eight years old, and I hoped they would make it into a movie quickly. When they did, I had to see it the very day it premiered. Back then, I thought it was the greatest zombie movie ever made.(Dawn of the Dead 2004 stole that title) <br /> <br />It wasn't much like the video game, but it was good. I wasn't expecting it to be good. It was low budget, and the trailer was just an unorganized mess. But I was wrong. It was a great film, and had one of my favorite scenes in movie history. The laser scene.  <br /> <br />I'm glad they fired that idiot Romero from this movie. I've read his script. You can tell that he's never played the game before they hired him to do the movie. He based his script off the first Resident Evil game, and he ruined it. Chris had eagle friends? Jill left for the mansion first? Rebecca was always with Chris? No!!! He ruined the whole thing, and his style of zombies is pathetic. <br /> <br />Paul Anderson did a great job with this movie. People call him a bad director. I've yet to see a movie he's done that was bad. Can somebody tell me what movie is so horrible that nobody likes him? <br /> <br />Although the zombies weren't fast, they did make fierce and vicious sounds. I liked that. <br /> <br />So this turns out to be a good movie. Better than anything Romero made.
0451209338|5.0|I just finished my first book by Daniel Silva, The Kill Artist.  It was the BEST book I have read in years!  I could not put it down and was sorry when it was finished.  The female lead (Sarah/Jacqueline/Dominique) reminded me so much of Charlie in Le Carre's Little Drummer Girl, in the way she was deceived and led to do things by duplicitous men.  I am now starting The Confessor and hope it is even half as good.  I plan to get all his books.  So thankful there is another writer whose thriller/spy novels I can look forward to getting my hands on (like Ludlum, Forsythe, Follet, etc.).
B000007SPT|5.0|This album is more beautiful than anything I've ever heard. I never actually cry when I listen to this, but I cry on the inside... My favorite track on the album is Dreams Made Flesh. It's a haunting otherworldly track that I can't help but listen to a few times in a row. Buy this album.
B00005JN2F|5.0|First of all, I like Matt Damon. He fits a certain role, it seems to me. He wouldn't do well in a suave role. He's Len Deighton's Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File, not Ian Fleming's Bond. And if the truth be known, brilliant actor that he is, I never saw Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne. But I do see Matt Damon. Muscled, confused, haunted. Reactionary. Bi and tri lingual. Maybe not highly intelligent but terribly well skilled in the art of killing. That's what Ludlum had him do. That was his raison d'etre. Killing.<br /><br />So here he's living like a recluse and the past reaches out and grabs him. The movie has a serene beginning, but after a few minutes of plant scenes, it's non stop action. Julia Stiles steals the show for the small time she's on film. We deserve to see more of her. And Joan Allen plays her part well as the woman manager-operative left with the mess of Treadstone.<br /><br />Can't wait for the third of the trilogy. Hope they keep Damon in it. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B00005JNEI|5.0|People who have said this movie is \\"pro-terrorist\\" and is full of lies are just Bush-lovers who have no idea what they're talking about. I don't understand how anyone can like this man after all the things he's gotten us into. This movie furthers my hate of him. It makes some very good points, some may not be supported by very much evidence, but they don't have any evidence against them either. Peace.
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is a really funny movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect but I really enjoyed it.  Its different than the American Pie movies, but still good in a different way.
0974153001|5.0|<br />This is a great book by Katherine Dewey, definately an improvement on her first and I can't wait to get into trying the models in her book. <br /> <br />It would be most helpful to anyone with a basic knowledge in art, sculpting and polymer clay, but anyone will benefit from reading and practicing. <br /> <br />I love Katherines sculptures, she's a talented lady and the right person to be producing a book like this.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Why does Santana do it?  Because!  It's all about the music... and this fine collection speaks volumes!
0891349553|4.0|<br />This book is great for anyone interested in sculpting with polymer clay.  <br />Katherine Deweys instructions are fairly easy to follow, the only thing that confused me was that you sometimes can't tell from the photos, which way she's holding the clay. (So you're not sure where to place your appliques). <br />None the less it is a great book for beginners and amateurs alike, and I would definately recommend it. <br />I would have liked to see some basic patterns for some different animals, perhaps some more common in other parts of the world, seeing as we don't really get any of those specific animals here in Australia. (I wanted to make a dog!)
B000089CJI|1.0|Wow! I dont mind Death Cab for Cutie that much, but that doesn't mean that I will force myself to like all of the crap that is created by any band member.<br /><br />If i wanted to hear \\"experimental\\" souds with electronic edge, I would listen to the masters, not some suckass wannabe supergroup.  You want some \\"breakbeat\\" sounds? You want electronica and noise? Try  Beck's  \\"Odelay\\" or \\"Midnite Vultures\\"<br /><br />If you admire this ablum's \\"daring\\" sound, try listening to EVERY OTHER BAND THAT HAS DONE THIS BEFORE! (note: the other bands did it  much, much better too!) Broken Social Scene, Sonic Youth, the Flaming Lips.<br /><br />Catchy choruses and Death Cab appeal can't save this album from one simple fact: it is terrible music.
B0000640VO|5.0|Good heavens, what a delightful movie! Rarely does a film manage to charm me completely, but this one does it with charm to spare. I'll keep this review brief, because there is a plot synopsis right above it, but I strongly urge you to buy 'Amelie'. In a time when, ha, \\"films\\" like 'XXX' and 'White Chicks' are prevalent, this delicious piece of cinema is a breath of sweet, fresh air.
B00008OLYN|5.0|well you could go through all the dunces in here putting their moronic cents in it and not say anything about the music other than \\"duhhrrrr it is progressive like floyd\\" or \\"duhhrrrr it isn't metal\\"  that  isn't what the album's intention is, now it is a known fact that steve wilson (keyboardist to porcupine tree) produced this album, and that opeth are porcupine tree fans obviously those factors would have an influence, i say this to keep it short,  listen to the previews or go to best buy and listen to it,  i think it is safe to say it is worth the price of the cd.  reviews are not a good indicator of what you should buy, first of all they're not technical, and you shouldn't buy or not buy something based on the opinions of others.  i say this to anyone who wants to checkout the cd, is go click on the clips on this page and i think [...] has some mp3's from the album on it.
B000002H33|5.0|Unbelievable album, amazing riffs.  This was Metallica in their prime, mid 80's, still with Cliff Burton.  This was Cliff's last album, and it kinda makes you wonder where Metallica would be today if Cliff was still with Metallica.  Anyway, amazing album, classic thrash metal!
B000002H33|4.0|If you don't own this album you should if your a metal fan. This is my second fav Metallica album. Ride the Lightning is my fav and that CD is also mandatory for any Metallica fan that doesn't own. Puppets is great on so many levels the subject matter of each song, the amazing guitar work done by James and Kirk, bass solos in Orion, and the second best drummer in the business Lars Ulrich. This album is a masterpiece each and every song is freaking awesome and deserve a listen at least once and trust me this album is worth it get it new if you can. If you come across teh Gold version of this disc get it cause you probably wont see it again. I have the standard 1995 remaster of this album and it sounds just fine since i havent heard the Gold edition. Have a great day and go out and pick up this album plus get Kill em all, Ride the Lightning, Black album, and And Justice for All. Dont waste your time with new Metallica unless you absolutely have to have every album by this awesome band.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have seen the changes, and I like 'em. I like them very much.  <br />Jabba looks much better than the 1997 SE version. Han's reaction to Greedo is much better, as well the 'Yes' restored to his dialogue. Luke no longer screams falling down the shaft in Empire. And Ian McDiarmid in Empire works very well. ILM have done wonders with the changes, and the remastered picture makes the previous SE efforts seem very half arsed.  <br />I'm very much looking forward to owning this boxset.
B0000039QA|5.0|Note that with the following comments, I'm not starting any arguements, just showing my opinion.  Here's a quote: <br /> <br />\\"Reviewer: ToxicTearyEyes (Lawndale, Ca) - See all my reviews <br />Biggie Smalls, A (very) BIG man with a (very) SMALL amount of talent. nuff said.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Now, personally, I havn't heard this album, but I have heard a lot of Biggie, and I know that there are a few things in hip-hop that are known for a fact.  One of them is that Biggie Smalls is one of the greatest rappers ever.  If you say he has no talent, then I want you to write a review that contains the lyrics to a rap song you wrote that is better then this in terms of lyricism, multisylabble rhyming, metaphores, ect.  To anyone who says that any rapper except for RBX has no talent, same thing.  Don't hate if you can't prove your words.  A man with no talent in rap should be able to be beaten by anybody, including our friend the reviewer who's review I quoted.  Like I said, not starting anything, just sharing an opinion.
0064409422|5.0|Wow! This is truly an amazing book! For those who have read it before, this illustrated version is a must-see! And for those who have never read it, I hope this is an encouraging review. This story of 4 siblings and their relationships as they \\"accidentally\\" discover an other world is a true moral tale. In its fullness, this is a tale of the boundlessness of real love and all that that means. Within that setting, it's a story of betrayal and the opportunity for change; and also forgiveness and its contribution to that change and the healing that occurs for everyone. This is a story that is completely appropriate for any age and one that hopefully will cause disturbance in the heart of the reader - enough to ask questions and discussion for a family. It's a wonderful adventure!
B00005JN2X|4.0|I admire several of director Michael Mann's earlier works, notably Thief (1981), Heat (1995), Manhunter (1986), The Last of the Mohicans (1992), and Ali (2001). What we have in this film is perhaps the best example of Mann's style: Multiple camera angles, leisurely conversations juxtaposed with high-speed action, ethically and/or morally ambiguous lead (usually male) characters, and music which is seamlessly integrated within an unhurried plot. It is twilight in Los Angeles as Max (Jamie Foxx) carefully prepares his cab for another evening. Two fares of note: a prosecuting attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) with whom Max almost immediately develops a mutual attraction and then an-assassin-for-hire named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who retains Max for the entire evening. For the next several hours, Max provides the transportation which Vincent needs to complete a series of five hits for his client, a major drug organization which needs to have four witnesses eliminated. As for the fifth person on the hit list....<br /><br />As I observed the development of the story line, certain elements in it reminded me of the earlier Mann films but also of Chinatown (1974) , Pulp Fiction (1994), and L.A. Confidential (1997). For example, its noir elements; also its engagement of the viewer to feel like an eavesdropper, if not a voyeur. Almost all of Collateral was shot at night and much of the city revealed may be unfamiliar to those who actually live there. Killing people is what Vincent does. I would rank his skills somewhere between those of Edward Fox's \\"Jackal\\" and John Travolta's Vincent Vega. It is Foxx (not Cruise), however, who is the film's emotional center of gravity. Mann brilliantly establishes this during Max's conversation with Annie, a cab scene I consider to be at least the equal of Brando and Steiger's in On the Waterfront.<br /><br />Given all that, why not a higher rating? Good question. In fairness to Mann and his associates as well as to those who read this brief commentary, I want to be very careful when answering that question. I don't reveal too much when suggesting that several situations in this film are distractingly implausible. Mann is a master of portraying gritty realism. In this film, he sometimes wanders across the line into areas more appropriate to, for example, The Matrix (1999) or an earlier Cruise film, Minority Report (2002).

I don't reveal too much when suggesting that several situations in this film are distractingly implausible. Mann is a master of portraying gritty realism. In this film, he sometimes wanders across the line into areas more appropriate to, for example, The Matrix (1999) or an earlier Cruise film, Minority Report (2002).

B0001AP12G|5.0|I love the whole album. Can't get enough of it. Kanye is definetly the man.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This was by far my favorite movie of the year, and one of my top favorites ever.  It is an engaging story and well acted.  I tend to like movies that tell a good interesting story, and this one does exactly that.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I have to say that this was one of the most entertaining anime movies i've watched. I was fooled by the shady opening scenes, but there after, the story seemed to be more interesting. The story of a girl, Sen, as she is named in the spirit world, and her parents, barged in and started eating up all the food, then as the sun was setting, they were meant to leave before they change into pigs, but because they were hypnotized by the appetizing food, they stayed, then turing into pigs. Now Sen has to rescue her parents and change them back before the Spirit World figures out she's a human and kill her.<br /><br />There are lots of colorful, weird and supporting characters in this first ever Oscar winning anime, and the way this anime was presented, with it's out of this world animation and great voice overs, it's the only anime worth watching, trust me!
B00005JMX6|3.0|All right. This movie has some good moments in it, but it had some fundamental problems, the main one being that it couldn't decide what it wanted to be and it never truly captures the emotions intended.<br /><br />Was it a comedy? yes. Was it a drama about a girl who needed to be saved from the porn business? yes.<br /><br />There are some great moments in similar movies like RISKY BUSINESS and THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN, that manage to transform from comedy to drama AND THEY WORK!!! Is it the realism? Is it the direction? Is it the actors? Probaby a combination, but something is wrong with THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.<br /><br />Bottom line. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is not all that great of a movie. The storyline is good, but not completely achieved. The comedy is okay, but never much better than that. The movie is about porn stars but not all that dirty.<br /><br />On the flip side... Elisha Cuthbert is drool inspiring, but her performance is hindered because she never really did anything all that dirty... so, the only reason I thought she was a porn star was because they told us she was.<br /><br />THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is just another movie in a long series of movies these days that don't really have the guts to be TRUE TO ITS SUBJECT.<br /><br />Boaz Davidson pushed the envelope with THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN and made a cult classic that was RISKY at the time to make. Amy Heckerling made a name for herself with a pull no punches movie named FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and Tom Cruise became a star in the smash hit RISKY BUSINESS.<br /><br />THE GIRL NEXT DOOR didn't really do anything. It missed opportunities to be poigniant and risky, and unfortunately is just another movie that will most likely be forgotten after a couple of weeks on the video store shelf.
B00005JMX6|5.0|I'm not sure how those of us who were lucky enough to see this movie in theatres actually ^got^ to see it in theatres.  Reportedly grossing less than twenty mil during its quick run early this year, and attacked from several angles by self-indulgent critics, this wasn't a movie many people went to see because of its promotion in the media.  But instead, somehow, people saw it, and those who did stood by it with an almost unanimous verdict -- the juice was worth the squeeze.  I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where I laughed this hard, yet actually cared about the well-being of the characters, and worried as to how they'd end up in the end.  Eli and Elisha played their roles beautifully, balancing a mixture of awkwardness with the daring of youth, and a smooth sophistication in certain scenes that just made you smile when you saw them on screen.  Some parts of the movie were incredibly touching, while others were somewhere between hilarious and simply crazy - crazy in a good way.  Crazy in the best of ways.  I'm actually going to get the DVD for my older sister, who wasn't able to see the film while it was in theatres, because that's how much faith I have in the movie to make anyone smile.  I mean, look at the ratings here on Amazon.  When last did you see a teen comedy get a 4+ out of 5-star rating on Amazon?  As someone put it earlier, we can't all be wrong.  Look through the reveiews -- the vast majority are fours and fives, and well-written to boot.  This movie actually touched people -- it left an impact with them, to the level that they'd come on an online store to write about what it meant to them -- even though only 1 person saw it for every *20* that saw Spiderman II.  That's dedication.  That's the sign of something different, something deeper than the average.  To me at least, that's the sign of a cult classic in the making. <br /> <br />Go see it.  I can't promise you'll absolutely love it, but I almost can.  It's that good :^)
B000062YAZ|5.0|When I was looking at all of the reviews he wrote, I noticed that he thought that linkin park, korn, marylin manson and other rubish like that was metal! Well you are wrong! These guys are classic thrash metal, sure they are commercial sell outs, (well aren't most thrash bands?) they still make some quality thrash metal. Sure I don't really like thrash that much any more but Slayer's Angel of Death is easily my favourite thrash song. The album as a whole is great too. If any of you people see this in the shops, do not hesitate to buy it. Just pick it up and buy it. Great bloody album!
0553801546|5.0|I have read all of the Farseer and Tawny Man triolgies and I must admit that I have become fully absorbed in Fitz's world. I truly can visualize Buckkeep Castle, the Eldering city, and Chade's old workroom. I feel like I know Fitz and his world better than I know mine or my close friends. That is truly a talent that Robin Hobb has that I have not found matched in any other fantasy triolgy I have read. <br />Excellent work, and many times I cried when I thought certain events (no spoilers, here :) ) were going to occur. To be moved like that by a book is no small feat. Congrats again to Robin Hobb on a superb six books!! I'm off now to give her MadShip series a try :)
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris has a voice like no other. His observations seem random but somehow produce compelling autobiography on its own idiosyncratic terms, even if it isn't a straight-through chronology of his life. This book moves quickly through signposts in his life, as he evolves from an effeminate boy with a lisp...to a guitar-strumming college dropout...to an aimless writing teacher in Chicago...to a self-proclaimed no-talent performance artist...to an American living abroad with his partner Hugh in France. What ties these different stages together is his constant sense of the absurd and an acute ability to include himself in that world, not as an observer but as someone who creates an existence that is simultaneously at odds with yet strangely compatible with the world around him. Sedaris seems as much an eccentric as everyone else in the book, especially compared to his family, even compared to his deliciously wacky sister Amy, but he still stands out as a character without alienating the reader, no mean feat. Sedaris does not use cheap sentiment, and I like how he takes me on his journeys no matter how bumpy.<br /><br />The second half of this book focuses on his adventures settling into the Gallic world, where his boyfriend owns an 18th century house in the French countryside. Sedaris does not take the easy way out by ridiculing the French but hilariously describes the quixotic nature of language barriers. The chapter, \\"Jesus Saves\\", is a great illustration of how he captures the quirkiness that befalls all sorts of international students trying to make sense of the French language on their terms by having everyone explain what Easter is.<br /><br />But I have to say my favorite section is earlier on when he discusses his succession of pets and the sadness he felt when someone brought up \\"euthanasia\\" for his aged cat Neil, in the aptly named chapter, \\"The Youth in Asia\\". Sedaris brings up a cherished memory for me by remembering \\"Fatty and Skinny\\", the Japanese movie that showed up periodically on Saturday mornings with Kukla, Fran and Ollie in the sixties. His vivid recollection of this movie completely embraces me, as his memories match mine completely, especially when Fatty climbs the pole to the cruel taunts of his schoolmates and then cries out his friend's name for forgiveness of his failure, \\"Komatsuuuuuuuuuu!\\". I had the privilege of meeting David Sedaris at a book signing this past summer where I could share this with him, and so in my copy of this book, he signed.... \\"Komatsuuuuuuuuuu!\\" How funny and dear this man is, and what a wonderful read this book  is.p periodically on Saturday mornings with Kukla, Fran and Ollie in the sixties.

B000000OXH|4.0|Asia's sophomore album arrived in July 1983. This was quite a fast production, considering that their previous album had only come out in April of 1982, which was then followed by months and months of touring.<br /><br />Bassist/vocalist John Wetton and keyboardist Geoff Downes had emerged as the main songwriting duo behind Asia. As a result, every song on here (as opposed to Asia's debut) is purely a Wetton/Downes credit. And I think this is one reason why it's not as universally-accepted as the debut album. Vocals and keyboards are a bit more dominant, Carl Palmer's drums aren't mixed as well...and where's Steve Howe? His guitars are a thin whisper on many of the tracks. His sole songwriting contribution to Alpha was \\"Lying To Yourself\\" and it was filed away to be issued as a B-side. No wonder he left in '84.<br /><br />It's not that I think Alpha is a bad album. In fact, it's quite stunning. It's just that it's more of the same, but not nearly as good. It repeats itself too much, and doesn't feel like a band effort. Too much money was up in the air and Asia had become too successful, too fast. Everyone had cabin fever when they wrote it, and egos were starting to clash within the group (mostly with Howe and Wetton, who's rift broke up the original group for 23 years.) Mix this in with huge arenas that had thousands of empty seats, as well as growing Euro-pop trends, and Asia -- and other hard rock bands -- were in trouble.<br /><br />\\"Don't Cry\\" starts off the album positively. Very nice vocals and some good drumming from Palmer. It's a pretty standard pop song, and it was the first Asia tune I ever heard. This song absolutely soars, and is incredibly uplifting.<br /><br />\\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\" is a pretty little ballad driven by keyboards and vocals, and is solely credited to John Wetton. This was written in 1982, along with \\"Midnight Sun\\" -- both of which were played on the previous tour in different form. I think that the song turned out better in later years, played live and with a real piano sound as opposed to the Casio-sounding keyboards on this studio version.<br /><br />\\"Never In A Million Years\\" gets things rocking and the album starts to pick up some steam. Awesome vocals and some great keyboards, especially during the second verse. One wonders how much better this song had been with it's original intro, chopped off at the suggestion of a record executive because it \\"Made the song too long and less commercial.\\"<br /><br />\\"My Own Time (I'll Do What I Want)\\" is an amazing song. It begins with a bombastic fanfare and then quietly fades in with Wetton's distinctive smoky vocals coupled with some beautiful acoustic guitar from Howe. The song builds and builds, Wetton's singing just dripping with emotion and fire. Palmer's drumming is another highlight here, in addition to the short little keyboard \\"trumpets\\" that Downes plays as the song fades out.<br /><br />\\"The Heat Goes On\\" is often considered (along with \\"Open Your Eyes\\") to be the best song on Alpha. I won't go into too much detail, but everyone involved is at the top of their game in what is basically a straightforward classic rock tune. Play this loudly and people will likely ask who it is. A shame it gets no radio play. \\"The Heat Goes On\\" was originally titled \\"Eye of the Hurricane\\", but the lyrics were changed to basically make it a sequel to \\"Heat of the Moment\\". I would have preferred the original lyrics. (After the success of HotM, it struck me as kinda lame that they were trying to remind people of their biggest hit.)<br /><br />\\"Eye To Eye\\" is where the album starts to get a little slow. This song is very good, but gets a little repetitive, even as short as it is at three minutes or so. I *love* the keyboards though. Very icy-sounding, perfectly mirroring the lyrics and vocals. There's some wonderful instrumental pieces in here, subtly recalling Howe and Downes' 1980 Drama album under the Yes banner.<br /><br />\\"The Last To Know\\" used to be myleast-favorite song on Alpha but I enjoy it more these days. It's just that the lyrics are extremely sappy for guys in their 30's, and aside from when I remember myself at 13 in junior high, I can't relate. Nice classical interlude, though -- especially Palmer's drumming.<br /><br />I used to love \\"True Colors\\" when I first got Alpha... now it's my least-favorite. It just repeats the chorus over and over. Still good, but too keyboard-driven -- even if the darker sound does seem pretty cool.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Sun\\" used to not really do anything for me, but I grew to really enjoy it. Don't ask me how that happens. It's probably the most non-Asia-sounding song on Alpha, and one that Yes fans would probably dig on the most (Downes keyboards are a lot like the ones on Drama...the use of the Fairlight Excalibur really recalls that album.) The lyrics are very Sci-Fi, and whenever I hear it, I imagine a darkened red moon rising over a massive cityscape of Neo-Tokyo, straight out of some 80's anime movie.<br /><br />Alpha closes with \\"Open Your Eyes\\", a powerful lament for an Asian girl seeking fame and fortune in America. Thankfully, as on \\"The Heat Goes On\\", everybody overcomes the other pitfalls of Alpha and really shines forth as they did in '82. The lyrics are damn good, and I love the use of a vocoder during the intro and outro (as well as Howe's electric sitar, not used since \\"Close To The Edge\\" in '72!) As the song gets quiet and then thunders back for an ecstatic rush of an ending, I always get chills. Superb ending.<br /><br />If you love Asia's first album, by all means, get this. Chances are, you'll like it. In fact, a small minority regard it as better. You can make it even better by making a CD-R (or MP3 playlist) and adding the two B-sides, \\"Lying To Yourself\\" (goes good after \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\") and \\"Daylight\\" (a stunningly powerful and underrated Asia song) as an album-closer.<br /><br />I do hope that Geffen rereleases and repackages this someday. Especially because there's a lot more material which didn't make it -- the earlier versions of \\"The Heat Goes On\\" and \\"Never In A Million Years\\", as well as two previously-unreleased songs in \\"Jodi\\" and \\"Keep The Love Alive\\".<br /><br />As much as I love this album, I can only give it 3 stars. It loses one for the lyrics (not bad, but overall worse than the debut) and one for production (again, worse than the debut.)<br /><br />Ironically, one of Alpha's best features is Roger Dean's breathtaking cover art, which I would say is among one of his best works. In an odd juxtaposition, we see a Sci-Fi utopia of a pyramid and arcologies set amongst an exotic jungle. An eagle (representing freedom) flies overhead, joyful in the bright blue skies. Underneath the brush lay hidden black tigers peering between the leaves, representing an inner darkness. As a strange synchronicity, we see large blocky moth statues at the edges of the jungle, and if we look closely at the jungle leaves, the exact same moth lay perched...is it the architectural hand of God who sets events in motion? Maybe I read too much into it, but I tend to get lost in Roger Dean's worlds...<br /><br />3 stars + 1 for an emotional connectionthat the lyrics are extremely sappy for guys in their 30's, and aside from when I remember myself at 13 in junior high, I can't relate.

B000000OMB|4.0|If you're into all kinds of music, especially classic rock, and love hooks and melodies without real concern for lyrics, or you don't get hung up on small things (of any sort), and are perhaps under the age of 35, chances are, you'll love this album. If you're over 35, cranky, egotistical, and demand only the most virtuoso Math-rock from your musicians (early Yes, King Crimson), you might not like this album.<br /><br />You see, Asia was all about having fun. The lyrics were sappy, the playing short, tight, consise and very poppy. So don't expect to hear anything like King Crimson, ELP, or Yes. You'll hear ever-so-slight influences of the band member's previous groups, but nothing substantial.<br /><br />Speaking of the band...Wetton never sounded better than on Asia's debut. With King Crimson, his voice always sounded hollow and grainy to me. He got better as time went on. Steve Howe's guitar playing was still excellent, and coupled with Geoff Downes on keyboards (who was in the previous Yes line-up with Howe) there are some moments that recall their Drama album from 1980. Carl Palmer on drums sounded excellent as well.<br /><br />\\"Heat of the Moment\\" sets the tone for the record by kicking things off with a bang. This was a huge radio and MTV hit in 1982, and you'll likely hear this on classic rock radio today. Listen to this song five times and I dare you to get that chorus out of your head. It can't be done. The middle instrumental section is breathtaking.<br /><br />\\"Only Time Will Tell\\" is perhaps the best song on here. The keyboards and piano are beautiful, and I love the production on Wetton's voice. The quiet build-up to that first chorus, and the \\"whoooosh\\" of Palmer's drum that sounds like a tidal wave is what hooked me to this.<br /><br />\\"Sole Survivor\\" is powerful, straight-ahead arena rock. Another catchy chorus, and it features some excellent Hammond organ playing from Downes. The interlude and build-up, again, is gut-wrenching. As the song fades out, the band just keeps going. I have never heard Palmer or Howe sound more alive in a basic rock 'n' roll fashion than they are in this outro.<br /><br />\\"One Step Closer\\" is the album's one true weak point. Steve Howe is higher in the vocal mix during the verses (Eh?), and the lyrics are pretty bad. However, I can say that it's a very original song...I've never heard anything like it really, and it has some nice little jingly keyboards on the verses. If it wasn't for this merely-okay song, my rating might have gone up a notch.<br /><br />\\"Time Again\\". Wow. Heavy guitar opening into an echoey, eerie vocal intro and a gong, which segues into some fierce playing by all around. One of the best, and a killer concert opener. Even though almost all vocals are Wetton on the album (including overdubbed background singing) the layered sections really sound good. Check out those dissonant piano/guitar shots traded back and forth by Howe and Downes that follow each chorus.<br /><br />\\"Wildest Dreams\\" is the band's take on war and the horrors surrounding it. It uses various lyrical imagery to recall all of the various wars throughout humanity's collective history. This song contains perhaps Steve Howe's fastest, most intricate solo of all time, as well as a snappy, rhythmic drum solo from Carl Palmer.<br /><br />\\"Without You\\", along with the previous track, are Asia's best lyrics on the album. This song is very melancholy and dramatic. Lots of lovely keyboards, and Wetton's smoky vocals on the first verse are haunting. The song starts slow and builds up to a fast-paced middle section before Howe gives a blazing, powerful solo and brings the song to an end ever so slowly with some tasteful acoustic guitar. Then you're treated to one last chorus before the song fades over a keyboard-driven march.<br /><br />\\"Cutting It Fine\\" begins with Howe playing the main melody on his acoustic -- then Downes plays it as a keyboard line -- and then everyone joins in as we're led into the song,this time with a lot of venom in the lyrics and vocal phrasing. Take note of Geoff's vocoder during the choruses near the end (it took me many listens to notice it) -- \\"Cut...Ing...It...Fine.\\" The song seems to fade out for good...<br /><br />...Before we're treated to what is essentially a Downes solo piece. It starts slow, on a piano, and then adds layers and layers of keyboard textures and distant drums, creating this grand march that seems to never end as it fades out. One of the most poignant and beautiful moments on the album. The actual title of this section is \\"Bolero\\". Geoff Downes still plays a version of this during his solo spots on Asia tours today.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes The Feeling\\" ends Asia's debut record on a positive note, as the lyrical protagonist is reunited with his lover and all is well with the world. The instrumental bridge is the best jam-like moment the original Asia line-up ever had, and is my favorite part of the song.<br /><br />Over the years, many people have slammed this album. I don't understand why. For what it is and what it tries to be, it's perfect. It's NOT a serious rock record. It's just fun, emotional, raw prog-pop, served up early 80's style. Back in the day, one critic mentioned (paraphrasing) \\"The lyrics make no sense. Five songs about wanting to break up with their girlfriends, and three about how much they love them.\\" The way I see it, that's the point! The album is like a series of snapshots of all the relationships I once had, both good and bad memories, and it came upon me at the perfect age in the late 90's, when I was almost 18 years old. It satisfied my itch for harmony vocals and catchy choruses in a pop format (I was a big fan of 80's Rush and Yes), as well as having the instrumental intricacy that I loved from Yes and ELP.<br /><br />If you have a CD burner, tack on the B-side \\"Ride Easy\\". It makes a good album-closer. Also, here's hoping that Geffen will remaster and repackage this sometime soon. The booklet needs lyrics and some photos. By the way, the cover art is among Roger Dean's best; the Chinese dragon rising like a phoenix from the waters, ever-chasing the golden orb of knowledge.<br /><br />When I listen to this perfect musical stew of incredible hooks, harmony choruses and chunky keyboard and guitar riffs, I close my eyes and see all of the imagery associated with Asia (the continent)...dreamlike imagery of dragons, mysterious Japanese geisha, Buddhist temples hidden in deep forests, giant robot mechs battling it out, 80's Nintendo game soundtracks, and sprawling Neo-Tokyo anime cityscapes. In other words, all the cliches of Asia that an American boy will absorb having grown up in the last thirty years.<br /><br />I was 2 years old when \\"Heat of the Moment\\" hit the radio waves, yet it's ironic that I would become such a massive fan later. I could tell you dozens of stories related to each song...they were the soundtrack to my life throughout the last several years, providing inspiration and empathy through breakups, ecstatic reunions, leaving home for the first time, depression and darkness, and then eventually back to a joy for life and a spiritual renewal.<br /><br />I actually can't listen to this album very much these days, because I played it literally hundreds of times, and I seriously burned out on it for awhile.

Yes kids, you can overplay your favorite CDs.    3 stars for casual rock/AOR/prog fans + 2 more for the emotional connection it gave me
0790733226|1.0|The ending to this movie really makes you feel that you wasted a few hours of your life.  I cant even think of a worse ending that they possibly couldve done, its like the writers tried to make up the worst ending imaginable
B00006879E|5.0|\\"Harder To Breathe\\", the first single, made me originally buy this CD, and I hated it. I thought every song was too fixated on sex (videos too, like This Love and She Will Be Loved), so I decided to put it away somewhere. I forget where I put it, so I downloaded it again on iTunes because I heard someone playing the music (I think that \\"The Sun\\" was the song that was playing) and I thought \\"Wow... I was wrong\\".     Indeed I was wrong. Maroon 5 is not just a pop, boy-band outfit but more of a rock and soul mix. I only wish every song was like \\"Harder To Breathe\\", (10/10)the album opener, because it has a harder edge than every other song.      The second track, \\"This Love\\" (8/10) was the second single and was a much bigger hit than HTB was, although I didn't like it nearly as much. Like many other songs, the chorus is the standout.     The next song \\"Shiver\\" (7/10) is my least favorite, because Adam Levine's high-pitched vocals are annoying and the song sounds a little too rushed during the verses.      The third single taken from the album was \\"She Will Be Loved\\" (10/10), a ballad about a current relationship with a troubled girl. The last few notes \\"Please don't try so hard to say goodbye\\" are my favorite parts of the song, which is a highlight.     The fifth and sixth tracks are \\"Tangled\\" (9/10) and \\"The Sun\\"(10/10). The reason I place the two together are because both are incredibly similar, with the melody and those beginning beats. The former is a funky soul number with nothing special. The latter which is even better (which is without a doubt the best song on the album) is the same, with an interesting chorus which is a notch above the rest of the song.   \\"  Must Get Out\\" (7/10) is a fan favorite, but I never liked it that much. Moving right along to the next song, there's what's to be the fourth single, \\"Sunday Morning\\" (10/10). It's my favorite right after \\"The Sun\\". What's similar is they both have a jazzy feel to it. I think Maroon 5 are particularly goodat doing jazz numbers.      Track 9, \\"Secret\\" (8/10) is a very odd song. First, there's a 45 second intro and for another 45 seconds the song is backed up with acoustic guitars. The lead singer's voice seems hushed and relaxed, which comes in handy for the angry shouting in \\"Through With You\\" (10/10).     \\"Through With You\\" is my third favorite from the disc. Like the next song, \\"Not Coming Home\\" (9/10) it's another break-up 'I hate my ex' song'. But unlike \\"Through With You\\", \\"Not Coming Home\\" seems to be performed live.     The album closes with \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" (7/10) which is my second least favorite. I dunno, I just skip over it, and it's not the best closer.     Well, Maroon 5 are definitely better than your normal band. If you like them, check out Yellowcard if you don't like them already.
B00015HVI8|3.0|I'm a purist. I don't apologize for that. For me the sixth season of Stargate wasn't Stargate SG1. I own three disks containing the episodes Abyss, Changeling, and Full Circle. The team of SG1 isn't a team without the four characters of Jack, Daniel, Teal'c, and Sam. Season six failed to capture my interest with the rebuild of the team. There simply wasn't any chemistry to get me past the weaker episodes or to allow me to ignore the hole where Daniel belonged. The hammer to the head push of the new character just made things worse. So, for me, season six consists of three episodes where SG1 was all present and accounted for.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is without a doubt one of the most well crafted & thought provoking film of our time. While there has been over thousand reviews written about it, each with its own interpretations, here comes another one which will at best try to put together various pieces of this riddle which ultimately might provide answer to various queries & clear ambiguities. This film has received two extreme forms of reviews - either it has been tremendously appreciated or it has been trashed. I agree to the fact that this film is very hard to gulp if you watch it at a theatre for the first time. But the fact that the plot stays with you long after you have left the theatre or that you start brainstorming merely points to the fact that the film has accomplished in its motive to baffle you & putting a riddle in your head. <br /> <br />While I wouldn't go into the routine of telling what the story is all about, I would rather point out to some events, some characters or situations in the film and connect them with other events or moments in the film, which one should pay attention to. Even if you haven't seen it & want to discover it on your own or you have seen it once & plans another viewing (which is most desirable) - these observations might make it easier for you. In the beginning the camera focuses on a red cover & slowly zooms towards it. You hear a breathing sound from underneath it. That's where Diane's ('Betty' - Naomi Watts) dream begins. The dream continues...you see a car driving through the dimly lit Mulholland Drive....you see Camilla ('Rita'-Laura Harring)...she asks the driver \\"What are you doing? We don't stop here.\\" Now move over to the part when Diane (Betty) is not dreaming & the events in reality is shown during the last half-hour of the movie. Diane (Naomi Watts) is being taken to a 'surprise party'....same road, same car, same camera angles....she asks \\"What are you doing? We don't stop here.\\" <br />Camilla receives her...they start walking uphill. In her dream Rita (Camilla) walks downhill. <br /> <br />Think of the dream as opposite of reality. Look at the characters in real situations appearing at her dream with names she has encountered at various turns in her life. <br />* When Betty arrives at Aunt Ruth's house she meets Mrs.Lenoix. She tells Betty \\"Oh! Just call me Coco. Everybody else does.\\" In reality she meets the same lady at the party; Coco says the exact same thing. <br />* In her dream Adam (Justine Theroux) is the director contemplating recasting the lead actress in his film. However he cannot make any choice on his own. He is shown the picture of a girl,' Camilla Rhodes', whom the 'Castiglianni Brothers' insist should be selected for the part. Watch out since the same girl in the photo is the girl who whispers at Rita's ear & kisses her at the party. <br />* In her dream the Director's (Theroux) life is in shambles - both personally & professionally. In reality it is just the opposite. He declares his engagement with Camilla (Rita). <br />* A very interesting thing is the 'Cowboy' character. He sort of bullies the director to select the 'girl in the photo'-Camilla Rhodes. But where does he come from? Just pay attention to the scene at the party-again! The girl (in the photo) comes, whispers at Rita's ear, kisses her & walks away. At the same time a guy with a 'white hat' passes by. Well he's the 'cowboy' at her dream. <br />* The hit man whom Diane hires to kill Camilla (Rita) seems inefficient in her dream. He messes up when he tries to kill a guy. In reality he is very skillful. Take a look at the guy standing near the counter when Diane is having a conversation with the hit man at 'Winkies'.He is the same \\"weird guy\\" at Winkies at the beginning talking about his strange dream & \\"God-awful feelings.\\" In a way he is inconsequential to the actual events, but he reflects Diane's (Betty's) fear & anxiousness in her dream. This guy was, in reality, standing beside the counter - in herdream Betty sees this guy talking about how he has seen the man sitting opposite to him \\"by the counter\\"- looking scared. <br /> <br />Paying attention to these small but relevant instances is what is going to make this film even more interesting to you. Actually Lynch uses the unique style of presenting fantasy as if its reality & the transition from dream to reality are not shown in a decipherable manner. Again if you pay attention to the 'Party' scene, we find jerky camera movements, hazy shots - things we expect in a surrealistic sequence. Well that is Mr. David Lynch for you!!! With such brilliance at every shot, Peter Deming's cinematography, Angelo Badalamenti's awesome score & of course both Naomi Watts & Laura Harring's performance it would be unfair to give this film anything less than five stars. <br /> <br />In a nutshell this film can be looked upon as the story of a girl who comes to L.A. with stars in her eyes, to make it big in Hollywood. In the process she meets another beautiful actress, falls madly in love with her which slowly turns obsessive & she also gets ditched by her. She gets mixed up in a world of treachery, nepotism, lies & false promises - all hidden behind the flashy lights, glitz & glamour of Hollywood. She takes revenge. But her action keeps haunting her; she repents it, laments it & all these completely erode her mentally & physically. You see the once beautiful & aspiring actress literally enter a world of self destruction. And you become a part of her journey through life. What could be better than having a DVD which you can watch over & over & keep on discovering newer things every time? This film is Lynch at his best. A true masterpiece & a MUST BUY.
B0002BO0US|5.0|Hailed belatedly  by some critics as the British \\"Pet Sounds,\\" \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" is, like Brian Wilson's triumph, a keyboard and choral-based pop masterpiece that has aged far more gracefully than many other albums of the era. Its melodies, harmonies and arrangements are as sophisticated yet accessible as the Beatles' finest moments, and without the aid of a George Martin: The Zombies wrote, produced, arranged and performed the entire album. The extremely cool hit \\"Time of the Season\\" is, like \\"Good Vibrations\\" or \\"Eight Miles High,\\" a zenith of  1960's pop-rock  Other tracks hint at Anglican hymnody and neo-baroque psychedelia. \\"Changes\\" would not sound out of place on a John Renbourn Group album. Only the well-intentioned but jarring anti-war piece, \\"The Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)\\" detracts from the overall effect. It is simply out of place. Imagine if someone dropped \\"Eve of Destruction\\" into the middle of \\"Astral Weeks\\" or the Trinity's \\"Czechoslovakia\\" into the middle of \\"Pet Sounds\\" and you get the idea. But that's why God made bonus tracks and programmable cd players! This Fuel 2000 reissue is superior to the \\"30th Anniversary\\" version in that it features several additional songs rather than alternate mixes only. I usually program out \\"Butcher's Tale\\" and replace it with \\"Smokey Day,\\" \\"Remember the Swan\\" and \\"I'll Call You Mine,\\" all recorded after the \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" sessions and each equal or even superior to almost anything else on the album.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have to give this release 5 stars because growing up we all dreamed of star wars and what it would be like to be jedi and such. But the biggest point you have to make is no matter how much Lucas changes the films you have to admit that over 30 years there will always be fans who will debate and even if you dont like what he did there is a good chance that you will still buy the films on DVD. Myself i can not wait i have brought every reason ever released in all the different formats and now wait for the DVD's.
B000021XS0|5.0|To say that Avril is a better guitarist than John Petrucci is the most ludicrist think I have ever heard-Avril couldn't even play a 5 second tapping solo. <br />A simple example Avril would not have a chance of playing any dream theater song, but John could play Avril's music upside down left handed and still do a better job. <br />Avril and limp Bizkit are absolute garbage they are merely for trendy air headed dumb teens who on hearing dream theater would complain that the songs are too long and that there are too many solo's. <br />And I guarantee you I could write better music than Avril and limp bizkit-but I don't wanna be a sellout and get famous playing trash. <br />
0451457994|5.0|<br /> 2001 is simply awesome . It might well be one of the best books  of the genre ever written .  <br /> <br /> The concept is great , the compilation even better . Only Clarke could have written this book . His style oozes all over it . It raises many philosophical questions , as all good science fiction should. The cold narrative style of ACC in this book grips you .  <br /> <br />If you haven't read 2001 , you haven't really read science fiction .    <br />
B000001FTJ|5.0|A few years ago I had bought Tom Waits newest release Alice. After being spendedly shocked, a friend recommended Swordfishtrombones. I went and picked it up and was blown away. From the opening track Underground to Rainbirds Tom Waits grabs and maintains the attention of any listener. With interesting lyrics from love ballads for his wife, to the hate of suberbia, Waits knows how to make a tune. One of my favorite tracks on the album is Shore Leave. A great investigation into the mind of a poor sailor on his night off in some foreign land. The album seems to be riddled with soldiers, love, and distaste of the city. The title track is one of the smoothest, interesting stories that Waits paints so vividly you'd swear you saw the whole thing in person. In conclusion, I would recommend any album of his to anybody, but my first would be Swordfishtrombones. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.
B000286RKW|5.0|MOVIE: In some ways this movie surpasses The Godfather in my opinion as the best mob movie ever. The reason why we don't see mob movies made anymore is because they've already been done perfectly. There's really nothing more to add to the genre. Goodfellas, like most classic mob films, explores the entire rise and fall of a man who is part of the mob. It's all about gaining power, money, and the will to do anything you want. It's about keeping your word, making the right investments, and looking out for your fellow goodfellas, wiseguys. The movie chronicles the true story of mobster Henry Hill from his rags to riches and back to rags story. That's really what makes this movie so interesting is that all of it is true. The acting is superb as well and Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance is incredible. The real main man behind this masterpiece is the main man behind the camera. Scorsese's approach to the film is just brilliant. He has the talent to be able to tell a story over a long period of time. This movie clocks in at about 2.5 hours, Gangs of New York and Casino are both 3hrs each. The movie flows so realistically yet you never get bored and it never drags. If you've ever wanted to know what corruption of the human soul is then this is the movie to show it to you.<br /><br />AUDIO: The DD 5.1 Mix is pretty decent, voice levels are pretty consistant. The movie features some classic songs of the eras that it chronicles and they sound pretty good.<br /><br />VIDEO: This is where we smile and say yipee! I own the first release of Goodfellas and let me tell you how happy I am to own this one. The first edition was one of the first DVD's on the market so the quality was pretty \\"yuck\\". With the first edition you had a non-anamorphic transfer, very poor video quality, and worst of all it was a flipper. That's right, half way through the movie you had to flip the disc to the other side to continue, and that was without any bonus materials. The new anamorphic transfer is just gorgeous except for one scene where I noticed a dark heavy line come across the screen during a scene with Robert De Niro. It looked very similar to the one I saw in Schindler's List.<br /><br />PACKAGING / EXTRAS: Bye-bye snapper case, hello Armary case. The two discs lay in the double Armary case with no insert with a very nice looking cover and back over. The extras are pretty weak for a second release if you ask me. The gold here would be the commentaries, especially the one with the actual Henry Hill. As for documentaries you have one about the Making of the film. Another with an all star line up of directors who comment on how the film influenced them, a look at real mob life, and a look at some hand drawn storyboards by Scorsese. Unfortunetly the interviews with the main cast and crew are all pre-release, which means that most of them are interviews made back in 1990. So I would say that's the only downfall. It would be interesting to see some present day interviews from the cast and crew. To top it off you have the Theatrical Trailer. Overall a major improvement from the first release. Finally!<br /><br />MOVIE SCORE: (* * * * *)<br /><br />DVD SCORE: (8 / 10)r is just gorgeous except for one scene where I noticed a dark heavy line come across the screen during a scene with Robert De Niro.

B0000VAFO0|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty entertaining overall. the effects were pretty good; the mood of the film was dark and rainy, but not so much where you couldn't tell what the heck is going on, as in some other films I could mention. The story did need to be fleshed out a little more, but I don't think the movie suffered from that too much. There is a debate over whether the vampires should be going around shooting at werewolves (or lycans as they are called here) instead of hand to hand combat, but I found that a bit refreshing as the hand to hand can get a little tiresome after a while.  Kind of made the whole thing more modern, as it were. The thing that detracted a little bit for me was the horrible acting of the guy who played the vampire Kraven.  I almost thought this was a B-movie when you can see him struggling to have an emotion other than brooding idiot.  Scott Speedman was a surprise, in that I've never found him too alluring and here he was very sexy and I thought the chemistry between him and Kate was really good.  I am looking forward to the love story progressing further in the sequel.  I hope that a certain head lycan will come back too, as the actor was very good and his charactor the most intriguing.
B000006TRV|2.0|Say what you like about Pink Floyd but they weren't exactly a barrel of laughs, were they?  Syd Barrett took the humour with him when he exited in 1967, and in the space of just a year, Pink Floyd turned from a whimsical pop group to the purveyor of torpid excursions in po-faced self-indulgence. This actually works on Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. But with Wall it really gets a bit too much. The themes of alienation, insanity and helplesness casting the hapless listener into a whirlpool of misery and inward suffering. Already by track 2 it's all 1984 with 30s fascist imagery transposed against a modern rock show scenario. And the theme of school being bad is covered more than adequately covered by monster No. 1 hit single, \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\", \\"Happiest Days of our Lives\\" and tape loops with frenzied teachers screaming and other miscellaneous effects. Subtle it ain't. Intense it is. If you're in the right mood, however, the Wall offers up some great moments, Musically this is a mixed bag, fans of 70s Floyd will not find much here to cheer about. The reason why the Wall has sold so many copies and has become a powerful brand in itself is perhaps that the concept is stronger than the music contained therein. There's the hits, of course. The soaring Comfortably Numb remains a steadfast bliss-out after a pint or two, with David Gilmour's voice complementing the music so well. I quite like the Trial bit at the end which is like a Dickens nightmare resurrected as Gilbert & Sullivan (great orchestration) and was nonplussed to read Bob Ezrin's name as co-composer of said tune. I've always associated Bob Ezrin's name with the group, Kiss. Still, no complaints.  Mother's a potent tune but is smothered by overly lush production and layered stack harmonies. A far cry from Animals. Thankfully we're living in the CD age because the thought of having to get up and flip this chunk of black vinyl over four times is daunting to say the least. To sum up, a great idea with strong sentiments and moment of musical lucidity partially ruined by heavy-handedness and, at times, clumsy and unsubtle imagery., a great idea with strong sentiments and moment of musical lucidity partially ruined by heavy-handedness and, at times, clumsy and unsubtle imagery.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is my favorite from Metallica and if you are a metal fan (even a rock fan), I will GUARANTEE you will like it. <br /> <br />Battery - 10/10 - Starts out as a \\"Mexican/Latin\\" sounding song, but then gets into a thrash like song. I love the chorus. <br /> <br />Master of Puppets - 10/10 - What can I say? The album's best song. 8:35 of pure genius, great riff, amazing solo, lyrics make you think. Definately the best. <br /> <br />The Thing That Should Not Be - 10/10 - Great intro, starts out slow and slowly leads into the song. Amazing. <br /> <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - 10/10 - Awesome guitar, lyrics are the best on the album. Gets addictive if you listen to it enough. <br /> <br />Disposable Heroes - 10/10 - Great heavy metal song.  <br /> <br />Leper Messiah - 10/10 - Many don't like this song, but I love the solo and the chorus to go along with it.  <br /> <br />Orion (Instrumental) - 10/10 - Great guitar, its slow, then fast, then slow? Amazing song, especially when it slows down around 4 minutes into the song. <br /> <br />Damage, Inc - 9.5/10 - I love this song, its just not one of my favorites on the album.  <br /> <br /> <br />Aren't you suprised I gave almost every single song on this album a 10? It's probably because this is one of the top 3 albums ever created by any artist.
B0000E1C73|5.0|Hey, i just got this cd not knowing what to expect, and i have to say that it is one of the greatest live albums ever.  It captures the live energy of the band with the crowd singing along.  Its a great recording and captures the essence of a live ska show. It kicks butt! Now, go and get it!
B00008OJSB|5.0|Avril's 1st album \\"Let Go\\" is just awesome!:<br /><br />1) Losing Grip: 4/5. Not too good the first time you listen it, but sometimes later, you truly love it<br /><br />2) Complicated: 5/5. Anything to say. Great<br /><br />3) Sk8er Boi: 5/5. Cool story, great music<br /><br />4) I'm With You: 5/5. A very personal song; you have to love it. Nice lyric and sounds<br /><br />5) Mobile: 5/5. One of the best songs in the album. It's like Complicated, but better<br /><br />6) Unwanted: 3/5. This one is just \\"fine\\". It could be better, it's too louder<br /><br />7) Tomorrow: 5/5. It's a slow song, but it's really good<br /><br />8) Anything But Ordinary: 5/5. Not too slow, not too fast. It's great for singing and to relax when you feel nervious<br /><br />9) Things I'll Never Say: 4/5. It's good, but the music could change, so it would be great<br /><br />10) My World: 5/5. It's awesome. When you feel bad, go and listen to this song, then you will feel much better<br /><br />11) Nobody's Fool: 5/5. Great sound, music and lyric. It's like Anything But Ordinary (just \\"like\\")<br /><br />12) Too Much To Ask: 5/5. It has a very beautiful message, a history from Avril and a guy she met a couple years ago, but it's a great song and the chorus is awesome!!!<br /><br />13) Naked: 3/5. This song is kind of weird, I can't understand what does she mean with that message \\"...I'm naked around you...\\" \\"I'm unprotected...\\" \\"You see right through me and I can't hide...\\"<br /><br />BONUS TRACK:<br /><br />14) Why: 4/5. It's a very nice song, with a very cool lyric and music, it's a nice song to sing and to listen it over and over again<br /><br />I can't talk about the videos...you might have already watched it...
B00008K9Z5|5.0|Thank God for Linkin Park...that's all I can say right now.<BR>we should all just admit that they have saved metal from being boring and redundant with their unique and innovative style of blending rap-style lyrics with rock-style music.  Before Linkin Park, nobody had ever really done that, so I guess you could say they're pioneers of a genre!<BR>Barely into their career, Linkin Park have become more successfull than all those lame bands out there that don't have half the creativity that the Park does.<BR>Chester's lyrics are so dark and personal...I can relate to them every painful day of my miserable life...I'm confused too Chester!!!...so confused.<BR>Anyway, you should probably throw out every other metal album you own...hell, every album period, because this is the only one worth listening to!!!

B00008US8R|5.0|Where to begin?!?!<BR>There is probably no band in the history of the world that will ever come close to matching the beauty, intensity and anger of Fallen. <BR>Musically, it boasts some of the most innovative songwriting since Beethoven, with complex and dizzying, yet satisfying guitar arrangements that rip, crunch and pummel the listener into an emotional submission.<BR>And as for the BEST vocalist ever, Amy Lee offers performance after performance of sheer brilliance as she allows us glimpses into her tortured world of pain.  She trully is the fallen angel of the band!!!<BR>As far as metal of alternative rock goes, nothing has ever come close to being as heavy as Fallen!  Forget about all those other wannabe bands out there, because none of them sound as pained and tortured as Evanescence.<BR>If I could make everyone in the world listen to one album for the rest of eternity, it would easily be Fallen!!!  I can't even imagine what kind of new and exciting things Amy Lee will do in the future...
B0000640RX|5.0|He's back, M16's with attached Cruise Missile launchers blazing. Everyone's favourite kick-ass-bandanna wearing super hero/fashion guru is back in a fantastic box set of DVD's, digitally remastered to blow you AND the commies away in style whilst sticking to the original visions of the creator himself Ted Kotcheff. So now when John Rambo gets up close and personal, the improved sound effects mean you can too. <br /> Despite the addition of cut scenes, the impeccably original story remains intact. Disgraced Vietnam Veteran John Rambo is court marshalled for a crime he didn't commit and wages a \\"one man war\\" against both his former employers and the numerous bad guys he comes upon. 68 explosions, 90,000 rounds and 100 individual gun shot wounds to our hero later and we find ourselves on a cliff-hanger that would make Stanley Kubrick brick himself in suspense. It's so tense that it makes his later film classic \\"Cliffhanger\\" look like a muscley guy striding up some snowy hill for 2 hours. <br /> In an interview last year, Ted explained the crisis that the creatively exhausted writers faced for the eventual ending. He said: \\"Basically, the engineers were fresh out of blanks for the fake guns. This created a problem I had never thought I could face; ending a film without using a gun. Because of this, we created and filmed various endings and picked the one that worked best.\\" <br /> So for your pleasure and of course Rambo's, here are some of the endings you'll find on this DVD: <br /> <br />* Rambo is saved at the last minute from \\"The General\\" in his personal rocket Helicopter by his allies the Viet-Kong Nazis, who fire an ICBM, stolen from the Russians, at the helpless General. Our hero luckily jumps behind a barrel marked TNT and therefore survives the explosion and Nuclear fallout. <br /> <br />* Just before Rambo fires his semi-automatic cluster bomb launcher, he is abducted from behind by none other than Adolf Hitler himself who we find had framed his suicide and with the help of the Commies had lengthened his life-span. Our Hero is then imprisoned in Castle Von Volfenstien and is tested on constantly to find \\"80's action hero skin piercing bullets\\" but to no avail. Rambo fights them off barehandedly. This idea was not used as the production company were faced with a lawsuit from the makers of Wolfenstien 3D. <br /> <br />There is even a bonus music track by the European Wing of the Rambo fan club. The Association of Rambo Servicemen (Europe) or ARSE for short, sing the parody of Meat Loaf's \\"Rock and Roll Mercenaries.\\" What more could we ask for? <br /> So sit back, strap on your Bandanna that comes free in every set and enjoy the show.... <br /> <br />Xylophone.co.uk rating: 5/5 \\"An American Dream\\" <br />
0553573403|1.0|I find it hard to believe this book has attracted so many fans over the age of 12. Martin uses a multi-threaded plot structure, with each chapter shifting to a different part of the story and leaving you with an attempt at a mini-cliffhanger to keep you from putting the book down.<br /><br />The setting is the kind of purile, derivative mismatch of historical settings and fantasy elements that you might expect from some kind of SCA fanfic: there is little overt magic in this book, and the prominent part of the world is a continent ruled by a Germanic-flavored polytheistic Holy Roman Empire type of thing, with lords and knights and plate armor and longswords. But we all liked Rennaisance-era fencing and swashbuckling a la \\"Princess Bride\\" too, didn't we, so Martin throws in a seafaring civilization from the east who use rapier-type swords and speak in some kind of Spanish accent. The copper-skinned assyrian/aryan barbarians from even further east rankled me further with their hackneyed savagery.<br /><br />Get ready for some truely campy prose if you pick this book up. People talk like hawkers at the local Rennaisance Festival. Perhaps Martin had a limit to the word length of this story and decided he had best drop a lot of articles. People don't sit ON their horses in this book, they just sit horses. Same with thrones. When describing some battle scenes, Martin employs the term \\"taken in the rear\\" with comical gusto.<br /><br />The characters are never given any room to breathe or develop, as this is a plot-driven story and the characters have roles to play which are explained whenever is convenient. They'll keep you on your toes by doing things which are strange and inexplicable at certain points, then NOT doing seemingly obvious things whenever sense wouldn't suit Martin's plot goals. To sort of give them the illusion of depth, some characters are imbued with truely anoying quirks which prevent you from liking any of them.<br /><br />And you won't really want to, because they tend to die horribly right when you would hope something heroic or uplifting would happen. It is interesting that Martin takes the idealized fantasy world of Rennaisance Festivals and padded-weapon players and shoots it through with such an overwhelming dose of real Medieval grit. I can't imagine anyone would want to live in this world or be any of these characters, even if more of your friends call you by your SCA name than your legal name. One thing which is rather funny is the predilection, bordering on fetishistic, that Martin has for describing the medieval food these people eat. Not a chapter goes by without some mention of food and eating.<br /><br />Ah, I could go on and on, but I think I have deserved reading something decent now. If you have taste, you will want to avoid this book.want to, because they tend to die horribly right when you would hope something heroic or uplifting would happen.

B00004Z459|3.0|Linkin Park arent that great with their repetive guitar hooks and predictable lyrics this is the perfect band for anyone under the age of 15 although LP do have their moments where you can see flashes of brilliance although those moments are often limited In The End and One Step Closer would have to be those moments but after those songs it seems that everything sounds the same.......CAUTION avoid Meteora at all costs it is the same old as Hybrid Theory
1401300901|5.0|I found this to be an enjoyable read.  If you like to read for the sheer pleasure of a good story, then this is a good choice.  If you are looking for something deep, then go read a classic.   Celelia Ahern really gives you a good feel for her characters and leaves you wanting more.  I really enjoyed this
0345347951|4.0|I've only read a couple of books by Clarke, but someone recommended it to me so I figured why not.  The story is about these aliens that come down to earth in the late 20th century for some unknown reason.  Within 50 years, humanity has advanced to the point where nobody has to work anymore and science has advanced so fast.  But there is a catch, which I won't spoil here. <br /> <br />I liked the pace of the book, and I think Clarke is pretty descriptive of things that could be.  He skips from the 1970's to the 2050's.  He also does well describing the homeland of the aliens.  A couple of things bothered me, however.  One was the explanation of how we had seen the aliens before.  I thought it was a bit convoluted and could've been much simpler and more to the point.  Another is the \\"catch,\\" which wasn't really fleshed out that much.  I was a bit disappointed by the end, but it does make sense that it would end that way.   <br /> <br />Overall I would recommend sci-fi fans to read this if they haven't already.  You can grab it from the library or used-its pretty short for the price of paperbacks.  If you don't like sci-fi, it doesn't have a lot of detail of science theories (except for a brief discussion of relativity).  It is a well written book, and I did enjoy it despite the flaws.
0440238609|5.0|I don't even like to read, but i had to for class and luckily i chose the best trilogy of all time! Phillip Pullman is the greastest author i've read. As far as people putting messages on here about how bad he is for having anti-christian promotion in his books.. it's a book for crying out loud.. it's an amazing book, and without that in it it just wouldn't be what it is. Myself, I am athiest so i can't say it bothers me any. This book is more suited towards readers at the age of 13(if having good comprehension levels)and up. Phillip Pullman is the best fantasy trilogy writer of all time.
B00005RFAI|5.0|this is a great cd. I say it has to be pinks best cd so far. my favorite song has to be just like a pill. Its such a great song. Lets just say if you like pink, avril lavigne, tatu and other stuff like that then you will like pink too. She is being herself on this album and I like that!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Mr Lucas, you have ripped off Star Wars fans long enough. And now you have the gall to release The special editions only on dvd??? Let me say that you only made the movies worse by adding a FAKE looking Jabba The Hut, etc, etc , etc. Dont you think your rich enough?? Why do you insist on continuing to rip off Star Wars Fans? By the way another gripe I have.........Phantom Menance SUCKED and Jar-Jar MUST DIE!!!!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|The first season of this wonderfully rich and vibrant show on The WB was a fine and solid debut. It set things in place that the show will take higher and with even better results. Such is season two for an example. With the addition of a new character, the junior year scored. Opening with \\"Sadie, Sadie\\" and \\"Hammers And Veils\\", the two part opener resolves the Lorelei/Max cliffhanger from season one. This was originally aired as a two hour premiere. A great opener. Rory's future educational life and Lorelei's empty nest syndrome is given a foreshadowing in \\"The Road Trip To Harvard\\". Luke's nephew, the broody and troublesome Jess, debuts in \\"Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy\\", after he is sent to live with Luke. He doesn't like anyone...except Rory. He causes some minor mayhem in the delightful \\"The Inns And Outs Of Inns\\", before turning the town on it's ear when Rory gets hurt in \\"Teach Me Tonight\\". An ongoing story arc here also concerns Richard and Emily(Edward Herrmann, Kelly Bishop), when Richard goes through a career crisis that we first really learn about in \\"Presenting Lorelei Gilmore\\", and is further expanded on in \\"Help Wanted\\", and \\"Back In The Saddle Again\\". One of the best episodes here is the wintery delight of \\"The Bracebridge Dinner\\", where Lorelei and Sookie invite friends and family to the inn. \\"Lost And Found\\" is another highlight, as the season ends with a wedding and a broken heart in \\"I Can't Get Started\\". There are many more good things here, but too many to write. Like any TV show, every season is filled with some duds. The duds here are \\"Red Light On The Wedding Night\\", \\"There's The Rub\\", which has Lorelei and Emily going to a spa for a weekend, and \\"Secrets And Loans\\", among a few others. The show continues to be one of the most incredibly brilliant and sharpest shows on TV. The dialogue and banter continue to be second to none, and continues to make people wonder where the closet full of Emmy's this show should have won by now are at. The cast is one of the finest ensembles on TV. Lauren Graham continues to be one of the best leading ladies on TV. Her Lorelei is fleshed out and she carries the show with a magnetic presence that cannot be denied. She is a vision of beauty, and an actress of high caliber talent. The same can be said for Alexis Bledel, who continues to be one of the best representations of a young woman on TV. Same goes for Kelly Bishop, who is a fine and elegant actress in her portrayal. Much praise to the rest of the cast and the town's oddball collection of quirky citizens, which includes the likes of Luke, Lane, Miss Patty, Kirk, Taylor, Babbette, and Paris. A fine collection of supporting characters. The show continues to show a truly strong and healthy relationship between mother and daughter, and the nature of their relationship is a lot more common than some people think. Lorelei has proven herself to be a great mother and the proof is in all the good she has done for Rory, and what she has done herself and their lives and done so mostly on her own. Take a trip to Stars Hollow soon. You won't soon regret it.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Just got \\"A Valid Path\\" and I love it.  I'm a long-time Alan Parsons fan (from 1980, when I was 15), and I felt it was well worth the 5-year wait since the last album (\\"Time Machine\\") was released.  As other reviewers have covered the details and nuances of the songs on \\"A Valid Path\\" better and more thoroughly than I ever could, I wanted to simply put a question out to other AP fans:  is it just me, or does Alan (doing the vocals on \\"We Play The Game\\") sound almost EXACTLY like Eric Woolfson?  When I first listened to the track, I thought \\"Oh, wow - he got Eric to make an appearance on the album!\\"  Imagine my surprise when I checked the liner notes and there was no Woolfson to be found.  No *wonder* I was never able to pick Alan's voice out from the older Project songs when he was providing additional or backing vocals - that's because his and Eric's voices obviously blended so well!  Finding out that Alan is not just an amazingly talented musician and producer, but also a terrific singer was the icing on the cake for me, and I highly recommend this album!
B0002DB52M|2.0|Von Trier's best work was done on \\"The Kingdom\\". This film is really more of a novelty than anything else. Worth renting but I wouldn't buy it.
0451197879|5.0|I've long moved on from Stephen King's horror tales.  However, Roadwork remains a favorite novel above the rest. The story reads like watching a classic \\"Decade Under the Influence\\" 70's film.     Bart Dawes grapples with middle age, loss of home, family, and employment set in the empty world of middle class America of the 70s. Dawes' only comfort is his memories and imaginary conversations with his conscience, whimsically named Freddy after his dead son. As he watches a new road pave over the places he loves and his memories, Barton Dawes revolts against complacency and embarks on an odessey to find his place in the world that no longer makes sense.    Younger readers may not understand the setting and should do some research into the time period.  The seventies was the decade white-bread America came of age and realized our perfect suburban worlds were an empty facade contengent upon the whims of politics and big business.  After reading Roadwork's climatic ending, one can see the themes of ever increasing government intrusion and corporate power over the lives of everyday people is still true today, and frighteningly, has increased since the first energy crisis of 30 years ago.
B00007LTIA|5.0|It's no secret that with Tales From Topographic Oceans, the rock critics turned their backs on Yes. You've probably heard thousands of stories from prog rock detractors who use this album as to why punk rock happened. Let's just say that Yes had created a far more ambitious project than they ever did before, and because of that, it went right over the heads of the rock critics (and since that time, prog rock was given a bad name, partially because of the critics). This was a double album with four side-length cuts (not the first album like this, as Tangerine Dream's Zeit and Soft Machine's Third all pre-dated Tales From Topographic Oceans as double albums with only side-length cuts), and what was guaranteed was absolutely nothing was radio friendly. Bill Bruford was now out of the picture, he moved on to King Crimson. Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman, Chris Squire, and Steve Howe were now having Alan White on drums. White already appeared on the Close to the Edge Tour (most of the cuts on Yessong was from him, a couple from Bruford), before that he was a session musician, appearing on such albums as John Lennon/The Plastic Ono Band's Live Peace in Toronto, 1969, George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, and John Lennon's Imagine. Despite what Rick Wakeman might have felt of Tales, I have always felt his best playing on a Yes album was here, he really let his Mellotron and Moog stretch out. The album opens up with \\"The Revealing Science of God\\", which is truly one of the best songs on this album. It has all the great Yes trademarks. Certainly not meant for FM radio airplay. \\"The Ancient\\" is another amazing cut, I remembered first hearing this cut, the Mellotrons were ringing in my ears long after I heard it. This proves that I felt Wakeman's gave his best here (even if he thought otherwise, as already mentioned). \\"The Ancient\\" is a bizarre, experimental piece, dominated by percussion from Alan White while you hear Chris Squire's bass. Lots of strange sounding vibraphones (itcould've been Wakeman's Mellotron, which he included vibes, as well as the classic strings and choir). It's nothing like Yes had done before. Then the song mellows out with an acoustic passage, and Yes' trademark vocals. The album's closing, \\"Ritual\\", another excellent piece, with more extended passages. It's also no secret this album really disillusioned Rick Wakeman and he left the band shortly thereafter. Lifestyle conflicts were another reason (Wakeman preferred hard drinking and hamburgers, the rest of the band were vegetarians and sober), so Wakeman decided to pursue his solo career further. Regardless of rock critics say of this album, this is truly a great album. Requires a few listens, as this perhaps their least accessible albums, but still recommended if you enjoy Yes.
0452282152|1.0|Beautiful idea and thorough research of needed details, but this author who has a degree in creative writing proves that one cannot buy talent. Aside from a memorable metaphor on page one, this book is bland as a pauper's meal of yesterday's potatoes. Come on- it's Vermeer! Exquisite chaste light, deep meditation of common experiences, vivid detail. The text of this book is colorless and despite the popular review of the work, the soul of the characters are never truly discovered. Ok, it's a maid's tale- set in a time and life that are  agonizing. All the more reason for more depth, more creative use of words. Sometimes it sounds like the author popped a valium & learned but 5 words of the English language. \\"..the canvas was yellowish white\\"-\\"I closed the door, blotting out the noise...\\"  My dog could have done better. Oh, yeah, he didn't get a degree in creative writing. Shucks.I saw the film first... big mistake. The visual version will live with me forever. However, after seeing the masterpiece of the film, the book has no hope of repenting.  It's great to see art subjects making the bestseller list, but I sure wish some art would make it into the product.
B000002IOJ|3.0|One might start by saying that a lot of the material on this album is a departure from their two earlier albums. The biggest departure is the lyrics. For most reviews I don't even mention the lyrics because most bands don't know what they're talking about (or it sounds forced). But on this album, the lyrics deal less with the occult and \\"gothic\\" type themes to deal with worldy issue like rainforest destruction, the U.N., pathological liars... <br /> <br />The opener starts out with usual speed of a rock song. No speed antics yet...and there won't be any speedy songs for the rest of the album (the exception being \\"Blessed in Contempt\\" but even that is a stretch). Speed doesn't necessarily equal good, but Testament compensates well for the lack of speed with some of the narlyist guitar lines of ANY Testament album. (Just listen \\"Greenhouse Effect\\" and \\"Envy Life\\".)   <br /> <br />The guitar work on the album is very accomplished and deserves much credit. The guitar work and the overall song writing are the album strong points. The bass lines shine in between the guitar solos. The Achilles heel of the album is the rather bland drumming (that 'click' instead of 'pound'). Louie has to be one of the most unoriginal forgettable drummers of the brief Thrash history.  <br /> <br />Their creativity shines at the end of the album with \\"The Ballad\\" and the awesome acoustic guitars to that song. The instrumental song at the end is forgettable but even then it would be hard to call it bad. The one ultra-cheesy thing they do at the beginning of \\"Sins of Omission\\" is they play a kind of Knightrider theme chord. <br /> <br />Still a good album despite the differences between this album and the previous effort. It's not as much of a \\"shock-and-awe\\" oh-my-god-is-this-for-real? album as 'New Order'. Its more of a \\"let me sit down and think along with the music\\" kind of album. Worth having. 3 1/2 stars.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I want the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on DVD. Why is that so much to ask?  <br /> <br />My VHS is deteriorating. That's what VHS does, it deteriorates. And it's NOT in widescreen.  <br /> <br />I don't own an LD. I don't want an LD. What I WANT is the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD.  <br /> <br />I don't mind touch-ups, like getting rid of the green boxes around the TIE fighters or mixing the sound for 5.1. I would welcome that. <br /> <br />But the added scenes and re-edits are HORRIBLE! <br /> <br />There is nothing \\"superior\\" about the CGI; it looks ridiculous. It looks like fakey-assed CGI.  <br /> <br />\\"Greedo shooting first\\" changes Han Solo's character, and it looks fakey. Han dodges lasers?! <br /> <br />(the reason people keep saying that is because it's true! There are tens of thousands of us Star Wars fans, no wonder we sound like a broken record!)  <br /> <br />Remember colorization?  <br /> <br />Every other movie on the planet is being re-released on DVD in its original form. Why is it not so with these, ESPECIALLY these?  <br /> <br />Even if the new scenes were not as horrid as they are, I would still... <br /> <br />WANT THE ORIGINALS ON DVD. WHY IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?! <br /> <br />Hell yes, it's an issue of sentimental value! That's what movies are about, SENTIMENT! People shell out their hard-earned cash to own big boxed sets of their favorite movies because they LOVE them!    <br /> <br />The originals are near and dear to my heart, I WOULD PAY TOP DOLLAR to own them on DVD.  <br /> <br />I have no need and no desire to own the \\"special editions.\\" There's nothing special about them for me. <br /> <br />
B000002GQJ|4.0|This album is great! The best songs on this are, ofcourse, \\"Question\\", \\"And The Tide Rushes In\\" and \\"The Minstrel's Song\\".<br /><br />This  album even has some of Greame's Poetry included. Some say his work is goofy or silly, but I love it!<br /><br />If you like the Moody Blues, you should like this album.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Brutal? <br />Many people have commented on the \\"brutality\\" of The Passion of the Christ, saying that it was \\"too brutal\\". Well Mel Gibson didn't just make up this story and decide to add a certain level of brutality to it, it really did happen. <br /> <br />The Message: LOVE <br />The main message of the movie is that Jesus (The Son of God) came down to earth as a mere man, and being the ultimate sacrifice, died for our sins, so we could spend eternity with Him......if we so choose. I was raised as the son of a preacher, and I've heard of this message since I was small. Jesus died on a cross for our sins. But you tend to hear it so much that it loses it's meaning over time. Then you see a film like this, and you realize just how much He suffered. And for the people who balk at the brutality....God help you if Mel Gibson had made it the way it REALLY was. If he did, I guarantee this movie would not be shown. <br /> <br />Crucifixtion 101 <br />Gibson's version is of to date the most accurate depiction so far, but still falls short of being totally truthful and accurate. For instance the Roman soldiers placed a hood over Jesus and punched and smacked Him so bad that He was disfigured. They tore the beard off of His face pulling chunks of flesh with it. He was so disfigured, that you couldn't even recognize Him. When He was hung on the cross He was hung naked, He didn't have a cloth around Him. This was a common practice for the Romans. The crucifying of people was meant more to shame them, as they were crucified in public. The actual crucifixtion was not meant to kill them. After a certain length of shame and ridicule, the Roman soldiers would break the legs (shins) so they could die. You see they supported themselves with their legs pushing up, so they could breathe. Once their legs were broken, they would die of asphyxiation, for a lack of oxygen. Jesus' legs were not broken, because the Roman soldier knew He was already dead, thereby fulfilling the Old Testament prophecy that none of His bones would be broken. Aside from these few brutalities left out, it is still a brutal film, and I highly recommend it to the believer and non-believer alike.  <br /> <br />The \\"anti-semitic\\" Debate <br />And no, the film is NOT anti semitic. NO ONE (Jews, Romans)put Jesus to death. It was all part of God's perfect plan and will. Most people don't understand this. In the Old Testament the old covenant stated that in order for God to forgive you of your sins, you had to sacrifice a lamb that was white and perfect with no spot or blemish. Then God offered His only Son to be the ultimate sacrifice (referred in Scripture as the Lamb of God), so we didn't have to offer an animal sacrifice.  <br /> <br />Left Behind: It's Real <br />The Jewish people don't believe that Jesus came and died and rose again, that's why they are against the Christian faith. The Roman soldiers that guarded Jesus' tomb after He died were guarding it because the Jewish priests feared that Jesus' followers would come and steal the body away, claiming that he rose from the dead. These soldiers would die for leaving their post, yet they fled when the Angel came and uncovered the tomb and Jesus arose from the dead. The Roman soldiers were paid off, and the majority of Jews were deceived. That's why the early christians were deeply persecuted and killed. The Jews are still waiting for Him to come to the earth for the first time, but when He comes (which will be the second time) that's when He will come for those that believed in Him and rapture them away to spend eternity with Him in heaven. The Jews are God's chosen people, and one day they WILL understand. They have been the most oppressed people on history (even now with just about all the middle east against them) but their day of glory is coming.  <br /> <br />The Choice <br />The Christian faith is NOT about religion, but about a personal relationship with the One who gave His life for you, Jesus, God's only Son. If youwant to spend eternity in heaven with Him, you must accept Him as your personal Lord and Saviour. In the Bible He says, \\"I am the Way the Truth and the Life, no man (mankind) comes to the Father (God) but by Me\\". God gave us a free will to choose eternity with Him or eternity in Hell, He does not send anyone to Hell. If you want to spend eternity with Him instead of eternity burning in Hell, then just say this simple prayer: \\"Dear Lord Jesus, I confess that I am a sinner, and I believe that you died on the cross and rose again on the third day. Come into my heart and be my personal Lord and Saviour, Amen\\" That's all there is to it. Read the Bible to understand and develop a closer relationship with Him.
0780622553|5.0|Kiefer Sutherland did a great job in this great movie.  If you like sci-fi movies, this is a movie you won't want to miss.
B00005JMUA|5.0|For those who say this movie sucked have no idea what thet're talking about.  Not only is Vol. 2 the best of the KILL BILL series, but it is one of the best movies that has came out recently.  It is all the better because it takes a turn from the already great Japanese story line from vol. 1, and goes out to the old West.  This setting is where Tarantino plays off old Western films like THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, as well as some of the best horror films ever to grace the screen, such as Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD, also Lucio Fulci's THE GATES OF HELL.  Not going to tell the ending, but it is more than satisfactory.  With some of the best acting in any of Quentin's films surely adds up to one of his best films.  Definetly check it out.
B00004BZ0V|3.0|This is a alright cd, but i have some problems with it. First to start with it's a great cd, especially for first listeners. For us others that take the the clash more serious its quite horrible and doesnt rate good at all. but with my experience with the cd its what got me into the clash. you can feel the energy of Joe Strummer and Mick Jones (two brilliant song writers). also it sort gives you a idea of all the different songs the clash wrote. but thats not completely true because most of the songs are quite pop like. you totally miss things like combat rock where most of the cd is what people call today reggae. the other problem i have with the cd is that its not the greatest sound quality. for you people that buy lots of cd's probably wouldnt know this but if you want the best sound quality as possible (which was quite essential for the clash) then i insist on getting their albums on tape. they sound alot better. its like i said, its a good cd if you have never the clash before but if you do listen to them expect suprises. they were not a punk band at all. they wrote all different kinds of music.
B000267JQK|3.0|First off, I'm getting a little sick of people that whine and moan about how one band sounds like another.  Of course bands that play music in the same genre are going to sound similar.  Not every band is going to go out and completely redefine music with each song, that sort of the is quite impossible.  When you listen to a song you should not immediately start to compare it to other songs you've heard.  When you do that, your completely missing the point.  What you should be doing is asking yourself, does this song sound good, does it speak to me. <br /> <br />Well now that I've gotten my little rant out of the way, on with the review.  I've given \\"Disclaimer II\\" three stars for a very specific reason.  You only get five new songs.  On a twenty song disc you only get five new songs.  That is clearly not worth a full five stars.  If you already own the original \\"Disclaimer\\", do yourself a favor and download the new songs.   <br /> <br />They are \\"Sold Me\\", \\"Cigarettes\\", \\"Love Her\\", \\"Take Me Away\\", and \\"Got It Made\\", also known as numbers 13-17.  The other three songs on the end of the disc can be found on either your local radio station with the horrible version of \\"Broken\\" that features Amy Lee, or on the \\"Punisher\\" soundtrack (\\"Out of My Way\\"), and from the \\"Daredevil\\" soundtrack (\\"Hang On\\").   <br /> <br />The five new songs are not the best that I've heard from Seether, but they are far from bad.  So if you don't already own \\"Disclaimer\\" than \\"Disclaimer II\\" isn't a bad buy.  I was hoping for more so that's why it's three instead of five.   <br />
B00004TDTO|5.0|Before their were your favorite slasher stars like Jason Vorhees, Freddy Kreuger, Michal Myers, ect., there was a shark that terrorised the seaside island of Amity.

Afterwards, the shark kills a little boy and Brody becomes scared. This is where Quint (Robert Shaw) steps in. He offers too kill the shark, but for a lot of money. They don`t hire him, instead they do what they planed. They kill a shark but it`s the wrong one, and the mayor is too greedy too stop the people from going in the water. Then there is another attack, this time Brody`s son is witniss too it, putting him into shock. This causes the mayor too rethink Quint. So now Brody, Quint, and Hooper (the marine biologyst) hunt the shark.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is easily one of the best prison/prison-escape movies of all time, but more, it's one the best MOVIES of all time, period.<br /><br />Set at a deliberate but never uninteresting/boring pace, the film tells of an unlikely, intelligent, passive, and innocent prisoner sent to a rough, rough place, Shawshank maximum security prison.  Run by a true sociopath warden who is a Bible quoting fanatic who practices hardly what he assumes to be in the position of preaching, he is as corrupt (or moreso) as the most corrupt guilty and abusive/animalistic prisoners he is in control of.  Tim Robbins has never been finer in a mostly dramatic role, and exhibits it throughout his ample acting talent.  Morgan Freeman, playing \\"Red\\" also has never had a better role.<br /><br />There are parts of this film that are quite difficult to watch, especially the prison-rape scenes, and scenes of the brutality and \\"obtuse\\" nature of the psychotic warden.  But they are all worth enduring, and very important to the overall concept of this movie, which is that there is something in the human spirit which is incorruptible and enduring, the sense of \\"hope,\\" the feeling that no matter how bleak one's situation and surroundings may be, keeping hope alive is essential to getting through the incomprehensible and obscene circumstances which Tim's character has to endure before his final reward, freedom.<br /><br />There are just so many good things about this movie, that it's hard to know where to begin or end.  The acting by all is superb.  The musical score is contemplative and powerful at times, and every situation and character is believable and seems well thought out and played consistently throughout.  Each scene has its own special grace and power, from the sublime and subtle.  Despite its length, this movie never bores, never becomes uninteresting in the slightest.  It moves along magically at its own speed, which is just about perfect given the subject matter.<br /><br />This is a story about trying to remain \\"human\\" in an inhumane place, and is almost existential in its various ways of pointing the importance of that concept out.  From the meek \\"library\\" keeper and his birds, to the scene where Tim Robbins KNOWS he's gonna be punished (in solitary, in the \\"hole\\") for his actions but he opts instead to treat himself and to the prison to some simple music, because some things are simply worth suffering for, to the final ones of \\"redemption,\\" everything clicks here, big time.<br /><br />Despite its length, when watching and re-watching (it's one of those movies you just have to watch parts of at least, time and time again) Shawshank Redemption, I feel tingles up my spine at certain parts and though I know the truly inspiring and touching ending by heart, it never fails to disappoint.  Every single scene seems so well thought out, not only from a coherent, reasonable, believable, and heart/mind tugging sense, but from an overall sense of \\"human-ness\\" which embraces the movie as a whole, start to finish.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough to those who have not yet experienced its power, its grace, and its testament to hope, and faith, and belief that no matter what the odds, whatever the conditions we all may find ourselves in this game (sometimes very cruel and unforgiving) called life, keeping hope alive is or should be our first commandment.<br /><br />\\"Get busy living, or get busy dying,\\" Tim says at a point when he's had quite enough of the vicious and barbarous circumstances he, an innocent man, has been made to suffer at what cost?  Damn straight.  Kudos to old-timer (and eventual suicide victim) James Whitmore as well, but every actor and every scene and every move in this excellent film is top-notch.<br /><br />This movie may not be for everyone, however, last I checked, it was RATED #2 (only behind the original \\"Godfather\\" film at the internet movie datebase website) as greatest film of all time.  While that may be stretching it a bit, there is little to quibble with here, and I wish it could've gone on for another two hours to tell the truth.<br /><br />A great, great, great, great movie.<br /><br />\\"I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

B00003CXCT|1.0|People go on and on about the \\"timeless\\" qualities of these films; the \\"mythic\\" undertones; the \\"life-changing\\" power of the Star Wars films. Bottom line: they were great when I was 7. Now I'm 34 and they're silly, boring, phony, and have nothing in them to recommend  other than some snappy dilogue in the second one -- which for reasons known only to George Lucas is supposed to be the fifth one.  <br /> <br />Now, we get to re-live the low stands of our youth by purchasing DVD's of the \\"Special\\" editions of these films. No thanks. What I really want is a DVD of the Star Wars Holiday Special from '78. Now THAT's entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br />
0793542049|3.0|This is probably a great book for beginners or for people just learning how to read music.  I think most people who listen to music can figure out the infamous r-3, r-5, r-8, progressions just from listening or transcribing bass lines off records.  I was fairly disappointed that this was all that he covered in more than great detail in the book.  I recommend walking jazz lines for bass, and blues bass.  This is not a completely bad book but just is geared toward beginners with probably less than 1 month of playing or who have bad ears.

B00005B36H|5.0|A mixture of grudge, metal and alternative rock, this album reflects what rock should be: loud, hard, fast, but soft in the right places, with those pleaserable little tweaks in between like 'Mantra' and 'Eon Blue Apocalypse' and 'Faaip De Oiad' that calm you down before the next song.  The title track is awesome, building up and up into a driving cresendo that blows the listener away.  Not frightening, like their last album, but not so comforting either, as we learn when the album ends with 'Faaip De Oiad'.  It's as if Tool picked up where Zeppilin left off: this is what Led would sound like now, if John hadn't died, and they had lived to be a hundred years.  Music at its strongest, and I eagerly await their next album, which should be coming along in five more years,

B00005JLEX|5.0|I have already pre-ordered the box sets for Seinfeld Season 1 and 2 and the box set for Season 3.  I hope there is a lot of advanced orders, so that they will release more seasons before the end of the year.   I got to have something to ask for as a present! LOL!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|everytime and touch of my hand are okay songs... but all the others I could do without.  Especualy the songs featuring rappers and r&b beats.
B00005JLXE|2.0|As of this review there are 172 used and new copies of this movie for sale.  172?!  I have never seen any film that so many want to be rid of at one time.  Alright, the main problem, and this carries on throughout the story, is that I expected Morpheus and Neo and Trinity from \\"The Matrix\\" to show up at any moment.  Or, at least, to see Batman go flying by overhead and pausing ever so slightly to cover the Moon.  Where o' where did Daredevil's super-abilities come from?  Okay, for the sake of comic book fantasy I can buy into a blind superhero with the ability of echo-location.  It makes for some interesting and often cool special effects shots mixing sound and visual action.  But at no point does it make clear why he can suddenly jump off a building, fall for ten stories, then bounce athletically from scaffolding to scaffolding until he lands without a scratch.  By the end of the film Daredevil is jumping from rooftop to rooftop, across four-lane streets!  Also, there are so many moments that rip off \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" that this film is really nothing more than another contrived superhero flick.  Also, contrary to my earlier statement which involved specific special effects, most of the other effects are horrible, looking more like computer game characters battling one another, then editing in close-ups of the character's faces.  It all makes for some surreal continuity and requires a serious suspension of disbelief.  Overall, this is a lame superhero movie with a flat script, bland performances, and ideas stolen from previous blockbusters in the feeble hope at repeat success.  Don't help out the studios who insist on making the same kinds of films again and again.  Do not buy this movie.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Some of the reviewers have made comments such as, \\"this is not for the dumb minded\\", etc, or \\"how could anyone not like this movie?\\".   It was not hard to see the metaphors in the movie-that is pretty glaring! I mean, the whole movie is about Finney's character telling stories and it's connection to his life. Kids have apparently enjoyed this film and understand it. So, you don't have to have a superior IQ to view this film.   Personally, I couldn't sit through more than 40 minutes of this movie, and neither could my boyfriend. While the acting was very good-it did not touch any nerves with me. I felt it just dragged on, and the characters were rather dull and emotionless. Maybe I missed a significant moment in the film which I was too impatient to wait for. It certainly didnt capture my heart enough for me to sit through it. As far as being a slow, dragged out film, it is pretty much in line with \\"In The Bedroom\\".
B000022TSW|3.0|This movie made me laugh myself insanely the first time I saw it. After a while, it's only good for a few laughs. I would definetely recommend getting it though. It's the most fun you'll have watching a movie in a long time.
B000089RVX|5.0|Let me say first that I'm a big Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Fan. With that being said, let me say there are very few bands with female lead singers that I enjoy. Now let me say that this band is great. No, this band is incredible. It's nice to see a female singer with a great voice fronting a solid band. It's also nice to see that they are not afraid to be a little different by putting in some slower/classier songs that really show off her voice. I can't wait for the next cd.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|The PPV on TV was pretty good, not the greatest ever though. This might be the greatest WWE DVD ever. It is absolutely PACKED with bonus material. You get the full PPV, with unaired interviews, Wrestlemania trivia, classic WrestleMania matches, the Ric Flair hosted \\"10 greatest matches of WrestleMania\\", and a look at some of the different superstars that have climbed their way up to the top of the WWE Roster. I bought this on DVD the first day it came out on DVD, and do not regret it at all. If you are a wrestling fan, this is the DVD for you.
B0001AP12G|1.0|Kanye West is one of the worst rappers out there, he's just as bad or worse than P. Diddy.

B00028HBKM|4.0|When I went to see this movie in theaters, I knew that it wasn't going to be a very pretty movie, due to the trailers and TV spots I had seen. As the movie progressed, I was kind of regretting that I had decided to go to this movie, and at the same time, I was glad I went. This movie mainly focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. First we see him praying, then he gets taken away, and, well, I don't want to ruin the whole movie for those of you who haven't yet seen it. I am very anxious to get this movie on DVD this tuesday. If you are an Adult, I wouldn't really recommend showing this movie to your child, unless you really feel that they should see it. When the movie is over, try to put what they saw into context and tell them why it happened. Being a kid, that movie was a little much for me, and I'm not really sure If I'll be able to sit through it again.
0061015725|2.0|Prey follows the standard Crichton formula quite faithfully but much less capably than some of his past works.  I got the feeling while reading Prey that Crichton was just going through the motions and at the end of it I felt much less fulfilled than with some of his previous works.  As brain candy it worked but it doesn't achieve much more than that.  Prey can be an semi-entertaining 4-5 hour read but don't expect more than that. It is what it is.

B0002F6B7Y|5.0|\\"Dogville\\" is one of those movies that inspired hate within me. Don't misinterpret what I'm saying. I don't mean I hate the movie, and I don't simply mean I hate the characters. My feelings dwell deeper than that. What I mean is after watching it I had a hate for society. Few movies have challenged me in such a way.<br /><br /> One was Roman Polanski's \\"The Pianist\\". It's amazing that people would want to cause such harm to others. And \\"Focus\\". A movie about a man who is mistakenly seen as Jewish and now must encounter the same social problems.<br /><br /> Lars von Trier's \\"Dogville\\" will push many viewers to the limit. But Trier has high ambitions with this one. Von Trier is one of the most consistantly bold and daring filmmakers we have through such masterpieces as \\"Breaking the Waves\\" and \\"Dancer in the Dark\\".<br /><br /> \\"Dogville\\" is filmed as if it were played on stage. What does that mean? There are no \\"real\\" houses. People pretend to be opening doors. There is chalk with the name of streets on them. There is even one that has the word 'dog' written on it with a bone.<br /><br /> I admit at first this bothered me. I would have rather seen the actually locations, but, after a while you adjust. So don't harp on it. If you do, you'll stop yourself from enjoying the movie.<br /><br /> Nicole Kidman plays Grace a young woman on the run from gangsters and finds herself in the small town of Dogville. The first person she meets is Tom Edison, a morale crusader of the town. Tom wants to help her and has to try on convince the other citizens of town (including Lauren Bacall, Harriet Andersson, Chloe Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgard, and Patricia Clarkson) to help hide her from the gangsters.<br /><br /> And soon \\"Dogville' takes on the themes revenge, greed, lust, fear, and vindictiveness. It also describes the characters of this small town.<br /><br /> Many have called the film anti-American. Well, believe it or not I'm too smart to open that can of worms. So I'll just say the movie is anti-American to those who want it to be.<br /><br /> \\"Dogville\\" is one of the year's best films. It has a performance by Nicole Kidman that is arguably her bravest yet. But I can assure you she stands no chance of getting nominated for an Oscar for her work here. She would more likely be nominated for \\"The Stepford Wives\\" than this. Nor sadly will Trier's scrpit get nominated. It is more ambitious than any other script so far this year. It touches on more social problems than any other film except maybe \\"The Passion of the Christ\\". And there's little chance \\"Dogville\\" will be nominated for \\"Best Picture\\". It really is one of the most daring films you will see by one of the most daring filmmakers we have. I simply cannot praise the film enough.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: One of the year's best and most challenging films. Director Lars von Trier has made a sure fired masterpieces. The movie explores more issues than almost any other film I've seen.\\"Dogville\\" is one of the year's best films. It has a performance by Nicole Kidman that is arguably her bravest yet.

B00026YO36|5.0|I have been a fan of Mark's mostly after Screaming trees..I think his solo projects have always been filled with torturous self examining and quests. I just bought the new Bubblegum CD and absolutely love it. It is a bit different musically but is fantastic none the less, and the inclusion of Chris Goss on some tracks singing was a a great idea the two of their voices play off each other so well.\\"One Hundred Days \\" is the best song it has a bit of that western guitar sound/desperado dusty old creeking ghost town feel. I would however if you are new to mark lanegan and his voice and sound start with whiskey for the holy ghost that album. So why depart from Sub Pop?
B000001FZK|5.0|`Myrrhman' is gently hypnotic, apparently devoid of structure and impossibly delicate, the barely audible vocals only heightening the soothing, spacious nature of the music. `Ascension Day' is far more accessible, although that word barely functions in the context of this album. It draws the listener in slowly with its deceptively simple, chorus like turn at some points, yet descends into a carefully orchestrated inferno of intense noise, each instrument combining confidently to achieve a cacophonous overall effect. `After the Flood' the albums massive epic, incorporates touches of organ and a lengthy section of guitar feedback which is somehow more eloquent than a thousand solos.<br /><br />After the masterpiece 'Spirit of Eden' one had to wonder where Talk Talk could go. These songs illustrate the grand plan of Mark Hollis then, namely, his desire to fuse progressive touches with a pop-aesthetic with touches of jazz and free form experimentation to create something entirely without peer in the world of `rock', for want of a better word, music. `Laughing Stock' sees the band move further away from traditional song structures, musical ideas or conventional use of instruments. Hollise's genius is not his talent for taking a musical hook which can worm its way into your brain and never leave, and painting a jaw dropping aural tapestry around two or three such ideas out of which emerges a beast that, I suppose, I'd have to call a song. More, it is his ability to utilize the sound of a number of instruments, slotting them together in ways I'd never have thought possible, to produce an overall effect that is never short of stunning. One only has to listen to the driving percussion on `Ascension day' or `New Grass', then wonder at how the swathes of organ and harmonium, then the crescendos of harmonica, then the spiteful, dissonant points of guitar are fused on to a musical movement which seems to evolve like it is alive, rather than simply a band playing together.<br /><br />Despite all this, it is the fact that the music is as accessible as it undoubtedly is that assures this albums legendary status. There are no solos, no particularly long interludes, and certainly not a wasted second on the disc. Rather, the experimentation is in form, structure, voice, and the manner in which instrument combine, as I've mentioned. The song `Runeii' is of particular note, as it may be the only song I've heard to use space (yeah, silence) to drive its point home: somehow, despite the pleading, at times remarkably powerful vocals of Hollis, it is the tantalizing, carefully placed gaps in the flow which punctuate the song that lends it its sense of urgency, the sliding guitar lines only adding to this feeling. This, I believe, is the central focus of the album, and the apex of the bands vision: to use experimentation as a means of putting across a message in a new, original way, and hence heightening its power.<br /><br />This is a very important record. It has emotional depth and power rarely matched, and it progresses in the most profound way: no pretension, no wasted notes, no indulgence. Along with `Spirit of Eden' which is probably the place to start with this incarnation of the band, it reveals layers barely imagined, over time, and quickly becomes indispensable. I would urge anyone who reads this and feels they may like this sort of thing to please, please check this album out. Don't just take my word for it, repeat listens will unveil a masterpiece.te all this, it is the fact that the music is as accessible as it undoubtedly is that assures this albums legendary status.

0743506650|4.0|Not being a reader of horror, I had never read a Stephen King book before this one.  However, I have really come to look forward to his brutally honest and often hilarious monthly column in Entertainment Weekly magazine.  So, when a book chat pal recommended \\"On Writing\\" and further recommended the audio version, my interest was piqued.  I had a 14-hour round trip car trip coming up and really needed a book on tape that would keep my interest.  I ordered \\"On Writing\\" and off I went on my road trip.  I found myself smiling and sometimes laughing at King's reminisces of his childhood and his early works of writing in the first half of the book.  Having been writing as a hobby for 4 decades, I found his guidance on the tools of the writing trade very interesting and helpful.<br /><br />Other than finding out, mid-trip while going 70 MPH on I-70, that disk 7 of 8 was missing from the Audio CD package I bought (awww, maaaan!), I enjoyed every minute of the road trip while listening to this book.  Highly recommend it both as a memoir and as a treatise on the art and craft of writing.  One thing you can guarantee--you will hear it exactly as King thinks about it.  This man does NOT mince words!  I love his honesty and guts and I can't imagine listening to ANYONE read those words but him (the audio CD is read by King himself).
B00006IU73|5.0|I dont have much to add to a number of excellent reviews others have already penned for this album. However, I'd like to draw attention to the immaculate production, courtesy of Steven Wilson. He's evidently a perfectionist, and listening to the dense, layered soundscapes on this album it's hard to blame him. Check out the wall to wall melodies and luscious harmonies on the excellent `Lips of Ashes', the super cool guitar tone throughout `Wedding Nails', the crystal clear acoustic guitars on `Trains' or the cathartic, emotive strings on `Collapse the light into earth'.<br /><br />Every song here is a winner, thanks to impeccable songwriting, production, and playing. Gavin Harrisons tight, hard hitting, deceptively complex drumming is an inspiration. This really is an album for the future. Highest possible recommendation.
B000002UA0|5.0|to the nearly 300 reviews here? Nothing, really. It's true what they all say-this is an unqualified trippy masterpiece. If you have any interest at all in psychedelic pop, you must own this recording. It is one of the foundational works of the canon. It completely lives up to its reputation. <br /> <br />That said, I must add that it was a bit more whimsical and fey than I had expected, or that the Syd-era Floyd songs I'd heard before I bought Piper--Arnold Layne, See Emily Play (neither, alas, included here-see Relics), Interstellar Overdrive (which is actually an instrumental, not a song) and Astronomy Domini--had led me to believe. In fact, you could argue that with his decidedly androgynous style Syd was a precursor of glam (as further evidence, Bowie did a cover of See Emily Play on one of his later albums). Much of the time Syd sounds like a gay Mod on acid. Lots and lots and lots of acid. Not that that's a bad thing. Well, apparently the acid part didn't work out so well for Syd in the long run. But in 1967 it certainly seemed to have helped him create an utterly unique work of art that will continue to be listened to for generations to come.
B0000024V2|5.0|This work is some of the most progressive sounds ever released by \\"The Winter Brothers\\". When it was first released on Vinyl LP it was a three sided album (side four was blank). The producer had too much music for a single album, but not enough to fill four sides. While trying to decide which songs to drop (to fit on to one LP), they just said, \\"there is nothing that NEEDS to be dropped as each song was outstanding\\". The band was gone from the studio so they couldn't get any more tracks. Ultimately it was decided, release every tune recorded and leave side four blank. I owned the original LP set and I'm glad that they used all of the material. The result was in my opinion, the very best collaboration ever released by Johnny and Edgar together. You will not be disappointed!!
B000001GQY|5.0|There was renowned Russian conductor who found Richter \\"oppressive\\". Gilels was never as \\"oppressive\\" as Richter albeit both were at a time taught by the same teacher and both were very demanding, each in their own way.  Gilels's was a giant with an emphasis on the whole range, on each and voice (and sometimes each note) on the piano. And Jochum, being an authoritative Bruchnerian, handled his part so well and with so much grace and poetry.     There is a saying that No. 2 is essentially about the inspirations Brahms incepted from the awesome beauty of the Alps when he was approaching 50.  Perhaps such background doesn't count at all, for here we obviously have much more than than that, so much so that no one could ever have called the composer a light hearted one at all. True,  great music is open to all kinds of interpretation after all.     And here we have absolute excitement from both concerti, from  the pianist as well as from the orchestra. And the pianist's tone is so amazing throughout the range... The two pieces are quite a sensation.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is THE album to buy.  It's a story all in one cd.  Good job Christina.  I'm proud of you.
B0002I831S|5.0|Rating this set less than 5 stars because you think Paramount is ripping you off is silly. Who didn't know that they would release the season sets? I have waited a long time for this set. The sound was remastered to provide for the Dolby 5.1. As soon as I get the set I am canceling cable TV. Who needs it now that real Trek is on DVD? No need to watch the butcher editing job done to it by the sci-fi (so called) channel. <br /> <br />Put your phasers on FUN, watch the DVDs, enjoy and remember - Live long and prosper. We come in peace. Shoot to kill!
B0002DKCMG|3.0|Eurotrip is a pretty good comedy that relies on stereotypes far too much, but in reality, what high school/teenager movie doesn't.  Everything seems to be going great for high school senior, Scotty, as he graduates and prepares for his last summer before college.  Things change when his girlfriend, Fiona, dumps him.  In the breakup aftermath, Scotty tells off his German pen pal in a drunken stupor in an email only to discover that the pen pal is a hot German girl.  Along with three friends, Scotty heads to Europe to win back his lost love.  This is by no means a great movie, but still it has its moments.  Lots of raunchy comedy as the quartet travels to London, Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, and several other places.  They run into soccer hooligans, violent robot mimes, French street thieves, and so much more.  Don't take this movie seriously and you will probably enjoy it.   <br /> <br />  Scott Mechlowicz plays high school senior Scott Thomas who travels to Europe with three friends to find the German girl he unknowingly told off.  Jacob Pitts is very funny as Scott's horny friend, Cooper Harris, who looks at the trip to Europe as a grand sexual oddysey.  Michele Trachtenberg and Travis Wester play Jenny and Jamie, a pair of brother and sister twins.  Jenny is the quiet, unassuming friend and Jamie has memorized a guidebook so he will not miss anything during the trip.  Eurotrip has plenty of great cameos including Matt Damon as a punk rocker, Lucy Lawless as a sexual dominatrix Cooper meets in Amsterdam, Vinnie Jones as a Manchester United soccer hooligan, Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Hytner, Diedrich Bader, and Fred Armisen.  Also starring are Kristen Kruek and Jessica Bohrs.  The Unrated DVD offers widescreen presentation, audio commentary, a gag reel, and deleted scenes.  For a funny movie with plenty of nudity and raunchy moments, check out Eurotrip!
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|This CD is terrible.  I bought it hoping that it would rock like the single, but the rest is moody, meandering, poorly produced and sung work.  Moody is fine if it's Massive Attack or Joy Division, but not if it's a typically bad Cure cd, as this resembles.  I had to check the credits to see if, as is often the case, someone different produced the single, the excellent \\"Take Me Out\\", while some unfocused, art school  novice did the rest.  But that isn't the case, so I don't know what accounts for the difference.  Either way, I'm trading it in for the CD single, as I just don't want it on my shelf.  It's that bad.
B000002J09|5.0|It's become quite clear to me that this band was one of the best of all time and also that we will never see another rock band sell over 100 million copies in North America. I know a lot of people my age who only listen to classic rock. PERIOD. Now why is our youth turning away from new rock? Because most mew rock bands are really bad! I've never heard anyone today on the radio who can play like Jimmy Page, Hendrix, Clapton, Harrison or Dave Gilmour. The closest are Mark Tremonti, Slash, Dan Hawkins and Mike McCready. The rest can only play power chords and do crappy solos. Sorry guys, ROCK IS DEAD! And that really sucks! But Led Zeppelin will forever be remembered.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|i couldnt agree more with Fading to Black's review on this album. like he said, screaming lyrincs at the top of your lungs is not heavy. i used to listen to slipknots first cd when i was 11, thinking they were sooo scary. then i realized after seeing them play on conan o brien, they cant play for their lives. the band doesnt even care how good they play, all they care about is if their headbanging is synchronized or if theyre heavy enough by using double bass for every other second. every song consists of nothing but idiotic lyrics that make no sense, unessesary beeps and boops by electronics or turntables, and again, annoying double bass. please do us all a favor, dont waste your money on this album.
B0002IU988|4.0|First of all, this singer does not suck or sound like Chris Cornell. Second of all, Scott Stapp really, and I MEAN really sucks! This band is good because Scott Stapp is gone.
B00007ELEL|4.0|If you like your humor a little subtle and hip, you'll go for the Bridges and Moore characters big time, and want more.  If you like slapstick, in your face funny that keeps saying, \\"Isn't that funny?, come on, laugh\\", you'll love all the scenes with Goodman.  Its in that great category of failed box office/cult classic movies that by definition are to be appreciated, OK swooned over, by a minority of views who \\"get it\\".  This one is probably more accessible than most in that category, and definitely has its moments.
B00003CXS4|4.0|TAke full advantage of your DVD's ability to make subtitles because you'll need it with all of the accents - especially Brad Pitt's.<br /><br />To make it short, I'll mention what I liked:<br /><br />-I liked the use of commentary by Turkish and Tommy during the movie - they serve as the de facto narrators.<br /><br />-I liked the rapid-cut intro and the way the director used the security cameras to show us the progress of the diamond thieves during the opening credits.<br /><br />-I really liked the Brad Pitt character.<br /><br />-the dog was fun (and hungry).<br /><br />-I liked the way all of the characters were sleazy and yet markedly different from one another.<br /><br />-I like the fact that the DVD includes deleted scenes with commentary. I did not like the fact that the commentary usually did not tell me why the scene was deleted.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and deserves its place as one of the greatest films to ever be made. The story and characters are not spectacular (above par yes, but not spectacular), it's the way the director Hayao Miyazaki presents the story that makes Spirited Away so special. Miyazaki's colour pallet for the film gives it a certain edge over other animated movies, the film is truly art caught on film, the animation is spectacular and beyond Walt Disney's dreams. <br /> <br />The detail in the surroundings is astounding from the architecture of the bath house to the costume designs, that takes an interesting but quite simplistic story to something truly magical. There is so much feeling enveloped in every scene of this movie that it easily draws you into Chihiro's quest to escape the bath house and save her parents. <br /> <br />One thing that may deter people from this film is that it is very Japanese, and gives an insightful view into their culture. Certain cultural references may leave people misreading certain aspects of the film. Such as one magazine critic who thought that the bath house was similar to the red-light district. Even though bath houses are extremely common throughout Japan, have been so for hundreds of years and are very much an ordinary part of Japanese life. Even though some cultural references may cause some misunderstandings, the story of Chihiro is truly universal and can be understood by everyone, as this is a childrens film afterall. <br /> <br />There are a few scary bits in the film that may scare the kids, so Parental Guidance is advised. But this is a true gem, and gives the new slur of CG effects movies a good kicking, and shows what makes a good film. Disney may have forgotten how to make animated movies over the past thirty years (with a few exceptions) but Studio Ghibli is here to show that you can put all the money you want into making more realistic looking CG movies, but a great story and artful direction will win out overall.
B0002DB52M|1.0|I will go out on a limb here and just call it a \\"dog.\\" I was surprised it was in the form of a play with a theater-style set. I got over that. There was some good acting, but it was mostly \\"play\\" acting. I even grew tired of that as the film crawled along for three hours and got a little grumpy as it slowly loped downhill. I was hoping for some more positive resolution. I did have a good laugh at the ending. Serves them right. In short: I had enough \\"lectures\\" from all the art films I suffered through in the 1960s, when I was naive. I have no excuse now. I must apologize for my opinion to those who found substance in this film, but I consider it a real waste of my time. This is not how I want to be entertained.
B00005JMYG|5.0|This movie continues the recent \\"movie mafia\\" showdown of Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson. Even if it is cameos (Only one member missing, mr. owen wilson.) Absolute 10 in entertainment value. From the frivolous littering to the \\"yogging\\", the whole experience is worth watching it twice. I belly laughed my way through much of the film with heavy silent heaves toward the massive fight scene. Vince Vaughn makes a glorious appearence as a rival newscaster with is seedy glances and heavily satirical lines \\"did your mommy tell you it was special and different from everyone elses?\\" I feel a lot of well earned ad lib. Ferrell and Rudd really make the newsteam click. As well as applegate in a shiny new role as a comedian. So happy to see her move up the ladder. I hardly ever think of her as a \\"bundy\\".  Fabulous. Cant wait for the whole outtake bonus reel on the DVD.
B000000OPZ|5.0|By the time the 80's had rolled around Whitesnake had been making albums for about decade, so they had time to perfect their craft.1987 was finally their year, 1984's Slide it In had became a minor hit, which helped pave the way for the 1987 to become a smash hit. The opener of the album is Crying in the Rain, which had originally appeared on their 1982 album Saints and Sinners, Here I go Again was also a rerecording of a song that appeared on Saints and Sinners. Besides Crying in the Rain, and Here I go Again, other highlights include The Still of the Night,Give me all your love, and the rest of the songs are awesome too! Whitesnake is the essential 1980's album, buy it today!
B00005K9LM|5.0|Judas Priest's Defenders Of The Faith record is, simply put, astounding. It has all sorts of redeeming qualities. For instance: the riffing is superb, as are the bass lines. Halford's vocals are amazing, as usual. Drumming is great too. It's actually got several tracks with a great influence of thrash/speed metal. Let's break down the tracks one by one.<br /><br />1. Freewheel Burning: A great opener, it kicks you right in the face, which is how a lot of the best metal records open up. Solo is insane!<br /><br />2. Jawbreaker: Another fast one, bass line is amazing! I like how they make the sound effect of a time bomb with the hi-hat.<br /><br />3. Rock Hard, Ride Free: A bit of a slower number, but still crunchy, with a great hook.<br /><br />4. The Sentinel: A slow intro leads into another frantic speed metal tune. Solos are definetely at their best here.<br /><br />5. Love Bites: Once more, a great mid-tempo rocker. Kind of an eerie little intro. Listen for Rob's little death growl near the end!<br /><br />6. Eat Me Alive: Another frantic speed metal tune. Very heavy, but the solo is nothing special.<br /><br />7. Some Heads Are Gonna Roll: Another slower one, but it's got such a great intro, who cares about the tempo?<br /><br />8. Night Comes Down: Almost like a ballad. Probably my personal least favorite. A bit too slow.<br /><br />9. Heavy Duty: This is one half of a whole song, and it's got the great fist pumping atmosphere of such songs as the Saxon classic \\"Denim And Leather\\" or the Manowar classic \\"Blow Your Speakers.\\"<br /><br />10. Defenders Of The Faith: The second half, continuing with the fist pumping atmosphere, but the lyrics are just repetitive crys of \\"We are defenders of the faith!\\" Oh well, at least they defend the metal faith, which is good!<br /><br />I hope you have been convinced to buy this unbelievable album. Also, if you went to this years Ozzfest like me, you got a chance to see them on their first big tour since Halford re-joined! They still can rock after 30 years!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This is every Matrix fan's dream. It has every movie and bonus featues coming out the wazoo. I already have the three movies, but there is no way I am going to pass up an opertunity like this. You won't be sorry (unless you hated the movies). I think the bonus features alone warrent you buying this. The critic's commentaries shouldn't be missed. If you are a matrix fan like I am, you will definetly hate yourself for missing this collectors set.
B00005JNEI|1.0|one of the worst lies i have ever heard of.would rather see a  story of Unfit for command on Kerry.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I decided to watch this movie after reading all the big hype about it and wasn't too surprised to see that I had some dissatisfaction.   #1.Common laborer meets rich preacher's daughter, they fall in love but before things develop he's called off to war.#2.He's wounded in battle, while in the hospital gets a letter from the lady begging him to come home. #3. The bulk of the movie concerns Inman's dificulties in getting back to Cold Mountain and Miss Ada's difficulties inn adjusting to life without him.  I found the story interesting, it was just so very long that I sometimes wished it had been trimmed somewhere.   Jude Law did an especially good job with his American accent and his role, Renee Zellwegger portrayed an interesting but somewhat irritating characted. I had forgotten that Natalie Portman was in the cast, her role is short but quite a change of pace for me.  It appeared to me that the producers went all out in detailing the movie, things such as Miss Ada with ink on her left hand from writing a letter (Nicole Kidman is left handed)blood on the ground, weapons,buildings, lot's of things.  I think I'll be getting a copy, it just won't be my top priority.
B000003TAB|4.0|Coming off the success of their 1991 megasmash album, \\"Nevermind,\\" Nirvana released \\"Incesticide\\" at the end of 1992. It's a collection of rare tracks: demos, rare singles and B-sides, and BBC Sessions. While a few tracks are a little TOO wild and ragged-sounding, such as \\"Beeswax\\" and \\"Hairspray Queen,\\" most of it is awesome, powerful garage rock (and NO band on the face of the earth did garage rock better than Nirvana). My personal faves include the thunderous rock of \\"Dive,\\" the catchy \\"Sliver\\" (the best-known track on the album), \\"Been A Son,\\" the clever cover of Devo's \\"Turnaround,\\" the rip-roaring \\"Mexican Seafood,\\" the big, swaggering rock of \\"Big Long Now,\\" and the all-time Nirvana classic, \\"Aneurysm.\\" However, the liner notes on the inside of the CD by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain are, admittedly, a little disturbing, as Kurt makes it perfectly clear to the reader that he was NOT enjoying his newfound success all that much, a fact confirmed by his tragic suicide less than two years later. Still, don't let this stop you from checking out this excellent Nirvana CD. If you're a diehard Nirvana fan, then \\"Incesticide\\" is truly a must-have.
B000127LW2|4.0|I have been a Star Trek fan for over 30 years, having watched TOS as a kid in the 1960's and 1970's. I eagerly anticipated and enjoyed all the motion picture releases as well as TNG series. I always though the series projected hope and the best aspirations of mankind.  <br /> <br />Until now I had never given STV a chance. I recall watching an episode or two on TV, but I didn't like the politically correct idea of a female captain, and I thought the basic premise was idiotic. In retrospect my thinking was the only thing idiotic.  <br /> <br />I now find Janeway a very believable leader, and she could probably give ol' James Tiberius a run for his money. The premise, when you stop and think about it, is genius because it's really just TOS and TNG in reverse. Instead of \\"going where no man has gone before\\", these folks are just trying to get home. <br /> <br />After finishing the first three discs of Season 1 this looks very promising. Many reviewers have indicated Season 1 is weaker (as you might expect) than the following seasons. If that's true I can't wait to buy the rest. My favorite episode so far is \\"Heros and Demons\\", which was crafted in the very best Trek tradition. <br /> <br />My rating of four stars was due to the packaging, which as many have noted seems somewhat cheap and easily damaged. I would concur the retail price is out of line, but I purchased mine used. Other than that, Paramount keep up the good work! Maybe I'll even give DS9 a try. <br /> <br />   <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Its the best scifi and western rolled into one.  Being a big Joss Whedon fan, I was excited to see him do scifi.  Even with the network's efforts to bury the show, it shined.  I had all episodes recorded, but the box set is so shiny!!  I preordered it as soon as it was available.  The writing, the special effects, the scenery all top notch.  Not to mention the cast and how seamlessly they embody their characters.  Normally it takes a couple episodes (or a season) for the actors to fit their rolls and be comfortable, but from the moment its starts you believe. Its real, its gritty, and not always pretty, but buy this set and you will rewatch it again and again, I have every couple months since getting it.  Sometimes a fav ep and sometimes the whole 14 episodes. Most of the commentary and extras are good also. Go to the firefly board, we have parties just watch it again.  some great barbques,etc. I have lent my discs (conveniently packaged separately so I always have one) and have a 95% conversion rate, with 75% buying their own copy after watching all mine.  The finishing touch will be the movie(s) first to be released in april 2005, already great buzz going around.  With our fav cast back, Joss writing and directing.  Also makes great gifts for people you like.    <br />If I could have one series only for the rest of my life this would go to the dessert island with me, it will be harder to pick my author to bring for books.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie can be viewed from two different perspectives. On a superficial level, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" can be viewed as simply an entertaining movie. On that level, the movie easily scores a 5/5. Moore very skilfully manipulates (and I don't mean this in a negative way) our emotions as film viewers. One moment we find ourselves laughing or shaking our heads bemused by yet another Bush malapropism, the next moment outraged as Moore makes his case that the war was merely a way of finishing off what his father began in 1991 and as a way of enacting what many civil libertarians consider draconian limits on personal freedoms in the name of public safety. For me, the most poignant parts of the movie revolves around a woman from Flint Michigan who's children were serving in the military at the time of the Iraqi war. We watch unfold this mother's progression from a supporter of the President Bush and his war efforts to someone who, after being transformed through  tragedy, wholly rejects the President's case for the war in Iraq.    The other perspective is from the observer who coldly examines the facts as they are presented. From this perspective, I have to give the movie a 4/5, not because it was not factual, but because Moore really doesn't contribute a great deal new to the story (save the personal stories of some of the people presented in the documentary). For example, I watched a CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company) documentary on \\"The Fifth Estate\\" which detailed the family connections between the Bush's, Bin Laden's, and the Saudi Royal Family, a full year before \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" arrived in theatres. The same can be said of the BBC expose of the Florida election scandal; the BBC documentary came out only a few months after G.W. Bush became President. Rather, Moore re-packages this information, adds some human interest stories, and skilfully injects humour, to create a very good, though not entirely original in content,  documentary.    Does this movie have an ideological slant? Certainly, and to expect otherwise would be unrealistic. Does Moore want Bush defeated in the next election? Absolutely, and to his credit he's said as such on numerous occasions. However, I would ask those individuals who have given this film a negative review to do one thing. If you say he's lying, please provide examples, as Mr. Moore has documented his claims. Unfortunately, I have yet to read a negative review which claims Moore is lying in \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" to provide evidence to back up this claim.
0385336810|5.0|I enjoyed the book I finised it in 2 nights.  I am a little disapointed in the ending.  Maybe there will be a part 2.
B00005JN2F|3.0|I know rarely does a movie stand up to the strength of the book.  I believe the first movie represented the first book well.  It didn't  strickly follow the first movie but represented the spirit behind the book. <br /> <br />The second movie was definitely a spin off of the first movie and did not follow the storyline of the book series.  There was hardly none or no representation from the book series.  It was a strong action movie, with a decent storyline that would of held up on its own even if you didnt use the Bourne storyline.  I would spend the money again to see this movie if I had to do it over again.
B0002IU988|4.0|My husband and I believe this is a tremendous effort by the newly formed band that we felt it appropriate to submit a positive review.  Unfortunately the negative reviews stem from comparing Alter Bridge to Creed which is comparing apples to oranges.  Creed was a terrific band with Scott's voice arguably guiding the success of the band.  Alter Bridge's first album is a continuation of the deep emotional music that Creed had in their songs but the singing by Myles brings the new band to a new and different sound. Many of the songs contain notes in the higher octaves, which admittedly concerned me at first.  But as with anything that is new and different if you give the album a chance it begins to really catch on and you begin to apreciate Myles' talent.  Frankly there arent many albums out there where I can genuinely say that I can listen to the entire album without having to skip some of the songs.  Although I listen to the album from the fist track to the last, I have my favorites of course.  The challenge that the new group has to deal with is to come out from the former band's shadow before it can make a name for itself.  Regarding Myles, you will note that he is a true singer in that he is not only able to cover the octaves but changes key quite effortlessly.   <br /> <br />It took me a longer time to enjoy \\"Weathered\\" than it did for me to take a liking to this new eveolution of Rock. Assuming it catches on you may see more of a switch from bands just screaming their songs to actually singing them.  (Great guitar playing doesnt hurt either)
B00004XMS0|5.0|This is a great buy! All four movies in this giftset except the last one, BATMAN AND ROBIN are execelent. <br />Batman (BATMAN 1) starring Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton is by far the best one. Loaded with action, supsense, and scenes that are a fest to the eye. It has perfect special effects, great diologue, the best villain, and great acting. <br />Batman Returns (BATMAN 2)starring Michael Keaton and Danny Devito. This also proves Michael Keaton and Tim Burton are geniuses. It has, again, great special effects, action, and another wonderful villains set, including the Penguin and Max Shreck. Michelle Phfeiffer is great and sexier than ever as michevious Catwoman, and this movie is definately the second best in the series. <br />Batman Forever (BATMAN 3) starring Val Kilmer and Jim Carrey. It was dissapointing to see Time burton go, but this movie is still just as great as the first two. The damsel, Nichol Kidman, is outstanding, even better than Kim Basigner and Michelle, (though they were great too). Jim Carrey is great as the riddler, and Tommee Lee Jones is the perfect sinsiter two-face. It has theb est special effects, but it does tend to go on too much about Bruce Wayne's parents' death.  <br />Batman and Robin (BATMAN 4) starring George Clooney. This is great too, though the storyline is sort of dumb. It has great special effects, and has great acting, including Arnold (the governator) as Mr. Freeze, who is the perfect sinister villain. His ice blast effects are excelent, and Uma Thurman is hot and evil as plant girl Poison Ivy. With the introduction of wonderful Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) this movie is great! <br /> <br />So, there you have it. This collection is a great choice. And like I said, though the fourth was dissapointing, the other three movies are great!
0792833260|4.0|<br /> <br /> This past weekend I watched a movie called Rain Man. The movie was about Charlie Babbit, A Money hungry car dealer that finds out he has a brother after his fathers death. His brother Raymond. Charlie was on his way to a vacation with his girlfriend when he gets a call from his co-worker that his father has died. He goes to his funeral and during the will reading he finds out his father left three million dollars to his older son Raymond. <br />Charlie finds Raymond in a hospital where he is being taken care of. Charlie is told that Raymond is autistic. Charlie not really knowing what that is takes Ray back to L.A with him for a scheme to get what he calls his half of his dads money. Ray and Charlie go on a road trip to L.A and have to make stops in hotels so Raymond can watch the peoples court and eat his fish sticks and cheese balls. In a psychiatrist office Charlie learns about Raymonds ability's with numbers. Shortly after that he finds out that Ray can count cards, so they do what any normal person would do, they go to Las Vegas. In Vegas, they win large sums of money. Charlie runs into his girlfriend and he tells her what they're doing. Raymond tells a woman that works at the casino that they are counting cards and they have to leave Las Vegas. Charlie soon realizes that he loves Ray and is not just a way to make money after Raymond tells Charlie that he was around and was the Rain Man who would sing to a two  year old Charlie. Charlie thought that the Rain Man was a figment of his imagination. When it is time for Rays custody hearing Charlie proves that he cares more about Ray then he does the money and Ray goes back to his home at his hospital. <br /> I enjoyed this movie a lot, but there were a few things that I hated. I hated Charlie's girlfriend Susanna. Her voice made me mad. I hated it, I wanted to have her voice dubbed by someone else. I often asked my self if it was necessary that she was french. I also think they should have talked about the Rain Man more. If they would have done that, the movie would have been better and a little deeper. <br /> I chose to watch this movie because Ray reminded me of friends I have. Im not trying to be mean but it is true. During parts of the movie I could imagine my friends doing things Ray would do. That gave me a little schema for the movie. I feel Rain Man is one of the most important films in history. Rain Man open the world up to movies and t.v shows about mentally challenged people. Without Rain Man there would be no I Am Sam, no Radio, No simple life and no Newlyweds. Now in Hollywood if a person is a little mentally challenged the movie or show will be box office gold or get great ratings if it is a t.v show. That is all thanks to Rain Man, a great movie.  <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone that has a sense of humor and would not find it offensive to laugh at a person with a disability. Don't worry you wont go to hell if you laugh at Ray.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|You know what cracks me up the most about this movie?  That when MTV does MTV cribs all the rappers and I mean ALL the rappers have SHRINES to Scarface and/or Pacino.  Whew <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     Ok now on to the movie....frankly speaking its not one of my favorites of all time....they went a bit overkill on the violence and cursing.  But you have to admire the messages it shows.  Tony Montana is the king of street knowledge:  'First you got to make the money,  then you get the power,  then when you get the power,  THEN you get the women'...then theres 'All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I dont break em for no one'.   <br /> <br /> <br />     But to me,  the BIGGEST unsaid message comes at the end of the movie when Tony messes up the assasination and Sosa sends a hit squad after him,  and the message is,  one little mistake can cost you everything.  On that note,  4 stars.  A classic,  prepare for Scarface its unforgettable.
B00029NKUG|5.0|Excellent movie! It's loaded with insider jokes.  We were laughing out loud the whole movie.  For Americans or anyone else unfamiliar with East Germany it's still a fabulous movie (just not as funny).  You have to see it. \\"Unsere Heimat...\\" :)
0441003257|5.0|When I had heard that two of my favorite authors were getting together to write a book, I got excited. Then people started reading it before I could get to it, and all I heard was enormous praise. My expectations for this one were extremely high--in fact, to live up to what I had built up in my mind, this would have to be practically the best book I'd ever read. <br /> <br />Needless to say, it surpassed my expectations by a long shot.
0553582445|4.0|I wasn't partial to the \\"Mad Ships\\" series, but I did like the \\"Farseer\\" trilogy, so I thought that this was a nice return for Hobb. I'm always partial to the 1st-person narrative, and this is the trademark for the FitzChivalry character. Personally, I think the magical elements of the story tend to prop up the plot and drown out the characters, but I think that's just a personal bias. The underlying story of a man ostracized and outcast for differences imposed at birth is a nice parable for modern discrimination.
B00004XMS0|3.0|First of all, I want to say that the first two Batman films (Batman and Batman Returns) should be rated at a perfect 5 stars... but, Joel Schumucker (whatever his name is) single handly ruined this near perfect series.  It really probably started with the critics nick-picking at Batman Returns, claiming it was \\"too dark\\".  Though the first Batman is a classic and arguably the best, Batman Returns was on its level.  I think I'm brain washed to tell people \\"the 1st one is the best\\", but in reality watch the second way more.  I think I enjoyed images.  I think the 2nd movie had some real (super) artistic scenes, like when Penguin went to his parents grave site or when Batman and Penguin have a sick conversation in fron of Shreks Department store.  Again, both of these movies are hott to the point where you really dont even have to judge which one is better.  If you own one, you should own the other.   <br />    Now, for the last two film (Batman Forever and Batman and Robin).  Wack.  Batman and Robin is one of the worst films ever made... period.  Everyone seems to agree on this, but everyone debates on whether Batman Forever was that bad.  Yes!!!  Batman and Robin takes the cake, but there were signs in Batman Forever to let you know what direction the new director was taking the films in.  The Director, Joel, figured Batman Forever worked so lets give them more it.  Batman Forever was colorful, so they added more colors in Batman and Robin.  The Successful Batman Forever added corny humor so the Director added even more corny humor.  There is a pattern here.  Val Kilmers Batman made a safe (being stolen by Helicopter) drop from the sky and land perfectly in place and everyone applauded.  Was I the only one that thought this was a bit corny and unrealistic... even for comic book film.  Do I even have to mention the ice skates in Batman and Robins boots in the last film.  I agree that some of the actors were off in these late two installments.  Val Kilmer was a bit dry, but to be honest with you I could of put up with it in a Tim Burton style movie.  Plus, he was cool looking in the suit compared to George Clooney.  Clooney looked like a guy at a hollween party with a Batman outfit on.  Clooney played Bruce Wayne extremely well... he acting was truly convincing, but his Batman was terrible.  Both of these actors failed to create two seperate characters for Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Kilmer was Batman even when he playing Bruce Wayne and Clooney was Bruce Wayne even when he was Playing Batman.  In the first films, Michael Keaton changed his voice, the way he walked, stood, everything.  It even looked like he held his mouth differently.  (side note:  even the cartoon Batman changes his voice between the two characters).  Why Joel failed to implement this?  Its hard for me to blame the actors... even though Mr. Freeze was a bit corny... it reminded me of Arnolds one liners in earlier films like Commando and Running Man.  No, I blame on the Director for how these movies came out.  Though he gave another reason for quitting, I think Michael Keaton left the series because he saw where things were going.  He had started production with Forever... fitted for the new Batman suit and everything.  Its hard to beleive that he would just up leave after deciding to start because he doesnt want be known for Batman forever.  I was a kid when these movies dropped, but even then I felt that he had quit because the script or the set (or something) was wack.   <br />    Anywayz, Batman and Batman Returns are great films.  If you find the four pack for under thirty, why not buy it.  Other wise dont waist your money on this set.  You can buy the first two for fairly cheap and you will more than satisfied.  I gave this set a 3 rating due to the fact 1)The last two films are terrible and 2) There were no special features on these disc.  I bought Superman, which had at least one terrible movie in its set, but It was well worth my money due to the specialfeatures. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I think all the people writing negative ads for this item, which has NOT even been released yet, need to get a life.  Unless you are related to George Lucas, stole a copy, downloaded an illegal version, I doubt that you have actually seen what this DVD special edition will have.  Get a life, and a clue!  According to Lucas's interview, these DVDs are intended to be his true vision of how he wanted to make the movies.  He had neither the finance nor technology to make the movies as he had them in his head some 25 yrs ago.  If he did, not only would he have told the stories in the manor he did, but he would also have had the special effects \\"tweaked\\", as one of you put it, exactly how he wanted.  Get a life, and give it a rest.  Wait until the movies come out next month, then cry and complain all you want.  Until then, chillout!  You have NO idea what is going on in his head, neither do I.  What he did was amazing all those years ago with the 3 movies, especially Star Wars, considering what was available to him at the time.  If he could do now what he could have done back then, he would have.  Just because he is adding these new \\"gimics\\" as others of you have said, does not mean it should take away from the story.  It merely adds to what is already an incredible story and movie.  To that end, I think its about time he got around the releasing these on DVD, they all great movies should be viewed.  For those of you thinking Lucas has no sole, think about what he is trying to do with these \\"new\\" movies.  The story will still be there, but now it will be told an even better way.  Also, considering what many producers these days pass off as a price for some of these movies, I think the price for this DVD is fairly reasonable.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson did a stellar job portraying the final days of Jesus Christ's last days. Some may protest that it was overly violent; however, Gibson did not put in as much as what really happened. I doubt the American (or European) market is ready to see how truly brutal Christ's death really was. Yes, it was violent, but did you want to see the candy coated version of his death? I think not. Props to Mel for his sensitivity to the matter. I believe it could have been more graphic, but Mr. Gibson wouldn't have wanted his entire audience vomiting in the aisles. A+

B0000BWVCM|5.0|You have to hand it to Stan Lee and the gang at Marvel Comics: overseeing the movies made from their comics, they've made sure that Hollywood's done a bang-up job, both literally and figuratively. This is true both for Bryan Singer's \\"X-Men\\" movies and Sam Raimi's \\"Spider-Man\\" series. In both series of movies, the special effects are absolutely state-of-the-art, and the action sequences are a total wow. But they are also well-written and impeccably cast, with characters an audience can actually care about. \\"X2: X-Men United\\" has the same advantage as \\"Spider-Man 2\\"--since most of the main characters were already introduced in the first film, the sequel can get down to the business of creating an engrossing story for them. In the case of \\"X2,\\" the story hinges on a dastardly plot to frame the mutants for an assassination attempt on the President, leading to a worldwide hue-and-cry against them. All the old characters are back, and there are some intriguing new ones--Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the ostensible assassin, and the hissable Stryker (Brian Cox), who seeks revenge on the mutants. In any case, Bryan Singer takes as much care with the performances and the characters--their interrelations and motivations--as he does with the makeup and the action sequences, and it pays off big. All the performers are very good, but the three top-lined ones--Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman--stand out. It's wonderful to see such consummate classical actors as Stewart and McKellen play antagonists, particularly such semi-friendly ones as Xavier and Magneto. As Wolverine, Jackman--a sort of Mad Max/Snake Plissken type among the mutants--is riveting. If you compare what he does here with what he does as Curly in \\"Oklahoma!\\", you can only conclude that here is a superstar in the making.
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|Underworld starts out with a long action sequence. Things do slow down enough for us to learn that our hero is a vampire by the name of Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale, who has devoted her unlife to destroying lycanthropes. Selene stumbles upon a conspiracy between the vampire leader, Kraven, and the werewolf leader, Lucian, which involves a human named Michael, who is a host to a strain of some strain of plague that is never explained. Fearing that Kraven's actions may place the vampires in jeopardy, Selene does the unthinkable; she awakens the ancient vampire noble, Viktor so he can stop Kraven.     In the middle of the movie we move away from some of the action and we get our characters doing a lot of talking, plotting, and running through dark wet streets. We get all of our back-story of how the vampire/werewolf war got started in the first place via flashbacks. And there's a forbidden romance budding between Selene and Michael.     The movie looks sufficiently offbeat to be interesting, although the muted colors and lack of anything resembling bright light becomes does get a little old. Be nice to see what the vampires did when the sun was up. Kate Beckinsale does look dangerous and sexy in a skintight leather suit, but there is not much acting for her to do in this film. Scott Speedman doesn't need to do anything more than exude a primal wildness, which he succeeds at. And everyone else has to appear sinister.     Even though, I found Underworld be an entertaining view. The big battle at the end is fun, although the final scene seems to be an introduction for a sequel. So get your popcorn, and watch the movie. You will not be sorry...though it is no one I will be watching multiple times.
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi by Yann Martel is a pretty good book. Like so many good books it gets you, really gets you, with the ending. Great \\"twist\\" ending. Spectacular ending. Triumphant ending. I just finished it and I can't stop thinking about it. The questions the novel raises in the subtlest of ways stick to my conscious, rising from the subconscious, begging me to mull them over again and again. Fiction meets philosophy without being preachy.  <br /> <br />Basic plotline breakdown as follows: A young boy named Pi Patel from Pondicherry, India grows up in a zoo run by his family. At an early age Pi is taught a terrible lesson to make him fear and respect the zoo's most dangerous guest: a 450lb Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Pi grows up fascinated by the animals in his family's zoo and by religion. Both of these fascinations prove invaluable assets in the most terrible ordeal of his life, which is the bulk of the story. This ordeal includes his family moving to Canada, the sinking of a cargo ship, and 277 days in a life boat adrift in the Pacific Ocean--a life boat containing two beings: Pi Patel & Richard Parker. <br /> <br />This is a great story, but like everything else in this world it is imperfect. The greatest complaint I have is with the author's writing style. Mr. Martel uses the passive voice much too often, seems fearful of sentences longer than 10 or 12 words, and lacks any real grasp of figurative language--he tends to use three or four mediocre metaphors when one decent metaphor would suffice. However, in Mr. Martel's defense, the story is told in the first person through the voice of Pi Patel so this less than engrossing (and sometimes downright annoying) narrative style may be to emphasize this is a \\"real\\" story, which so often lack the touch of a gifted authorial mind. I'd say Life of Pi would be an excellent book for 13-15 year olds and would open up some interesting discussion in regards to the nature of fiction for a book club or 9th grade English class. And if you're one who won't let less than stellar style hinder your appetite for a good yarn with some interesting views on religion and zoos, then I'd say definitely give Life of Pi a read.
0060977493|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this book is an ambitious assembly of first-novel prose. It is not for everyone because it's not a quick read. As I worked my way through this sad tale set in modern India, I felt sometimes pleased with the author's poetic turns and sometimes annoyed as the wordplay detracted from the story telling. My biggest problem with the book, however, was that most of the characters were such unpleasant human beings. There were few lovable or decent people in the book. I will not be rereading this book because I don't want to spend more time with these characters. I sometimes felt like I was taking medicine rather than being entertained. But it was good enough that I will probably read Roy's next novel to see how she has progressed. BTW, I was quite impressed with a speech that Roy gave recently describing how many people in the world see the present American administration. She is perceptive and a gifted speaker who I think could make a real difference to society if she wrote in that vein as well.
B00028HBKM|5.0|If you would like to see the closest depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus's life captured on film, this is it. <br /> <br />This audio/video experience will keep you within 10 feet of Jesus as he was tortured and made to suffer so that we would not have to.  This is the most important event in human history portrayed on film, in the most unapologetic, no holds barred fashion. <br /> <br />You've read or you've heard what he did for us on the cross, but that is nothing compared to seeing it.  No one can truly know the depth of pain and suffering he went through to save us all, even after seeing this film.  The sick thing is we look in horror and some cant even bear to face it because its \\"so horrible\\" but guess what?  That should be us bearing that punishment.  The least we should do is be willing to face it. <br /> <br />This film Mel Gibson has made goes right along side \\"The Ten Commandments\\" in what it means to me and my biblical film library.  It is a fine cut into main stream media that is completely unforgiving in its delivery of truth.  Some cant handle it.  Some can.  Some dont want to handle it... <br /> <br />Funny thing is, I believe even the staunchest Atheist knows there is a God, they just chose to lie to themselves to make life easier for themselves with their decision. <br /> <br />If you believe, and you face this truth, you have to decide what your going to do about it.  If you decide your going to do that you have to decide what changes you have to make.  When you realize what changes you have to make..you have to decide if and how your going to do it...so you turn away or you look forward. <br /> <br />Face the truth.
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|I've been a fan of Marillion since almost the beginning.  I heard Fugazi and have been hooked ever since...although lost some excitment after the crappy Holidays in Eden and then again after Marillion.com. But with Anoraknophia and now Marbles, Marillion keeps surprising me with damn good albums.  Maybe not the \\"prog\\" of their yesteryear but some songs like the moody \\"Ocean Cloud\\" display that they can write proggy stuff if they want to. But that's it, they play and write what they want. This albums shows a mature band of incredibly gifted musicians doing their best.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Once again George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher and the boys are back doing what they all do best. It's just great to see these guys doing great death metal music for so many years. They enjoy pleasing their fans so much, rather than trying to go mainstreem which is a good thing. Now about The Wretched Spawn, this album, from the fast intense opener Severed Head Stoning to They Deserve To Die is just excitingly intense from start to finish. Lead growler Fisher gives out arguably one of his strongest performances on here, he is just fast. Mad monster drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz is arguably one of the best death metal drummers out there, man his lightning fast blastbeats will destroy you, along with Alex Webster's fast finger bass lines. That poser Avril Lavigne should be taking guitar lessons from both Jack Owen and Pat O'Brien, those guys just continue to rip through bodies like an angry buzzing chainsaw. Those guys are a wonderful guitar team. Anyway this album is just as great as other CC albums, and every death metal fan should own this already classic. Hail Cannibal Corpse.
B000244FDW|5.0|Recently my tape version of this finally died. I think I killed it with overuse. I learned that it had recently been transferred to DVD and ordered it. I have had bad experiences with such transfers, but was hoping that it would be at least viewable. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is bright and clear on DVD!  <br /> <br />I came in by way of reading this story before I saw the video versions. Perhaps that explains why I prefer this version -- which has much more of the feel of the novel -- to the quite excellent version from the 1990's. The later version is a bit darker, but also, well, sexier with a touch of beefcake -- at least as much so as you are going to get in a tale of Miss Austen's -- but the light touch, the humor, and the superb casting of this older version still has my heart. If you are a high school student cheating by watching a video rather than reading the book -- shame on you! -- this is the one to watch. You are, by the way, depriving yourself of exposure to one of the finest stylists in English literature. And did you notice the price? This is a bargain!
B00028HBKM|3.0|Even after the passage of half a year, I still vividly remember my arrival at the screening room where I was to review Mel Gibson's controversial new movie The Passion of the Christ. I was stunned to find a vast majority of the audience staring at the blank screen in stony, nervous silence. Many of these individuals had journeyed to the theater on a chilly Wednesday evening in the hopes of viewing a faith-affirming and reverential retelling of Jesus Christ's final 12 hours on Earth (as recorded in the Gospels). Others can come to determine if the film was as gruesomely violent and virulently anti-Semitic as many critics and religious leaders had proclaimed. Every person in the room was waiting doggedly to be either moved and heartened by Gibson's spiritual ecstasy or revolted by the brutality and prejudice of a cinematic travesty. It was clear to me immediately that I was dealing with a movie so provocative and polarizing that it could frighten and compel an audience of people who had not even seen it yet. Now, with the release of the movie on DVD imminent, I feel it is prudent to reflect on this unique and controversial piece of cinema in a calm and rational manner. You are entitled disagree with some of my opinions (I admit to not being a Christian, but I have tremendous respect for all religions and a strong belief in God), but I beg you to hear me out and reserve any final judgments until you have finished this review.               <br /> <br />The film I watched was sometimes as beautiful and moving as the devout among us had hoped, but often as harsh and nasty and the cynics in the audience had feared. This is without a doubt one of the most unrelentingly violent movies ever produced, with enough vicious beatings and flowing blood to make The Silence of the Lambs and Natural Born Killers look like Disney films. In the hands of his Roman tormenters, Jesus is chained to a post and whipped with powerful sticks and a cat-of-nine-tails with hooks until almost every inch of his body is covered in cuts and sours. He is spit on, slapped, punched and pummeled more times than any person could hope to count. When Jesus is nailed to the cross near the film's conclusion, the audience gets to see the dull nails obliterate his flesh and hear his bones cracked by the additional beatings of the Roman soldiers. I deeply respect Gibson's desire to portray the suffering Jesus endured in an honest manner, but after a couple of hours such displays of violence come across sickening and gratuitous. I was so desensitized and disheartened by these violent acts that I was unable to find inspiration in Jesus' bravery and perseverance in the face of danger. The abundance of violence also prevented me from gaining a greater understanding of Jesus' philosophy of tolerance, devotion and brotherhood. There is precious little screen time devoted to Jesus' teachings and sermons, and these sequences (usually presented as flashbacks) are often stilted and unconvincing. Still, I should note that many people that I love and respect have found the violence in this film to be appropriate and moving, so perhaps I would have to become a Christian to truly appreciate and understand it.   <br /> <br />Although the Romans are depicted as Christ's most prominent oppressors, he is also tormented and abused by the prominent rabbi Caiphus and his counsel of high Jewish priests. Since many people are reluctant to see this movie because of the alleged anti-Semitism it contains, I feel I should discuss this issue at length for the benefit of potential DVD buyers. Caiphus is presented as a bloodthirsty and unsympathetic tyrant who demands that Jesus be crucified for having the audacity to claim that he is the Messiah. He turns Jesus over to the Romans without a second thought and later brings an angry throng of Jews before a ridiculously weak-willed Pontius Pilate to loudly demand the death of Jesus. Pilate is deeply conflicted about murdering a man that he can find no series fault with, but he ultimately relents to the will of the high priest and orders Jesus crucified. These cartoonish images of Jewish villainy have led many to dismiss the film as anti-Semitic garbage, and they certainly damage the historical credibility of the movie (however, since Gibson was only concerned about being faithful to the Gospels, which are personal accounts that are not neccessarily as historically consistent or politically correct as some would like, maybe this isn't a fair complaint). However, many historians believe that Caiphus and the other Jewish priests were reluctant to turn Jesus over to the Roman authorities, but did so to prevent Jesus from cultivating a following big enough to bring down the wrath of the hostile Roman Empire on the entire Jewish population. Additionally, Pontius Pilate was, by all accounts, a cruel an inflexible ruler who hardly needed the encouragement or permission of a powerless minority group to execute a troublemaker. <br /> <br />Gibson may have exaggerated the wrongdoings of some Jewish individuals, but he also presents several positive and heroic Jewish figures. The character Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus bear his cross when he is too weak to perform the task himself, and movingly risks his own life to defend Christ from further Roman abuse. Other Jews chastise Caiphus for his intolerance towards Jesus and wail with grief when they see Jesus' mangled body being dragged through the streets by the Romans. Ultimately, I don't think this film can be truly described as Anti-Semitic. It presents a wide range of Jewish characters that act in accordance with their personal beliefs and are not representative of the religious group as a whole. Fear of anti-Semitism is not a valid reason to avoid this movie!  <br /> <br />Thus far, I have primarily focused on the aspects of this film that disturbed me. I must make it clear that The Passion of the Christ is not a film without numerous merits. Gibson is a gifted filmmaker, and many of his visual and dramatic devices are dramatically riveting. I was particularly impressed with the depiction of the devil as a shrouded, voyeuristic woman, the use of a raindrop as the starting point of a stunning earthquake, and a brightly lit resurrection sequence that left much of the audience beaming. The performances are universally superb (particularly the passionate and emotionally vivid turns by Jim Caviezal as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern as the Virgin Mary), and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography perfectly captures the agony and the ecstasy of this momentous tail.  <br /> <br />I almost regret having to give this movie a star grade. The Passion is simply too complex and polarizing to be accessed so easily. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to gain a greater understanding of Christian history or simply put the controversy surrounding this film into perspective. But it is not for the faint of heart!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|An absolute must for anyone with even a passing interest in film or film history.  The restoration of the main feature is brilliant and while some of the original footage has been lost and therefore not able to be included in the programme, the manner in which the remastering has been handled to cover the 'missing' footage is superb - leaving the viewer with a complete picture of the whole movie.  Enough to say the subject matter of Metropolis is as relevant today as when Lang made it.  The 'extras' on the DVD with the history of this movie and the details of how the special effects were made are staggering.  The brief history of German cinematography between 1925 and when Hitler came to power is well worth the value of the whole package.  I would rate this as a 10 out of 10 purchase.<br /><br />Phenella

0316666343|4.0|Lovely bones is lovely. But not as lovely as Lucky (by the same author).
B00005JMUA|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is a taste that I have had some difficulty acquiring over the years. I greatly admire his ability to populate a film with twisted, quirky but strangely compelling characters and fill their mouths with the snappiest, most sardonic dialogue this side of Raymond Chandler. Still, his compulsive desire to portray graphic violence on the screen has sometimes left me overwhelmed and sickened, creative though the carnage may be. Tarantino's love of blood was readily apparent in Kill Bill: Volume 1, a gratuitously brutal homage to Eastern martial arts films that premiered last November. Uma Thurman starred as the Bride, a retired assassin who seeks vengeance when her former colleagues, led by her mentor Bill, murder the assembled guests at her wedding rehearsal and leave her for dead. Thurman did an admirable job of capturing the determination and unbridled rage of an individual obsessed with destroying those who have wronged her, but Tarantino seemed more interested in placing his leading characters into frenetic, over-the top ninja battles than developing their personalities and motivations. Nevertheless, he has redeemed himself with the surprisingly stunning Kill Bill: Volume 2, a film that is as entertaining and moving as any second chapter ever placed on celluloid. <br /> <br />Tarantino has corrected the lack of character analysis that pervaded the first film by fashioning several powerful flashback sequences that finally reveal the histories, priorities and values of many of the characters. In the first portion of the movie we are taken back to the moments before the wedding massacre, when Bill (a brilliant David Carradine) comes to pay a final visit to the woman who abandoned him. There is a sense of wistfulness and nostalgia that pervades the air (captured beautifully by Tarantino's black and white cinematography) as Carradine and the Thurman reminisce about old times and discuss current anxieties. It suddenly becomes apparent that the murders to ensure are not crimes of hatred, but symbols of the heartbreak felt by a sociopath who has lost the only woman he ever cared for. Kill Bill has developed into a unique and touching love story, and the passion Bill and the Bride still feel toward each other adds complexity and shading to their continuing battles.  <br /> <br />In later scenes, we see more enthralling flashbacks of Bill teaching his young protg about how the power of vengeance compelled a high priest to kill an entire order of monks and the Bride pushing herself to the limit as she perfects her martial arts abilities under the imperious instruction of Pei Mei (a great performance from Gordon Lui). These sequences finally give the audience a clear idea of the ideals and memories that compel Thurman to kill, and her mission now has an air of nobility and grandeur. It becomes a pleasure to watch the Bride overcome the tawdry traps and dirty tricks of opponents like the gleefully evil Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and the quietly sadistic Budd (Michael Masden) because it is clear that she has achieved a level of mental and physical maturity that they can't even aspire to. The battle sequence between the Bride and Elle stands out in particular as a wonderfully staged and scripted struggle between two women who represent everything the other loathes.  <br /> <br />The movie climaxes with a brilliant thirty minute confrontation between Bill and the Bride that surpassed the highest expectations of the audience. A description of these final scenes could not do them justice; suffice it to say they include the most perceptive and poignant dialogue Tarantino has written since Pulp Fiction, riveting and nuanced work from Carradine and Thurman, and a dramatically and emotionally satisfying conclusion to the saga. <br />
0312995423|3.0|Like many readers, I picked up \\"Digital Fortress\\" after reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". This was Brown's first novel, and you can certainly appreciate how far along he has come in his art. I found the plot to be enjoyable, if you can overlook some of the technical issues that have been brought up by other reviewers--it is, after all, fiction. But the plot and characters are nowhere as tight as they were in \\"Da Vinci\\", and I found the ending of the novel to be a bit of a letdown. If you ignore the success of \\"Da Vinci\\", however, and just consider this book as part of the technical thriller genre, then it's a decent book but nothing memorable.
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril Lavigne is no acception at all. She's not even punk, rock, or even hardcore. She's just a piece of MTV/pop bulls*** along with Pink, Madonna, Christina Aguilera, Alanis Morissette, Justin Timberlake, Nick Carter,Britney Spears, and any other crappy band I can think of. You want real music, listen to Slayer, Pantera, Rammstein, Kreator, Megadeth, Deicide, Metallica, Cannibal Corpse, Sepultura, Morbid Angel, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, Suffocation, Obituary, Machine Head, King Diamond/Mercyful Fate, and Black Sabbath/Ozzy Osbourne.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|This album is already starting to collect dust in my CD rack. Sure Avril's music isn't what it used to be. That horrible pop garbage. Now she's actually pop/rock. But guess what it still sucks! My friend said that I'd probably like this because I'm a metal fan. So I listened to her and got it. Basically she trying to sound like Amy Lee. She's dressing like her, she's trying to make the music sound like hers, but she fails. Lets rate the songs one by one shall we.  <br /> <br />#1: Take Me Away - This song is alright. She tries to scream in this song but it still sounds like singing. The hard thing is besides the song &#34;Forgotten&#34; this is the only other &#34;heavy&#34; song on here. ::3/5:: <br />#2: Together - This song would've been pretty if Avril would've kept her mouth shut. This kind of sounds like Evanescence's Immortal song. Yes it's one of those graceful songs. Another ok song, Avril could've used another filter though. Because her voice sounds horrid. Especially when she's yelling together at the top of her lungs at the end. Please avoid the end of this song. Oh and by the way I've heard better harmonizing by two cats sitting on a fence meowing than this chick could ever do in her lifetime. ::3/5:: <br />#3: Don't Tell Me - You've all probably heard this on the radio. Again Avril could've used a filter. But this song is ok. This is like a heavy pop song. ::2/5:: <br />#4: He Wasn't - Blah! I wanna puke everytime I hear this song. She's sounds like she was trying to create (somehow) a punk-rock track. But failed to be a utterly disgusting pop song. These lyrics are so simple-minded and stupid that it bleeds. Definitely a no-no!!! ::0/5:: <br />#5: How Does It Feel - I dont know if this was the next track or not but anyways, this song is also utterly disgusting. I don't know if she was trying to create a country/pop song or what. But it's a disgrace. ::0/5:: <br />#6: My Happy Ending - You guys probably hear this song on the radio now too. This song isokay but I dislike the chorus. Her voice sounds like someone scratched their nails across a chalkboard. ::1/5:: <br />#7: Nobody's Home - Many people (who are Avril fans) like this song so if you are, you might like it also. Personally, I dont see the big deal of this song. So even if people are gonna yell at me, I give it -&#62; ::0/5:: <br />#8: Forgotten - I read in previous reviews that someone said this song sounded metal. Obviously that person never heard metal before in their lives. This isn't metal what-so-ever. Personally I think it would've been good if someone else who could sing or at least SCREAM well did it! Avril can't even scream right! This beginning of the song sounds absolutely horrible. The guitar playing is weak. Nothing on this song is right. And it for sure isn't metal. ::0/5:: <br />#9: Who Knows - This song is stupid! The lyrics are dumb. I mean she couldn't come up with a better chorus then: &#34;Who knows what could happen, do what you do, just keep on laughing, one thing's true, there's always a brand new day, and I'm gonna live today like it's my last day.&#34; Thanks for informing us that there's always a brand new day Avril. Stupid much? ::0/5:: <br />#10: Fall to Pieces - Of course again this is another one of her country/pop songs that I dislike. If you're an Avril fan you might like it considering her fans think this song is the best in the world. But you know I don't! So bad rating for Fall to Pieces. ::0/5:: <br />#11: Freak Out - This song is alright. I hate the music in it, it kind of sounds like it'd be Barney's pop/rock mixtape. But it doesn't irk me, so it probably wouldn't irk you. You'd probably like it. ::2/5:: <br />#12: Slipped Away - This is another country/pop song. ::sigh:: But then again if you like Fall to Pieces, How Does It Feel, and Nobody's Home. You'd probably like this one too. ::0/5:: <br /> <br />Ya see, this album is only for Avril fans. But maybe if you hated her last album with burning hatred maybe you MIGHT appreciate this one a tad more. But this is definitely recommended for die-hard Avril fans only.  <br />
B00005LOLD|5.0|Marlon Brando stars in \\"Sayonara,\\" a 1957 love story based on the James Michener novel that tackles the issue of interracial romance.  Brando plays a Major in the Air Force stationed in Korea, who also happens to be the son of a big-shot General and is wooing the daughter (played by Patricia Owens) of a Lt. General.  When one of the men under his command (Red Buttons) declares his intentions of marrying a Japanese woman (Miyoshi Umeki), Brando tries to talk him out of it.  When Brando and Buttons are transferred to Japan, Brando re-ignites his relationship with his girlfriend who is living there with her family.  However, he also starts to realize that he's never explored what he actually wants in life - everything has been dictated by his family and social position.  He then surprises even himself when he is attracted to a mysterious Japanese dancer, played by Miiko Taka.<br /><br />\\"Sayonara\\" is surprisingly effective, both as a romance and as an \\"issues\\" movie; it really stands up better than most \\"issues\\" movies of its time.  Most of the reason is because of the superb acting; Buttons and Umeki won Oscars for their supporting roles.  In addition, Brando gives an under-stated, sensitive performance in his Oscar-nominated role.  Fortunately, the outstanding acting allows the audience to believe Brando's transformation as well as the relationships that form, which is crucial for this film.  Director Joshua Logan also does great work here, especially as he's best known for rather over-heated, unsubtle movies such as \\"Bus Stop\\" and \\"Picnic.\\"  The cinematography is exquisite and the segments in the Japanese theaters are wonderfully staged.  Although \\"Sayonara\\" is a bit on the long side and probably could have used some editing, it's a first-class drama.  Highly recommended.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Now a days hip-hop has become simple, stagnant, and repeatitive.  It was at it's lowest until Kanye dropped this joint.  Everyone who says he is garbage needs to really check themselves, and what they listen too.  This CD is the most recent Hip-Hop classic.  Kanye stays equally hot on his beats, lyrics, and ideas.  Rapping on a range of topics, but it's not the range of the topics that is important but the topics themselves.  He raps about God, College, Life, Family, and working.  But he also adds the normal, gun, girls, and money topics, but those are mostly club joints.  It is a breath of fresh air to see an MC who is honest about how he feels and trys something new rather than doing what everyone else does.  EVERY hip-hop fan should own this disc, it will one day be viewed as the one that changed the game when it was static.  And how can ANYONE say he is lyrical garbage with a line like this...\\"Killin y'all on that lyrical sh*t, Mayonnaise colored Benz I push Miracle Whips\\".....PLEASE!!!  Go buy it now, KANYE SAVED THE GAME!
B000002MUN|5.0|Wildflowers finds Tom Petty at the top of his game.  Having finally achieved the mega-success he always deserved with Full Moon Fever, Petty no longer had anything to prove.  I can't help but identify these songs with a mellow Tom Petty, although mellow probably isn't the best word for a musician who can still rock like few others.  There's definitely a softer quality to this music, however; the frenetic energy of earlier classics such as American Girl and Refugee are great, but Petty's music has matured over the years into something that transcends what has come before.  One cannot help but notice the obvious influence of Petty's Traveling Wilburys band mates in these songs.  Dylan's influence has been there for many years, but the grace and soul of George Harrison's music wends its way through several of these tracks in a most telling way.  Once again, Petty is stepping out without the formal participation of the Heartbreakers, but there's no absence of Mike Campbell to be found in these songs.<br /><br />This 1994 album is packed with 15 quality tracks, totaling almost 63 minutes, showering Petty fans with an abundance of blessings.  I believe You Don't Know How It Feels was the first single, but in my opinion this song pales in comparison to most of the other tracks collected here.  Rocking tracks include You Wreck Me, the almost whimsical but undeniably fun Honey Bee, Cabin Down Below (espousing a driving beat with a slight country feel to it), and House in the Woods (get your Petty twang right here).<br /><br />Time to Move On is, by lyrics and rhythm, a traveling song that hearkens to the ever-present open road to new experiences.  To Find a Friend reminds me of Into the Great Wide Open from the album of the same name, but this song has a softer beat and a more emotional focus on the life-change being described; the chorus is as catchy as it is meaningful.  Don't Fade On Me relies on minimalist guitar accompaniment to produce a song with many of the hallmarks of folk music, one with periodic touches of bluegrass-tinged twang.  A Higher Place has the most foot-stomping energy of any song on the album, making it a song you will want to listen to over and over.<br /><br />Some quite impressive tracks, such as the title track, feature a laid-back, soft style that contrasts significantly with earlier incarnations of Petty.  It's Only a Broken Heart is a beautiful slow song that has Petty singing in a noticeably high register, one that does not allow for any of the nasal sounds Petty is known for.  I've never heard another Petty song which compares to this one.  Hard On Me is another slow, moving song with great lyrics and a wonderful sense of freely open vulnerability on Petty's part.  Wake Up Time closes the album out in fine fashion.  The piano plays a large part in this meaningful song about getting on with life after you realize your dreams are not going to come true.  This song serves, to my mind, as a musical counterpoint to the maturity with which Petty has embraced his music and career at this point in his life.<br /><br />I've saved the best for last, as two tracks on this album stand among the best of Petty's career.  It's Good to be King is just a stellar track that describes life as it would be in a perfect world.  Crawling Back to You is a song I love more each time I hear it; I think the lyrics to this song could have been better, yet it's one of those songs that have found a permanent slot in the CD player of my mind.  Overall, despite a few weak lines scattered here and there, I can't help but believe that Wildflowers is Tom Petty's most impressive album by far.e hallmarks of folk music, one with periodic touches of bluegrass-tinged twang.

B000002UA2|5.0|An incredible album! This is one of Pink Floyd's hidden gems, including such albums as Atom Heart Mother and Meddle. After being somewhat disappointed with the soundtrack to \\"More\\", I was hesistant to pick this up, but it is AMAZING. Listening to the album, you can immediately recognize the roots and beginnings to there later hit albums \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\". Tracks like Gilmour's \\"Childhood's End\\", constantly remind me of their later sounds. The slow build up, expanding into incredible guitar rhythms, some organ, and the patented Floyd (Gilmour) funk beat.  <br />Gilmour does some incredible guitar solos in \\"the gold it's in the...\\", Wright's \\"Stay\\" is a beautiful and incredibly chill love song, and Waters does his stuff in \\"free four\\" and \\"wot's...uh the deal\\".  <br />If you liked Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, then buy this CD. My only criticism was that the tracks should have gone on longer (most are 4-5 minutes, instead of their 10-15 minute classics). Enjoy!
B00003CXI1|1.0|Alright... this is not a nice review and I am not going to act like it is going to be.  You want the truth about this movie, the pure undiluted truth.  This movie is absolute crap (pardon the language).  I am an avid fan of the books, and I have been reading them since my mom bought the first book and started to read it to me when I was about eleven, I liked the book so much that she never saw it again after the first chapter.  I am almost seventeen (so that equals to about six years of love for this imaginary world.)  The books are wonderful, this movie... should be thrown away and not a single sequel should have come of it.  They should have stopped, waited for all of the books to be written, and then started back up again with the first.  This movie hardly shows what a wonderful series that this first book started, but rather is shows a horrible first movie that only got worse.  Characters are misrepresented, the story line is wrong, ending is botched... need I continue.  I went to see this movie in theatre when it was released, and I was fairly excited to see how they would make this magic real, but by the end I really wanted to shoot the director.  (I actually left the theatre and sat outside in the car... I never saw the whole movie until my dad rented the movie.)  So it is my advice to you, do not watch the movies, but rather sit down with the book and let your imagination create the world, that Hollywood failed to create.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Yet another incredible musical journey by one of the most profoundly interesting and satisfying progressive artists of all time.  Yes, there are a couple of songs that miss the mark, but overall, after some listening, it gets more and more amazing in the scope of content and sound.  I've been a fan practically forever and I can't think of any other artist that can morph into different musical expression the way Alan does.  Of course I miss the old band, but Alan constantly satisfies with each record and I really hope this one does very well.  The quality of the sound alone will make any audiophile shiver with excitement.
B00008DDXC|2.0|I am sixteen years old and I began reading the books at the age of about eleven-ish.  I am a great fan of J.K. Rowling's work, I mean it is amazing... but these movies are horrid.  They do not follow the story line.  Let me re-phrase that... they vaugely follow the true story line.  Columbus should not have been the man to have directed this and Rowling should have been more involved.  It is my belief that Columbus has not even read the books, or at least not the first two.  He completely botched the ending of both books and he did not choose very good actors... Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Rupert Grint and Daniel Ratcliff (apart from having is ever-so-famous-trademark green eyes.  Come on, color contact are not hard to acquire) I think were casted wonderfully, they are good representations of their characters, but the others are shamefull.  I rejoiced when I heard that Columbus is not longer directing.  I think that they should have waited until the series has been written and completed, because then they would be able to determine character better.  But they first two movies almost destroyed my love for the books, but thankfully I re-read them.  So for now I refuse to see anymore of these horrid movies.  I think that these movies are going to be begging to be remade in the not so distant future... or am I just dreaming?
B00028HBKM|5.0|So far we don't remember where we've been.  This film is a plausible \\"realistic\\", masterfully-crafted attempt at showing what this historical figure, Jesus, went through -- for better or worse.  You may not be willing (open minded enough?) to be able to accept that Jesus was actually divine, and if so, this movie will indeed just be a meaningless gorefest to you.  But facts are facts.  The things we take for granted, such as the essential dignity of the human person, that just so happen to make trivial innovations such as democracy a plausible form of government, are Christian in origin.  Eleven of twelve apostles, who witnessed THE Passion firsthand, wouldn't willingly undergo martyrdom just to pull off a hoax for a lunatic or an egomaniac.<br /><br />Nor is it to be close-minded or ignorant to be Christian (as the modern press might have you believe) -- moreso the other way around. Read, read, read.  Augustine's Confessions from 400 A.D., Ignatius of Antioch from 100 A.D., Chesterton's Everlasting Man or C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity from the 20th Century.  Our flawed understanding of science has changed radically from the 19th century to today-- whereas Christian writings from the 2nd century are clearly recognizable in the Catholic Church's present teachings.  Go figure.<br /><br />You may be surprised (if you can get past the modern day \\"enlightened\\" blinders) where what we take for granted actually comes from.  Use this cinematic masterpiece for what it is -- the most realistic depiction to date of THE historical event that literally changed mankind for the better (regardless of whatever selfish scoundrels have done in whoever's name throughout history), not for what you'd like it to be.  Gibson just had a new interview on EWTN's \\"The World Over\\" just yesterday.  Kudos to Mel for his continued gutsiness and honesty.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Highway 61 Revisited effortlessly earns its reputation as one of the greatest albums ever created.  What is most amazing to me about Dylan is how his best-known songs fail to do him justice, and how his albums are so much better than his singles.  The most famous piece from this album, Like A Rolling Stone, is deftly-constructed indeed...but there are at least two songs on this album I would rank above it, and several more that are its equal.  This album is just that good. <br /> <br />Lyrically and compositionally almost every song is a joy.  From the bouncy strums of the opening to Like A Rolling Stone, to \\"dun-dun-dun...twang\\" of the hook in Queen Jane Approximately, to the driving guitar of Desolation Row, Dylan constantly delights the ear.  His lyrics, of course, are a draw, and no review of this album would be complete without touching upon their excellence.  Dylan has (had?) a knack for capturing emotions in a visual, visceral sense, whether describing desperation (Ballad of a Thin Man), whimsy (Highway 61 Revisited) or simply putting a spin on your standard love song (Queen Jane). <br /> <br />This brings me to the final outstanding characteristic of Highway 61...the variety of tone.  Dylan leaps from theme to theme with such ease and complete mastery of each that this alone practically confirms his status as a modern genius.  When you factor in the influence and novelty of this album, you'd have a tough time finding better candidates for the greatest album ever made.  True, it is not perfect...there are maybe two tunes that can be skipped (Tombstone Blues comes to mind)...but it comes as close as anything else out there.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The continuation of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 begins with a quick recap that clarifies the Bride's (Uma Thurman) vengeful journey.  The Bride was mercilessly executed by her former boss Bill (David Carradine) and his associates at her wedding rehearsal as she tried to escape her violent past as a hired killer.  However, she survived and is now seeking those who drew the first blood.  This leads the story into several flashbacks where the Bride recollects her past which explains all parties reasons for violence.  These flashbacks fragments the storyline, yet each memory fills a void in the story as the characters are illustriously described on the silver screen.<br /><br />Tarantino maintains the visually brilliant experience that he initiated in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 where he uses cinematic nostalgia from different film genres.  The camerawork is flawless as it enhances the moment of each scene in an artistic as well as suitable manner.  In addition, Tarantino digs deeper into human values and morals as they conflict with character's backgrounds and traditions as the Bride seeks her vengeance.  The only thing that Tarantino does not improve is his score selection as it was superior in Kill Bill: Vol. 1.  Nonetheless, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 offers a violently alluring cinematic experience that has deep intrigues and much to ponder for a wide range of viewers.
B000056H25|2.0|The end of the film has modern commentary that the director wanted to make a film of Jesus without commentary or additions but that's exactly what he did. For example, with the \\"adulterous woman,\\" Jesus never said \\"You've judged her correctly; she has sinned.\\" He only writes on the ground and says whomever has not sinned to stone her first. Is this significant? Could be. Remember that they only brought the woman, where was the man with whom she was allegedly caught? God's Law requires that TWO witnesses be presented and that BOTH adulterers be stoned. Were there two witnesses? Where was the man? Something to think about.<br /><br />Those kinds of \\"little things\\" happened througout the movie and bothered me as a believer. Why not just stick to the original text?!  The modern film The Gospel of John, I'd recommend instead.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) is a 60-year-old businessman that likes to keep his women young as he is about to spend the weekend with Marin (Amanda Peet) at her parents family beach house.  The trip to the beach house leads Harry into a new phase of his life as he has a close encounter with death as he has a heart attack.  This phase opens doors to a new world for Harry as he discovers what he has been missing in his life, yet he is an old dog that has a hard time conforming to his new ideals.  Something's Gotta Give is an amusing film with serious undertones of love, trust, and age that is well-balanced by Meyers.

His voice is extremely harmful to the ear drums!  I just couldn't take much of some of the songs, because of his voice...I have to hand it to them (Mark Tremonti etc) for trying at least, but dudes, get a new lead singer, this one really sucks!!!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|One of the few movies that you will want to watch over and over again. The ending seemed to imply that there will be a sequel so I'm crossing my fingers for Underworld 2.
B00007L4OM|4.0|Good entertainment, if you want a movie with a happy ending and a lot of dead bad guys.Since the French public prefers American movies to their own, the French now make American style movies.Fun to watch, no more......Jean Reno is great.....
B000077VT7|5.0|haha this movie was awesome.i thought it would be a dull movie but no, i enjoyed it so much that i watched it twice!! i love Franka Potente in this movie. Anyone that likes action/adventure should watch this.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I don't understand why the critics gave this movie such a bad rap. Perhaps thats because they are a bunch of fat armchair warriors looking for \\"Bridges over Madison Country II\\". <br /> <br />Anyway, the movie is very well thought out, and anyone that has read up on 'chaos theory' will appreciate the title and the story. <br /> <br />Next time you say \\"I wish I could have done things differently\\", you will now think twice.
0064471837|5.0|My daughter turned me on to these books and I have consequentially read all three of the series.  The books have exactly what I love - strong female roles, cats, fantasy/magical settings.  I would love to see these come out as a triology a la<br /><br />the Lord of the Rings, done well.  Along with the Golden Compass trilogy these are my favorites and definately will be read over and over and over.
6305718954|4.0|This movie had a message that was so appealing to me it colored my perception of the film with favorable colors in spite of its \\"horror movie\\" parts. Maybe I am wrong, but I felt the movie wanted to say that \\"god is everywhere\\" and that human beings do not need someone to stand between them and god. My feelings about religion were always such that religion is supposed to bring happiness, comfort and support and not engage in war, conflicts and guilt or the acquisition of power.  <br />Another reason for liking this movie was Patricia Arquett. She is so sweet, candid and fresh that her \\"purity\\" seems to come out of the screen. You do believe she was somehow \\"chosen\\" even if the necklace reached her hands by coincidence. <br />As for my criticism. This movie can be described as an horror/thriller. Frankie Page, a hairdresser is starting to hallucinate and have outbursts of acute pains, causing severe wounds in her body. These turn out to be very typical of a situation called Stigmata where strong believers in Christianity totally identify with the suffering of Jesus Christ.  <br />An investigator, sent by the church to check on this case, is drawn to Frankie and keeps on inquiring her case in spite of the fact that she is no believer, a basic criteria for stigmata. As typical to thrillers, our investigator is alone without any help from outside sources. As usual the whole (Christian) world is against him. As usual our investigator arrives in the last moment to save the day. However, the movie, and especially its last part is filled with \\"horror\\"/unnatural parts which were much too much for my taste. I liked the first part of the movie when we did not know yet what is true and what isn't and I was waiting for a logical explanation for everything we saw. I like to be on the thin line between reality and the unnatural, but this film moves towards the unreal in a very firm way. I could accept some \\"miracles\\", especially since the movie explains in such a beautiful way howpeople \\"need\\" the miracles and how such signs of god become the cornerstone of their belief, yet it was a little too much  <br />I would like to add that the movie succeeded in presenting Jesus suffering in a way that makes him, so I felt, closer to any human being (this coming from a Jew) in the sense that one cannot remain indifferent to his suffering after \\"feeling\\" them together with Frankie.  I therefore felt that in spite of the presentation of the \\"church\\" in dark colors, the movie did not do any harm to the Christian faith.  <br />
B0002DB52M|4.0|The opening shot of \\"Dogville\\" is enough to make an immediate connection between Lars von Trier's 2003 film and the classic Thornton Wilder play \\"Our Town.\\"  While narrator John Hurt intorduces us to the place and the people we look at an overhead view of the \\"town\\" of Dogville.  On a large sound stage we can see the few houses, shacks we are told, of Dogville, all outlined in chalk and labeled for our benefit.  There are a few pieces of furniture, a desk or a bed, but everything else is gone.  The focus here is to be on the characters and the story.<br /><br />Clearly von Trier intends to be provocative and his unsettling film is certainly going to get audiences thinking, although exactly what they are going to end up thinking is going to be as much up to the individual as it is to what von Trier has put together.  Then throw into the mix that at 177 minutes long the patience of viewers might be sorely tested before we get to the payoff, but the payoff is such that you should stick around to the end before you make up your mind about \\"Dogville.\\"  The story is told in scenes, so you have clear opportunities to take breaks and get some air, which you are probably going to need at some point in the proceedings.<br /><br />The town of Dogville is in the Rocky Mountains during the Great Depression.  One day a young woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in Dogville, fleeing from gangsters.  Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), a young man who considers himself to be a philosopher, hides her and persuades his neighbors to give her a chance.  For a two-week period she will have a trial run and then they will decide what to do with her and whether they will allow her to stay in their little town.  Tom persuades Grace, who has never done physical labor, to offer to do such work for each person in town, but the citizens of Dogville are, if anything, insulted by the idea that they are not doing what needs be done.  So instead of doing what needs to be done Grace offers to do more trivial things that people would like to have done.<br /><br />For a while Grace appears to be fitting in and she proves her worth to the lady who runs the general store (Lauren Bacall), the guy who grows apples (Stellan Skarsgard) and his wife (Patricia Clarkson), the blind man (Ben Gazzara), Tom's dad the retired doctor (Philip Baker Hall), and the rest.  But then everything changes.  The gangsters trying to find Grace have the cops putting up wanting posters saying she committed a string of bank robberies.  The people of Dogville know this is not true, since she was with them during that time, but this new fact changes their relationship with Grace.  Now, instead of seeing her as someone who is helping them, they see her as being helpless, and they take full advantage of it as they find a multitude of ways to abuse Grace.<br /><br />The biggest clues with regards to the allegorical elements of the film come from Tom Edison's philosophical pronouncements.  He is always trying to persuade the townspeople and/or Grace to his way of thinking and always trying to find illustrations and object lessons to make his point.  The fact that things get progressively worse for Grace is lost on Tom, and they really do get worse for Grace, whose knowledge of the philosophy of stoicism does not serve her as well as you would have thought.  Everything in \\"Dogville\\" has a deeper meaning and even if you do not want to diver into the allegory you can still appreciate the twisted weirdness of it all as Grace endures what Dogville has to offer and Tom sacrifices his supposed idealism to much more baser interests.  You know that in the end the gangsters will come for Grace, so the question is whether or not that will be a good thing or not for both her and the people of Dogville.  Obviously our sympathies are with Grace, but that does not mean anything in the ugly little corner of the world van Trier has created.<br /><br />During the end credits, as David Bowie's \\"Young Americans\\" play over photographs from Jacob Holdt's book \\"American Pictures,\\" van Trier makes it clear that he is pointing the finger at the United States (and it is also clear which finger her is pointing).  I do not know if I have ever seen end credits that have undercut the effectiveness of a film as much as what we have here.  I understood that van Trier was attacking America and the end credits serve as adding injury to insult because to me it basically says \\"You people are probably too stupid to know that I am attacking you, so let me twist the knife until you get the point.\\"  I am willing to sit through a condemnation of American culture and international policy, but van Trier does not have to be so patronizing about it.  I certainly do not remember Bertolt Brecht being patronizing, although I appreciate it is strange to wait until the end credits to criticize van Trier for being nasty in his attack.<br /><br />\\"Dogville\\" is the first in von Trier's third trilogy series entitled \\"USA: Land of Opportunities.\\"  The next film, to be released in 2005, is \\"Mandalay\\" (2005), a story of slavery, also set in the 1930s but this time in the American South.

B00000K19E|5.0|<br /> <br />Morpheus Quotes: \\"What is real, how do define real.\\" When you see the sequel, you'll realize what he means. Every action scene gets you thinking more about what Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) said to Neo (Keanu Reeves) than you thinking about the action. But who is Neo, How was he born, who was his so-called parents, in fact sense \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" explained that their all programs, what was the purpose of creating this powerful program called Neo. <br /> <br />THE TRILOGY <br /> <br />What was the point of making the sequels in the first place if you'r just going to have mindless action, bad acting, and terrible dialogue. Well lets think, if it wasn't for that scene with the architect, the saga would be truly ruined. The architect explains that their entire excistense is to be rewind in time. Every time Neo saves Zion, the machines recreate the entire story. The birth of Neo, the fight between Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), and the love between Trinity Carrie Ann-Moss and Neo. But what they didn't count on was the rogue program, called agent Smith. \\"Reloaded\\" is good cause we get new ideas that \\"The Matrix\\" didn't give us, and that is why I would of given this film 3 out of 4 stars. But when I saw the third installment, I said to myself, \\"WHAT HAPPENED.\\" It was like the Wachowski's (Bound) just gave up on the whole franchise. They may have gotten sick of the whole saga itself. I can't even tell you the ending cause then you wouldn't want to. <br /> <br />

B00005JKC3|4.0|\\"One of The Best Superhero films ever\\" <br /> <br />Bruce Banner(Eric Banner, Troy) is one of the best actors in the business, he shows not only anger in \\"The Hulk\\", but sadness and kindness. Thats what I want to see, I was getting tired of mindless action in \\"Matrix Reloaded\\", so I saw this film and I get character development and actual acting. Nick Nolte trancended acting in the 70's and he's not at his best in this film, but he was good enough for me to dislike his character in this film. Jennifer Connelly who won an academy award for playing the same exact role in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", and she's not all that great in this film, in fact she's down right annoying, but we need that kind of vulnerability in this kind of movie.  <br /> <br />This film doesn't need dialogue like \\"Spider-Man\\", or \\"Superman\\", or even \\"Batman\\", it puts us in a mood that is a little depressing, and silent, like when Bruce describes what he feels when he becomes the Hulk, there's a moment of silence and no music, just the sound of his voice. \\"Boom, Boom\\", Thats what he says when he describes what he feels. Ang Lee is way ahead of his time, when Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" came out, people described the action and the fighting instead of the actual story, cause it's to painful to describe. One of the main, characters die in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", and Bruce Banners spirit dies, but Ang Lee keeps that depressing mood in his films, and shows the Hulk in a different way. He actualy shows him the right way, a person, not none of this Hulk smash stuff, just a person, like me and you, and other people full of anger and a bad past. <br /> <br />

B00005JKCH|4.0|<br /> After viewing \\"Spider-Man 2\\", I'd discovered that it was POINTLESS to create the first Spider-Man film. This film has many powerful scenes, the death of Uncle Ben, Spider-Man defeating The Green Goblin, and the final scen when Peter Parker tells Mary Jane that he can't be with her. <br /> <br />THE WEEKEND THAT MADE HISTORY <br /> <br />In the summer of 2002 I watched every trailer of \\"Spider-Man\\". It was a great summer, women, going to high school, but I was afraid that \\"Spider-Man\\" would tank, and people would hate it and it would be the most controversial film ever, why was Sam Raimi directing this film, why was Tobey Maguire playing \\"Spider-Man\\". This didn't make any sense, Tobey Maguire is a dramatic actor, not an action hero. My cousin and I were thinking this film is going to suck, why didn't James Cameron take a chance to make this film, besides he wanted to write and direct \\"Spider-Man\\" ten years ago. Oh I forgot, he hasn't directed a film in 8 or 7 years, and it still seems that James is still in love with himself, I mean he's acheived everything that he ever wanted to acheive in cinema. <br /> <br />Steven Spielberg, now there's a great director, \\"The Color Purple\\", \\"Shindler's list\\", what a director, HE'S ACHEIVED EVERYTHING, and changed cinema forever. But there's A.I., that film wasn't a dissapointment, but who can trust Spielberg now, he may kill Spider-Man by probably the third film, who knows. Martin Scorsese, well he would probably put gangster's in \\"Spider-Man\\" and that wouldn't be pretty. My cousin and I were contemplating until we had no choice but to wait and see for ourselves. <br /> <br />114 million dollars <br /> <br />I took my mom to Regal Cinemas, and it was a great day, it reminded me of the day I saw \\"Jurrasic Park\\", and \\"Titanic\\", that peaceful silence, I couldn't even speak, I was so nervouse that this film would suck. In fact I was begging it to suck, I expected Maguire and Raimi to fail. My mom and I got there three hours before the movie started, the longer we stood there, the more the line got longer and longer, and longer. I saw people that were my age and baby-boomers that had waited for \\"Spider-Man\\" to come to the big screen. I walked in the movie and I was suprised, I was actually happy to see a film, I hadn't felt that way in years. I sat in my seat, the lights got dimed and the film began. <br /> <br />After about 2 hours, I realized this was an incredible film, I said that at the time, but after seeing the sequal, \\"Spider-Man\\" was just an action film, there was no plot, I already knew the story. \\"Spider-Man 2\\" was a crowning acheivement, it will set the new generation of superhero films, and now I'm looking forward to \\"Batman Begins\\" cause I want to know more about Batman than any other superhero. \\"Spider-Man\\" made 114 million dollars in three days and it grossed 403 million dollars in its total run. I think the \\"Spider-Man\\" saga will probably end up like \\"Harry Potter\\", the darker the saga gets, the less money the saga makes. Roger Ebert's view of this film was false, this was just the tip of the ice berg, it was setting you up for the epic fights in the sequel and the dramatic scenes that have even surpassed \\"Superman\\", and will change cinema forever.  <br /> <br />PS: I was wrong about Tobey Maguire, he's gonna be the best Spider-Man until he reaches age 50. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|Passion of the Christ is a movie without doubt superb! <br /> <br />As an agnostic (raised Catholic), I see the story told on screen for what it is - a dynamic story of a man in emotional turmoil and physical distress. The acting is superb, the writing is superb, the storyline is superb, the directing is superb. The movie as a story is superb, regardless of the subtitles. <br /> <br />Christian believer or Jewish scholar, the storyline portrays the last hours of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, which foretells the basis of Christian belief: Christ dying on the Cross for the sins of Man and being resurected. <br /> <br />Contrary to the Bolshevik nay-sayers of Hollywood, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is NOT anti-semitic any more than it is anti-Roman (Italian). It is an extremely well told story from the New Testement, given the facts as we know them. There were only two major portrayals in the movie, Jews and Romans. What is shown is not one side against another, but rather the issues of the complex socio-political-economic times. Christ and his disiples were, after all, Jews in a Jewish environment, ruled by Romans. <br /> <br />Don't see this movie as an affirmation of faith, or as a racist, anti-Jewish story, but as a historical story of a time and place where bad things happened. If anyone comes away with a different, possibly more positive, point of view, so much the better. <br /> <br />Whatever the view, this should not detract from the Judeo-Christian Canon of the Old and New Testament Bible.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|<br /> <br />The problem with \\"The Matrix\\" is that it only told the story but didn't embrace and explain it as the second movie has done, it told me about Zion but didn't explain the origins of Zion. I didn't get what I wanted to help me makes sense of this world in the first one, but in the \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" I am shown Zion's population, more information about the birth of the matrix and I witness Neo's (Keanu Reeves) complete powers. <br /> <br />*Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age. <br /> <br />\\"The Matrix\\", written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, inspired so much philosophy and so many action films that it's all \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" can do to stay ahead of its followers. *This film is a skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: Heroes, villains, special effects and stunts, chases, explosions and romance. <br /> <br />****SPOILERS AHEAD**** <br /> <br />THE PLOT <br /> <br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo must decide how he can save Trinity (Carrie Ann-Moss) from a dark fate in his dreams. <br /> <br />Three great scenes in `The Matrix Reloaded' surpass \\"The Matrix.\\" The first is when Neo is fighting one hundred Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving) This scene is the most beautiful fight scene, I have ever seen in my life. Unlike most fight scenes, this one makes sense. Agent Smith tells Neo when he destroyed him, his body parts were scattered and became the Matrix. So now he can move in and out of any program in the Matrix. <br /> <br />The second comes when Morpheus returns to Zion and addresses an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in \\"Metropolis.\\" After his speech, the citizens dance to a wonderful soundtrack, which is shown with scenesof Neo and Trinity making love. Maybe those are there real bodies having sex, although I'm not sure. <br /> <br />*The third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with beautiful choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. This scene is a 14 minute fun ride, although I might wonder, if such deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it? <br /> <br />I recognize two philosophies in this movie. First, I feel that this is what might happen to humankind if they let technology develop unchecked. The second philosophy is that love and hope will conquer all. <br /> <br />The film ends with a \\"To Be Concluded\\" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in November. I loved this film and I recommend it to anyone. I give this film a 15 out of 10. <br /> <br />* NOTE: two of These sentences are from Roger Ebert's review of Matrix Reloaded. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00013F38K|5.0|This is an excellent series with many lessons for everyone.
B000000OSG|4.0|If you read my review for \\"Appetite,\\" I think it's fairly obvious how huge a fan I am of GnR. This album, easily triumphing over Use Your Illusion 1, is vastly underrated. For one thing, it appears to me that several of my favorite songs are commonly called mediocre or flat out bad. In my opinion, almost every song is superb, beautifully written, and simply enjoyable. The song opens with a succesion of three beautiful songs, \\"Civil War,\\" peaceful but fueled by apparent emotion; \\"14 Years,\\" a song that despite what's been said, I find irrestibly likeable; and \\"Yesterdays,\\" within my top ten favorite by the band. \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\\" although good, is overrated. \\"Get in the Ring\\" and \\"Shotgun Blues\\" are both mediocre. Listenable, but nothing special by any means. \\"Breakdown\\" is wonderful, \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" is boring, but fine, and \\"Locomitive\\" is an excellent ride. There's really nothing special about \\"So Fine,\\" but I personally love it. \\"Estranged\\" is nothing shy of spectacular. This is one of the few songs where every single aspect of the song is flawless. Arguably Axl's greatest writing, since it's the only song that moved me nearly to tears, and Slash is brilliant on the old axe here. \\"You Could Be Mine\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\" are both very good, and \\"My World\\" is one of the most utterly horrible songs I've ever heard. Undoubtedly GnR's worst. Without this one, Use Your Illusion 2 would stand about as tall as their debut. <br />Oh, the little things. Dizzy on piano is a good touch, in addition to more low-key tunes than Illusion 1 had. However, slow songs aren't good on their own. The brilliant use of this little thing called a climax, powerful emotion that is still able to maintain the title of a \\"ballad,\\" and some of the best pieces lyrically are the things that make this album so good. If only somebody would've cut that ridiculously appalling final track...
B00008H2LB|4.0|Ok I was a bit skepical to check out this album because i wasn't really fond of the first single somwhere i belong.But after reading a alot of reviews i decided to check out meteora myself.My first opinion was that it was awesome but not as good as hybrid. But after listening to it through and through nemourous times i realized that it wasnt as bad as I thought it would be.My favourite tracks are dont stay,Lying from you,hit the floor from the inside and numb, <br /> <br />I recomend meteora to any linkin park fan
B000286S8S|3.0|Okay I am going to lay the cards fairly square on the table I don't see the Roth era band and the recently re patched Hagar era as one and the same band in any form or fashion. I wish they had different names. How can they be described as the same? From the punky vocals and sheer teenage rebellion of the Roth era with the jaw dropping goose bump producing guitar work compared to the tired non emotive Hagar synth overwashed drudgery since 5150. All this collection makes me think to do is to go out and buy everyting from 1984 back. Avoid and wait for the real gang buster tour that everyone deserves and a new album featuring the better line up. Alternatively you could buy this collection like I did and keep pressing the next button whilst driving the car hoping you hit the \\"better\\" songs.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album has lots of great, insightful and articulate reviews, but I had to offer my two cents anyway.  <br />The editorial review called 'OK Computer' \\"difficult\\", but I just don't hear it. This is, in my opinion, probably the best album the band's made yet (and they've made some very good ones). I hate using the term \\"inaccessible\\", but maybe that's what the editorial meant to say. Whatever the case, this album is less \\"inaccessible\\" to people who appreciate a great lyricist. I've read many reviews talking about its sound, its production, its guitar work and its vocals, but I haven't read one review which talks about the lyrics. The lyrics of these songs are ultimately what makes them. For example, you won't understand the irony of the simple melodic prettiness of \\"No Surprises\\" until you listen to the lyrics, the first line of which is \\"A heart that's full up like a landfill/A job that slowly kills you/Bruises that won't heal\\". If you don't take the time to understand what exactly the band is trying say, how the music and the lyrics work together (or against each other) to send the listener a message, if you don't care what kind of statement the record tries to make, then yes, you will probably think this record is stupid and boring and doesn't \\"rock out\\". <br />If by \\"inaccessible\\" you mean \\"can't to listen to ALL parts of the record\\", maybe you're better off with muzak. That way, those stupid lyrics aren't in the way.
B000089CJI|5.0|This CD is full of the warm electronic glow that makes all Bjork Albums classic, makes every note on a later EBTG CD addicting.  There is style and substance here.  You can fall asleep to the songs and you can wake up with them too.  They're upbeat and will keep you from turning completely Emo.  There is never a dull moment as you go on a roller coaster of emotions.  From unrequited love, to death.  The fact that the disc contains such bright and beautiful moments means a lot to a person who sees beauty in the most commercial music.  This is a CD not to be slept on!
B000099T2L|1.0|I haven't been impress by Beyonce writing or singing abilities she has a decent voice she just master her vocals over the years is she the best singer no but okay.  Now this album for one it is not not much of a Solo Album not the kind solo albums I am used to hearing from various female artist.  But it is solo compare to her  minus the other Destiny Child members.  Maybe Crazy in Love is probably some good material which the arrangements are borrowed from a more talented artist/group.  If you wanting to hear some exceptional music from very talented female artist check out Alica Keys, Monica, Norah Jones, Christina A., Jill Scott, Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Jessica Simpson, Toni Braxton, Faith, Kelis, Faith Hill,Lil Mo,  Leah Rimes newcomers to watch out for JoJo, Ciara   and Lea.    Those ladies have exceptional voices or musical instrumental abilities. I enjoy all kinds of music so the ladies mention above are very gifted voices, writing and musicians.      I wish Beyonce the very best in spite of my rating of her album.  Could she have done better yes, but she was on the Billboard chart for several weeks for some of this albums songs which means that is not be ignore but realize the music business is all about politics and promotion from the record companies even if you are talented artist with all the abilities to sing, write and produce your album could be shelved for less talented individuals and if people hear the same song over, over again through promotion or radio play people tend to listen to that. Something to keep in mind.   If you get a chance I really encourage anyone viewing this review please take a opportunity  check out the albums of the ladies I mention in this review I think you will be plesantly surprise.  Peace!
B000008GHW|5.0|This is an endeavor where Jimi used the electronics of his Electric Ladyland studio to his best advantage.  It is his rock work with some humour and upbeat offerings.  Instead of being his normal otherworldly self, cuts like \\"My Friend\\" and \\"Belly Button Window\\" show Hendrix as he really was.  A class A musician (perhaps the best rock guitar player of all time) and a person who could see both the seriousness of the failings of our time and the humour in that seriousness.  \\"In From The Storm\\" has to be listened to several times to hear the elegance of the studio effect.  Plus Emaretta Marks (of the original Hair musical cast) adds soaring vocals. I recommend it to any TRUE Hendrix fan.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Amazing. Beautifully directed and a great cast.  The love of God poured out from this movie... It reminded me of His Love, the Love that I so often push aside.   This movie really brought the scriptures home for me, and I'm thankful for that.  Wonderful movie, highly recommended for all.
B000002UAX|4.0|This could have been a great 5-star single album by cutting out the weaker tracks.  Lots of fans are glad to have all 30 tracks though, even if this means pressing skip a lot, perhaps on Rev.#9 and Monkey.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|The last AP title I bought was 'Try Anything Once', I wasn't really thrilled with that one, a few good tracks but overall fair at best. <br />This new release is hit and miss: The best tracks are tracks 1, 3, 4, 7. Some of the tracks don't seem to fit: 2, 5, 6. There seems to be a attempt at 'club music' here and there based on the special guests. I would have to agree with another reviewer that there is 'Not Enough Gilmour', if there was it may have improved things. The remakes you'll either love them or say 'the original version was better' like I did. No killer cd here, just an interesting release. Sound quality however is standard Alan Parsons reference quality with some of the deepest bass I've heard thus far: tracks 1 and 7 highlight this perfectly. I would rate sound quality a 10, huge soundstage and a 3d sound throughout. If you plan to crank this cd make certain your system can handle it! 9 tracks/49.21. Strange that AP didn't use more of the available cd capacity, he could have fit at least 20m more on this disc. Full booklet/credits/lyrics.
076790592X|5.0|Morrie was a wonderful man whose spirit lives on in this great book about his passage from life to death.  A beautiful read.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I can't believe americans would pay to see some american complain and make fun about his own country.  It's like if I were to make a movie about how little I get paid and then get rich off of it.  I think if someone would like to see this movie it should be a bootleg version.
B0000028M7|5.0|Ok I might have nothing new to say that wasn't said before. You heard it all, the best album from one of the best bands of all time, perfection, masterpiece, briliance, ..., ..., what do you need more. Still not convinced? here's what are you going to do: open your kazaa (imesh, winmx, dc++, whatever) and download Down In A Hole, and listen to it. Now if you don't feel the need to listen to it again and again and again,..., and you don't think that thats one of the best songs ever, then theres no hope for you. But that's not going to happen. You'r gonna buy this CD immediatley, and once you do that, you'r gonna find out why does this album have 5 star average review here. <br />I'm not gonna say anything abut any song in particular, or any other detail, because it's been done before by other reviewers, and I don't think I can do it better. <br /> <br />And if you are still not convinced, there's still one thing to do - read the one star reviews. You'r gonna \\"find out\\" that Alice In Chains are nothing more than godsmack rip offs, puddle of mudd wannabies, and that limp bizkit is the best band in the hisory of mankind. Just another reason to buy this CD asap
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is an example of what was good with television.  Sadly for fans of the series it was on Fox and if it doesn't appeal to all the 18 to 24 year old males then it ain't worth it to Fox.  Enjoy this set and wait for the movie next year.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie won't be for others. You may like it better or worse after seeing Volume 2. Basically, it involves The Bride wanting to exact revenge on those who ruined her life earlier. It has good acting, great music, and great direction by the talented Quentin Tarantino. Definitely recommended!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|As a professional musician and teacher of many genres of music, <br />I check out many albums all the time, and tire of the many <br />female vocalists who all begin to sound too similar, too  <br />contrived, set up with the same hip hop loops and samples, and <br />the same meaningless lyrics.  Alicia Keys is a blessing with <br />real talent and a completely refreshing sound.  Her voice is <br />rich and rarely needs multiple overdubs to cover vocal weak- <br />nesses as Janet Jackson, Britney, Brandy, and endless other <br />pop and r&b female singers do.  Her acoustic piano is a <br />beautiful sound that gives her old school soul/r&b mixed  <br />with hip hop a down to earth back to basics sound that has <br />become rare these days with over production and over techno <br />push button drums and synths.  Her hits \\"You Don't Know <br />My Name\\", \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" and \\"Diary\\" are wonderful, <br />but every other tune on the album is well done also and will <br />grow on you with every play.  Get this album, it is well <br />worth the money, and will outlast all those other trendy <br />CDs people wish they hadn't bought on impulse!
B00005JK8K|2.0|Fans of good war movies, Nicolas Cage, or John Woo should look elsewhere on all accounts.  This movie was a tedious bore.  Unfortunately, there was nothing much that could redeem this failure, but the premise of the Navajo \\"code talkers\\" to establish communication across enemy lines was an interesting subject that hasn't been used before (to my knowledge).  The acting from Nick Cage and Christian Slater was very flat, and those who are fond of Woo's action scenes (as I certainly am) will find great disappointment as the \\"feel of Woo\\" is almost completely absent here.  Director John Woo has crafted some fine high-octane violent entertainment in his past (i.e., The Killer, Hardboiled, Once A Thief, Bullet in the Head).  Most all have such wonderful visual flare & camera work that is undeniably HIS own.    For those who seek higher quality war films should not walk, but run to find BAND OF BROTHERS (the mini series is out on DVD now), SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, or PATHS OF GLORY.  All of the latter are a definite MUST SEE and will surely become timeless quality classics.
B00000099Y|1.0|Where's the appeal of being a Tool fan? Is it the scavenger hunt for all the Bill Hicks references? Is it the fact that Tool is almost prog-rock, but it's about 3% less nerdy than liking Rush? Perhaps it's the desire to be part of the most widely-hated club of music dorks this side of Insane Clown Posse fans (even Tool hates Tool fans: \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" and \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" come to mind). The amount of zealotry surrounding Tool is legendary.  <br /> <br />Tool fans think that only a select few posses the secret Tool decoder ring. They'd love to believe that all the halfwits who listen to Tool actually don't get it, but really they're all listening to them for the same reason. The fact of the matter is, any moron can understand Tool, but the hidden appeal of Tool lies in the fact that they give the illusion of being a band for smart people. They do this, as any Tool fan knows, by throwing in jumbled references to high school psychology, obscure religious references, and miscellaneous meaningless nonsense. Garbage or not, as long as there's something there to figure out or interpret, it's going to make some stoned dropout feel smart.  <br /> <br />  <br />Certainly there's more to like about Tool than just their connect-the-dots pseudo-intellectualism. For starters, there's Maynard James Keenan's (second stupidest name in pop music, next to Idlewild's Roddy Woomble) halting, breathy, nauseatingly affected crooning. He's like the Morrissey of hard rock. He's also a deep, poetic lyricist, having made millions of snickering Beavis-clones feel like subversive badasses for playing songs about fisting in their mom's minivans (to avoid a few angry idiots, let me just humor you and say \\"the song isn't really about fisting, there's like...a whole other deeper level, man\\"). Honestly, it's difficult to imagine how anyone could mistake his ham-fisted poetry for good. \\"My shadow / shedding skin / I've been picking / my scabs again.\\" It's certainly a lot closer to Reznor than it is to Yeats or Neruda. The man is just singing about angst and non-specific malaise, just like every other whiny hard-rock nerd. I'm sure Tool fans like to argue that he poignantly sings about his own traumatic history of abuse, but come on, it's not like that's a rare commodity these days; all it does is put him in the same lofty poetic stratosphere as the guy from Korn.  <br /> <br />A lot of Tool fans also like to talk about what an amazing drummer Danny Carey is just because he can do weird time signatures and that really fast prog-rock thumpa thumpa thumpa thing. As for the others, from everything I've ever heard of them, their guitar player and bassist are little more than passable.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, their albums are about as consistent as Russian roulette; for every catchy pop single like \\"46 and 2,\\" there's twice the volume of unlistenable time-filling crap. I'm glad the band loves their fans enough to include a German cookie recipe and an angry answering machine message. Lord knows they didn't buy the record expecting too many actual songs. Maybe their record label gives them some sort of bonus check if they make their CD exactly 79 minutes long.  <br /> <br />They're the ultimate hybrid of the two most nerdy and worthless styles of music: heavy metal and progressive rock. They barely manage to walk the fine line between complimenting the listener's intelligence and insulting it. They're responsible for introducing a level of hilarious faux-satanic mysticism to pop music that we haven't heard since Hotel California by the Eagles. Their crimes against humanity have not gone unpunished, though; they're forever cursed to have an unbearable fanbase, terrible haircuts, and videos so gloomy that they verge on hilarious. If you're a Tool fan and disagree with my summary, feel free to keep your worthless trap shut for once in your whining, self-involved life.  <br />
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Being familiar with Tim Burton's darker side, this tale was a relaxing breath of fresh southern hospitality air.  It was quite refreshing to watch a more heartwarming tale from Tim Burton as I generally regard him as an odd visionary.  Another noteable difference of Big Fish was how the acting was consistently good among the entire cast.  I was actually suspecting Albert Finney might receive a nomination for best supporting actor. <br /> <br />There are quite a few Burton-pleasing moments of visual tricks and friendly surprises.  And the narrative of the story consistently held my interest up to the very end.  (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) Without giving any details, I will say the \\"tale\\" given by the son at the film's end was a very nice touch. (END SPOILER ALERT). <br /> <br />However, as \\"nice\\" as this movie is, it never reached a true climactic point to elevate this picture from a NICE movie to a GREAT movie.  I kept expecting something bigger on an emotional level that it never quite reached.  Still, I was happy to see this and would recommend most to rent it on DVD or catch it on cable the next time it's on.
0316776963|5.0|I was just introduced to Me Talk Pretty One Day by a friend last month, since then I have read 3 books by Sedaris. I find his writing extremely entertaining. While I am reading his books and laughing to myself my 4 year old son keeps asking \\"what is so funny?\\".
B00009W0U4|4.0|After seeing this film I felt sick and nauseated, and because of this it is very hard for me to recommend this movie to anyone.  This movie features the most horrific murder scene in film history... period.  It also features an excruciatingly long and brutal rape scene (over 10 minutes) that is equally hard to watch.  Both are done with such graphic realism it is impossible to detect they are just an illusion.  The murder scene, in particular, is so realistic it still haunts me today.    So why am I giving this \\"trash\\" 4 stars?  Well, surprisingly this movie is far from it.  The acting and direction are both superb.  Irreversible also follows a Kubrick-like approach to filmmaking.  Both directors use the camera as a tool that allows the audience to simply observe what is going on at the particular moment.  You truly get the feeling you are a bystander watching what unfolds.  There is also a very meaningful scene towards the end where you see a poster of 2001 (Gaspar Noé must be a fan of Kubrick).    The structure is similar to Memento where it starts at the end and works its way back- one piece at a time.  In the beginning (or ending), the movie starts with a very dizzy camera approach showing a state of chaos that gradually settles down as the movie progresses to the end (or beginning).  If you are brave enough to attempt to watch this movie please don't let the camera work throw you!!!  It may seem annoying at first, but it is absolutely intentional.  You will get used to it and it does get better (I promise), and even during the dizzy moments it strategically slows down to a halt during key scenes before reverting again.  The camera work itself showcases the movie's tagline \\"time destroys everything\\" in how a state of being can radically change from wonderful peace and harmony to a tragic state of complete destruction.  This is a very shocking and disturbing film, and the experience will definitely stay with you... probably for the rest of your life.

Universal Music Group, Diana Krall, and Verve Music Group shall not be liable for any direct, indirect or consequential damages arising out of the use OR INABILITY [emphasis mine] to use this CD.\\" This is the warning that the record company put INSIDE the album, where you can't see it until you have opened it. Sneaky, huh?  This album probably will play in a normal CD player. It might play on your computer, but then again it might not. If not, you're outta luck, Buster. There is no warning on the outside.  <br /> <br />The Enhanced CD version of The Girl In the Other Room may interfere with the computer programs you normally use to play this disc, to compress the files so you can put it on your iPod or other personal music player, or to put the songs on your hard drive where you can conveniently listen at any time. \\"Enhanced CD\\" -- which is how the disc is labelled on the back cover -- sounds like something wonderful. In fact the functionality of the disc is crippled, not enhanced.  <br /> <br />If you can actually listen to this CD on your equipment, you will find that this is an artistic departure for Diana Krall. These are not jazz standards, but new pop tunes written by Diana and her husband Elvis Costello mixed with covers of other singer-songwriters.  <br /> <br />I believe this album provides a window to Diana's soul. Before, she was merely singing standards in her well-crafted way, but now she is FEELING music. Because this is such a change from her past albums, many people who only want to hear her sing Cole Porter standards or Gershwin tunes or other jazz age classics, will be bewildered and disappointed. Others, those with a wider range of tastes, those who appreciate a heartfelt performance of a good song in any genre, might find this new music a revelation, particularly the second half of the album. Her exquisite phrasing and piano accompaniment are still intact, and her fellow players provide gold medal-calibre chamber jazz backup.  <br /> <br />The title track is a standout, as are Narrow Daylight, I'm Coming Through, and Departure Bay. Her soaring, pulsing cover of Joni Mitchell's Black Crow is the epitome of jazz. Joni should be very pleased with this new interpretation.  <br /> <br />My own inclination is to give the music 5 stars. The recording quality is superb -- I'll give that at least 4 stars.  <br /> <br />As for Enhanced CDs, they are a scourge on the musical landscape. Obviously Verve presented the album with this technology to discourage people from ripping copies and MP3s and distributing them on the internet. But it will also discourage people from putting it on their portable music players, or on their computer hard drives for easy access. To me, that says that Verve does not trust its customers to responsibly use the products they purchase. Verve does not trust the integrity of Diana Krall's fans. As someone who has purchased quite a few Verve jazz CDs in the past two years, their vote of no confidence is galling. I resent any disc that attempts to automatically load programs on my computer without my express permission. I wonder if the CD/SACD hybrid version of the album would allow the full function that we have come to expect from industry standard compact discs.  <br /> <br />I applaud Diana Krall in her quest for artistic betterment. Her record company, however, is a Tricky Richard.
B00005JM02|5.0|Just when you thought Pixar couldn't possibly produce a better movie than their predecesor, they continuously succeed in an ever increasing challenge.  Finding Nemo is certainly no exception!  In fact, Finding Nemo is my personal favorite of the bunch.  The underwater animation is nothing short of spectacular (but of course, that is to be expected).  However, what sets this movie above the rest is its emotional heartfelt core. <br /> <br />The story toggles back and forth between a father (an over protective clown fish) and his lost son (a stubborn, but determined child trying to prove he can overcome his minor handicap).  Both parties face increasing danger as they attempt to reunite themselves before time runs out.  The result is a mixture of jaw-dropping excitement, dramatic tension, hillarious comedic moments, and a very special experience for both children and adults. <br /> <br />What is equally amazing is the writing team of Pixar.  They seem to be able to come up with fresher and more exciting ideas in their animated pictures than most other live-action studios to date.  Finding Nemo also uses Thomas Newman (The Shawshank Redemption/The Green Mile/Scent of a Woman) for the soundtrack which gives Finding Nemo a darker and more mature feel in contrast to the giddy happy music of Randy Newman (Toy Story). <br /> <br />I cannot wait to see what else Pixar has up their sleeve!
6305428557|4.0|In this kind of movies you miss the presence of a giant film maker . And Monger is a talented director but he lacks from the greatness sense , that absence of scope .<br /><br />Think for instance what would John Huston , David Lean , Franklin Schaffner (in the past) or  Jim Sheridan , Mike van Diem , Bertrand Tavernier , Kenny Loach , Aki Kaurismaki or Werner Herzog  would have done with such material - to name just a few examples of directors who seek the real esence behind the script - ?.<br /><br />These are one of the weird cases one misses the absence of commitment to appreciate the real impact which a film like this could become .<br /><br />The script , however , is excellent . To get a community inspire  by themselves to make all the possible efforts to reach the goal ; sixteen ground feet tall to become a hill in a mountain was an issue which really deserved something much more than a funny entertainment .<br /><br />Nevertheless the story is so original and strong that it remains by itself above all .<br /><br />Watch this little but unvaluable gem .
B00003CXDG|3.0|Although I can sympathize with reviewers who rated this movie poorly, it is evident the majority of negative responses are from those unfamiliar with John Woo. Very few times will I dare say the story might be secondary to the \\"heart\\" of a movie. This rarity only occurs when the source of that enjoyment comes from something above and beyond what the average moviegoer can experience.    Here is a case when the director is the actual \\"star\\" of the film. There is truly a magic with nearly all of his movies (we'll forget about Broken Arrow or Windtalkers for the time being) that no matter how implausible or phony the plot may be, there is such a majestic quality to Woo's art that one can't help but be amazed at what is being shown on screen.  Those familiar with some of his best ones (like his Chinese films Hardboiled & The Killer) are very aware of his trademarks.  These trademarks are not subtle in the least, but unless you know exactly what you *should* be looking for, you may feel lost (Did you ever wonder why a few select people in the theater loudly cheered during odd moments- like when a white dove was flying away in elaborate slow motion?).     It is unfortunate that watching Woo's previous works is sort of a prerequisite. There literally isn't one second that goes by without Woo's fingerprints everywhere. A similar example of how powerful a fan base can boost popularity are those who like Jackie Chan. His films are notorious for bad writing, terrible dialogue, and questionable acting.  Still, Jackie Chan became a popular icon across the world because of what his talent really is about.  Fans of Jackie Chan would feel cheated if it didn't showcase his insane death-defying stunts or his comical drawn-out fight scenes no matter how good the writing, dialogue, and acting may be.    Likewise, I must also grant this movie is purely cheap popcorn entertainment and should not be compared to other well written masterpieces like Schindler's List, The Sixth Sense, Memento, or American Beauty. MI:2 can, and should be compared to other movies of the action/spy genre. I don't know about the rest of you, but I found the story of MI:2 to be more interesting than the last 3 James Bond films combined.
6304711891|4.0|This movie is breathtaking . And once more Sean Connery stole the show . His ravishing acting literally gave the required dosis of reflexive , inquiring and chess mate mind who will allow him as the effective antihero to win his particular challenge and personal when he must face the master and commander leader of this renegade corp of soldiers who decided to menace San Francisco if their demands are not satisfied. They are looking for the late recognizement and economic benefits for the family of those soldiers who fell in the war .<br />The film is hyperkinetic ; the action scenes are loaded of high tension thanks to a credible script it keeps your interest till the end .<br />Even the formal considerations are a question of fairness , the main reason who led these soldiers to act by themselves will vanish progressively , looking for the action instead the dramatic nucleus .<br />Nevertheless the film deserves its own place . It has personality<br />and character and that is a triumph by itself in the actuality.
B00009UW0N|5.0|On October 25th, 1978, one week before Halloween, a low budget independent horror movie shocked and scared the living crap out of audiences across the country.  Today, 25+ years later, the first installment of the Halloween franchise still remains as one of the scariest motion pictures ever made.  Hell, I am going to go out on a limb and just flat out say it is THE scariest movie ever made hands down!<br /><br />John Carpenter not only thrilled us with his tight direction, but he also composed the \\"Halloween Theme\\" soundtrack that gives just about anyone the goosebumps (even those who haven't seen this movie).  Halloween was shot on a shoestring budget, but that is also part of its charm as it gives the movie a very eerie and realistic feel.<br /><br />The movie takes place during one complete day... on Halloween.  Autumn leaves are blowing on the sidewalk under a grey-filled sky while kids are walking to their classrooms.  Little do they know the impending severity of the situation as a serial killer by the name of \\"Michael Meyers\\" recently escaped from a secured mental institution.  What soon follows is one gut-wrenching suspenseful scene after another.  If you can manage to keep your stomache from twisting in knots, you are not human!<br /><br />The portrayal of this serial killer is what haunts audiences the most.  He wears an emotionless mask while he calmly murders his victims.  There are many times when you can see his 1st person perspective through the mask and hear his breathing while he \\"stalks\\" his prey.  The creepiness factor of this character is off the charts!  There are many scenes where you can catch a brief glimpse of him in the shadows, behind bushes, or around corners (but never for more than a couple seconds).  John Carpenter utilizes the suspense of Hitchcock where you/the audience knows more than the characters interacting on screen.<br /><br />Just when you think things can't get any worse, they do.  And more.  The tension constantly grows to where it is almost unbearable- even up to its long-lingering memorable conclusion that will keep you awake for many nights.<br /><br />This movie is also what made Jamie Lee Curtis the \\"slasher queen\\" star she became in subsequent horror films.  Its popularity and cult status yielded sequel after sequel, parody after parody, and copy after copy and was the first to come up with the \\"killer is invincible\\" idea.  When will Hollywood realize that special effects rarely fright, but it takes an original idea to get it right?ven up to its long-lingering memorable conclusion that will keep you awake for many nights.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Okay, let me begin by stating that my rating for this item (five stars) is, as always with boxed sets, the average of the three items. I am a massive Star Wars fan, and I feel that this trilogy is second only to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy from New Line Cinema. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that \\"A New Hope\\" is my fifth favorite film if all time. (That would be after the three LOTR films, Jaws, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.) I know that most people like \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" the best, but I like \\"A New Hope\\" just slightly more. Now, I like each of the five films from greatest to least in this order. <br /> <br />\\"A New Hope\\" (Five Stars) <br />\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (five stars) <br />\\"Attack of the Clones\\" (four stars) <br />\\"Return of the Jedi\\" (four stars) <br />\\"The Phantom Menace\\" (three stars) <br /> <br />Other than \\"Episode I\\" which damaged the \\"Star Wars\\" legacy forever, each of these movies are monumental achievements. The effects have been redone a bit in these special editions (that monster in the sand has a mouth, The Emporer explodes when he dies, etc.), which keeps them fresh and exciting. I've always been a defender of \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" and I don't understand why so many people don't like it. Admittedly, it pales in comparison to its predecessors, but its a very good film nonetheless. One thing I notice is that film trilogys usually start out very well and then get progressively worse. The Matrix trilogy is a superb example of this (even though I liked \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" a lot.) I'm getting off topic. If you've never seen the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, do yourself a favor and buy this set. You should also watch the prequels, even though \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is pretty mediocre.
B0002IQHY8|3.0|Valid path is interesting. But, That's all. To be honest, I was disappointed at first, because I was expecting the music to be comparable to TIME MACHINE or ON AIR. I really miss the signature Ian Bairnson guitar. Check out \\"Ignorance Is Bliss\\" What a fantastic SONG!! Some of the other longtime Band Associates are missing as well. Electronic music is OK but, not a favorite of mine. This CD is Interesting but, previous CD'S are better!

THE SCRIPT IS PRETTY BAD, AND THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO PLOT. AND WHEN AGENT SMITH GOES (...) AT THE END, THERE'S NO EMOTIONAL IMPACT. THIS IS REALLY NOT WORTH SEEING, SO I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING IMPORTANT. TRINITY GETS IMPALED. THE HUMANS AND THE MACHINES MAKE A TRUCE. A FEW PEOPLE NAMELESS FACELESS PEOPLE GET RIPPED TO SHREDS.

The only complaint I have about the remaster is the vocals. You might ask why because we all know that Dave Mustaine's voice isn't that good to start with. Right you are. But I actually dig Mustaine's voice on the original album. I don't know why but his voice sounded a little more whiney on the remaster. But never the less this is a killer album. The volume on here is a lot better than the original. If you want some classic thrash then get this cd. Also pick up the rest of Megadeth's catalog, good stuff. Nuff said now push the buy button.

B00005JN2X|4.0|In COLLATERAL, Tom Cruise, TOP GUN hunk and LAST SAMURAI swashbuckling hero, has his first Bad Guy role that I can recall as he plays a vicious, cold-blooded assassin-for-hire. Say it ain't so, Tom! Did ex-wife Nicole Kidman suspect his darker side, you think?<br /><br />Here, Jamie Foxx plays Max, a low-achieving Los Angeles cabbie with dreams flogging the PM shift, who picks up Vincent (Cruise), who's just arrived in the city. Ostensibly, as Vincent explains, he's in town to gather overnight five signatures on a real estate deal before flying out the next morning. Vincent offers Max $700 to be his chauffeur for the wee hours before delivering him back to the airport on time. It isn't until Max's first stop, during which a body falls on the windshield of his ride from a fourth story window, that he realizes that perhaps his tip for the gig isn't big enough. Unfortunately, Vincent, with inexorable persuasion, says \\"drive on\\", after loading the body into the trunk. As the corpses begin to accumulate at various locales around the city, a street smart cop begins to connect the dots, and the chase is on.<br /><br />During the first two-thirds of the film, Vincent philosophizes about the inescapable presence of politically incorrect Death in the world, and his unremarkable and necessary role as a Grim Reaper. At times, the two men almost seem on the verge of bonding, as when Vincent bails Max out during an over-the-radio dispute with the latter's overbearing boss-dispatcher. And when Max apparently takes Vincent's advice to take the carpe diem thing more seriously than procrastinating his dreams as is his wont. But Max's overriding horror at the night's killing spree wins out.<br /><br />The last third of COLLATERAL degenerates into a typically Tinseltownish Babe-in-Peril-Saved-in-the Nick-of-Time scenario - something that should be suspected during the first 15 minutes, when Max emotionally connects with a fare,  a smart yet engagingly vulnerable Federal prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) who needs to work late at the office prepping for tomorrow's opening of a big case. Now, while there's nothing wrong with that, and it is a nail-biter, it's not consistent with the refreshingly intelligent scripting of what came before. Thus, I can only award 4 stars for a failure to follow through.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore has strung together many facts that we all know to be fact and then in between those facts he has squeezed lies.  His desire is that the ignorant American public will assume that because before and after is truth, the lie must also be true. <br /> <br />Also, part of making a quality documentary is making sure that the entire story is shown.  Instead, this movie represents the highlights of what Moore saw.  Anyone who had taken in all the events in sequence and perspective would not have come to the same overly biased opinion of the events.  This movie is like putting George Bush on trial for only two hours and never giving him a chance for defence.  Its a good thing Michael Moore didn't design our court system. <br /> <br />Sadly, Americans too often lack the disipline and the intelligence to look for the story not told.  Michael Moore is obviously a film maker and not a analysts or political strategist.  He excells at portraying his vision, but lacks even the desire to be an objective story teller, thus this is not a documentary.  He needs to read more books about politics and economics from multiple viewpoints, not just the liberal viewpoints that tell him what he wants to hear.   Pathetic really.  Neither side of the political spectrum is always right or always wrong.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I will not fill you with mindless rhetoric about how this is a propagandist film, how it is nothing but complete fiction, or about how Michael Moore is a supposed Nazi. Instead I will simply state the truth: there are wrong facts in this movie. <br /> <br />1. The Saudi flights out of the U.S.A. were cleared by Richard Clarke, not by George Bush, so why even bring it up?  <br /> <br />2. The Carlyle Group, a military supplies group of which George Bush Sr. was a major affiliate of, was in the process of creating a missile program that would benefit the both the Bush family and the Saudi family when if it was sold to the military. However, this missile program was actually cancelled by the Bush Administration. Kinda hard to get money out of a cancelled program.   <br /> <br />3. The film suggests that most of the media was swayed by Fox News to say that Bush had actually won the Florida electoral vote. Fox News, however, called the state for Gore during the first count. <br /> <br />4. Mr. Moore implies that Iraq was a nice country. I mean, doesn't kids playing in the local parks show that? Come on, Mike. Saddam killed 1 Million of his own people. Do you think that 900 American lives can compete with that? Or did they just die for nothing? <br /> <br />Overall, it is my belief that Michael Moore is far too nationalistic to feel the pains of other countries. Oh, and just for the record, can any of you Moore supporters tell me how much money Mr. Moore donated to the families of victims of both the 9/11 attacks and the Iraqi war, the victims who he's trying to defend nobly? How about nothing! <br />
B000067DNC|5.0|Excellent continuation of the SG-1 team's adventures.  Season two and three are my favorites: 2 for the stories, 3 for the visuals.  You can't go wrong with either season! <br /> <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|Let's clear the air here. Star Trek was released on the \\"2-fer\\" discs. Fine. Whether we agree with it or not, it's yesterday's news and we can't change it. Let's get a life. These DVDs are not the only product that has been repackaged. As for the present, it's great to see Star Trek released as full seasons, although a bit pricey. Other programs go for $35 - $55 a season. There's no reason why Star Trek can't be in that range.     I agree with other posters that my cable tv may be done. I'll be better off buying DVDs I like rather than being ripped off by the cable company every month.
B00004RF97|4.0|This film is famous enough--justifiably, I might add--that I need not provide a synopsis. IMHO, it would be pretty hard not to enjoy the delicious antics played out in this Broadway-hit-turned-Hollywood-classic unless, like a previous reviewer, you have an extreme aversion to any of its cast members. No, my complaint is with the print itself.  Little or no restoration has been done, leaving images somewhat flickery and not very sharp with fairly poor contrast. Warner has done fine work on some of its other releases but I'm now inclined to wonder if it only applies to non-MGM titles--perhaps a little unresolved rivalry in evidence? There are subtitle and caption options and the lone extra is the original trailer which looks no worse in quality than the film itself. Sound is clear, plain-vanilla mono which is fine since that's how it was originally released.  This film was remade as a musical, High Society, in 1956 starring beautiful Grace Kelly who was, coincidentally, the daughter of Philadelphia parvenus before retiring to become Princess of Monaco. I personally prefer the original and would add that, predictably, Hepburn provides more convincing depiction of Yankee royalty as she was closer to the genuine article (I believe she was a DAR). My advice is that if you're a fan for whom this is a must-own (and I include myself among these numbers), try not to pay list for this no-frills release and hope for better things in the future.

B00005UEAR|4.0|This is possibly Dream Theater's most daring album. It's reminscent of all their previous works maintaining that DT feel, but is executed in a very different. One of the most interesting things about Dream Theater is it's fanbase. They're all over. Some people prefer the more metal edge, some prefer the more epic and prog like songs, and others like the simpler mellow pieces. You can never tell what the next DT album will sound like because they aren't conistent.  <br /> <br />When I first picked up this album I was a little dissapointed. I was blown away by the 13 minute metal epic Glass Prison, but the rest of the first disc was very bizzare. The second disc reminded me too much of Scenes From a Memory. But, as with most good music, you can't really appreciate or comprehend the true beauty of music with one casual listening. After awhile this was the only CD I would listen to. The uplifting sound of Blind Faith, the eerie yet soothing Misunderstood, to the harsh Great Debate, the first disc seemed to hold a vast array of gems. But it was Disappear that took hold of me. It reminded me a great deal of Space Dye-Vest, the kind of songs that accent James Vocals perfectly. <br /> <br />Disc two takes some getting used to. Obviously taking the whole thing in one sitting can be quite overwheling. The Overture is somewhat lackluster, kinda just foreshadowing some of the major riffs to come. About to Crash is different, an almost campy tune. War Inside my Head/The Test that Stumped Them All are the two agressive numbers, the first being quite short, and the latter is something that I think your gunna either love or hate. Goodnight Kiss is pretty simple and unengaging. Solitary Shell is probably the most commercial song here, but it's done in a good way, very Another Day-esque. About to Crash(reprise) sounds like an old fashioned rocker, and Losing Time is an adequate ending. Overall, it's not really 1 song, but a bunch of little songs, that aren't really like anything DT'sdone before. Some people are gunna like em, and others may not be all too impressed. It just depends. <br /> <br />6 Degrees is very hard to give a rating to. I give it four stars because obviously it isn't perfect, but is one of my most listened to CD's as well. If your a big fan of Awake and Falling Into Infinity you'll prolly like this disc as well.
B00005JN2F|4.0|Sequels do not always pan out. As many people would agree, riding on the back of a box office hit is usually an effort to make more cash, and as a result, the quality of the sequel reflects this. Not so with The Bourne Supremacy. In many ways it's better than the first, in terms of tight editing, Damon's overall performance, and that over the top car chase through the streets of Moscow, at the end of the film, which had me gripping the arm rests of my seat.<br /><br />Matt Damon was recently here in Melbourne promoting the film and he worked hard, appearing on every major Australian talk show as well as several popular morning radio stations. Australians like Matt Damon because he comes across as honest, no pretenses, your average all-American clean cut young man. In fact I remember him saying in one of his interviews that he was hesitant to do the sequel because he was afraid the quality of the film would suffer, but he ended up agreeing to do the project when he found out who would be directing. Paul Greengrass did a fine job, as the realism of the picture is first rate. Originally a documentary filmmaker, he brought his sense of realism to the project. Some have commented that the editing was too tight, jagged in places, almost acting as a distraction. Perhaps this is true in places, but generally, in my opinion, the editing was a work of art - well timed and realistic.<br /><br />This is a great action film sequel that in some cases surpassed the original.<br /><br />A strong four and a half stars.
B0000024K1|4.0|Want relief from modern \\"gangster\\" rap?  Want to hear old school rap?  Well, then this is the CD for you.  This is when rap had a cause and a feeling. <br /> I myself am not a huge fan of rap, but I can appreciate the early beginnings.  Like I said, rap actually discussed issues, and important issues, albeit from interesting angles.  Public Enemy knew how to do it too.  I am sure most of you know their style, but for those of you who do not, or are too young to know, they sound like the Beastie Boys, at least to a degree.  I do not know whether this is the best Public Enemy album or not, but this one certainly has power, as their group did.  Public Enemy influenced many, as is seen in a brief instance in Limp Bizkit's new song, Phenomenon.  Their affect on modern rap is even vaster than that.   <br />         This is why the CD is as good as it is.  Because of what Public Enemy has done for music, and just the sound of this CD itself, this album gets a four star rating. <br />
B000002UAX|4.0|Frank is obviously not much of a historian in regards to rock or pop music.  To compare the Beatles to the Back Street Boys is like comparing filet mignon to a McDonald's cheeseburger.  I believe in his review, he must have been thinking about the Monkees, not the Beatles, when he wrote about the band got started ('get a couple good-looking guys', etc.).  Of course, even the Pre-fab Four were a better band than BSB, never mind the Beatles, Stones, Who, Cream, Hendrix, CCR, and so forth.  Now, to explain my rating of the White Album, this is (in my most humble opinion) a four-star album only in comparison to other Beatles albums.  Revolver, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, and Abbey Road rank somewhat higher.  However, the creativity, originality, and diversity of the White Album still elevate it far above pretty much anything found in today's pop.  Most bands would thrill to have even one album this good.  The Back Street Boys would be lucky to come close to matching Beatles For Sale (arguably the Fab Four's weakest album), let alone any of their other albums, or any album from rock's most creative and original period.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|I started watching the first season only after the first few eps. it's such a great show. I love Lorelai's wit and she just tends to go on and on and i love the way she dresses. Singapore's a bit behind in the series seasons. The local channel is only broadcasting the 5th season now. I've been waiting since forever for the DVD to be released. My hubby sent it to Singapore for me =) Can't wait for the 2nd season!
B00003CXAT|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. Steven Speilberg's thrilling blockbuster masterpiece that became the highest grossing movie in worldwide box office history for some time. On an Island of the coast of Costa Rica, John Hammond has set up a biological reserve with genetically engineered dinosaurs, the result: JURASSIC PARK. He has invited paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, Paleobotanist Dr. Elly Satler, Dr. Ian Malcom and his grandchildren Tim and Lex. When the power is shut down and the dinosaurs get loose from their electric fences. the park is no longer safe. The menacing T-Rex,Velicoraptors and many others are out on the island. What began as weekend excursion became a fight for survival from prehistory's greatest beasts. This film is one of Speilberg's best,an imaginative,brilliant,thrilling roaring ride,a triumph for all ages to enjoy. Steven Speilberg was the king of movie animals from JAWS to Jurassic Park. One of the most honoral films ever and  one of the most honorable for visual effects, the dinosaurs are one of the most real looking animals ever on the screen. I recommend this for a dinosaur movie,a speilberg movie and great movie all around. If Like Jurassic Park you should see the Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. this is an thrilling epic not to be missed and it seems only yesterday this was this ruled the box office in 1993, it is the highest grossing movie of 93 and in my opinon the best of 93. Bring home one of  cinema history's greatest triumphs. Welcome to Jurassic Park.
B0002I831S|5.0|Finally!!!!! Better Pricing for Star Trek Series<br /><br />I agree with other customers about Paramount's unfair pricing of the Star Trek series. I too refused to buy the single DVD packages that would have cost over $800 ($20 * 40 (2 shows per DVD) about $10 per show as compared to the about $2.90 per show in the box set... plus you get more stuff in the set. Ouch!!!<br /><br />As far as TV series marketing is concerned season box sets are the way to go but Paramount still needs to learn about pricing for success. Take for example the StarGate SG1 series.. very well priced around $52 and a mover in sales.<br /><br />Come on... the material while still good is after all over 38 years old!!!!!!!!<br /><br />We all love Star Trek but the paramount price for the ST series needs work however this new set is a step in the right direction.
B00004U8JV|4.0|Four Years after the disaster at Jurassic Park, the thrills continue in Steven Speilberg's top notch blockbuster sequel, The Lost World:Jurassic Park. The adventure continues when John Hammond esembles a team of experts led by Dr. Ian Malcom to set for the island Ilsa Sorna to investigate dinosaurs that have survived there, they bred the dinosaurs there and transfered them to Isla Nublar, the location of Jurassic Park. but another team assembled by Hammond's nephew comes to the island to take the animals of the island. Malcom's team and the other team join together, they are soon hunted down by T-rexs and raptors. It's a fight for survival to San Diego, a T-Rex is loose there, it's up to Ian Malcom to stop anyone trying to get that T-Rex. This one of the best sequels ever, one of Speilberg's and Universal's best. It has the same thrills as the first movie, another triumph from Speilberg. Anyone who says this a bad sequel, you don't anything about sequels or possibly movies period, this was thrilling rip roaring,imaginative DINO-MITE sequel. This was # 1 movie of summer 97, released on Memorial Day. If you Like Jurassic Park continue the thrills of genetically engineered dinosaurs with one of cinema history's greatest sequels. Mommy's Very Angry
B00003CXBK|5.0|alot has been said and heard about the master film maker hayao miyazaki's astonishing masterpiece \\"princess mononoke\\". no words are enough to describe the sheer beauty and grandeur of the film. we all know that.  <br /> <br />miramax definitely deserves a pat for bringing it to the english world. only thing that sulks me is the absence of any great extras on this dvd release. it is a real irony that an exceptional film like this has been given such a shoddy treatment. i purchased it long ago when it was released by miramax, thinking someday there will be a special edition release. since then many years lapsed but there's absolutely no sign of any such release. something i would like to add here is that buena vista japan has released a very special 3disc deluxe edition dvd there, in japan, which alongwith, the main feature, contains the whole storyboard of the film in multi angle viewing option and a very special long documentary on the making of the film (sigh!!!). and that's just not all...there has even been a separate dvd release called \\"how mononoke hime was born\\"!! great stuff, i'm sure! <br /> <br />WITH THIS REVIEW OF MINE AND ON BEHALF OF MILLIONS OF FANS LIKE ME AROUND THE GLOBE, I REQUEST BUENA VISTA,U.S. AND DISNEY TO KINDLY RELEASE THIS DELUXE EDITION ON REGION1. <br /> <br />I ALSO REQUEST AMAZON TO KINDLY START A SURVEY AND LET THE STUDIO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR ITS RELEASE AND DYING TO OWN IT. PLEASE EVERYONE, VOTE FOR IT. I'M SURE IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS IT DID BEFORE THE RELEASE OF PRESENTLY AVAILABLE EDITION, WHEN DISNEY WAS FORCED TO ADD THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE TRACK ON THE DISC AFTER PEOPLE HAD RAISED THEIR VOICES. <br /> <br />DISNEY, WE WANT THIS ONE.
B000002OTL|5.0|I will not talk about the movie, you already know it rocks, you already know it's one of the best films ever made, almost everyone agrees with that, a movie masterpiece. <br />This soundtrack is as good as music as the film was in characters and situations... Tarantino has done an amazing job in this soundtrack. <br />Even though I'm not much of a fan of music from the 50s, 60s and 70s, this soundtrack just made me love nearly every single song in it. The best songs are: Let's Stay Together, Lonesome Town, Son Of A Preacher Man, You Never Can Tell, Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon and Flowers On The Wall - all of them magnific songs. Not to mention the dialogues and the instrumental music - Misirlou and Surf Riders are movie classics. <br />Overall, this is a CD everyone should own. Soundtrack collectors, music fans... Everyone. If there was a Top 100 Soundtracks, you could be sure: Pulp Fiction would be in Top 5.
B00020BVXI|1.0|dont let the attractive cover fool you, spider-man 3disc deluxe edition dvd has nothing much to offer. what you get is the same old widescreen edition (2disc) dvd and a separate disc which boasts of offering all new special features but actually disappoints badly. all these so called new features, fail to impress. these features are nothing but short segments showing just the actors on the set of the film. it being a deluxe edition release something better was expected especially an in depth look on the visual effects would have been highly appreciated. even the preview of spider-man2 lasts hardly for few minutes and theatrical trailer is just not the stuff you'll buy this deluxe edition for! moreover looking at the running time of the third disc, which not even is one hour, i feel all these \\"new features\\" could have been easily pushed in the 2disc edition of the film. <br /> <br />spider-man deluxe edition is nothing but an eyewash...a gimmick..and a let down. if you are planning to own spider-man on dvd go for the good old 2disc edition. it has all the interesting extras you are looking for. deluxe edition is just not worth your hard earned money.
B00000I41G|4.0|If you happen to be up after midnight, this is definitely the best album to fit into your cd player.  Kenny Burrell plays the blues unlike any other guitarist I've ever heard, he's laid-back while still very exciting.  The album features Burrell, Stanley Turrentine on tenor sax (this is the best he ever sounded in my opinion), Major Holley Jr. on bass, Bill English on drums, and Ray Barretto on conga.  The chemistry between Burrell and Turrentine is amazing, probably partly due to the fact that these two played together on Jimmy Smith's \\"Back at the Chicken Shack\\" and \\"Midnight Special\\".  The album is made up of 8 Burrell originals (\\"K Twist\\" and \\"Kenny's Sound\\" are never-before-released tracks) and one standard.  The mood that is started in \\"Chitlins con Carne\\" stays throughout all the other tracks, no matter the tempo.  Alfred Lion called this his favorite Blue Note session, and for good reason, so pick up this gem right now! rating: 4.5
B00005JLEU|5.0|what a spectacular dvd release of the greatest animated film ever made (its not i who say this, just go to IMDB.COM)! this dvd, undoubtedly, is the best release of a studio ghibli film by disney and buena vista so far. this is the treatment films like these deserve. <br /> <br />the most delighting feature in this 2disc set is \\"the nippon tv special\\", showing the in depth making of the film at studio ghibli. all the footage seen in this long documentary is real and live, of the time when the work on the film was on in studio ghibli which makes it different and all the more interesting to watch. the tension, the pressure, the workload...what we get to see here is all real unlike the people involved in it just sitting in front of the camera, all made up, talking big. <br /> <br />it was also good to see people from disney, including glen keane (tarzan) and others, speaking about the exceptional work of miyazaki and the influence it had on them, in another short \\"the art of spirited away\\" on disc1. <br /> <br />mr miyazaki always prefers speaking with his matchless work...films like this one, princess mononoke, nausicaa and totoro have proved that time and again. <br /> <br />i only hope all the upcoming ghibli releases by disney get the same treatment. meanwhile disney and buena vista deserve a two thumbs up for this one!  <br /> <br />go get this one before it is out of stock. it is one hell of a dvd you'll never regret having.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I JUST RECENTLY NOTICED HIS RAPPING TECHINIQUE.....HE USES VERY BASIC WORDS AND JUST REUSES THEM OVER AND OVER IN HIS LINES. WHICH IS WHY IT IS EASY FOR HIM TO MAKE WORDS RHYME ONE AFTER THE OTHER. IF YOU WERE TO USE HOOD AND 'GHETTO SLANG, IT'S HARDER TO DO.   <br /> <br />OVERALL, HE'S A GREAT LYRICIST, VERY TALENTED. BUT PEOPLE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE WAY HE RAPS.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Far more faithful to the spirit, characters and sense of the Liaisons dangereuses than either of the two ridiculous costume dramas which get the novel all wrong. I never use films in my French literature classes. But I use this one.
B00004W52U|5.0|Even though they spawned Rancid, and thus spawned a never ending stream of poppy sounding, over-produced garbage that has been labeled as punk, ska, etc., Operation Ivy has proved to have been quite an influence, and this disc is definite proof.  \\"Knowledge\\", \\"Sound System\\", \\"Take Warning\\", \\"One of These Days\\", \\"Gonna Find You\\", \\"Bad Town\\", and of course, \\"Yellin' in My Ear\\" are all essential tracks showcasing the beginning of what would become the ska movement (trumpets weren't always necessary) and cement Operation Ivy as one of the genre's true all time great bands.  I've said it before and I'll say it until the day I take the big dirt nap, forget Avril Lavine, Sum 41, Green Day, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, and anything else that calls themselves punk and sells millions of albums.  You want real punk, check this out, check out the Misfits, Minor Threat, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, or Fugazi to hear the real definition of punk rock, and leave all that other mainstream nonsense in the dirt.
B00006LWSF|4.0|Hey, Blob \\"Blob\\".  How can you deny Eminem's talent?  Could you think of lines like \\"sometimes I just feel like/quittin I still might/Why do I put up this fight/Why do I still write/Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics/And show these people what my level of skills like/But I'm still white/Sometimes I jst hate life/Something ain't right/Hit the brake lights/Case of the stage fright/Drawin a blank light//\\"?  I don't think so!!  I can't give this 5 stars, because that makes it a classic, which it's not, but it's a great CD.
B000001Y5X|4.0|I have had this album for quite sometime and I used to listen to it a lot.  But three years later my musical prefrences have changed quite a bit.  I saw it on my cd rack and decided to pop it in to see if I still would like it and I still do.  It is very catchy with simple riffs, drum beats and melodies but they are all great.  Songs like Dope Hat, Lunchbox and Cake and Sodomy are infectious and I am always happy to replay them.  It is a shame that Marilyn Manson isn't like this anymore, the music was FUN although a bit disgusting.  The strongest thing about the album is, like I stated before, is the melodies. They are simple but incredibly fun to hum.  This band lost that along the way. All in all pick up this album if you want to hear manson before all the media hype.
B000059RL3|5.0|To listen to Marvin Gaye when he is riding one of his grooves on the What's Going On album is to be one with the very clouds themselves.  As I listened to this album for the first time recently, I marveled at the way the songs seamlessly flowed together and, well......that way it grooved!  But this album is no mere candyland of soulful funk-and no whim that this work made Rolling Stone magazine's 100 greatest albums of all-time. It is a masterpiece of social commentary.  Have no doubts whatsoever, \\"What's Going On\\" is one of the most songs of outrage ever put to tape.  You can hear this further, just listen to the whole album.  Gaye's voice is both sad and sublime in not just the title song, but also \\"Flyin' High (In The Friendly Sky)\\".  For me, the shivers came with the successive three songs \\"Save The Children\\", \\"God Is Love\\", and \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\"-on these Gaye attains heights of such aural beauty, you will be hard put to experience such sonic etherealness in the near future of your life; not only that, these songs will move not just your heart, but also your feet.  To respond to one reviewer who said the extras on this edition were kind of disappointing, NAY!  I found everything to be a treat.  The alternate Detroit mix definitely has a heavier vocal lean, which can see seen the way it plays out across your headphones.  The second disc is a concert he did in 1972.  It's looser than what you hear on the album; I especially liked the Sixties Medley  and Right On.  Granted, by the time the last note finishes on the second disc, you might be sick of the title song, \\"What's Going On\\" (since there are six different versions on this deluxe edition!), but just hit the forward button and enjoy the rest.
B000001Y2U|5.0|The second full album by Marilyn Manson is much different than its predecessor. Gone are the fun melodies, bouncy riffs and the overall carnival-like feel of the debut.  This album is much more abrasive, dark and powerful.  The riffs are still overly simple but they bite much harder than those of Portrait, Mansons vocals are much more edgey and volitle.  What is best about this album though is the overall consistancy is great than that of Portrait. <br />   Portrait had many great songs but the end of the album dragged on quite a bit with slow songs that lasted the longest.  This album is longer (20 songs 77 minutes) but the songs don't drag. They are fast, hit hard and are straight to the point.  None of the songs are bad in my opinion and the Reznor's production helps quite a bit.  This was their last great album and it's a shame. They could've done much more.  One of my favorite 90s mainstream albums.
B0001JXQEM|3.0|Weezer's first album (aka The Blue Album) was a fresh breeze of music air amidst the staleness of the grunge rock that was beginning to repeat itself, and the harder edge that the next wave of alternative music was taking on.  Their concert to promote this album wasn't bad either--who else would perform on stage with a cardboard Chewbacca?  Hence my complaint about the Deluxe Edition of their excellent album--why so little?  Yes there is a disk's worth of B-sides, but when you get down to it, there are only six real B-cuts here whereas the rest are rehashes.  There are many other deluxes out on the market that bury this one in content choice and quality:  check out the Marvin Gaye releases or The Who's Leeds and My Generation albums.  Surely they could have found more alternate studio takes, and concert cuts, especially \\"Undone\\" (my personal fav); it's a shame about the lack of concert versions, because \\"Jonas\\" and \\"Surf Wax\\" to use a reviewer's cliche', really capture their onstage energy.  Although I've never been big on them in general, the demos definitely reflect a rawer, more garagey side of the band, especially with \\"Paperface\\" and \\"Lullaby For Wayne\\".  So, if you don't have the Weezer blue album, this will be a good buy, but for those of you already on your second CD copy, this may not as definitive a buy as you would wish (and pay) for--but it's something, at least.
B00003CX5P|5.0|In my opinion, the Star Wars prequels are strictly for fans. Anybody can understand the original Trilogy, but the story isn't very clear in the prequels, and anybody who watches Episode 1 just because it's another movie to watch won't be satisfied. I think it's going to take Episode 3 to clear up everything for those of us who haven't figured the story out, but that should be expected. Each movie is part of a story, and not meant to be a story to be enjoyed on its own. Think about it. When you read a book, are the first few chapters very exciting or enjoyable. Most of the time they aren't, and that's because they are there for the sole purpose of helping you understand the rest of the story. I guess most people don't think of it this way and look at the movies as junk. Everyone I know who isn't a big fan says the prequels were bad and I expect that, although I don't like it. Fortunately, with the release of Episode 3 we can go back to Episodes 1 and 2, and understand everything. For those of you who are not big Star Wars fans, let me tell you this. The plot is real simple; it's just not obvious. Oh, and if you think this is still about the Empire and the Rebellion, it's not. Everything in Episodes 1-6 is about Palpatine and his attempt to rule the galaxy with Anakin at his side, which leads to Anakin bring balance to the Force. That's all there is. Keep in mind that Palpatine may be Darth Sidious, who has the same ambition. Also, anything bad that happens against the Republic, is because of Darth Sidious. That's all. Hopefully all you non-fans understand things more clearly now. Sorry that this strayed away from the Episode 1 DVD. The bonus features were pretty good, and I strongly suggest it to anyone who likes the movie. Thanks for reading.
B00005JMX6|1.0|a very poorly constructed film, specifically plot-wise. like  a previous reviewer stated, it's a \\"risky business\\" rip-off. The characters are not believeable, even loathsome and arrogant, especially the young boy who falls for this girl next door. The kicker is that the actual \\"girl\\" in girl next door serves no real purpose, she could have been just a cut out poster of some talent-less actress/model babe, well, maybe she was...this is not worth buying, it's a sad retelling of Hollywood nonsense, basically saying that the love of a young male can curb the damged self esteem of a young girl who has made some adult films. I mean, we never learn WHY she did porn, WHY she is this person who she is, actually, we learn little about who she is as a person. a very flimsy film, do not rent, buy, or speak its name, tis pure evil.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Sorry about that Chief. After listening to the ROTK sountrack start to end I find it a bit.......incomplete. Seems to be a common thread these days, you buy a CD 'cuz you really loved the Movie and the COOL parts are shortened or missing completely. Loved 'The White Tree' just awesome. One word. Goosebumps. Otherwise a fine CD to round out the trilogy.
0385336810|4.0|I have heard much about Confessions of a Shopaholic, but Can You Keep a Secret? is the first book from Sophie Kinsella that I have read, and I must say I am not disappointed.  From page one, I was smiling and laughing throughout the book, which is rare for me.  Emma Corrigan, the narrator, is very blunt when it comes to sharing her thoughts with the reader, which makes the book hilarious.  However, to her friends, colleagues, and family, she is oftentimes not truthful, therefore she has lots of secrets.  She works for Panther Cola, and on the flight back from a (miserably failed) business trip, the plane experiences heavy turbluence.  Emma is so scared that the plane will crash that she blabs all of her secrets to the American stranger sitting next to her.  I found this a little unbelievable, but it was cute, nevertheless.  The reader may connect with some of her secrets, such as Emma lying about her weight to her boyfriend.  When the plane lands safely, she bids him farewell, thinking she will never see him again.  At home, she has to worry about her job, her family, her boyfriend, and her flatmates. <br /> <br />Instinct (and the book jacket description) tells the reader that Emma will definitely see this stranger again, and it turns out he is Jack Harper, the CEO of Panther Cola.  Even though Emma has the \\"perfect boyfriend,\\" she cannot help but fall in love with Jack even though this guy knows all of her secrets.  Jack is a private man who is very taciturn, so the relationship is, for the most part, one-sided.  It is still cute to see them together through their ups and downs in the book, and once again, I must say Emma's thoughts are absolutely hilarious.  She is not 100% honest, so when she says one thing to a person, she lets the reader know what she really is thinking. <br /> <br />A very cute book, one a reader cannot help falling in love with, but the ending is a bit abrupt and could have been written better.  Everything is going along just fine, but something happens.  Then in a couple of pages, it is suddenly resolved.  When the book starts off strong(ly), I believe the book should end strong(ly), so hence the four stars. Regardless, everything else makes it a good \\"chick lit\\" read!
B0001NBMEE|5.0|I watched this movie on TV about 25 years ago and I am just as excited now as I was then. <br /> <br />This is a movie for the whole family to enjoy over and over again. Highly recommended for everybody who likes a bit of \\"old fashion sword-fighting \\" adventure.  <br /> <br />I just LOVE it !!!
B00018D3JQ|3.0|The concept of this album is interesting and quite original in its on way. Two French producers take 13 post punk classics from groups such as XTC, The Clash and The Cure, strip away the original music and replace it with Bossanova rhythms. Then get eight women who have never heard of the songs before to sing them. The result is a classy sounding album and, although this project has a whiff of novelty, it is pulled off perfectly. If you don't believe me listen to their version of Joy Division's `Love will Tear us apart' and you'll be converted. <br />
B00005JLR8|3.0|Jim Sheridan's \\"In America\\" is so imbued with good feelings and good intentions that it comes as a bit of a surprise that the film as a whole turns out to be less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The film, written by Jim, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, tells the story of an Irish immigrant family embarking on a new life in Manhattan.  The family consists of Johnny, a wannabe actor; Sarah, his wife; and their two adorable young daughters, Christy, who narrates the film, and Ariel, a sensitive, wise-beyond-her-years little girl, whose wide-eyed wonderment provides the greatest joy of the film.  (Ariel and Christy are played by real life sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger).  As with most immigrant sagas, the family in \\"In America\\" experiences a great deal of difficulty adjusting to life in a new land.  Complicating matters further is the fact that they recently lost another child, a young boy whose death from a fall down the stairs may or may not have been the result of Johnny's carelessness.  Some of the film's most moving moments involve the ways in which each of the family members deals with the loss, guilt and regret that comes with such a tragedy.<br /><br />The fifth major character is a mysterious recluse who lives in their tenement, a muscular, taciturn black man whose mystical view of life intrigues the ladies in the family while making Johnny eye him with wary, perhaps overprotective, suspicion.  Mateo is deeply embittered about life (we find out why about halfway through the film), yet is instantly softened the moment he meets these two disarming children one Halloween night.<br /><br />There is much to praise in this film.  The Sheridans bring a warm, heartfelt tone to the work, capturing, with both honesty and compassion, the struggles that immigrant families face no matter what their country of origin.  The family members, despite their difficulties and personal problems, obviously love and care for one another deeply and this quality draws us into their tightly knit unit.  Above all, the movie boasts fine performances from Paddy Consadine as Johnny, Samantha Morton as Sarah, Djimon Hounsou as the mysterious neighbor Mateo and, above all, the Bolger sisters who are as compelling and natural on screen as any child actors could ever possibly be.<br /><br />Yet, despite all these quality elements, what is that, nevertheless, keeps us from giving our heart over fully to \\"In America\\"?  I think, at times, the film tries too hard to make its points, often sacrificing grit and believability in a bid to make the audience \\"feel good\\" about life. The film is set in 1982, the year in which \\"'E.T.' - mania\\" was sweeping the nation, and the Sheridans try to infuse some of the magic from that film into their own through the use of both direct and indirect references to Spielberg's masterpiece (at one point the family goes to see the film, and, later, in a crucial scene about filial devotion, Johnny attempts to win Ariel an E.T. doll at a carnival).  However, unlike \\"E.T.,\\" which was an obvious work of fantasy, \\"In America\\" wants to have it both ways: it aspires to be a realistic, earthy portrayal of immigrant life in the Big City, yet it also yearns to be a heartwarming fantasy filled with touches of Magic Realism.  The mixture simply doesn't jell.  Too often the plotting, in an attempt to bring it all together, feels forced, phony and contrived, relying too heavily on implausible parallel events, while piling on the melodrama and tragedy to ludicrous proportions.  The character of Mateo is also problematic.  Despite Hounsou's fine work in the role, Mateo feels like little more than a plot device employed by the filmmakers to get their points across.  He is never allowed to be a fully developed individual in his own right, but instead emerges as the stereotypical \\"exotic black man,\\" replete with all sorts of magical notions and pseudo-spiritual mumbo jumbo.  It is simply a given that Mateo is more noble and enlightened than everybody around him, and the movie ends up patronizing him in the process.<br /><br />Any movie that attempts to combine fantasy with reality has set a difficult task for itself.  That \\"In America\\" doesn't succeed entirely in the endeavor says more about the unevenness of the execution, perhaps, than the worthiness of the cause.  Thus, while one can enjoy the bits and pieces that make up the film, \\"In America\\" itself may leave the audience feeling a bit unsatisfied and frustrated in the long run.

0553583182|4.0|I got this book of Dr Murphy with his other books named \\"Laws of Mind\\" and \\"Miracles of Mind Dynamics\\". Reading the \\"Laws of Mind\\" I thought that I know all these ideas and even the examples. Then I have a look at \\"Miracles of Mind Dynamics\\", again I feel the same. And I recognized that all those ideas were written -about a century ago- in another book series. This book seems wonderful as the other books of Dr Murphy, though even the main idea in this book was outlined a century ago (except some scientific facts). Those books are The Words (I and II), The Letters and The Flashes from Said Nursi. If you like this book, you'll love those, since they give a more wholistic, realistic (not hypothesis) and more lovely approach to life & the meaning.
B00028U6B8|5.0|This is Jefferson Airplane at its peak, political and trippy, at the end of the Sixties. Before their legendary squables would, finally, make them implode, they managed one last great album, and here it is.<br />Each of them seem to have hit their stride, Kantner's writing -which predominates here- has achieved a new maturity, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Cassady play together like one -which is no surprise given that Hot Tuna will be next for both of them- and Slick and Balin sing their hearts out.<br />This is a document -a masterpiece, really- of the Rock being written and played in California at the turn of that decade, while Vietnam raged and Haight Ashbury was beginning to fall apart.  Whether it's the anthemic \\"We Can Be Together\\" or the tender Folk of \\"Good Shepperd,\\" the fierce \\"Volunteers\\" or their evocative rendition of David Crosby's \\"Wooden Ships,\\" this is vintage Airplane.<br />Regarding this reissue's worth, I must say that the remastering has done its job, it enhanced the original rather than destroyed it. As far as the extra tracks are concerned there has been a number of strong opinions about them, prior to my review. If you are on the sentimental side, you are likely to find them a major plus, if you are not, you might still like them or, worse comes to worst, you can program only the ten original album songs.<br />This is music when young people were convinced that their music could make the world a peaceful place. Listen to it ... who knows, you may feel that way too.
B0000062FL|5.0|This is the complete Santana album, you get funky latin licks in songs such as Oye Como Va and Se A Cabo while also darker jazzier songs such as Incident at Neshbur and Singing winds Crying beasts (a nod towards what was to come perhaps?) No song is out of place and it all fits togather wonderfully. For me this is the pinnacle of Santana's career in the recording studio, Santana and Rolie show an almost telepathic understanding of one anothers music with Santana's silky smooth Guitar while Rolie delievers thunder bolts from the Hammond and sings with his soulful voice all backed up with that fiery latin preccusion.        I must however disagree with those (I'm French so what do you expect!!??) who say that the live extra songs are surplus requirements as they demonstrate the buckets of energy that went into Santana's early live performances espcially during the version of Se A Cabo during the precussion solo I   couldn't help but jump up and shout \\"Mais Oui!\\" (if you love those tracks then I strongly recommend the superb Lotus)    Overall I would recommend this above any other Santana album (apart from maybe Lotus)

The book was amazingly frank, colorfully written, and interesting. For all those who think Obama, \\"not Black enough,\\" after reading this, I guarantee you'll have a different opinion! I especially enjoyed the details of his trip to his father's native land, Kenya. It made me want to book the next flight out!

I am already planning on heading to the bookstore tomorrow to grab up his other books!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Possibly the very worst movie to ever generate a major academy award nomination. Lost in Translation is a pointless story about 2 vapid, superficial and humorless Americans wandering around Tokyo like the mall zombies in \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". Do not buy, rent or watch this ridiculous, self-indulgent tripefest....you can thank me later!
B0002TT0NW|3.0|It was a good movie and I fully intend to buy it when it's released, but I have to say that after the first two movies I was blown away by how poorly they followed the book. <br />  My family, who had not read any of the books had no understanding at the end when the stag appeared as Harry's Patronus and I spend most of the end of the movie trying to explain it.  Not many of the fights between Ron and Hermione were in the movie and that is important to future story lines.  Also, there was no introduction of Cedric Diggory who is one of the more important characters in the fourth book. <br />  Probably the most redeeming quality is the graphics.  The Bus and the CGA Buckbeak were worth the price of addmission, but I still wonder how they're going to handle the 4th movie when there is even more to it.

B00005JNEI|5.0|You need to see this  and before say this movie is lies and a waste of your time read this . 9/11 Commission Report Confirms Key Fahrenheit 9/11 Facts <br /> <br />The September 11 Commission's 567-page final report has confirmed key facts presented in Fahrenheit 9/11. These include: <br /> <br />   * Attorney General John Ashcroft told acting FBI director Thomas <br />     Pickard that he did not want to hear anything more about terrorist <br />     threats. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 265 <br /> <br />   * After Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade <br />     Center, he went ahead with his classroom event. After Bush was <br />     informed that the nation was under attack after the second plane <br />     hit, Bush stayed in the classroom for nearly seven more minutes, <br />     continuing to read with the children. Confirmed, Commission Report <br />     at pp. 35, 38-39. <br /> <br />   * Bush failed to have even one meeting to discuss the threat of <br />     terrorism with his head of counterterrorism Richard Clarke. <br />     Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 201. <br /> <br />   * Bush failed to react to the August 6, 2001 security briefing, \\"Bin <br />     Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\\" Confirmed, Commission Report <br />     at pp. 260-262. <br /> <br />   * 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were <br />     allowed to leave the country after September 13. Confirmed, <br />     Commission Report at p. 556, n. 25 [Note that Fahrenheit 9/11 <br />     understates the number of Saudis who left.] <br /> <br />   * Individuals were interviewed by the FBI before being allowed to <br />     leave (although the report confirms that most individuals on these <br />     flights were not interviewed.) Confirmed, Commission Report at p. <br />     557, n. 28. <br /> <br />   * White House former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke approved <br />     these flights. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 329.<br /> <br />It should also be noted that the 9/11 Commission does not address or deem important a number of other issues either addressed in Fahrenheit 9/11 or revealed since completion of the film, including: <br /> <br />   * What exactly was the rush in getting these individuals out of the <br />     country so soon after the worst attack in U.S. history, why did <br />     Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members receive such special <br />     treatment at a time when most Americans still could not get <br />     flights (even though airspace may have been open), and how exactly <br />     were the flights arranged by the U.S. government? <br /> <br />   * Several unanswered questions posed by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) <br />     in a July 20, 2004, Grand Forks Herald column: \\"At a time when 14 <br />     of the 19 terrorists from Sept. 11 were Saudi citizens, how and <br />     why were six secret flights allowed to sneak 142 Saudi citizens <br />     out of the United States in the days after Sept. 11 before they <br />     were properly interrogated? How do we know they weren't properly <br />     questioned? Because Dale Watson, the No. 2 man and former head of <br />     counterterrorism at the FBI has said none of them were subjected <br />     to `serious' interrogation or questions before being allowed to <br />     leave. In fact, we now know that at least two and perhaps more of <br />     the Saudis who were allowed to leave after Sept. 11 were under <br />     investigation by the FBI for alleged terrorist connections.\\" <br /> <br />   * Information that came to light in Dana Milbank's July 22, 2004 <br />     Washington Post article, including the fact that at least one bin <br />     Laden family member who was allowed to leave lived with a nephew <br />     of Osama bin Laden, who \\"was involved in forming the U.S. branch <br />     of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth\\" (WAMY), which the FBI has <br />     described as \\"a suspected terroristorganization,\\" and that the <br />     bin Ladens flew out of the country on the same airplane that \\"has <br />     been chartered frequently by the White House for the press corps <br />     traveling with President Bush.\\" <br /> <br />

B0002IQHY8|2.0|In 1979, I first heard I Robot. That album (at its time was way ahead of itself). I guess you could say it was new electronic. All of APP and AP albums have helped me through hard times in my life. It seemed as though when I was growing Alan Parsons was growing. I have read all of the above rates and I have to say that I am disapointed. I guess I am too old now. If I was young and going to Rave's, then this music might come close to something I was looking for. I get the feeling that Alan's son had a lot to do with this CD. I will buy the next AP CD. However, I am 43 now and my party days are over. I guess Alan needs to key into the new younger crowd. I am saddened by this CD. Too electronic/techno for me....
0345360338|5.0|I was up until 3:00 AM trying to get to the end, but at the same time not wanting the story to be over.  This is such a moving story, made even more so by SKP'S beautiful writing.  Don't miss this one.
0765301598|4.0|The century long war between the human Army of the Jihad and the thinking machine robots of the Synchronized Empire has surprisingly gone very well for the carbon based people.  Machine leader Ominius concludes that if current trends continue the humans will prove victorious as they keep recruiting new members with ease.  Ominus needs a new weapon of mass destruction to change the tide so he introduces pandemic plagues to eradicate the enemy.<br /><br />The virus work extremely well.  The machines feel victory is eminent.  The humans make a last stand at Corrin, but they are not only reeling from the plague infested deaths, they are divided weakening them further.  Jihad leader Varian Atreides claims rival Abulurd Harkonnen acted cowardly; thus both major houses are ready to battle one another at a time when unity is the only hope.  Others have split apart seeking solace in enclaves by forming a sorceress based sisterhood and the Freemen of Dune.  The future looks bleak for mankind.<br /><br />Dune fans will appreciate the final tale in the Legends of Dune trilogy (see THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD and THE MACHINE CRUSADE) that is based on references from Frank Herbert's original 1960s novels.  The story line is relatively fast-paced (at least for a Dune tale), but also contains the typical mythos-religious blending that is a series trademark).  The cast seems two dimensional whether they are human or machine (no Johnny Five is alive amongst this crowd) except perhaps the heated rivalry that adds depth to Varian and Abulurd, but only when they are together in some context.  Still readers will enjoy the final act of survival prequels to the Dune dynasty.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00005JMX6|4.0|If the American Pie movies were a new Millennium reworking of the Porky's films, then The Girl Next Door is Risky Business for the 21st Century. Whereas Risky Business was a reflection of the age of materialism that defined the 1980s, The Girl Next Door also represents its time by blending raunchy humour with romantic idealism. In a canny marketing ploy, Fox has released two versions of The Girl Next Door: the theatrical version and a slightly longer, unrated version with a bit more nudity included.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by the film's director, Luke Greenfield. He wanted to recreate the high school experience for an audience that was of that age or much older. Greenfield does a fine job of analyzing his own movie and explaining the autobiographical elements.<br /><br />Also included is the \\"Trivia Track: Revealing the Girl Next Door\\" with the occasional factoid popping up in the corners of the screen. However, they are mostly statistical in nature (i.e. \\"More than 60% of people believe in love at first sight.\\").<br /><br />The second disc contains the bulk of the supplemental material. First up, is the \\"Scene Specific Commentary by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert.\\" He comments on four scenes while she talks over five.<br /><br />\\"The Eli Experience\\" is a mock-featurette hosted by Christopher Marquette and follows his character (who has now become a porn film mogul) around.<br /><br />\\"A Look Next Door\\" is a pretty standard Making Of featurette that mixes interview soundbites from the cast and crew with behind-the-scenes footage.<br /><br />Another standard feature, the \\"Gag Reel,\\" is included and features lots of blown lines, pratfalls and other hi-jinks that occurred during filming. Mildly amusing.<br /><br />There are also 16 deleted and extended scenes with an optional commentary track by Greenfield.<br /><br />Rounding out the disc is a \\"Stills Gallery\\" with production photos and a couple of trailers for the movie and for two other Fox films.<br /><br />While there are many similarities between The Girl Next Door and Risky Business, the former has much more heart than the latter. There is a sincere sweetness to this movie that Risky Business lacks. Again, this is indicative of the times each film was made in. However, The Girl Next Door is superior in one very significant way: the idealized woman is actually given some depth and dimension and isn't merely a sex object that fuels the man's fantasy as in Risky Business.e and for two other Fox films. <br /> <br />While there are many similarities between The Girl Next Door and Risky Business, the former has much more heart than the latter.

B0002Y69NG|4.0|I would like to thank Warner Bros.(who is well known for making some of the worst dvd releases) for giving the Matrix its proper dues with this amazing ten disc set. Now the two sequels can be appreciated with the animatrix and enter the matrix information available all in one set.

B000268QB2|3.0|I originally gave this Cd only 3 stars but I would now like to add one more star. This Cd grew on me. One night while driving to my boyfriend's house I developed a killer headache. I popped in Keane as it was the only Cd within reach that could be somewhat soothing to my aching head. From that point on, I grew to really like the Cd. Great to sing along to in the car on long trips. Very beautiful music, very soothing and I like the inclusion of the electronic blips on some of the songs. I still feel that some of the songs sound a bit too \\"inspirational\\" or \\"power ballady\\" so if I am stopped in traffic with the windows down I tend to lower the volume on these few songs. I would say give this Cd a chance and it may grow on you as it did me. 9 out of 10 headache sufferers agree!
038572179X|5.0|Having never written a review before, after reading the reviews of people who found this novel 'slow' or the plot 'obvious,' I feel compelled to write.  Fair warning:  If you like 'detective stories,' or grisham-esque novels, you will be bored with this one.   <br /> <br />Instead, this is an incredibly beautiful and sensitive story about conscience and morality and consequence.  McEwan's rendering of human relationships and motives has a subtlety on par with James and Flaubert.  He builds his characters layer upon layer with the deftness and acuity of the master storyteller he is.  This book will be a classic. <br /> <br />That being said, no, this is not a plot-driven novel.  The point of this novel is not to 'guess' the outcome or to hope the author 'tricks' you into buying the suprise ending.  Instead, this novel's strength is in the act of telling.  When you read McEwan's metaphors, for example, you think -- that's how metaphor is supposed to function in a story.  (He so outstrips most modern authors in this regard that it's not even worth comparing). I read this book over a year ago and some of the images still stay with me -- the fountain and the cracked vase on the estate, the pig in France, the planes at war.  His scenes in WW2 are the most powerful war scenes I remember reading anywhere.  Seeing this novel as a story about a girl who tells a lie is like seeing Moby Dick as a book about a whale. <br /> <br />For quality books, like film, the trick is in the telling, not in the cheap thrill of a plot-driven narrative -- for that, they have Cliff Notes.
078681859X|1.0|It's become painfully obvious that the author and his friends are writting all the positive reviews about this series. The fact is, this series is amongst the worst and most sophomoric of modern fantasy writings. DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER BOOK BY JONATHAN STROUD!! If it were possible, I would give this book and the series 0 stars.
0385335482|5.0|This has to be one of the most addicting novels that I've ever read! Becky Bloomwood's adventures are lively, enjoyable and funny! A quite unexpected ending only adds to the wonderfulness of it all. It is full of laughs and crazy situations; crazy situations that readers eventually realize they have been in themselves. Highly recommendable!!
B00000099Y|5.0|this is the greatest album in the world. <br /> <br />Yes, i own the other Tool albums and hundreds of other great albums and i stand by my claim.
B000000H4V|4.0|These were the days.  Sepultura was going strong, and the awful band Soulfly was not even a twinkle in Max Cavalera's eye.  I think this is their best album, no offense to \\"Arise\\" and \\"Roots\\", both great albums as well.  You've gotta love the opening to \\"Refuse/Resist\\" with its tribal metal sound.  This album was definitely a new direction for Sepultura, but I think they were good before and after this album.  If you like Sepultura, get \\"Arise\\", this album, and \\"Roots\\" and call it a day.  The subsequent albums and Max's new group Soulfly are not worth your time or your money.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album, though it lacks the heaviness of the band's other material, is pefect. It captures every emotion and conveys them in musical form. Every song is wonderful (ok...so maybe \\"Closure\\" isn'y great) and the atmospheres are chilling. <br /> <br />Windowpane - 10/10 - Wonderful song with a grear vocal melody and the 2 best guitar solos on the album. <br /> <br />In My Time of Need - 10/10 - The chorus in this song is nothing short of breathtaking. I also like the way Mike sings in the verse. <br /> <br />Death Whispered a Lullaby - 7.5/10 - cool lyrics. Nice chorus. Not as good as some of the other songs, but still good. <br /> <br />Closure - 6.5/10 - The album's weak point, though that still puts it at pretty high standards with all other music. <br /> <br />Hope Leaves - 11/10 - I almost cried the first time i listened to this song. It is absolutely beautiful and sad. The short guitar solos chill you to the bone and the chorus leaves you in awe. <br /> <br />To Rid the Disease - 9/10 - A different sounding song. A little darker sounding. The highlight of this song is the chorus, though, which is where the song changes key. The guitar solo is great, too. <br /> <br />Ending Credits - 10/10 - a very short instrumental, but one of the most creative and greatest melodies ive ever heard. <br /> <br />Weakness - 8/10 - Not much of a song, but still leaves you with a  weird feeling
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is by far one of the top five metal records ever, and arguably the greatest.  There is so much intensity on this record and it is all packed into 28 minutes worth of music.  That is, of course, my only gripe.  I wish this album was a little longer.    This is Slayer at the peak of their career.  Kerry and Jeff's dueling guitars on this record are awe inspiring and have never been equaled.  Tom's vocals hit ranges that he probably is not capable of today.  Finally, Dave's furious drum attack tops off a musically superb metal recording.  For my money's worth, it doesn't get much better than \\"Angel of Death\\" and \\"Raining Blood\\".  This is the cornerstone album of any metal collection.    Look for Slayer's new \\"Reign in Blood\\" DVD, which is just a live version of this album straight through!

0385510438|5.0|The writing by Grisham on The Last Juror I thought were some of his best writing since it took him 15 years to write The Last Juror. So I am happy to say that The Last Juror is a must for any Grisham fan. The Last Juror is not about a young hot-shot lawyer or any lawyers at all, instead it takes place in the 70's in Ford County Mississippi where A Time To Kill took place, but now a murder is committed by a local named Danny Padgett; troublemaker, and who's family is known for drug running, and other petty crime. So now as the case goes to trial, a young man named Wileyw who buys the Ford County Times, then covers the case as Danny is tried for murder of Rhonda where she met Danny at a local club on the state line, but gave him the cold shoulder because she would not accept his dance. So he killed her. Now Danny got life, but in the 70's, life does not mean life, it just means eight years. So now as Wiley gets used to the Southern life, and with the meetings of three Vietnam vetrans who love to play poker but Wiley always loses when he plays them. Then once Danny gets out of prison for parole, three murders happen to three juror's from the Danny trial just eight years ago. Now the finger is pointed at Danny. The last 50 pages are the best Grisham has ever written, this book is well written, it is slow at first, but the suspense builds with every page that is read. This is a great book, and not to be missed.
0553293397|5.0|While \\"The Caves of Steel\\" gets my vote as \\"The Best Asimov Book of All-Time\\", this one comes in a close second place.  I sure would have liked for Asimov to expand a bit more on the world from \\"The Caves of Steel\\", but he does a great job here as well, in presenting the different culture found on the Spacer world... someone HAS to make a movie out of the Robot Murder books.
B000000H4V|1.0|If you been a fan of sep's first albums examples ? \\"morbidvisions/bestial devestation? , \\" schizophrenia\\" , \\"beneath the remains \\" and the epic \\"arise\\" then don't even bother with chaos a.d by any chance because this was the album where sep changed their thrash roots and began playing  hardrock then slowly changing into nu-metal which ruined their career. I used to love sep and every song these guys've made i realy cherish it and i was very happy with their albums...That was untill i heard chaos a.d. and after roots bloody roots,roots,against, nation, roar back etc. Realy dissapointing effort from a band that was once a thrash masterpiece.First problem with chaos ad was the sound change and max's vocals sounded like crap also the bass guitars sounded as if they were broke or something. The drums ? Weak. When i first heard this i even thought maiby they put the wrong cd in the case but nope its sep except with a new sound. Not recommended!
B00007ELEL|3.0|Two young brothers from cold Minnesota must have had a rich fantasy life in the midst of mid-western snowstorms.  Their Fargo was a sly satire of prairie folks.  But before there were Fargo and Academy Awards, there was The Big Lebowski, which for actor Jeff Bridges is his signature career role, The Dude.    The plot is a LA, Raymond Chandler style mystery; it's hard to tell the bad guys and femme fatales without a scorecard.    The similarities stop there.  Dude is a middle aged longhaired, hippy slacker with a bowling ball. His pal John Goodman is a Vietnam freak-out converted to Judaism.  Together they meet the Fritz brothers, the nympho-artist, and assorted freaks on the way to solving a mystery that really doesn't matter.  This one is for laughs.

It was through this gateway introdution to rock and roll that I was able to later find bands like Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, the Beatles...all the classic bands and acts. And it was Significant Other that made me want to play music in a band.  <br /> <br />It seems like it always takes the most popular rock act at any era to draw a new kid into more specific genres of the music. Think KISS, Led Zeppelin, Motley Crue or Pearl Jam--these were all top sellers at one time and were the first band for a lot of 13-year-olds who would go on to delve deep into musical addiction. Well, Limp Bizkit was my band and Significant Other was the record. <br /> <br />I can't explain what I heard or why it compelled me the way it did in 7th grade-all I know is that I didn't leave home without Significant Other in my busted Sony Discman for about 2 years. Ask anyone who was fortunate enough to ride my schoolbus back in those days-I was that kid with the headphones rockin' out at 7 in the morning. Fred Durst was and is an icon to me, and it was his angst that drew me in. Borland's riffs were CHUNKY and FLESHED OUT, Rivers' bass work was spot-on and Otto had that perfect hip-hop/rock n roll fusion sound in his drumming that kept me coming back for more. Lethal's turntable work added an element of flavor that any rock act could have used. The production is crystal clear. I won't go through every track because I love them all and that is that. Among my friends and I this is one of THE classics, and no matter how much the band continues to change to this day, NOBODY can EVER take this groundbreaking effort away from them.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|\\"Cold Mountain\\" tells the story of two would-be lovers (Law and Kidman)  who on the eve of their relationship blossoming into a full blown love affair are separated for years by The Civil War.  Many viewers find immediate problems with this premise, as the two are more in love with the potential and promise of a relationship than the actual person to whom they swore devotion.  The problem comes from the years that pass and the burdens both must overcome to remain true to the other.  Many people just don't buy it, assuming  the two would have moved past thoughts of the other sometime during their years apart.   <br /> <br />The majority of the film deals with the Law's long, Homeric return from his battles intercut with visions of Kidman's life, full of isolation and toil (until she is joined by a live-off-the-land savior played by Renee Zellwegger).  The educated and cultured Kidman soon trades her life of pianos and novels for one of scarecrows and winter gardens.   <br /> <br />Law's trip home, through the foothills of the Appalachians, is at the same time picturesque and bitterly painful.  As a deserter, he must avoid most of society and thus survives on a scavenger's diet of what he can find or catch.  He encounters many eccentric figures found among the war-torn South.  Despite what the Oscar nominations will tell you (Law and Zellwenger), the real acting is done by these tangential characters in minor roles (especially Phillip Hoffman as a preacher fleeing from his sins and Natalie Portman as a new bride whose husband will never return from the war). <br /> <br />\\"Cold Mountain\\" obviously fixes its cannon directly on war, pointing out all the lives destroyed among the citizens of the South.  As we saw with Gangs of New York, this film also muddies the water on the morality of the Civil War, showing us both evil deeds and righteous acts by the North and South alike.    It is not as simple as saying \\"the Union was right and the Confederates were wrong\\".      Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) gives viewers another film set directly in the middle of a great war that focuses not on the events of that war, but rather on the lives of people affected by the turmoil around them.  A powerful piece of historical fiction.
6305546789|3.0|Halloween left no impression on me. Don't get me wrong, this is called a classic for many good reasons (the mysterious aura surrounding the escaped psychopath Michael Myers, the fantastic musical score that should've been used more sparingly) but the boring, long-winded 70s cinematography wore on me. The plot in itself is scary enough, and the opening killing is chilling, but a lot of the movie seems predictable and practical. For all the horror buffs who regard this is a masterpiece and think I'm an idiot, I'm sorry...as I write this I am 17 and accustomed to films that move more quickly and dialogue that is more compelling. I am assured that Halloween is as good as it could be having been being released in 1978- films are written so much better today in terms of keeping the short attention span of the audience (me). I'd reccommend renting this.
1400032717|5.0|I normally am not one to \\"review\\" items, but this book is absolutely fabulous, and I needed to counterbalance any non-5 star reviews.  Having worked a lot with Autistic children, this book is absolutely accurate and incredible. The last time I read a book on my own (as in, not as an assignment) was back when the Berenstein Bears were big, and this book, I just cannot put down.  There was one review that faulted the main character for not having enough of a personality - I am not saying that kids with Autism do not have personalities, because their personalities often far surpass those of \\"neurotypical\\" people, but the main character's dialogue and thoughts are just so accurately portrayed.  This is a wonderful, fast read, recommended to all.
B00005JMX6|4.0|This movie was sad in a good way......i know its supposed to be a comedy but after watching this movie it left me with a bitter-sweet feeling kinda like you didnt want it to end..it was a good movie it was sometimes corny but i liked it i liked how Matthew fell in love with the girl next door
1400032717|3.0|I picked up the book after reading so many reviews here at Amazon from avid readers who just rave about the book. What a surprise.  I find the lack of ANY emotion from the main character irritating, i felt so sorry for everyone around him, from his mother to his father, but not for Christopher.  Overall an ok book, i liked the puzzles and the mathematical riddles, is it one of the best books i have ever read?  Far from it.

B00005Y228|2.0|Australian actress Kylie Minogue hit it big in 1988 with her cover of \\"Loco-motion\\" and, although she released several more albums in Australia and Europe, she never had the same amount of fame as she'd had from that one hit song. In 2002, Kylie finally broke into the American music scene with her album \\"Fever\\" which was full of many dance-pop songs that, unfortunately had little to distinguish one from the other. Having never really been a fan of Kylie's singles, I found her album online one day and decided that I might as well give it a chance. The way people were going on about it, I thought I would find something groundbreaking but sadly this wasn't so. Maybe it's only because I'm not a fan of this kind of music but I found much of the album to be too similar.    The album begins with the highly irritating and repetitive \\"More, More, More\\". The beat to this song is great, I'll give you that, but the lyrics are far too repetitive, even for a dance song. Kylie's voice (which, to be fair, I am not a large fan of anyway) seems to be all over the place. It seems to randomly change from kittenish singing to breathy whispers. \\"Love At First Sight\\" follows and has somewhat better lyrics. This is more of what I was expecting from Kylie. While I'm still not convinced that she is a good vocalist, this song is catchy enough and has a good enough beat that it does matter. My only (minor) complaint about this song is that it seems to drag on too long which makes it more repetitive than it needs to be.     The hit single \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" comes next and it really lives up to its name. Unfortunately, it is not that great a song to begin with. Kylie voice sounds great but the lyrics are repeated far too much and the \\"la la la...etc.\\" part is just annoying. It is a decent dance song and probably Kylie's best vocal performance on the album however the song gets old fast. The title track, \\"Fever\\" comes next and seems to be describing love as a kind of fever. The beat seems like a slowed down version of the previous tracks and this song really doesn't stand out. Also, the lyrics really don't make sense. (\\"I'm dancing on the ceiling\\") \\"Give It To Me\\" comes after that and isn't any better. The lyrics are extremely simple and while this works for some artists (namely India Arie) it does not work here. The beat is too computerized for my taste and it is very difficult to understand what Kylie is saying because of the digital effects in the background and she seems to be shouting the chorus just to be heard.    Judging by the title of the next track, \\"Fragile\\", one would except a change of pace but no such luck. The song has a somewhat slower beat but it is still a dance song and that doesn't really fit with the lyrics, which aren't too great to begin with. (\\"But I get butterflies, water in my eyes\\") and the song also seems to drag far too long. \\"Come Into My World\\" is up next and, while it seems like a carbon copy of \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" it is not quite as irritating. It is still difficult to hear what Kylie is saying however this song is somewhat more enjoyable then others on the album. Another single, entitled \\"In Your Eyes\\" comes after and is more what I expected from Kylie: an enjoyable dance track with decent vocals. Unfortunately, by this point it is not enough to make up for the other lackluster material on the album.     \\"Dancefloor\\" is up next and is a fairly typical song with subpar lyrics and average vocals over a decent dance beat. This song is only slightly better than some of the others but it really doesn't stand out as many of the songs have similar beats and all kind of blend together. \\"Love Affair\\" sounds virtually identical to many of the other songs and at this point in the album I've given up hope that Kylie will give us some meaningful lyrics over dance beats (like Jewel's \\"Stand\\") and very few of the songs have variations in vocal or musical styles. \\"Your Love\\" is a perfect example of this. While the background music is somewhat different, it, like in all of the other songs, is overwhelmed by the pounding beat which makes all the songs sound like one big song that changes lyrics after a few minutes. \\"Burning Up\\" has a title that fits with the album name (\\"Fever\\") but that's where the appeal of this song ends. Just when Kylie seems to be changing pace (in the beginning and verses of this song), she hits us with yet another upbeat dance song. I realize this is a dance album but a little variety would be nice. Lastly, we come to two bonus tracks entitled \\"Boy\\" and \\"Butterfly\\" which really do not stand out among all of the other similar tracks.    Overall Mark: 2/5    Maybe it is only because this is not my usual style of music but I found that I did not enjoy much of this album. Contrary to popular belief, dance music should at least have decent lyrics (as with Jewel's \\"Stand\\" and \\"Intuition\\"), decent vocals (as Soluna's \\"Hey Hey You You\\" and \\"Bring It To Me\\" have) or in some rare cases, both of the above (see Sharyn Maceren's album \\"Always Dreamin'\\"). Kylie has an average-at-best voice however she settles for giving us songs that all sound like carbon copies of each other (especially because of the virtually identical beats). Most Kylie fans will probably vote negatively on this but hopefully some people will be able to see that, despite this album's quality for dance clubs, it is not good for much else.

0345350499|5.0|Quick Review Summary: <br /> <br />If you like fantasy, the Arthurian Legend, the Celtic Religions, and/or Modern Paganism, READ THIS BOOK. <br /> <br /> <br />The Full Review: <br /> <br />I came into this book very interested in the Arthurian legend.  I knew the very bare basics, but nothing deep of the actual legend.  This quickly, quickly changed. <br /> <br />The book tells of the Arthurian legend as told by Morgan Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, and Guinivere.  It shows the path as Arthur, the Pendragon, the Sacred King, begins at childhood and becomes then the Chosen King of the People and Avalon both. <br /> <br />But you say \\"So why not read L'Morte de Arthur or something?\\" <br /> <br />Because of the way that this book is told.  This book has deep interaction between the Old Religion and the newcoming Christians.  It tells also of Arthur's betrayal, and also conflicts between even Avalon. <br /> <br />I consider this book tied with LotR as one of the most interesting and well-done books I have ever read. <br /> <br />I came into the book deeply interested in the Celts and Paganism.  I left extremely happy.
1570426457|4.0|FROM THE BACK/CASE: \\"An activist attorney is killed in a cute little L.A. Trolley called Angels Flight, far from Harry Bosch's Hollywood turf. But the case is so explosive - and the dead man's enemies inside the L.A.P.D. are so numerous - that it all falls to Harry to solve it. Now the streets are superheating. Harry's year-old Vegas marriage is unraveling. And the hunt for a killer is leading Harry to another high-profile L.A. murder case, one where every cop had a motive. The question is, did any have the guts?\\" <br /> <br />It's post Rodney King and every thing that the L.A.P.D. does is constantly being scrutinized. Now, a Civil Rights attorney who is preparing to sue the L.A.P.D. and several of its officers is murdered. This leads to Detective Harry Bosch and his team being called out in the middle of the night. It doesn't take them long after they arrive on the scene to determine that they are being put in charge of a political keg of TNT that could blow up right in their faces if they aren't careful. During the investigation Harry discovers that the attorney had enough evidence to win the case. Did a cop kill the attorney? Did a civilian commit the murder? These are the questions that Harry, his team and you need to find. <br /> <br />Mr. Connelly wrote this in such a manner that picking the killer early was easy; however, he left enough doubt to keep you guessing. With the plot twists, he does a great job at making you wonder if your choice is correct. <br /> <br />This is the first book my Michael Connelly that I have had the pleasure to experience. Being one who commutes in a high traffic area and gets very tired of morning DJ's, I chose the abridged audio version of this book. This version was narrated by Burt Reynolds who did a good job with most of the male characters. Unfortunately, when he would do the voices of the female characters I would get this vision of him in drag which distracted some from the book but not enough to make you lose interest. Another thing I didn't like is the back of the case stated that Harry's Vegas marriage is unraveling but his wife is never mentioned in the book nor is she ever at home regardless of the time of day or night. I understand that this is just one of the Harry Bosch novels, but if this isn't part of this particular story line, it shouldn't have been included in the description of the book. <br /> <br />One of the things I liked about this novel is the way that Mr. Connelly painted the character of Harry and Mr. Reynolds brought him to life. He was painted as a hard core detective who really detested the L.A.P.D. bureaucratic stuff (if you know what I mean). <br /> <br />When I was determining if I wanted to give this book a try, I noticed that it has been listed as everything from mystery to suspense to thriller. Personally if you are a fan of the hard core detective genre, then you're going to like Angels Flight. <br /> <br />Published in 1999 this book has never been nominated for any awards. Though I liked this book and rated it four stars, I agree that it isn't award nomination material. <br /> <br />Though Angels Flight has never been nominated for an award, I am including a list of some of Mr. Connelly's accomplishments for your information. <br /> <br />AWARDS:  <br /> <br />NOMINATED: <br /> <br />(3) Anthony Award   1993, 1994, 1996  <br />(2) Edgar Allan Poe Award  1999, 2003 <br /> <br />WON: <br /> <br />(3) Anthony Award   1997, 1999, 2003 <br />(1) Edgar Allan Poe Award  1993 <br /> <br />Angels Flight is an above average novel that takes place in L.A. with everything the cops do being scrutinized. This leads to some very delicate situations when Harry is assigned to investigate the death of a black Civil Rights attorney. Like I stated earlier, if you like Mystery/Suspense or Hard Core Detective novels, then read or listen to Angels Flight. It is a smooth flowing novel with some twists and turns to keep you guessing if your assumptions are right. <br /> <br />Being the first novel by Michael Connelly that I have experienced I can't recommend any specific titles that I have read. I can recommend his award winning titles which include, The Black Echo, Bloodwork, City of Bones and The Poet. <br /> <br />If you enjoy the works of authors such as James Lee Burke and Lawrence Block, then you will enjoy the works of Michael Connelly, or at least, Angels Flight. <br />
1594200106|5.0|This book starts a little slow but as soon as you get to the main story it becomes a web of intricate deception and lies.  The book is taking place in Barcelona, the mistery of a writter that has suddenly dissapeared and a young fan is trying to find what happned to this writer during the Spanish civil war.  I bough this book in Spain and read the original version in Spanish, now I am reading the English version and it is just as good. Recomended to every avid reader.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|I don't recommend this movie to anyone who gets disturbed by serious violence, child pornography and abuse towards animals.  We had to turn it off without even finishing it because of some of the scenes.  If you are bothered by any of these things and the fact that this movie implies that these things occur, do not rent or buy it.  These kind of scenes may not bother some people, but it was very disturbing to us.  My review is not even about the actors... just the content and story line.  It wasn't at all what we expected.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|If u got the her debut songs in a minor, then you defintely have to rush and get this one. Diary is way better than songs in a minor. This Cd will go down in history as one of the best R&B/soul record. Enough said
B000003S09|5.0|To call In the Court of the Crimson King the earliest prog rock album is of course debatable, it all depends how much you consider bands like Pink Floyd, Procol Harum, the Nice, and the Moody Blues progressive rock. But regardless, this album was hugely influential in the world of progressive rock. This is the original King Crimson, with Robert Fripp, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald, and Peter Giles (and Pete Sinfield added on as an extra member, even if he only handled the lyrics). Fripp, Michael Giles and his brother Peter Giles was with a trio called Giles, Giles & Fripp and released the album The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles & Fripp in 1968 on Deram. Supposed to to be a rather whimsical album with its share of humor that might not appeal to everyone. So obviously Robert Fripp wanted to have much higher ambitions and King Crimson was the answer. Of course the band wasn't exactly known for stable lineups, and Greg Lake would end up ELP, and Ian McDonald would find himself with the multi-platinum selling AOR act Foreigner, in which King Crimson would quickly find themselves as Robert Fripp and whoever he could find at the time. On with the review of In the Court of the Crimson King. The opening song, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\". This is a rather aggressive jazzy number dominated by McDonald's wind instruments and Greg Lake's uncharacteristically harsh voice. It was interesting to note some novelty band called the Roto Rooter Good Time Christmas Band gave that song the Lawrence Welk treatment and made it in to a polka version (pretty hilarious if you ever heard it). As for the original, this song proves how much music progressed from the pop-psychedelia of two years previous (1967) with stuff like the Lemon Pipers' \\"Green Tambourine\\" and the Strawberry Alarm Clock's \\"Incense and Peppermints\\". No flower power stuff here, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is obviously prog rock on the heavy and aggressive side. This song obviously had a big influence on bands like Van der Graaf Generator, or certain Italian bands like Osanna (PFM was known to do a cover of this song live). Then you have the much more mellow \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" dominated by McDonald's clarinets. This then segues in to the Mellotron epic \\"Epitaph\\". It's a very dramatic piece indeed, with acoustic guitars and clarinets as well. \\"Moonchild\\" is the most controversial piece on the album, often written off as boring. The first part is actually quite pleasant, a nice mellow piece with Mellotron and Greg Lake, but then it all turns in to noodling with a vibraphone and some electric guitar from Fripp in the background. After a few listens I got to think it was pleasant. Then the final cut is the wonderful title track. This one reminds me most of the Moody Blues, especially because of the Mellotron and similar vocal arrangements. Of course the Moody Blues would never do any music this heavy, and as lengthy of music they would do would be \\"Legend of a Mind\\" (aka \\"Timothy Leary's Dead\\"). Plus of course, you could never imagine the Moodies doing something like \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\". It's always a trip to hear Greg Lake's voice backed by Mellotron, because Lake's next band, ELP, never used the instrument (apparently Keith Emerson was no fan of the instrument, and obviously preferred the Hammond organ and Moogs). With perhaps the second half of \\"Moonchild\\", this is a wonderful and historic album to have in your collection.
B000003TA4|1.0|The Public couldn't take anymore bands like Firehouse, Poison, or Warrant and who could blame them. It was a good 15 or 16 years of that sort of music and it was getting old. When Nirvana put this cd out, it was a whole new ball game. It was so different than anything before it. It was also about the worst record to receive this kind of noterity. Every song, compleat garbage. No tuning, no singing, no song? Smells Like Teen Spirit? Not even good titles! The strange part was that there were so many bands that were out at the same time and were all better (soundgarden, Alice in Chains ect.) There will be bands like this again, when ever the public is in need of a change. Just hope the next can learn to play first.
0064407667|4.0|The book I am reviewing is The Bad Beginning. It is written by Lemony Snicket. It is the first book in the series called A Series of Unfortunate Events.I liked this book because it was interesting and funny. It doesn't sound good if you only read the first page but if you read into the story you really find it interesting.I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't ddecide to read a book by its first page or cover. If you like the first book then you should keep reading all the way up to the tenth book and so on. I am on the fourth book right now. lemony Snicket is a great author.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I have to admit.. i never liked screaming and when i heard avenged i was turned off by their intensity.  But after a couple listens i started to fall in love with this band... the guitar riffs mixed with the singing is incredible.  The cd is like one big epic song.. with a couple songs going together like the beginning of Eternal Rest being an insane solo... these guys are one of if not my favorite band.  This album is harder and the singing/screaming is much better than City of Evil.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is not something you simply listen to.  It is truly an experience.  It hits heights that few other albums can match.  Each track is an exploration of yourself, so deeply thought provoking.  Whther its the driving rhythms of 'The Grudge' and 'Ticks and Leeches', or the sublime beauty of the 'Disposition, Reflection, Triad' epic, this album keeps you enthralled.  The unorthodox drumming of Danny Carey leads the way, his playing like that of a man with 10 arms.  His beats are so complex that I dare any drummer to attempt them.  Justin Chancellor's driving basslines combined with Adam Jones' unique lead guitar stylings give the music life.  The two intertwine to make a beautiful amalgamation of sounds.  The true star of the show however, is Maynard James Keenan's angelic voice and thought provoking lyrics.  He can inspire sorrow, happiness, and rage all with the tone of his unique and gorgeous vocals.  This is all in all the greatest progressive rock album ever, and arguably the greatest pure album ever.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I knew the story already, and I have seen probably all the classic \\"passion\\" movies. The only thing different is more graphic(really graphic)violence.I know Jesus suffered horribly. What is the point? I don't need to see him whipped to a bloody pulp with grisly implements.With Mel Gibson's heavy handed direction, it was like watching a senseless slasher movie. After a while you just go numb.This film is nothing new.The story has been told before, and with much more finesse.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I enjoyed the first movie even with all of its unrealistic fighting scenes but after it I had tons of questions and could not wait for the second movie to come out.  This DVD has answered most of the questions from the first movie.   <br /> <br />There are not as many fight scenes and the movie is not as gory as the first one but there is still some gore and violence making this movie inappropriate for family viewing.  The Bride character is developed alot more and we see alot more of what she was all about before the wedding. <br /> <br />I will agree with some that this is not the greatest movie ever done but I enjoyed it anyway.  I feel like there is closure to the first movie and I am satisfied with the answers Quentin Tarantino gave to my questions.  I now know why Bill shot the Bride, what she was doing in that Texas chapel.  I also know what happens to most of the characters from the first movie. Like I said closure on the story. <br /> <br />I only gave this 4 stars because as I said, it was not the greatest movie and the history of the Bride character could have been explored alot further.  I guess Tarantino only had so much time to do this though. <br />
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This is one of the best boxed sets I have ever seen. WB really went all out to make the best set they could and really pay due to this classic series of movies.

The last three discs are different featureets on the making of the trilogy. This is an amazing set and a must for matrix fans. Like the \\"Alien: Quadrilogy\\" I was hoping for a regular version and a director's cut for each film but I guess I should be happy with this. This is a must have set. <br /> <br />\\"The Matrix\\" (1999) <br />\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" (2003) <br />\\"The Mtrix Revolutions\\" (2003)

B0002TT0NM|4.0|In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was not the best effort in the HP series but it was pretty close. I liked how the director stringed the whole story together. Unlike the chamber of secret this movie flowed much better. at the same time this movie had certain problems of not conforming with the story word to word. I praise the director for his ability to represent a set idea in a different way, I repremend him on presenting it too differently. So, in conclusion, I must say that I liked the movie slightly more than moderately.
B00000099Y|5.0|Though I agree that the musical quality of this album is phenominal and actually inspired me to pick up the bass, it must be said that this is not just some hard-rocking, head-banging orgy of instruments.  Everytime I listen to this album I pick up something new.  It is something of an aural illustration of Jungian theory, traveling from the ego through the shadow, toying with the anima, and finally discovering the self.  This is intellectual poetry juxtaposed with riveting riffs, unforgetable tonality, and extraordinarily intricate drumwork.  Aenima leaves nothing to be desired save a few reference books on the unconscious mind and a heavy discussion on choosing to accept what's found in the shadow.
1400032717|5.0|Right out of the gate, this mystery is unique with the murder in the story being that of the hero's neighbor's dog.<br /><br />Christopher Boone, an autistic British teenager is the hero of the story who quite logically describes the way he sees the world through mathematics, systems, and structures rather than emotion and feelings.  In fact, Christopher is unable to process or handle emotions, but he is a three-dimensional character in spite of this, able to operate in the world and describe it quite beautifully and sometimes humorously.  This is definitely a character-driven story and one easily follows Christopher as he tracks down the killer of his neighbor's dog.  I loved the quotes and stories mentioned throughout the novel.  What's best about this story is that it starts as an off-beat mystery, but ends as so much more.<br /><br />That being said, I didn't particularly like the ending, but when 4/5 of the book is so original and startling, it's worth the trip, even if the end is perfunctory and open-ended.
1573225517|5.0|On a whim recently, I decided to give HIGH FIDELITY, Nick Hornby's first novel, a try. As far as readability is concerned, it is nothing too difficult: Hornby is no Henry Miller when it comes to confessional writing, and never finds the need to indulge in some kind of flighty poetic style, even when his main character, Rob Fleming, is feeling his most depressed. Hornby's strength comes more from observation, characterization and an acute ear for dialogue than anything else; all of his strengths come together to make HIGH FIDELITY an often stimulating and entertaining read. It's not a book with grand themes or lofty pretensions: it's simply a story about a self-absorbed manchild who is trying to deal with the painfulness of a breakup in his own distinctive way. The author's honesty about love is its strength; so is Hornby's sharp characterization of the main character. Rob Fleming, the former DJ who is now running a failing record store, may not be the most likable main character in all of literature, but in Hornby's hands he is always a fully realized and mostly intriguing character (even if his self-pitying does occasionally become irritating). Hornby's insights into the highs and lows of relationships are almost always fascinating (especially for me, since I have yet to truly experience the kinds of feeling Rob feels in the novel); the result is a novel that is entirely fresh and wonderfully observant. Heck, music fans might get a kick out of it too, what with all the music references peppered into the narrative. HIGH FIDELITY comes highly recommended by me; Stephen Frears' film adaptation is pretty good too.
0156027321|4.0|A friend, who spoke very highly of it, recommended this book to me. <br />Set in the backdrop of a small town and its zoo keeping family, the book starts in a leisurely fashion. This sets the background for the second part, which takes over 227 days on a lifeboat. The narration keeps you riveted to the events. To me the story is about the struggles of someone alone on a lifeboat. It is about the survival instincts of man, basically an animal, which kicks in. It is about the imaginations of a 16-yr boy. It is about the creativity of a boy, drawing on his experiences from his 16 years, to stay alive. <br />I was riveted to the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, till I got to the end. In just a couple of pages, a whole new element is introduced which confused me and threw me in a loop. In retrospect, those pages give the book a whole new meaning and stuff to keep you thinking for a long time. <br />My recommendation: just read it as a book and not as a `Man Booker Prize' winner. You will enjoy it more that way. Have fun!
B00003CX96|4.0|I have a particular affinity for this film, as it is set in the town where I currently live, Bloomington, Indiana.  Most people in Bloomington are basketball crazy; apart from this, perhaps the second most popular sport is bicycling, culminating at the end of the school year with the Little 500 bicycle race on campus (a bicycle version of the internationally-known Indianapolis 500 motor race, just 50 miles north).  This is primary a campus event, with fraternities and a few other organisations fielding teams; there are also community teams, and always at least one team with the name 'cutter'.<br /><br />The film is a piece of fiction not just in its plot but also in the details, but it is a good story.  The primary character is Dave Stoller (played by Dennis Christoper), a recent high school graduate who isn't sure what to do with the rest of his life.  He and his three friends Mike (a very young Dennis Quaid), Cyril (Daniel Stern) and Moocher (Jackie Earle Haley) had made a high school pact to 'waste their lives together' hanging out in the comfortable, small-town atmosphere of Bloomington.  However, half the town is university, with all the ambitious, young people that such institutions bring.  Dave is son of Raymond (Paul Dooley) and Evelyn (Barbara Barrie), a typical middle class working couple.  Raymond makes his living as a used-car salesman, largely taking advantage of the supposedly-smarter college kids.  Barbara is trying to put some romance back into their lives.<br /><br />In his boredom, Dave becomes obsessed with two things - Italian culture and bicycle racing.  He calls his father and mother 'papa' and 'mama', plays Italian opera (Caruso, etc.) endlessly, persuades his mother to add Italian cuisine to the home cooking; Dave's friends put up with him, as they have their own small struggles to deal with - Mike, in entering a stage in life where he's no longer the star quarterback of the school; Cyril, who can only think of the next way to disappoint his father (who delights in being understanding); and Moocher, unemployed and unambitious, but falling in love and planning to get married.  The spend their time in a sort of dazed and confused state, without too much confusion due to lack of stimulation.<br /><br />Dave realises there is more to life than hanging out on the downtown square in Bloomington.  He begins impersonating an Italian exchange student, falls for a co-ed named Katherine (played by Robyn Douglass), and the juxtaposition of town and gown is set - Katherine is the girlfriend of a swim-team member, and Dave with his three friends have a confrontation with them on campus that leads the president of the university to step in, marking as the field of combat the hallowed bicycle race, the Little 500.<br /><br />Dave, in his drive to be the Italian exchange student, has taken to idolising the soon-to-be-visiting Italian bicycle team of Cinzano, and become a great cyclist himself.  Disappointed by the poor sportsmanship of that race, Dave is ready to give up racing, until his father Raymond, who had always been against his son's starry-eyed ambitions, sees the spark go out of Dave's life, and encourages him to join his friends in the newly-formed Cutter team, and run the race at the college.<br /><br />The word 'cutter' is a derogatory term the college kids used to describe the townsfolk.  Bloomington is situated in the midst of a huge natural deposit of limestone, some of which has been used in construction of buildings all over the world, including bridges in London, the Empire State Building, and massive public works projects in Asia.  The college kids (the 'gown') look down on the cutters (the 'town'), and are intent on not letting them steal the victory in the race.  The epic battle is set.<br /><br />There were cameos in the film, including the then -actual president of the university, John Ryan.  Extras for town and college scenes were hired from Bloomington, a few of whom I know and enjoy seeing again in their 25-year-old glory (one such person, Jennifer Mikel, sang at the wedding of a friend not too long ago).  Those of us who know the geography of Bloomington watch the film and delight in editing that causes geographic problems - turning the corner on a bicycle and going down a street that is not connected to the one before; riding or driving down streets the wrong way on one-way streets.  Most especially, we delight in seeing the town and university as it was.  Much has changed in the 25 years since this film was made, and yet, much is the same.<br /><br />The term 'cutter' didn't really come into use until this film - it was more or less invented for the story in this film.  As Dave's father Raymond tells Dave at one point, Dave is not a cutter.  Raymond was a cutter - he cut limetone in the quarries, but those days are gone.  The campus is built of limestone, and it is time now for Dave take advantage of those buildings.<br /><br />In the end, the hero does not get the girl, but does get a life, in a victory that goes beyond what any race could bring.  (Dave wins one bicycle race in the film, and loses another; you'll have to see it for yourself to find out how this plays out).<br /><br />The film stands the test of time fairly well - the comedy and the drama still rings true.y seeing again in their 25-year-old glory (one such person, Jennifer Mikel, sang at the wedding of a friend not too long ago).

B00004TRD8|3.0|Terminator 2 - almost certainly the most violent film I have ever viewed in my entire life. The ever thickening plot, surrounding a vision that robots from the future will, one day, rule the world, and lead mankind into a deathly destruction, features the T2000 robot prototype, who is brought to this Earth to save the innocent humans on the planet. This film is sentimental, in some parts, as the T2000 has absolutely no sense of conscience, love or compassion. Therefore, he will kill whenever he thinks that something is wrong. Moreover, the child who is being protected by this ultrahuman - a yob, and a criminal youth at that - is made somewhat kinder, as the film progresses, as it is only his responsibility to teach the learning robot humanity. This film is definitely violent, with scenes of death, violence and murder enraging the viewer with fright and deep worry, though it is usually the 'good' characters who get the better of the camera, as is conventional with all violent films like this. I believe that this movie is somewhat a little too violent, though the sentimentality included in the way the younger characters teach humanity and manners is a lesson for us all: only use violence in absolute desperation. A good film, though a tad verging on horror, when it comes to violence.

B00000IHE3|4.0|It's not their best, but still worth getting.  I'd suggest getting this one before Love Over Gold or Making Movies (their two best ones), otherwise Communique will seem like a letdown.  Portobello Belle is very nice.
1594200106|3.0|In reviews, The Shadow of the Wind was described as a Gothic Novel.  This intrigued me because the Gothic Novel is such an Anglo American creation.  Fog enveloped castles, maidens in distress and werewolves come to mind.  I had never heard of a Spanish language Gothic Novel.  How would a Mediterrean sensibility play out in such a different genre?<br /><br />The novel starts out well.  The setting is Barcelona in the years immediately following the Civil War.  On the day a young boy can no longer remember the face of his dead mother, he is taken to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books where he finds a book that will change his life.  Later on, he encounters a faceless man in search of the same book.  A pretty good start to a Gothic Novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ruiz Zafon then loses his nerve.  The story degenerates from Gothic Tale to Telenovela.  He does this by peopling his story with stock Telenovela characters.  The side kick with a heart of gold, the evil character dressed in a black trench coat and the beautiful blond love interest.  Soon the story is filled with stock characters going through the motions.  Whatever potential this novel had to do something different is lost in the same old platitudes.<br /><br />I love Telenovelas.  They tell fun stories and they make time go by quickly.  The Shadow of the Wind is good old fashioned Telenovela.  It is a fun book but Ruiz Zafon is not in the same league as Dickens or Dumas.  I would put him in the league of Dan Brown of the Da Vinci Code fame.  If you want to read a good contemporary Spanish novelist with something interesting to say, check out the works of Arturo Perez Reverte.
B00000J1YS|5.0|In my humble opinion, not only Dire Straits' best, but also the 2nd best rock album ever (only U2's The Joshua Tree rates better)!  Mark Knopfler is such an incredible songwriter and guitarist.  Every single song is amazing!
B0001MDP3G|4.0|This is no Braveheart, where the characters believe so wholeheartedly in the cause of war that it makes all the tragedies of war worthwhile.  I think this is one of the more realistic, epic war stories I've seen in a while.  The movie's characters are driven by the urge to survive the disasters visited upon them (brought on by the Civil War), and faith in love is what they use to keep their courage to live on from giving out. <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman and Jude Law play Ada Munroe and W.P. Inman (respectively) and their romance has barely begun to bud before he's shipped off to fight in the Civil War.  Ada is a classic southern belle and a minister's daughter who has just moved to the rural town of Cold Mountain from Charleston.  After Ada's father dies, she's left in charge of their farm and she finds survival difficult.  In her words, she says, \\"I can embroider but I can't darn.  I can arrange cut flowers but I can't grow them... I can name the principle rivers in Europe but don't ask me to name a single stream in this county.\\"  With no hope to fall back on, she relies on her fond memories of Inman to lend her enough faith to continue on and learn to survive in Cold Mountain.  Nicole Kidman portrays the helpless southern belle perfectly, and her character makes a believable transition into a credible farm owner. <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger steals the show with her Ruby Thewes--a young, no-nonsense working woman is sent to Ada to help her run the farm.  Ruby teaches Ada how to get her hands dirty and work.  Renee lends her character terrific spunk, and plays the role of a hard-on-the-outside, but soft-on-the-inside tomgirl wonderfully.   <br /> <br />The real love story is between Ada and Ruby.  It is, of course, not romantic love, but familial love.  Nicole and Renee pair together wonderfully and make a credible duo of two women trying to survive winter at their farm, and it's heartwarming to watch the two grow closer to form a new family.  Indeed, the real lovethat blossoms in this movie isn't between Ada and Inman, it's between Ada and Ruby.  It's also terrific fun to watch how Ruby's influence toughens up Ada, and Ada softens Ruby.  In the beginning of their relationship, for example, Ruby criticizes Ada for toting around a novel, since she can't see the point of carrying around a book you can't write in.  Before long, Ada begins reading to Ruby at night and Ruby ends up pestering Ada to keep reading instead of going to sleep.  You definitely see how the two rub off on each other through the course of the film. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman has a short performance, but it's the most emotionally charged and adult role I've yet to see her perform.  She was fantastic--and this is coming from somebody who has questioned her acting ability countless times.  Ruby's father Stobrod (Brenden Gleeson) and Rev. Veasey (Phillip Hoffman) were also wonderfully cast, and those two are probably the film's two most colorful characters. <br /> <br />Jude Law's Inman does the same with Ada as she does with Inman.  Ada's picture and letters remind him of something worth returning to--thus, gives him a reason to strive to survive the war.  Jude's performance is somber, subtle, serene on the surface, but intense beneath the surface.  He plays the role of the silent, conflicted warrior perfectly, and throughout his performance, you feel that his character is surviving and carrying on only to complete his return to Cold Mountain, as per Ada's request that he come back to her.  He plays his tormented character fantastically, and not to mention realistically. <br /> <br />The lovers are more symbols life before the war to each other than they are actual lovers.  Each lover represents to the other hope that life can go back to the way it was (both possessed memories of each other during happier times before the war began), and, in their minds, their reunion symbolizes the end of the war.  So, it's hardly a mystery as to why two people who were barely lovers and barely knew each other would cling so desperately onto the memories they have of each other as a beacon for hope. <br /> <br />The music was a definite bonus.  I was very impressed with the score and the songs.  In the middle of watching Cold Mountain with my husband, we both mentioned how good the music was and how we wouldn't mind purchasing the soundtrack.  It's not everyday that a movie's soundtrack impresses us so early on during the film.  They capture the feel of the South beautifully, and the music is atmospheric, ambient, bittersweet, lonely, and lovely--just like the film.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Stephen Sommers did it again: crap. He said he adapted the story of Dracula to our times? The story begins in Transylvania with Frankstein, and that's false, Frankstein was in Austria when he made the creature. An Van Helsing's name isn't Gabriel, is Abraham. Van Helsing isn't young, he's old. In the movie he looks like a mix of Spiderman, James Bond, Men in Black and Batman. In few words the movies is boring, has no plot and it's made with for people with a low I.Q..  <br /> <br />Save your money for a better movie and not in this CRAP of Stephen Sommers.
B000002J1U|4.0|Led Zeppelin's third album is known as the acoustic album, since many of the songs present are done primarily with an acoustic guitar. This album shows a side of Led Zeppelin not readily present on their albums, as many of the songs hear are among Zeppelin's mellowest and best. There are few rockers on this one, but primarily its all bout folk. Some moments here feel as if the band needed some more time in the studio, (mostly in the first half), but as a whole Led Zeppelin 3 is an awesome record. It's worth picking up. I find it hard to believe that this album didn't go diamond. Led Zeppelin 3 is one the bands most underrated albums. Listen for yourself. You may see its brilliance.
B000006NPY|5.0|This album is like a velvet backdrop to the nighttime. Corgan has described it as \\"arcane\\" and that's the truth. While it is probably the most unique album from the Pumpkins, it ranks really highly among us fans. It's about longing, mystery, and the silence within the sound - like the enigma of the slumber of death within life. <br />It definitely will bring a tear to your eye if you're a tender soul or if you have aching memories. However, shining through the darkness, you'll hear hope in this album - as with most of Billy's art. I highly recommend this album as soul-reflective, and really really special.
B000002H70|5.0|After hearing 6 songs off the Disintergration album live in San Diego 8/24/04, i immediately remembered why after 15 years i still play it more often than any other cd i own -  It is on whole the most complete sound ever produced.  No other album compacts so much emotion and power than this one - I can't wait until it is remastered at the end of this year - Long live Robert Smith
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is one of the rappers today that has signifance in their lyrics. Unlike Nelly, 50 Cent, or other generic rappers today, his debut is very personal and spiritual. He's also one of today's best producers. His best beats are Stand Up, I Am, and Slow Jamz (not on his album of course), and he is extremely sought out for a track or two. His lyrics might not be up to speed with Common, Talib Kweli, or Mos Def, but his delivery is wicked and his lyrics fit his beats like a glove, which gives us a nice lyrical display. <br /> <br />We Don't Care - Music: 8.0 Lyrics: 7.5 <br /> <br />All Falls Down - Music: 9.5 Lyrics 10.0 ------ Everything about this song is excellent, from the acoustic guitar to the well-sung Chorus. I espacially like the 3rd verse. Easily his best song. <br /> <br />Spaceship - Music: 6.5 Lyrics: 8.0 <br /> <br />Jesus Walks - Music: 9.0 Lyrics: 8.0 ------ Shows how deep he can be. <br /> <br />Never Let Me Down - Music: 8.0 Lyrics: 9.5 ------ See above. Also this is Jay-Z's final verse, and it's fire. What's better than that? A Kanye verse that otushines him. His final words are just powerful to it's fullest. The only flaw? J.Ivy's incredibly disrupting verse. <br /> <br />Get Em High - Music: 7.5 Lyrics: 9.5 ------ The guest raps laces the song together, by Talib Kweli and Common, which Kanye's beat works well over. <br /> <br />The New Workout Plan - Music: 6.0 Lyrics: 6.0 ------ One of the mediocre tracks on this album. <br /> <br />Slow Jamz - Music: 9.5 Lyrics: 7.0 <br /> <br />Breathe In Breathe Out - Music: 10.0 Lyrics: 9.0 ------ One of the most overlooked songs by him. The chorus makes the song what it is to me: a great pimp track. <br /> <br />School Spirit - Music: 8.0 Lyrics: 6.5 ------ Extremely catchy to me. A very enjoyable song. <br /> <br />Two Words - Music: 4.5 Lyrics: 7.5 <br /> <br />Through The Wire - Music: 6.5 Lyrics: 6.5 ------ A little commercial, but an excellent use of sampling. <br /> <br />Family Business - Music:7.0 Lyrics: 8.5 ------ This song is very personal, has alot of concept behind it, and is very peaceful. another over-looked track. <br /> <br />Last Call - Music: 6.0 Lyrics: 6.0 <br /> <br />So overall, this is one very solid album, and Kanye will come back even harder next year. I would give this CD a 4.5 stars, but I didn't feel it was a 5 star CD, and I felt guilty giving it a 4. So it's still a great, versatile album. Buy it, and put into the boombox. And be satisfied. <br />  <br />

B0002OOUP0|2.0|So Virgin waited a few months and now they come forward with a 'remastered' version of Jump Back. Pathetic. To begin with, the other recently compilation '40 licks' is absolutely better than this one. Second o all, the old 'Jump Back' sounded just fine, so no need to update for a revealing new sound. Third, the new cover art (?) just cannot be compared to the old version. Sorry Virgin, you are not getting my cash this time. How about a best of live stones remastered? Now, that I'd buy.
B00008EY65|4.0|This was my first introduction to both the Hellboy character and Guillermo del Toro's movies. As the rating above indicates, I enjoyed the experience. Part mutants-exploring-the-supernatural fantasy, part standard coming-of-age story, Hellboy was a pleasure to watch. I particularly liked the way Christian and Lovecraftian cosmologies were intertwined without disparaging the more traditional spiritual perspective. Some of the CGI didn't hold up well on the small-screen, but that's usually the case (more disturbing was some of the wire & harness work that looked like wire & harness work).<br /><br />The acting in the movie was well done. Even though it sometimes looks like Hellboy is wielding a giant red foam football finger, the characters have a high believability quotient. Jeffrey Tambor's character was unexpectedly fun, and I'm glad he didn't become the butt of every joke. It was also nice that the love triangle never became overwrought.<br /><br />There are some plot holes in the movie, but based on the deleted scenes on the DVD some/many/most of them will be filled in on the upcoming Director's Cut. Some questions are also answered by the commentaries, documentaries, and other bonus materials spread across the two discs. I liked being able to view all the \\"visits to the set\\" and \\"DVD comic book\\" extras separate from the movie (I don't like the big icons prompting the viewer to hit \\"ENTER\\"). The \\"Pancakes\\" comic book extra was hilarious.<br /><br />As the reviews for this movie demonstrate, there's a wide range of opinion about Hellboy.  If you didn't see it in the theater you might want to rent it first. I enjoyed the DVD sight-unseen, but if you have your doubts/don't want to be disappointed go the rental route. Also, with the Director's Cut coming out soon, you may want to rent both before deciding which (or both) to purchase.
0312263120|2.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this book reads like a screenplay. A rather chaotic screenplay I may add. It is fast-paced, yes (there are 128 chapters, i.e. approximately that number of scene changes), but it is hardly a thriller. The parts of the plot that are not predictable are simply because they are too incredulous and unbelievable to be predicted. The worst is the ending. After more than a hundred chapters you find out you've just been led on a wild-goose chase, the \\"code\\" the characters have been seeking stares at you in print but the characters only realize it 10 pages later, and the epilogue, the epilogue... I suggest they take it out in future prints because it serves no purpose except to frustrate the reader further with its ludicrousness.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Monday, August 30, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Bittersweet, quaint tale.<br /><br />Exploring deeper human themes like isolation, loneliness, and boredom this was an interesting movie, almost quaint and child-like in its telling.  World weary and tired washed up actor Bill Murray arrives in Tokyo and crosses paths with a disenchanted fledgling wife.  Together they buoy each other as they slowly become inseparable friends exploring the wonders or Tokyo beyond the glass confines of their hotel.  In a stand against cinematic convention, the two do not become lovers, if only to prove that an odd pairing like this can happen on a Platonic level.  Thankfully, we are also allowed a brief glimpse into the other natural wonders of Japan through the landscape and religious shrines as the twosome does their own exploring.  In the end, the viewer is glad that these two met and interacted, especially watching Murray grin genuinely at their final parting.

B00003CXCT|1.0|once upon a time, in a movie theatre far away, there were these three amzing films that spoke volumes to millions. <br /> <br />with the release of the \\"special\\" editions, those films are gone. <br /> <br />should there be a special edition of picasso's \\"guernica\\"? should there be a special edition of the constituion? do we need a special edition of \\"dark side of the moon\\"? <br /> <br />now, all we have are the grossly mediocre prequels. i used to be such a star wars junkie, toys, posters, shirts, vhs... i've broken free. no \\"episode III' for me, no more shelling out cash for lucas' spoiled-brat \\"vision\\". <br /> <br />these films belong to you, me, everyone, not just georgie lucas... i feel bad he felt the need to reach into our wallets as opposed to reaching into our hearts.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|the kill bill 2 soundtrack is pretty good, but there are a few things missing.  Most of the songs are good, but there could have been some more songs.  For example, the song that plays during the longer trailer(its not even in the movie, does anyone know what it is) isnt on there, as well as the song during the training sequence.  But there are great songs on there, like Malaguena Salerosa from the credits sequence and Urami Bushi from the end credits from volume 1 and 2.  If you like the movie you will most likely like the soundtrack.  I consider buying it.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I'm an APP Fan since exactly 20 years. After the project was over i missed eric woolfson on the solo-albums of AP. They were ok, but not as good as the project's cd's. Now, Alan changed his music into electronic, but you hear it out it is still Alan's music! I love the whole CD, it's A MASTERPIECE! The quality of the sound is a clearly \\"10\\". The songs are perfect! I really like the new \\"Mammagamma 04\\", it is even better then the original, and that's rare! I love the voice of Alan Parsons on \\"We play the game\\". He is a fantastic singer, why he didn't sing before?!??!? I can't understand when a longtime APP-Fan don't like this album, it is still Parsons-music, but more trendy. i don't know if he reach younger people, that will be difficult, because they don't know his music. But for me: it is one of my favourite album since 10 years!
B000000XCH|5.0|For many years I was a classical music snob and didn't pay much attention to rock bands.  CCR was probably one of the first really \\"rocking\\" band to win me over to rock and roll.  This is undoubtedly their best album.  I agree with one reviewer that the album cover was cheesy and didn't really reveal how good the contents were.  If you can only own one CCR album, this should be the one.  This is an essential for your collection.  This is good music, even though \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" does get a little tedious before it ends.  A little shorter version might have been a good idea.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|i really didn't like the movie as a whole, but renee zellweger made it impossible not to like and watch over and over. i don't know why i like her so much, but i find her absolouty irresistable. i first discovered her when she played roxie hart in \\"chicago\\". and she's been my fav actress ever since. i think she's fabulous in this movie. i have seen that some people said that nicole kidman was better, and o she was so beautiful and renee was so scruffy, and she should have won an oscar instead of renee.(most people said that nicole sucked and renee stole the show).but we all know that on the red carpet renee looks gorgeous and classy, so i think it takes alot more courage and talent to play a role where your not always perfect and pretty all the time, it's called acting. nicole is so boring,she always plays the same character, which is the perfect beautiful character, and that's about as far as her range is. on the other hand renee can play the sizzling hot roxie hart and the beautiful sedectress wtitter barbra novak \\"down with love\\". or the fat, clumsy drunk \\"bridget jones diary\\" and gritty hardcore ruby \\"cold mountain\\". so anyway, though boring at times i think cold mountain is worth seeing.  <br /> <br /> <br />             at least rent it!!!!!!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|You could say that it's all recycled, the riffs, the attitude, etc., but what isn't these days.  I have not heard many Cd's of late (let alone a debut album) that sound this good from start to finish.  Rather than plumb the depths of existential sorrow, FF offer crisp pop tunes leavened with a little bitterness and an extra helping of tongue in cheek world weariness.  Reminds me more of Elastica or the Auteurs from the mid-90's than Joy Division or the early Cure as some note.
B00001QEE9|5.0|MY FIRST MOVIE!<br /><br />This movie has a special place in my heart in that I first saw it at about age 5 with my dad and it was a momentous occasion.  I still remember that day because it was the first time I had ever set foot into a movie theatre.  And there's a moral to the story-don't tell a lie.  Poor Pinocchio, every time he even attempted to tell a lie, the whole world knew about it just by looking at his nose!  When you wish upon a star is one of my favorite Disney songs, and I love Jiminy Cricket.<br /><br />'Look at the crowds bleeding with laughter, at the way you entertain at beckon call. They don't see beyond the lights, or the painted background.<br /><br />THEY JUST LIKE TO SEE YOU FALL.'-Jars of Clay's song A Boy on a String
B00004YW6I|4.0|An awful lot of fans (and supposedly Ms, H herself) don't care for this album.  It certainly is the least militant of her many fine releases.  Rather than tales of sexual frustration, Gothic backwoods tales and general angst,  STORIES OF THE CITY, STORIES FROM THE SEA seems to center more on roles inside a relationship not in peril.  I do find the call of sell out to be a riot however.  Channeling Patti Smith and the Pretenders is hardly the key to fame, fortune and the cover of PEOPLE MAGAZINE in this new millenium.  I will certainly take this over Liz Phair's latest, which is more of an overt attempt to move product than this.<br /><br />Not a bonafide classic, but far from a hollow attemp to grasp the commercial gold ring that some would lead you to believe, STORIES contains several excellent songs including THIS IS LOVE, THE WHORE'S HUSTLE, GOOD FORTUNE and YOU SAID SOMETHING.  I guess it all boils down to wanting soul-baring emotionally wringing confessions, or a catchy tune.<br /><br />It's your call
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I had been hearing about this album for months. I got home, listened to like 8 songs and couldn't take it anymore. This album was the biggest let-down in the history of music. The only good songs are vermillion and duality. Iowa was the best album. Their self titled album was good too. Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat I didn't like toom much. But I like that better than this album.
B00000I1GO|4.0|I first saw this film when it was released in the mid nineteen seventies. I recalled how much I had enjoyed it, and when I saw that the film was available on DVD, I was happy to purchase it. The DVD itself is somewhat disappointing, as it offers virtually none of the special features one has come to expect from a DVD. Moreover, the transfer quality of the print is poor, as it is grainy, at best.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the technical shortcomings of the DVD, the film itself, though somewhat abstract, is terrific, as it is not just a science fiction film with a twist. It is a film that explores themes that are timeless: desolation, alienation (no pun intended), and loneliness. At times, these themes are palpable, due to David Bowie's wondrously androgynous performance, which is heartbreakingly moving, at times.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. An alien, played with virtuosity by Davie Bowie, leaves his family on his dying and arid planet in search for water. He lands on earth and begins his project to send water to his devastated planet by amassing the wealth that he needs to do this. He patents numerous lucrative inventions which eventually find him at the head of a world wide conglomerate. He joins up with a kindly, though stupid and vapid woman who drinks gin like a fish, a part into which Candy Clark sinks her teeth. Our lonely alien begins a liaison of sorts with her. Yet, he continues to be lonely and melancholic and, like his earthly consort, begins to spiral into an alcoholic haze, which serves to sidetrack him somewhat from his purpose here on Earth.<br /><br />At some point, excruciatingly sad and lonely, longing for his family, he reveals himself to her for who he truly is, shedding his earthly appearance, only to be met with absolute horror and repugnance by her at the sight of him. She ultimately tries to understand him, but it is truly beyond her ken. He is infinitely sad at this and longs all the more for home, where he can truly be himself and be accepted as such.<br /><br />On the threshold of returning to his planet and loved ones, he is kidnapped by corporate raiders who take over his holdings, and it is here that the movie begins to disintegrate somewhat. Yet, it remains strangely hypnotic and compelling, and becomes a sort of lost weekend of betrayal, booze, and promises that will never be kept. A parable of wanting to belong, yet knowing one never will. A story about wanting to go home, but knowing on some level that one can truly never go home again.be accepted as such.<br /><br />On the threshold of returning to his planet and loved ones, he is kidnapped by corporate raiders who take over his holdings, and it is here that the movie begins to disintegrate somewhat.

B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is a PERFECT 10.Lauryn Hill has gone down in history to set the foundation for some of todays hip/hop R&B and pushed forward the movement into neo-soul music.This album is beautful from beginning to end.Ever since she was in Sister Act II and debuting with the Fugees this girl has showed that she has talent.She can act,rap and sing her A$* off.Evident on  the songs \\"To Zion\\", \\"Lost Ones\\", \\"Doo Whop(That Thing)\\",\\"Nothing Even Matters\\" , \\"I Used To Love Him\\" this girl is talented.No wonder this album was such a huge huge hit.It has also been counted as one of the top 50 albums that you MUST HAVE and number one album to have on many many websites and magazines.If you dont have it you are for sure missing out on GROUNDBREAKING MUSIC!!!! <br /> <br />OVERALL GRADE  100/100   =  A++
B000067JD5|5.0|This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portrayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial. He ignores all the standard warning signs, until it is nearly too late.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance. He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican general, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego businessman, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold bloodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!<br /><br />There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.in jail, awaiting trial.

B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Although I was a college student in the 80's, I don't automatically get all warm and fuzzy when I hear of an 80's retro trend.  I bought this album on the strength of \\"Take Me Out,\\" and was rather surprised by the Rutgers flashbacks I experienced.  I can't say that my hand stays off the skip button, but it has entered my heavy rotation.  Don't look to it for deep lyrics or world changing innovation, but certainly turn to it for a very good time.  Nicely crafted, danceable pop.
B000063DI8|2.0|This album, one of Bruce-Maiden's worst, shows again that bands should make sure the material in the album is good before putting words like die or dying in the title. Another istance is \\"Never Say Die\\" by Black Sabbath, which was the last album with the legendary original lineup. <br /> <br />Although Iron Maiden did go on to record one more album with Bruce Dickinson (\\"Fear of the Dark\\" which is a little better than this one) this was the beginning of the end. However, it still doesn't prevent the Maidens from cementing themselves as one of the top bands in metal history.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|Rust In Peace(1990). Megadeth's Fourth Album, And The First And Last To Feature Guitarist Randy Friedman.<br /><br />Before Thrash broke open with Metallica's self-titled release, Megadeth's 'Countdown To Extinction', and Anthrax's 'Sound of White Noise'(all which were Top 5 hits) in 1991, each of those bands, under the mainstream radar, had been releasing masterpieces for years, and it wasn't until they became popular that fans have came to enjoy their earlier work. Such is the case with Megadeth's, whose best release is debateable as either 'Rust In Peace' or 'Peace Sells....But Who's Buying?', but typically, the guitar virtuoso performances and pure Thrash sound of 'Rust In Peace' make it the common favorite. Although Dave Mustaine and Megadeth were getting a bad rap for 'So Far, So Good, So What?', Mustaine decided to hire guitarist Randy Friedman, which will forever be remembered as one of his best decisions for the band. Friedman and Mustaine brought the electric and heavy metal guitar riffs and solos to new levels, and while this album is typically known as a Thrash album, to any guitarists or fans of the instrument will tell you, this is one of the best guitar albums out there. Over the years, songs like 'Holy Wars....The Punishment Due' and 'Hangar 18' have rightfully become two of the band's biggest hits. Since Dave Mustaine recently re-mastered most of Megadeth's catalogue(PS..BWB through Risk), I decided to try out Megadeth for the first time and picked up the legendary 'Rust In Peace'. So, was I impressed or disappointed? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Holy Wars...The Punishment Due- Often praised as Megadeth's best, arguing against that statement it almost impossible. A six minute opus of crunching riffs, blistering and haunting solos, creepy lyrics and vocals, not to mention the countless time signature changes make \\"Holy Wars\\" a masterpiece. Mustaine keeps the song flowing, as it never, ever stays the same longer than 10 seconds! Only Metallica's \\"One\\" is better than this song in the Speed/Thrash Metal Genre!<br /><br />Hangar 18- Although it starts as a thrashy paranoid statement against the government, chockful of fiery vocals and a doomy riff, \\"Hangar 18\\" mainly serves as a chance for Mustaine and Friedman to flex their guitar skills. For a little over 4(!) minutes, these guys rip out seven chords worth of metallic bliss. It's almost impossible not to love this song! \\"Hangar 18\\" and \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\" couldn't have started 'Rust In Peace' off better!<br /><br />Take No Prisoners- Almost a thrash anthem, \\"Take No Prisoners\\" urges people to destroy anyone who comes in their way, and most importantly, \\"take no prisoners, take no s**t!\\". Dark and uncompromising, Menza's fever-pitch drumming, Friedman's rebellious riff and Mustaine's anarchatic vocals make you feel like pumping your fists and moshing! E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T!<br /><br />Five Magics- One of Megadeth's darkest and gloomiest tracks, \\"Five Magics\\" stirs the listener up with its creepy bassline and foreboding guitar harmonies. Although Mustaine gets in a few vocals here and there, he and Friedman belt out some amazing guitar solos, from out-right doomy to melodic, and it makes for quite a surreal listen. The chorus is thrash gold, and yet again Megadeth proves themselves to be Thrash Gods.<br /><br />Poison Was The Cure- Another doomy track, \\"Poison Was The Cure\\" begins with an expectant bassline, and unsurprisingly Friedman and Mustaine's crunching guitar riff builds up to a speedy thrasher not unlike Motorhead or Iron Maiden. Yet again, the band is in top-form here, and this song won't fail to please.<br /><br />Lucretia- Beginning with a witch laughing, \\"Lucretia\\" soon builds up to a punky thrash metal masterpiece, featuring dark, melodic punk riffs from Friedman and Mustaine and sarcastic vocals from Mustaine. When I hear this, I immediately think of a combination of Anthrax and The Sex Pistols. I'm liking this song more and more...<br /><br />Tornado of Souls- Ah yes, \\"Tornado of Souls\\"! Another fan favorite, Megadeth sounds much like they would become on 'Countdown To Extinction', and also, \\"Tornado of Souls\\" echoes back to Testament's masterpiece \\"Souls of Black\\". The guitarwork is phenomenal, with super-fast sludgy riffs, but what stands out the most is Mustaine's vocals, which, during the chorus, are absolutely guaranteed to get your head banging!  Great musicianship, vocals, lyrics, solos....GREAT SONG!<br /><br />Dawn Patrol- If you sampled a particuarly dark Black Sabbath song, and put a drunken psychopath at vocals, you would get \\"Dawn Patrol\\". Ellefson's creepy bassline and Mustaine's slightly (british?) accented vocals create a song that is obviously filler, but it's still downright cool!<br /><br />Rust In Peace...Polaris- The track to end them all, \\"Rust In Peace...Polaris\\" is another fan favorite, a somber thrash metal classic that combines the lyrics and tone of Anthrax with the heaviness of Judas Priest. Mustaine's vocals are criticizing and angry, while Friedman and Mustaine rip out solos and riffs that Yngwie Malmsteen would be proud of. A great way to end an album!<br /><br />In 2004, Dave Mustaine remastered the Megadeth albums 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?', 'So Far, So Good, So What?', 'Rust In Peace', 'Countdown To Extinction', 'Youthanasia', and 'Risk', increasing the sound quality and adding it bonus tracks, not to mention interesting liner notes that include commentary from Dave and full lyrics. On 'Rust In Peace', Mustaine added new lyrics and guitar solos to \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\", \\"Rust In Peace...Polaris\\", and \\"Take No Prisoners\\", which sound very close to the originals. He also added in an interesting, but short rocker titled \\"My Creation\\".<br /><br />Overall, 'Rust In Peace' is a thrash classic, easily standing among Metallica's 'Master of Puppets', Anthrax's 'Persistence of Time', Testament's 'The New Order', and Slayer's 'Reign In Blood'. Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine are guitar and songwriting genuises, and it shows: 'Rust In Peace' has some of the most complex and intricate songwriting, not to mention guitarwork that will effectively blow your mind. 'Rust In Peace' is absolutely essential for guitar players, or anybody who wants to widen their Heavy Metal/Thrash collection.ouls\\"!

B00005JN2F|2.0|The Bourne Supremacy(2004). The Second Movie In The Jason Bourne Series.<br /><br />In 2002, 'The Bourne Identity', starring Matt Damon and based on the novel by Robert Ludlum of the same name, became the sleeper hit of the summer, easily earning over  $150 million dollars and garnering much critical acclaim. A solid mixture of espionage, amnesia, mystery, and intense car chases and battle sequences held the audiences attention throughout, not to mention stellar acting. It's no surprise that the sequel to 'The Bourne Identity' was released, since there was already a novel for it! In 2004, 'The Bourne Supremacy' was released, and while the critics weren't as warm to it as last time, it still got big crowds in and (as of August 30th) has earned over $150 million like its predecessor. I was a big fan of the first movie, so did I enjoy the sequel or not? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />Jason Bourne, after escaping the clutches of the CIA, goes into a peaceful seclusion with his girlfriend in India. Although he thinks that he's going to be left alone, he's framed by a Russian assassin for the murder of two CIA operatives, and once again the CIA's after him. As the whole world collectively cracks down on Jason Bourne, he travels all around Asia and Europe, risking his life to find out who framed him and to avenge his girlfriend's death. From Naples, to Berlin, to Moscow, Jason hunts down the assassin and further solves the mysteries of his past life as a CIA operative.<br /><br />Opinions-<br /><br />Right off the bat, fans of the first movie will be kind of taken aback, since 'The Bourne Supremacy' has absolutely nothing to do with it, and if you're new to the series, you won't have trouble with the story. Matt Damon does a great job of acting the part of a disillusioned hitman on the run, while the other actors also do a notable job. Although the story drags at some parts, 'The Bourne Supremacy' basically keeps the viewer interested, but at times you are left wondering \\"what just happened?\\" or \\"who's that?\\", or the scene's just flat-out boring and meaningless to the plot. In the beginning of the movie, I had no clue what was happening, which is very rare for me. Also, in the second movie, the plot, while being *good*, is flat-out terrible compared to the original movie's. The characters are less enjoyable, the story's predictable, and there's absolutely NO suspense or mystery, totally unlike the first and disappointing in its own right. Another problem I have with the movie is the camerawork: Although not being as bad as 'The Blair Witch Project' or 'Open Water', whoever the cameraman was for this movie should see a doctor, because he's either got Parkinson's Disease or an uncontrollable twitch. The camera, throughout, NEVER stops shaking! During the chase scenes, it's hard to even know what's going on! Anyways, the movie is interesting, if not a bit unfocused. On the positive note, there is good acting and very well-done chase scenes, but don't come in expecting anything near as good as the first, or else you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Bourne Supremacy' hits that famous sophomore slump, sporting a weak plot and uninteresting developments, but still containing some rewarding moments(taxi chase anyone?) and good acting. What's odd about this movie, and really made me wonder, is why a Spy/Action movie has NO suspense or mystery! Odd! Likewise, the movie is extremely predictable, since there's nothing to predict! You already know the answers, you just see Bourne figure them out for himself out. (...)<br />RECOMMEDED FOR FANS OF THE FIRST MOVIE AND THE ROBERT LUDLUM NOVELS.

0792146670|5.0|The Federation discovers a dubious plot by the Cardassians as they have several troop movements and rotations and nefarious dealings with other races. They have strong suspicions that they are developing a Metagenic weapon. Metagenic weapons are the epitome of biological warfare. When dropped onto a planet, they seek out, feed on and destroy anything with DNA - so all things with life are killed and gone. After a few weeks, the metagenic agent becomes inert, allowing those who deployed it to take over the planet - no hostile animal life, no people, just buildings and technology to take as they choose.<br /><br />Picard wrote the book on the types of emissions coming from the secret Cardassian base. Dr. Crusher is an expert on identifying and destroying metagenic organisms and Worf is a big guy, able to take one two Cardassians with one head-butt.<br /><br />Picard, Crusher and Worf train for days, without the crew's knowledge. By Federation order, Captain Jellico (Ronny Cox) captains the Enterprise. Starfleet probably has their counterpart to \\"Navy Seals,\\" but instead they send some of the top officers from their flagship by themselves to take on such a task - a bit corny if you ask me.<br /><br />Jellico is a micromanager and worse, he doesn't explain to his new crew why he adds shift rotations or has to have certain things a certain way. He wants Picard's fish removed from the Ready Room - Picard is still onboard, but Jellico believes his fate is sealed, since it's unlikely Picard will survive his mission, even if he is successful in finding and destroying the weapon.<br /><br />Jellico makes the crew jumpy and annoyed - but other than Data, they are less than professional in their response. Geordi is a bit whiny - \\"but we'll have to work all around the clock!\\" They may be a research vessel, but they're also armed to the teeth for their various encounters... on occasion, their research vessel becomes a warship, but Geordi doesn't seem to remember that from previous battles or from his Starfleet Academy training.<br /><br />Counselor Troi tries to help Jellico see the error of his ways and he turns the tables on her - telling her since she's the expert, it's up to her to keep morale up, because he doesn't have the time to \\"have a honeymoon\\" with the crew... and then he tells her that she isn't dressed professionally (I must say, I had been thinking this for years!) and needs to wear a standard uniform... thus forever setting the course in which she wears professional attire on all shows. Hallelujah.  Even still, Jellico is a jerk of the highest order.<br /><br />He expects everyone to obey without knowledge or questions and puts everyone in perplexing situations and makes the crew generally disdainful and uneasy around him. Jellico was chosen because he supposedly has so much experience with Cardassians, but his experience would appear more book knowledge than from real dealings - because as Troi is able to detect, he is far from sure of himself.<br /><br />As Jellico, Riker & Troi try to do a dance with Cardassians at the border, Picard's team of 3 (including himself) acquire a Ferengi transport to the Cardassian world supposedly storing the Metagenic weapon. They have to repel down caves and fend off giant alien bats. They find the supposed area where the weapon is held and suddenly they find themselves surrounded by Cardassians. It's a trap!<br /><br />Worf & Crusher are able to escape, but Picard is caught and brought to Gul Madred (superbly acted by David Warner). All Federation citizens know that to be interrogated by the Cardassians is a euphemism for torture and a cruel death. Picard steeles himself, preparing to be beaten & interrogated for Federation secrets when Madred explains that there never was a Metagenic weapon, but made it appear they did so they could capture Picard. But why? Is this a personal grudge? What does Gul Madred want from Picard?<br /><br />Will Jellico continue as captain of the Enterprise? Willtheir be a war with the Cardassian Empire after years of an uneasy peace? Will Jellico, obviously disgusted with Riker, have Riker demoted or transferred? Talk about a crazy shake-up!<br /><br />This episode has a million nuggets of awesome packed into every minute... but you won't know what happens until you see part II!he Enterprise?

B000002NIW|5.0|The Deftones are my favorite band. This has got to be my favorite Deftones CD (actually my favorite CD all together). But don't get me wrong, I love everything by the Deftones. Meaningful lyrics and great guitar riffs. I also think Chino has one of the most interesting and different voices, which is a reason I love the Deftones over any other band. Also the music doesn't like a lame studio band, like Nickelback for example. Most bands these days are disposable MTV bands that all sound alike. But not the Deftones. Some people say that Chino is whining the whole time, and those people obviously haven't listened to the CD. He can be very agressive such as in \\"My Own Summer\\" \\"Rickets\\" or \\"Headup\\" and also sweet and mellow such as in \\"Mascara\\" \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" or \\"Dai the Flu\\". I don't think there is much whining in this CD. If you want whining get your precious Hoobastink CD. People who don't like the Deftones are people who prefer MTV bands like Hoobastink. So you don't need to listen to them. Don't listen to any Deftones CD once and then hate it, you need to listen to it a few times to let it grow on you. It's not catchy MTV music so you won't love it right away, but when you do start to like it, you will never get sick of it.
0385504209|4.0|No doubt about it, The Da Vinci Code is a great read. The book has it all: lightning-fast pace, mostly believable characters, easy-to-read style, mystery, intrigue, clever plot twists and adventure. What, after all, could be more captivating than the quest for the Holy Grail? The Grail being our ultimate understanding of our spiritual past, present and our hoped-for future.<br /><br />By now the plot is well-known to most: Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is called upon to help investigate the murder of the elderly curator of the Louvre. Soon, with the help of attractive French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, it becomes clear that the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion, a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. (This secret society did actually exist, which makes the plot that much more believable-and problematic for those who take the book's premise seriously-if some is true, it must all be true, right? Well, no!)<br /><br />Langdon's investigation proceeds from riddle to clue, from puzzle to picture. That picture being Leonardo Da Vinci's \\"Last Supper,\\" with Jesus bidding farewell to his disciples.<br /><br />Unraveling all this is great cross-word-solving pleasure. In the end, though, what the \\"solution\\" finally points to is what has made this book the controversial blockbuster it has become: a restructuring of the story of Jesus Christ's life and by extension an annihilation of Christian dogma and Christian faith for those who would believe that the fiction is, in reality, based on fact.<br /><br />This is an exhilarating turn of events both for those who despise religion in general and for those who loath-or envy-Christianity, in particular the perfection that was Jesus' life.<br /><br />But ultimately, in my opinion, the book is a mere tinkering around the edges of what is the central question of human existence: Where do we come from? What is our true nature? What is the nature of God? And what is our relationship to him (or her, if you prefer)? These are the questions, only hinted at in books like Da Vinci Code, that plague our collective mind's and cause us to keep searching. There are better books out there.him (or her, if you prefer)?

B000002W9P|5.0|Helloween's Keeper Of The Seven Keys, Pt. 1 (1987) is a true heavy metal classic. It features a great many redeeming qualities. Singer Michael Kiske has a great range and a voice somewhat reminiscent of Queensryche's Geoff Tate. Guitarists Kai Hansen and Michael Weikath are both very good, and they are definetely more than simple one-trick ponies. They are great at producing synchronized melodies, as well as amazing twin harmonies. Bassist Markus Grosskopf is top-notch, he usually plays in time with the guitars! Drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg is great, he may not be able to produce great blast beats like Pete from Morbid Angel or Steve from Deicide, but he's great either way.<br /><br />The highlights of this album are as follows: actual opener \\"I'm Alive\\" (first track \\"Initiation\\" is just an instrumental prelude) has a high tempo, not to mention a great hook. \\"Future World\\" has a great beat, and the solos are incredible. And then there's \\"Halloween.\\" It's definetely Helloween's best song, clocking in at a whopping 13 minutes, 18 seconds. The harmony solo about 2/3 of the way through the song is amazing! All the tempo changes really add depth to the song. Markus really let's it all go on that bass. Kiske's vocals are at their best here. Overall, the album is almost perfect. I say that because it is only 37 minutes long, but that's the sole flaw on the entire album. Highly recommended for fans of such bands as Edguy, Blind Guardian, Iced Earth, Stratovarius, and more.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Michael Mann's \\"Collateral\\" is as an intense, edge-of-your-seat action thriller as you'll find this summer, thanks to Mann's breathless yet elegant directorial style and the cat-and-mouse chemistry between stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Stuart Beattie's screenplay turns the screws on Max Durocher (Foxx), an amiable L.A. cabbie who suddenly finds his cab commandeered by a sociopathic hit man named Vincent (Cruise). Villainy becomes Cruise: he is gleefully charismatic in a role that is as much as possible devoid of redeeming human qualities. And Foxx really makes you feel for Max, a nice guy coasting through life who now must call on long-unused reserves of resourcefulness and cunning, simply to live through the night. There also are an unflappable L.A. cop on Vincent's trail, played by the usually very flappable Mark Ruffalo; a sexy district attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith; a malevolent drug kingpin played by Javier Bardem; and Max's disapproving mom, played by Irma P. Hall in the movie's sharpest comic relief. The photography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron makes a glittering, sprawling deathtrap of Los Angeles, adding immeasurably to the film's slick malevolence.
0312263120|3.0|Others have panned this book for it's content and lack of realistic data.  It is Fiction you know.  And the manuscript was penned in 1998 so to compare the work to his others may be a bit out of construct. In addition some of the detail regarding the Super Computer and the 'Crypto' files is dated as well. <br />I enjoyed the characters, although I felt that some of the responses and reactions by David Becker were below the intelligence level of a Professor and Educator. <br />Is it on par with DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons? No, but it was a good read (or in my case a listen) and the twists so add a sense of surprise during the climax. <br /> <br />I enjoyed it and hope to see more from Dan Brown in the future.
B00005JMEW|5.0|By the time \\"Pulp Fiction\\" came out we all knew that Tarantino was no ordinary director, after his break into stardom with the cult classic \\"Reservoir Dogs\\". After a nine-year hiatus, he came back with a movie that's a pastiche of styles and another successful attempt by the director/writer to share his cinematic vision.<br /><br />The movie borrows equally from westerns, kung-fu/samurai movies and anime flics, with the broken timeline that is so characteristic of Tarantino movies. Add to that an exquisite soundtrack (largely courtesy of RZA, with eclectic touches by a range of artists and genres, from Nancy Sinatra all the way to Zamfir's pan flute, and flamenco music) and you got another cult classic right out the gate.<br /><br />While not as great as Pulp Fiction, the movie elements that make Tarantino great are all here. There is a good share of  violent moments, though they are mostly toned \\"down\\" by the sheer exaggeration of some of them, which makes them surreal at best. There is a host of dialogue lines (most of them by Uma's character, The Bride) that are ready to become standard e-mail signatures. Finally, the art direction was impeccable: the incorporation of an anime to tell the story of the childhood of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu's character) was simply brilliant!<br /><br />All in all, in spite of the violence (not a HUGE fan of blood, I admit it), I loved the movie and I have Volume 2 lined up to be watched next weekend...

B000000H40|5.0|Obituary's second studio album from 1990, &#34;Cause of Death&#34; is truly without question a true essential death metal masterpiece, and it's also the best Obituary album ever hands down as well. Along with Suffocation's &#34;Effigy of the Forgotten&#34;, Deicide's 1990 self titled debut and 1992 sophomore release &#34;Legion&#34;, Death's &#34;Spiritual Healing&#34;, Cannibal Corpse's &#34;The Bleeding&#34;, Dismember's &#34;Like an Everflowing Stream&#34;, and Morbid Angel's &#34;Covenant&#34;, Obituary's &#34;Cause of Death&#34; is definitely one of the best death metal albums to come out in the 90's. Words just cannot describe how awesome this album truly is. It has got absolutely everything that a death metal fan like myself could ask for: Wicked vocals, sick and twisted heavy riffs (a mixture of blisteringly fast and slow, bone crushing), and phenomenal solos, killer rhythms, tight drumming, I mean it's all on here, believe me. The album art cover is really awesome as it just gives you that dark, twisted, and eerie feeling throughout. John Tardy just sounds absolutely evil and wicked throughout with his sick, evil, morbid and inhuman vocals. This guy is definitely one of the best death metal vocalists ever, no questions asked. He is just an absolute monster on the mic throughout this album as he bulldozes his way over everything in his path with his vocals. Elsewhere, the guitars are another major highlight on the album. First off, you have rhythm guitarist Trevor Peres who is in top form here as he busts and cranks out an endless abundance of heavy thick, grinding, meaty, crunchy and tremolo-picked riffing throughout one song after the next, and of course, you've got on lead guitar, legendary journeyman shredder James Murphy, who was fresh off his work on Death's classic third release, &#34;Spiritual Healing&#34; (which was released in 1990 before this album). His solos on here are just absolutely phenomenal, jaw dropping, eargasmic and godly throughout, guaranteed to make your face melt and teeth grin with pure delight. While Allen West's guitar solos on Obituary's classic 1989 debut, &#34;Slowly We Rot&#34; were more chaotic, blazing and fast paced, James Murphy's solos on here are much more melodic, technical, atmospheric and classical influenced, and they really pack a ton of emotion as well. Meanwhile, Frank Watkins' bass is actually audible and very well heard throughout this album here as he pounds out tons of awesome, thick and fuzzy bass lines throughout, and Donald Tardy (John's brother) is also a very talented and superb drummer as he delivers a fantastic performance behind the kit with all sorts of killer beats and fills, awesome double bass foot work, and everything else in between. The production by Scott Burns is also much more better sounding than it was on &#34;Slowly We Rot&#34; while not being too raw nor being too clean either.<br /><br />Every song on this album is a classic including the wicked classic opener &#34;Infected&#34; which is jam packed with tons of great wicked riffs (including a sick, dark and foreboding opening riff), plus awesome soloing from James, plus excellent drumming from Donald and sick, killer vocals from John especially during the part when he screams &#34;INFECTEEEEEED&#34; which will just send shivers down your spine. &#34;Body Bag&#34; is an excellent second track that features a very catchy and sinister opening riff (which is without a doubt, one of the catchiest and most memorable riffs on the album), along with more great, brutal riffing throughout, excellent vocal patterns, blistering double bass drumming and another fantastic solo. Track three, &#34;Chopped in Half&#34; is also another classic track that features a great opening in which John screams &#34;CHOPPED IN HALF...FEEL THE BLOOD SPILL FROM YOUR MOUTH&#34;!!! over a great, crunchy and lurching opening riff, plus the song also features yet more savage fast tempos (including seething, chainsaw-like riffing and hammering drums), plus another tasty, winding, melodic, shred-worthy solo by James near the end as well. Next, we have an excellent cover of Celtic Frost's &#34;Circle of the Tyrants&#34;, and believe me, the guys from Obituary here really nailed this cover to absolute perfection, and it's certainly no secret you can truly hear the CF influence in Obituary's sound, and this cover shows it. Next up, we have track five, &#34;Dying&#34; which is another one of my favorites on here with the first half being mostly instrumental features great catchy, groovy, pummeling riff work and hypnotic double bass beats and another wicked solo from James and the second half featuring some wicked and menacing growls from John, and then the song works right into another classic song &#34;Find the Arise&#34;. I just love how the song starts off with that explosion sound and then John screams out &#34;STOP&#34;! FIND THE ARISE, KILL AT FIRST SITE&#34;! This song also includes more breakneck riffing and fantastic soloing, and violent fast tempos as well. The albums' title track, &#34;Cause of Death&#34; is yet another classic track here that features a fantastic, winding, melodic guitar solo by James in the opening, and also features yet more amazingly wicked riffs, killer vocals from John and blistering double bass drum work from Donald, and I also love the chorus in this song as well too, meanwhile track eight, &#34;Memories Remain&#34; is highlighted by more phenomenal, face melting, and melodic soloing by James, plus more beastly screams from John, and a really cool outro, and the final track &#34;Turned Inside Out&#34; which is just an all around wicked closer that features a variety of tempos, as well as more fantastic solos and wicked riffs, and killer vocals.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Cause of Death&#34; is a true death metal classic, and definitely one of the greatest albums in the history of death metal music as well. Every single song on this album is a classic, I mean they all just stand out from beginning to end. In other words, they all rule. As an added bonus, we're also treated with bonus demo versions of &#34;Infected&#34;, &#34;Memories Remain&#34;, and &#34;Chopped in Half&#34; as well. If there ever was a certain death metal album that always gets me in the right frame of mind even whenever I'm having a rough day or something, then &#34;Cause of Death&#34; is definitely that one album. Anyways, if you loved &#34;Slowly We Rot&#34;, then by all means you will definitely love &#34;Cause of Death&#34;...Highly Recommended!!!

B000092Q4U|5.0|Lamb Of God aren't just a great band to listen to, they put on a stellar live show. Here's how I got into them.<br /><br />1. I was watching my favorite show, none other than the Headbanger's Ball, and the video for \\"11th Hour\\" came on. I saw it, and I was hooked.<br /><br />2. I purchased the Freddy vs. Jason soundtrack, only to find out that \\"11th Hour\\" was on the album.<br /><br />3. I purchased the Headbanger's Ball CD out of interest (and my love for the show) only to find out that the song \\"Ruin\\" by Lamb Of God was on the second disc.<br /><br />4. Finally, with some of my Christmas money, I buy the album, and my expectations were met.<br /><br />5. I saw them at Ozzfest, and found out that they are amazing live.<br /><br />I doubt that this cycle will ever happen to you, but if it does by some miracle, I hope you end up as happy as I was.
1592400876|4.0|Eats, Shoots and Leaves - The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation is a charmingly written guide to punctuation, something many people care little about and know less. But for those who do care (the 'sticklers', as author Lynn Truss calls them) and would like to learn - or simply enjoy a fun read on the subject, it's hard to recommend it highly enough. It is more than readable, it is very clear, and the author's attitude can only be admired by fellow sticklers, to wit: <br /> <br />The confusion of the possessive \\"its\\" (no apostrophe) with the contractive \\"it's\\" (with apostrophe) is an unequivocal signal of illiteracy and sets off a simple Pavlovian \\"kill\\" response in the average stickler. The rule is: the word \\"it's\\" (with apostrophe) stands for \\"it is\\" or \\"it has\\". If the word does not stand for \\"it is\\" or \\"it has\\" then what you require is \\"its\\". &lt;em>This is extremely easy to grasp.&lt;/em> Getting your itses mixed up is the greatest solecism in the world of punctuation. No matter that you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice. If you still persist in writing, \\"Good food at it's best\\", you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave. <br /> <br />Brava! I say. <br /> <br />Despite this apparently hard-line approach, Truss is the first to admit that even sticklers do not necessarily agree with one another. As a case in point, I find her style far too fast and loose with commas (or lack thereof). To my stylistic sensibilities, the title should be Eats, Shoots, and Leaves, 'zero tolerance' should be hyphenated when used as a compound adjective, and independent clauses in sentences should always be separated by commas no matter how short they may be. <br /> <br />What sticklers all agree on, however, is that punctuation does matter. It is, as Truss says in the introduction, simply a matter of good manners in writing--and we could all stand to use good manners.
B00007E8SW|5.0|... I wonder how much the awesome result is due to the Rudy Van gelder re-mastering process rather than to the DSD-SACD new teach. I wonder sometimes if the music major are trying to sell us the n-th remastering and try to make us re-buy our music collection again and again. It would also be nice to compare the same re-mastering hi-rez DVD-A and DSD-SACD.<br /><br />BTW I am astonished how much better it is compared to my vynil (I did not buy the red-book CD waiting for a hi-rez re-issue :-) )<br /><br />5 stars to the music (I'd vote 6 starts if possible ...) and 5 stars to the sound
B0002IQHY8|5.0|At first I was quite skeptical about the new Alan Parsons' CD. I don't like electronica and was not sure of what the result would be. But now, after the very first seconds of listening, with the highly psychodelic 'Return to Tunguska', I am very pleasently surprised. <br /> <br />Yes, as other reviewers have noted, this is still Alan Parsons, and very modern. He has been able to adapt perfectly to the modern times, while keeping most of the \\"music of the spheres\\" atmosphere from the APP old times. <br /> <br />If you liked the instrumental parts in the APP albums, you will enjoy this CD. <br /> <br />And, yes, Alan voice is just incredible. I read he had been awarded for that but that he almost never sung. Bad choice, he should do more often.

Simple, Evanescence are nothin but another trendy band that sucks ass along with Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Puddle Of Mudd, Sum 41, Hoobastank, Fountains Of Wayne, and Blink 182. If you real music, look no further than Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual, Damageplan, Lacuna Coil, Slayer, Deicide, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Slipknot, Death, Lamb Of God, Metallica, Sepultura, Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Nile, and Suffocation.

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Over the years, director Clint Eastwood has slowly amassed a collection of film credits that are as eclectic as they are impressive. He has tackled everything from commercial potboilers (Absolute Power), romantic tearjerkers (The Bridges of Madison County) and somber westerns (the Oscar winning Unforgiven) with equal degrees of thoughtfulness and visual flair. Additionally, Kevin Bacon has gone on record as saying that Eastwood runs \\"the classiest set\\" in Hollywood and is adept at getting complex and engaging performances out of ensemble casts. In the mesmerizing Mystic River, Eastwood uses his considerable talents to tell a haunting and thought-provoking story about the ramifications of violence in a cruel and unjust world. Rather then pummel his audience with gratuitous images of carnage and slaughter, the director has brilliantly analyzed the psychological consequences of aggression and brutality on those who witness it and those who become its victims.  <br /> <br />The story centers on the fates of Jimmy Marcum (Sean Penn), Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), three childhood friends who became distant from one another after David was abducted and raped by two mysterious men. They are brought back together when Jimmy's daughter Katie is brutally murdered outside a bar and Sean (now a police detective) comes to believe that Dave might be a suspect.  <br /> <br />Each of the main characters has been warped and disturbed by violence, and the bulk of the film is devoted to the gripping examination of their defects. Dave's childhood experiences transform him into a listless, despairing \\"zombie\\" who can't find purpose or meaning in his life and is forced to work almost incessantly to keep his suppressed rage at humanity from coming to the surface. Sean has found a more productive calling in law enforcement, but the endless barrage of anger and killings that he encounters in his line of work have made him cold and desensitized to human suffering (tothe point where his wife has left him). To him, the chance to investigate the murder of someone he was at least somewhat acquainted with is an opportunity to re-awaken his human compassion and sensitivity. The death of Jimmy's daughter rekindles the values of his former criminal career, changing him from a mild-mannered family man into a heartbroken avenger who is more than angry enough to harm the former friend who might be responsible for his pain. Penn, Bacon and Robbins each explore every nuance and motivation of their characters with depth and sensitivity, and in a perfect world they would all would have received Oscar nominations. In reality, the subtle resonance of Bacon's characterization was overlooked in favor of the flashier turns by Penn and Robbins.  <br /> <br />The provocative question that Mystic River poses to its audience is whether violence is a legitimate response to other forms of violence that seem to threaten those you love. Sean and his partner Whitey (a charmingly cynical Laurence Fishburne) have devoted their lives to a profession that believes it isn't, but Jimmy's wife Annabeth (the stunning Laura Linney) is more than willing to risk a few dead bodies if it ensures the safety of her children and the stability of her household. Ultimately, it is ability of Mystic River to get average people talking about the justifications for violence and the morality of revenge that guarantees that this film will be regarded as one of the first true masterpieces of new millennium.   <br />
B00005JMAH|3.0|When I heard about The Prisoner of Askaban I was so excited. I could not wait to see it. What a shocker! It did not match my expectations. It was almost as if this movie belonged to someone else instead of the Harry Potter series. However, I still liked it. Dan proves his valor yet again. Along with Rupert and Emma. Unlike the others, this one did not show enough detail. I know that they can't afford to give you too much because of its length. But, COME ON! They just zipped through each scene excepting you to understand what was going on. It was an if they took the most important chunk out of the movie that was essential, according to the book. And, what about their uniforms. Only the teachers were wearing theirs. It's almost like your going against the story itself! How do you know their Hogwarts students? I think the producer should give up now while he has the chance! I did not like how he handled things. The other two were carefully drawn out. You knew what was going on and why. It was nice to see David Thewlis as the good guy for once. The new Dumbledore didn't amaze me ether. He wasn't as lighthearted as the other one, or as talented. Although, he should have had a bigger part. But, the old one was still better. I miss Richard Harris!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br />The ending was still cute. All in all, it was still a good movie. Worth a one time showing. But, it makes me wonder what is in store for the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  <br />  <br />  <br />
B0001O3YD0|4.0|As most of you might know, there's a movie called The Chronicles of Riddick(TCOR). Director David Twohy explains that Pitch Black is an introduction to TCOR trilogy. Think of it this way: the Riddick movies are the futuristic LOTR. The Hobbit introduces us to middle-Earth although it has nothing to do with the LOTR trilogy. It just serves as an introduction to Bilbo Baggins, middle-Earth, and the Ring. Pitch Black is what The Hobbit is to the LOTR. An introduction to the world of the future and to Riddick.  <br /> <br />Story:  <br /> <br />A ship transporting 40 passangers is taking them to a planet called New Mecca. Passengers are in cyro-sleep, a sort of process in which the brain shuts down temporarily until they arrive to New Mecca. There are three pilots who take turns in piloting the ship. The current one dies and the other two wake up from the cyro-sleep when they hear an alarm. While the pilot was dead, the ship crashed with an asteroid road and is now falling into an unknown planet. The ship crashlands leaving only a few of those 40 passangers alive. The survivors are Carolyn Fry; one of the pilots, a Muslim named Imam, Imam's four sons, a woman named Shazza and her brother Zeke, a boy named Jack, an antique collector called Paris, and a cop named Johns who was transporting an escaped convict and murderer whose name is Riddick to prison without the passengers knowing. Fry and Johns are the only ones aware of Riddick, and it gets worse when they find out he broke free because of the crash. So Fry and Johns are forced to let the surviving passengers know about Riddick since he's the most dangerous man in the universe. Not only that, but the planet has three suns and is covered in sand everywhere. They soon find out the hard way that there are alien creatures who only survive in the dark underground the planet and that on that same day a long-lasting pitch black eclipse is going to take place so the creatures will come out for food.  <br /> <br />This story has many twists which I love and it makes you wonder who really is bad in this movie. Riddick's actor Vin Diesel says this movie is \\"human nature in the harshest of situations.\\"  <br /> <br />DVD: <br /> <br />This DVD is the unrated director's cut that also contains never before seen extra footage and special features. Plus it's unrated so gore fans will see quite a few organs of both humans and aliens in this DVD version of the movie. Not to mention tons of blood; also from both human and alien.  <br /> <br />More Riddick recommendations: <br /> <br />If you end up liking this movie as much as I did, then I suggest you watch the 35-minute-long Riddick anime called Dark Fury. Also, watch TCOR too. And you can expect two more Riddick sequels on their way in a few years. <br /> <br />Conclusion: <br /> <br />I gave this DVD four stars because it could've had more and better special features and extra footage. Also, director David Twohy has to practice a bit more on his cliffhangers since both Pitch Black and TCOR have a little bad cliffhangers. Other than that, this movie is excellent.   <br /> <br />Well, that's all I have to say about my favorite sci-fi franchise. Go watch the Riddick films now!
B00005JKC3|1.0|Since I can't read minds, I can't say for sure what Ang Lee was going for in \\"The Hulk.\\" But what I can tell you is that he didn't succeed. This movie was rightly ignored by audiences, even though the critics couldn't praise it enough (as if we needed any further proof that movie critics don't live in the real world). But let's face it, what professional critic would dare to disparage Ang Lee? <br /> <br />I'm a big believer that a movie should be judged on its own merits, not in comparison to what we should have \\"expected\\" from a certain director, actor, etc. So let me now describe The Hulk on its own terms, not in relation to the excellent \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\":  \\"The Hulk\\" is long, boring, flat, uninspired, slow-paced, dark, unmemorable, and it would be depressing if we were ever drawn into the story enough to be depressed by it, which we aren't. The few CGI sequences that the movie attempts are ridiculously cartoon-like and don't fit the overall tone of the movie at all (By contrast, if you want to see minimalistic CGI used to great effect, see Alfonso Cuaron's masterwork, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"). <br /> <br />The CGI Hulk only appears three times in the movie, which in retrospect is three times too many. The rest of the time we're treated to Eric Bana's flat, unsympathetic, and completely uncharismatic portrayal of Bruce Banner, which consists of him mumbling things that are supposed to demonstrate how this movie is a \\"cautionary tale\\" of man's attempts to master the universe through science, or to set up some \\"Shakespearian tragedy\\" in relation to Banner's father (Nick Nolte), who's also the villain Electro-Man or something.  <br /> <br />Some reviewers here who love the movie claim that the rest of us \\"don't get it.\\" Yes, I get the cautionary tale about science (H.G. Wells could teach Ang Lee a lot about these \\"cautionary tales\\") and I get the classical father/son king/prince tragedy (just read Homer or Shakespeare, for goodnesssake). Not only do these themes not work in the movie, but Lee treats them way too seriously for a movie which is supposed to be about a guy who turns into a 50-foot tall green ape when he gets angry (as Bart Simpson would say, \\"At least his shorts stayed on\\"). <br /> <br />I rarely say this, but if you haven't seen this movie, save yourself two-plus hours of your life. I would've walked out of the theater after the first 30 minutes if I didn't have Jennifer Connelly to look at. In retrospect, I should've gone home anyway and watched her in \\"The Hot Spot\\" again. <br />
B00005YU1O|1.0|~ Although this film is hailed by some as &#34;Original&#34; and &#34;Intellectual&#34; After watching it twice, I have to disagree vehemently. It is little more than an inane meandering of thought that attempts to prove various philosophies about Biology/Conciousness/Spacetime relations &tc. while abandoning all forms of organized logic. Although the ideas are presented rapid fire, one must assume from the mindlessly naive conceptual framework, that one is overhearing the excited babble of freshman after their first philosphy course. Although I am not well versed in the subjects of some of the ideas presented in the film, I feel compelled to say that their inferences specifically involving Biology and Physics are fundamentally flawed, (i.e. totally fabricated and presented as truth). Some cite the bewilderment you feel after viewing this movie as one of it's proving points. As if implying &#34;You are just not deep enough to get all it has to say.&#34; I refuse to buy it, a film like this should not ever be taken seriously. It embodies the self gratifying media that feeds a group of coffee table philosophers who regurgitate the latest they have heard NOT learned.
B000002KIK|4.0|The best song on this album is Junior's Eyes, period ! . This is the last Black Sabbath album with the disputably extra-ordinarily shining metal vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Never Say Die is a song, just powerful and solid hard. Johnny Blade is the name of some character. Junior's Eyes , a masterful effort maybe one of a piece of classic at an era where The band fell to pieces at the departure of Ozzy. Listen to Air Dance, it changes its tempo quite often and creates a uniquity in the repertoire. If you are a die-hard or a casual fanatic of the creators of Heavy metal, this album will not let you down. However not comparable to the raw sound of the Paranoid album, though. <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|Hurray for the mexican director, the movie was way better than the first two, it has more feel, its darker, the camera shots are magic! <br />Now, ill have to straight things up upon those that feel that the movie wasnt a match: <br /> <br />To those that complain about the new Hogwarts: Its a LOT better imo, the other one look plain and empty, i love the lakes, the mountains and the more misty theme on this one, its how i imagined when i read the books <br /> <br />Those that complain about new Dumbledore: He was good, as good as Richard Harris, but hell... you just cant rate a movie 1 or 2 cuz an actor died, can you??? <br /> <br />To those that complain about Harry's explosive attitude: God, you cant expect harry to remain as when he was 11, Breaking News: Harry is growing. Personally, i think after all what Harry is living, its quite acceptable to see him over react as he did in the movie, so people dont complain about it... <br /> <br />All the elements of the movie were better than the last 2 films, humor, scenario, actors. Tho i must agree that an extra 15 minutes to the movie to explain things that might confuse non-readers would have made it even better. So i take a star out of this cuz i know the movie can be hard for those that didnt read the book. But dont blame the director.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Oh, I love this movie! The costumes are really great, especially Roses. 5 stars, and it's really worth it too. The music is fantastic. I listen to it everytime i watch the movie (wich could be many times a week).  <br />But the greatest thing I love in this movie, is Roses and Jacks love for each other. It's so great, that they don't care what other people thinks. Kate is a really talented actress (Leo too!), and watch her (and him!) in a movie like Titanic is just too good to be true! But it is true.   <br />
B0000025D0|5.0|1978's \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" is Springsteen at the top of his form. He had two brilliant albums just before this (\\"The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle\\" and \\"Born to Run\\") and two brilliant albums after it (\\"The River\\" and \\"Nebraska\\"), any one of which would be a career-topping achievement for almost any other musician. But with \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" Springsteen reaches higher; in my mind, this is one of the single greatest accomplishments in recorded music, along with \\"After the Gold Rush\\" by Neil Young.    In \\"E Street Shuffle\\" and \\"Born to Run,\\" Springsteen created lush musical landscapes for his stories about losers (\\"Incident on 57th Street,\\" \\"Jungleland\\"). The difference on \\"Darkness\\" is that the music is more urgent, more driving, less abstract, and the stories here are about ordinary people being crushed by life's realities, not about the Romeo-and-Juliet characters from Bruce's two preceding albums.     Listening to \\"Darkness\\" takes work, it's emotionally exhausting, it's not like a Beatles CD (though I love the Beatles) that you can pop into the car stereo on a road trip. Even a simple, two-minute, mid-tempo song like \\"Factory\\" resonates with a raw emotional power I've only heard before in classical music. There are no \\"party\\" songs like \\"Rosalita\\" or \\"Sherry Darling\\" on \\"Darkness,\\" but each of this album's ten songs will grip you and won't let go. I'd say that the only weak spot on the album is the closing title track, which seems anticlimactic; but that may just be me. A hundred years from now, English majors could be studying these songs, just like they'll be studying Bob Dylan.

B0001I55OC|1.0|I do not have much to add, all my fellow reviewers that rated this movie 1 star and below have said it all. But i must say that no other movie that has motivated to the extent that i had to log on the internet after i finished viewing it and do the little bit i can to save the rest of the world from wasting there time on even considering this \\"movie\\" as as something worth there time. <br />
B00005JMAH|3.0|If you are expecting the new Harry Potter movie to be like the first two...you are WRONG. I wouldn't quite call it bad, but I think if Chris Columbus would've directed this one as well, then it would have been MUCH better. I did not enjoy the \\"darkness\\" of the film. There were very few light or comical moments in this one, aside from when Hermione punches Draco Malfoy. Go Hermione!! Also, I absolutely did NOT care for the new Dumbledore. They didn't even try to make him resemble the original Professor Dumbledore. Even the demeanor of the character is different. Overall...I'd say mediocre, but the special effects are still good.
1573225517|4.0|I thought this book was a great read. Entertaining, fast-paced, insightful. It's basically the story of a not completely likable guy, who has just gone through a bad breakup, and is going back to see the five girls he considers to have been his worst breakups to figure out what's wrong with him. Funny stuff happens. Even some sappy stuff, which was tolerable. I liked the movie a lot when I saw it years ago, but when I watched it after reading the book, it wasn't as good.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have been a Christian since I was 7 yrs old, however I like many strayed from Gods chosen path.  When I saw this movie I was not only moved to tears but found my life changing in the most wonderful of ways! I prayed for forgiveness of my sins again because all of what Jesus endured, he endured for us. He didn't have to, ya know? And I now have the blessed assurance that I will go to Heaven!  Amen! This movie is very graphic but the graphics are uterly necessary if we are to grasp the truth of what Christ endured for all of us.  I hope that you will see this film and that Christ's journey will have a profound impact in your life as well!  God Bless!
B0002I831S|5.0|If I could only have one TV Series on DVD, this would be it. <br />It's the original Star Trek, nothing more need be said. <br /> <br />If you bought the whole series before on DVD, don't buy this <br />one if you don't want to, but don't have a cow about it <br />either.  Things changes, prices changes and items are  <br />discontinued or repackaged.  You got what you paid for <br />at the time, and that's all you paid for (you didn't get <br />an agreement from Paramount to never release *their* <br />product ever again)!
B0002HTZJI|5.0|This is by far the best live band thats out today and maybe of all time everyone needs to see them some time before they die I have seen them 7 times in concert and after hearing this i cant wait for them to come around again I have been obsessed with them for who knows how long but that is another story, anyways if you like rock music or funk music or just music in general you need to buy this live album. John Frusciante is one of the greatest guitar players of all time probably top 5 of all time and he pretty much shows it in these concerts,I love the new tracks(Rolling Sly Stone,Leverage of Space)so much I cant wait for the next album I also cant say that I am upset that they didnt put pre-californication tracks because I love all there music so much and they play the songs on here so good that you probably wont even think about them so it doesnt even matter. So go out buy this double disk masterpiece or buy the red hot chili peppers dvd live at the slane casle or just do yourself a favor and buy them both I am telling everyone now this band is going to get just as big as the rolling stones or led zepplin some day just wait it will happen
0802130208|5.0|According to a New Republic quote on the book jacket, A Confederacy of Dunces is \\"one of the funniest books ever written.\\" And it was funny. Certainly Ignatius Riley, the main character, is one of the more memorable and strange characters I can remember. He's an overweight mustached intellectual with years of college training and no interpersonal skills. He's a slob, arrogant, cruel to his mother, eccentric and overly dramatic. Chaos trails him like the wake of an ocean liner. Yet for some reason you find yourself liking him, perhaps because the other characters he deals with all have their own glaring flaws. An unconventional story, with many impossible-to-predict curves.<br /><br />This, amazingly and unfortunately, was Toole's first and only book. As a writer and avid reader of fiction, this is both maddening and saddening.
B00020HEG6|5.0|As both a classical musician and a huge Harry Potter fan (of both the books and the movies), I truly enjoyed John Williams's contribution to the Prisoner of Azkaban.  For me, the soundtrack of a movie is as important as the screenplay, acting, and cinematography.  Music can either kill or enhance the mood that the film is trying to communicate to the audience.  In Prisoner of Azkaban, the music brilliantly and consistently does the latter.   <br /> <br />It is evident that John Williams paid close attention to both the big picture (no pun intended) and the nuances that Alfonso Cuarn hoped to convey in the third Harry Potter film.  As you likely know, the tone of the story of Harry's third year is darker and more complicated than that of his first two years.  There were moments of bittersweet reflection, such as Lupin's reminiscence of Harry's parents, as well as moments of sheer beauty, such as the conjuring of the patronus that saved Harry and Sirius from the dementors.  But at the same time, there were many fantastic moments of comic relief, such as Aunt Marge's unfortunate, but well-deserved, incident, the snowball fight between an invisible Harry and his unsuspecting nemesis trio, and Harry's deranged journey on the Knight Bus.  John Williams does an excellent job of bringing life to each of those scenes through his diverse and imaginative score. <br /> <br />I appreciate that this soundtrack, instead of being constrained by the previous two, reflected the changes in mood and tone that the new director brought to this film.  It takes a highly talented and flexible composer to pull that off, and John Williams stepped up to the challenge.  (See, for example, Leonard Bernstein's influence in the Knight Bus track!) <br /> <br />For the record, my favorite tracks are (2) Aunt Marge's Waltz, (6) Buckbeak's Flight, (7) A Window to the Past, and (21) Mischief Managed! (a medley of all of the major themes).  <br />
B00005JMXX|2.0|THE PREVIEWS FROM THE WERE MOVIE OVERRATED IT MORE THAN IT SHOULD HAD BEEN. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP ON THE MOVIE A COUPLE OF TIMES. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE NONE STOP ACTION BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE A TYPICAL MOVIE LIKE SUM OF ALL FEARS OR DEEP IMPACT. IT WAS ALOT OF TALKING AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE ACTION IS OVER AND BACK TO TALKING AGAIN. I WOULD GO SEE IT IN THE MOVIES OR RENT IT BECAUSE ITS NOT WORTH YOU BUYING IT. ONCE YOU SEE IT ONCE THERE IS NO NEED TO SEE IT AGAIN SO PLEASE DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THSI MOVIE.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril comes back with a smashing album. I loved Let Go, but this was way better. It was more rock style than her first album,and also more mature.

0140288503|5.0|One of the best non-fiction books I've ever read. It covers the 36-hour conflict between U.S. Marines and Special Forces and virtually the entire Somali city of Mogadishu that took place in 1993 when two U.S. Black Hawk Helicopters were shot down, something I knew absolutely nothing about. Bowden describes the battle from both sides, as well as the politics surrounding it. Does a great job of making the soldiers human. A tragic story. The movie, which was good, didn't touch the book.
B000003TAR|5.0|This album is brilliant, I have never seen such a diversity between two albums by the same artist before. \\"Teenage angst has paid off well\\", what a great opening line, its not really what the typical listener would expect after that dreadful day on April 8th '94 when we were announced the horrible news that Kurt Cobain was dead. This album may be sad, depressing and a tear-jerker for some, but it reveals a rawer, grungier side to Nirvana that you wouldn't see in their previous albums. There is also more complexity here than in 'Nevermind' and the guitar solos have vastly improved. Songs like \\"Heart-shaped Box\\" and \\"Rape Me\\" show how brilliant of a musician and vocalist Kurt was, and also shows that Krist is a much better bassist than one would think. Dave Grohls drumming is top notch here and unlike 'Nevermind', these songs never, ever get old. \\"All Apologies\\" also reveals some kind of a tribute to Kurts very first influences, The Beatles, with \\"All in all is all we owe\\" approaching a type of John Lennon song. Overall this album is a huge improvement from 'Nevrmind' (not that 'Nevermind' is a bad album, its actually one of the greatest) and this is definately a top 5 in the greatest rock albums of all time.    Perfect Songs (10/10): Heart-shaped Box, All Apologies, Rape Me, Serve the Servents, Milk It, Very Ape, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter    Superior Songs (9/10): Scentless Apprentice, Pennyroyal Tea, Dumb, Frances Farmer will have her Revnge on Seattle    Great Songs (8/10): tourettes
B00005JMAH|5.0|By far the best of the films to date.  These books are maturing, as are the films.  Gone is all the fluff, and the sense of fun and awe that is so much a part of a new student's world in a new school.. this movie correctly depics the children at home at the school and becoming a part of not only that world but a part of what is happening beyond the school.  What is missing from the film was not necessary to depict where this story is going.. sure more could have been put into it, fluff, story arcs, cute moments.. but the essense, and the important parts are all there, and this movie shines on it's own merits as both a story and a piece of art. <br />

0679720200|4.0|I was reading this on the subway and a drunk guy in his twenties started asking me why I was reading it, if I was looking for truth. I know why he was asking. This is the kind of book you take to the coffee shop if you want to seem smart. People put it on their bookshelves because it's \\"intellectual.\\"<br /><br />THE STRANGER is supposedly one of the great examples of existentialism and a great piece of literature. I don't know anything about existentialism, so I'll have to comment on the second part. It was a good, quick read. A character who is memorable in that he doesn't care about anything. In the end of the story he stands trial for murder, but the trial ends up being not of his actions, but of his character. It makes a point about what defines us as humans and what is required of us to keep that label.
B0000640SA|5.0|I read an extremely detailed review, with explicit spoilers, before seeing this film-- but still enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's the most original concept in film-making in recent years. <br /> <br />The acting, camera-work and set-dressing don't make much impact, although-- to give credit where credit is due-- the realism in wardrobe, set-dressing, and dialogue is extremely well done. <br /> <br />What sets this movie apart is the intricacy of the editing.  It's filmed in such a way that you'll thoroughly enjoy \\"making an evening of it\\" by inviting friends to watch the film, then discuss the plot afterward, over a long dinner.  Bonus points if you can figure out who the bad guy is, and a half-dozen other major plot points-- but DAMN, you'll have a fun time debating & puzzling over it. <br /> <br />IMPORTANT:  Other reviews have (incorrectly) said that the film's sequences are shown backward.  This is not true.  Or rather, it's only half-true.  The film is made up of a series of 5-minute segments.  Half of them (let's call them M, N, O, P, ... Z) are shot in black and white, while the other half (let's call them A, B, C, D, E...K, L) appear in color.  The black-and-white segments are shown in reverse order (Z, Y, X, ...) and are interwoven with the color segments, which happen in chronological order (A, B, C...).  The result is a bit confusing:  The segments are shown in \\"A, Z, B, Y, C, X, D, W, E...\\" order. <br /> <br />This interesting use of editing and sequence lets us completely enter the confusing world of the main character, who's unable to form new memories, and so, can't remember anything for longer than 5 minutes.  It also helps to keep us guessing about major plot points. <br /> <br />Keep your eyes open for logical conflicts and what look like continuity errors, in the main character's oldest memories.  These apparent errors are particularly revealing, and closely model the way a real memory works:  impoerfectly remembering things, and hiding painful memories while editing & altering memories.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|First - it's not Moulin Rouge (a movie that I do happen to love in it's own right.)  So if you're looking for big names, huge show-stopping scenes, elaborate costumes...well, you won't find it in this movie. <br /> <br />What will you find?  A sweet movie with humor, fun, and some good dance scenes.  It's a little quirky - this is Baz - but it's its quirkiness that makes it a rare jewel.   <br /> <br />I saw this movie years ago and fell instantly in love with it.  I've recommended it to countless people over the years.  Even my husband - who is not a huge fan of musicals - enjoys this movie.  But for him, it's more for the interesting directorial choices than the dance scenes.   <br /> <br />I've been a fan of this film for probably ten years now, and no matter how many times I've seen it, I still enjoy it thoroughly.   <br /> <br />

B000002GQE|5.0|1967's _Days Of Future Passed_ is an important recording in the history of popular music indeed, and many have been influenced by it. But, more importantly, it's simply a splendidly beautiful album to listen to, and very hard to *not* be moved by. While this album was reported to be inspired by The Beatles' _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ of the same year (then again, nearly everyone in the music business, and otherwise, became inspired by said album, and The Beatles, in general), in it's original conception stages, it was set to be recorded as a rock-oriented interpretation of Czech composer Dvorak's 9th (\\"From The New World\\") symphony in E minor. But, in what was probably the smartest move, the boys decided to do away with that idea, and come up with an album of all-original material: to write their *own* rock symphony, to an extent. To top it all off, they even decided to embed this gorgeous album with a small concept: the going on's from day to night.<br /><br />An orchestral rock delight, indeed, The Moody Blues are sided with The London Festival Orchestra (conducted by Peter Knight), whose contributions help to enhance the beauty, color, texture and drama of The Moodies'...beautiful, colorful, textured and dramatic music. While many of the orchestral treatments featured here are used as *interludes*, it should be noted that The Moodies' music naturally retains an orchestral flavor throughout, whether it be from the mellotron splashes, or from the orchestral strings. From the dramatic, multi-faceted opening of \\"The Day Begins,\\" to the closing, haunting beauty of \\"Nights In White Satin,\\" the album is an ever-evocative, dreamy, lush, elegant, romantic trip for the senses. Euphoria, contemplation, whimsy, melancholy.. the Moodies live up to their name, as each of these *moods* are here, and then some. I should mention that \\"Dawn Is A Feeling\\" is simply one of the most gorgeous songs I've ever heard, anywhere. In some songs, you'll even find traces of exotic Eastern music (\\"The Sunset\\"), while others simply have a hard-driving rhythm (\\"Peak Hour\\").<br /><br />A classic that influenced many (as listed above), this is recommended for music fans who have a taste for the romantic, dreamy and elegant. In general, anything from The Moody Blues is recommended for those who find that they crave things exhibiting the above attributes, or for fans who love 60s rock.tic Eastern music (\\"The Sunset\\"), while others simply have a hard-driving rhythm (\\"Peak Hour\\"). <br /> <br />A classic that influenced many (as listed above), this is recommended for music fans who have a taste for the romantic, dreamy and elegant.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|The writers and directors completely blew it.  They started with a neat concept in The Matrix, then soiled it, dumbed it down, dissipated it, launched it into brick-wall-stupid plot points, and left us gasping on the ground like goldfish from a broken bowl. <br /> <br />Worst were the obvious stupidities, like all the characters suddenly BELIEVING the enemy, and being able to agree to a peace based on that trust.  HUH ?!?!?!  The BEST PART of the original Matrix movie was the overwhelming, driving \\"Borg\\"-like feeling of despair and relentless, heartless machinery-- a feeling of inescapable entrapment under the almightly power & unflinching inhumanity of the Matrix & its machines.  WHY GIVE THAT UP in exchange for ...childish faith & nonsense ?  All the characters suddenly believing in one anothers' honesty, and declaring a peace, is like beliving that Nixon, Stalin and Mao Tse Tung will one day reincarnate, and be found in bed together reading (and believing) stories about the tooth fairy, Santa, and the Easter Bunny.  *koff-koff* <br /> <br />Other deep flaws are the stupid and unnecessary bits of Matrix-like superpowers outside the Matrix.  Like the addition of werewolves in \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", this is needless dissipation of the core reality presented in Matrix #1. <br /> <br />This franchise could have gone on forever, if it'd been treated right.  \\"Animatrix\\" showed that prequels, sequels, and in-between-quels done by other writers & directors can be VERY satisfying... but now thet we've seen \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\", the whole storyverse of \\"The Matrix\\" becomes a useless, pitiful wad, like rained-on, drooled-on, pulped-and-punched-with holes, stepped-on Kleenex tissue.

B000003S09|5.0|There's not much to be said about the debut of King Crimson that hasn't already been said previously. After a somewhat disasterous collaboration with Michael and Peter Giles, Robert Fripp moved on to create the original lineup of the constantly changing entity that is King Crimson. Michael Giles stayed on as the drummer, Ian McDonald added saxaphone and keyboards, Peter Sinfield wrote the lyrics that were sung by Greg Lake, who also played bass while Fripp manned guitar and mellotron. This would be the only release by this outfit,  as Greg Lake departed shortly afterward to be a part of Emerson, Lake and Palmer.  <br /> <br />In the Court of the Crimson King is arguably the first true progressive rock album, kickstarting a genre that would be inhabited by Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull and ELP among others. It's no suprise that the album had such a strong effect on the musical landscape. The opener, the blistering \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is the most readily recognizable song of the Krims' catalogue, and easily their most popular. The opening riff bleeding into top notch vocal work from Greg Lake is simply a warm up for the absolute craziness of the bridge, a long, free form jazz infused noodle of scary complexity and complete psychosis. I cannot fathom how these guys pulled off such a feat without fiendish overdubbing. It's a masterpiece from beginning to end, and one of the most powerful ways to open an album in the history of music. <br /> <br />The second song of five, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" is a mellow, breezy ballad that can't mask the trite nature of Peter Sinfield's lyrics, though the pure power of Greg Lake's voice makes it a little more bearable. It's a flighty tune without much substance, but a solid break from the assault of \\"Schizoid Man.\\" <br /> <br />At the album's center is the best song the Krims have ever recorded, \\"Epitaph.\\" The epic feel of the song is nearly unparalelled, and while the lyrics are a bit on the pretentious side, this is the best vocal performance in the history of rock music. Greg Lake's performance here is so powerful and passionate that it reaches a completely different level. <br /> <br />\\"Moonchild,\\" the fourth of five songs, is the album's only weak link. It starts out on a promising note, but then lapses into the one great pitfall of the progressive genre, over-experimentation.  The noodling lacks the structure of the bridge of \\"Schizoid Man,\\" and gets tiresome incredibly quickly. Normally, this wouldn't be horrible, but you get to deal with TWELVE MINUTES of it. If they had made the song into a ballad with a darker tone, this album would be absolute perfection. <br /> <br />The album ends with the title track, a nine minute epic and the most indulgent song the Krims ever produced. And it's fantastic. So thoroughly pretentious in its lyrics and mellotron lines, it's saved by the epic power of the chorus.  <br /> <br />In the Court of the Crimson King contains three of the most powerful songs in the history of progressive rock, one solid ballad and one overindulgent piece of trite. Those three songs alone are enough to make this one of the best albums ever written, and it's no wonder so many bands, some good (Peter Gabriel era Genesis, most of ELP and Jethro Tull's catalogues, Yes' Fragile) and some bad (Phil Collins' butchering of Genesis, most of Yes and the atrocity that is Rush), used this as a stepping stone. King Crimson revolutionized progressive rock with this album, and to this day it still hasn't been topped.
B000067UUJ|4.0|If you're seriously considering buying this album, your main question should be &quot;Is it worth the 30-some dollars HMV is asking?&quot; The answer is both yes and no. <br />Disc one is Muse's B-sides, some of which deserve to be album tracks, or in the case of Hyper Chondriac Music, singles. Besides that song, the best on here are Map of Your Head, Shrinking Universe (another potential single) and Forced In.<br />Disc two, however, is where things get interesting. Most likely, you've heard/bought Absolution, and perhaps stolen a few mp3s of previous Muse albums(especially Origin of Symmetry). However difficult it may seem, the studio is NOT Muse's best part (although amazing). THAT, is reserved for their live show. I mean, earlier in the year, Matt (lead vocals/guitar) accidentlly hit himself in the face while playing in Canada for one of the first times. At times like Dead Star and Agitated (which open and close the album respectively) you can practically hear this man rocking out like no other. <br />This concert was wayyyyyy before Absolution, so there is no &quot;Time is Running Out&quot;. However, Muse do a large portion of Origin of Symmetry, with a few oldies thrown in, plus 2 new tracks (which were the singles off this album), Dead Star and In Your World.<br />Overall, I recommend this if you're a hardcore Muse fan...but if you ARE a hardcore Muse fan, just search online and buy a DVD of this concert, and watch Muse show you why they put out a live album in the first place!<br />and, because amazon/hmv haven't done this...<br />DISC ONE TRACKLISTING (B-Sides)<BR>Forced In<BR>Shrinking Universe<BR>Recess<BR>Yes Please<BR>Map Of Your Head<BR>Nature_1<BR>Shine Acoustic<BR>Ashamed<BR>The Gallery<BR>Hyper Chondriac Music<br />DISC TWO TRACKLISTING (Live Concert)<BR>Dead Star<BR>Micro Cuts<BR>Citizen Erased<BR>Showbiz<BR>Megalomania<BR>Dark Shines<BR>Screenager<BR>Space Dementia<BR>In Your World<BR>Muscle Museum<BR>Agitated
B00005JLWN|2.0|From start to finish, this film is a \\"wannabe\\".  There are no big stars, and no major special effects.  The much-touted \\"Gun Kata\\" fight sequences were wooden (Christian Bale is NO MARTIAL ARTS GURU-- the man is as inflexible as a concrete pier piling) and laughably unvelievable. <br /> <br />The \\"gun kata\\" which is supposed to intrigue us is described as \\"martial arts based on positioning your body where the bullets are least likely to be, based on an analysis of thousands of gun battles\\".  In practice, however, this laughably stoooopid \\"Gun Kata\\" amounts to Christian Bale standing in the same place, absolutely rigid from the shoulders down, standing in stark relief illuminated by a room's only lightsource, while a handful of guys fire at him with with automatic weapons.  He should have more holes in him than Sponge Bob Squarepants (tm).  When asked to suspend my disbelief, I just fell over on the couch and laughed myself slly...until I realized that I'd PAID to watch this.  Then, I felt like crying for those little, lost bucks that coulda bought pepsi & popcorn instead. <br /> <br />We're also asked to believe that heavily armed & well-trained police officers will gather in a tight circle around a suspect, and start firing.  *ahem*.  Ain't they gonna shoot one another ?  Is there ANY reason they don't ? <br /> <br />There's also a HUGE gap in plot-logic, when we're shown a character's flashback about a gun-switch.  It's simply...not possible that the gun switch happened when he think it did, and this point is never resolved in a logical way. <br /> <br />Consider this whole thing an also-ran, loser rip-off of The Matrix...kinda like Matrix 2 & Matrix 3, without the SFX budget & Keanu Reeves.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I bought this album many years ago, when as a young guitarist, I was trying to develop a style that blended hard rock with jazz fusion. The influence this album had on my playing is beyond description. I literally wore out every groove absorbing the sheer mastery of Jeff Beck's playing. Now getting this re-mastered CD version and putting it on my stereo brought all those memories back. <br /> <br />For my money, Jeff Beck is one of the greatest guitar players on this earth. And this may be his best effort ever. His playing on this album is so focused that it sends chills down my spine. The absolute highlight would have to be \\"Cause We've Ended as Lovers\\". Jeff's solo just builds and builds to a climax with each bar more powerful than the previous. <br /> <br />It is no surprise to me that many amazing guitar players with such diverse styles as Steve Lukather, Mike Stern, Brett Mason, Tony McAlpine, and George Lynch worship Jeff. As much as I admire Clapton, Page, and Hendrix, Beck is my favorite rock guitarist of all time.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement's \\"Slanted & Enchanted\\". I'll be realistic, I didn't listen to this record in 1992. Actually, no, I just stumbled onto this band about two years ago. But, as I did grow up in the '90s, I notice how baffling it is, how much pop-rock/alt. rock bands copied this sound; if this album was properly produced and was a tad more cohesive, this would've gone platinum. Part of what makes it such a great record, though, is its gross, messy, sound. Bands like Weezer strived to recreate that sound, but for the most part failed. Even if you hate indie rock, get this album, just because it's a piece of history. The opening song, \\"Summer Babe [Winter Ver.]\\", is every good rock song in the '90s put into three minutes.
6305132984|4.0|West Side Story is an version of Romeo and Juliet by Shakespears. Natalie Wood starred as Maria in the movie and Richard Beymer starred as Tony as Maria's devoted lover. The movie take place in the 1950s at New York. Maria's brother Bernado is the head of a gang named \\"Shark\\" and Tony's friend, Riff, is the head of another gang named \\"Jets.\\" The two gangs doesn't get along very well. Maria and Tony met at a party and they were love at first sight but their familys and friends won't let them be together. Maria was a Puerto Rican and Tony was pure American. They were races back in the 1950s. This is a very great music/drama movie. Singing songs to express their feelings is a very cool thing. If present people still do that people would not likely to watch it because teeangers and adults these days like new things. Singing songs while playing in the movie is not a things people would want to see but if they really get into that movie they will think it's not that bad. i think i like this movie because it brings lots of romance and gangs like thing about the 1950s. Whenever there's a gang happening there's always some romance going on. That's what people like to see now.
