B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best superHero movie ever, and at a great price, go Amazon! I KOW THERE has been great movies before and we have seen them evolve. This has become my all time favorite movie.
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|This game is challenging but fun. There aren't many helicopter games out there so this is great to have on Android. I found the controls to be pretty realistic and not too difficult. Great graphics and cool concept of flying RC choppers, reminds me of the Micro Machines games from several years ago.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Used it for about a month.  Find it a great tool for planning my day.  Also great to plan trips since I can change locations without a problem.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Just like every Mayer album, it takes a little getting used to, but I'm already hooked. Worth the purchase for sure.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I loved it! Great sound! I bought it as a gift to my husband, he loves blues, so was the best gift ever!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a very fun game. Can become slightly repetitive. It needs more variety in upgrades. All in all, it's a fun game to pass the time.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Well-developed plot, amazingly likable characters.  Wife and I don't really watch animated movies anymore, but the previews for the new Despicable Me 2 movie intrigued us enough to give it a go.  Had to watch the original first obviously... and we were laughing the entire time.  Strongly recommend for anyone who wants a clever, family-friendly movie.  Only reason I didn't give five stars I because: 1) improvement is always possible; and 2) I had never even heard of this franchise until the new commercials on TV for the second movie piqued my curiosity (meaning they could have done a better job marketing the first one).
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is a pretty Fun game. Just like the old Atari game missile command that I played as a kid.....
193700788X|2.0|Sorry, but I won't be buying this book from Amazon. As the last book the characters were twisted to fit the plot, the ending was rushed and the ending was Such a great disappointment.<br />In fact I won't be buying the book that wraps the series up either. Don't really need to give Ms Harris any more money.<br />You can read some really good reviews here that detail the problems with this book, so I will just say..too bad.

B009LDD54K|5.0|I had heard that the series was good...but I had no idea just how good. It's simply great. The acting is wonderful and despite the violence I can't wait for the next episode....it's my reward.
B00BTYFWEA|5.0|An amazing movie for those who have some sort of sense of humor and especially great for lovers of German culture or Val Kilmer.

B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I have watched most drama series and found this one to be...terrific. The casting is amazing and I just can't wait for the next season to become available.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|It had its moments.  I just don't think it lives up to the first one and you come to parts like too much repeat of the first one.  It was just okay.
B000SNW0HA|5.0|This is great for working out or just lounging at home or if you wanna get into a hardcore trance! Great music anytime!
B009AMAGXK|4.0|I loved the books so wanted to get the movie.  It was ok, but somewhat disappointing on how it was so different in many ways to the book.  It almost felt like they try to put all three books into one movie.  Shipping was good though.
B005VMSATA|5.0|Excellent Movie to see with the whole family<br />I recomment this movie to see with the home theater. Thanks !
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|I have to admit, I'm not one of those in my generation that thrives on the internet and other gadgets like tablets and  smart phones (though I do use a cell phone a lot), so maybe it's just part of my semi-old-fashioned take on some things that prevented me from fully appreciating the storm of special-effects used in this movie.  I liked the black and white start to the movie, and the sudden transition to color in Oz, but I believe the computerized effects were majorly over-used.  First, before I incur sneering from someone who is a fan and is in the tech world, I, too, am heavily involved in the tech world currently, including doing programming.  And I like special effects—especially compared to some goofy costumes and other effects that were used back in the day.  But special effects have their limit—over-used, just like a character in a movie who can throw in funny one-liners, can become just plain annoying.  Pretty soon I felt like I was watching a computer-animated movie, like A Bug’s Life, but worse than that (I like computer animated movies, but I like live-action movies when that’s what I expect), the computer effects actually managed to distract me from the plot line.  It’s like an artist who is so enthralled with being able to do one kind of stroke, or paint one certain object (like a dog) well, that they focus too much on that and ruin the rest of the painting, or make all their paintings look too-alike for someone who wants a variety, yet likes the artist’s style.<br />*Spoiler alert here*  Second, aside from the background and scenery and sometimes computer-animated characters, I was a bit disappointed in character development, and sometimes what felt like a lack of reasoning for why a character acted the way they did, as well as it taking too long for the main character, Oz, to morph into a moral guy.  Now, I do believe that the directors/screenwriters/etc. did a good job for reasoning why the first witch that Oz meets eats the apple her sister provides.  But why is that first mean sister so mean in the first place?  And how does she manage to trick the other sister; though that sister is a bit naïve, is she really dumb, too?  And besides that, I was actually depressed by the fact that the sister who becomes the wicked witch of the west went from a charming, happy, go-lucky, naïve girl who quickly develops a crush on Oscar “aka” Oz, into a terribly wicked person who hates Oz and wants to destroy him and her own good sister, even to the shock of the first mean sister.  I guess I’m the sort of person who always hopes that even the bad characters will show remorse at some point (such as Darth Vader in Star Wars).  I do like how the good sister, who remains good, really sees through Oz unlike her naïve sister, yet still thinks he can be a good guy and help stop her mean sister.  And I would be lying if I said I didn’t like the romance, more obvious at the end, between the good sister and Oz.<br />Overall, The Great and Powerful Oz is fun to watch and has a happy ending that includes the a few clever tie-ins to the beginning characters in Kansas (I recall something about a trained monkey…), similar to the good old Wizard of Oz movie.  But it sometimes gets you lost in computer-effects and may disappoint you as well—I mean, gosh, shouldn’t someone who’s naïve and only sees the best in people still be good at the end?  It stinks, in my opinion, that she is the one who seems to be the meanest at the end, with no hope of changing back in sight (unless the screenwriters for subsequent films intend to pull a Darth Vader moment at some point, unlike what is shown in The Wizard of Oz).  Perhaps I just feel sorry for her in this movie, unlike in The Wizard of Oz, because I saw how she was before.<br />Maybe the plot parts I don’t like actually come from Frank Baum, the writer of the Oz books, and not the screenwriters, I don’t know.<br />Anyway, this review is getting too long and could turninto a screenplay itself of how I would have liked the story to go, if I keep on going.  But since re-writes are not my thing, only writing new material, I must sign-off.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|This week's blues artist is the Texas Albino Guitar Slinger himself Johnny Winter. He has a dynamite blues album out called Roots. He plays guitar, Lead, and Rhythm to some pretty impressive guests (Warren Hayes, Sonny Landreth, John Popper, Vince Gill, (Brother) Edgar Winter, and many others), and Plays some mighty tasty licks from the way back machine (Further On Up The Road, Done Somebody Wrong, T-Bone Shuffle, etc.) This is an Incredibly Great album. Even though he (and his brother) have to be in their late 60's / early 70's, don't get them ready for a rocking chair yet. Johnny continues to put down some of the finest Texas Blues ever. If you want some really good blues, this is the one to get.  Tastier than a Texas Barbecue, And just as rewarding, but without the heartburn. :)
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was so good and the ending was not anything that I thought it would be, I would recommend it to everyone

B0081JPTCQ|4.0|There's lots of functionality and options in this note app and I had fun playing around with it, BUT it's complicated and not intuitive. There are instructions in the app if you press the \\"?\\" icon which will give you several pages of how-to information. There is also a link to several youtube videos about how to use the app. The convoluted way you get the add-ons is pretty annoying. There are no pop up ads or in-app purchases but there are links to a variety of add-ons some of which are free and others that cost $0.99.  Many of these add-ons have gotten poor reviews because it is not clear that they depend on owning this app or [[ASIN:B007XWNWBC Handy Note Pro]](Fire optimitized version) $3.99 or [[ASIN:B0091OL5HS Notes on Life Pro]] $4.99<br /><br />Contrary to what I read in another review the app CAN be used with wi-fi off, but don't expect to be able to move things to drop box or e-mail them unless you have a wi-fi connection. I was able to create diary and note pages, importing picture or adding on the fly photos & smilie icons to them, then create text boxes and enter text using either the pull down keyboard or with a stylus or by writing with my finger on the screen. Everything can be re-sized, repositioned, erased and deleted. There's a choice of fonts, font sizes, pens, widths and colors. When choosing what kind of notebook to open (blank, notes, diary, minutes, planner, etc) the screen often flips between portrait and landscape despite my having my screen locked into landscape orientation.<br /><br />While creating schedules & certain entries felt kind of flip floppy to me(a lot of going back and forth), it may be because I expect never to have to read instructions and that all icons are self explanatory. This app has lots of little icons and while I did find this a bit frustrating, they really give you tons of options on how to customize almost everything. This is the kind of app that you have to invest some time in to learn. There is a whole long scrolling screen of general settings (you should at least look at these before you start-->settings wheel at bottom right of screen) as well as many other setting that you adjust while using the app.<br /><br />One thing I did really like was how easy it was to switch between writing with my finger/stylus and then going to the keyboard when I needed to type in something very precisely like an e-mail address/key code/customer name to make sure it is absolutely clear. It was also very easy to place a date or time stamp quickly(current or future date/time). If you don't like using text boxes, the blank template with a predefined pen in free drawing mode using 2 finger scrolling worked well for taking fast notes or drawing pictures/diagrams.<br /><br />These are the free template packs that work with this app:<br />[[ASIN:B00A17MC6C ResPack 01- Free Notebook]]<br />[[ASIN:B00A0EMXHO ResPack 02- Free Photo Book]]<br />[[ASIN:B00A48S2D0 ResPack 03- Free Diary]]<br />[[ASIN:B00ABFKN1A ResPack 05- Christmas]]<br />[[ASIN:B00AFV9K32 ResPack 04- Christmas Album]] (Photo frames)<br /><br />I tested this on a Kindle Fire HD 7\\" and it worked fine. It seems designed to work best for short notes/reminders as it uses a lot a screen real estate. This is a powerful app that has everything including the kitchen sink thrown in. Despite the many reviews that are down rating this for permissions(I think the bookmarks permission may refer to the bookmarks you set in this app itself), lack of instructions, frustration factor, this seems to be a very useful app with good potential and I plan to spend some time learning how to use it. It has a definite learning curve but the things it can do and how fast it can do them are pretty amazing to me.<br /><br />The only things I haven't yet been able to figure out how to do is zoom a page(no pinch to zoom that I can find) and I don't see that you can print directly to a printer which would have been nice.<br /><br />The app isn't perfect and it's certainly not for everyone but it's definitely worth trying out.<br /><br />Note 1: This app is probably best for tablets as there is a lot being displayed on the screen that may be hard to see/read/select on smaller phones.<br /><br />Note 2: There are no in-app purchases. You have to select the \\"?\\" then choose \\"Our Products\\" to even see what the add-ons are. And if I missed one, if you have airplane mode \\"On\\" this disables the wireless setting.<br /><br />Note 3: Used on a Kindle Fire I don't see any of the permissions as a problem, but more consideration and investigation should be used with this app when downloading it to a phone which contains your personal information.ly not for everyone but it's definitely worth trying out.<br /><br />Note 1: This app is probably best for tablets as there is a lot being displayed on the screen that may be hard to see/read/select on smaller phones.<br /><br />Note 2: There are no in-app purchases.

B000JMKRKC|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author captures the essence of the characters and winds them all together in this little mystery and even has a happy ending.
0316017930|1.0|I have wasted enough time on this book, but it annoyed me enough to write a review.  Here are some compelling reasons to delve into something else you have been thinking about reading.<br /><br />1. It is dull, pretentious, and phony.  I kept waiting for it to getter better.  It didn't.  In fact, by the end of the book, I was actually a little pissed off.<br /><br />2. This book contradicts itself.  Which is it?  Outliers are the result of good luck or 10,000 hours of practice.<br /><br />3. Not sure what the point of the book is?  Are outliers \\"bad\\"?  It seems that Malcom wants to do away with the individual and transform the US educational system into a brave new world.  Who needs families or human bonds with friends when you could be spending all day in school (10 hours a day, 6 days a week, including summers).  Hey comrade, at least you will learn to SSLANT and you might end up getting a job with similar work hours and rewards. I totally agree with Malcom.  Kids don't need to play.  They should be taught a young age to comply, follow rules, and work hard. Free exploration of the environment might actually lead humans to explore possibilities or get the idea that life should be enjoyable.<br /><br />4.  Too many data tables from limited/biased samples.  I really question some of these findings.  If I ask a random sample of McDonald's customers in the town of Waverly, Virginia if they would prefer french fries or blueberries; I could deduce that Americans like fried starches better than fresh produce.<br /><br />This is a very brief list.  Too much of my time has been lost on this book.  I kept reading because it was touted to me as inspiring, insightful, and thought provoking.  I will give it thought provoking.  While there were some interesting ideas presented in the book, I found myself constantly questioning the data and agenda of it.
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|I am among those who believe that \\"Born and Raised\\" was one of John Mayer's greatest achievements. Introspective lyrics, thoughtful singing, nicely played singer songwriter music. But I now guess that those introspection motivations have been purged from his system, as \\"Paradise Valley\\" plays the same sort of lite-folk rock, but without the emotional substance. Sure, he still plays guitar like the whizz-kid he was when his first album dropped 10 years ago (!), and he shoulders the mantle of early eighties Eric Clapton quite well. However, Clapton's albums in the early eighties were light-weight. So is \\"Paradise Valley.\\"<br /><br />It does indicate that the folk-pop of \\"Born and Raised\\" was no fluke, and many of the songs here sound delightful on first passing. \\"Wildfire\\" really does that \\"Slowhand\\" thing better than about anyone short of Eric himself, or even how it neatly references the style of Jerry Garcia, and it's hard to go wrong when you pick a song from the late JJ Cale as your cover-version (\\"Call Me The Breeze,\\" ironically first popularized by Lynyrd Skynyrd). He goes for some of that introspection on \\"Dear Marie,\\" but the lyric is more like a self-directed pity party. Same goes for \\"Paper Doll,\\" his response to Taylor Swift's \\"Dear John.\\" Although I love the line about \\"22 girls in one.\\" It's all cushioned in the 70's style that defined the likes of Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor as kingpins of mellow country rock, right down the the pedal steel in the clever \\"You're No-one Till Someone Lets You Down.\\"<br /><br />There are still a couple of unpredictable moments here that, oddly enough, come from the invited guests. Hip-hop artist Frank Ocean does a brief reprise of \\"Wildfire\\" that recasts the album's opening gambit as a soulful interlude. The other of \\"Paradise Valley's\\" hidden surprises comes courtesy of Katy Perry, who drops the over the top pop chanteuse act long enough to deliver a nuanced and effective duet on \\"Who You Love.\\" Given Perry's flair for confectionery pop without a drop of subtlety, coming off as a genuine romantic singer will shock both her critics and those who may question Mayer's instincts.<br /><br />That's not enough to save \\"Paradise Valley\\" from being something of a letdown. I doubt if Mayer has run out of things to try, as \\"Paradise Valley\\" is as different as \\"Continuum\\" was to \\"Heavier Things\\" or for that matter, the blues/pop balance of \\"Battle Studies.\\" It's more of a refinement of \\"Born and Raised\\" instead of a growth from it, so \\"Paradise Valley\\" sounds just fine without exceeding Mayer's previous or better albums.r confectionery pop without a drop of subtlety, coming off as a genuine romantic singer will shock both her critics and those who may question Mayer's instincts.<br /><br />That's not enough to save \\"Paradise Valley\\" from being something of a letdown.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I once knew a woman that was a passenger on an orphan train. She was hard and bitter, and never got past the fact that she had been sent off to &#34;wherever&#34; the train stopped. She never forgave her mother for doing this to her, she truly was not an orphan, her mother was still living. This book gave me a totally different perspective to the fact that there were thousands that flourished and became educated and productive citizens. Kline has done extensive research of the &#34;Orphan Trains&#34;, I found the epilogue fascinating. I had little idea how many children and families this had affected. The story is heartfelt, and the endurance of these orphans to overcome their hardships is amazing.
0062020897|5.0|This is my first book by the author. And being an avid reader, I can say I wasn't at all disappointed. It was a very well written work of fiction based on WWII. The language was impeccable as was the description and the plot was weaved masterfully. A good read.

Her tale was so touching, and I loved the main character that tells the story through her aging eyes at the end of her life. You envision everything that she sees and feel her emotion. See described the past life's tales as I have witnessed sitting with the elderly in there last days. Emotional, touching, I loved it!!!

B00ARA4SLU|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock certainly had a stellar career as a movie director becoming quite possibly the greatest director of all time. If not the greatest then with no question one of the greatest. His body of work is an endless list of outstanding films that are far too many to mention. His film career spanned around 50 years from the mid 1920's to 1976 when he made his last movie. Out of all the great films that were made by Hitchcock there is one in particular that will always stand out among those he made.<br /><br />The movie \\"Hitchcock\\" is all about that one film that would become the highpoint in Hitchcock's career. \\"Psycho\\". It was something radically different from what Hitchcock had directed in the past and there were many who were sure Hitchcock had lost his mind in wanting to make such a gristly story into a movie. As the movie tells however Hitchcock was at a point in his career where he thought people were losing interest in the kind of movies he was making. That of course is not to say he was making bad movies. Far from it. Before \\"Psycho\\" Hitch had made \\"North By Northwest\\", certainly one of his better classic films starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Sensing however that the public was starting to look for something different in movies Hitchcock wanted to change direction in the kind of movies he was making.<br /><br />Hitch had read a book about the real story of Ed Gein, a murderer of at least 2 known women and who also robbed graves for body parts. In addition to Norman Bates from \\"Psycho\\" Ed Gein would become the inspiration for the character Leatherface from \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and Jame Gumb from \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\". Hitchcock anyway had the inspiration for his next movie. The trick now was getting others to go along with his next project which would not only include Paramount Pictures but his own wife Alma as well. It would not be easy to do and that is what \\"Hitchcock\\" is about, what Hitchcock had to do in order to make what would become one of the most popular movies ever made. Of course while \\"Hitchcock\\" is about making the film \\"Psycho\\" it is at the same time a look behind the scenes in Hollywood at how the movie industry works and how deals are made to casting the right actors for the parts to getting script approval which includes dealing with the censors (my favorite scene in \\"Hitchcock\\" is when Hitch is talking with a person who is questioning about the shower scene and if the young lady will be naked in the shower. Hitchcock reply with \\"No she will be wearing a shower cap\\". Certainly a classic Hitchcock comeback.) to dealing with nervous studio heads wanting to see daily shots of what is being filmed. Indeed Hitchcock had to put up with a lot in trying to make \\"Psycho\\" but of course in the end the film is a total triumph for Hitch revitalizing his career and changing how movies would be made in the future as well.<br /><br />Of course there is another Hitchcock that this movie is about. Alma. This is as much about her as it is about Alfred. Alma had to put up with a lot with the filming of \\"Psycho\\". Alma always knew she was an important part in Alfred life, even when he would have an infatuation with whichever leading lady he was working with at the time. \\"Psycho\\" with its leading lady Janet Leigh would prove different though. Of course in the beginning Alma thought making \\"Psycho\\" was a big mistake for Alfred to make. In time though she would come around to the project and become the biggest supporter in its making, including going along with coming up with the funds themselves to make \\"Psycho\\" which would put both of them in a financial hardship without knowing if it would all pay off. In the meantime the pressure is mounting and Alfred's latest infatuation with Janet Leigh becomes to much for Alma and puts a strain on their marriage. A strain to the point her attention turns to a male friend of hers who is a writer and asks her for help with his latest project. When Alfred finds out about this it is his turn to become jealous of what is going on. Of course all works out well in the end for the Hitchcocks. Even though you know how the story will end and the success that \\"Psycho\\" will become it is still a compelling movie to watch as you see what went on behind the scenes as one of the greatest horror films was being made.<br /><br />There two reasons why this movie is so interesting to watch. One is Anthony Hopkins in the lead role as Hitchcock. While not I feel a spot on impersonation of Alfred Hitchcock, Hopkins still gives one of his best performances since \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" and it doesn't take long as you watch the film to forget it is Hopkins playing Hitchcock and start believing it is Hitchcock himself up there on the screen. The other reason the film is so good is Helen Mirren as Alma. In some ways this is more her movie then Alfred's and certainly rates among one of Helen's greatest acting roles.<br /><br />I give this movie high recommendation for anyone to watch whether you are a fan of Hitchcock, horror movies or like films about the workings of Hollywood itself. This is a movie anyone can get into and get lost in the story about one of the most important movies that almost wasn't made but in the end was.ut this it is his turn to become jealous of what is going on. Of course all works out well in the end for the Hitchcocks.

In some ways this is more her movie then Alfred's and certainly rates among one of Helen's greatest acting roles.<br /><br />I give this movie high recommendation for anyone to watch whether you are a fan of Hitchcock, horror movies or like films about the workings of Hollywood itself. This is a movie anyone can get into and get lost in the story about one of the most important movies that almost wasn't made but in the end was.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Historical facts, without understanding the mindset of the times, seldom expose the full story. Knowledge, epically<br />the<br /> kind that makes you question, should not be feared or avoided. The author has<br /> done a wonderful job of sharing his interpretation of historical events, and possible explanations of the contradictions found in other sources.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chrome cast ,<br />I love This gadget! Easy to install and it works really well. Great buy for $35.00 Thanks google!<br />Royson
B000ZELISO|5.0|I had no problems with this purchase. Movie worked and I was happy to find it at a great price.
B006Z00R1Q|3.0|why you would be \\"filming\\" at that time. The lunacy of that camera detracts from the scary stuff going on around them. I get that it's the whole premise of the movie, but really? I've seen the 1st three movies in order of appearance, but you should really watch them backwards or take them as 3 different movies. By the time I got to this one, I didn't remember the plots of the other two except it involved 1st person camera work, 2 sisters and things that go bump in the night then snap you in half/break your neck within a month. This one had a couple of good deaths and some creepy moments but again what's the point? There's a coven and apparently grama's the ringleader and there's something to do with a demon marriage and based on the other movies, the girls don't remember anything?<br /><br />As a stand alone film it's a decent watch especially if you're into this type of film.
0143115723|5.0|This was an immensely interesting book. I was coming of age when stories out of South Africa were in the news almost daily. I remember this being one of the first major news stories that I followed as a young adult (the power shift, that is) and I remember being quite mesmerized by it. I'm glad I was able to read an insider's take on the happenings, and wish I hadn't waited 20 years later to do so.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is not a play-by-play of the rugby games. Outside of the final game, little details of the action on the pitch is described, and honestly, even the final game is not entirely descriptive. This book explores more of the juxtaposition of sports and political turmoil. Similar to the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team. If you are wanting a story about rugby, it's not going to be your first choice. However, it's an extremely interesting perspective when discussing Apartheid and interesting to see how it was used as a political tool to unify a country that was completely divided.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book. It was a great way to explore the political shift in South Africa in the mid-90's without having to read a book that is written like a news article. The only thing I felt the book was lacking was a bit more background in some of the players on the team.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|I loved the performance of the new cd . I liked the eastern europe  sound. I think the band has steadily improved with every album! { I loved the early  albums too!}  I wasn;t too happy with the Fox news endorsement ,  Totally inapropriate.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I always check reviews and I look at low ratings I usually do not agree with them BUT in this case I do just looking at the photos gave me a headache
B008X8RSTM|1.0|Required too much input to be effective. Wastes time. This approach is a poor one. I want to enter zip code and find a map of the area.  This app asks for state, County,  city.  That's too much.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Im only 13 years old and yes in need this for school for the people who want this must get it
B009YG2ND8|4.0|It is actually a full video game. I have a hard time following the story because I only play for a bit every few weeks. (baby toddler and all the normal life stuff take up most of my time...) but it is just like a normal video game! The controls take a bit of getting used to, but if you don't like it- then don't play these games on your kindle. Simple as that. :-)<br />There are no &#34;cut videos&#34; in here like there usually are in final fantasy games, but the music is good, the story line is fun, and the combat system is just like any other &#34;older style&#34; ff game. i will be playing it again once I finish it through the first time. fun!
0785153942|5.0|i loved the movie so i decided to buy this. it was awesome because it provided more of a back story. i am hoping for more from the pacific rim franchise.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition.  Did not open just yet.  Been pretty busy.  Read the book and am eager to see the film.
B004TFLYRA|4.0|This was a great book. Only reason i didn't give it five stars was because it is the last in the series, very sad about that :(
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a very interesting game. It is at least a couple hours of game play. The hidden object puzzles are somewhat challenging and you really have to look to find a lot of items. The storyline is also very interesting. Would highly recommend.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Action is fast paced and I enjoyed the &#34;inside&#34; perspective presented through the characters. Physical details and descriptions handled well.  Good plot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think in season 3, everyone needs to keep an open mind. great season! I cant wait until season 4
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I was really impressed when I went to use this, It really makes setting up and using the GoPro fast and efficient
0064471837|5.0|YA stories with a female protagonist on a quest are a dime a dozen these days.  More often than not, they are superficial veneers with nothing inside, easier to forget than remember.  Not Nix's Abhorsen trio.  Everything about his stories is memorable.  Starting with Sabriel, we're  introduced to a world where mundane and magic are only separated by a border between countries.  A border that is affected by the direction of the wind.  A world where the Dead (note the capital D) are not just dead.<br /><br />Sabriel is a product of both worlds.  Her father is Abhorsen, the familial title and job of a necromancer who's purpose is to make sure the Dead are fully dead and not brought back for nefarious purpose.  When Abhorsen goes missing Sabriel must leave the her mundane finishing school and dive head-first back into the world of magic and Death.  She must find her Father.<br /><br />As she journeys, we are introduced to many a memorable character.  Most notably Mogget, a singularly sarcastic cat who is much much more than he seems (keep a close eye on that one).  And Touchstone, a young man harboring secrets and perhaps a key from the past that will help Sabriel on her journey.  Nix builds your relationship with the characters slowly, giving you glimpses into their past, teasing out who they are and how they got there.  Much like you would make a friend.<br /><br />Since I can't make you read the Abhorsen series, I can only say that you'd be missing out on more than just a story.  You'd miss out on making lifelong friends.  You'd miss out on an adventure that cannot be described.
B009ZQJ0ME|4.0|This was pretty good.  Decent special effects.  A lot of the fight scenes reminded me of Ultraviolet.  Video quality and sound were good as well.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game is awesome the was a little different than some finding game but it was great so get this game
B00908DDZM|5.0|I absolutely love this entire album. Can't get enough of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis definitely came up with a great cd and great lyrics along with it. My favorite songs are 10,000 hours or days, thrift shop, can't hold us and something to do with a cadillac.
B004Z4M15Y|4.0|I found &#34;To the Lighthouse&#34; to be a difficult but rewarding read...I would recommend starting with the annotated biography of the author at the beginning of the book, but saving the &#34;Introduction&#34; section for last (unless you don't mind having the key plot turning points revealed).  The annotations are very helpful and explain why the book was so groundbreaking.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|she sings with angst, power and pulls at my heart strings-especially the story. love this is my song too......i'd marry her today
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Absolutely love this group and cd the first time I heard radioactive playing on the radio. I just had to see what this group was all about. I fell in love with the cd the first time I heard it. Favorite songs are of course radioactive, demons and top of the world.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game makes you think things through. levels could be more challenging but overall was a good game to play during my free time.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It's good. I liked the graphics, but I hate the long wait times... overall though it's a good tablet/phone game.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Fun and a challenge for all ages old and young sure to keep u busy for long time have fun
0345529057|5.0|It's not the fancy, hardbound edition, but it works. I love the details and the perspectives of each chapter. It is a bit of a different style of writing than I'm used to, but I love it! I can't wait until the last two books come out!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is great and entertaining,takes awhile to down load but worth the weight,if you have asphalt 7 you'll love this one,A8 jump at high speeds,collect rewards<br />do roll overs for points,same principal as A7 but a little better,I recommend this<br />cool game.  :  )
140006922X|5.0|Read It If You Dare With An Open Mind. I Love Jesus Christ And Found Nothing Offensive In This Book Full Of A Wealth Of Information. Be sure And Read It With Highlighter In Hand
B004OT2UE2|5.0|I have chosen this rate because the seller sent the package perfectly on time. The quality of the item is above my expectations, and my son really loved playing with the Lego.<br /><br />Really amazing experience!!!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|It was very over the top computer graphics, and a predictable plot but the Troll was really cute. and special effects were good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is great to have the Bible at my finger tip and this is exactly what it feel like to even look up favorite passages
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I have tried many of these types of apps and for a free version this is far superior than any I've tried. It takes excellent pictures of docs and has great uploading capabilities. It allows uploads to Google docs, Evernote, etc. And you can sync your docs up to s certain amount on the free app. I will upgrade to the paid one because I use this all this time. Would be dissapointed.
B007EC27QM|1.0|A calculator that doesn't follw the order of operations as taught in middle school is not not worth much.  It doesn't help most people find the correct result to a series of calculations.  Ask any math teacher what good is such a calculator---not worth the effort to use one.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A lot of fun! Well done game that you can spend hours on. The power ups make it a crazy experience
B007N8RULO|5.0|fun and entertaining game of strategy.  good addtion to our entertaiment.  you don't need more words to evaluate such a game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderfully done, I have seen all episodes in a row and season 3 is by far my favorite would recommend to others!
B008KE3960|5.0|This game today passes lots and lots of time, way different in the tower defense games, but if you open yourself to new and cool strategy, this is the game.
1892005034|4.0|My therapist recommended this book. Like so many Therapy/ Self-Help books I have had recommended I figured this was just another one with obscure generalizations that were as useful as a prediction from Nostradamus, in other words not much. I read several chapters and I was pleasantly surprised. While there was some &#34;touchy feely&#34; things there was a fair amount of useful information with regard to how easy it to say the wrong things even when we are doing what to ourselves seems correct. The tone of voice we use when answering or asking a question, the judgmental words we use in return, it affects any type of help or positive results we need. I wish I could find the book right now to give some examples but it is amongst my big unorganized pile of books somewhere on my front room couch.<br />The vendor was quick, I think the book was at my doorstep before I had finished the order!, just kidding but it was quick. The cover and spine were good and no dog ears on the pages. Vendor rating 5 stars.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I was hesitant at first but it's a great game and worth the 99 cents to buy it. I'm glad I did.
B00A4B9A1U|5.0|It's amazing that socialism/communism was so much alive until after WW2, more amazing still that Uncle Joe Stalin only became evil after so many broken promises by USA. So much ineptitude in the White House for so many Presidents. Heart breaking that Gorbachev's efforts, for decommissioning nukes, even after acceptance of all conditions, were not accepted by non compos Reagan. But life goes on. with USA as world policeman, installing right wing despots then undermining them with covert action by CIA. The rich and powerful get richer and destroy lives, flora, fauna and now atmosphere. Is it really home of the free and land of the brave or is there a chance Americans have been the teensiest bit brainwashed?
0425238091|5.0|I first read this as a medical student. I trained years after this was written, but I swear I knew each of these physicians during my training. Thankfully, medical training is not like this anymore!
B004DH8IK0|5.0|One of the best bands I've heard in years! Do yourself a favor and get this album. Their blend of rock-step and great vocals had me wanting to buy the other albums off the bat.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|My husband and I are both engineers, we laughed so hard at this series... it's appeal to us geeks was immeasurable, what geek doesn't privately want to be a secret agent? Wonderful characters, fun story line. It is light and appealing for the whole family, something not often found in today's TV series.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I've owned at least 4 of these headphones.  As others have said, they're great for long runs.  However, they do tend to break after a few months.  I double-checked my past orders on Amazon, and as recently as a few months back these same headphones cost under ten dollars.  Now I see they're nearly forty.  I don't know what changed with Amazon (Target still has them for around twelve dollars), but they're just not worth that price.
B002R88G4U|5.0|A homage to readers, reading, friendship and survival<br /><br />I could have finished this little marvel in one afternoon but I made it last five days: I just didn't want the joy to end<br /><br />Why did it take me five years to discover it? I'll be making sure as many readers as possible discover it now
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great documentary. Chronicles Sound City and all the bands that recorded there. David Grohl did an excellent job writing, producing, and bringing this video to market. If I could pick another star, I'd give it 6! Watch it. You'll love some of the surprise artists that just show-up during the filming. Very cool...
B002VPE1XY|5.0|Bought is for a compact camera, It fits great and has an overall high-end feel. (Not happy about having to add unnecessary words to every review I write!!!)
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is the 2nd Nevosoft game I've played, but this one has no voice actors. The story is told via dialog boxes which is no biggie except there are typos and the volume of text is unevenly distributed--some chapters have a lot more text than others to be read before getting to the actual puzzle.<br /><br />Minus one star for the typos and stuff.
B00BU18U82|3.0|Fun game but all of the non default farming equipment such as tractors, harvesters, plows ect. Costs real money to get. I WANT A REFUND!!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a really good game that is if you are the people who are interested in the mind working game. I really enjoy this game,yes this game might take a while of your time to play, but I'm most certain that you are going to really enjoy this game. The best of luck to all the people who are interested in this game and who all are going to give this game a try. Enjoy all.
B008H7HE9S|4.0|I really enjoy their music, but I don't need the expletives in the lyrics.  Was glad to find a clean version that I can enjoy and can enjoy with my teenager in the car.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game...... Great graphics........ Lots of different horses to buy....... The only thing that I don't like about this game is that to do things you have to have energy to do it.......:(  Don't like those types of games.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Saw this with my daughters in the theater and enjoyed watching it again at home.  My 17 year old loves it and my 20 year old wanted her boyfriend to see it too.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! I'm not a parent yet but I imagine pregnancy/ parenthood has all these ups & downs which was entertaining to watch!
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Very much like Toy Defense 1 but with new features, plays the same, really enjoyable to play. I would not hesitate to suggest you buy this game
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I travel with my kindle fire and often hotel rooms don't have a clock.  I can use this clock not only as an alarm, but also just to see the time in the dark.  It works out great.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Since upgrading to the latest version this game now freezes up on my tablet and a couple of minute, I have a PendoPad 9.7\\" PNDPP4MT9G3. this is only happening since the latest update.<br /><br />Yesterday my tablet memory crashed, after reseting and re-downloading my games. I loaded Minion Rush, purchased a truckload of coins, brought the golden shield and 2 costumes. by the time i'd done that it was time to go to bed. this morning i got up and loaded the game to play it and my purchases were gone, in fact the game had reset itself offereing me the initial free 50 coins and i had no purchases left.<br />even the cloud data said it had a conflict, as of last night i had 100 coins left, when the conflict screen loaded, both the local and remote data stated i had 0 coins left.<br /><br />so it seems there is a BUG in the game that allows your purchases to be lost.<br /><br />I have also found a second bug that gets different tablets cloud data confused this is due to both tablets connecting to the internet via a wifi router on the same computer. one tablet is a pendo pad 9.7\\" with purchases via amazon with game version 1.1.1, the other tablet is a Nexus 7 with purchases via google play and game version 1.2.0. And yet, minion me game gets the two mixed up, both tablets always get conflicting data.<br /><br />To avoid the 2nd issue I recommend not playing minion me on a wifi only tablet. ie You must always be connected to the internet when playing.<br /><br />I don't know how to get around the loss of coins except take the issue up with your bank.<br /><br />Regards
B009AY04A8|1.0|I have spent more time fast clicking through the dribble dialog than waiting for it to reload than actually playing the game.<br /><br />Do people really enjoy listening to all that dribble?<br /><br />Glad this was the free app of the day.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Want to waste a lot of time and have fun doing so, then this is your game, can be played for hours, very challenging, I must admit I'm got so far and am now frustrated trying to figure out how to get to the next level but thats the challenge, so it works for me.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This is a great book that will motivate you.  Each of the spiritual laws will help you to connect your thinking in a positive way to the world around you.  This book is an easy must read!
1401324649|5.0|This book is definitely a page turner. :) Not because it includes action, but it does, not because it's funny, but it is and not because it's very well written, but it really truly is, but mostly because Allan - the said character who climbed out the window and disappeared - is just such a breath of fresh air (never mind the 100 years). The characters in the book are quite different and very well developed by the author.<br />The language is just plain flowing. You're thinking about what might happen next as you're reading, or if you've had the misfortune to have to put the book down and meet some life necessity, then you're thinking what might have happened if you kept reading it.<br />It's really THAT good. I finished the book in 2 days but I do have that life necessity called work in the middle. I shall be conversing with Allan for quite a while now, when I am pondering how I could find a suitcase of my own during my travels...<br />Jonas Jonasson is definitely a new favorite author. This was his first book I read, but will definitely be following him from now on.<br />Yes - I do recommend this book very much, don't you reviewer also agree?
1401938906|5.0|This book is so cool! The experiments in this book really work!  It has helped me to change my think around too.  After reading some of the chapters in this book I felt way more positive and optimistic in my approach to getting what I want in life!  Everything is energy and this book helps you to really experience that in a fun way.  The author also has a great sense of humor and keeps it interesting.  A must read!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I've seen this movie time and time again, but always love it.  I particularly like the simplicity of streaming it to my new TV....nice.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am rather impressed. I was expecting to get bored quickly but now I am enchanted and have seriously been having fun. Graphics are beautiful, music is soothing and each game is a different challenge. I have not experienced any of the nagware that people have complained about and I have yet to be bored.
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|I don't know if it's the Samsung Tablet or me or the Amazon App for Android, but if I'm really serious about doing something on Amazon, I'll switch to my desktop and forget the tablet.  The app is OK, but navigation is annoying and clumsy, as is filling in any forms.  Again, it's OK to help you get to the point to make a decision, but once I'm ready to put my money into the equation, I'll go to the desktop where I can control the input.  Clunky.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I have enjoyed many of Kensells's books and, above all, look forward to her sense of humour. Though I did enjoy this story, it was not as witty as most of her other books and so a tad bit of a let-down.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I'll admit it, I'm getting hooked on Amazon....but this app for Android phones is really clunky.  I know I've got fat fingers, but really...this is annoying.  Once I want to purchase something, I'll switch to the laptop where I can control the input....the last thing I need is to mess up a money thing.  Clunky.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Loved this puzzle . Beautiful detailed pictures . Imaginative storyline . Quite a variety of puzzles to solve . Well done.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I'm a Christian and enjoyed this book so much. It gave me the background my preacher is so afraid to share.  I live close to where this author teaches and attend mega-church.  The truth the author provides is indisputably.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is a lot of fun, addicting. I was very happy to get for free like everyone else can on their phones and ipods.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely need to get a copy and read it ASAP!! It will tear your heart out and put it back feeling all mangled up. But it will hurt so good, because this is, by far, one of the best books I have ever read. The emotions in this book are so genuine, and the characters so real, you won't be able to put this book down. And seriously, bring a box of tissues!!<br /><br />This may be YA literature, but to me it did not read like YA literature. It has something for everyone in it. The teens are so likable, which I don't always find to be the case in YA fiction. And they were funny in a way that only kids who are dying of cancer can be, I think. And the parents...as a parent, oh how I felt for the parents. I don't even want to imagine what their pain feels like, but Mr. Green wrote about it in a sensitive and caring way that shows great respect, and I love that.<br /><br />This book made me laugh and made me cry. It is a veritable roller coaster of emotion. And I love all the characters in it except Peter Van Houten. But he is the kind of person you love to hate.<br /><br />Seriously...I can't say it enough...go get this book! It is AMAZING! It deserves 10 stars!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|No matter the age, such a fun game to pass the time. We compete for scores, distance and bananas ;-) Perfect!
B00386EZJU|5.0|I listened casually to this soundtrack about a year ago and then put it down. Then I returned to it about a month ago and gave it a close listen and fell in love with it.<br /><br />It has themes of romance, friendship, wonder, terror, and heroism. It's a loud collection but it's also full of heart and melody.<br /><br />I have to applaud the composer for infusing this children's fantasy with so many soulful notes. Never has Scottish-tinged fanfare sounded so universally moving, so transcendent.<br /><br />Many films try to romanticize flight and condense the ebullience of first flight into a single cue. Rarely has this been so successful as in cues like \\"Coming Back Around\\" and \\"Test Drive.\\"<br /><br />\\"Forbidden Friendship\\" is a subtle, lush ode to amity.<br /><br />\\"Dragon Battle\\" is a layered, powerful evocation of the dragon at war.<br /><br />Overall, a bombastic and uplifting score--one of the best Hollywood fantasy scores of all time. Turn it up to high volume for maximum enjoyment of all the activity of the orchestra. Congratulations to Mr. Powell!
B009AY04A8|3.0|A lot of talking but not bad. It's like a lot of other games like this. Nice change from the card games though.
B00874T02K|4.0|This is a great program for people with busy schedules. It can be easily adapted to your physical recovery capability and experience level. It also gives you a total bodyweight calisthenic workout that makes you stronger and is very convenient (you can perform the workout just about anywhere in your home). Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Add minecarts and tracks, ability to select/create skins, spawn wolfs, spawn villagers, ability to switch between creative and survival, choose different worlds instead of entering seeds, stuff like that. Overall, it's a great game, just i'd give some ideas.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is a fine series.  I bought the collection for my daughter.  The seller was very prompt, the product was exactly as described and very reasonable.  Everything was perfect.
1119962846|5.0|I love this book.  It's very intuitive.  With no prior use of this software, within 20-30 hours I was doing some pretty complex data analysis and processing.
B004I11VZA|5.0|Best movie ever, Best movie ever, Best movie ever. Fast shipping, good price. (Ip Man 1 is better). Bluray is the way to watch movies.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I thought it was very engaging and interesting, I wanted to know what happened! I really liked the way the story was told, it had all the bases covered. I would highly reccomend this book for a riviting read.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Being a long-time sci-fi fan I would have to say that Falling Skies is just different enough to set it apart from other similar earth invasion scenarios.
B005PK553C|5.0|I watched this series as quickly as possible, there was always an element of suspense. I don't really like horror movies but this was a great balance of creepy without being too scary for me. There were lots of jumpy moments and some rather gruesome subject matter but all in all it was a really great watch.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Throughly, cleverly made movie with a climactic ending.  The color is great as so the sets. In 3-D it brought out all scenes.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is a fun game that fills empty time. My grand kids really like it and they try to beat grandma's score
1449410243|5.0|I'm a fan of the Oatmeal comic, and was very pleased to pass this along to friends who have cats. Makes a GREAT Christmas gift.<br /><br />Check it out - you won't be disappointed.
B0058VA2U4|4.0|I like it for anthrax it's not as good Among or Sound of but it is very solid. Charlie is as good as ever,Scott melodies are some of the best head banging ever.Beladonna sounds young. To me it misses that spitz effect I loved them  more with that little extra special guitar lead.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case has held up great. I bought it for my fiance about a year ago, and it still looks new. It's fairly tough, and the elastic band has held up great.<br /><br />I recommend!
B000002L61|5.0|Back in the eighties goin to school popping this into the walk man and forgetting about $h!+ . Classic work from Vivian don't know why he wasted away in that leopard .
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|The Withings Pulse is my first activity tracker and I am very happy with it. It seems to track my steps fine, my heart rate, and my sleep all without any issues. The charge lasts for many days at a minimum. The companion app and the fact that it integrates with many different apps as well is a great feature.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was really surprised at how much I like this app. I was able to easily find my local radio stations as well as explore others with the genre I liked.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|We have 10-12 yr old boys and find that there is a lack of CLEAN action adventure movies this is one such movie
B0073V7YTY|5.0|I was vey surprised that an Android app would be this responsive and accurate. Of course, you are going to be limited by the range capabilities of the Android's built-in microphone. This is a great app with features that surpassed my expectation.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|We really like this light and use it in our motorhome for safety and security.  It is both motion and light sensing so it doesn't light unless it is dark -very good feature.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It was the now familiar attempt by Fox News to suppress this book that got me interested.  There's no question that Aslan's reliance on historical documents to paint a picture of the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth (not Jesus the Christ, as the author regularly points out) presents new information that will challenge much of what Christians accept as &#34;gospel.&#34;  Still, the Jesus of history proves to be nothing short of a fascinating story in this book which is artfully narrated.  I heartily recommend this reading for anyone with a mind open to information beyond the religious paradigm.
B00846REIS|3.0|The book is almost a total copy of 50 shades of Grey ... I felt like I was reading the same book that I just read, except the names were different.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|best I found so far like simplicity of combining sounds helps me fall and stay asleep especially when at other places then home
B008220BLG|5.0|I'm not much of a zombie fan.  I have only recently been able to stomach The Walking Dead series from AMC and still cringe through pretty much every zombie scene.  I struggled through Zombieland and I have yet to sit through the entire Shaun of the Dead movie.  But I am getting better so when Warm Bodies was released in theaters, I begrudgingly went...and was pleasantly surprised.  Nicholas Hoult is adorable (I know, not a phrase one wants to hear about a zombie) as R, the undead misfit who falls in love with Julie, the daughter of the leader of a group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse.  The movie ignores explaining the origins of the zombie plague in favor of creating a movie in the unique perspective of the deceased.<br /><br />R isn't your typical zombie, he's a loner who feels out of place among his undead compatriots existing in an airport.  He doesn't remember his life before he died, he doesn't remember how he died, and he doesn't remember his own name, but he knows he feels abnormal (even for zombie standards).  While on a &#34;food run&#34;, he encounters Julie, played by the pretty Teresa Palmer.  Julie is part of a ragtag group of survivors, all teenagers which begs the question, &#34;why send the hope of humanity out on a suicidal pharmacy run?&#34; who encounter the zombie horde.  R rescues Julie and takes her home, disguised as a zombie by smearing his smelly black blood on her face.  The rest of the movie is a thinly veiled twist on Shakespeares &#34;Romeo and Juliet.&#34;<br /><br />It's a clever movie, much better than the poorly executed book it was based on, and deserves to be seen.  I highly recommend it.
B000B589JI|4.0|Works really well gotta make sure you put it back together tight enough or it will leak! But it deffinitly comes in handy as long as you remeber to actually fill the canister
B00002SSKI|5.0|It's funny, it's happy, it's sad.  It's a movie about real life in the 70's.  Wholesome enough to watch with your mother and your children.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was amazing. It truly impacted my life during a difficult time. I highly recommend this book. Great book
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Have been using it for a week and an awesome product for the price. Worked seamlessly from my PC and for Netflix/YouTube. Waiting for the iOS app.

B00005V9HH|5.0|I love the way this story comes together.  Twists and turns in the story make it truly entertaining.  Definitely a must watch!
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Another &quot;free app of the day&quot; that expects all kinds of scary permissions. Why does it need my email contacts and browser history or bookmarks? Either the creator used more permissions than they meant or they are doing something suspicious.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is simple in concept but fun and challenging as you get into the higher levels. I recommend it for when your brain needs a break but you still want to be challenged in some way.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very, very fun. Probably will not get too far, because I have trouble controlling the slingshot like apparatus to shot the bubbles.  Also not sure how to wiggle the tablet to get jems in the 1000 pot. But that's the challenge!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|We enjoyed this game so much. Wish there were more levels though. . . We finished all 10 levels in 2 days
B000065V42|1.0|fun flick....released 1:85 format in theaters.....this release 1:33...if you don't care if you miss some of the movie this is a good buy for you. if you want to see the movie the way the director wanted you to see it then skip this release
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series was so well done that I have recommended it to several friends and they are now hooked on the series.  It is excellent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game.  I wish it had more than 10 levels (kindle version - ipad version has only 8 free and additional levels for purchase).  The puzzles are challenging but not impossible.
B00CMB8MXC|5.0|This product arrived faster than expected and in great condition.  I have enjoyed listening to this soundtrack and how it reminds me of the movie
B005BGBPBG|5.0|\\"Something Borrowed\\" is a fun romantic comedy with a great cast, it's well-written and hopeful.  E.Giffin does a great job pulling this story together.  The classic theme is a bit reminiscent of Pride & Prejudice, a favorite.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Ozzy's still got it its an awesome cd and even better concert heavy metal always Rock On  :0 :-- peace
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This family story continues to keep me looking forward to each show. They are ripe with  intrigue and never disappointing; each and every episode is captivating. Love it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I always play this game with my little sister!! We love it a lot!! I thought it would be dumb but it is AWESOME
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Love this movie. I never read a Thor comic but after watching this movie a ran out and got 20. will keep reading and can't wait for the sequel. Also had great actors. love the Shakespeare English
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It could have been a little more challenging for me but that's just me.<br />I think it was easier then I thought it would be but I'm glad they didn't make it real hard to.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|looks great on the kindle fire and game play is fast and easy. simple game but I could play it a long time. I picked it up for free, but for 99&cent; it wouldn't be a bad deal.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the weather channel. I have on all of my devices. That way not only can I check what our weather is going to be but also what the weather is where my Sister and my youngest Son lives.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Planet Earth has supposedly been devastated by a war with 'aliens', and most of humanity is living off world on Saturn's Moon 'Titan'.  A few stay back to watch over and protect the 'power generators' sending the power back to the Titan Station.  You see transmissions between the maintenance crew and Titan, protecting and maintaining these power generators, and then these few are looking forward to joining 'Titan Earth' people.<br /><br />This movie has many refreshing twists.  I won't give them away.  Morgan Freeman pops up a little later... :)<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful remembering of what humanity is, was and how much we (I) appreciate the beauty of the Earth as it is.  Another aspect of this movie is that our memories and who we are, are much more than a mechanical, chemical, or robotic program.  Our being or spirit is instead a 'wholographic' and spiritual being, of memory... sorry, better not say more :)<br /><br />There are fun twists later in the movie... This is a movie to me that says \\"yes\\" to our humanity, care, empathy, and appreciation to the beauty of earth,... no to transhumanism and post humanism.  (Look it up)<br /><br />Beyond that, if you don't want to think about 'meanings' or 'morals of the story', it is a great movie of 'empowerment' facing massive odds.<br />I loved this movie.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Anything that is with Lady Antebellum is always good.  Their music is great. I will see them in concert some day.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. I enjoy passing the time playing this game. Kids enjoy playing as well. Great for All ages.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone, the narrator of this story, is a fifteen year old Rain Man. He is as gifted mathematically as Dustin Hoffman was in the movie, but he's as helpless as he was as well, he's socially without a clue. He sees things differently than others, in his words, \\"My memory is like a filmÉ.And when people ask me to remember something I can simply press Rewind and Fast Forward and Pause like on a video recorder.\\" He takes what he's told and what he sees at face value.<br /><br />When he discovers Wellington, a neighbor's pet poodle, killed, stabbed with a pitchfork, he is at first blamed, then he decides to find out for himself who forked the dog. Using Sherlock Holmes as his model, he digs into the crime and this forces him to foray out into the real world, away from the familiar safety of his home and special school. And it also leads to an unraveling of his own family's history. He learns a secret that forces him to re-evaluate everything he's taken for granted and that's pretty scary stuff for a boy like Christopher.<br /><br />Christopher is a wonderful character and he walks through an endearing story well told. This is a book that should be on everybody's Christmas or birthday list. I can't praise it highly enough.
B007SGM084|2.0|The premis for this book is definitely fiction since I don't believe any woman in her right mind would submit to that kind of abuse and enjoy it.  Only a sick mind would consider the simi-rehabilitation of a man with that kind of mental illness as the guide to a happy marriage.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I enjoy the E5 games, but have had some problems with them playing on my kindle. I can play for a long time and loose track of time. I'm still trying to figure out some of the processes of how things work as far as the Internet is concerned.
1936608898|5.0|To me, this is one of the best diet books out there.  I have learned so much about how the body reacts to different foods and drinks.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|No more pages of descriptions of what every character is wearing and the food they are eating.  Just non-stop action (WAR).  It was a fun read but not overly deep.  It also felt rushed.  Too much material crammed into one book to fulfill the contract.  How ironic that the series that dragged on for books on end would end that way.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love Firefly's melange of Old West, space travel, Chinese and English, anti-authoritarianism, and human relationships.  It reminds me of Terry Gilliam's Brazil.  Go Joss Weedon!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is so cheap that it would be worth the price if it never did more than it does now, but with the open-ended design and the stated intent of other content providers to get on board, it seems like a no-brainer. The move from a conventional remote control to casting your tablet view to the TV screen may not sound like that big a deal, but using it just feels way better than even a really good remote. I haven't worked up a lot of enthusiasm for casting actual Chrome browser screens onto the TV yet, but to be fair, I haven't used it that much. But for watching Netflix, etc this thing is great.
B008Y6ZK5C|5.0|David Bowie in a codpiece. What else do you want? Crazy, Tim Burton-esq muppets? Don't worry, it has those too.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The HBO series inspired me to read all five books at one time.  I was not disappointed.  Martin has a gift for creating sympathetic characters and placing them in peril without warning.  He weaves the storylines brilliantly and there are enough surprises to keep any reader satisfied.  The complexity of the plot reminds me of the TV series Lost and hopefully Martin will wrap his series up better than Lost did.  My only two gripes and they are very minor, is that too much time is spent on describing every heraldic design and every dish eaten.  Very highly recommend.
B0010HA68I|5.0|Had a little problem getting the straps through the rings on my camera, but it wasn't too bad.  I keep the straps on my backpack, and have the supplemental neck strap to swap out for regular use when I'm not hiking.  This is the solution I've been looking for for years; I no longer have to take off my pack and go digging for the camera or deal with the damn thing dangling from the strap and slapping against me while hiking.  The strap is also a lot more comfortable than the original OEM one that Canon supplied with my camera.  Prices were well within reason also.  Thanks for a great product guys!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|overall fun to play. but like many of these apps it severely limits one of the resources unless you want to pay. it's too limiting to play without making at least one small purchase. otherwise as long as you are patient it's quite fun, but could be challenging for young kids to wait.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book! Great read, great series. I like how you get to know the characters more in this one.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Love Melody Gardot and gave this to a friend who also likes jazz. He fell in love with her, too!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Good read, love the series, least favorite of the three. I wish it had a better ending, but can't wait for the next one.
0783226837|5.0|Tremors is definitely one of my favorite monster movies.  It is not artsy or deep and it is not supposed to be.  Tremors is meant to be a fun popcorn film, and it definitely succeeds in that.  The characters are fun, the creatures look great, the action scenes are well done, and the film has a great look.<br /><br />First of all the character are great.  The film stars Val (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward).  These two have amazing chemistry together and their banter is very fun to listen to.  They are hired hands living in the small town of Perfection, Nevada.  They decide to leave to pursue better careers elsewhere.  However, as they do people are being killed by large underground creatures that are later named Graboids.<br /><br />The other big characters are Ronda (Finn Carter) who is a college student studying vibrations in the ground and is Val's love interest in the film.  Another big character is Burt Gummer (Michael Gross), who is very paranoid and has tons of weapons in his house.  He is my favorite character in the film and of the entire franchise.  His wife is played by Reba McEntire, who is does great as well.  She also has a song played during the end credits which I enjoy listening to.<br /><br />The effects for this film are top notch.  The creatures actually look really good especially for a film that came out in 1990.  I like the design for the creatures.  I find it to be a very unique design.  The premise is very much like a B-movie.  I like that it does not take itself too seriously.  This film took a ridiculous premise and had fun with it.  I also like the location.  I have seen few monster movies that take place in a location quite like this.  The action scenes are also fun and can be suspenseful.<br /><br />Overall, Tremors is an extremely fun monster movie.  It has great characters, cool creatures, great effects, and great atmosphere.  I think it is one of the most underrated horror/monster movies out there.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. I love the compassion, love, and honesty. This book is an amazing read. I would recommend it to my friends.
B0081336FO|5.0|Seriously this is the best show on television. I just wish there were more of them!!! Please please make more!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I absolutely love Lana Del Rey so I was very excited to see that this CD was quite affordable and qualified for Amazon Prime. The price, quality, and arrival of the product met if not exceeded my expectations through and through. I give this one two thumbs up, five out of five stars and a yelp of joy for how awesome it is!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I couldn't quit playing....... I don't play many games but enjoyed looking for clues on this one........I will keep playing if they give you more rooms.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|I love this game. I play it all day long. U should get this game. The best is that it is free.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts off so easy and then it gets to the really challenging ones, don't want to put it down until solve them all.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Do not download this is you like having free time. this app is great and fun. I enjoy playing it along with my little cousins, nieces, and nephews. It has enough challenge for an adult but enough to also keep a child occupied for a long period of time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game!  Keeps your mind going and tests your memory.  Hints would be nice, but aren't needed if you just keep at it.  I love it and highly recommend the game!
0385528787|3.0|Margaret Atwood is one of my favorite authors and I have all her books.  A HANDMAID'S TALE, Ms. Atwood's first futuristic book was remarkable.  So was ORYX AND CRAKE, the first book in the trilogy which ends with this book, MADDADDAM.  THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD, the second book of the trilogy was, at minimum, thought provoking.  This book, while completing the story, wasn't so enjoyable.  The dialogue was stilted and went on far too long and was boring IMHO.  However, Ms. Atwood makes this new, barren world believable by having Hundred Dollar Stores (which is where we are headed--how many items cost 99 cents even now!) included in those raided for food and other stables and Oreos are one of the food items sometimes found which are considered a special treat (cookies probably packaged before Oryx and Crake, after all, the new Twinkies are supposed to last 45 days!)  But as usual I digress.<br /><br />One thing I did like about this book is the brief summary of the first two books included in front which I found helpful since it had been awhile since I'd read the first two books.  Overall, the meaningful future concerns contained in the trilogy is the corruption of corporate power and/or the dangers of such power, the negative effects of bioengineering (were the Crackers really an improvement over stupid humans or what about the Pigeons?).  Ms. Atwood is skilled at showing the destructive nature of homo sapiens without saying so directly.  She builds a believeable negative future based on this.  I don't want to give anything away since this book wraps up and ends the trilogy but I would recommend this book as many enjoyed it immensely and it is worthwhile to read the book to reach the end.  And, of course, read all her other books as each and every of them are gems!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app its fun and easy and u get a lot of free stuff (like frames and stickers) u should really get this app love it!!!!!!!!!
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|She is a very talented artist. Would recommend this item to everyone. She is a good role model for everyone.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Broadchurch grabs your interest from the start.  Have watched first 2 episodes which offer suspense, good characterizations and writing, the main factor in all dramas.  I can't wait for the next installment.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I have been viewing using live stream through Amazon Prime.  The Tudors is quite entertaining and fun to watch.  The actors do a great job with their parts and make the characters believable.  The costuming and sets are fabulous.  The sound quality is excellent.  I mention this because that means a lot to me - I hate it when sound is fuzzy or it sounds like the actors are mumbling.  I know there are historical inaccuracies, but I'm watching for entertainment, not for class credit!  Halfway through Season 1 and I am totally hooked on this series.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I downloaded this game from amazon. It was a slow rainy day, so I finished it in one day. I agree that there is too much dialogue, but I still enjoyed playing it. I would recommend it.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|Easy and helps in managing my apps and memory. Useful and takes a lil time to get used to the app but then it is a piece of cake.<br />It also lets you chose what you want to shut and does not interfere, i guess i liked that the most.<br />Thanks.
B006LQQ1GE|1.0|I love one song, the one played all the time on the radio.  However, none of the other songs sound like the same band, I gave my CD away.  Sorry
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|So easy to quickly browse through emails....Love it!  My husband had it on his IPAD and now I have it on my kindle too.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Minus 4 stars for the stupidest mistake Hollywood could have ever made in a GI Joe movie.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched it yet.  I'll simply say that Bonaventura and Chu deviated from the GI Joe canon about as far as they could without making Snake Eyes a 12 year old girl that wears a tutu and hands out daisies on the street corner.<br />Well done, producer and director.  You both just solidified the fact that I will never watch another of your movies.  (With the exception of anything Transformers from Bonaventura, since there is a new one in the works.  Chu has never directed or produced anything of substance anyway.)<br />(If you don't care about GI Joe canon, watch it for Dwayne Johnson and Adrianne Palicki.  Holy wowsers is Adrianne hot in this flick.  And they both put on a good acting job.)
0380018179|3.0|For the most part was beautifully written, some passages so much so that I had to go back and reread them to savor the imagery. But look out for the graphic sex scenes showing in vivid, revolting detail, how awful her husband was to her in bed. The description of Austrailia got a bit too long at times, but what really bothered me was the story itself. It seemed to be mostly a way for the author to vent about how much she hated the Catholic church and her bitterness oozed from the pages. And talk about tragic! Pretty much everyone died! Also, the idea that a priest so committed to his calling was having an affair with a married woman really bothered me. And in the end, they were all sad and alone, or dead, except her daughter who I never really like or rooted for. If you want a nice happily ever after, this is not the book to read.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen has some pretty amazing talent with words. Not just a simple book, because to understand her style of writing you have to really think sometimes, but it is a great read. She has a way with words that is very fresh and unique.
B00006674X|5.0|This was a very good movie and I truly enjoyed both Elvis and Mary Tyler Moore. The ending lets one choose the end they want to the movie. Had some social issues highlighted that I liked very much. Elvis at his best. Wish he were my Dr.
B001FB563E|5.0|I love this movie and the Cormac McCarthy book it is based on. I would highly recommend for any new father.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|The story line is a bit shallow but still was a fun movie. I must say I enjoyed the male dancers a lot!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book gets better and better.Gideon Gideon love to have a man look at me like he sees Eva. Love it
1416550550|5.0|I really enjoyed this twisting tale of mystery and unfolding lives.  I had a hard time putting this book down and will soon order another one of Morton's novels.  My only criticism of this book is that in some places the events and scenes were elaborately detailed and then in other places (primarily beginning around 2/3 of the way through the book), the author skipped huge chunks of time which also resulted in weaker character development and left the reader wondering why the heroine's personality weakened for example.  It almost felt as if Morton's editor was rushing her to finish the book.  Nonetheless, it was a highly enjoyable read.
B00846REIS|5.0|This series is better then 50 shades of gray. Really good read. Gideon and Eva have a kind of love I can only dream about.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This book captured my attention and kept it throughout.  A very interesting storyline that kept me engrossed for all the delicious hours it took me to (regrettably) reach the end of the book.  I wish Setterfield would write more.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series I don't know how much more she can wright in the next two books but I will be reading them just to see what's next.
B005723JSQ|5.0|A quick and fun read. I would recommend it to anyone who is wants an easy read. Kept me interested through out the story.
0525952926|4.0|Ken Follett has ambitiously undertaken a portrayal if the events of WW Ii as they came about in various location.  I found it insightful and the characters were charming as in the first volume.  What's missing, oddly,  is Jews, with the exception of the token doctor.  It set me to researching and finding out about their bravery in resisting. The book can only be so long, but I was disappointed that Follett once again has avoided Jews or has made them weak characters.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun fast game that keeps you moving at a great pace and is very challenging . Would recommend to people who enjoy that kind of challenge.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This developer has been very active, for example the last few versions have definitely allowed pencilling in all of the possible values for a digit,  so earlier reviews may not be accurate. The latest version allows specifying a difficulty. This is definitely worth a few dollars. Highly recommended.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Gather around and you shall enjoy great yarns of Sherlock Holmes. From youth to maturity the yarns spin you in with the endless stories from Watson's view. Only Sir Arthur could write with ability to tell the basic story and let Actors of any age bring you to the game that's afoot.

B001H9JBW6|5.0|Check this one out Big Brother is alive and well in this one. The mark of Satan is far to sub than a bar code. This one, you can be erased, barred from everything. Orwell's 1984 is buffed up and polished for this new century. Always was a good yarn, proves it with a remake.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really was not sure if I was going to like this book but oh what a surprise. I found myself constantly nodding my head in agreement. If you are an at home mom or a woman in the workforce (is there a difference?) I think you will enjoy this book.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is a good way to waste time. It is kind of confusing at first but it's still a fun game.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|i only gave it one star so people wld read my review- it deserves 5- i realized watching the features w the commentary on- which one must do these days- making what used to b 90 minutes into 180-that these guys DID NOT know how to tell a story. The story is so complex one has to listen to the features commentary to \\"get it\\"- what w 2 jacks, etc.- but the movie holds yr attention and is intriguing in its difficultness.<br />In the commentary one gets too many self congratulatory remarks abt how great the movie is, how great we are, how great Morgan Freeman is- awesome, unbelievable- does this generation have any modesty?<br />But over all- they did a good job.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I was very happy with this product & am going to purchase 2 more.  I bought this for my Mom & myself.  My mother is 91 & will lose earring aids & I have had sever hearing loss due to problems as a child. As I am semi-retired & my Mom is retired, we just need an application of sound not high-tech hearing aids. These are great for watching TV & doctor appts. to say the least of what they help with.  Very happy with the price, & managment  of the device getting to us. Thank you!
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie stayed on point and went full blast from the beginning. The best part about this movie, is that it didn't come off cheesy like the first one. It had a focus, a simple story idea, and took you along for the ride. This movie is intense and well acted.

B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie has a wonderful plot, great music and actors, and serves as a walk<br />through history...the ways Tom Hanks life was woven into the old films was marvelous.
B00C6BA4SE|4.0|It was good bought for my daughter she a big fan. She enjoyed it, the movie answered questions not addressed by the series.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I have always liked Robert Downey Jr. as an actor and he is great as Iron Man! I just had to own the movie.
B004FHCH96|5.0|I'm not sure how much replay value this movie has, but it's definitely and interesting watch.  The quality of the bd transfer was top notch in my opinion, and well done.  for less than eight bucks i'm very satisfied with my purchase.
B003UYV08E|5.0|It is a great action movie, and great music in it! Tony Stark is such a bad ass! Robert Downey is one of my favorite actors.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Science fiction, space, and history intersects and evolves into one of the best dynamic sleepers of the decade.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Powers that be must have paid Disney a lot of hush money to withdraw this movie's ad and distribution funding.
B003VANOFY|5.0|the headphones are amazing, i just wish they could provide some kind of adapter that makes it work on my phone
B00004RF9I|5.0|I'd heard many positive aspects surrounding this movie, and it exceeded my expectations.  It is one of the best delivered, well acted scripts, I've ever witnessed.  The complete package of great script writers, directors, producers, and actors have memorialized this film.  A real keeper, that can be seen many times.  I've already seen it twice.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|The best performance Ive seen from him since American Beauty.  He is such a sleezeball, totally awesome, excellent supporting cast, Robin Wright is excellent also.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|it was a great experience. lots of fun super heady.  is a little slow though. needs to be more put together.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Justin Timberlake's voice is so hot! This album was worth the $ ! Love his two singles on the album so far =]
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun and very responsive. Good game stupid word minimum fit the rating system though. Stupid stupid stupid stupid and annoying.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I recommend this album to true country music lovers. Great funny, inspirational and moving songs. Love Blake Shelton. This is a must buy album!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Pros:<br />Casting Netflix and YouTube is great.<br />Low cost.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Poor WiFi quality. The only device at home(I have a lot of WiFi devices) constantly complaining about the WiFi signal strength.<br />Except casting Netflix and YouTube, the casting Chrome tab is unusable with serious time lag.<br /><br />Conclusion: The device is good for watching Netflix and YouTube on TV if that's all you want.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Chose this rating because I love this show.  Will watch again and again.  Can not wait to watch season 9.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Charges the tablet great but it doesn't stay attached all the time making it slightly inconvenient Hard to use tablet while it charges with this, the only negative.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When I connect my smartphone to the TVs HDMI to watch a movie or videos, the display will always be substandard even though the signal is HD. So when I purchased the Chromecast, the most important to me was display resolution. What I get from the Chromecast is whatever the Smartphone signal resolution is what you get at your HDTV. So overall, I am more than satisfied for the price and product and most of all the YouTube video lessons I able to digest.
B000002I8D|4.0|This early Phil Collins release has an interesting energy flow to it... intense instrumentation songs, then slow introspective ones, and vice versa.  Yet, he is one of my favorite drummers and musicians... and this early solo recording is one that grows on you... ripening nicely with maturity.  My favorite song is the last one &#34;Tomorrow Never Knows.&#34;  Good stuff...
140006922X|3.0|It was the interview that launched a thousand reviews and several thousand purchases. Yes, like I imagine many other people here I bought this book largely because of the now infamous interview of the author, Reza Aslan, by Fox News's Lauren Green. I have already read several other books like this one but I figured I could read one more.<br /><br />The short of it is this. It is not a perfect book. In fact, the most uniquely controversial thing about this book was the author's faith which if you have at least some common sense isn't controversial at all. Without spoiling the book I'll just say that I have read these points before. Some made in different ways or using different evidence but all in all, there is nothing new here. That's not to say that it is bad, just not as revolutionary one might believe based on all the hoopla this book has raised.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice and easy to use.  Great for my tablet, iphone and my laptop.  My kids love it too.  Just great
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great cast;  Perfect combo of an engaging storyline with understated humor.  Even the bad guys were comical in their own way.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This movie is very entertaining. We all want to see evil beaten.<br />Granted it goes over the top with Tom Cruise taking on five bigger<br />guys, but that's movie magic for you. Acting good, action good, storyline<br />excellent, however ending may have been better. Well done.
B009AY04A8|3.0|very repetitive, find the difference, find the doubles etc. etc. mini games not fun or challenging. It seems if you play one nevosoft game you've played them all! Glad it was a faotd
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book! I was so frustrated at times but then I would be so captivated by the strength and love that was shown!! I experienced every emotion possible: LOVE, FRIENDSHIP, FRUSTRATION, SADNESS, HOPE, EMPTINESS, LIFE!
B008OOYALE|1.0|It would be nice if just about eveything did not cost gold!!! Not all of us have money to spend  or neighbors to beg for gold!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love American Horror Story. Asylum wasn't as good as the first season but it was still better than everything else on TV. Can't wait to see Coven.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|An excellent piece of literature. If you love fantasy and romance this book is going to be great for you.
B005PK553C|5.0|I started watching and felt uncomfortable and scared. Then I realized &#34;Hey, I love horror and I have never felt this way! This ish is awesome!&#34; Asylum was good but not as good. Can't wait for Coven.
0618680004|1.0|i was given this book as a gift.  i am surprised at the illogic of this very gifted thinker.<br />he says he will disprove the existence of God.  then he attacks the bible, pointing out errors, inconsistencies, and contradictions.  having done a good job of doing that, he then steps back beaming and says, 'therefore, God doesn't exist.'<br />nonsense, he has simply proven that the bible is not infallible.  you cannot prove that God doesn't exist anymore than you can prove that God does exist.  it is mystery, not logic.<br />the book could be of interest if you want to know more about the bible, it won't help you any about God, one way or the other.<br />the title should be \\"proof that the bible is not infallible\\" or if he wants to be cute, \\"the bible delusion\\".
0761171703|5.0|This is a perfect gift for any dancer. I bought one for my mom for Christmas and one for a friend's birthday. Both loved it so much. I'm thinking of buying one for myself. The images are so beautiful and inspiring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great Game, Awesomeness Wishes It Was This Perfect.Great minions.I liked the Baby,have you seen the Magician yet?If you rate 5 pay yourself 3,45667800$.My bro won't shut up about minions.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Definitely a young adult book. Otherwise, this was a good story with tons of action. Would have liked to see a little more use of magic.
0440237688|1.0|This book is required reading for seventh graders. I don't think it should be. One child told me she thought it was perverted and I have to agree. There are other books more suitable to the educational needs of our children. Yes I did read the whole thing and it wasn't that easy to finish.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game, my boys age 4 & 6 love it. Just wish it didn't keep having pop-ups for them to purchase points.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Some boring some interesting but an overall good read. I would recommend it to any and all who enjoy fantasy.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This was a good movie. I liked the acting, the story line, and the scenery. I would recommend this movie!
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|my grandson just loves this game he will play it all day if i let him so good job romelab
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I do enjoy this as something to do, but it is repetitive so I lose interest fast. Still, it is nice.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|This is the debut album by a very young band from Tennessee. i have purchased all their cds great music
B004LWZW4M|4.0|THIS PREQUEL (REBOOT) IS EXCELLENT<br />I HAVE IN ON SHELF NEXT TO<br />THE ORIGINAL PLANET OF THE APES FEATURE FILM SERIES<br /><br />CAN'T WAIT TO SEE CESAR IN THE SEQUEL
B003G4W49C|4.0|But I'm so glad I stuck it out I love the different by take on it. This is not my usual genre of books but I'm tempted to read more of Orson`s work
B005K15XR4|5.0|The music these people create is marvelous and inspiring. You can see an example of this on 'Youtube' in the video 'Horse Charge'. I think this will make up your mind.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most creative game in the world. In love all the monsters and items . There is no better game in the world.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Iron Man and War Machine were awesome together. War Machine really made agood addition to this movie. The other two suits were cooler though.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Just discovered Bonamassa several months ago on a PBS special. Outstanding Funky blues music! Have tickets for Ruth Eckerd Hall here in Clearwater for November. Cant' wait to see and here him live! Would highly recommend this to all!
B000BCE918|5.0|Seriosly?PG- 13? Really? I Watched This When I was 3 And I Wasn't Scared. But Still Good Movies. Love Them.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This is a great action movie, never a boring moment.  Photography was very well done, and storyline had a few twists making this movie worth viewing more than once.
B001LM1456|2.0|That movie was a little to boring. I mean there wasn't enough action. And his Hulk form was not cool at all. I was so bored I didn't find out how that guy turned into The Abombination. My point is it's very boring
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very addicting and challenging. It is so much fun to find all of The clues  and figuring out what to do with them. So worth it!
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|Perfect to watch on the Fourth of July. Perfect for that time. I tryed to see in theaters on Fourth of July but it was already out of theaters. I got a little mad and was barely able to control myself but I managed to calm myself down and went to see Thor instead. Still was a little stressed out but Thor was a good movie and calmed me down.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|This game is great. But like all gameloft games the graphic quality is lowered on the kindle fir. There's an app called chainfire3d that makes apps think you have a high end device. So the graphic quality goes up. But it requires root. This works fine on gameloft games but lowers the fps. This makes gameloft games 10 times better
B008JFUO72|5.0|Best out of all of them! Aldrich Killian was getting freaky when used his ''The Manderin'' Form. But Still was awesome.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is really fun to help families from your favorite movie. This game has all the characters and you can friend people. I highly suggest trying this game and its free!!!!
B00574P9EQ|4.0|Surprised to say this, but it was actually a good movie. Was better than I thought. Rodrick was so funny in this.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I didn't like it til I really learned how to play... now I love . It!!!<br />  It is all about strategy!!!
B001KZG99A|3.0|Tony is so funny. Would love to see him in a fourth one. Or at least put Spider-Man in The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Now they would be funny together.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My five year old daughter loves this game. Its very colorful and easy. Also free! Yes there are option to purchase stuff but not necessary. I definitely recommend this app!
B003B02O14|4.0|Good story all in all. The end was unexpected and made me quite angry actually but it was a good book overall.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I have been using this while swimming in a public pool. Overall I like this.  It is nice to be swimming and listening to music.  I would have never thought this possible. The only  issue I have is the sound quality changes the moment my head comes out of the water but I am not sure what can be done about this.<br /><br />Charging Unit and Transferring Music:<br /><br />This was easy to charge. It can be charged by connecting a cable that comes with the unit to a USB port on a computer or you can use an adapter that does not come with the unit and plug the cable into a wall outlet. I was able to use an adapter that came with my cell phone so some people will not need to buy and adapter.<br /><br />Downloading music was easy. I have a nice music library of downloads that I have gotten from Amazon over the years. All I did was attach the unit to my computer though a USB port. I then went to My Computer in Windows 7, saw Finis which was listed as drive J, and copied the music files from the My Music folder to the Finis folder.<br /><br />Finding Music on the MP3 player:<br /><br />It is easy to find songs loaded on the unit.  All you do is use the up and down arrows on the face of the MP3 player. You can create a favorites list. You can also play songs in order or randomly.<br /><br />In addition to the up and down arrows on one side of the unit there is an on and off button which also serves as a pause button when the unit is playing as well as another button which you use to program the MP3 player on the other side.<br /><br />Once the unit was attached to my goggles it took a little time to get used to remembering which button was which. You can always stop swimming if you want to change how things are programmed. Still the unit is designed well.<br /><br />Sound:<br /><br />This sounds great when my face is in the water. Swimming underwater is great. I would love to one day go to a tropical resort and look at coral and fish while listening to music.<br /><br />The sound does change a bit from when I am underwater to when my head is out of the water.  Wearing earplugs lessens the difference.<br /><br />Interestingly I have taken the unit off and put it on a table and listened to music while sitting by the pool. The sound level is low but can be heard as long as it is near me. The unit is not designed for this and the sound quality is not great but it isn't bad either.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />My only issue with this is the inconsistency of the sound quality while my face is underwater and while my face is out of the water. I am not sure if anything realistically could be done about this. I like pretty much everything else about the unit.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Though books you can hold in your hand are fun, this did well for my kindle reader, formatting is good, but you'll have to see for yourself what the story holds. I can say that the formatting works well, and is easy to navigate. I'm pleased with my purchase, and not disappointed.
B00E8TVHBA|3.0|At first I thought this was a dumb teen movie.  I found my granddaughter laughing and enjoying this movie so I sat down to watch it.  It has a lot of shlock but to tell you the truth the music really made up for the silly storyline.<br />Watching how my grandkids liked it makes me recommend this show to others.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|It got here on time and was in perfect condition I love it...the movie is great and I couldn't have had a better experience
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is so very awesome & addicting that it is hard to stop playing !!!!!  I am up to $ 90, 783.00 & it hasn't even unlocked any of the locks in the game---whew ! I can't wait to see what the next levels look like.......
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The book was amazing It is just like the classic. It was amazing I can't say it enough<br />It was awesome
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love TWC, and I love it on my Droid and my Kindle even more.  The future map is inspired.  I use it first thing every morning to plan my day.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is Must see TV. Very addictive show. A friend recommended it to me, and now I'm recommending it to everyone. You won't be disappointed; trust me.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I know how I missed this show during it's original run, but it's awesome! Everything a guy could ask for in a show.  It follows in the footsteps of the other great FX series like The Shield,  Rescue Me.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|DID NOT WORK! Talked to several people at your company and no one could help me. Some would me send e-mail that was suppose to have instructions for me to download it but I could never get in to the site or it would take me to some other site.<br /><br />Glenn Mansfield
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|With only 20 cards (4 of which just serve as a legend for the 16 playing cards), some small square tokens, and a tiny rulebook that all fit into a hand-sized pouch, there is a lot of game to be found here. Despite having a smaller variety of card combinations than even a game of blackjack, this game has a lot of replay value. Plays well with 2 but even better with 3-4. Perfect for gaming during your lunch hour or on a trip when you have only 5-15 minutes. I only wish that they made the cards of a slightly thicker stock. The quality is far from bad but for a 16 card game, they could've used more expensive and sturdier components. I did sleeve my set.
1419705644|4.0|I have been watching the Adventure Time every week since the first episode came out, and I love the show through and through. I was excited to find that they came out with a new Adventure Time book, and I bought it with my Amazon gift card. After a few days it was delivered and boy was I surprised! I thought it would be kind of boring like the video game they made of it, but this book is really cool! The illustrations are nice and the stories are fun to read because it is written in Abadeer's (Marceline's dad) perspective, and there are small notes written by Marcy, Finn and Jake all over the book. I am rating this 4 out of 5 stars because although it is a great book, once you  read the book you really don't want to read it again. Overall, I think you should buy this book. It is a great buy and I will recommend it highly to you!
1589946634|5.0|For those of you who are not familiar with the Warhammer 40K universe, this light tactical card game is still a lot of fun. It has a unique mechanic in that each card in the layout has a facing and a position which impacts combat. A large amount of luck is required (1 die comes with the game for combat resolution) to win this game but you can mitigate it with some tactical card playing decisions.<br /><br />Good quality to the cards and doesn't require sleeves. Scales well from 1-6 players and has a quick setup and tear down time. Expansions can be bought online or directly from FFG but having a varied amount of players and playing different squads helps with the replay value.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|FUN little game that I can play any time while I travel. Easy to play on my Kindle. Does involve a lot of thought.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I now have both albums by the Piano Guys and cannot wait to get the third when it comes out! These guys are AMAZING!
B003DNN0L2|1.0|I tried to find something I could watch with my kids. This had generally good reviews, so I bought it.  Mistake.  It looks like they were trying to get as many well-known people as they could to do the voices of an animated flick.  Not a good story.  Clay-mation-esque twitchiness of characters was distracting.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've already got 3 friends downloading this app..we all live about 50 miles from each other..so when it comes to driving over to one anothers place..we know what to expect and what to wear!!

0143114085|3.0|Set in England, the lead-off book to this mystery series has at its center a curious case. Alice, a new mother, leaves to go visit the family health club as a treat suggested by her mother-in-law. Her husband, David, stays with the baby on the family estate, while her mother-in-law is out of the country with the older son from a prior marriage. When she returns home, she is surprised to find the door unlocked, and when she gets upstairs to the nursery, she finds that her baby is not her child. Her husband claims that she is being hysterical, but Alice insists on calling the police. By chance, Detective Simon Waterhouse happens to be close by and takes the call. Without evidence, it is difficult to do anything but take a statement, but he feels like something is off in the house. When the Alice and the baby disappear several days later, the case is re-opened. We see that while Simon is bright and a good detective, he has some social problems, often smoothed over by his boss, Charlie, who has a soft spot for him, as well as a romantic interest in Simon. We find out that the first wife of David was brutally murdered outside the same home. In flashbacks, we see David's cruelty to Alice and the unpleasant attitude of her mother-in-law when she returns from her trip. The story is complex, twisting, and turning, as Simon tries to piece together what has happened both in the past and the present. While parts of the conclusion may become obvious, there are a few unexpected twists that give a darker ring to the story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game. It's the best free bingo app out there. I just wish they gave more daily credits.
B00957T6X6|5.0|i can't put them down :)...too bad i have to hold down a job or i'd read them straight through
B001AZFO14|4.0|Kurt Russell is always fun to watch do his thing.  Soldier isn't going to change the world but is fun to watch.  The social ideas might be a just a little dated but the message of the film doesn't hold the viewer back from enjoying the movie.  I saw watch and enjoy.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Great variety of selections. Some blues, some jazz, and some easy listening. Good renditions of some of my favorites from other artists as well. A couple I actually like better than the original version! Highly recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app almost every day. It is my go to calculator for everything. Very easy to use, definitely with downloading. And it's FREE!
B009AY04A8|5.0|Hard to put down the game.  Excellent screens. Good story line.  Best search game.  Worth the down load.  Lots of fun.
0553386794|5.0|i am enthralled by the book.  totally neglecting family. i totally feel for characters in this book.  cant wait to read the rest of the series.
B0040I09RM|5.0|So unbelievably exciting and scary. I Just can't wait for each episode!  So relieved about Abel, just had to know it was a happy ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it! So much fun! Is chalanging and you never get bored playing. every room is different than the last
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I did not give it a 5 star rating only because it left me with such a bereft and depressed  feeling of the way it ended.Actually<br />the whole book was a study in depression...I had to force myself to finish the book and then after the ending I wished that I had not.<br />Here is a case of (for me) way too much realism.I do realize that those circumstances probably occurred but I guess I felt the pain<br />of their lives way too vividly which is to Steinbeck's credit.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This games is addictive and you get to play the levels without having to purchase things although you can if youdon't have the patience to wait
0307165485|5.0|The stories vary in length and there are so many choices.  My 4 yr old picks 2 long stories or 3-4 short ones before bedtime.  He loves the illustrations which are so unique to Scarry and so incredibly detailed (even for a grown up to pore over) and imaginative.  This is such an awesome collection.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Excellent read but a little repetitious, the 'macho man' push was a bit heavy but the story itself was very good and I enjoyed it.
B000HKYN74|5.0|Star Trek: Enterprise is a must see for those that enjoy those TV shows that came after the original Star Trek. This series has a special, supportive comradery that pulls the viewer in. I enjoyed this show when it was on TV and I have recently enjoyed it again, watching it on Amazon Prime. This is out of this world.
B009AY04A8|1.0|Luckily this was a free game of I would demand my $$ back. Way too much talking and couldn't get past the second room due to the placement of one object too close to the edge and couldn't select it, had to stop.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|I really like this movie. It is good for the whole family. For young children, it is a little slow at the start. Rango doing plays in his cage, but once he makes it to town it will hold their attention too.
B000031EGV|4.0|My kids are young girls.  They absolutly love this movie, and i dont mind watching it with them.  They often try to imatate it's characters, especialy Alan.  They will go out and try to dig up something talking about they found Jumanji.  There is a house on our nomal route that they describe as Alan's house.  It could be a little much for some children, but mine have always liked intense movies.  I actually have a board game by the same title, but my copy dosent play drums or suck people into it.<br /><br />Movie summray (no spoilers)<br />Some kids bury something they are obviously scared of.  The item beats drums that only the people it picks can herar.  Years later Alan (12 year old boy) heras the drums and finds a board game.  The inscription reads, &#34;a game for those who seek to leave thier world behind.&#34;  This describes Alan, so he drops the pieces on the board, the game then can interprt the dice reading and move your pieces.  The game begins to come to life, sending creatures after the players and even sucks poor Alan into the jungle of Jumanji.  Still years later, more children move into Alan's old house and find the game.  They realize that if they finish the game, all of the bad things will go away.  After freeing Alana from the jungle, they do just that. (Alan never finished the game, so they are playing the one he started.)  Several interesting things happen as the game progresses, from gigantic mosquitos to a stampeed of jungle animals.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|My opion is that I been a fan of this comic book since the 90's and to see \\"finally \\" a film that show the real comic book as it is, I give this Movie 5 stars all the way because the director saw the film in its real from. Not just for it actors but it true Comic book Charaters is.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Because so little is known about Jesus, (or can be corroborated with non-canonical texts) the author takes the Gospels and other related texts to present Jesus the man in the context of history.  Much of the book is knowledgeable conjecture...i.e. a Jewish man at that time would be expected to act this way or do these things.  Or, we know these facts about Herod or Pilate so this is what probably happened. The book goes on to relate the development of Christianity.  Well-written & researched.  This is not about &#34;the divinely inspired Word of God.&#34;  Leave all preconceptions at the door and you'll get more out of it.

B004ZN9YNC|3.0|Don't get me wrong...there's some nice moments on this album: Post War Dream, Gunner's Dream, Not Now John. But honestly, listening to this record cover to cover just plain bores me. Maybe the absence of Rick Wright or the fact that too much creative control was given to Waters without enough real collaborative efforts, relegating Gilmour and Mason to mere sidemen roles on this particular project. Like I said earlier, It collects a lot of dust on my shelf.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|'Born to Run' was a very riveting book- a page turner and hard to put down.  As I run I found some of the running theories worth investigating.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I want all of my kids to read this book. Like the author said, choose to be kind instead of being right.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I liked it. Yes, yes i did. Not bad at all. Nice CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN action show. Wish more shows were as clean as this. Interesting and absolutely unrealistic stuff at times, but squeaky clean action show.<br />Scrapes, cuts, torn clothes and muddy tankers...all clean, like supermarket bleach clean. Actually it's more like Pinesol and Clorox bleach clean but who's comparing. I'm talking about started watching this movie with coffee stain teeth and ended up with snow white teeth at the end of the movie. It was clean...so there I said it.<br />I hope you know that the movie is clean...Yes, yes it is.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Is now one of my Top Favorite Movies ever.  It is excellent.  A suprise ending and a nice car.  thanks
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I loved Paranormal Activity and Insidious.  This movie was just a dog turd, though.  Boring.  Bland.  I couldn't get into Ethan Hawke's character's motivation or his behavior.  There was too much exposition for the murders and the demon and not enough actual character development for him to be interesting, likable, relateable, etc.  And the demon?  Bughuul?  Really?  I couldn't get over the ridiculous name, it sounds like a pasta dish or a Scooby Doo villain.  Stupid.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app helped me learn more about weapons from ww2 and helped me find out things I never knew about the browning and bar
B007SGLZP8|3.0|One wishes these facts were a real true story as it almost felt like a plot to win the lottery, giving each of us a dream to contemplate. There is also a bit of pleasure in the little guy getting one up on someone, well done.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|More excellent writing George.  You continue to drag me in, get me attached and then break my heart, but I still can't put it down for long.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed viewing Downton Abbey  this summer.  I hope it does not become too soap opera but it seems to be going that direction.  Playing this series from Amazon was flawless.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved The Language of Flowers.!!!! A beautifully written story of a young girl with a troubled past discovering a gift with the help of a florist who discovers her talent. I've read it twice and loved it even more. I recommended it to a number of friends who loved it as much as I did
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a great book the end was my favorite part their is no more district twelve katniss says Gale
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book as I wanted to lose a few pounds and had reached a plateau.<br />I was as strict in my diet but followed the jest of it, and took the recommended supplements.<br />My six pack is finally starting to show.<br />It works!!!
B00C7L8DM2|2.0|did not put well together, bad acting, the main character was fine but the rest were lame. need a bit more action, story need to connect better.
B000NY12LO|5.0|She never fails to make you see both sides of the story. Despite how unfathomable it may seem, she makes you empathize with the 'bad' guy.
B0040GURF8|5.0|Amazing album. Hands down. Period. 15 more words required. Just buy this frickin album right now. 4 more words required. Do it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Full of action, suspense, thrills, and excitement. Even better than the first book in this series. Can't wait to read Mockingjay.
B005R2N20Q|5.0|I love Deva Premal, and this album is no exception. Beautiful voice, beautiful melodies, beautiful mantras. And not as new-agey/synthesized as some of her other stuff, which I like.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. It was the perfect summer book. It's very readable, not overly descriptive, and it has some action.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Still cranking out moving lyrics, but after a while... it all sounds like the same song. Fortunately, it's a really good song. :)
B001EO748M|5.0|Recently visited London England and was very interested in the history of King Henry IIX. This series showed the life and times of him. Enjoyed it very much
B00821OX98|5.0|This is pretty good. Hope the writing stays up. Love the machine's. But the harnessed kids are hars to read after they are un harnessed.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Recently visited London England and was very interested in the history of King Henry IIX. This series showed the life and times of him. Enjoyed it very much.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I had the free version and suspected that the ads were bogging my kindle down.<br />I bought this version and am happy with it.
B0033H7VI6|2.0|I really wanted to give this knife five stars, and I probably will if I get the problem resolved. It came in when I expected it, but it's so dull it won't even cut paper. I can't even break my skin with it. I grabbed the blade to see how dull it was and I squeezed as hard as I could without a scratch. I've been trying to sharpen it for an hour and I still can't get an edge worth anything.<br /><br />Other than the issue with the blade, it's a very attractive knife with quite a bit of weight to it. I'm going to use it mainly for camping and hiking, and I think it will be useful, but not in this condition.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|I use S Note for taking notes occasionally and thought with this feature set this app will come very close. Unfortunately this in slow and non-intuitive (try selecting calendar object). Good to try for free. Seems like this who purchased were kind of put off by the fact that there will multiple in app purchases to make (free or not)! One big plus seems to be the type of notes aka templates but this is not a killer feature for me. So I'll stick to S Note our Catch notes or even color notes etc.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is only $35 and has changed my life for the better. If someone doesn't already own a smart TV there is no reason not to purchase the Chromecast.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This is for the 1st generation kindle fire. This case is nice and it works great to stand up the tablet to watch thing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My seven year old loves this, she would like to have a real horse but this satisfies her for now lol. I like the realness of this game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Since google newsfeed is gone, this app still works great. I like that it syncs with your google account, even if you do not use google feed...because...you cant.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|One of the best apps out there, easy to use, and great for on the go. It gives you multiple chimes when an item is ending to make sure you get your bid in. Everythng is right there at your fingertips and you do not have to worry about being unable to make a bid when watching an item.
0060730552|4.0|It goes to show no matter our commitment when your life is at stake, you will abandon your moral and survive.
B00001ODGR|5.0|I loved Styx as a teen, and still do. I recently saw them in concert with four of the five musicians in this lineup. Chuck is only playing part time now due to illness. John was already passed, so Todd Sucherman took over drums for this concert and remains to this day. This is a great band with a great sound in concert. If you love their music, go catch the current lineup in concert, until then, buy and enjoy this DVD.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|Don't turn your back on this record.  It's very, very good and certainly worth a listen.  I like the blend of the old &#34;Thin Lizzy&#34; sound as it's bolstered by a new, modern sound. There are a few misses, but it's mostly hits.  The title track, in particular, is my personal favorite and it sets the tone for everything else.<br /><br />All in all, it's already in my Top 5 of 2013.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is total fun! Gameplay is awesome so far and it's 2am and still playing. I enjoy the simplicity and the challenge. Great way to waste time or staybup late.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Take three demonstrated virtuosos and then add them together?  Well, it could be hit or miss...but this one is a hit.  The songwriting is pretty solid; the songs are good; and the playing is insane.<br /><br />Great record.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Great product.  I used it to fix my wife's phone.  I would definitely use this product again.  Thanks a lot.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|If you've not read it, put down what you're doing and read it.  It's one of the prototype Boys' Adventure stories...engaging characters, an exotic locale, and a helluva tale.  This is what pirating is all about.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hard but fun! I don't play a lot of games on my phone but this one is a good one. It's not overly complicated with small items to look for but what is hidden is done well and I have enjoyed playing it.
B000063DHL|5.0|There are some more &#34;commercial&#34; sounding songs on this record, but don't let that idea fool you...it's still very classic (and very awesome) Iron Maiden. Everything is still firing on all cylinders here...evocative lyrics and killer music creates a great record.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|The king of all auto-racing movies.<br />There's only two sub-plots that, for the most part, don't play a role with main story... which is just the 24-hours from a driver's perspective.<br />No added drama for effect.<br />So, if you can't get into the psychology of motorsports, you probably won't like this... or get it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun I thought I was gonna not be so interested in it but it's pretty fun .. so u should get it and see if u like this game it doesn't  hurt to try :)
B000000OMB|5.0|This came out right after I graduated high school... I'm a child of the late-70's/early 80's.<br />Just saw them live last year (2012) and can't believe they're still so tight in there arrangements... and watching Carl Palmer's drum solo is... mind-blowing !!
193700788X|1.0|When I first started reading the Sookie Stackhouse series I thought they weren't that well written but they were fun and easy to read. Did I think some of the writing was absurd sometimes, definitely, but I was still somewhat interested in the situations Sookie would get herself into and how she was given a way out of them.<br /><br />Dead after Dark was another story. Poorly written is a really nice way of putting it. It's as if she wrote the story in 10 minute increments and would stop in between for a month, not bothering to read what she had written on the previous pages. She forgot plot lines and the whole book seemed to be ramblings on characters no one would even care about and what outfit she had planned on wearing for an errand or what type of food she was planning on cooking.<br /><br />I mean, how many pages did she waste on Merlotte waitresses that no one even remembers, or how many Tara pages about her trying on maternity wear do we need to have?<br /><br />****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Considerng the whole book was written about these obscure evil characters that were trying to \\"get\\" Sookie, it seemed to resolve itself by her doing very little, she literally just opens a car door and jumps out. Case closed.<br /><br />And CH makes you feel like Sookie loves Eric in the series, she also writes him as a softer Vampire. Suddenly you get none of him in this book, he turns pretty dismissive of her and she could care less about him leaving? Really? I'm not a Team Eric or Team Bill person, but really, his exit could have been written better, you could have given the Team Eric or even general fans a sendoff for him that seemed more in character.<br /><br />And as much as I like Sam, to have her just go \\"OK sure, you're good!\\" was ridiculous. So she suddenly can no longer read his mind? Could she have chosen the most boring guy in her life or what? I get that she wants something normal, something that isn't intense and full of danger but there could have been abetter choice. I would have rather read that she got together with no one.<br /><br />Perhaps CH just allowed a computer program to write the whole novel for her, it was incredibly bad. Way to end the series in such a crappy way.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|If you like survival distance games like temple run then you will most likely find this entertaining. But thats about all it offers, it does it well but theres nothing else to the game, it becomes just as repetative as the others. The one major thing that shines is the graphics, the suits look amazing, I mean... amazing. Too bad youll only be looking at them in the shop since they cost waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa........aaaawaaaay... too much too unlock. Either in cash at a high price, an I do mean high, as were talking double digits per suit for most. Or your other option is TONS of xp points, which would be fine if the ammounts werent so high. Even 3rd tier suits (which are pretty low) require hundreds of plays to save that ammount of xp. Which is rough since the game otherwise doesnt hold your attention for that many hours of playtime. Your goal is to play for way longer than your entertained so you can... wait for it..... play the same thing in a new suit... the sense of accomplishment wears off fast.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a quick entertaining game that can quickly get addictive.  I enjoyed it immensely and play it around once a day.  Trying to get the prizes to unlock the power ups adds to the challenge.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Couldn't wait to find out what happened to Amazing Amy. Was she gone or not? I can't say much about the story without giving away the plot. Her husband gets a call in work, on their wedding anniversary, to say that their cat is out on the road and the door to their house is open. He goes home and his wife Amy is gone. The story goes back to when they first met and right up to date. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I found the ending a bit disappointing.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I loved the old version. The newer one is hard to get around and I feel like something is missing. The screen is too busy and the ever present &quot;achievement unlocked&quot; bar is annoying. I was surprised at how little battery life I have as my kindle was new at Christmas, after reading the other reviews I now know why.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy the variety of pictures and having the option of skill level. The background music is also great!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love this game &quot;but&quot; they don't give you enough credits you only ger 17 a day for coming back and that don't last long. Power ups cost to many coins.  Other than that GREAT GAME!!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I use this app every time I have my Kindle Fire powered up. The update was not necessary, as far as I'm concerned. But in all honesty, it does what I need it to do.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|This is a fun series that builds of the original SG1 series.  Similar story line is that something bad happens and the team figures out how to save the day.<br /><br />The charactor interaction is good but I am partial to SG1.
B001EO748M|4.0|Good but not for everyone, acting was excellent. Hope to see more of these actors and series like this in this time period.
1400069807|5.0|YES! This book highlights how food has been engineered specifically to make us want it- more and more- and how that is affecting the obesity epidemic while the food companies, who are aware, stand by. It is staggering to think of the amount of research that goes into creating a new food or flavor- from the science of the food to the marketing plan. Anyone interested in health information would find good stuff here. Some people feel it is a bit too 'liberal' in the author's approach- but I think that there is some solid science here.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|This is my first Regina Spektor album, but certainly not the last one I will buy.<br />I love how varied her music and topics are. All are clearly very personal and brilliantly put to music in both lyrics and music.<br />Cross-generational appeal, too: my toddler and my mother both love this album as well!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Another great movie - a bit less 'dark' than the LOTR movies and some good laughs too.  Great movie and highly recommend.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I thought I knew the Eagles until now.  I always liked them but now I Love them.  So much good music and history. I bought copies for all my children so they would know while growing up they heared this great music. They all really like and now understand me? lol  Thank you for production
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|Recycles quickly for the flash and using this battery pack is the only way I can be sure of fast repeat flash photography. I also like it because this unit is not too heavy.
B00CFQMVLS|2.0|This movie has lots of action, but really lacks in content and acting.  I kept waiting for the plot to begin that had any merit at all.  I think he did this movie just for the sake of his earlier \\"Die Hard\\" movies.  The two characters do not mesh.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Doesn't get better then this!!!  Thundering drums. slashing guitars, booming bass, soulful vocals, great photography.<br /><br />They are in a class by themselves. Cannot be touched by today's artists. You can't go wrong with this.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|The book is full of descriptive writing that puts you right there.  The chapters connect the lives of the characters making it a gripping read.
B00ELERCO8|3.0|App is pretty easy to use and allows integration with cloud storage.  Biggest problem is cannot crop the picture to only save the document and not the background areas.
B001DRF84W|4.0|It makes you wonder how far that film makers continue to improve the CGI effects as time passes.  Hulk had fantastic effects in it, made the green giant seem real!  I can't wait to see the effects in future films (Avengers 2, Star Wars VII, etc.)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I liked it. it was a lot of fun I haven't gotten that far hopping there is combat other than that great game
B00538MG6A|5.0|Get Shorty is one of my favorite movies.  Very funny, one of John Travolta's best rolls; Gene Hackman was great also, everyone in the film was good.<br /><br />P.S. RIP Dennis Farina and James Gandolfini.
B00821OX98|5.0|I like the theme of the show... Ordinary people trying to defeat the aliens that have taken over the earth.
B000VHIRZC|5.0|I had wanted Mendelssohn's &#34;Songs without Words&#34; for a while now but wasn't sure which recording to get.  After reading many reviews, and trusting that Daniel Barenboim would do it justice, I settled on this one.  I am very happy with it.  Great quality recording, highly recommend!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great entry level building/planning Sim.<br />Good learning tool for managing resources.<br />Very addictive.<br />Wish more pearls would drop and sometimes its hard to attract new fish at times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for killing time or distracting little ones (or big ones for that matter). Always fun to see how far you can get and the power ups add a little more fun to the mix.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Many will complain about this book reading slow and about the sometimes strange chapter titles that make you have to guess who the person is.  While this is true, if you like character development (and I do for some reason) you will like this book.  What ever stress the characters encounter here I'm convinced will flavor the next book.  I will be disappointend if the next book is as slow as this one or the previous one.
B003N0XDT4|2.0|My built in sound card in my mobile (htc one x+) , in my iPod nano and in my laptop (acer aspire timeline x) are doing better .. it looks like it's dedicated for really old devices to feel the deference.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Good but a bit more pace would have been very goodl<br />Got to get used to teacher's style of action
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good time killer.  Travel a lot and great for the plane and hotel room. Recommended for any one who's bored.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good series. Interesting court cases and interpersonal relationships. Story line develops slowly but characters are well defined and very interesting.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|John Ford's classic is a compelling tale about the nature of truth (examining the merits of the old Machiavellian claim of \\"the ends oft justify the means\\") set in a gorgeous Western. A masterful script gives the only geograhical location as a river, using a name that was a very temporary name for a river in Colorado but according the the flag in the film, it can't be Colorado as this takes place after CO achieved statehood. In a way, it doesn't matter where Shinbone is because it's the west.<br /><br />In this case the west signifies the growing pains of first adulthood, a time for the United States similar to when a person graduates college and stumbles out into the world determined to forge a life and identity.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is supberb, and even the ol' Duke is a might bit more subtle than usual. The pacing is good, the characters solid, and this movie will appeal equally to fans of spaghetti westerns as well as  anyone who likes a good coming-of-age story. A true classic you shouldn't miss.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book.  I am thinking about ready all tree of them again they were so good.  I had such a hard time putting the book down.
1416972250|4.0|** spoiler alert ** Finally! I don't have to detest Jace and Clary's incestous relationship. I knew it wouldn't be, but I'm glad it's finally out in the open. Now I can listen to them drivel about their relationship w/o having to be grossed out by hearing them talk about their sick love for one another. At that point, I can focus on the story in its entirety w/o having to worry about fast forwarding. They may have said that they didn't feel like brother and sister, but that didn't make things any better. Now, I don't mind their relationship because that mystery has been unfolded, which BTW wasn't a surprise.  I liked that Alec manned up and let everyone knows how he felt about Magnus Bane. I loved how Simon became his own man and how he is growing. I can't wait to listen to him in the next book. Simon is just a spectacular person. I like Maya, but Isabelle can give him what he needs. I can't wait to see those relationships develop. Also, I am intrigued by what the Seelie queen said as far as Clary falling in love with the wrong person. I also, liked how her mom and Luke came together in the end as well. Things are coming together! :)(less)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read this book and like so many others the book was so much better than the movie.  Although the movie was great too that just says how great the book was!  I have since read the following two books and they are all REALLY good books.  Sometimes when you get into the second and third books they are not as good as the first but these definitley were.  If you have not read these books you really should!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Saw the Eagles kickoff their latest tour in Louisville, Kentucky  on July 6  Purchased The History of the Eagles a few days later. Both were fantastic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ususally when you start the second and third books and they are not as good.  This book was so good I would find myself having a hard time putting it down.  I just finished it a few weeks ago and thinking about reading all three of them again.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is very fun. Similar to the Nintendo DS version. However I wish you didn't have to buy different characters or levels.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I enjoyed this game as a time killer.  Until it updated, that is.  Now it forces closed unless I'm connected to wifi.  That'd be fine, but I played this when I didn't HAVE access to wifi.  When I HAVE access to wifi, I do other things.  I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it.  Same problem.  Maybe it's time to delete it for good.  At least it was free.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I didn't read this book in school. I'm 29 and started to read it because I had nothing better to read. This book is amazing. I will be reading every book the author wrote. The book has some cussing and violence that makes it about pg13 , the war games were smart, the technology believable, and the ending is great. I have nothing bad to say about this book. Amazing.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|This is a great album. I ordered it for one or two songs mainly, but found I truly like the whole thing.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Have found this app works as well as using a laptop. All my folders are included and I find this very helpful. For me it has worked better than the mail app that came with Kindle.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Lionel Shriver always gives the reader a twist to make everything fall into place at the end of the story.  A compelling story of<br />a mother's love for a  sociopath son and a too innocent daughter.....and a husband who is blind to the reality of the children.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The Hunger Games is not for everyone.  It is difficult to be entertained watching children forced to kill other children unless you are the kind of person who can let go of reality and just enjoy a movie ... NOT a documentary.  Once you are past that concept, this can be a very entertaining movie because it is full of surprises.  The concept is so unusual.  This country is separated into 12 Districts which are being \\"punished\\" every so often by choosing 2 children from each district, sending them into a restricted area and having them fight and kill each other until only one is alive.  (Now that I put it THAT way, it sounds much worse than it is.)  The acting is amazing to watch, the directing keeps it razor-sharp and the different culture keeps you guessing as to how anything will be handled!  This was the first movie out of three, and it is so good that I can't wait to see the others.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This was a good movie. IWithout giving away the ending it has a different twist on things. Pay close attention to it. I am a SyFy and 'End of the world' movie watcher with a bit of Zombie Apocalypse thrown in and this held my interest.
B00640UICA|4.0|It's a fun and quick game to play, I enjoy playing it before I have to go to work.  Pure fun.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I had a little trouble in the beginning to get the light working but is working great now.  I have it in my kitchen to use to put a little light on instead of always having to turn on the stove light.  Works great, and shuts off quickly.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|So easy to use.  Saves on wear and tear and keeps my headphone fully charged.  Just plug it in every once in a while and forget about it.  So much better than the lousy usb charger that came with the headphones.  Highly recommend this product.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|i like this game a lot play it all the time.  really helps to get my mind off of the everyday chores of life.  has lots of levels and unexpected things in the game.  very visual
B000UVT3OI|5.0|He is a great artist! Garth will always be one of my favorites. I defiantly recommend this set of CDs. Great music for all music lovers!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just tested out my Chromecast. I love it. It's easy to set up and simple to use. I like that I use my phone as a remote and it didn't eat up battery life.  I wish I would have this thing in college.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and having it in my video library. I also bought seasons one and two. It's nice to take a trip to England every time I watch. My daughter and I have been watching this every night. I saw season three before with my husband, but wanted to see it again. I was unsure that I wanted to start watching this, but the characterization is so good and believable. Their is also humor when you least expect it. Downton is a story about hope and love.  A delightful surprisingly good production.
0143113100|5.0|This book is all about the hidden aspects of our brain's ability to cope with disability and change in a person's life.  I encourage every one, not just to read it, but think about what is said and try some of the suggestions if you have needs that you brain may be able to deal with.
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|Even though the characters are wise beyond their years and exceptionally gifted, they are so likeable and realistically portrayed that I was drawn into their lives and shared their passions. I am by no means a young adult (have not been one for decades!) but I enjoyed this book so much that all Green's books are now on my To-Read List.  Highly recommended to &#34;Young Adults&#34; of all ages.<br /><br />.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|To the best of my knowledge, there is no better documentary treatment of the Second World War.  It is not a documentary on war in the Pacific or America at war.  It is a 26 hour effort to cover the whole war in both theaters.  And Laurence Olivier narrates it!  I watch it with my dad (a WW II vet) way back in the early 70's.  I'm now using it for an elective I'm offering at a school in Missouri.  Excellent work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|AMAZING!! This is one of the BEST books I have EVER read! I love how everything that the characters go through is real. Their reactions are believable and they actually try to move on and be a better people. They don't just stand there, wallow, and pity themselves. I love how nothing brings these characters down for long, that they conquer all their demons in a realistic way. I love that they truly support and try to understand each other, that actions are done in love and to protect not harm. Most of all I love the title (and tattoo)!! I wish there was a continuation of their lives and not just one in the male leads perspective though.<br /><br />I have had my roommate and sister read this and they both are now in love with it! :)
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As usual J.R. creates an amazingly intricate world that is based (loosely) in some of the most interesting and exciting historical events of mankind, and then throws in his specialty of action, adventure, plot twists, and a phenomenal cast of charecters that you cant help but love.<br /><br />In short, I am a huge fan of Mr. Rollins, and &#34;The Eye of God&#34; is no exception to that!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It is worth the read to illustrate the stupidity of the legal system.I'm glad that I labored thru the story.
B000TDGGRY|4.0|This may be my least favorite book of James Rollins' sigma force novels....however, it was still an excellent book!! .
B007FEZQF8|3.0|Not as dramatic as the show obviously but lays the ground work for the show. The show does deviate a little. Not sure if I will buy any more issues...was hoping it was all in Colorado but it wasnt
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|Its just amazing,simple ,easy ,practical and very very effettive. Its not a diet only but  a complete healthy eating habit.you lose but do not feel you are dieting.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|The movie kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  Farrentino knows how to put a movie together.  If you like westerns I would recommend that you see this one.
B009QW7MQS|5.0|it is one of the most wonderful movies I have seen. it is recommended for everyone who is looking for a cold war situation
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very fun and addicting  takes a while to earn upgrades but other than that very fun would recommend it to friends
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is fun and getting 5 free rounds is awesome. But the game freezes and you don't get a lot of coins from the five free rounds.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|I liked having the hits on one CD, saves time changing them when I am trying to hear my favorite tunes!  They are a great band!
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My toddler loves it and her teenage sister enjoys it with her. The story is interesting and has a great message.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is really good didn't want to put it down. I would recommend this no book. Awesome book. Awesome
B009SRFPQK|5.0|The activities of all actors was absurdly wonderful!  Funny, touching, sarcastic. Quick and intelligent conversations.  A film that must be part of any collector's shelf undoubtedly.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|This movie appeals to guys like me because we love the underdog. In this movie it is Ethan Hawke, the rookie cop who is seduced into the dark and seedy side of police enforcement. Denzel Washington is the corrupt cop that is so in debt to the Russian Mofia he goes over the edge and tries to take the rookie cop with him. When the rookie sticks to his principles things turn ugly. The rookie cop does his job and we have a good ending. Very very cool action! Don't watch this with the kiddies!
B006S053K8|3.0|It was ok just to watch something on a Sunday. It's not that funny but entertains. The good thing is that I only spent 99 cents to watch it. I'm not a fan of KS but she was fine here. I would recommend this movie if you are bored and you have no idea what to watch in a weekend.<br /><br />P.D. the subtitles didn't worked for us. The subtitles started from the beginning when we were at the middle of the movie :/
0345529057|2.0|Firstly, I'm not a literature guy, I'm just a guy that enjoys reading science fiction books packed with action.  There's my disclaimer.  My review is mainly negative because: 1) The books are incredibly slow and have very little action.  2) There are too many stories going on at once.<br /><br />The first book is essentially a prologue.  A ton of characters are introduced, and the characters walk around a lot.  After this book I though, \\"oh man, there's going to be some major action in book two.\\"<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.  The second book has 11 stories going on simultaneously (not an exaggeration), non of which are particularly exciting.  There is one short fight towards the end of the book.  The rest of the book is (you guessed it) people walking around.<br /><br />The third book introduces even more story lines, making it difficult to follow in my opinion.  When I finish a chapter, I have to wait 200+ pages to continue with that character's story.  I'm half way through book three, and there still hasn't been any action!  I want to read about people _fighting_ for power, not politics and sex!<br /><br />If you want a book with fighting, action, and adventure this book is not for you.  Read The Sword of Truth series.  If you want a dramatic book where people marry off their children to wealthy families for power, talk a lot about war but never actually fight, sleep with people for power, etc. then you might like this book.  The author is very well written, but suuuuuuper slow and completely lacking action.<br /><br />Giving this series a 2.  Honestly one of the most boring series I've ever read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book I enjoyed reading this book, it was hard to keep my mind off this book. I would recommend anyone to read this book. All I can say is I wish I had a Christian Grey.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Really did not like this version. I seems pretty hokey it me.<br /> The other one is better even if it does lock up someone's..
0061336459|5.0|To ANYONE who wants to change there financial blueprint I HIGHLY reccomend this book.  I would LOVE to meet T.Harv Eker :D
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|I usually don't review something before it comes out but as one reviewer already mentioned I feel I should balance out some of the negative reviews for something that I have enough confidence and knowledge of to know it's going to be a great buy for people - Especially the fans.  The additional scenes mentioned by a reviewer can be verified for those willing to do a little searching on the net and like the LOTR extended editions they will make an already great movie better.  I'm a big Tolkien fan and I don't think anyone could have put these books to movies any better than what Peter Jackson and his team have done.  The statue and the work put into it looks fantastic - Its theme, 'Riddles in the Dark', is one of the best parts of the book and now movie. For those who are big fans of LOTR and The Hobbit I feel it's worth buying editions like these because this time with 'The Hobbit' it is (confirmed by Jackson himself) the last time through Middle Earth for him and the movie theaters... There won't be any Simarillion movies etc...  It's great 'The Hobbit' happened at all because it was looking like it wasn't going to happen for years.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I enjoyed every moment, very stark and thoughtful. Well worth a watch. Reminded me of Moon (w/Sam Rockwell) which is one of my favorite movies.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|GREAT for notes/lists taking and pulling it up on my phone, kindle fire and computer! And the best part is that it's FREE! P.S. I have only used the notebook part of the app but I love it!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|It was absolutely awesome on so many different levels that an entire family could enjoy watching together.<br />I first saw the move and purchased as a gift for an aunt who had just lost her husband of 61 years and she love it.
1451662432|5.0|It is a wonderful autobiography with honesty and optimism, as well as his love for America. The author has been living his life to the fullest. He has so far succeeded in pursuing his American Dream.  His success is no coincidence.  With determination and hard work, as well as a positive outlook on life, the author is bound to achieve all the goals he set out to do.  I admire his courage to deal with the problems after the huge mistake he made in his personal life.  He did not allow himself to fall apart, but to take the responsibility to face the consequences.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|A very nice new scifi movie, some very nice twists in the plot. Tom cruise did a good job in the movie. Its a very great scifi movie, well worth a watch!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Now when do we get more shades of grey????? I can't wait. This is already better than Anastasia's point of view...
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Would have gotten a better review if would work on all devices.  Works fine on phones but not on our nexus 7 tablets......Which is where the kids need them to work.  Not on mom and dads phones.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|really glad they did this, is a welcome comeback after the over kill with The Wall series. maybe relevant to &#34;coming back to life&#34;.
B006X50OPW|5.0|Presented in question/answer format with short introductions and summations, this is an engaging read about great traders. Scant on their underlying systems (naturally), it nonetheless provides interesting insights into the thoughts and personalities of these men. Interesting common theme of having blown out early, working hard, and persistence. A really admirable group of individuals.
B002R2L008|1.0|the context of this album just does not measure up to past productions and the album New York doesn't either. I hope she gets it back.
B003G4W49C|3.0|An okay read, I will not get the rest of the series based on my experience with the first book.
006097625X|5.0|This book changed my image of comics and the entire art genre surrounding comics for all time.  Scott really outdid himself explaining the history and techniques behind one of the most delightful parts of childhood, bringing it firmly into adulthood and giving it further meaning in our lives.  I wish it were possible to see this book as the beginning of a series, so that I could study comics more under his tutelage.  Every once in a while, I have to pull this book off my shelf and devour it all over again.  Not because I forgot what he taught me, but because I want to be further inspired by his wisdom.  An awesome book for any artist, and not just for comic book lovers!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great app for passing time. Easy to keep pace with and great for just about any age. Highly recommended to all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Please watch Season one and Season two if you have not watched before watching this season.<br />This is incredible, well written, the acting is superb and you almost believe that this is a true story about this family.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|My son, like most kids his age, is very into Minecraft.  I thought I scored big when I found this set!  Unfortunately, the set is really tiny!  The box itself is 4-1/2&#34; x 4-1/2&#34; x 5-1/2&#34; tall.  When completed, the LEGO set is 2-3/4&#34; x 2-3/4&#34; x less than 2&#34; tall!  I think it's ridiculous that this set is priced at $35 ($45 at Toys R Us) for such a tiny set.  It took my son mere minutes to assemble it.  Needless to say, we were both disappointed with it.
B000FA675C|5.0|As with all Dan Brown novels this book is chock full of details showing Dan's wonderful deep research into his topics.
B00CGG5FEM|2.0|My son, like most kids his age, is very into Minecraft. I thought I scored big when I found this set! Unfortunately, the set is really tiny!

B00D5CENXA|5.0|The author did a great job of packing so much drama and intensity into such a short story. You really do run the full gamut of emotions in the gripping read. Five stars!
B008JD7VZM|2.0|My son, like most kids his age, is very into Minecraft. I thought I scored big when I found this set! Unfortunately, the set is really tiny!

1416955070|3.0|Nothing is as it seems.  Cassandra Clare is fantastic with the foreshadowing in this book. I like her use of descriptions and how those play into the imagery of this story. Clare uses a setting that she knows and understands very well by utilizing NY in her story.<br /><br />I liked this story and how it all came together while still leaving questions. I would suggest this book for the fantasy reader. Anyone who would enjoy a story of love, lose, demon hunters, and a world filled with magic
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks always comes through with a great love story in a suspenseful way..I have read every book he has written and have never been disappointed.
030758836X|2.0|I was so excited to read this book, as I had heard such great reviews for it from my co-workers.  While the storyline and setting kept me turning the pages, I was so disgusted with the amount of profanity in the book that I would not recommend it to anyone.  Throughout the centuries, several authors have written suspenseful, riveting 'gotcha' murder mysteries with little or no profanity.  I felt that this author must have a lacking vocabulary if she has to use the f-word that many times in a book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|i love this app it is so cool you can put smiley faces and hearts you can change your bubble color you cantext all your friends far or near
B001608R5I|5.0|I love this album, and it is even better on vinyl!! The Raconteurs are my favorite band, and I love owning them on vinyl.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Pretty cool game with good controls. Gotta love the free app of the day. A tad repetitive, but we'll worth the time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This Game Is Simple But Fun. Not over Done With graphics And Works Well. Just Like When I Was A Kid At The Arcade. Thank You
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|just a simple app I don't really like it I think its a calculator for steal hgfggh hy hgcc nnhg dybbuk
B007AL48UK|5.0|I have really been enjoying this game.  I'm planning to get the other &#34;seasons&#34; I noticed in the app store.  It does take a bit to recognize some of the differences between some of the tiles because they are similar, however once you realize this, it is fairly easy.  I appreciate the different layouts.  This is a great game for those times when you are waiting for something and need something to do but don't feel as if you'll have enough time to read a book or play a more involved game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Cool game. It's a lot of fun to play and it's kind of challenging so it keeps you interested and with the different dragons, it's co to see what co.as out when you breed them
0988178532|5.0|Outview is a story taking the main character,16 year old Nate on a journey between his present and a journey to the past, experiencing the demise of others from long ago. Nate's brother Dustin has suffered the same kinds of episodes and he looks to his brother for answers. Will he find them or will it be too late?  This is a very cleverly written story that takes you on a n emotional journey. Well done. Would like to see more from this author.
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|loved it my child enjoyed watching it kept him very ingaged so the information was soaked up by him good!
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Is there anyone who can write better inner dialogue or pack more between the words than Hornby?  His characters are always more multi-dimensional than most people I actually know.  I will gratefully and enthusiastically read the backs of cereal boxes if that is what he decides to write.  Thank you again Mr. Hornby.
B000002KOJ|5.0|This is ridiculous.  I like it.  I bought it because I like it.  I would imagine people just refuse to rate because you &#34;require&#34; a certain number of words.  I will not rate the next two because of this!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I thought the movie was fantastic!  Even better than the first new Star Trek movie.  Spock is awesome once again!!!!  ^_^
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game addicting. It seems easy but it gets harder I love it.once u start playing u will not be able to stop. Its a hood game to sit down and relax game
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I don't know why I held off for so long to see this wild, wacky, unique movie featuring the dynamic duo of Simon Pegg & Nick Frost. It's well-written, full of surprises, and best of all, hilarious. If you've seen &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34;, you have to see &#34;Hot Fuzz&#34; and then &#34;The World's End&#34; to experience Pegg/Frost/Wright's &#34;Cornett Trilogy.&#34; Well worth your time to laugh uproariously.
B00821OX98|4.0|We kept finding flaws with this -- like the fact that they are pretty obvious with thier 'hiding', but liked it overall anyway.
1476734941|5.0|I love this diet plan.  I did it for 2 months and lost 10 lbs.  The thing I really like about the plan is you don't have to buy any special foods.  On fast days, I just ate less of the foods I normally eat.  This diet has make me more aware of portion control and the calorie content of foods.  I have been off the diet for about 2 months now and have maintained the weight loss.  If I find my weight creeping up, I just do a fast day and am back on track.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really liked the game but thought it would be fun for my child.  It was definitely too hard for my son at this point but he will probably love it next year.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|great way to get netflix on the big screen. Note it needs a usb for power.  Software on line.  great
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This simple game stays really entertaining along the time thanks to the challenges and a fair difficulty. I like to have a ride with my minion when I need to free my mind!
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|A very informative movie on the plight of a whale and the community involvement brought freedom to a beautiful creature.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Works really well! No Leaks!<br />Only downfall is that it is difficult to find a charger that will fit with the case seal so it is slightly inconvenient.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I loved everything about this movie.  It is a good old fashioned love story told through a frog and a Princess! Hats off to the Disney company for their first entire colored animated cast.
0739365681|4.0|I like the character.  Although the storyline soemtimes gets a little out of reason, it's good to follow and has a number of surprises.<br />Yes, I would recommend it.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I liked the fact that everything did not go as planned that Tom Cruise could not do everything flawlessly and that there were issues but they over came them.  The action footage was great, JJ did a great job with this one!
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining!  It has a great story, nice graphics and many puzzle type games.  It includes find the differences, find matching pairs, puzzle pictures, word scrambles, and of course hidden objects.  I really enjoyed the game and am looking forward to finding part two of it, because like I said the story line is great but left me hanging on what would happen next.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes puzzle games.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved this series.  Read it twice.  It grabs you and keeps you.  Interesting all the way.loved the people interaction.  Touching all the way.
B00D3ZJB1S|4.0|If you're looking for new but classic Black Sabbath,, then this is it.  I really like the album overall, especially the bonus disc but it gets a little repetitive.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|Diary Of A Wimpy Kid is about a kid in Middle school, named Greg Heffley, trying to fit in with the the cool kids. All he wants to do all Summer is  stay inside playing video games, drinking soda and eating junk food with the curtains closed. On the other hand, his mother wants this Summer to be a joy filled summer.She wants it to be a family filled Summer! Greg has two brothers, Rodrick and Manny. Every morning his dad wakes him very early. In this book Greg also goes to the beach with his frenimie, Rowley Jefferson. They hung out all that summer, Rowley belongs to a country club.
1781162646|5.0|For those who love Stephen King, this is another tale bound to pull you in.  I liked the retro feel of the story and holding a book, instead of my Kindle, for a while.
1400034205|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. One might not like all the characters, but it portrays them quite honestly.<br /><br />I highlighted a bit. I disagree with some of the Hindu beliefs, but there are a lot of spiritual insights if you dig them out.<br /><br />There is one section where Larry discourses on his beliefs. Some might feel that this slows down the story, but others might get something out of it. The author even says you could skip it without losing the story.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad read.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|This is a dum app you can die very quick even your kids will die quickly you should not get it
0143122916|5.0|A most amazing story. At times horrifying, sad, and inspiring, this true story keeps your attention from beginning to end. Most of us, as likely comfortable, non-deprived, consumers will probably never even come close to experiencing the utterly horrible, inhumane physical an spirit-crushing treatment given to prisoners in the notorious North Korean prison camps. But thanks to Blaine Hrden and Shin Dong-hyuk, we can get a sense of what it must feel like to endure and survive under such a horrific environment and cruel regime. As another reviewer wrote, your worst day will likely not compare with the average day the Shin and thousands others endure and still endure today in these camps.<br /><br />This is a story that needs to be told and heard
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Excellent product worked well, really recommend is a good product an unbeatable price, I am happy for this purchase, if needed would buy same product
B008JFUO36|5.0|Just when you think you understand what is going on, bam! You get the shock of your life! It leaves you with wonder and awe!
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Useless, I downloaded it  and tried to load it multiple times and it crashed and says it isn't loaded correctly.
0811879542|4.0|Can't believe I bought the English version of this book. My son's mother tongue is French, and I wish I'd twigged when I saw the author's name. I should have bought \\"Un livre\\" instead, but anyway...<br /><br />It's a good idea, and plenty of fun the first few times around, but it gets old pretty quickly for three and up. My son enjoys tilting and shaking the book, but also sometimes reads it backwards, where it doesn't really work at all.<br /><br />For the price, it's a good addition to the library, but it's not the be-all-and-end-all.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Will not reformat with large font.<br />No book Mark or high light like kindle.<br />On android it is terrible. Kindle is such a joy. I want all readers to work like kindle.
B001BNFR6W|4.0|I love this show and purchased this so that i could always watch this as it is hard to find online.  The DVDs are skippy and not always play instantly on my laptop.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|As usual Lady Gaga does it again. Love the song and the lyrics. If you like her music or similar then this is for you.
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|This one's ok for Guy Clark, which would make it very good for pretty much anybody else.  Following a trend from his more recent albums, he is not the sole song-writer of any of these songs; don't know at all the significance of that, or if it's even worth mentioning.  He's had so many good albums, and this is yet another.  Certainly not among his best, but I would also certainly not suggest that this is only for a completist.  It is worth having on its own merits.  But Guy Clark is so great, and his amazing career has been so lengthy, that there are simply better ones out there.  If you are not a Guy Clark guy, this is worth getting, but no more so than many others.  And if you're just going to get one or two Guy Clark CD's, well, he certainly has more than two better ones in his catalog.  And, by the way, if somebody is going to co-write your songs, Guy, maybe they ought to come up with some new melodies.  Hey that's not a slam - I still love you - it's just a friendly observation.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|An exelent book I recommend all ages. Maybe the pictures might scare some, because I admite it, they are spooky, but you will note leave your book alone until you finish it.
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|Arrived safely and in good shape.  This is a fabulous movie from a great book and should be in every sports fan's collection....as well as every movie buff's collection.
B00CM96A60|4.0|Pretty interesting album from Armin van Buuren - the number one DJ in the world. The album is more geared towards how the EDM scene is evolving - more crossovers or combination of different genres to produce a track. But Armin still kept the feel and the sounds of trance with every track. My favorite tracks on the album are Intense, Beautiful Life, Sound Of The Drums and Last Stop Before Heaven.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it you will to. I love how you can go to places and their is stuff in the levels. I give 5 stars.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|Game is good - you really have to use your brain to figure it out but once you reached the 10th door - you are on a dead end for the games ends
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the whole series and has read the whole series 3 times and I am11 years old but all the blood and guts doesn't really<br />Freak me out or anything
B0036BK6MW|3.0|I found the story to be heartwarming and interesting, but found that not being a big football fan, caused my mind to wander too many times.  I think the book becomes more fascinating when your heart is in the game....
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|My daughter loves Halestorm and we saw them in concert and they were terrific.  I am hooked.  This cd is loaded with a continuous stream of excellent songs
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a great game but to get anywhere or to really use any of the funnest features you will need to make in game purchases . If you don't mind it then get it
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|It moves so slow..  and it keeps wanting to play with my face book friends.  Not necessary...<br /><br />If it moved quicker - I wouldn't be so apt to fall asleep.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I was pleased with this version because it followed the book.  The actors were believable, the sound is good.  Worth the money.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love accapella music... it just doesn't have enough singing in it.<br /><br />Some bad acting... but for the most part... I'd refer this to most of my friends...
B009ICYPOS|1.0|I agree with some of the others that read this book. It is so boring and hard to really get into the story since I was not enjoying the read. There was too much jumping around from one family to another. I thought that since I thoroughly enjoyed all the Harry Potter books, that I would enjoy Casual Vacancy also...not in this case. I would definitely not recommend this book!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|A series where the characters move back and forth through time. A little difficult to keep track of but very interesting and presented in such a way to make the moves in time believable. The series played without fault on the internet, the pictures were sharp and without noise. It intermixes magic and love along with the change in time. The different times called for different clothes to be in style for the different period.<br /><br />We would recommend this series to all those folks that are interested in the habits and clothes of time periods
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! Keeps me on my toes. Every level is interesting and challenging. Just want to keep playing!!! Keeps me up at night playing!
1881273873|1.0|Except after the second day of reading the book, it fell apart, the pages literally fell out of the book. Wasn't bound very securely.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This was a great buy. The case fits very well and has protected my fire from several drops. Great case for,the price
B005V5WBFG|4.0|I had another program and they tried to rip my mother and I for over 500.00.<br />I now have McAfee for all the computers and tablet and found that it was real easy<br />to set up. Thank you. I should have stayed with you in the first place.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|There are very few albums that I listen to straight thru without skipping a single song and this is one of them. Bruno Mars doesn't have any bad songs on this album. Bruno Mars is one of the best singers, songwriters out there, and he is amazingly talented and is a great performer especially when you see him live in concert.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This was a great Saturday night flick! It was hilarious and had a lot of comparisons to real-life pregnancy and childbirth. There was some language, but overall a cute show.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|This is a must, Susan sings beautifully on this cd. The music is a bit of everything, from hard edgy blues to funky R&B, to ballads. This is one of those cd`s that the more you listen to it the more it grows on you.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I became absorbed in this book almost instantly. I was not sure if I wanted to start this book since I have never been a fan of King's weird horror stuff. I loved this book feeling a wide range of emotions as I empathized with each of the characters in many harmonic ways.
B007P2DQJI|1.0|just got a new battery today, and after full-charge. it's working only half day.<br />the drain battery speed is incredibly quick. It's hard to call usable, definitely I don't recommend this product at all
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Kids of all ages love this pool! Wonderful and cute. Lots to do and kept the kids busy and happy.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|If you enjoy novels like The Hunger Games, this light, easy read is right up your alley. The characters are not as compelling as Hunger Games, but the story is unique and interesting. Read this one on the beach!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm working my way through the series. Awesome.  I can't wait for the next season of the show on HBO.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|just awesome...recommended a 100%!!!!!<br />I'm waiting for seson 3....hope it will be as good as the first two ones...just great!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Tesla is largely forgotten in public schools.  Book does well to review his accomplishments while stirring your own use of creativity .
B0014JKJJI|4.0|For the price they are really good and even more if you just want to save a couple of bucks. What I did was put some nice insoles and you are going to be good to go. Bought them 9 and I'm 9.5 and they fit good and also the insole will give you more support if you need them a little more tight.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It would be helpful to have read &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; first (WWI history) because many of the characters or their relatives carry over to this book. Although the first book had more factual detail, the second book was still a good read as learning the history behind the wars through character development  is much more enjoyable than just getting facts and figures.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Was very excited to see this movie and I must say it was a bit of a let down. I wouldn't waste your time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a fun distraction that had equally challenging and easy puzzles!  Look forward to being challenged in future installments of this game.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun, fast paced.  Wants you to purchase more time but if you go back to the game later it will have refreshed your amount and let you play again.  Would prefer they give you more lives but it's fun and simple to play
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I love this game. It is easy to use, fun and addictive. I play it almost everyday. It has different levels. The higher you go the more challenging it is.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|This app is for kids who want to draw easily. I was deceived by the look of the app, and was confused once I bought it. You can NOT draw what is on the cover of this app, nor can you draw what is in the description. Do not buy this app expecting what I did. I want my 99&cent; back.
B005I548B4|4.0|I found this book easy to read, relaxing and I enjoyed the story. I love Nic Sparks so if you enjoy Sparks books, you will enjoy this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's so smooth and  I can easily find all my documents. I love it. The colors and everything. I have never lost a document and evermore has never glitched up on me. Also I like how it dates the document so you know when you wrote it.
B002RI90WM|5.0|Garth Stein is a genius - of course, so is Enzo  ;-)  This story told from the point of view of Enzo, the golden retriever cross, is the most wonderful insight into the life and thoughts of our best furry friends. So beautifully written, with so many lessons for all of us, it is the best book I have ever read and is a MUST READ for all animal lovers!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love littlest pet shop and my fav is sunil and there is 5 things great for kids on this app!<br />1. Kids can explore the world of their favriote pets from the tv series.<br />2. It has SO much to do every second! Your little ones won't get bored!<br />3.They can also go to other worlds and send stuff to friends!<br />4.It shows kids how to be responsible and take care of pets! And<br />5. It lets kids imaginations  grow!
0307476073|1.0|I will admit, what kept me reading was I assumed there would be some kind of redemption for this self absorbed woman.  Nope.  She admitted to numerous one night stands (she packed condoms!), heroine, abortion, animal cruelty, adultery, and cannibalism (of her own mother!), and grandiosity (she didn't even through hike the PCT).  I kept thinking by the end, she'd exhibit some sort of transformation.  If she did, it wasn't in the book.  Although, she didn't sleep with the the guy at the ice cream shop at the end of the trail.  I guess that's progress.  I was disappointed in the book and embarrassed for my gender.  What was Oprah thinking (although she did support Obama)?  Oh well, maybe my next book will renew my faith in humanity.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I thought instagram was best app but then I saw a mlp app and I FREAKED!!! I LOVE my little pony especially rarity! Like this if u love this app too!!! Also my gameloft live account is: rarity_official__ PLEASE add me!!!:) well it's great for kids and adults alike and its FREE!!!! Well hope this was helpful!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Solid game.  Will pass the time for a short period of time. Definitely reminds you of the old school missile command.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I laughed, I cringed, I simply loved this book.  So many ideas intertwined with solid, sage advice.  Nice work James!
B009AY04A8|3.0|This is an ok game...somewhat repetitive and a bit simplistic but still good. Absolutely NO issues with downloading on my Kindle Fire 1st gen.  Biggest plus - although there's a lot of dialog the writer actually speaks English fairly accurately. I got this one Free and think it's a little pricey at 3 bucks. Plenty of hints and skips if needed.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|...this girl is kind of fun, as are her friends.  However, it's not believeable that a girl with this much on the ball, and able to survive the riors of her life, would continue to be lured into meaningless sex with a boy who treats her so lightly.  She has much more substance, and he has so little.  Maybe she'll wake up, but in the meantime, its not believeable.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I played this game on the PC a few years ago, and enjoyed it back then. Good to see that last little has changed (at least so far...). I actually don't mind the dialogue and story line. Some times it is good to relax,  laugh a little, and enjoy simple hidden object fun. Nice to be able to disable th e countdown timer, if you want to.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Character development not so good.  A little history behind the majors missing.  Story line somewhat plausible.  I would have ended it a little different.  Sam Jackson character conversion maybe or taking over the household for the betterment.  Oh well...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is fun to play, the graphics are awesome, and it's free! What's not to like? I recommend it! Try it you won't be disappointed!!
030759565X|2.0|Not very good, rather unimaginative. Nothing new, nor many cookable items, not many I would be enticed to try. I would return the book if I could and would not recommend at all! I gave a two star rate because one star would mean &#34;I hate it&#34; which is not the case. Let´s say that it was a mistake...
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is more of a question than a review. I really wanted to get this edition for Halloween viewing and noticed Amazon was sold out. Is the Ultimate Edition out of print or will you guys be restocking? Let me know.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|fun and gritty...a bit shocking in some places but its a Judge Dredd movie so really...what do you expect. Its good!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|So far I have enjoyed the game very much. It is irritating that they take twenty seconds off for random tapping though. I am only on the third level but like it thus far. As I get to higher levels we'll see if I still enjoy it.
B00932AA5G|5.0|The book was marvelous, the author is one of my faves...recommend this to anyone. Read all the other books too.
B000FA5STS|5.0|I'm overwhelmed.  David Baldacci keeps you on the edge.  Definitely a suspenseful read.  I'll be reading more of his books.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Mud is simply the best film I've seen this year, period. I loved all the well-developed characters. Michael Shannon is one of my favorite actors and though his role was only as a side-character, he made the \\"Crazy Uncle\\" Galen shine! And of course, Matthew McConaughey dirties up real good for the role of a lovable criminal. Great coming-of-age in the South fun!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I purchased the book for my daughter to read as a requirements for school. I read other reviews saying this was not a good book, but much to my surprise, my daughter liked it.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|A true classic movie on WWII, based on true evvents. Some liberties  and artisic liscense are taken...to be expect. But very well done
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|love the walking dead (Both comics and TV Show) and when i saw that the pre-order price was down to 24.99 i had to buy it. its been in my wish list since its been announced and i was waiting for it to go down in price but i would have thought it would have taken a few more months or longer to get this kind of a price. I just hope that the deleted scenes and all the extras are good.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|And that's all I'm going to say about it..... I liked it, the plot was something I have never seen before ....... so go for it
B007BVOEPI|4.0|They must have a huge budget for this series because the sets and costumes are fabulous! Very well done and so different than anything else out there. I have a feeling there are going to be lots of copycat series now. It's like Grimm on steroids!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the flawed and relatable characters and the way the story was revealed little by little.  A great read whenever!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|In Season 2 they expand out and we get to meet new people groups and characters. Justice is swift with beheadings happening without a trial. Love the characters and the costumes are great! Kaleesie is so beautiful and grows into a strong and courageous woman this season. Can't wait for it to start again!
1476734941|3.0|I thought it would have more recipes.  I can use the few it offered, but it's not going to be overly helpful
B00DU74U74|3.0|Like the Twilight series, the thing readers liked most about the books are the way you really get to know her characters.This is difficult to translate into a movie, especially in an hour and a half. I'm a big fan of Scifi and I felt they could have done a lot more to explain the aliens views of things and their past. If you read the book you can fill in the gaps but if you haven't,  you will probably be disappointed. To me, the most imoortant part of the story was the host changing the way she felt about what her race was doing and standing up for what was right and that seemed almost to be an afterthought in the movie.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|An in depth narration of the continuing story by a handful of characters.  Allows you to understand on a deeper level and, as always, some stunning plot turns.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Kirk was bound to meet Khan at some point in the new movies.  I must admit I was slighty disappointed.  The reason is I didn't feel the same tension between them nor does Khan's group of engineered superhumans play as key a factor.  That said it is still a very entertaining movie so I only subtracted one star.  If you enjoyed the first of the new Star Trek movies, you will probably enjoy this one as well.  All the key characters are back and for the most part doing what you'd expect.  Two exceptions, one is some explanation on some things that puzzled us in the TV series (Section 31, etc.), and Scotty gets in a snoot over weapons he doesn't have the specs on being brought aboard the Enterprise.  So much so he leaves, but don't count him out.  You know Scotty, he works miracles.  Well worth a rental.  I bought the Amazon Instant version so I could see it before the DVD release.  My wife and I watched it twice over the weekend.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B002PMPTIO Star Trek (2009)]], [[ASIN:B005HEEE8I Space Seed [HD]]], and [[ASIN:B000I3SYEI Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found it well written. The historical reference to the varying social environments of the bible makes it worth reading for anyone. &#34;it was nice to have extra information filled in around major events.
B00BEIYMTW|1.0|Okay let me first say if Disney needed to come up with a new idea I could have written them a story that wasn't \\"Cars\\" all over again.  What were they thinking making it another movie about racing?<br /><br />Recommendations:  [[ASIN:B005ZMUQCK Cars]], [[ASIN:B0049INC0O A Bug's Life]], and [[ASIN:B005ZMV2EQ Toy Story]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  I love the use of the English language in describing the emotions.  One of my favorites.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this Book. Hard to put down. Written well and couldn't wait to pick it back up and finish it.
1401942601|5.0|I felt guided to purchase this deck, even though I have many, many Oracle card and Tarot decks. I was not familiar with how flowers could help me intuitively before I saw this deck, and figured it would be an opportunity to learn more about flowers and the intuitive guidance they can offer.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that my favorite flower, Peony, did not make the deck, and my heart sank a bit when I opened my deck and was seperating cards and only saw Sweet Pea (a great card), but not Peony. The benefit, however, is that there are several flowers I've not yet heard of, and thus am looking forward to learning more about.<br /><br />This is a beautiful deck of Oracle cards, and I appreciate you, Robert, and all that you are teaching others about how Flowers can provide value to their lives.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Something to read sometime in your life DEFINITELY!  A wonderful book really; go in depth with it.  Wonderfully written.  Absolutely.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Had to completely reset my device because this app corrupted it. Lost all my data that wasn't backed up. Was great for a while but not anymore. Don't download!
1611134900|5.0|This was a true Nicholas Sparks novel. Makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and mostly makes your heart happy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works most of the time but gets slow when Wi-Fi is overloaded. Also, it does not like when you are multi-tasking by try to work using VPN connection and watch a movie. Hope to see enhancements and more features soon.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is laugh out loud funny! I love music and the comedy cannot be beat. Its a must buy!
B00005JPGO|5.0|This arrived quickly, and in good condition from the seller. As for the story, that is all a matter of opinion, and so I would suggest watching it to form your own. I personally enjoyed the plot.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|His thesis that Jesus was an uneducated, zealot, day laborer who was not fundamentally different from others in this period claiming to be the messiah is reasonable.  I think he presented a plausible argument for that thesis.<br /><br />However, he never answers the primary question:  “Why Jesus?”<br /><br />Out of all his examples of those claiming to be the messiah he never really makes the case of why Jesus was ‘selected’ by the gospel writers to be the messiah.  He conveniently disregards the claims of resurrection as not a matter of history but a matter of faith.  This immediately becomes problematic because it eliminates the reason that the gospel writers recognized Jesus as the true messiah.<br /><br />3 stars for historical research and minus 2 stars for “cherry picking” his conclusions.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|I wanted to like this movie. I actually bought into the first one and wanted this one to be just a good. Too bad it wasn't. I wanted to go along with the premise but the main thing was the total mis casting of Khan. Wow, they could have really done something here and they really missed the mark. It was just like watching another spock type character instead of someone macho. Second of all, what is with them all crying all the time? Really? What a bunch of cry babies. The switch of roles between spock and kirk was ridiculous. Nothing about the character development this time rang true. It was so tiring to watch. I had to put it on pause and go back to it later. The switching of roles was just to much and making everybody a crybaby was really sad. I don't even want to discuss the fact that we apparently are having relationship discussions during a battle scene. Really? So sad. Just so very sad.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|It is NOT compatible with the Kindle fire.  It showed it in the \\"Account\\" section as having downloaded but it is NO where to be found and it is not because I do not know how to open it.  It later came up with a message that it was NOT compatible with Kindle Fire.  On the information about this app. it states that it is compatible........but it is not. I purchased it a couple weeks ago and it did not work so I deleted the app.  all together and tried it again today and it will STILL not show up on the Kindle.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles is a treasure by himself, but with others joining in, it is unbelievable. Great artists sing the duets, of great songs. What's not to love?
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Should be able to choose either the telescopic view or the binocular view.<br />For myself only, I prefer naked-eye (binocular) view.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I really like the game, but do not care for the fact that the only way to play more levels or unlock alternate skins is to buy them.  The basic levels can be cleared fairly quickly leaving you with not much else to do.
0446569895|3.0|was expecting hard cover as that is what I put in the search box...should have looked more closely at the description...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I'm so hooked. Who's really who? Who's lying and who's telling the truth? What abilities does everyone have? Who's going to stay human? There is so much to this complex book. I can already tell that every book is going to give us a little more answers and leave us with a lot more questions. I can't wait to find out the truth about Clary, Simon, Jace, Luke, Valentine, Isabella and Alec and more...
1416955070|3.0|I Bought this for my daughter to read over the summer.  She is reading the series and really enjoying it.  having not read it myself I cannot comment on the content.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Really enjoyed book 2. I'm so hooked. Who's really who? Who's lying and who's telling the truth? What abilities does everyone have? Who's going to stay human? There is so much to this complex book. I can already tell that every book is going to give us a little more answers and leave us with a lot more questions. I can't wait to find out the truth about Clary, Simon, Jace, Luke, Valentine, Isabella and Alec and more...
143352869X|3.0|I like the look of this Bible, numerous maps throughout its pages, book introductions, and the fact that it is an ESV. However, for a study Bible, I find the Ryrie or MacArthur study helps much better. It is also so big, I have had a hard time finding a Bible cover to fit it so I am still carrying in the box. I do feel I have to protect it, because I have found its imitation leather marks up very easily. Probably the most disappointing thing about this Bible, is that I can't really use the online stuff as it promotes. I contacted Crossway, and they gave me a way to do it manually, but if I still can't register then I can't access all the full benefits.
B001NLL93W|5.0|First of all if you haven't started at book 1 for this series and to know what's going on that is what you need to read first.  This book had so many twists and turns.  I do get irritated at Clary and Jace's relationship...do relationships have this much drama?  But Cassandra Clare has gotten us so hooked on not only those 2 but also all the other characters and the new ones as they come into play.  My questions in this book to keep it spoiler free were...Who is Sebastian really?  Seems to good to be true, so is that the case?  Is Hodge really a good guy and did he care about the kids he helped raise and teach?  Will Clary's mom ever wake up?  On to book 4!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is aVery great way to pass the time and I love the om nom so freaking adorable yup yup
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Was received in a normal time frame as stated by Amazon. I was lucky that it got to me in good shape since the package had been crushed. The case was crushed, but the DVD itself was in good shape. Can't blame it on the vendor, it was the post office that handled it so rough.
159463176X|5.0|I know Khaled personally and have read all of his three books. His command of english and writing skills are amazing. The scenes are described in such a fashion to make you feel that you are there, in it. Since I am also born in Afghanistan, the themes of his books are obviously familiar to me.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Just got it and have not have time to watch the movie, so I can't say if it will play or not. But as far as the vendor sending it to me ontime, I am very happy and it got to me in good shape.
B005LHOKFS|1.0|I have tried to use this several times while traveling for the last 8 months and the timing is awful. I just deleted the app and will continue to use my phone.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|The privacy issues some have, are non issues. I have multiple safeguards, thus app it's fine. If something comes up I'll be notified. No worries here.
B008M721MS|3.0|Helps me stay in touch video viewing with my family. It does go in and out during busy hours of the day. Or especially on the weekend.
074401493X|5.0|This guide is absolutely amazing ha everything u need to know about the game! Definitely worth the buy! Also brings an awesome key chain that I haven't taken off my keys !!!!!
0615782043|5.0|I bought this book to support great poetry but I ended up falling in love with it. It made love to my soul and kissed my heart. Chocolate, powder sugar and strawberries is the one I read over and over. The author is one of a kind. GPA.
B0034G4OUY|5.0|This movie is action packed. It has car chases, vengeance, gun fights and knife fights. It covers just about everything. Enjoy.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|This movie is a delight for anyone who loves music.  The story is sweet and gentle, and a delightful bonus is the  many musicians who play small parts.  Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay are luminous.
B004WR125O|4.0|This little dongle takes up the only usable USB port on the receiver, so keep that in mind. On top of that, it only is activated when the receiver is turned on.<br /><br />This means that you can NOT use an app on your phone to turn the receiver on, since it's not connected to the network until it's already on.<br /><br />I opted to go through some extra effort to wire the receiver with an ethernet cable instead. It works much better for me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun bingo game. Easy to get bingo cards. Highly recommend if you enjoy bingo. Friends in chat are very friendly and helpful.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just like the classic,  a lot of fun.  Updated graphics and I enjoy the upgrades and repairs. Banana orangutans monkeys gorillas
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great product. It really keeps a nice edge. I would recommend this particularly for camping, hiking, or outdoor survival purposes. Keeping a sharp edge is extremely important
B009AY04A8|4.0|Good game. Hard for my old eyes to see sometimes so not a great game. Too much dialog but luckily there is a skip dialog option! I've enjoyed these Nevosoft games
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I like when some bands try to stretch a little and try something new but this one doesn't really work for me. It's just an ok hard rock/metal album. Definitely not a Megadeth thrash album.
B001L63JC8|5.0|The best of Genesis ever done. There is so much to this album - and the melodic play is fantastic
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|I was surprised to hear some different vocal styles mixed in. I wasn't sure what to think of it at first but after a second listen I was hooked.
034580404X|5.0|These books are absolutely amazing. It was my money well spent if you don't have these books get it! You don't know what your missing.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|I had to re-buy this one. It's still one of the greatest metal albums of all time. This version sounds great.
B005ERYEGU|5.0|I definitely enjoyed the book Predictable Revenue and really like the author's style. Ross did an amazing job helping Salesforce.com generate its opportunities, and this book tells his story of building the lead generation function from scratch and gives some great examples of his leadership style.<br /><br />I would have liked it to have been more specific, but it still fully deserves a 5 star rating for being the course on &#34;Bay Area Lead Gen Scaling 101.&#34; Having built and managed a 5+ member lead generation team from scratch exactly like the author, here are my thoughts on the book:<br /><br />Ross' Vision:<br />1) Don't let the so-called &#34;reality&#34; stop you. (Love this comment)<br />2) Subteams and miniCEOs, cool idea for teams within companies. (Great vision, his best)<br />3) Design CEOs and VPs of Sales out of the sales process. (Hmm, interesting. Agreed)<br />4) The future of sales is on new user acquisition and important titles like VP of Lead or Demand Gen. (Agreed)<br />5) Design self-managing teams. (Good)<br /><br />The 4 things Ross nails especially well:<br />1) &#34;Prospects should earn proposals.&#34; (This is the best line ever, I always say this)<br />2) Always get prospects to talk about their business, not selling the product. Ask &#34;why&#34; 3x or more. (Great!!)<br />3) In 6 months, follow-up on all past opportunities. (Important)<br />4) Ask yourself in order, &#34;what can I:&#34;<br />  A. eliminate<br />  B. automate<br />  C. outsource<br />  D. delegate<br /><br />Some facts:<br />1) &#34;Short and sweet&#34; emails get over 9% open rate vs. sales-y at 0%.<br />2) Responsibilities of VP Sales includes: goal setting, involvement in big deals, culture, etc. (See full list)<br />3) Most inbound leads come from small businesses, not enterprises.<br /><br />Things I found interesting:<br />1) &#34;Send messages before 9am or after 5pm and avoid Monday and Fridays.&#34; (It would be interesting to see these stats in much more specificity)<br />2) &#34;Did I catch you at a bad time&#34; is best intro line. (Hmm, maybe, need to think about)<br />3) &#34;Return on Salesperson's time.&#34; (Very interesting concept and would be interesting to track both to company and as an individual)<br />4) Ross says: don't assume sales people will find deals by Rolodexes and cold calling. (Great!! Yes)<br /><br />Parts of Ross' Process:<br />1) Define what companies are most similar to the top 5-10% of your clients. (Good)<br />2) Voicemail and email combinations are effective. (Ok)<br />3) Create a &#34;success plan&#34; for after product is sold. (Good)<br />4) Always start high 1-2 levels above decision maker. (Maybe. Good rule of thumb, but I don't like the word &#34;always.&#34; Finding influential people is key)<br />5) Free trials - help create &#34;what defines success&#34; and make sure there is follow-through. (I like paid trials better)<br />6) Track call conversations with DM's per day for sdr team. (Yes)<br />7) Always set up a next step with qualified dms. (Very important)<br />8) Need a market response rep for every 400 leads. (Ok, maybe)<br />9) Metrics to track at board level: new pipeline generated per month. (Good)<br /><br />Some additional thoughts:<br />1) Scaling is &#34;not about hiring more salespeople.&#34; (Agreed. Ideally this process would be systemized and automated)<br />2) Hubspot's suggestion on blogs: Participate with others' blogs, comment, and make it a 2 way conversation. (Very good!)<br />3) The trends in sales & marketing are: more accountability on marketing budgets and lead generation teams on ROI. (Yes)<br /><br />Recommended products to check out:<br />1) Landslide - design your sales process for free.<br />2) InsideView<br />3) Connectandsell.com - ondemand conversations<br />4) How Marketo uses Marketo:<br />  a. Lead scoring breakdown. Very cool!!<br />  b. An email is sent 11 min after web form..<br /><br />Suggestions for improvement:<br />1) Would have likes to have seen more specific examples of success at Responsys, HyperQuality or other clients rather than vaguely &#34;tripled results.&#34;<br />2) How important is predictable revenue?

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|It sounds like Sabbath took unreleased material from the early days and gave it modern production. It has that old Sabbath sound and feeling without the tape hiss.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|Enjoyed it. These actors were great. Good pace and it was a good movie.  I recommend it if you haven't seen this before.
087033039X|4.0|This book has good Instructions for many different braids. The illustrations are drawn (not photographs) and can be a little confusing for some steps.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I purchased the Behringer HA400 for my Home Studio. I needed to not only expand my Headphone &#34;outs&#34;, but give the musicians and vocalists a little more flexibility as well... This little puppy works great - Very clean and quiet. It's small, but using a little 2-sided tape, I simply mounted it to my effects bay... Excellent :-)
B0007TKNII|5.0|I already have the soundtrack, but love the cinematography and performances.  Loving finding my favorites at great prices!  Gerard Butler can sing!
B00CL8D83U|5.0|pet shop boys never disappoint, excellent excellent all around great cd! I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes dance music~
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Fun movie , adults  and kids will like it too. Good acting its a must see get it now, today
B005544TRQ|5.0|Season 1 is awesome! After the first episode I was hooked and watched the entire season in 2 days thats how good it is!!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|An ok game. I gave it a 3 bc it kept asking me to rate it before I finished the game. Kind of hard to figure out. I guess its probably me.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I just received my brand new Kindle Fire HD a few days ago, and was fooling around with it in order to become familiar with what I could do with my new toy.  I randomly selected Downton Abbey to watch.  Once I'd watched only a few minutes, I was drawn into the story and have become addicted to it!  The characters slowly but beautifully unfold, the acting is superb, the film quality top of the line, the costumes and sounds and scenery amazingly authentic and lush.  I've finished the first season, and have begun the second.  I've laughed and cried right along with the characters and can say, without reservation, this is as close to reading a great novel as it can get and a very pleasurable and most welcome escape! The series' five star rating is well deserved!

B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|First of all I would like to say I could have done without the tin box. Other than that, the transfer of these three movies was pretty good. Mad Max was always a little fuzzy in any previous format so the Blu-Ray copy was very good with what there was to work with. The picture quality was greatly improved on The Road Warrior and got even better on Beyond Thunderdome. The special features were a little Spartan especially for an anthology, but I bought this for the movies, not a tin box and a bunch of glitzy special features. All in all I would say it was worth it.
B008JD7VZM|5.0|Me and my son both love minecraft. So when we found out that there were minecraft legos, we were so happy! We build with them all the time. They are small though, but worth it!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|About a month ago I bought a Samsung UN75F7100 3D LED TV set. About 2 weeks ago I bought an OPPO BDP-103 3D Blu-Ray player on Amazon. Of course, I didn't have any 3D Blu-Ray disks to play so I bought Avatar. Wow! If you got the equipment to play this you gotta' get it. Picture and sound quality are excellent and the 3D is only as good as a movie originally shot in 3D could be. I'm afraid that any other move shot in 2D and processed up to 3D will not stand up to this one. Oh. By the way. I thought the movie was great! Hope there will be a sequel. (In 3D of course.)
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|An insightful look into the making of a man & his sons and the art of sushi making.  A good primer for Japanese cultural mores and the dedication to one profession.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is my 2nd review of a movie on Amazon.  I must admit, I did order (and still have on order) the 3D DVD.  But when I saw this was available on instant video on Amazon, well I ordered that one too!  HAHA!  Here is my review!<br /><br />1) Plot:  The plot was excellent and it wasn't too obvious.  The bad guy's name remained nameless to me until just before he identified himself. It wasn't so soon as to make the movie any less exciting than it was.  The plot did take a dangerous theme from Trek history, one that for us Trek followers could have been disastrous if not done perfectly. Some Trek followers might even consider it movie blasphemy.  I admit, there were a few seconds that I thought they had crossed the line.  But it wasn't a few more seconds later where a tear welled up in my eye and was proof to me that it was done well.  Yes, they did it right.  I'm sure the director, JJ Abrams, was sweating bullets the whole time.<br /><br />2) Action:  All Sci-Fi movies should have a lot of action and Star Trek is no exception.  This movie had all of that, and it did keep me guessing about what was next.  There is no shortage of action in this movie, None.  And the special effects supported the action 120%.  From the Enterprise, shuttles, volcanoes, alien worlds, to things that go boom, smash and crash.  Its an eye popping, ear ringing, action adventure movie that just so happens to be in the future.<br /><br />3) Acting.  I rather like that the actor Zachary Quinto that plays Spock gained some weight from the last star trek movie.  My guess would be about 15lbs.  He wears it well, and acted true, albeit slightly out of bounds, from his historical character. But, I suppose that was the point anyways since the last movie changed history right?  Chris Pine, who played James Tiberius Kirk (every time I think of his full name I think of the first movie where the 9 year old version says it - high pitched!) did an excellent job again.  The not-so-confident Kirk is humbled to death in this one and that too is a turn from the historical version.  Everyone else was excellent too.  However, I did think the Tribble was a little out of uniform.  Since when was there ever a  short hair version? - Ok wait, I have the answer.  Since history itself changed.  Ok ok.<br /><br />So, if you are a follower of Trek, you will not be disappointed.  If this is the first time seeing a trek movie, you'll be better than fine, as long as you like Sci Fi, action and good vs evil.<br /><br />Have fun!  I did.death in this one and that too is a turn from the historical version.  Everyone else was excellent too.  However, I did think the Tribble was a little out of uniform.  Since when was there ever a  short hair version? - Ok wait, I have the answer.  Since history itself changed.  Ok ok.<br /><br />So, if you are a follower of Trek, you will not be disappointed.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|The movie had me wondering, even after I made predictions. It had some slow parts, but it helped build suspense.
B00428CPUY|3.0|I only gave this dvd 3-stars because I didn't care for several of the guitarist on the card + there was only glimpses of some of the better ones.  Rather than do an in depth critique, I realize that my taste are entirely different from many others, and  just say the selection of guitarists and their song selections could have been better.  For me the best segment of the dvd was played by Vince Gill and the group of guitarists accompanying him.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game here totally needs a way to &quot;grow&quot; acorns in the game, that would be so fresh and tasty.
B003NX76BM|4.0|I love it when a book can make me laugh out loud. I'm an animal lover so this was a character that was very relatable for me. I never like to find fault with a book that I've read and enjoyed. So I will only say that I could see how she was going to be trapped coming early on, but it still twisted so you weren't sure till the very last page. So bravo for that. So when you read it and if you see it too, it will in no way detract from the story or the joy in reading it. Enjoy!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a bit pricey when it comes to removing stones and buying decorations. Overall though it keeps me entertained.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is my first Kindle game and so far it's just what I wanted: an easy, fast game to exercise different parts of my brain.
0525457585|5.0|I was looking for a birthday gift for my friend, who is a huge movie buff( but owns every movie you could ever think of), and came across this book on Amazon. She likes to read and I know she's seen the movie, so I bought it for her. She was pretty surprised by it. She loves the movie but didn't even know about the book( and that the movie was only the first half of the book). The quality of the book itself is awesome( the duel color print is pretty cool). I'm probably gonna have to get one for My bookshelf.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Great game so far. It is by far one of the most exciting search games I have played so far.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Amazingly addictive.  Missile defense game I've ever played.  Can't or it down.  Lots of upgrades you can do to improve your game play
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Awesome game!! Amazing graphics look great on my KFHD. I think it's a decent upgrade from Asphalt7 . Catching air to gain points is pretty sweet! Just downloaded the game last night.  I must warn that it is a Large File at almost 873 MB...took over an hour to download. But for a buck it's worth it! You'll be enjoying drifting your supercars in no time!
B000C20VRS|5.0|It is my favorite movie. My gf and I loved it....a must buy!! All time favorite. Need more like this.
1612680011|5.0|This is simply the best finance book.  change many ways you think about what money is and how to create it. excellent!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is one of the best build your own town game only its underwater and its all related to getting the most fish
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I really enjoyed how she didn't die and was able to get each and everyone of those back. Most victims usually don't. I'd tell somene about this movie
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I've used this app on Android devices in the past, including my 1st gen Kindle Fire, and I really like it.<br /><br />I just got a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and today I downloaded/installed this app to it. But each time I opened the app, I got a warning message as quoted in reviews below, that this is an unoffcial app and I should go to a specific URL to download the app instead. Needless to say, I uninstalled this app. I hope they get this glitch fixed so I can use it again. In the meantime, I'm looking for an alternative file manager/explorer app for my Fire HD.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|would like to stream more sites than the few available right now, but simple to use, no issues for at this time.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|If you like strong sassy female heroes this book is for you. Good plot with complicated characters. Treachery, romance, mobsters: its all good.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver has written a typically brilliant book about what predictions are, why he likes the Bayesian model, and what the limits of these techniques might be.  This is the guy who called all 50 states in 2012 (remember #drunkNateSilver ?). He is a really smart guy and a GREAT explainer.  This is one you really should read.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The book is well written and imagined. I loved the journey through the generations and the unravelling of the secrets.
B0060QM0AG|4.0|I just finished rereading James Herriot's \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" for the fifth time. His books are wonderfully written and give great pleasure no matter how many times they are reread.  His books are in my permanent collection so I can pleasure myself a s often as needed.  Give yourself great pleasure by reading all of his books.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Actually, the book is more informative and truer than the cable channel on prison life.  The TV series is bent on sensational events that didn't take place or were exaggerated.  The story was easy to follow.  I recommend the read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Like most trilogies, the first book is great, the second isn't as good, but good enough to read and see if it gets better. The third wraps up just enough to be part of the series, but moves slow enough that you only finish because it's the LAST book.
0345522478|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the humor and \\"fun\\" (which seems to be a derogatory word according to some of the other reviews) this book turned out to be.  And it does so without losing heart.  At twenty-one hundred years of age, Atticus has discovered a way to still enjoy life...at least until his arch-nemesis finds him.  He is wise enough to know any alliance has it's own problems, and he always keeps himself open to the possibility of the double cross.  Again, without being jaded.  The difference between Atticus and someone like Harry Dresden (the Jim Butcher series) is that Atticus is thriving.  Despite the constant possibility of pain and death, and having lived through losing generations of loved ones and friends, he still appreciates the pockets of humanity during the in between times. It is the ultimate Zen mastery of life.  There is action galore and fun time with animal communication, but there is also the darkness when humans are sacrificed on a whim.  Through this all, the person with the most surprises is an old Irish woman...a human.  My only issue is with the epilogue as I am wondering if he is going to find proper homes for all the puppies.
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|Great movie, its what Vin Diesel was cut out for and the only movie he was really good at :-) .
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|The movie is great. It is the packaging I was disappointed in. I only received the 3D and not the digital so I feel I paid for more than what I got.
B0000024YL|5.0|It was actually baught for my husband as a surprise, but he constantly plays it in our truck. I am starting to wonder if in going to have to buy him another due to him wearing it out
B000YDOOUK|5.0|These guys totally kick butt. They sound like ac dc and they are awesome. The fact that two brothers are pretty much the band is even more cool.
B005544V6A|5.0|The show is great !!! I have told several friends they should watch it. Will tell my friends that they should sign up on amazon.
B007HO392S|5.0|This is her best cd ever...The song See You Again is my favorite..<br />The first time I heard it I was on the way out to the cemetary to my daddy's<br />gravesite and after listening to the words that I will see him again..Thank -You<br />for such a beautiful song!!! I love the whole cd every song is awesome but that<br />one truly is my favorite and alway's will be...Thanks again Carrie Underwood for<br />your awesome beautiful voice and excellent choice of song...See You Again should<br />win lots of awards !!!!<br />Thank-You,<br />Mary Eichelberger Sheffield Lake,Ohio
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Man of Steel definitely has a Christopher Nolan influence, but also has the gorgeous Zack Synder cinematography necessary to make the CG believable. This combination makes for the best Superman movie that feels as grounded as aliens fighting can be, and gives you a lot to think about. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer forges it's own path with magnificent pieces that stand out and take place of John Williams well known score respectfully. This movie adds more scifi to Superman lore than most and by doing so makes it seem more viable in modern times. The cast is AAA and Henry Cavil aptly fulfills the role of Superman in all aspects. Clark Kent is effectively developed throughout the film and feels like a believable character. In the film they say that Superman's existence will change things forever and redefine what it means to be human. However instead of capitalizing on these tantalizing thoughts they rap up the film with a Micheal Bay style fight between Superman and Zodd that drags on just a few minutes too long. This fight is followed by a smart wrap up that opens things up for a sequel while completely glossing over that fact that Superman is now emotionally scarred by certain events at the ending of the film. This transition feels forced but is good enough to make you partially overlook it. All in all this is a good Superhero movie that promises a deeper message in the beginning and in my opinion does not deliver by the end. I look for something deeper in movies and did not get that, just a great action movie. Thus knocking this down to a 4/5.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you're bored this game comes in handy. Downside is there are only ten levels and they are short so the game end pretty quickly. Mobigrow should be adding dome more levels but I am not sure when. All in all it was a nice distraction for a little while.
0375842209|5.0|I found this book in the teens section. Do not let that fool you. It was one of the more powerful and moving books I have read. I cried multiple times (I am a man and not afraid to admit this) while reading. Each character I felt a connection to and concerned about what happen to them. Even the narrator (though not human) I could actually connect with as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone. I have bought several copies because I keep giving mine away and do not wish to be without a copy!
0446310786|4.0|This book is a classic, and I love it. Explores the controversies based on race and status. Makes your heart cringe and warm at the same time. Love it
0765325950|4.0|Not the ending I was expecting, but still mostly satisfying. There is the possibility of more in the series, but I really hope they leave it alone. I do not want this series ending up like Dune and having it completely destroyed by those trying to make a profit off of it.<br /><br />While Robert Jordan did not write it, his notes allowed the new author to keep the book true to the original story line. I am not sure if Robert Jordan could have done a better job, but I honestly did enjoy how the new author concluded the whole series.
0061537969|5.0|This book is narrated by a dog who makes fun of the ways of humans while conveying such profound messages that you forget he is a dog.  It is fun and emotional. I laughed, cried, and smiled from the inside out. Garth Stein truly wowed me with this one.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|I had heard of moneyball but I was never filled in on all the details of it. It's a system of managing and coaching that goes against some of the traditional stragedies of baseball. The system is based in great part on the modern unorthodox statistical analyses of baseball. The book is thought provoking and also is a lively look at the traditions and clubhouses of the sport.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome. I recommend everyone to try this game. The minions are funny. The missions are fun. And yhe boss battles are great. The highscore list allows you to battle against friends for the lead score.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Black to the good old days of  missile command without having to plunk all those quarters down, nice little app.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's. A cute fun game ...never have enough credits to play the slots but love the free tournament games they are free and add to your credits
B0071XO8RA|4.0|\\"Wool\\" is a very readable 'Hard' Sci-Fi series, there is a good pace to the story and the plot holds up well through the first 5 installments I read in the Omnibus edition. I have a few misgivings about some of the characters behavior / changes which may be explained better or fuller in the later installments.<br /><br />It is a solid read, and all fans of this type of Sci-Fi will be well served when diving into it.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Rhonda uses practices/exercises that reinforce the reality of ' what is'. A great complement to my &#34;Gratitude Journal&#34; which I love, as a long-time journalist.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Would give 5 stars if it didn't force close when i went to other villages or to the shop. Otherwise it's a great game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a pretty good book till the ending.  The ending was just terrible and ruined the whole book for me.  Both main characters were so self absorbed that I was not able to feel much empathy for either. If I had to choose again this is one book that I would have left on the shelf.
B007N8RULO|5.0|interesting, challenging game that does not pressure you with a stop watch if you don't want it to. sanity saving.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show has become an addition to my husband and I.  We hate that we have lost one of the characters that we most loved and I must say, I stayed awake for hours mourning the loss of the latest character!  This show does not pull any punches, the characters are honest (to a fault sometimes) and speak the truth when asked questions.  It never leaves us wondering &#34;why the heck didn't you tell him why you did what you did&#34; - oh, except for the honorable valet!!  Great Show!`
B0064X7FVE|5.0|what's not to like. free, lots of info and they give you points for something I haven't bothered to find out about yet.
1603427244|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I found it to have great tips and instructions. The book would make a great gift.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|A fun movie for kids with plenty of humorous lines and references to old games to entertain the grown ups
0380789035|5.0|I wanted the book but I didn't like the price of the special edition. IMO This edition is at the correct price point.<br /><br />I am a fan of Gaiman's other novel, Neverwhere.  American Gods was a sadder story than I expected but it was an enjoyable read. I would definitely recommend this book.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'm a great fan of David Baldacci and Michael Connelly, read everything they've written . I believe Lee Childs first book is more than entertaining, its almost impossible to put down. Read it in 3 consecutive nights. If I didn't have to be at work at 6am, I could have read it it one night. Very riveting. Looking forward to Reacher book 2, have it on my amazon wish list.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is great.  No lost or misplaced puzzle pieces  I do wish you could change the background so the edges of the darker pieces would be easier to see.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|awesome cd great music, funny lyrics but great cd overall, if you are a fan of their music you wont be disappointed at all.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|It has an interesting twist & good message, I just felt the movie was low-budget compared<br />to other movies in this genre. I expected more from actual plot, but Tom Cruise did a decent job at delivering<br />his own character's emotion throughout the movie. I'd recommend it, I love sci-fi, but I liked Tom Cruise<br />in Minority Report & Vanilla Sky better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I will say it again, I like her writing but there is always something missing.  Some places there needs to be more.....more info.....more writing what is going on in a situation.......I can't put my finger on it.  I feel after some pages, what, that's it??<br />I have more to say about the ending but I can't because it would ruin it.<br />Good book and I would read more because I do like the stories.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is a very nice production for anyone who will not be able to see the stage show. It is much better than the movie.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|this was one I missed at the show  but a real great movie and with lucy liu its a must for me and great price. had to be in my collection. thank you as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I really liked it.It was fresh and crisp and not the same old spin on the vampire story.Loved the cast.
B001MUK7GY|5.0|this was the very best price and  these movies are loaded with so much extra that is was even a better deal and I always wanted to own them all and on blu ray  they look twice as  good thank you for such a great deal. as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy to play game,but not easy to do as you get further along.But simple enough game you don't have to read for an hour to learn how to play it.
B0013FSXT6|4.0|My wife and I watched this movie a couple of times and finally purchased it.  The reason we bought it was that we could not figure out the ending which could have several meanings.  A weird story and the way it is portrayed.  Keeps you guessing what is next.
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of the first games I put on my device and it is the one I always come back to.Let's me play when ever I have a few free minutes or am away from the house for something.
B0064MT1LM|3.0|Cold Mountain o.k. for a rainy day type of movie.  Good cast and acting and the story not bad.  Not a complete loss of time and also amusing.  I would rate it a 7 on a 1-10 scale.  You will have to view it yourself and arrive at your own opinion.
0312965788|5.0|I like his writing and stories; he is a very entertaining writer and tells stories very well.  I would recommend it.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|I have two calender apps, but every time I try to set a date in this app, it says I don't have a calender???? The app doesn't offer it's own calender (that I could find)  so at this point, I'm at a loss as to what good this app really is to me. It looks like it has potential, but fringe to figure out what calender apps are compatible is going to be a huge chore. Good luck!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Nice game not too bad  and.plenty long. Still playing the only thing I don't like is when my time runs out and I run out of energy. It does.seems like.it replenishes fast tho
0802473156|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  If we all got a copy of this book before marriage, maybe our marriages would be better.  Of-course, you have to use the information in the book for it to help you and your spouse.  Using the 5 love languages would also help us oldtimers.  Felt the book would help Christians and non-Christians alike.  Good common sense for anyone. And not too religious for non-believers.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I love this doll, but just wish it was made in the USA instead of China!  Love the smell of it.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|This is a very nice and convenient app for shopping on Amazon with my phone.  The folks at Amazon are smart -- they want to make it easy to shop -- and they succeed!
1421550644|5.0|Mind-blowingly amazing. A phrase I rarely use for anything! As a fan of Nausicaa the movie I had to read the manga and I must say the manga blows the movie out of the water!<br /><br />And it's because in the manga, the world of Nausicaa, from the Sea of Corruption to the kingdom of Torumekia, is much more fleshed out. Kushana, for intance, was decidedly more evil in the movie, but in the manga, she truly achieves the moral ambiguity that Miyazaki-san was going for.<br /><br />The artwork is beautiful and the story is full of surprises, even if you've seen the movie! Though I must warn you now that Nausicaa isn't a kid's comic. There's plenty of violence, complete with blood. There's also moderate profanity and a few panels worth of \\"Barbie doll\\" nudity.<br /><br />Before this review gets any longer, in short, Nausicaa is an excellent, thought-provoking sci-fi adventure. If you love anime and manga and if you love a well-crafted story, Nausicaa may just be the book for you.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|The pieces are tiny but it was fun to assemble. It should be called a microset. It is nice. Great price. Yaay.
B009AY04A8|3.0|This game was fun until I got to level two. There is one last candle to find but it is hidden by the status bar at the top of the screen and I can't get to it so I can progress to the next screen. Glad it was free since I can't use it anymore.

B002S45V32|5.0|I'm 41 and still love this movie as much as I did when I was 15. It's a classic. They don't make them like this anymore. John Hughes was one of the best.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Holy Bible is a great app. It is easy to put in use and the scripture tracking is a nice feature.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been using Chromecast for over a month now & extremely satisfied with it.  It's ease of use & Price are the best features of this little devil. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to stream audio/video content on to your HDTV via Wi-Fi. I have heard that Hulu Plus, Pandora Radio , HBO Go, Redbox Instant are soon going to be added. Overall, amazing product by Google. Buy it & I'm sure you will not be disappointed. Cheers :-).
B008YU0AOE|4.0|The Calculator Pro Free app is a nice tool to have for on the run calculations. It is easy to use and the scientific side is great if you need it.
0770437400|5.0|Well thought out diary from different prospectives from different characters. How a world wide 99% zombie war might be fought and won
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a fun game that can be enjoyed any where and is a great pass time for short periods of time.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I was so glad to get this app on my kindle fire. My mom loved to play this game on her PC, but no longer has the PC. To find it here and allow her time (and myself) to play and just lose all track of time is awesome! Thanks!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I rented this movie with absolute fervor based on the subject matter and the beautiful portrayal of love. I love this movie so much that I plan to buy it at the end of the week. I have never used Amazons cloud before but I am thoroughly impressed. The best part of the movie is at the end for me because it shows how much devotion the two brothers have for each other. Wonderfully shot movie!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would highly recommend this book.  Each chapter took the reader deeper and deeper into the character's bizarre, twisted personalities.  I found myself anxiously turning the pages, anticipating what was going to happen next. Quite a read !
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Used to play this regularly on the computer and this emulates that program perfectly.  Warning - It is highly addictive.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|I love the way these books are written. Great suspense, the characters are great too. Once you start it is hard to put down. And if you can, try to read in order that they were publish. Well worth the money.Thank you James Rollin I have a wish list now that includes many of your works.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Exceptional movie. The acting is superb; story line is what we know of John and Abigail Adams and portrayed well by Giamatti and Linney. Goes through Adams' time in Continental Congress, his relationship with Jefferson, showed him trying a controversial case in Court which I truly enjoyed being in the legal profession myself. Laura Linney portrays Abigail wonderfully. Their chemistry is adorable and I instantly fell in love with them as a couple and adored their children. The music is engaging and the storyline is easy to follow and captivating to watch with scenery and period clothing. Paul Giamatti is absolutely amazing as John Adams. I was not sure how he would tackle the role but he nails it. I have watched this probably 10 times so far since I bought it, I also bought the soundtrack which I love and this is one of my \\"go to\\" movies to watch, relax and enjoy. Great entertainment!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great product, I use it most days. I also like to use the product when I travel. I use it on my kindle fire HD.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Best movie I've seen about Lincoln, although a different story line.  Daniel Day-Lewis if my favorite actor and he absolutely nailed Lincoln.  From his walk to his humor and his mannerisms, I was spellbound.  A few historical inaccuracies did not disuade my love of this movie.  Grant was not cast well at all, I knew the actor that played Grant was &#34;supposed&#34; to be Grant but he was nothing like him whatsoever.  Most of the actors cast were dead ringers for their actual true-life character.  Great music, great scenery, excellent period clothing, antiques right down to the wall paper!  LOVED IT.
B0031RS4V6|3.0|A good coffee can lead to trouble. You don't agree with me? Then, ask Jack Reacher. In this new installment of the Reacher series, Jack Reacher visits one of the cafes in NY and likes their coffee. So the next day, he decides to go there one more time . While he is sipping coffee, a stranger shows up to ask questions about Jack's last visit to this cafe. One thing leads to another and very soon, Jack is trying to solve a kidnap. The time is running out. With Jack's values, he should either free the hostages or at least apprehend the kidnapper.<br /><br />As usual, Lee Child wastes no time in thrusting both Jack Reacher and us, the readers, right into the middle of action in the opening pages itself. Like his previous installments, it is a brisk read primarily because we want to know what is the mystery behind the kidnapping. The success of the Reacher series is not surprising as the reader eagerly wants to go through the journey of finding out what is the mystery. We are engaged because we want to know if we have guessed it right. Sometimes, the reason might be silly. But you don't want to fret about it. Lee Child is in form towards the end when he pits Reacher against the villains for the final showdown. Lee Child is best in describing the action.<br /><br />This is strictly for the Reacher fans. I have to confess I am one by now and I have no idea when I crossed over from sceptic to a fan.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My granddaughter has watched it several times and she and her Mom love the theme. She is 7 years old.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've been hooked since season 1 and look forward to owning season 4.  Love Maggie Smith.  It's an awesome period piece.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This is one of the must reads of classic horror fiction. The story is very tight, the characterizations have depth and are unflinching. It is important to look at this in the context of the time it was written--it shows some biases of that time prior to strong women's rights and women in the workforce. Nevertheless, it is still one of the best vampire stories set in modern times.<br /><br />This book has had at least three movie adaptations, ranging from &#34;The Last Man on Earth&#34; featuring Vincent Price to the modern movie of the same name featuring Will Smith. Each of these adaptations has its high and low points, but do not judge the book by the movies, whether you liked them or not. This book is definitely different from the adaptations and worth the read. It is also fairly short, packing a wallop with every page. If you like horror fiction, this book is definitely worth your time.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I'm in love with these series, watched it twice- alone & then with my husband, who got envolved quite fast & was waiting impatiently for the next episode, which rarely happens to him =) Very intense, very good actors, great visually- just love it!
B008Y7DDBE|3.0|this movie deals a lot with the am I insane ideology and the just cause I'm paranoid doesn't mean someone that someone is out to get me. Michael Shannon's characters have always been a little off and creepy So he plays it well but the movie seems to drag on and the ending is a surprise that didn't.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I'm not even going to write much- everything probably was said before. It's my favorite show of all times! Great cast, great visuals- I think series actually improved the books.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Overall a very sharp looking and well conceived movie.  Won't go into to many details, but the acting is fairly solid, story is pretty good with a twist that I didn't see coming, and the production value and soundtrack are all pretty darned good.  I'd recommend this flick to anybody who's looking for a couple hours of solid entertainment.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I love this album and Rihanna as well and I cant wait for her to come out with another one.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Depressing...too many references to naked little boys.....i put my evelyn wood speed reading course to good use for the last 60 pages or so to help put me out of my misery.
B000JRYOPG|3.0|It was for my girlfriend and she loved it. I thought it was okay cause im not really into movies like this but it was okay with me anything that she likes I like as well.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|this is starting be become my favorite trilogy. The chemistry that they bring, and the moments of truth, makes the two seem so real. truly a pleasure to watch
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I'm in love with Charmed I have been ever since I discovered it and im truly happy tha ti finally got all the seasons and I can watch them over and over again.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|if you're thinking about getting this, I can't figure out why you'd need to read reviews. Either your watching it for school, or you already know that it's a top shelf Tennessee Williams play, acted out by the late great Marlon Brando. how could one go wrong?
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I ordered this CD after I saw their Tour Concert with Motley Crue, and it is AMAZING! Ships fast and in great condition! If you like other albums by KISS, you will LOVE this one!
B001NA6096|5.0|Young Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy bring their A game to this perfect romantic drama, full of wonderful dialogue delivered so well, you forget that its a movie. but the really great scenes are the ones with little for the actors to say, or do(I'm thinking of the music booth scene) This is probably one of only a hand full of movies where, as an audience member, what I'm watching seems so real. that I feel the awkward glances get quite uncomfortable doing it.<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!FAIR WARNING!!!!!!!! ONCE YOU WATCH THIS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO WATCH THE SEQUEL, SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE TIME FOR BOTH.
B000000OF6|5.0|Was looking for Queen CD and this has their best songs from 70's and 80's. Contains Freddie Mercury's best vocals and biography information in the booklet! So glad I ordered this!
B001FB4W16|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this Sci-Fi, Fantasy HBO  series. It has multiple plots, sub-plots and enough scary action to get you right out of your seat. Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer are real life man and wife and they are wonderful in this series. The supporting cast is excellent as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this season/series to anyone that enjoys a good bite in the neck vampire style!
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|this is by far the worst nerf gun ive ever had!! I played with it for one day and the it broke all my darts!!! im returning it and getting a new nerf gun... don't buy this gun unless you love junk.....
0375869026|5.0|I was given this book as a gift from a friend, we both work with children in different capacities.  I am a counselor and am always looking for support in relaying the importance of \\"kindness\\" to all my clients, (children of all ages).  This book is powerful in relaying the message of kindness through all of it's characters.  I felt so much emotion when reading this book, how rare to have a book bring forth such an array of emotions.  I will be passing this on to many people, especially all my fellow professionals who work with children of all ages.<br /><br />Kathy Allen
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game, lots of fun. GGood graphics. Good upgrades. DDifficulty is good with increased game play. Lots lots of fun.
B00009AOBI|5.0|We planned to view several &#34;classic&#34; movies this summer that a teenager could relate to. My 13 year old loved this movie. Positive energy about making a bad into a good. It really helps people see what &#34;bullying&#34; can do and what it causes someone else to feel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My three year old son loves Temple Run and plays it all day. Sometimes it does glitch though. If you can fix.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a very touching movie for dog lovers especially since it is based on a true story...a must see for Akita owners.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood outdoes herself with each new song. Black Cadillac and See You Again are a couple of the best songs around today.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  Loved the creepy addition of District 13! The book was a rollercoaster of adventurous emotions.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is amazing, the setup is short and VERY easy!<br /><br />It works great with Netflix and youtube, there is always a bit of a delay to start the video, but once it is started, the controls are almost instant! The future possibilities are endless for this little package which is just a bit biggerthan the old USB key we used to see.<br /><br />Please know that if your TV does not have a USB port (Maintenance ports CAN NOT be used), you do need to have a power outlet available...which should not be an issue in most case since you need a power outlet for the TV anyway!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Works well, stable and fast. Easy to use. The only complaint is it will not let me paste an address in the add content area to add a feed like I can in a web browser.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It is a good challenge, gives my mind the exercise it needs. If yo enjoy this type of game try this one out.
B00AWBNNAG|1.0|Do not bother installing this app. The app only lets you purchase instructions and they are expensive. A total rip off. I want to rate this as no stars
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|i got my film faster than expected, it came with slipcover,and that made me very happy. It came very well protected in packaging. i was so satisfied i ordered again a couple of days later i loved this seller and will keep ordering from him.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great tool to browse local directories.  Successfully connected to my Linux samba server to transfer files back and forth. Recommend as an essential app
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blingo is a fun game,I enjoy the places I have visited, the music,sound keeps me coming back to play.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Completely replaces my need for a paper sketchbook. I an impressed with how easy to use this apps is and how many features it has.
B000006N7A|5.0|Oscar's virtuosity meets pop hits to create a truly enjoyable \\"light\\" jazz record.  Oscar's playing is really showcased on this disc - often when the trio is joined by a guest instrument (e.g., Stan Getz), it's easy to lose track of Oscar's piano fireworks because the guest is the focus of most of the tunes.  But this is pure Trio...
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app helps to close apps and free RAM. Also shows what sneaky apps are running when you thing they are closed. I have never had any trouble with this app. It does NOT kill services that are needed for the Kindle to run properly. I recommend it as an essential app.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Well done. Nice game play. Easy to use. Just like the Missile Command we played when we were kids ... if you're old.
B005LAII62|5.0|It is always refreshing to see an alternative from Pixar in the world of animation.<br />I mean, Pixar got a lot of fantastic films but, Blue Sky, Dreamwork and so on and on all look the same.<br />One of the few alternatives where the stop motion figures from the weird and wonderful world of Tim Burton.<br />And the someone else did this extraordenary fantastc looking animation based on the book Coraline by Neil Gaiman.<br />I though, WOW how is this possible? Do Tim Burton actually got competition now?<br />And now this beauty! Paranorman seems to be the natural follow up to the weird and kind of spooky beauty from Coraline.<br />It fits oh so nice in the style of the legendary Nightmare Before Christmas starded in the mid 90`s.<br />It`s kind of animation for the people who think Disney becomes too cute and those who are tired of Dreamworks and Blue Sky repeating themself.<br />At the other hand. This is made in a not too edgy and gritty way that would scare away the family only to leave the gothy monstermovie-nerd teenager alone in the sofa. But at the other hand it is scary and edgy enough to be way cool enough for those guys too. And that itself is a pretty impressive achievement. It got a lot of personality and the whole film just look so damn beautiful! The light- effects stands out just like the fog effects stood out in Coraline.<br />But please people. Don`t forget to give much love to Frankenweenie too. That film is also fantastic.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great characters and plot.  The series looks great.  Sounds great.  Has interesting characters that do surprising things yet stay in character.  Recommend it highly.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|I have the kindle 8.9 hd. I had no permission issue so far. I though this might help me be more organized (will see). The app seemed ok and for the FAOTD it's worth a try.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|Why don't we redo Star Trek II and do a patronizingly horrible job? Honestly, this movie is for the millenials, not for the old school fans of Star Trek. I might not watch the new versions of Star Wars because of how badly JJ Abrams mangled the Star Trek story.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I love the book it is fun and adventurous. The book can be sad or happy; or sometimes in between.<br />My only complaint is that the book was a little bit slow at the beginning.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Lots of plot and action, plus a happy ending. What could be better than that?  Christian is every woman's fantasy.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|All I hear from people is how it was a great movie, but to be honest I do not see this movie in the same light as every one els, I will admit it was funny in some parts but I felt they were grasping for ideas when they made it. The producer after the movie even asked the crowd what they thought and they had A LOT of negative feed back. My beef is it dose not fit the bill of any iron man comic when he has the surgery to remove the ark reactor, and it runes the next avengers movie because with out the ark reactor there it's like iron man has lost one of his most unique  characteristics. I as a hard core marvel comic fan was offended seeing  that go to blu-ray and DVD!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I think this is the best weather free app out there. More accurate and current than others I've had. Lots of nice features. Very few glitches.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Those times when you are held up somewhere and wish you had a book?  Now I have several--on my phone!
1609611543|4.0|I recommend this book- it is a great resource and challenges the way we are eating!  Really makes you think about the changes in our foods.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I love this show. It was a great buy. Its got the whole season plus a bunch of bonus features that are super funny. My husband and I don't have cable so we don't get to catch these shows until they're on DVD and we have to spread the show out over a couple of weeks so that we don't spend ridiculous amounts of money on movies and series on DVD. But it was great and it lasted quite awhile because there are like over 20 episodes.

147674355X|5.0|A friend of mine recommended Hopeless by Coleen Hoover. I have seen it before, but the cover didn't appeal to me. I'm glad my friend made me read it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is an AWESOME game.  While they are having issues at the moment with &#34;updates&#34;, it is still a great game.  My grandson got my wife and I into this game and we love it!!!

0316067938|3.0|I'm still a big fan of the Twilight franchise, but this second book is not the best one of the series.
B002JXK5VU|1.0|I really don't like sci fy too much. It really didn't do anything for me. Don't want to continue to watch
0545586178|5.0|The second one is even better than the first one. I loved The hunger Games, but this one was just as good. I totally recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you're into this kind of thing, keep it to yourself.  I feel like women just lost decades of progress. Please EL James, think about what you just did.  Men are dangerous enough. I refuse to put another dollar in your pocket by buying the other books.
1476715904|5.0|I have read many books by Colleen Hover and I have to say that I loved every single one of them. I can't wait for more!
B000LXH0AY|5.0|Excellent musical exploring unconventional relationships, social responsibilities, life and death.  How do you sing & dance about death or AIDS or some other aspect of life?  Watch the movie and find out.  P.S. Bring plenty of tissues with you, just in case.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first, so I wasn't too sure whether I wanted to read the novel. I have to say that the novel is a million times better than the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Well the wait was worth it. They originally said it would be in october till i received it, but it came mid to late august so YAY. I would say a netflix account is a must with this guy, I haven't tried the chrome addin for this beast yet but i'm excited to. Can't wait to see what other applications adopt it, way to go google keep it up!
B0000041WV|5.0|This was a gift for a close friend of mine who is a big fan of Dvorak.  She Loved Revieving it!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|THey work as designed, i'm really enjoying setting these things up. Note the stickers are only writable once, at least that i've found. I used the keychain tag as my trigger for car mode, pretty slick little stickers. Fast shipping too!

B000ICXQF6|4.0|Brad Pitt gives one of the best all time &#34;crazy guy&#34; performances of his career as a paranoid &#34;Eco-Warrior&#34; who is the founder of the 12 Monkeys resistance movement who will be responsible for the &#34;end of the world&#34; through a bio-terror bug.Meanwhile Bruce willis is sent back in time from the decimated future to discover who the leader of the 12 Monkeys is and stop him before he releases the virus that will kill all mankind except for those who flee to the underground.Madeleine Stowe is the psych doctor who must evaluate Willis and discovers he IS telling the truth about the 12 Monkeys and his time travel.The movie is a bit slow in parts and takes a bit to develop some of the plot points and it is a Terry Gilliam movie which explains the bizarreness of the way the story is told but if you can deal with those things then this is definitely an entertaining movie and worth the watch for Brad Pitts performance of nothing else
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this entire series & can't wait to read them all again!  Excited for the next ones to come out!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I can relate to his character.  And no I am not an alcaholic, just have sympathy on those who are.  GREAT flying theory.  Some technical problems with his flying, but overall a great story.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Very poor game instructions.  Hard to maneuver around for non computer game experts. Would like to play but couldn't figure out how.
B00C6F60TC|5.0|I like this movie because it shows the negative effects of demanding perfection.<br /><br />We are heading in that direction with media leading the way by focusing on plastic surgery, hair transplants, laser eye surgery, liposuction and every type of diet concoction and program with all of its side effects.
0756405890|4.0|finally, i have managed to find the time to finish 'the name of the wind'. this was my first literary encounter with patrick rothfuss and i must say, it has its share of greatness. however, when i turn the book and read its back, i get a chuckle. a 'lord of the rings', this is not. sorry mr journalist. a very good page turner? by all means.<br /><br />i dont have trouble remembering characters with seemingly great potential (like Chronicler's mentor, Skarpi) whose role in the book gets suddenly truncated. the thing is, i was continuously tearing through the pages to know more about skarpi, the chandrian or the amyr but the more i was seeing myself closer to finish the book, the more i had to accept the reality that my questions wont be answered, at least not in this book.<br />being already familiar with the concept of sympathetic magic explored by sir JG Frazer in his seminal study 'the golden bough', i and appreciated the nod toward frazer and his considerable opus about magic/sympathy and its religious roots.<br /><br />in the meantime, i actually found myself enjoying rothfuss' actual prose and the meandering by-stories, so much, i stopped giving a damn about the chandrian or any first characters who appeared in the story's beginning. i also quite appreciated young pat's heavy metal clues he peppers his book all throughout. as a metal fan, i found that enjoyable and as the book progressed, i found myself comparing rothfuss to pantera. why?<br />he has amazing storyteller abilities that managed to keep me captivated with a not too interesting story, with lots of loose ends! the same way pantera wrote generally uninteresting music (IMHO) but executed it with amazing musicianship that alone is worth the price of admission. kvothe is an interesting character but, for me he remains a merely updated and better fleshed out harry potter. think of the parallels. both are gifted and attend special universities to hone their magic. except harry potter is more tailored for children and yet, kvothe with his fixation on denna (who isnt too interesting compared to devi, the loan shark, for example!) is every bit a child as harry potter, when it comes to denna. but still. his innocent love story reminds most of us men, how it felt to love for the first time, and such innocence is appreciated, but not when it drags for too many pages. i was also waiting all throughout the book, to learn the name of the wind so it had me cursing in Siaru when kvothe uttered it inexplicably, in a fit of extreme emotion. just like that. as if he always knew it in his subconscious and simply remembered it. another mystery left unanswered.<br />patrick rothfuss has very powerful -and visual- storytelling (did i just repeat myself?) and will no doubt be crafting a story fitting to his writing abilities; i'm almost sure the resulting book would earn rothfuss his rightful place at the high fantasy/magic realism round table where stevenson, gemmell, cook, vance, tolkien and similar legends nurse their pints of ale, crunching lemba cookies and sipping lantrian red.<br /><br />i give this book a 3.5/5 because all throughout, i was under the impression of being given tasty mini burger appetizers, but ultimately denied the promised half pound steak. so now i have bought the 2nd installment 'wise man's fear' and will be hopefully left with less questions than 'the name of the wind'..children and yet, kvothe with his fixation on denna (who isnt too interesting compared to devi, the loan shark, for example!) is every bit a child as harry potter, when it comes to denna. but still. his innocent love story reminds most of us men, how it felt to love for the first time, and such innocence is appreciated, but not when it drags for too many pages. i was also waiting all throughout the book, to learn the name of the wind so it had me cursing in Siaru when kvothe uttered it inexplicably, in a fit of extreme emotion. just like that. as if he always knew it in his subconscious and simply remembered it. another mystery left unanswered.<br />patrick rothfuss has very powerful -and visual- storytelling (did i just repeat myself?) and will no doubt be crafting a story fitting to his writing abilities; i'm almost sure the resulting book would earn rothfuss his rightful place at the high fantasy/magic realism round table where stevenson, gemmell, cook, vance, tolkien and similar legends nurse their pints of ale, crunching lemba cookies and sipping lantrian red.<br /><br />i give this book a 3.5/5 because all throughout, i was under the impression of being given tasty mini burger appetizers, but ultimately denied the promised half pound steak. so now i have bought the 2nd installment 'wise man's fear' and will be hopefully left with less questions than 'the name of the wind'..
B00E208506|4.0|I am not really a Will Ferrell fan but this movie is so cute.  It's light entertainment and makes me smile.<br /><br />It makes you forget how commercial Christmas has become.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|the game is okay its fun an a ditive for awhile. then gets birding I think it is worth while thoghth it is free
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I am certain to read this book more than once.  It gives very good guides and suggestions for conversation.  If you don't learn something new and useful you will certainly appreciate refreshing your insight into communication skills. It's a great opportunity and an excellent bargain.  I'll be looking for other books by Peter W. Murphy
B004P8A7J2|1.0|This is like watching your best friend descend into total despair. Depressing to watch as the characters slowly destructed ( as was apparent this would happen).
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The original charger that came with my Kindle Fire was very loose and unable to charge my device properly. I called Amazon's tech support and after troubleshooting, the technician stated he would send me (free of charge) this adapter and charger. I am very satisfied! It works!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put the book down for one minute. An epic love story! One that was brutally honest. This book really gets you thinking about how lucky we really are. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.<br />I would recommend it to everyone I have ever met!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The spoof is obvious but subtle. Consummate veteran actors inspire the newbies! The only movie I loved more was Red 2
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I tried to use my iPhone to set this up to no avail -- an error states an iPhone app is coming.<br /><br />Looking forward to that day, but DOA for now.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I kept getting a message on my KFHD from FB telling me to upgrade to newer version. I couldn't d/l a version from Amazon for my KFHD so this one was at the top of the list. It works for me
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This was a fun fantasy. The costumes and sets were enjoyable and very tounge in cheek. I really enjoyed it even more the second time.
B003TH14H4|5.0|We have recently been introduced to the Castle shows on TNT.  They are re-runs.  We watched one show and got the dreaded 'to be continued' sign up.. yet didnt have the sequel show.  Luckily, we were able to track down the sequel on Amazon.com and wee able to purchase a view for $1.99.  This is a great show with a great cast.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game. I didn't like the lack of instruction. it took me a minute to figure it out but once I got the hanged of it I became immediately intrigued
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Kids loved it. It was great for all ages. Can't wait to see the next one. How much can I say.

B00009MGGI|5.0|one of the great films and I would certainly recommend it to others who like political drama even thought it is humorous too
B005LAII3A|5.0|At least I thought it was, have both but this one is the better of the two ! The Governator was good, but the cast in this is great!
B00CM9JL4S|5.0|This is a superb folk metal work, OL is a band that works seeking perfection on every song and with all is one they have achieved a high degree of quality, I would rate\\"brother\\" as the most oustanding song of this CD
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Hunting witches ! Wicked ! A new spin on sorcery and magic ! Emma and Jeremy are perfect together as brother and sister ! But you gotta love Edward ! Everybody needs an ogre !
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I thought this game was very well made, and I did enjoy playing it. I think it could have been a bit more exciting, and the ending was a bit of a cliffhanger, but all in all, I think it was really fun. I definitely recommend it.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|The underdog doesn't win on paper, but he's the champ !! Jackman was as good in this as he was in Australia, he's not just The Wolverine !
B003O86FMW|1.0|Recommend this to all who read. Love the way this author writes and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Wanted to read this before the movie comes out and now can't wait to read the last book! Love the suspense!
B00130UFY2|2.0|Watched all the Bourne movies and this one was just as terrible as the rest.<br />Hated these movies all of them.
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|After watching the trailer, my husband, daughters and I all thought it looked like it could be good.  We watched the whole movie waiting for something to develop.  Nothing did.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Surprised I really liked this series. It is actually really good. Can't wait until October so I can see the next Season.
B008X77K8W|5.0|Great story teller. Chris Knight should be on any true country music fan's playlist. Gritty real voice singing songs about everyday people and life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is so much fun!! you have to get this I have a lot of fun do try it its a lot fun it does no freeze for me the only reason it probley freezes for you is because you have a slow ipod or kindel or what ever it freezes because you have to many games on it so delete some games.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I grew up with the original pac-man and I found that this one was a lot harder to maneuver.  I had better control with a joystick.  It looks GREAT though, just like the original game!  If you don't mind trying to swipe fast then I guess this game is for you.  It was not one of my favorites.
B005HSL626|5.0|Downloaded it for grandson during an hour in which he was a bit bored with adult conversation.  He loved the opportunity to play a game on Gramma's kindle! :)
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I liked the first Hungry Shark a lot which is why I got this one to try.  This one is even better!  I would highly recommend this game to everyone.
1623420148|5.0|This was a refreshing & funny read!! In the man's POV, it was perfectly written and I LOL several times. Emma Chase did a wonderful job on this book!! One of my all time favorites! I Had to buy it in paperback!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Awesome game I love it!!!! Very much like Mario bros for Nintendo :) very fun! :) I would recommend this for any age
B00B5P37IG|1.0|can't get the app to work.. its a work in progress...it looks simple, but i am not able to get it to work.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't have time for a lengthy review, so I'll be concise. Great book. Terrific pacing. Compelling characters. Well written. Creative brilliance. Cannot wait to continue the series. I'm glad I'm coming to this series late, so I don't have to wait for the next installment. Well done!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for free!! Can't beat free fun. I would definitely recommend this game to all of my friends. 5 star game
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Installed very easily and works great for showing NETFLIX streaming from an iPad.  No stutters and brings the full power of the NETFLIX profiles on the iPad to a TV.
B002WCLG48|5.0|action from begging to ending..loved every minute of this product..would buy it again in the future....typical halo experance and actio
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This stylus is superior to other stylus' that I have owned.  It feels nice in my hands, not too light, and I like the 3 different tips I can use to negotiate my Kindle fire.  Most other stylus' are too light and smaller--not as pleasant to use--plus, love the pen clip
B009B8YZIK|5.0|way to go master chief... great movie..great action, great actors great film but I still don't understand why I must submit 17 words to rate anything

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Like the title, it was well worth its price (free). No promises on the paid version though, I don't got it because I am too cheap, lol
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is  really funny. I will wait  next  release. Also, my 8 daughter enjoy it. I think this genre can be the game all members in family enjoy together.
B004222UC8|5.0|The best black Sabbath Cd. This Cd is better than anything they did with Ozzy& Dio. You must have this in your collection. Thank you.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Simple and quick read that is very enjoyable. I've been on the path of doing random activities that I love just because and without looking for any money or recognition so I loved the book. Really useful.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|This movie gives you an idea of how Katy Perry believed in herself and stuck to her dreams and goals.  I knew she was different than a lot of other celebrities and I was right.  She is down-to-Earth, generous, sweet, and really cute.  This movie is entertaining and also very informative.  I might watch it again just for the great entertainment.  This movie is appropriate for children and entertaining for ALL AGES.......like I'm 64 yrs. old for crying out loud!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a well written, excellently acted soap opera.  It held me nicely from episode to episode.  And everything seemed to be alright in the end.  But you never know.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Choose bell sounds, set different lengths of meditation, connection with other meditators, and now choose from an assortment of guided audio sessions from Gil Fronsdal, Tara Brach and others. It's the best app around. Highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I'll save it for the meeting, but this would not be a choice I would have picked, suffice it to say.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|For what I am not sure. The past? The future? My own history or that of my ancestors? Mr. Hosseini has the power to make you feel and understand just a little what makes us human.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This one is a page turner. A beautiful story of fate, self sacrifice, war, and love. Highly recommend it. The author weaves a tale of intertwined lives and surprises.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book expands upon the principles provided in &#34;the power of now&#34; and gives more depth and meaning to them.<br />I would recommend reading the power of now first before reading this book.<br />By expanding more on the concepts of ego, pain body, and other ideas, Tolle gives great insight and guidance to the path of awakening.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game, decent length..  enjoyed it very much.  I would like to see more games like this.  there are some out there, but this was definitely a good one.
B00873GRU4|1.0|After finishing a Peter F Hamilton book and with nothing more from Iain M Banks to come (RIP Iain) I saw the hype surrounding this book and gave it a go.<br /><br />So, first a caveat: If have the reading level of a 13 year old girl you will *love* this book. Think 'The Underground Hunger Games' and you're pretty much there. The similarity with Hunger Games isn't just in the writing/plot/one-dimensional characters either - like Hunger Games the Wool plot is a blatant rip-off of a previous work, in this case Stephen Tillys outstanding Amtrak Wars series (The Hunger Games stole the premise of Battle Royale). Perfect for tweens who have zero literary knowledge pre-1999.<br /><br />This is the kind of dross that seems to be infecting the Gen-Z reading list, along with anything by Stephanie Meyer and Suzanne Collins. Some other reviewers have commented that this is destined to be a classic. The Road by Cormac McCarthy is destined to become a classic (which is why it won the Man Booker prize). This series is destined to be consigned to a footnote in history of the time young reader fiction reached an all time low. This kind of stuff was written much better back in the *fifties* by the likes of John Wyndham (The Chrysalids, Day Of The Triffids).<br /><br />Kudos for anyone who makes it through the first third of Wool (man goes outside, two people take a week to walk down and up 100 flights of stairs *yawn*). Unfortunately Amazon won't let me vote zero stars, or give me a refund.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Easy read and the author keeps you intrigued all the way, I have now downloaded The Kite Runner as my follow up read
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Love it.  I especially like being able to put the &#34;notes&#34; in the squares without having to constantly change from numbers to notes.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Books I have read in a very long time. It was like having an open window into the lives of these people, like being the proverbial fly on the wall. If you cry while reading keep the tissue handy!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The product is great. Easy and quick set up. I reccomend for everyone using Goggle services. It is a great value for the price and a cheaper alternative for Google TV boxes.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I loved Good Omens. The brilliance of the perspective - the innovation and creativity is as good here. The interweaving of myth, fact and fantasy is as clever as it is complete.
B00C3MK9ZO|5.0|This is a great album of progressive metal, very experimental, with a very good vocal works, complex rhythms and an exquisite atmosphere that takes us to a journey through sound dark and at the same time beautiful, definitely a great album, An album without fear where live sounds extreme whit others soft and subtle, a curious fact musicians which form the leprous are the same as play live with ihshan currently.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This was a gift for a friend who is an intermediate Dj and he really loves them! Just great gift!
B005CAAXXM|5.0|Bilateral is the second album of leprous a very experimental cd, with a very progressive and complex sound, a great work in the voices a very good album for lovers of progressive metal and for those who enjoy good music without prejudices
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I never know where Connelly will take me.  I always know it's where I don't expect to go.  I made it a point to read the entire LL series.
0817439390|5.0|I have been into photography for a few years now, started after taking some classes in college.  I have learned a great deal from school, experience and trial and error.  That is why I wanted to get this book, try to remove the trial and error part of my photography.  This book has helped and also set my back in some ways, and here's why.<br /><br />The old saying goes (at least I think it's old) &#34;the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know&#34;.<br /><br />Yep, that happened here.  Now a good amount of the lessons in this book I did know, and reading them here really ironed out all the frustrations and questions that I had, so that was great.  It also taught me some new techniques and ideas that I need to work on, so that is good also.  This book will get you more frustrated in some aspects, but that's good, it means you're learning and getting better.<br /><br />The book was easy to read, well laid out and fun.  It was engaging and I always wanted to read on.  I am happy I got it and will continue to use it as a guide to help me improve my photography.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Again, even though I've just started the book I'm already getting to know the characters and their demons.  The list of suspects leaves out no one involved in the web of lies and deceit that goes hand In hand in the police department and drug world.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I was so over Salander by by the second book, I was annoyed that they did not wrap things up at the end of that book - this is a continuation of the story.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Awesome!  Luv this game, I could play on and on. Get it. Relaxing, do not need over the top brain power to play. Luv it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is fun, fun to play.<br />It is pretty rough on the battery though. Just ordered a new battery today.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Just started playing love hidden object games.Will be excellent if can play full game for free.lots of games get so far then you have to pay to upgrade levels
0345803485|2.0|Not a good book.  It is more than one can read.  Just not good. Just not good, just not good.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|it's a nice app, making searching even more easy it changes the whole searching experience, like it so far recommend it for everyone
B00ELIKDXG|5.0|Although you would be forgiven for considering this a children's book I think every adult should revisit the tales of their childhood.<br />This short tale is written in the style of a traditional fairy tale and shares all the magic of the kind of characters and situations you would expect to discover therein.<br />This story moves quickly and easily taking you back into a world of innocent childhood and just as with any traditional tale there is a lesson to be learned for everyone. Here it is that friendship is much more important to happiness than wealth.<br />You will not fail to enjoy this beautifully written but simple story.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is awesome best game on the planet if you dont have you should get i am serious love the game
B000IMKDPC|4.0|My girlfriend and I went to see The Wolverine and she had no idea what was going on, so we started at the beginning with this one. Crazy to think how much time has passed since this came out. It really started the summer superhero blockbuster. I remember liking it a lot more when I first saw it and thought it had a deeper message about equality and justice, etc.  I also don't remember the cast being so small. It's a fun watch. It's like a time capsule.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is possibly the best book I have read in 2013. It's unusual and does not follow the expected format but somehow the stories lure you in, make you think and find yourself feeling as though you know these characters intimately. You think about them while driving in your car and talk about them at dinner parties. Telling you a snippet of the story wouldn't do it justice because it encompasses so many emotions... love, loss, guilt, pain, lonliness, hurt and yet through all of these, you somehow feel positive and wiser for the lessons learnt. A favourite for sure!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I loved it, of course if you read my review on the first one then you know I was disappointed Eric Roberts was not in this movie however Jean-Claude Van Damme was a good runner up to Eric Roberts in the first movie. The other draw was Chuck Norris, I have never seen a movie Chuck did that I did not like cameo or main character.<br /><br />The movie is action packed and fast paced. Well worth watching. I watched them back to back and it was a great movie night in my front room!
1451695195|5.0|One of the best, if not the best afterlife experience that has even been disclosed in a text. Honorable and incredibly well-written. Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeons's Journey into the Afterlife is far superior to just about any other nonfiction book dealing with the existence, topic of a life after death! Distinguished, credible nonfiction book.  Eben Alexander (author) is a high-principled, world-renowned neurosurgeon (i.e. brain, spinal-cord, peripheral nerves, extra-cranial cerebrovascular system). A doctor who performs the most difficult, intelligent, life-altering surgeries within his daily medical practice. Surgery, for the human parts' that control the most vital functions for all of a human beings. Eben shares' his own proven experience that occurred on November 10, 2008! Eben's afterlife, or life after death experience is described within his text, in a sharp, medically knowledgeable, deeply penetrating style. It is PROOF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS INDEPENDENT OF THE HUMAN BRAIN! A human death is just a delusion! There is no death, just a transition of our spirits' from our physical body into an eternity of complete utopia, into a fantastic eternity in Heaven.<br /><br />Amazingly, Eben Alexander was always quick to explain away NDEs, or afterlife experiences that he had always heard of while practicing medicine as a neurosurgeon.  He believed that these type of heavenly trips, could be explained away by how our brains reacted chemically - the neurons - scientific - biological factors. Factors of the NDE surivor was experiencing while dead, or dying.  Eben's many years' as a scientist, surgeon, man of logic - westernized medicine - could not allow himself to even fathom an afterlife. Eben was a complete nonbeliever!  However,  during a meningitis-induced coma caused by an extremely rare e. coli bacteria that flooded his entire brain, Eben Alexander's (author) experienced his own afterlife experience! This occurred while Eben's entire cerebral cortex  was 100% inactivated by the puss, bacteria from the bacteria that had induced his week long death, coma. Eben Alexander describes his afterlife experience, trip beyond our Earth, into Heaven in such a medically sound, astute, THRILLING manner. Eben Alexander (author), states: \\"my synapses - the spaces between the neurons of the brain that support the electrochemical activity that makes the brain function - were not simply compromised during my experience.  They were stopped.\\" It wasn't that his brain was WORKING IMPROPERLY, during his coma.  Eben's entire brain was NOT WORKING AT ALL during his seven day afterlife experience! During, the seven days that Eben Alexander (author) was in a coma, or chemically brain dead, he was guided farther into the the RAREST, DEEPEST REALMS of a super-physical universe, an area very few if any NDE survivors  have ever been too and/or experienced<br /><br />World-class credentials, Eben Alexander has an undergraduate degree in Chemistry from the University of North Carolina, then Eben trained at the Duke Medical School, receiving his M.D. in 1980!  This man had accumulated over three solid decades of medical context, laboratory experience, surgeries, applicable human worldliness inside the human brain, prior to his afterlife experience on November 10, 2008. Well-written, the nonfiction book provides the reader with a wide array of information in regard to human consciousness, near-death, and/or Heaven.  A brief biography of Eben Alexander begins with an explanation of his love of flying; he joined the U N.C. Skydiving Team, (almost joining the Marine Air Corp in Vietnam). Explains that he was an adopted child, the biological child of a young North Carolina mother, father, that he never even spoken a word too. He never knew anything about them!  His knowledgeable background into the human brain is touted, with a resume that includes: internships at Duke University, residencies: at Duke, UK General.  Also, Eben's teaching experience is highlighted! He taught at some of the best Earth's. hospitals - medical schools: Duke, Harvard, University of Virginia, University of Massachusetts.  Incredibly well-written section! It was very insightful writing, since very difficult subject content is easily explained to the reader. Easily-grasped, attainable content for anyone to understand, follow! It explained the entire topic of consciousness! Also, Eben's specific factors inside his trip to Heaven and/or beyond our physical universe.<br /><br />Incredibly, Eben Alexander's \\"entire neocortex - the outer surface of the brain - the part that makes us human - was entirely shut down, inoperative for a full seven days,\\" as he lay in a Lynchburg hospital.  Thus, proving that our spirit here in our physical bodies is not dependent on the brain or the body. We have an eternal soul, that this soul does transition into another realm of the physical universe, Heaven. Given the entire context of this superb nonfiction book, such a conclusion is easily ascertained.  Within the context, information that Eben Alexander was able to experience during those seven days, dead and/or in the afterlife, Heaven.  Awoken from death after seven days, Eben Alexander's entire human brain is flushed of all his past experiences, however he is able to remember his trip into Heaven.  Eben's recovering is miraculous.  A person's chances of surviving such a rare form of bacterial infection, coma then making a full recovery were declared to Eben's relatives (by medical personal) as astronomical; perhaps 1 in a billion.  Eben's brain is able to gain improvement, regain all of his life memories (steadily), all of the wisdom he had held prior to his afterlife experience.  His recovery is short, he retains 100% of his normal functions within his mind, body! Eben then decides under the advisement of his biological son to write down his entire experience before going onto investigate (in-depth) the topic of the afterlife. Eben writes down everything he can remember from his afterlife experience (the butterflies, the woman guide). Also, how Eben's adopted father was not there to greet him, a man he deeply missed, loved and respected. Then Eben's discusses in depth- his experiences with the woman guide, his trip to Heaven, beyond our physical universe.  Formidable research into other near-death experiences, is discussed.  A personal case study is cited. Eben does in fact remember a young three-year-old patient that was completely aware he was going back to his home, despite being apart of a agnostic family who had never even mentioned God, Jesus, or an afterlife.<br /><br />Conclusive, entertaining content. Eben believes that his simple faith was easily more applicable to what he had experienced that anything else, even his years has a neurosurgeon, scientist provided.  Eben states: \\"this was a physical reality that the brain did not create,\\" given his entire brain was shut down by the bacteria infection.  Moreover, Eben goes on to explain how the human \\"brain actually reduces our consciousness that we are able to use here,\\" shown in some cases how \\"the terminal lucidity, we've seen millions of times as doctors, where someone near death who's had dementia for years suddenly becomes very lucid.\\"  Another example of this concept, \\"it explains the idiot savant who suffers a brain injury and suddenly can look at the page of phone book for a second and can remember every name on it.\\" Moreover, Eben remembered that once had a patient that looked at a map for three seconds and drew it perfectly.  Numerous examples like these, do in fact illustrate that \\"our materialist science does not even begin to explain that.\\"  Essentially, that our human consciousness derives from a deeper existence, a soul, and that science and/or technology are beginning to understand this concept.  His experience, vast medical, new-found research within the topic (afterlife), did enable Eben to a stark conclusion.  Eventually, the existence of a human soul, along with a definitive proof of a Heaven - will be proven! 100% conclusively, in the future! However, human science - medicine - technology is in the infancy of providing an absolute substantiation.<br /><br />Undeniable, easy-to-read.  A PROOF OF HEAVEN.  Eben Alexander was an adopted child! He had never met his biological mother, father, Eben had absolutely zero knowledge if his biological parents were even alive, or had more children on the date his afterlife experience; November 10, 2008.  Upon recovery, and/or research into his past family (contacting the relevant North Carolina governmental offices - writing letters to see if his biological parents were even alive), he was told they did now want to meet him.  In 2000, Eben had been rejected in his initial advances to meet with his biological mother, father. Upon meeting his biological mother and father, Eben  was able to learn that his real father was an armed forces aviator (perhaps his infatuation with joining the Marine Air Corps while attending U N.C.)! Also, Eben learned that his biological parents had two other children, that Eben had another biological sister named \\"BETSY.\\".  A woman he had never scene, met or even knew had existed - until they told Eben about Betsy.  Betsy had passed away in a car crash 1998.  Having learned of a sister BETSY, from his biological parents that he was just meeting for the first time his life.  This was numerous months after his afterlife experience on November 10, 2008.  When shown a picture of this woman (biological sister \\"BETSY,\\"), Eben was astounded, completed astonished!  This was the girl on the butterfly wing that had accompanied him in Heaven. Eben remembered her completely! Even after his seven day coma-brain death, he never forgot her image! Holding a picture of his biological sister (BETSY), a woman he had not even known existed on Earth (during his Autumn 2008 - afterlife experience), Eben was absolutely astonished, heartfelt!  This is the woman that had accompanied beyond our physical universe, into Heaven, a woman he did not even had existed on our planet Earth - in any time period - ever!!!<br /><br />Wonderful, fabulous nonfiction book! Learned an incredible amount of medical knowledge, how the human brain works and/or our consciousness.  Very easy to read! Sharp, succinct chapters, very entertaining and insightful.  As a strong reader of nonfiction books about the topic of life after death experiences, or near-death experiences (NDEs), I must say that this is surely one of the best! Perhaps the BEST nonfiction book that I've ever read in regard to the topic of a PROOF OF HEAVEN.  Highly recommended.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I like action packed, fast paced movies with super bad ass characters and that is what this movie has. The icing on the cake is Eric Roberts, NOBODY can play a better bad ass than Eric Roberts and look so good and classy doing it! In my opinion Eric Roberts has been one of the most under rated actors his entire career. Yes he played in some movies that were bad but that is because the script was bad not his acting. When he is given the roles worthy of his talent as an actor he shines, of course that would be Eric as a super bad ass. He is smooth, classy, with a devil may care demeanor in his role as a bad ass which only enhances how bad he really is. Some times people that are not familiar with Eric wonder if he is the good guy or the bad guy however those that are familiar with Eric Robert's work know by the look in his eye, the smile on his face and the grit in his voice that he is going to be a major force to be reckoned with in the movie. I have seen one or two movies where he is a good guy and they are good movies but I prefer him in the bad boy roles.<br /><br />The movie is well worth watching it wasn't rated by most as high as the Expendables 2, which I also rated as a 5 star, however this movie should be rated just as high as the second one in my opinion. I can't wait for 3 to come out.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Nice job of recording these songs.  I wasn't a fan before, but I am now.  No doubt I'll be exploring some of his other recordings.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|This movie had so much hype to it and being a musician I was excited to watch it. I watched the entire thing thinking it has to get better with all the hype maybe its just a slow starter. Nope, it was horrible the entire way through. Now because I am a musician and and was around and legal during the Hair   Metal days I was able to find flaws right from the beginning of the movie. The dates did not coincide with the music in many cases, the songs were much older than the year they were being plugged as popular. Many of the songs were from the late 70's very early 80's and the movie begins as a time age of 1986. Not to mention all those late 70's early 80's songs were no Hair   Metal genre, they were Pop Rock on all mainstream radio. The movie was a parody at best but it lacked humor so if I could give no stars I would have.<br /><br />You want a good idea of that era, with musicians from that era doing the performing or the vocals for the actors then watch &#34;Rock Star&#34; with Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. At least it is based on a true story of a wannabe that got to be and the basis was Judas Priest, Rob Halford and Tim &#34;Ripper&#34; Owens. That is a good movie. That has awesome musicians. That is worth watching.

B006KX3GXO|3.0|Have to say, my opinion is skewed from using Photoshop cs 3 for years. I just waned something to take and edit photos on my kindle, it's fine for that. Very basic photo editing, but fun.
0007466064|4.0|The book shipped right away, arriving in excellent condition.  It's not like any pages were missing or anything, so it's kinda hard to give the delivery anything but a 5-star review.<br /><br />The story itself is typical George RR Martin:  way too many characters, way too much non-sequitor information, and lots of bloody death.  If you like George Martin, then you'll like this book.  I give the story 3-stars for not killing or maiming too many characters in the first 25 pages.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|To really be able to do anything you have to get the laid version. I deleted it it wasn't worth the space it was taking up on my kindle to keep it.
B003OFVIXG|4.0|I bought this CD after hearing one of the songs in the ending credits of a movie (brain fart right now as to its title). Despite the fact that I speak about 3 word of French, the song is clearly emotional. Some of the other songs seem a little more clowny than pop, but overall, I'm a fan.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I downloaded this for my daughter to play. Keeps he  happy and busy while we're out and about...No internet connection required, which was a problem with some of the other games I downloaded. Love  it!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|This truly is amazing. It tracks my activity all day and then at night it tracks my sleep: deep sleep, light sleep, and awake time. Then it will send this to my iPad via Blue tooth.  I highly recommend this product as well as the Withings scale.  A must have for tracking daily weight and fat mass and BMI.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|My grandson has watched this over and over again.  He loves the movie. Will probably order more movies like this one.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is one of those rare finds that you just can't put down. A very easy, entertaining read. My only complaint would be that this book should have been developed into a trilogy! I would have loved for the author to delve into Abby and Travis' lives and relationship a little deeper and for a greater span of time.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|You know when I started this series, it said three books. I enjoyed the first two books. I am so disappointed in this author. It is almost like a betrayal and then she gets a contract for a television series based on the \\"Crossfire Trilogy\\"! How? It was a lie. I was rooting for this couple and now I feel pissed. I know I need to get a life but I am just really disappointed. I am done. I will not be reading another book from this series. I am a fan of Sylvia Day. She has some great books out there. I am just really upset about this.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy this game. In fact I got my husband hooked too. He played on my kindle then put it on his iPhone. So we wouldn't have to share anymore. It is so much fun. It is just what I was looking for.

B000003TA4|5.0|I'll admit it right away, I've never been a huge fan of Nirvana, but something in the last month or so has shifted my perspective, and listening to their MTV Unplugged set has made me a die-hard fan.  I've always had a copy of Nevermind on my computer from the days when I was a bit younger, and I liked them somewhat back then, but that was before I really got seriously into any kind of music.  When I was around 16 or so, I heard a few songs by the popular, yet equally tragic Sublime and was hooked.  I became a devoted fan of theirs, with every bootleg I could find, and I most likely own every song they've ever recorded.  And I'm starting to get the same feeling with this band, Nirvana.<br /><br />Nevermind was definitely their coming out party, as it is raw with emotion, yet clean, studio polished.  It may even be a little too polished, but that gives it a ton of mainstream appeal.  All the songs are great, the lyrics are very powerful, the subject matter is often dark or simply depressing, but it has something most of the pop community does not have, which is brutal honesty.  He was a true rock star, although I'm not sure that's what he wanted in the end.  He didn't want to become mainstream, which is an even bigger reason for respecting him.  His songs are catchy, and he created his own genre, much like my favorite band Sublime.  He was a trailblazer, but like most trailblazers, all his imitators come up short.  There are probably some worth listening to, but right now I am really hooked on his music and his talent.<br /><br />My favorite song on the album is Lithium, followed by Smells Like Teen Spirit, Polly, Breed, Drain You, On a Plain, In Bloom and Something in the Way.  I love Kurt's raw energy, the drums, and bass lines.  I haven't listened to all of In Utero yet, but I find this album superior, and the MTV Unplugged Nirvana's undisputed masterpiece, at least to my unexperienced self, although quite a few of those songs came off this album, so I would say this is a close second.  And Nirvana is slowly becoming my second-favorite band of all-time, and that is saying a lot, as I've been listening to high-quality music for 11 years now.  The song that inspired me to give these guys a second look was Sappy, off which album I don't know, but it was so catchy and made me feel something very deep.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this album, as well as the Unplugged album.  I'll get around to reviewing In Utero once I get all the tracks and feel I can make a sound assessment.  I would definitely say this is bar none their best studio album, and yet another album of a band from the 90s that has stood the test of time.his is a close second.

B004M20YDU|5.0|I really enjoyed the &#34;Reconfigured&#34; version of the songs, some more than others of course, but over all its a cool soundtrack. I usually listen to it when driving or when I'm on my walks! its great background music when working on projects as well :)

0753541637|4.0|I thought she covered all the issues, the pitfalls and her advantages. I thought she was incredibly honest. Young women should read her book.

1781162646|5.0|He's not just a horror writer, although almost everything he does has at least a touch of the supernatural, and this is no exception.  But one thing that King excels at is evident in this read, he develops believable, sympathetic characters and relationships.  This book is reminiscent of a scaled-down version of Hearts in Atlantis, one of my favorite books ever.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was well-written and an easy read. The characters were interesting but the story was very predictable.  You can figure out what the husband's secret is almost as soon as you find out that he has one.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|What an overblown stinker! To be completely honest, I have only seen the 2D version on Pay-per-view. It's probably better in 3D. The visuals are stunning but haven't we become blase about this sort of thing in this day and age? I know I have. I still want a story that I can follow and one that will hold my interest. This movie is L-O-N-G, so long and so dull that I had to watch it over two days because it was putting me to sleep. Morgan Freeman gives us another elder-statesman type part. Didn't I just see him in Olympus has fallen playing the same character? Well, I guess at his age, he needs the money. Tom Cruise is getting OLD! They try unsuccessfully to squeeze tears out of you by using such touches as Procul Harem's \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\" and several shots of Andrew Wyeth's CHRISTINA'S WORLD. I'd rather stare at the Wyeth paiting for an hour or two than sit through  this turkey again.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This show is very intense and keeps me guessing! I am definitely hooked! It doesn't hurt that David Tennant is in it as well.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|What business does a Muslim have editorializing about Jesus Christ?  Is any Muslim capable of objectivity when it comes to a Christian religion or beliefs?  Why would any self-respecting Christian care what he has to say?  What was his motivation to choose Jesus Christ?  The book is meaningless to a Christian.  Let him talk about his own religion, not about a topic his religion detests.
B009JZPH32|4.0|So this movie is kind of dirty but really good. Pretty violent. But still good! Liked the book better though.

B001B1UO6W|5.0|This movie use to scare the shit out of me everything about it is good. Maybe it's a little ridclous but who watches a horror movie for it to be realistic? The acting is good expecially Alex Vincent who plays Andy Barclay the young boy who receives the good guy doll for Christmas. It turns out the good guy doll was really Charles lee ray the lakeshore strangler who transported his soul into the doll. This movie is dark and frightening the hole movie he is trying to take 6 year old Andy's soul. This movie is shocking and will stay with you for along time. It's still effective to this day and even the sequels work for a scare minus seed of chucky avoid that at all costs.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|I read this book about a year ago and loved it. I have had it sitting in the cloud and decided to read it again.  I think DeMille is the best and I have read all his books and listened to some a second time on tapes. John Corey is one of the best characters in fiction and the authors books are so timely and real. I enjoyed and appreciated this book more the second time.  I look forward to DeMilles next books. He never disappoints.
B005MMYPIE|5.0|What a great addition to my collection. I *borrowed* this from the internet for about one day before buying it. I have Nexus on the way as well. While I like the heavier metal that dominates my typical day, this is a nice upbeat change. Kind of like Epica without the orchestra. I also like this female singer's vocals a little bit better. There is none of the off-key whininess found in some of their songs.<br /><br />If you belong to the pseudo-religious high-school cult mentality that only certain bands are \\"true\\" metal, you'll probably hate this band.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|The EVIL DEAD trilogy of director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell spawned a slew of imitations that could never hope to reach the level of occasionally scary and almost contstantly hilarious balance those films achieved, and became one of the least-likely franchises in all of film history. But here, with a new cast of unknowns, and a mostly unknown director in Fede Alvarez, Raimi and Campbell re-teamed to produce a new vision of the classic horror-comedy series, but with a great emphasis on horror and very little on laughs.<br /><br />Gone are the parodic elements of the original, as a group of co-eds head to a \\"cabin in the woods\\" for a reason that already sets the tone for a far more serious horror film as they all come together to help one of their friends through a drug addiction detox. And it's this clever conceit that helps to drive the film forward as she claims to have seen things and have had things happen to her that could conceivably be explained by the DT's, and not by an actual demonic presence. Of course, there are still many moments that were played largely for laughs in the original films that occur here (the infected hand, the Necronomicon being read aloud, the workshed sequence, the speeding camera through the woods, etc.), but with a straight-up horror flavor. Some of those nudge-nudge wink-wink moments are fun, but they get a little old when the film is being played for true horror.<br /><br />The cast of young people is commendable, and Alvarez does enough new with the film to make it fresh, yet keeps the bare minimum of the spirit of the original alive to hook the fans of Raimi's films and keep them interested. I'd have been very disappointed if they tried to ape much of the original's humor without the legendary presence of Campbell, but to be honest, I wasn't really disappointed in this film at all. It's well-made, well-directed, and it's quite effective.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this sub-genre is pretty played out, particularly after the phenomenal artistic success of Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon's brilliant 2012 release THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. But if I were to be honest, this film might succeed more with fans of the genre who really disliked (or just flat-out hated) CABIN because of this film playing the genre straight, and not trying to play with and subvert audience expectations. With this incarnation of EVIL DEAD, you're getting exactly what you think you're getting.phenomenal artistic success of Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon's brilliant 2012 release THE CABIN IN THE WOODS.

B005S9ELY4|3.0|Ruben Fleischer's GANGSTER SQUAD has a number of things that are appealing about it. First, it has some great actors in Sean Penn, who plays the infamous Mickey Cohen here, as well as Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick, Mirelle Enos and Nick Nolte. Second, it's set in post-WWII Los Angeles, which, since the success and greatness of Curtis Hanson's L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, has been rife for storytelling opportunites. Third, it has the classic \\"small group of men take on the entire mob\\" trope that's worked well for decades.<br /><br />But while it has all those things, it ultimately falls too far short of being really good cinema by degenerating into a series of dull cliches, poor characterization and orgiastic, videogame-like violence. The characters are lifted from any number of previous law vs. mob films; Brolin is the stalwart, staunch, straight-laced leader, Gosling is the morally conflicted boozer and lady-killer, Mackie is the switchblade-wielding badass, Ribisi is the nerdy technical guy, Patrick is the grizzled, somewhat-racist old-timer gunslinger, Stone is the husky-voiced femme fatale, and Penn is the bat-poop crazy king of the mob. They're all tropes, which is fine, but if the actors even dared to delve outside the mold of these recycled characterizations, they might have had something special on their hands. But director Fleischer wasn't going to have any of that. This was pure, uncut Hollywood-designed filmmaking ready-made for mass consumption, which is fun enough to watch once, because it does look quite stunning, but if it somehow leaves an impression after you're done watching, you are clearly the audience this film was made for.

I want to be lost in austenland( which is what I would have named the book. as a cool ring to the name) the book show's what Austen life was life, and what boredom it could be too. jane starts out has a woman on the edge of being alone. someone looking for love but never getting it just right.  she is in love Mr. Darcy and wanted it to end, she wanted to move on, so she went to Austenland.  were she does lose herself in austen.. for a while and then it breaks down.. and more fun happens! :) every good first book in the Austenland series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|LOVED IT! You don't have to care for history or politics or time-travel to love this book. It is a story - a beautiful one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great very challenging version of this game. The ads between each game are very annoying. If one could get this game without the ads I would rate it five stars.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is my very first book of this author.. stumbled across him looking through the recommendations of other previous books read.. let me just say.. WOW... i am a true fan now!
0446605409|5.0|The main character in this book, John Corey, makes his first appearance here.  He is different, highly intelligent, uniquely sarcastic, and someone both men and women really are facinated with.<br /><br />Good plot!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|whenever I try to install the app it keeps saying that I don't have enough Internal Storag. I have deleted all my music video books and documents and yet it still does not work. I really know its a great game and I really want it. But I cant get it PLEASE help.
B0031RS8UI|2.0|If you like mills and Boone . Read. If not don't bother. Poorly written and hackneyed story. It was a book I nearly put down without finishing.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Never watched this show when it started, just started watching with Season One on Amazon,  Will be catching up on all past episodes.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is really a fun game, grandkids love it, I would recommend it for all ages though.  Thanks for it.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|Not quite as good as the original, but not many follow ups are.  Still, just love what Anthony does with the character.  Full of gut spilling suspense!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|A refreshing and informative look at what constitutes a genius.  The brief description of Nicola Tesla's work was particularly interesting.  Sean Patrick writes really well and keeps the reader absorbed.
B005PK553C|3.0|I just couldn't get into the show.  After watching a couple of episodes, it just lost my attention and I never felt like going back for any more.
B009AY04A8|3.0|If you like to find hidden objects this is a good game for you. Could have more levels but 16s not bad.
B007BLEKPM|1.0|I rented this movie in HD, and while I have rented other movies in HD from Amazon and they are great. This one was very poor quality, bordering on difficult to watch.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love how you can kill the world, and also choose the symptoms and such. It's also quite challenging. The thing that scared me was when I started laughing maniacally at the world dying.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read this book along with my 12 year old sons, as it was required reading for school for them. I thought it would be fun to read it together and talk about the book. I was greatly touched by the book. The conversations that it brought with my boys were thought provoking and deep. That was especially nice for me since my sons are entering the age where they are removed and quiet at times. Thank you Lois Lowry for writing this book and thank to the teachers for making it required reading.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is the best shark game in the Appstore ever!!! You should buy it! It's so cool and awesome
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the first novel by Jojo Moyes that I have read and I loved it! I will be reading more of her books!
B00CRW2066|5.0|What was rock and roll? In the 60's you could still argue it was something of a fad. When it got really complicated, maybe high brow, there were reactions like Punk. To some extent, there is art and then there is energy, but real rock can produce emotion through intensity or through finesse.I'm only going to look at one song, \\"Pink Rabbits\\", because Rabbits is the most perfectly crafted Rock song I have ever heard.<br />From the first few seconds it is clear this is not going to be an upbeat song about how life is great and all the challenges can be met. This song is going in exactly the opposite direction. This is a song about irreconcilable conflict and how the weak are pummeled by the strong. The over-riding sensation of this song is drumbeats, constant drumbeats, as if the man in the song is being beaten up. Which, any way you slice it, he is.<br />This song is very, very tight. You can barely make out how the layers are put together, and it isn't worth the effort. You can follow the remarkable lyrics, or you can follow the drumbeats. This is, in many ways, a drums song.  Everything else, including a little chorus at the end, is subtle and adds a lot of texture. The whole is more than the sum of the parts.<br />The last time around we got a song called \\"Conversation 16\\". I thought this was a brilliant song, but it seemed to spin out in some of the turns. Again, though, it was about a guy lost in a girl, but this time at the outer edges of pathology. In Rabbits this is a brutally normal situation, a relationship that doesn't end even though it doesn't seem remotely constructive.<br />If you wanted to make this song into a movie, it might be in the 50's style of film noir, a genre where the main character was often doomed by circumstances. In film noir style and texture, imagery, mattered a lot.  In this song we hear about a woman 'sitting in her fainting chair, drinking Pink Rabbits\\" several times. I don't even know what this means, exactly, but it somehow creates an image that I can feel, if not quite see. (This is not quite Barbara Stanwyck in \\"Double Indemnity\\", but there is a level of toxicity, short of the classic Femme Fatale.)<br />In the space of 5 minutes we are given two characters in this song, almost as if it were a movie. Nothing really happens. It is all imagery. (\\"I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park\\") We don't know how it ends. The last line of the main set of lyrics is \\"Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sun kicks out.\\" After that we hear,  in choral mode, two versions of \\"You said it would be painless, it wasn't that at all\\", and then, at the very end, half of the last line  \\"when the sun kicks out\\" on top this repetitive chorus. (Roll credits?)<br />It's just a great 'story'. Things fall apart. It could happen to anyone, I suppose.<br />Maybe this is Rock Noir.<br /><br />Note: This song could be reversed, a guy dumping a woman. I've seen this interpretation, but the reference to 'faintin' chair' suggests a woman, to me. A fainting couch was designed for women in corsets, making the whole thing even more obscure. I'm not sure what a Pink Rabbit is, but it doesn't convey the same imagery as, say, a double Scotch, straight up. There is boxing imagery. The line about \\"the crowd of white girls\\" is a little odd, but many of the lines have an unreal quality, pure imagery. In Conversation 16 the guy was, to me, a psycho, and part of the problem with that song was that you couldn't figure out why anyone was putting up with him. It's curious that both these songs are somewhat 'de-gendered', not trying to create a strong sense of masculine or feminine. Both songs suggest a relationship that has stopped working.
B00A5IYAGM|5.0|Amazing how the old school films had no need for all the gore and over-explicit graphics often used in modern filmography. This film offers a look at a very true and realistic problem that seems to have been haunting societies since old. It makes one see that fine line between true sickness of the mind and and a plain criminal one. This must have been a very controversial film for its time but it brings something that has to be dealt with. Again, is amazing how no over explicit graphics are needed in order to awake one's imagination. Not that I don't like graphics, is just that sometimes the imagination does a better job at imaging and bringing true tension to the scenes. Very well made film and classic for all times. Superb role for Peter Lorre. A better actor for this charachter could have never been found.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|the cast worked from my laptop one day and since has failed to do anything<br />I cannot access netflix at all with my iphone 5 so I can do nothing useful with this thing<br />a total failure<br />no success trying to find solutions
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Good app but freezes constantly and too many porn ads. Make an ad free (or porn ad free) version and update it. If you do that then this will become a 5 star rating.
0062255657|3.0|I wish I had known this started out as a short story--I would never have paid $9.99 for the Kindle edition of a book that took me 2 hours to read. While I did enjoy it, I feel I was ripped off in both $ and story. And although this is being marketed as an adult novel, it felt very YA to me.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Fun documentary for all people who enjoyed rock music of the 70's,80's and more!<br />Enjoyable history of a small studio that turned out some of the great albums and great musicians for decades and created some of the best of rock and roll music!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app.  It works great when i dont want to get up and get my phone. The volume is adjustable and plenty loud.
0812983459|4.0|That said, at some point it feels like &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; on his great walk... Sweet story of human relations and society's expectations and misperceptions.
B001UG4VWQ|1.0|This item is sold in America, but won't play on American DVD players.  Didn't realize this until item came in and the writing was in Swedish!!  My fault for not looking at description more closely.  Amazon  should not have listed it in this &#34;DVD zone&#34; if it wouldn't play.  $30 down the drain...
B002CPMB9O|5.0|Anything where Denzel is in charge or has some &#34;POWER&#34; is awesome to watch. He makes any character REAL. I have read that a lot of the movie was sensationalized for &#34;drama purposes&#34; but the real Frank Lucas must grin like a cat each time the movie is mentioned.  WELL DONE
0688091717|5.0|I love this book for self esteem lessons in my first grade classroom.  I can hardly wait to use this copy.  It was in great condition.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|By far one of the more entertaining puzzle games i have found on amazon or play store. Lots of puzzles. Different types and all challenging although not impossible
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ridiculously addictive, fun game with rich colorful graphics and of  course the hilarity of the minions. Features aspects from both films such as the fluffy unicorn, Gru's freeze Ray and other gadgets. Intense battles against Vector, Meena, and El Macho help boost your despicable score. Loads of fun and a must download game. Gameloft makes great games that don't disappoint.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While there aren't many apps available yet, it's a great device to be able to stream youtube/netflix onto your TV. Having the 3 months of netflix certainly didn't hurt either.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|My blue ray player sounds like it is going to blow up when I put this DVD in it.  I have to put it in the PS3 and it makes noise for about 30 seconds and then it works.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I play this game everyday. Its perfect. I love it. It has no glitches.its perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Like for real
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Very fun and TONS of replay value. I heard Cities and Knights adds some of the things this game lacks; ie combat. But it's a great game that never really gets old.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I'm sorry but this was a stupid movie and a waste of money. I could have shaved and been more entertained making pictures in the shaving cream. LOL
B006ZPAVUS|5.0|Sound is really good!! Definitely a good add on to your vinyl collection (specially if your a Maiden fan )
B009AY04A8|4.0|Decent story line good graphics and objects are nicely hidden but not too easy to find.I enjoyed the game and feel like I got my monies worth.
