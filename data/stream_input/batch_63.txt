B00GQAOL4O|5|I really enjoyed this book. I was able to read about Lea Michele and who she was before Glee. How her Broadway background made her strong. Plus, I plan to use the tips and recipes she included :)
B005QUQ99K|4|Ninjago was HIGH on the priority list for Santa this year.  Loves this toy, but would make it a bit more difficult to deconstruct.  In my personal opinion, Legos should come with super glue for the non moving parts.  It is very frustrating to have to redo each piece when it comes off.  Other than that, my 5 year old really enjoys this toy.
B00H2EQFBK|5|It took me a few episodes to really get into it but the time eras is what caught my attention. As a fellow historian I really enjoy the realistic battle scenes and wizardry of that time. Also it's bloody haha totally recommend this to anyone!
B00H71PBQ8|5|Loved!
0785787135|5|This is the best Arthurian story I have ever read, probably because it acquaints you with the women in Arthur's life and tells the entire story from a woman's point of view.  I have read Mary Stewart's Crystal Cave,  etc. and this beats even those, which heretofore were my very  favorites.<br />If you want to be enchanted read this book.  I will be  surprised if you don't read and reread it many times.  It is a keeper.
B00J2PFPVI|5|Watched it has a family on Mother's day with my adult children.  We all laughed.  Loved the music.  Loved the reindeer and the snow man.  Great entertainment.  Excellent!
B00FATEJYE|5|Best game ever. Always adding new characters and challenges so it never gets stale. Love it. My daughter and I take turns playing. Love it! Excited to see which characters are coming up next.
B007XKEY6Q|2|something about too many tools added and then it quits. needs updates!!! you keep updating the mobile version but ignore the kindle one... get on the ball!!!!
1476770387|1|i have enjoyed most of king's books, both novels and short story collections, but this book is IMO an out and out DUD. i am glad the man has embraced sobriety, i don't want him to die young. but somehow or another, somebody needs to help him with editing or something. his output has gotten poorer and poorer. and this novel is the bottom of the barrel.
B007ZD17XO|5|This game is fun and exciting. It keeps you on your toes. I recommend this game for anyone who os looking to fill time with a game.
B00DR0PDNE|5|i really love this tiny wonderfull its great
1587613379|5|I don't know ask my recipient. I sent it to her.
B00MILGKPI|5|Was filled with action, laughter, drama and a little mystery.  Was excellent.
B0089EHWQE|5|This was a different book for me and although it is emotional I really enjoyed it.  Couldn't wait to be able to sit and read.  Love these kinds of reads!
B0035JNTA6|5|A classic that never gets old! I could watch this time and time again and still laugh at every joke.
B000002OOY|5|Very pleased with product and seller.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I watched all three seasons in less than 3 weeks. I was able to watch the first two seasons on Netflix, but had to buy the third one.
B00002MZ2T|4|I thought that the song Crash and Burn had alot of meaning and strength in it.  It really lifts one up when they are down.  It made me feel enlightened when I first heard it.  I was going through a real tough time in my life and this song really helped me get through it.  Whenever I need to relax I play this cd.  It makes me feel good on the inside. I really recommend this CD to anyone who needs their spirit lifted.  All the songs are great and they all hold some deeper meaning.
B008FPZQQU|5|This was one of my demo LP's back when I sold High End audio in NY back in the early 70's. I have since switched over to CD's due to all my moving around I had over 2000 LP's and they just got to be too much to move all the time. Besides my old copy was scratched and had a lot of surface noise and pops. I didn't get back into LP's because of the cost to do so. Anyways this Deluxe 2 disc set, 1 disc remixed from the master tape has 3 audio formats superbly Re-mixed by Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree, the other a digital remix that contains the original release. there is no comparison to the master tape remix. I like the enhanced stereo version best, my self. Tank which is missing ( One of my favorite cuts ) because the original master tape was either damaged or missing is a loss but it's now one of my own demo CD's. Its kind of interesting to hear the 2 versions of &#34;Take a Pebble&#34;, another one of my favorites. Its so much quieter with out all the LP surface noise that you can pick up so much more detail than ever before that its scary. Vinyl lovers will hate my statement on that, but really give it a listen, absolutely superb. This is THE best audio version I can ever remember hearing of this fantastic recording, Super Highly Recommended!
B00B8M4IMK|5|This charger handles all my iPxx charging needs with aplomb.  Simultaneously charges my iPhone 5 and iPad air.  Great product, great ergonomics, and great performance!  Thank you!
B005LLSZNM|5|Awesome show.  Was not able to view &#34;The Kiss.&#34;
B00GSQJJ34|5|By far my favorite version of this type of game
B000066C6Z|5|If you love spoofs of classics, this is another to add to your collection! A young Val Kilmer as an Elvis type spy!!  Not quite as funny as Airplane! or Naked Gun, but well worth the price!
B009JZSC9S|5|Very interesting, almost addictive.
B00E5Q1HJS|4|Good movie
B00CRVZRUS|5|Love the Beatles. Seen this movie in the theater when it came out. After all these years, still love the music and the humor.
B00E8KLWB4|3|This game is ok. But if you don't want to spend any money it takes a long time to accomplish anything.
B00I0TFR9C|5|One of his best vocal performances ever and the musicianship is stellar.  The rest of the musicians are first rate, particularly on keyboards.  The production and arrangements are first rate as well.  All in all it's an excellent album and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.
B00821PCJS|4|Really enjoy the show.
1607066017|4|I am not a seasoned comic reader or a seasoned reader in general nor am I a very good review writer, so you can take this with as big of a grain of salt as you may like.  I'll start with this...  This series contains a lot of vulgarity and some graphic moments that you may not like or want other people to see in public (even I hit some of those pages unaware in the middle of a Thai Restaurant, turned red and gingerly tightened my hold on the book). The background is left mostly up to mystery or interpretation at this point, and things happen fast and hard and can seem aimless.  HOWEVER,  There is a lot of character development in the works for this series. There is more than one side to this story and there are more than one set of characters that have reasonable goals who you will want to succeed. People that start out as blank villains, become living breathing creatures with good intentions behind their morally questionable actions and you find yourself rooting for the bad guys but still hoping that the good guys come out on top, but who really are the bad or good guys is all perspective.  The narration in this series is great. I'm not sure how else to say it without giving things away. Just trust me, great narration.  Personally, I like melodramatic romance, so the main couple scrappily fighting in whatever way they can to keep their family together even though they are even deeply scarred by their past and don't have a clear direction of where to go in the future just speaks to me. From this aspect it's very real, in life, there is no person there moving the storyline saying go to here and then here, talk to this person and he can fix it all (this isn't Dora the Explorer). Don't get me wrong, the story moves along, but there are moments where people don't know what to do and you don't know what they need to do either.  Rock and a hard place scenario, big time.  At this point I've only read vol 1. and like I said, I'm not a graphic novel expert nor am I educatedin what makes a great graphic novel, but I personally like this novel and you may too based on the reasons I do.
B00I8H6MGS|5|Great acting.  A must see.
B000000OQY|4|This was a good 2nd album, but definately not an Appetite.  Included is the slow acoustic You're Crazy, which I like better.  Less than 34 minutes.  I've been told that the first 4-songs are fake-live.
B00HZ0SC4E|5|McConaughey and Let give a flawless performance depicting the realities of a tragic disease and the fight to stay alive.
B00FKF0F3C|3|I finished the trilogy and each was a page turner. I thought the last was too long, maybe because I've lived it since 1944 and seen the changes
B000002UB3|5|English sentences ..Japanese.. therefore permit me though it might be unskilled.  <br /> <br /> <br />This work is the last album of BEATLES and medley in the latter half.  <br /> <br />I think that it is only a very good tune, and the highest masterpiece  <br />of Beatles.  <br />
B008XG1X18|1|Pinterest doesn't interest me.
B008IJTFYW|5|It helped me when I was to stressed to sleep. Its lets you set a timer and has a few times set up for you already. It has a lot to it.
B003G4W49C|5|I think this was a great book. I thought that they were not really open about every thing that really happen to him in space school. If they would have done that it would have been great. It was also confusing when he first see Valentin . I thought it would have been easier for him . He looks all strong and now won't show eney affection to her. So that is what I though was a little weird to me to put him in that place with the only one he really still loves in his family. That's what I though was really mean . So I will keep reading still a very good book.
B0014DFCMS|4|I love this movie so much I want to take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant.
B004FGMDOQ|5|I was looking desperately for something to read after all of Harry Potter and the hunger games books.  I found it here.
B00C81MW6O|2|I love this album so so much, but it skips! It is unfortunate because the talking heads are one of my favorites.
B00CSR2J9I|5|I have it on both the kindle and I-pad. I have both because the wife has one or the other.
B00E5C3AJM|5|I had the first Star Girl, and I absolutely loved it! Then I found this and WOW! All new designs, and Italia Moda! It's even more glam than before!
B000002KHH|5|Paronid made its debut back in 1970 the best part about this album is the music and the band. Iron Man just kicks ass I have to say im not a big Black Sabbath fan but I do love there first 5 albums. War Pigs, and Paronid dont have the intensity as Iron Man but there still great songs. The rest of the songs just go with the album. If your a rock n roller then buy this without second thought. This is a classic that should be added in your collection for great rock n roll memories. 5 STARS it is Black Sabbath Paranoid enjoy.
B0017VV816|5|My husband has been dying to get me to watch this movie. He loves all the sports movies. I finally watched this (for research for a book I was writing) and was blown away by the storyline and depth of the characters. Really really great movie! Highly recommend for any women who want to please their husbands.
B00BD99JMW|5|I need one of my friends to finish this book so we can discuss it!  I'm heartbroken but happy. I don't think this series could have ended any other way. Keep the stories coming Veronica Roth!
B00B935SUY|5|The whole family watched it beginning to end with great interest.<br /><br />Maybe the one fault I'd find in it is that it seems to go abruptly from how great the Studio A space was to this great mixing board.<br /><br />All the different bands that made great works of art there along with the studio's satff nicely tied everything together though.
B000VWYNNW|3|I've got to agree with the &#34;Garden Tapes&#34; guy. This could have been the definitive version of this album, but the bad edits ruin it. What sounds good in the movie (and the &#34;excerpt reel&#34; or whatever it's called on the bonus disc that comes with the DVD) does not sound good on a CD/MP3/etc. Buy this if you're a Zep die-hard, but keep your original soundtrack too. Do you really want an incomplete &#34;Black Dog&#34;? An off-time edit in the segue from &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; to &#34;Whole Lotta Love&#34;? Jimmy took a questionable soundtrack and made it worse. There's much better live Zep out there-even on bootlegs.
B00821OX98|4|Entertaining.
0596805888|5|I've enjoyed paging through this book and reading a bit at a time.  I keep it in the kitchen and browse through it while waiting.  The recipes are quite good too, and it's gotten me interested in sous vide cooking.    The only thing I find corny is the description of the 'hacker' mentality.  I write software for a living and I always cringe when I read descriptions of how a \\"cool hacker\\" is supposed to think.  The rest of the book is much better than these few introductory pages.
B004SIIBGU|5|I love being able to find items that you can no longer buy
B00008LDPU|5|This animation creation will be in everyones DVD library for years to come. This indeed adds insight to the whole matix story. The art work is nothing short of that...ART. Amazing every step of the way. i was lucky enough to have viewed all 9 episiodes. I cant stop anticipating the matrix reloaded after being privilaged to viewing this DVD.
B00FN5Z8UY|5|this was exactly what I was expecting. I was very pleased with the selection and availability if the product and I would be pleased to recommend your company to others in the future. this is my. third purchase and plan on making more in the future. Thank you
B005COO1X6|2|pace, but a bit thin. Haven't you written this story before?? Buick 8, Christine, Trucks? Great use of syntax, though.
B005CRY2O6|5|Just took a chance and made the surprise tartin for the first time for a Christmas  Eve buffet. It got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Looking forward to trying some of the other recipes. Wonderful cookbook for vegetarians!
B0095XPZBC|5|Well worth it. A great TV show that you just don't see anymore. A scifi show that tackles real world problems in an entertaining way while presenting an ideal humanity. The HD restoration is beautiful and not jarring unless you had previously watched the series on DVD for comparison. Highly looking forward to the rest of the series and hoping for a DS9 HD-ification, fingers crossed.
B001F12J48|1|Thought it was a 3d movie and it was but it comes with the red and green glasses. This one is not made for a 3d tv. The movie is great but I ordered the wrong dvd
B0012QE4Q2|3|If you've read the novel this movie is based upon ('The Other Boleyn Girl,' by Phillipa Gregory), you'll probably be a bit disappointed in the movie.  Natalie Portman does give a good performance as Anne Boleyn, but Scarlett Johansson is less than stellar as Anne's sister, Mary.  The script focuses too heavily on Anne and her relationship with Henry VIII, ignoring the other characters that made the book so interesting: the Duke of Norfolk, Anne and Mary's brother George and the role he played in Anne's downfall are largely ignored.<br /><br />Those of you who are familiar with Henry VIII are likely to be left scratching their heads over the choice of Eric Bana in the role of Henry.  While I'm sure Mr. Bana is a fine actor, he bears no physical resemblance to Henry at all.  Furthermore, the script writers left his quite one dimensional.  In their efforts to showcase the hold Anne Boleyn had over Henry, he's left appearing like a dog on a leash, rather than besotted.<br /><br />Great time periods are compressed as if events that, in reality, occurred over years and years appear to have happened in just days.  This leaves the film with a disjointed feeling.<br /><br />The role of Henry Percy, Anne's first husband, provides unintentional comic relief.  While he appears in several scenes (and is quite important in Anne Boleyn's life story), the poor character has no lines whatsoever and the actor is left resorting to over-dramatic facial expressions. Very funny to watch.<br /><br />The one bright star in the production is the performance of Ana Torrent as Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife.  Not only are her physical attributes perfect for the role, but her performance is utterly believable and left me wishing her role had been larger.<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with the original novel or Anne Boleyn's story, you may very well enjoy this film.  Do not, however, believe this film is in any way historically accurate.  If you loved the novel and are a history buff, you might want to skip this one altogether and go rent a copy of \\"The Lion in Winter\\" for a great retelling of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine....much more accurate and a good history lesson, too.gether and go rent a copy of \\"The Lion in Winter\\" for a great retelling of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine....much more accurate and a good history lesson, too.

B00081U7HC|5|Bought this movie, which I love, on DVD to replace the VHS version that I already had ! ! !
B003JTHXOK|2|It was an easy read and engaging.  but it seems that every Nick Sparks book has the same basic format even though it promised a unique conclusion.  Good escapism though.
B00DUGCLY4|5|Game is a lot of fun. Have you thinking a lot. This is a good game. It get harder as the levels go higher.
B00CL68NOG|4|I enjoyed this movie more for Seth Rogan than Barbara. There was a real conflict, more than one and the writing drew me in so that I cared about things. I cared about whether he would sell him product, I cared about whether she would meet her first love, I cared about whether they would resolve the tension between them. Barbara played it subtly so her acting didn't over shadow the plot. It was an enjoyable movie.
B00JCW0BCY|4|Interesting perspective, but repetitious. Could be a much shorter book and remain effective.
B000FVQLRA|5|Una película llena de muchas emociones.
B000AJIF4E|5|A quality product is so many ways, e.g., comfortable fit, excellent sound, great value and well made.  Two minor issues:  1. the male plug on the headphones doesn't fit in my iPhone 5 without removing the cover.  2. The head cradle could be improved to keep the width that I set.  I have to tweek it almost every time I put the headphones on.  The notches for the number settings needs to be more firm and better quality.  This us what happens when engineers have to cost reduce their design.  Overall, I love these headphones.
B009GEBBNQ|5|it was Good. a be see dee e ef gee ach i jay kay el em en o pee qu are es tee you vee doubleu ex why zee
B00HV2KPNW|3|The movie kept freezin, pausing up the girls were getting real frustrated. I do love the movie though!!<br />Great thing about sister love!!
B00AHSIQWE|4|Yay!  Christian Bale as batman!  I think he does an awesome job!  Considering all of the violence in this movie, I still think it was well done.
B00GJ7CSHG|4|Not one of Rodgers best, I feel..................
B00CJKW4WQ|4|This is a great idea.<br /><br />My laptops have always had an integrated number pad, but when I purchased my first Mac a few months ago it did not have the number pad. (Yikes! How did I not notice?) This Satechi keypad does the trick when I'm working numbers on my computer AND it can also be used as a stand-alone calculator, too.
B00594XOZU|1|never use it
B00CBRAD2A|3|Classic Arnold. Limited dialogue, one liner humor, bad guys die horribly; all included.  Fun flick though if you include some popcorn and have limited expectations of depth and substance.
0679890475|3|This story was a favorite of my children when they were young. We read it often. I was recently asked to read to a group of preschoolers but had long given away our  copy of Are You My Mother. I purchased this edition without noticing it is a &#34;simpler and sturdier&#34; book &#34;for Babies of All Ages&#34; (as it says on the book). Sadly, that means it's actually an abridged version which measures only 4&#34; x 5 1/2&#34;, not large enough to read to 20 preschoolers. I would suggest to anyone to get the original charming classic version of the story as this one does not do it justice.
B000BGH22W|5|The Goblet of Fire was always my favorite book.  I knew that there would be real technical challenges with the movie, but they were successfully overcome.  The Goblet of Fire is a delightful movie.  I loved everything about it, including the music.  The classical pieces are just gorgeous, and the rock and roll pieces were so much fun.  I loved the Quidditch World Cup early in the movie.  Very well done.  Out of all three challenges, all of which were well done and very exciting, the Black Lake challenge was my favorite.  Years ago I purchased the entire series of books for my grandson.  I was hooked with Book One, and I immediately ordered each and every new book, as well as the DVD's as soon as they were available.  I know so many adults that loved the books and the DVD's every bit as much as the children.  For so many of us, J. K. Rowling is a heroine, who taught children to love to read, and enchanted them with the movies.
B00004XONN|5|Kid A was the first time I had ever heard anything by Radiohead, and I must say I find it amazing. I had heard that Radiohead was a kind of alt/prog rock band, so I went into Kid A expecting some radio-worthy, borderline pop tracks. I couldn't have been more wrong. What I got was a twisted realm of nightmares that you can't wake up from and a wasteland of the mind. There is some seriously dark ambient music on this album. Parts of it have been compared to The Aphex Twin, and I think that's a fair comparison. This album still gives me chills, especially Everything In Its Right Place and the title track. The National Anthem is one of the best tracks on the album, going from dissonant horns and saxophones to a sheer wall of noise. Talk about exhilirating. Fans of The Aphex Twin and harsh/dark ambient will surely find a small place of solace in Kid A, a place to call home. And unlike The Aphex Twin, who mixes in the occasional light, almost happy piece such as Analogue Bubblebath I, Kid A is relentless in its pessimism. The feeling even stretches into the bizzare (but incredibly awesome) artwork that coems with the album. I haven't listened to any other Radiohead music, but I think this album is great. My only gripe was the track most people seem to like, Optimistic. I didn't think it fit in very well, though it's not a bad song, so to speak. All in all, if you want to hear something completely different from almost anything you've ever heard, and you have an open mind, go for it. Otherwise, maybe settle for something a little more mainstream.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|I love this game but got past level 150 on my Kindle and it says I have to wait for more boards but I just got past level 150 on my phone and it went to 151!  How do I get more boards on my kindle?
B00DR0PDNE|5|We use this every single day in our house. It makes life and streaming so much easier, especially when you're watching Netflix or Youtube because your computer isn't blocked due to what's playing (like it would be when connected via HDMI). It also came with a 3 month Netflix code, so that was an added bonus!
B00CSR2J9I|4|Get the game it is awesome and is cool when u get to the stage moon.
B006PHD0RW|3|I played the lire version and loved it so I bought the fill but now whenever j try to download it there is an Error and it ways to try again. I have tried everything and nothing works also when I then exit app store. it looks like I never bought it so I have to huh it again. I dunno if it charges me again but if it does that is some serious shenanigans because I have bought it now at least twenty<br />times
0783241569|3|&quot;Okay, here's the pitch, J.D.-we get Julia Roberts, right? And she just kinda plays herself, right? And Hugh Grant is the male lead, and...&quot; That's probably all the producer needed to hear before he okayed this project, thinking to himself (&quot;We'll worry about a script later...&quot;). I usually shrink back in revulsion when I see trailers for Julia Roberts films, but I must admit that if you just turn off the &quot;logic&quot; circuits in your brain, you'll find &quot;Notting Hill&quot; a pleasant enough 2-hour diversion. The actors portraying Grant's screen family are amusing, particularly during the obligatory &quot;meet my colorful and wacky relatives&quot; dinner scene. Roberts and Grant give thier standard issue one-note performances, hitting thier marks and flashing movie star smiles big enough to cover the gaping plot holes. Okay for a &quot;popcorn movie&quot; mood.
B00J8CGU64|4|Really well done....if you can get past the extremely vulgar language, extensive drug use and graphic sexuality.  But in the context of the story, all are entirely appropriate for showing the depravity of the characters.
0767819543|5|5 stars is not enough to classified this great film! With a great direction, by Walter Salles, great cinematography, wonderful original score, divine screenplay and the best role played by Fernanda Montenegro,  the biggest actress in Brazil, this film was simply made with heart to  those who have hearts!  For me, THE BEST FILM OF 90's!!! There's no other  that has the quality and the Beauty of this! I'm proud of being brazilian,  watching this film! It shows my country like it realy is, with lots of  problem, but with people touched by heart! Thank you Walter for a  marvellous work! And Fernanda Montenegro, the Oscar doesn't deserve your  magnitude! You're the best in 1998 for sure!
B00005JNS0|5|disney / pixar makes great movies and this is one of them! great family movie with a great storyline. loved it
B00881VLCE|2|Puzzle makes your arm hurt because you have to press so hard down on the puzzles.  Fun when it works, but it keeps stopping. I will probably delete it because it keeps stopping.  But the concept is good.
B00E8KLWB4|3|I enjoy the variety of different games in one app. I can't stand it when you have to buy this, or buy that all the time. I enjoy it while I have enough power, and then I wait until my power is restored. I'm not buying anything for a game.
1400082773|3|I was excited about Obama becoming president so I got this book.  It was okay.
B000QRIGJY|5|Love this character.  Love being able to follow Harry from one murder to the next! This book is hard to put down.
B002ZG9968|4|This is a cute romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez about a woman who is fed up with waiting. She decides to take fate into her own hands and have a child with or without a man. The interesting twist is when the guy does show up. Cute movie is  you are in the mood for something like this and gives a little inspiration to never give up on love, let it find you.
B000MRAAJW|1|I have a Toshiba HD-DVD player and it would only play the opening sequence in a continuous loop without a menu. I could not begin play or look at a menu. I was sent a second copy and the same thing happened. I have no idea what the problem could be since I have had no problems with any HD-DVD in the past. I have heard of one other person with this problem.
B00DNB9RXO|5|This is an amazing game.  It's a platform game, you move the cat across a beautiful and mysterious world.<br /><br />You have three options--button control, accelerometer and drag control.  You use one of these options to tilt and rotate the screen world which causes the cat to move through the world picking up jewels and avoiding pitfalls.<br /><br />I recommend the accelerometer.  I couldn't get &#34;drag control&#34; to really work, and the button mode made things move too fast and abruptly.<br /><br />You have three jewels to pick up on each level.  There's no penalty for moving slowly in the regular game, but there is a time trial.  You do have to be alert to the pitfalls, which can be hard to pick out.  You don't seem to have any penalty for losing lives, but I'm not sure...<br /><br />You pick up seeds along the level that allow you to create &#34;continue&#34; portals.  These will allow you to restart the game from that point.<br /><br />There is a little round floating eye that is the spirt of the tree.  You can touch the eye to go back to the main menu; it will also apparently alert you to the presence of important or dangerous objects.<br /><br />I recommend reading the &#34;How to Play&#34; on the main menu.<br /><br />Once you have collected all three diamonds in that level, you can play it in Time Trial mode.<br /><br />Some of the pitfalls are obvious spikey things.  But sometimes, the cat is swallowed up, and this isn't a pitfall, it's access to another set of passages.<br /><br />I really found this game mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful.
B00FEMJF6O|5|This is a awesome game.
B0052RDHTM|5|Excellent
1400064287|3|I enjoyed the book, but felt like the authors' core ideas had been covered or predictable by the time I got to page 120 or so.  No doubt, there are compelling things in here.  However, I felt that the Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible Emotional Stories theme is something that could have been handled well in the context of a 25- to 30-page article.<br /><br />For my money, a better option is Cliff Atkinson's [[ASIN:0735623872 Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft® Office PowerPoint® 2007 to Create Presentations That Inform, Motivate, and Inspire]].  Yes, I know what you're thinking...a book about PowerPoint is your preferred option?  No.  It's a book about storytelling.
B002L6I9Z4|5|My six year old nephew absolutely loved this camera.  He is very into all the Lego toys and this was a perfect little starter camera for him...he was able to start taking pictures with ease once it charged.  He also likes he can &#34;add&#34; some legos to the top of the camera!  Excellent buy!

B000002IJL|4|Love the movie, love all the songs (certainly better then anything today), but why include only 10 nostalgic songs? The whole disc is only about 30 min. long. And some of the best songs from the movie are missing. Why couldn't they include:<br /><br />The Impalas - Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home)<br />Bobby Day - Rockin' Robin<br />The Monotones - Book of Love<br />The Fleetwoods - Come Softly To Me<br />The Mystics - Hushabye<br /><br />So this is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars.

B00B5AAW52|5|I had all the seasons separately on DVD and after years of watching them.. some of them had worn out. So i asked this for Christmas so that i could watch it again. I don't know why some of the reviews say cardboard sleeves because mine came in boxes. Boxes very similar to my individual DVDs. It plays great and so far i have no complaints and i'm almost through season 2. I have not tried it on my dvd player like some reviews say because i play my dvd's on my computer while doing homework and stuff. Overall i am happy with the product. I also want to point out that there seem to be two different versions available on amazon. I got the one that was released last year so i think the packaging was upgraded at that point.
B00HV8U540|1|rubbish....... does not do the book justice.
B004UJAOLM|3|I wanted to like this book. I love classic historical fiction/historical romance, and I was hoping to find the same thing in this novel that I had found in Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre (written by Emily Bronte's sister, and way better). I really don't get why so many people rate this as one of their favorites. For me, there needs to be at least one character that I care about. These characters are all unlikeable. That's not to say the book isn't worth reading. it was interesting, and well written, but it could have been so much better.
B000001E18|5|Whereas Achtung Baby! now sounds a tad dated, Zooropa sounds fresher every listen.The albums are quite similar in style however, both nodding towards dance music, though Achtung Baby was really only a token effort.Zooropa  succesfully mixes dance beats with a kind of avant-garde cyberpunk sound,  most noticeabley on Lemon, a stand out track - a laid back falsetto driven  &quot;dream landscape&quot;.The traditional U2 style of classic rock  survives on other tracks, such as &quot;the first time&quot; and &quot;Stay  (Far away so Close!)&quot;. The latter lays claim to being U2's greatest  track, a swirling lyric accompanied by a simple yet beautiful souding  guitar piece. The album's theme is taken from the ZooTV tour and centres on  the sensory overload of modern televisual culture. The first three songs  carry this theme mainly, the title track mixing in corporate slogans with a  classic Bono lyric about &quot;dreaming out loud&quot;. Babyface is a more  conventionall sounding track about the merits of porn videos (!). The third  track (Numb) sees Edge attempting to sing again( or in this case  robotically chant a list of rhyming words). Van Diemens land is far  superior. A sharp repetitive guiter riff dominates the song, which does  irritate after a couple of listens. Jonny Cash makes an appearance on the  last track (The Wanderer) which is a real grower and a classic in it's own  right. Backing vocals from the edge and bono compliment Cash's deep  baritone. In the context of U2's career this ranks as my personal  favourite, lacking the pomposity of the late 80's albums, and not trying  too hard like Achtung Baby! It is a very chilled out album and shows U2  capable of a greater range than they are given credit.  They are much more  than a stadium rock band - songs such as &quot;Daddy'Gonna pay for your  crashed car&quot; really pushing back musical boundaries. This track is  dominated by the rhythm section, which does to an extent overshadow the  impressive lyrics tackling drug addiction.   With out doubt in my mind,  U2's best album to date. Creative and inspiring.

B001OQCV60|4|When I heard that Robert Downey Jr was going to play Sherlock Holmes, I had my doubts. Robert Downey Jr is an immensely talented actor, but could he play such a well established character as Sherlock Holmes ? If you're looking for a movie novelization of Conan Doyle's books, watch the Jeremy Brett episodes instead.     Guy Ritchie has definitely updated this version of Holmes to be a more modern man of action, but he still adheres to the original characterization. Holmes is described as being a talented boxer and fencer as well as having great strength. So, it's no surprize to see him engaging in fisticuffs. He's also described as being rude, insolent and at times morose. Whether or not he'd work hand in hand with Irene Adler is another issue. There are many parts of of this movie that seem very true to the books and others which are a modern update. I'd say that Guy Ritchie definitely took some poetic license with this movie. But, this does not detract from the story. This is a very entertaining movie.     Oddly enough, Robert Downey Jr was a surprizingly good (cerebral) choice to play Holmes. It certainly required out of box thinking to cast him. No, he doesn't look like the drawings from the Strand. He shouldn't. Once again, you can't compare him to any other portrayal of Holmes. This is a modern way to look at Holmes. In this version, he uses his brawn as much as his brain. As a personal note, find out who Robert Downey Jr's personal trainer is because RDJ is in amazing physical condition. While you can argue that Sherlock Holmes might not have fought in a pit, he would have felt uneasy in a social situation. In one scene where he's dinning with Watson and his fiancee, Mary, you see how uncomfortable he is in public places. You see how outside noises seem to disturb his neural processes. He can't block out the noise, he can't think clearly and it puts him on edge. RDJ is wonderful at displaying Holmes' brilliant mind and occasionally off putting eccentricities.Speaking of those eccentricities, the moments with the violin were a nice touch.     Now, also of considerable note was Jude Law. His Watson was absolutely spot on. He was wonderful. Nigel Bruce, God bless him, was nothing like the books. In fact, Jude Law's Watson is much closer to the book and that was a pleasant surprize. Watson was never supposed to be a bumbling old fool. Watson was supposed to be a competent retired military doctor. So, it makes sense that Holmes would have someone like Jude Law's Watson by his side. And Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law have absolutely fabulous chemistry. You have to pay attention because their witty repartee is very rapid fire and very funny. When you see them arguing, it really does look like you're watching an old married couple. There is a off hand reference to them being brothers, not of blood, but of the soul. That's very true in this case. Holmes and Watson are portrayed as squabbling siblings. Can't live with each other and can't live with out.     Rachel McAdams does make a fetching Irene Adler, but her character does seem out of place in this story. I feel she was put in so that the film didn't seem like an old boys type of film. It is a very male dominated film and the Irene Adler character is supposed to add a bit of femininity. Here's my problem with her character. She's described as a master criminal in the movie. That was never the Irene Adler in the books. Yes, she bested Holmes and yes, she masqueraded in male costume and maybe Holmes was in love with her. But, in the movie, she's portrayed as a female Sherlock Holmes and that didn't sit right with me. Once again, this is a modern update of the Holmes story. The villain, Lord Blackwood, is portrayed by Mark Strong and he is very good. He has a very mellifluous voice that he uses to his advantage as Blackwood. I can't say if the black leather jacket was period to the 1880s, but it did lend a sense of malevolence to his character.     I will say that I appreciatedthat the art director showed London as it was in the 1890s i.e. dirty, grimy and crime infested. People should remember that the London atmosphere that produced Holmes, also produced Jack the Ripper. Of course, in some ways, you could compare Lord Blackwood to Jack the Ripper, but it isn't so neat. This is where the story does get a bit confusing and convoluted. Part of the story involves black magic and a secret society that may or may not be the Masons. The story doesn't always make sense and that's where the action compensates. I do think that Guy Ritchie did go a bit overboard with the action. He should have concentrated more on the story. In short, what the story lacked in coherency, it made up with great actions scenes and witty repartee between Holmes and Watson.     I enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed this film in spite of the weakness in the story. It's a surprizingly good take on the Holmes mythos.
0061928356|5|Very touching and well-written. I loved it.
B000068QY7|4|For all of their occasionally stupid behavior and a couple of really weak albums, it's nice to have someone like the Gallagher brothers in a world full of personality and swagger-free bands. I can't say I'm -that- much of an Oasis fan, but this album is pretty damn good from start to finish except for the pointless instrumental bit near the end. The opener &quot;Hindu Times&quot; is excellent, although the main riff does sound a bit like U2's &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;... but then again it's nice to see Oasis borrowing from some other band than the Beatles (hehe, only joking). For all it's cliche-ridden lyrics, &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; is an undeniable heart-tugging show-stopper, &quot;Better Man&quot; is a great dirty little number, and the rest of the songs are almost as strong and catchy. So, nothing particularly new, but then Oasis never pretended to reinvent the wheel and this album is full of great, solid rock music.
B008JFUS0U|4|The actors seemed to meld for a great performance. The storyline was good but the whole movie seemed darker then necessary.
B008JFUO4U|1|Got the long-awaited pre-order.  Then BR would not play past the opending Universal logo.  Black screen!  Called Amazon, got a replacement and having same problem.  Looked around for forums online and found lots of chatter about the problem on a couple of players.  Seems to apply to the first issue of Oblivion BR products by Universal.  Maybe someone in Amazon should train on tech problems.  Or at least include a warning for pre-180GB PS-3.

B00AP9RQE4|3|It was fun to take a jaunt through someone other than Miles' stories, but unfortunately this story doesn't have quite as much depth as Ms. Bujold's other stories, and it almost didn't fit in given the differences in old characters.  For example, why is Ivan's mother suddenly &#34;Mamere&#34; all the time when previously he usually referred to her as &#34;M'mother&#34; (yes, I know, means same thing but that's the point of voices and continuity) or just &#34;Mother.&#34;  The love story was also fairly predictable, with certain characters being awfully clingy awfully quick, but perhaps that was the problem with not having a whole book like, Komarr, say, to develop the female's background.  It was nice to see another side of Simon too, but again, his character was just somewhat incongruous with previous renderings.  This story is supposed to allow him to develop more but there needed to be more development and not just sudden shifting.  Lastly, the sudden appearance of another planet at the end of the book was sort of the final straw.  Many other worlds had already been brought up in previous stories that would have been fun to leave a dangling introduction to at the end but why a whole new one?  The goal of the book seemed to be to turn everyone's (well, almost everyone, Lady Alys is as cool and collected as ever) characters upside-down, and not just individual characters but characterizations of particular groups as well.  It just didn't quite work to do that to EVERYONE all at once.  Worth a read, but, unlike some of the other Vorkosigan-universe books, I don't think I'll be revisiting this one anytime soon.
B004H4XDBI|5|I read 'If I Stay' and thought it was a good read. It caught my attention and kept it throughout the book.

I honestly think I enjoyed this book more than I did the first one. it is such a great read!!!

B000002J1O|5|Just kidding, I like Van Halen too. But seriously in 1973 Steve Hackett did some amazing guitar work only this album. One of the first recordings I heard a guitar player 'finger tapping' ala Van Halen. From the first time I heard this back in the '70s, I fell in love with Selling England by the Pound. It's beautifully dynamic - one of those albums you can listen over and over again; you can put in a CD player and select repeat and listen to it all day.
B004W2UBYW|5|This is a very good book. Steve Jobs was a very unusal man.The book gave a very good discription of his intense ,creative, and excentric life style.

B0029O0BLS|5|This is the first review I've written, because I prefer to keep my opinions to myself in general. However, this film (and specifically the BluRay transfer) is excellent. I've always been a fan of the story, but I forgot how well executed the movie was until I saw it again on BluRay. Excellent video transfer and great sound mixdown really highlight how well-made it is. This is one of a handful of disks I use to show off my home theater setup; and for less than 10 bucks, there's really no reason not to have it in your collection.

B007L96SI6|5|As a huge fan of Haley Reinhart since the earliest days of her Season 10 American Idol run, Flask Man has eagerly, hungrily and obsessively anticipated the seductive siren's debut album since her elimination from the show during Top 3 week last May.<br /><br />At times, it seemed as if album day would never come.<br /><br />Beginning with her October move to LA, Haley almost immediately began logging countless hours in the studio, feverishly writing and recording album tracks with some of the music industry's top producers and songwriters. This intensive, 3 month creative period would result in her recording an album that by any measure should be considered an incredible debut effort.<br /><br />It also showed us something we didn't know: Haley is a damn good song writer. She technically may only be 21 years old, but the girl has been infused with music since birth by her parents, who have had their own rock band since before Haley was born. Her knowledge, appreciation and understanding of music history runs deep, and she certainly showed she has the ability to draw from it in the stories she crafts in her lyrics, musical arrangements, and the catchy, sometimes hypnotic melodies of her songs.<br /><br />In interviews, Haley's struggled to define the sound of her album, but usually has settled on saying she was going \\"retro with a modern twist\\". On Listen Up! she was very successful at striking this tricky balance, as the album does have a throwback sound, but is definitely not old-fashioned.<br /><br />Haley's incredible versatility as an artist is also on display, as she successfully infused Motown, disco, rock, reggae, pop, soul, hip-hop, R&B, funk and even some hints of her famed jazz vocal stylings. Of course, no element on the album is more prevalent than Haley's sultry, sexy vocal tones that turn up the heat on virtually every song.<br /><br />When discussing the album, Haley's said she really wanted to make it raw and organic, but, if I have one criticism of Listen Up! it would be that production got a bit heavy-handed at times. I did appreciate some of the production effects, just not the lazy or gratuitous ones. Would have liked Haley's voice left alone more, and adding electronic drum beats and synth strings to certain arrangements only served to detract from her authenticity and allure. My suspicion is the producers decided it would make the album sound more current, but I disagree with this thinking. Haley arranged a great blend of old and new without needing such artificial imposition.<br /><br />That said, from this music lover's perspective \\"Listen Up\\" is a joyous feast for the ears, and will send you on a fantastic ride that can at times blow your mind. How refreshing to have a full 14 track album without any useless filler (you have GOT to buy the deluxe version). I enjoyed listening to Listen Up from beginning to end without ever reaching for the skip track button. VERY well done, Haley! You are truly gifted.<br /><br />Anyway, without further ado, here is my song-by-song review.<br /><br />Oh My! - Expected to soon be released as the 2nd single off the album, \\"Oh My!\\" harkens back to Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" in the sense that Haley spends much of the song having powerful orgasms. The Motown arrangement is contrasted with deep blaring horns, heavy production, and a ridiculous rap interlude by B.o.B that's obviously a sellout to Top 40 radio. While this tune is certainly catchy and fun, it's also a bit of a noisy mess for me.<br /><br />Free - The first single off the album, Free is about mercifully ending a sour relationship as nicely as possible, and showcases Haley's bluesy, sultry, jazzy tones with minimal production. I particularly love the crashing symbols as she hits her opening verse, and the hard driving drum beat accompanying her vampy stylings. Definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />Liar - A rock/soul vibe with a good back beat and cool phrasing, Haley seems to be willing to tell herself anything she needs to in order to stay with Mr. Wrong.<br /><br />Wasted Tears - A catchy Motown track about recovering from heartbreak, this song hearkens back to early Supremes with lots of horns. Think \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\". A fun song that makes you wanna get up and dance.<br /><br />Undone - A piano ballad straight from the Adele school of heartache. While Haley delivers a rich, heartfelt vocal, the synth strings are sappy and the song gets too whiny and repetitive for my tastes. Not my cup of tea, but if you like melodramatic pop ballads you'll love Undone.<br /><br />Now That You're Here - A retro, 70's disco groove with a soulful vibe, this track gets you up and dancing from start to finish. The light, sexy, breezy flow makes it a song everyone will want to sing and clap along with. I'd say it's the catchiest song on the album, because I can't stop singing it. A love song that makes you want a partner to boogie with.<br /><br />Wonderland - A true retro, Motown throwback, one wonders who she's singing about being her man for the past year and a half? (cough...Stefano...cough) I like it, it's got a nice beat and is a sweet love song, but it gets a bit repetitive with the \\"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Wonderland\\" chorus.<br /><br />Keep Coming Back - A funky tune about an ex-lover who keeps working his way back again. Shows off Haley's more forceful vocals, and she tosses in a hint of growl for good measure, too! Good change of pace song, but would have liked it better less synthesized. Some cool guitar licks from Haley's father Harry.<br /><br />Hit The Ground Running - Damn, Haley can write some sexy lyrics. This one's about Haley seducing a guy and then dumping his ass when he falls too deep for her. A killer torch song aching for vamp Haley to get the guys hot and bothered with a blues-rock edge instead of the sunny Motown beat. Still sexy and sultry, but catch her live performances of this one. They're so hot.<br /><br />Walking On Heaven - Another classic 70's disco track, on this one Haley's seeing the world through happy, rose colored lenses and is ready to sing and dance about it. I'm only too happy to sing and dance along with her! Synth heavy, but since it's a disco track it seems appropriate.<br /><br />Follow Me - An interesting track. Heavy synthesized distortions are over-the-top, but the reggae is pretty awesome. Not sure how I feel about this one yet.<br /><br />Spiderweb - This haunting, psycho-sexual rock thriller is absolutely mind blowing. I found myself addicted from the first listen, and consider it the most powerful song on the album. Vocally, Haley's at her seductive, femme fatale best. Love the tender, lullaby piano opening as Spiderweb gradually builds to full on rock before ending with the lullaby piano again. Think \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" meets \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". If this song doesn't turn you on you must be dead.<br /><br />What You Don't Know - A sweet song about new love emerging from friendship, this classic 70's disco track pulls you onto the strobe-light dance floor rocking the polyester leisure suit. Dust off the disco ball, and shake your groove thing, baby!<br /><br />Let's Run Away - Haley shows off her Reggae chops, and guess what: She's absolutely awesome!! I love the way her tone meshes with the reggae beat, and the track's fun, loving vibe is infectious. Who knew? Get me a margarita on the beach and let me dance to Haley.<br /><br />Final rating: Haley Reinhart's \\"LISTEN UP!\\" (Deluxe) = 5/5 Starserself anything she needs to in order to stay with Mr. Wrong.<br /><br />Wasted Tears - A catchy Motown track about recovering from heartbreak, this song hearkens back to early Supremes with lots of horns. Think \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\". A fun song that makes you wanna get up and dance.<br /><br />Undone - A piano ballad straight from the Adele school of heartache.

If this song doesn't turn you on you must be dead.<br /><br />What You Don't Know - A sweet song about new love emerging from friendship, this classic 70's disco track pulls you onto the strobe-light dance floor rocking the polyester leisure suit. Dust off the disco ball, and shake your groove thing, baby!<br /><br />Let's Run Away - Haley shows off her Reggae chops, and guess what: She's absolutely awesome!! I love the way her tone meshes with the reggae beat, and the track's fun, loving vibe is infectious. Who knew? Get me a margarita on the beach and let me dance to Haley.<br /><br />Final rating: Haley Reinhart's \\"LISTEN UP!\\" (Deluxe) = 5/5 Stars
B00FN811SY|5|Excellent app.
B0025KVLRO|5|This is the British release of the first Beatles album.  I've bought lots of \\"remastered\\" stuff that didn't sound any different from the original, but this is not one of those.  The sound here is clean and downright startling, like you're sitting in the studio within reach of the drum kit.  The liner notes say \\"these songs are presented on this CD in mono.\\"  I don't know what that means exactly, but in any case different stuff is coming out of each speaker, and it sounds effing fantastic.  No, with 6 covers, this isn't the most inventive Beatles album by any stretch, but as a historical document it's essential.  This is March 1963 !! At the time, the liner notes say, teen-oriented music was by and large singles, with LP albums mostly the province of \\"...easy listening instrumentals and musicals of stage and screen.\\"   But when the needle drops here, McCartney shouts \\"One, two, three, FOUR\\" and the band careens into \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" sounding almost punk-like in attitude.  Not hard to imagine 5 million horrified British parents covering their ears.  But it's too late Mom, the cat's out of the bag... and racing across the globe.

B008GWSS6W|5|Always been my favorite John Wayne movie. I have a very bad DVD copy and an iTunes copy this was better.
1591396190|2|I find this strategy model to be a far too simplistic of the real business world and, thus, vastly over-rated in terms of its value. It deals with the \\"old\\" analog business world and pays little regard to the major changes sweeping corporations with the digital revolution. <br />. <br />In my opinion, of far greater value is a book called \\"BIZNETS: The Webopoly Future of Business\\" by Frank Feather, and I suggest you check that out and compare before buying this one. It covers 6 case studies to find the common threads of successful strategy in the \\"new\\" and future digital business world. <br />. <br />By contrast, Blue Ocean is somewhat tired. Sure, I highly regard the successes of some of the chosen companies. But the way they are presented is so 1980s. I rate it 2 stars. <br />.
B00D7JGL36|5|Been waiting for this one!  I'm a huge Merle fan and I think Vince does an awesome job with Merle's songs.  There's more steel guitar in them which is great because Franklin is the best!  If you're an original country music fan, you will want this one!
B001XRLWPQ|5|I've been a fan of Nathan Fillion for many years from Buffy, Firefly and Serenity, so I had to check out Castle. I first saw it on network TV, and am very happy to be able to review favorite episodes on DVD. My only regret is that it wasn't released on Blu-ray. Nathan plays Rick Castle, a playboy writer who gets involved with the police when a copycat killer's targets mimic some of the murders in his books. I'll let you read the general synopsis for more details so I don't give too much away. One of the best parts of this show is the great relationship between Rick and his daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn). Finally, a portrayal of a normal, happy, intelligent teenager on a TV program! There are many other interesting characters, including a couple guest roles by Buffy alumni. Nathan is witty, campy and dashing as ever in this well-written show. If you're following him on Twitter, you know that there are some Firefly/Serenity references in this show, along with Nathan's trademark \\"Feed the Birds\\", (FTB), and \\"Bam, said the lady\\".

B00MNCWMM2|1|JM has been my #1 music hero for 25+ years. No more. Sorry but I need to be entertained by music and this stuff is dreary, repetitive, boring, unoriginal  and the lyrics are average at best. No doubt John is portraying his personal experiences and  insights through the music. But if that's how sad it is, I don't wanna know. Honestly the band must have fallen asleep recording this, I know I would. Best of luck John but you forgot all about entertaining. I've traveled the world from Australia to see you play ... Mellenfest in 98, the 2001 tour in Indianapolis, in London for a promo around 2010. That was when you were interesting.

B008476HBM|5|Every time I read this book it's as good as or better than the last. Classics are called so for a reason. Read and enjoy this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This is a beautiful innocent true love story.  Even though there are life changing illnesses in the book, it shows that love is truly blind when hearts make that connection.  Get ready to shed some tears but the underlying story makes it all better.  Highly recommended.
B009RH973I|5|I just love my case! Holding it while reading is easy, since it has nicely contoured edges.  It just snaps on, no elastic at the corners to holdi t in place. Also, there's a hole in the spine so your charger can be plugged in  while the cover is closed.
0800179501|5|In 2004 this movie will be 20 years old.  Certainly, some of its cultural references have aged a bit, but the soul of this movie and its core themes hold up just fine.  My younger kids, who are karate students, enjoy this movie a great deal.  Ralph Macchio gives Danny a nice combination of fear, resentment, vulnerability, and charm that make him live as a good kid trying to make it in a new school and a new life in a strange place.<br />This movie rises most on the portrayal of Mr. Miyagi by Pat Morita.  A very fine actor in a very fine role.  He brings some complexity and pathos to the character.  He makes his befriending of Danny believable.  His mourning for his lost wife and child who died in an internment camp while he was off winning a Medal of Honor defending the country that imprisoned and neglected his family is powerfully moving.<br />Elisabeth Shue, who has gone on to some wonderful things, is also pretty good here as the girl from the right side of the tracks who is attracted to Danny because she sees a lot of good in him while her peers only see the poor skinny kid.  Randee Heller is very good as Danny's Mom who means well but is a somewhat clueless (maybe willfully so) about why Danny doesn't want to be in this new place and why push starting the car as she chaperone's Danny and Ali on a date in front of her rich snooty parents might cause Danny real pain.  I mean what could she do about it except just push ahead like everything is just fine?<br />This is a movie adults can enjoy.  However, parents would enjoy it even more watching it with their children.  I think young adolescents are a perfect audience or this movie's lessons.  They haven't become too cool, yet and will find the story resonates with the trials they are facing in their young lives.
B0000640VO|4|Okay, so yes this movie is completely unrealistic and does not have tons of depth to some of the peripheral characters, and many of the situations are strange and bizarre, but its hillarious.  I think the best way to describe this movie is quriky--each characters have thier own quirks and strange obsessions (very Roald Dahl-like to me). <br /> <br />No, this movie does not encourage you to think deeply about the psycology of the characters or their situations, but that makes it a perfect, sit-back and enjoy it FUN movie that will have you grinning through the whole thing. <br /> <br />Yes, parts are strange and at first its hard to see how some parts fit in, but each of the situations/subplots are humorous and are wonderful. <br /> <br />Do not watch this movie expecting it to be some sort of earth-shattering deep Academy-Award winner, because then you will be so confused at first that you will certainly be dissappointed.  However, this movie is one of the greatest feel-good movies ever, and despite its strangeness at points, it just fits so well with the quirky, but wonderful characters.

B0080SZ0V8|3|at first this game was pretty cool puzzles were fun yet challenging. now well its just a repetitive pile of crap. nothing like doing the same puzzle over and over and over again. I'm a mother of 5 boy do I know a repeat when I see it. this is about the same thought process of my 3 yr old daughter. fun......but then again the fun gets dumb.

B000UBMWG4|5|o, one of the benefits (I guess that you can call it a benefit) of having a broken ankle is that you get to watch a ton of the movies off your Netflix queue that you wouldn't normally have the time to watch and, in my case, to do it in a relatively sober state because I can neither drink or take the \\"good\\" pain medications.<br /><br />Blade Runner is a 1982 science fiction/dystopian future type of film starring Harrison Ford and directed by Ridley Scott. Ford plays a semi-retired Blade Runner in LA in 2019. Blade Runners are police officers whose sole job is to chase down and \\"retire\\" (a synonym for kill) replicants. Replicants are humanoids that are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, created by the Tyrell Corporation, but which have been banned from Earth due a violent uprising that occurred in the years before the events in this film. They are now limited to off world colonies, doing dangerous work that humans can't or won't do. At the beginning of Blade Runner, we learn that a group of 4, cunning replicants have returned to Earth and are going on a rampage.  Ford's character - Rick Deckard - is a retired Blade Runner who is called back into service to help track down and retire these out of control replicants. During his quest, Ford comes across Rachel, a replicant that is employed by Tyrell company as the CEO's personal assistant, that is somewhat of an anomaly - she's called \\"an experiment\\" - because, unlike the other replicants that Tyrell has produced, Rachel actually has memories, albeit ones that come from Tyrell's niece. As the movie progresses, Ford develops feelings for Rachel that he struggles with periodically during his quest.<br /><br />I had never seen this movie before, ever, even though we have the DVD at my home and my husband absolutely adores the movie.  It apparently also has a cult following - now not so much a cult following as a mainstream following.  And I can see why - it's a pretty good movie. What shocked me is that people agreed that when this film was released in the theaters in the early 80's, it was a complete and utter flop. People hated it.  No clue why because Scott created a really good movie with Harrison Ford as his lead man. Thematically, the movie was attractive because it dealt with themes of memory and identity and how they are intertwined: are they intertwined, how much does one impact the other if at all, etc. I really enjoyed how the scenes were shot and the sets themselves. The darkness, with some brief interludes of light, fit in very well together and added to the overall feel.reed that when this film was released in the theaters in the early 80's, it was a complete and utter flop.

B009NQKPUW|4|Sci-fi people will be happy with this thriller. If you're pregnant, or recently have been do not watch it. Just like with Alien. My wife could not handle a couple of scenes. Extended ending was better the standard. Enjoy!
B00B2JSRAS|4|Nothing new about the concept the author is trying to drive. The same what Napoleon Hill taught way back in 1937 is used in the same book.<br />There are numerous books out there unlike what the author claims. For eg - Think big kick ass also talks about believing and thinking big and never doubting it for a moment.<br />Any of the big timers who say dream big, because you dream - you do., - all drove in the same point the author mentions.<br />What is dreaming big? -  nothing but to wish for the big, think about the big, train for the big.<br />Nevertheless, I rate it four star, cos it will help me! No two doubts about it - whether its a copy or an original concept does not matter to me. What matters is did this book help me. Yes it will.
B009UX2YAC|4|This game is brilliant! It is a challenge, but gets much easier as the game goes on, and you learn to play it better. The only down side is this: once you get to times 30, you can  level up anymore. And, say if you accidentally delete this game and download it again, it forgets all your data and you have to start from the start. Sad face :(
B000UD0ESA|5|Have a friend who wanted this because he likes making home movies and is interested in making movies for his family

Confusion and mayhem ensue when Elwood's sister Veta takes measures to not have her brother and Harvey embarrass her family again. I highly recommend this movie version of the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Mary Chase.

0898453992|4|The short story, &quot;Breakfast At Tiffany's&quot; by Truman Capote, is certainlty a compelling publication. It is enthralling, and gives one a true aspect of life in everyday society. Capote's novel teaches one about life, and the myths it holds. He sets the stage up for Holly Golightly to &quot;fail&quot; over and over again, which is what life really is about - bouncing back to realitization.<br />  Throughout the novel, the main charecter Holly Golighty goes on a whirlwind of adventures. She is always conforming to society, going in and out of crowds as she pleases, until she finds a part of her hidden self. Capote creates real human feelings and emotions in this book that many people are able to relate with, which makes it so compelling. This novel certainly is one to treasure, along with the other writings that go with it. The book displays the realities of life, and the harshness that exists in the world.<br />  Nothing is perfect, no matter how hard one tries. This is what Truman Capote is trying to point out to the reader. The novel's honest truth is why it is so loved, and the connection that many people have in common with Holly is very apprieciative too. Without this writing, the world would be missing something that can touch the lives of so many. *

B008M0NDOK|4|The Duo Controller is a nice sized controller that is easily synced to an iPad.  You just turn on the controller, then with a few screen clicks on the iPad, the controller is ready to go.  It has two thumb sticks, a directional pad, four buttons and two triggers which seems like more than enough for most apps.  I found that it seemed a little light and wished it had some feedback, but my daughter liked it just fine.  The response was very good and had no lag, although I did lower the sensitivity in the game because it felt too fast.  I could not use the stand because the iPad already had a cover on it and it wouldn't fit into the slot.<br /><br />To test it there was only one game available for free and one for $0.99.  The other three games though were $6.99.  The game we played was \\"Brother in Arms 2: Global Front\\", which is a fun FPS game.  With auto-aiming set on, it was easy to go through the first few levels and kept mine an my kids interest.  There was a good mix of controller and touch screen.  The only problem was even though the controller was synced through blue tooth, it doesn't automatically use it in the game.  You still have to go to the settings in the game to change it to the controller and it was not very intuitive to set it right.  And you have to wait for the game to load before you know, so it took a couple of minutes to set.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Easy to hook up and sync to an iPad<br />- Controls are responsive with no lag (I did have to lower the sensitivity on the game because it felt too fast)<br />- Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front Free<br />- fun game, I'm not good at FPS games, but with the auto aiming it was easier and I could get through some levels, back story was average<br />- good mix of controller, plus you can still use touch screen (to throw grenades and heal life)<br />- My daughter was better than me (maybe this is really a con)<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 1 game was available for free (so only one game was reviewed)<br />- 1 game was available for $0.99, and 3 others were $6.99 (I would have also grabbed the 99 cent game, but the iPad was not connected to my account, only Anna's so I didn't get it)<br />- I felt the controller was a little too light, but Natalya thought it was just right (she has an Xbox, so has something to compare with)<br />- The stand does not fit an iPad that has a cover on it.

6302968135|5|powerful and violent, this is a extrodinary and moving drama about three friends who takes paths of their own and then end up against one another. Benjamin Bratt and Damian Chapa are fantastic, Bratt is way better in Pinero though. Ving Rhames and Billy Bob Thornton also star in this grand look at the life in L.A. and the Chicano heritage.

B00003OSU4|5|A great Film, my only dissapointment was the ommision of theDuke Ellington set, closing the actual event. This is an art film, thecinemaphotography is outstanding. The use of shape and light is masterful. Musical Highlights that ARE included in my opinion, are Anita O'Day, Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, and Monk.<br />If you are a (open minded!) jazz fan, and a art genre fan this is the film you have been waiting for!<br />DVD Info: Excellent color and sharpness. Audio is in Dolby Digital Mono. Crisp clear tone. Extras include a complete playlist for all three days of the festival. An interview with Bert Stern (both text and audio) with accompanying documentary imagery relating to Mr. Stern's other works mentioned in interview. Much insightful discussion about the planning, filming and post production of the film. Very fascinating and well worth the price. <br />Now, it may be me, but it seems that i noticed some brief segments of footage in the DVD release that i never noticed on my VHS copy. But im not running the VHS again to check, this DVD is so much better!
B00EMJBVAI|5|Really enjoyed this movie. Acting was good, story was fresh, I would watch it again.

1582701709|1|I wonder if anyone who believes this book has ever heard the proverb/cliche, \\"If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.\\"  In the same way, \\"If wishes were scientific fact, every gullible idiot would become the center of the known universe.\\"    It bears repeating: this book is bad, but the people who have made it a phenomenon are below contempt.  Honestly, I'm beginning to suspect that there is a target market labeled: \\"will believe any comfortable lie.\\"    And comfortable lie this is.  Consider some of the claims made in this book, and their antidotes:    SECRET REALITY: Beethoven created great music because he believed in the \\"law of attraction.\\"  REALITY: Beethoven created great music because he was a genius and worked hard, and in fact was lucky to have been given a rigorous musical education by being the scion of a relatively wealthy family.    SECRET REALITY: Shakespeare became the most famous playwright of all time because he imagined being the most famous playwright of all time.  REALITY: Well, or maybe it's because he was a genius, and he worked hard.  And also, again, that he was lucky.    Really, the only thing stated in this book is the \\"power of positive thinking,\\" which is then used to reinforce the most disgusting materialistic pretensions.  Usually I can handle the \\"positive thinking\\" crowd, when they believe that they are helping people get well, or improving their spirituality, or improving the quality of their relationships.  The thing is, this book is obviously marketed towards wealth-seekers.  The sort of wealth-seekers who pay 50 dollars for a \\"work at home - make unlimited income\\" packet.  Basically, wealth-seekers who know they'll probably never be wealthy, but can't stand to base their lives on anything more real than this remote or nonexistent possibility.    I was disgusted to read that some grade school teachers had used this to teach their classes.  The story really indicates the whole irony of this book.  Kids as low as kindergarten aregiven magazines and told to \\"cut out anything they would like to have.\\"  So the kids cut out, obviously, whatever is in the advertisements: cars, expensive clothes, liquor and cigarettes for all i know, and this is added to pictures the kids bring in: bicycles, gaming systems, horses and other animals, etc.  All of these images are collaged onto something sometimes called \\"wish boards\\" or \\"attraction boards\\" or \\"visualization boards,\\" and kids are told to believe that they will have it all.  If this doesn't explain why our kids ain't learnin', then I don't know what will.  Maybe in 20 years or so, we can expect EVERYONE to be an idiotic narcissist.    Perhaps the most disgusting thing about this book is the materialism.  Honestly, if everyone who wanted to be rich was rich, the economy would collapse in an instant.  It's incontrovertible.  The fact is that everyone can't be rich, and that furthermore the rich are generally to be pitied for their vast spiritual poverty.  Look, I grew up with rich people, and decided that the last thing I ever wanted to do was be rich.  So for those of you who haven't had to gaze into the blighted and unhealthy souls of people who are motivated only by money, let me just give you yet another saying, a cliche formerly known by everyone that has been erased by American marketing propaganda: there's more to life than money.    If this is a self-help book, then I'm an animated movie star.
B00BAQZFHG|5|Always one of my favorite movies. Catchy songs, great singers. The disc is first rate but it falls down on the special features.

B00005JP7Y|5|I expected good things from this movie, and i was completely blown away! Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are spectacular dancers! Channing Tatum is also a feast for the eyes, but we knew that after She's the Man. The movie had a great plot and a beautiful love story. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did and I highly suggest going to see it!
B000001FTD|5|Among the Living is one of the best thrash metal CDs around. Great riffs combined with good musicianship and strong vocals from Joey Belladonna put it above a lot of other bands. Anthrax added more melody compared to their early work like Fistful of Metal and Belladonna is a major upgrade as a singer. Lyrically they went all over from American Indians to comic book characters, but also added some humor into the mix. The bass line from Caught in a Mosh and the guitar riff from Indians are enough for you to buy this CD and the rest is icing on the cake.

0345803507|5|I am not a reader at all, this book was a game-changer though. I read the trilogy in two weeks. It's impossoble to put these books down.

B000UVV2DS|1|It was not a Herb Alpert recording..  I threw it out.
B00008S2VG|5|A lot of people don't like this album, and I can see why: it's gritty, edgy, weird - both lyrically and instrumentally, and breaks out of the upbeat pop mold that other Madonna albums fit in too.  Frankly, this is why I, and most people who appreciate art, LOVE this album!  It's not a pop album.  It's more rock and experimental and techno, and there's nothing wrong with that.

After reading the other reviews I've come to the conclusion that I'm either getting old or missing something about this CD. Several of the songs seem to have very simple melodies that  are totally overshadowed by 7 minutes of continuous double bass drum. I  thought my head was going to explode at one point. On a positive note, the  mellower songs were very pleasing to me. I think if you took away one bass  pedal from the drummer, this band could put out alot better CD.
B001NLKWLW|5|Without a doubt this book was one I did not want to put down. The author skillfully weaves an air of suspense that keeps you guessing along with extremely descriptive writing that allows you to imagine the costume and scenery of all time periods in the book. The story tells of a granddaughter attempting to solve the mystery of her lineage. It jumps between three time periods but manages to flow smoothly. Along with the reading guide in the back it evoked a great discussion for our Book Club.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|My kids turned me on to this because they were having so much fun. Now I am addicted! I love that they are always adding new features and content, allowing the ability to win items instead of having to use keys. Lots of fun to play!
081297381X|5|I really enjoyed this book, and I now have a much better appreciation of how events occur<br />in the real world of extremistan! I will now be on the lookout for Black Swans, Grey Swans<br />and even little baby black swans. I was not taking them into adequate consideration in<br />my investing. I really liked the part about \\"scalability\\" and allowing for the possibility<br />of running into a  White Swan. So now I am busy getting scaled up while at the same time<br />protecting myself against the Black Swans. Thank you Mr. Taleb!

1451695195|5|I found this account of NDE fascinating.  It was written by a pragmatic neurosurgeon, who had many of his former conceptions of life after death challenged by his own NDE. Although a member of a church, he had always questioned the concept of heaven/hell.  His descriptions of both were presented in this book in a non-denominational manner. As a Christian I feel his experience may reach those who are not believers because of his super logical approach to the earth-shattering experience he encountered.
B00932A6G4|2|Ok, there are enough reviews already so you can get an idea what to expect from this flick so let me instead ask a question. How is it that a crowd of troopers, standing on level ground, with dozens and of their own men standing several layers deep directly in front of them can all fire straight ahead and not tear the men standing in front of them into bits? That's the kind of laziness this film is filled with - mediocre CGI and lazy direction lacking any kind of coherent story. You can get away with this in a video game because at least you get to spend your time just blowing stuff up, but in a movie it gets boring pretty fast. It's a shame that the Starship Troopers movies keep accelerating down hill.<br /><br />Still waiting for a film version that sticks much more closely to the book. At this rate it isn't going to be happening any time soon.
B004X2M3N8|4|Love all things Doctor.  Delve deeper in to better effects and cheesier plot.  Still makes me cry, even to this day.
B0006IUDXA|5|Look, it's often cheesy, contrived, and poorly edited. Sappy as hell, too- but god help me, I love this show. Part of it's the nostalgia, part of it's Richard Dean Anderson (who has a sly sense of humor about himself that helps to smooth over some of the flaws), but mostly, I think, it's getting to watch a show that revels in its lead's intelligence. Too often we're told that brute strength is the only way to be a \\"real man,\\" the only way to be the sort of hero anybody can look up to; to get someone who succeeds because he's clever and reads a lot- that's just too cool for school. <br /> <br />The kid I was loved it. I'm just glad that the (sort of) grown-up me loves it just as much.
1567310540|3|The whole presence of Jamaica and everything on the around the island was great.  Fleming knew the place well.  There are some great aspects to this book, but no matter what the handling of the villain--the fascinating Dr.  No--was shoddy.  His discription of Dr. No is fantastic and the character,  or the little we learn of him, is one of the more intriguing villains in  all of the Fleming canon.  However, his early and rather laughable demise  just stinks of having nothing to do with the whole setup.  There was a big  blank after the death of Dr. No and I was like, huh?  The whole point was  to dump bird crap on him and wrap up this whole complicated mission.  Oh  well.  It's still a Fleming Bond, and I have yet to read a &quot;bad&quot;  one.  They are ALL good, but some are certainly stronger than others.  This  is on the weaker end but still very enjoyable.
034544678X|3|The book is very interesting, and gives a good incite into dog behavior. However it doesn't help you at all with preventing or correcting undesirable behaviors.  The author is probably very good at what she does but the book doesn't  impart any of that knowledge to the reader.
B005K17RU0|5|This app is easy to use and always correct. You can set multiple cities which is good for vacations and working in another city. Very helpful with children to know if there will be enough snow to cancel school.
B002QE3CTY|4|Well written and fun to read. I'm looking forward to the sequel. I think I'll watch the movie and see if they were able to capture the essence of the book.
B009EHDU7U|5|Funny and imaginative, this story will delight all readers - whatever your normal genre is.  A journey through modern political warfare, entwined with a current day adventure of the non-political, ever optimist Allan and the people he draws to him through his straightforward honesty.
B00GPWEPZ8|5|It was in excellent condtion package and movie wise.  Really like Tom Hanks a lot and he did not let me down<br />in his performance.  If anyone has ever been to Disneyland or Disney World , you would really like this movie.
B00BSZZA3I|3|Bought this for my dad. He didn't like it and returned the phone so I'm left with this phone case for no one to use.
B004EBZX6W|4|I needed to add a Wi Fi access point in a part of the house where Wi Fi coverage was spotty.<br />I bought this app so that I could monitor the relative strength of my Wi Fi network in different parts of the house, in order to judge the performance of the access point VS. the original Wi Fi router.<br />The app enabled me to monitor both the main Wi Fi (from the router) and the new access point together on the same screen.<br />I would recommend it to anyone wishing to monitor their Wi Fi network.
B0063IH60K|4|Like lots of quiet time, spend it with favorite games that keep me thinking.  Thanks for providing my spare time keeper.
B008Q0DAXK|4|Beautifully filmed and interwoven with wonderful music.  The story was intriguing but the acting was a bit irregular.  I would recommend to my friends who like Mozart and/or historical fiction.
0811826848|5|FIVE STARS! AAAAA+
B000003TA4|1|It's quite unbelievable how overrated Nirvana are, there is no other band in history that are regard so highly with so little work to show for it. Rolling Stone and other music magazine continue to eat up the rubbish Cobain and co. created, simply because they needed something new after the 80's to sell their publications. I admit that I own a lot of Nirvana's work, but I accept it for what it really is, watered down heavy metal with no lyrical or musical depth.     Where do your start with Nirvana's short coming. First of all they were presented as some kind of saviours of rock, who had come to save us from hair metal. A band that would bring content, along with heavy riffs. The truth is, Nirvana are a one hit wonder, they never really reached the standards smell like teen spirit set. People will always argue about the many classic on 'In Utero' or 'Unplugged in New York', but they really were just one hit wonders. Further more that one hit was a based on a riff stolen from Boston's 'More than a felling'. The fact is Nirvana and Kurt Cobain specially, are nothing but rip-off artists, the only difference between them and Oasis is that Oasis admitted they ripped off other bands. Nirvana stole riffs and ideas from everybody, Boston, Killing Joke, Mudhoney, Sonic Youth, and Meat Puppets. You name it, they stole it.     That brings me to the so called musical greatness that is Kurt Cobain, the biggest hack in history. I've seen Rolling Stone put him in there greatest song writers of all time and guitarists. Please the guy's songs were dull and repetitive and drug nightmares, even then he could not pull that off with the half ass class of Alice in Chains. His guitar work was awful. All his decent riffs were ripped off from other bands. His also an unbelievable hypocrite. He states that Pearl Jam are sell outs, but Nirvana were signed to Geffen and practically brought grunge to suburbia. He also appears on the cover of Bliss magazine and continues doe interviews for MTV,playing their poster boy for grunge. Who's the real sell out? He was so upset with becoming successful, why didn't he stop making videos and stop releasing singles like Pearl Jam. The truth is Kurt Cobain had no real talent, he stole a riff off Bosten and made a fortune, and when it was time for a follow, he could not cut it, so took the easy route and took his life, so people will forever go one about what he could have achieved. They guy is a hack and if he was still alive now, he still be a one hit wonder.
B005VPRET4|5|First of all, I have to say I don't agree with people who think these are a frail attempt for Lego to address gender biasing claims. These are great Lego's and different from most stuff that they have released previously. I think it is a great idea!<br /><br />My daughter got this set as a gift and she built it by herself for the first time (she is 7). Now that it is built, she uses it occasionally but my son (who is 5) really likes to play with this set as well!<br /><br />We like playing out military/police/counterTerrorism scenarios with our Legos. With this set, I can finally teach him the importance of soft targets as a method of progression with a guerrilla based campaign fought by an under equipped and under funded army. We set up our artillery on the coffee table and put \\"Outpost Screwed\\" (That's what we named it) out in the middle of the wood floor. If our artillery bombardment doesn't do the trick, we go in with our Armored Vehicles and supply .50 fire from a few hundred yards out. If all else fails (and if often does), we send in the foot soldiers to pull those cute little Lego Friends out by their boots and string 'em up on the Prince of Persia set we got 2 Christmases ago.<br /><br />The fun never ends in our house! I highly recommend this product.
B00004TWZF|4|I first saw this movie when it came out in the theaters...I was around 11 and I loved it from the start and I still love it. I can watch it a hundred times (I probably have) and still watch it again! Now some of that can be from my crush on Jean Marc Barr and my liking Jean Reno a lot, but I think it's a sweet movie. Actually, one time I rented the movie on DVD and I noticed they had changed the ending....instead of a sad ending, they made it a happy ending.... I don't know which I like better....But that doesn't matter. It's a great movie and I highly recommend seeing it if you're into stuff like this. A sweet romantic movie.
B00BEWCJFM|5|This is a monster. Classic Maiden with songs not often played live. Best song, Seventh son... Finally got it in live recording.
B002VPE1WK|5|This bag is incredible.  I looked at bags that cost 3 times as much and they are not any better.  The bag is fully padded and durable.  I can easily store my DSLR camera, two other lenses, a point and shoot camera, chargers, cords, etc,etc.  There are lots of pockets for accessories.  I can use it as a bag or backpack.  It fits easily in the overhead compartment on an airplane.  I can't say enough about this bag.
B004DLPXAO|5|As expected.
B002IYEQR4|3|I bought the first BluRay version of it, and at Best Buy the first week if you bought the movie, you got Tales of the Black Freighter for $5 more. I think that having the animation takes away from the film itself, and is better as a separate disk. If Black Freighter were live action, it would be a different story.     I get that it is coming out of a comic book and its ok that its animated, but it kinda slowes the film down. If you are super die hard fan and want the film to be EXACTLY like the graphic novel, which incorporates Black Freighter throughout, buy this version. If you're like me who likes the film as presented in the original Bluray version, with the extra footage, and feels like an animated side story would take away from the main story, making it a longer film, and would make it feel like its lagging, stick with the original. (When I got the Black Freighter I was lucky to get the Bluray version. The ad in the paper didn't specify bluray or reg dvd, so they sold me the Bluray version for 5 bucks. Regular price was $35!!! More than the actual movie, which was $24 at the time. $35 for a 25 minute animated short??? Come on, now! I lucked out i guess.)    In my opinion, Black Freighter should been included in the original bluray release instead of separate. You can see BF in its entirety, without interruption of the main film, which i thought was better. But this whole scam about selling separately then together really sucks. I wouldn't have BF if it werent $5 bucks. If anything, rent it!
B00486070K|3|I needed one of these as I use a macbook air (mountain lion) as my primary work laptop and connect to both wireless and wired networks.<br /><br />This review give the product 3 stars. If it was for my first adaptor it would be 1-2 stars. That one had the plastic sheath on the USB portion of the connector break and pull away in the first week of use.<br /><br />After the return/new cable I'd say it's 4 stars. Works flawlessly.<br /><br />I should note that both adaptors are extremely plug and play. Just plug them into any USB port on your mac and it'll be detected and set for DHCP automatically. No software installation needed. I've also used them with a static assignment and no issue there either.<br /><br />Hopefully if you do experience build quality issues like I did it happens early on and you can do a return.
0761169253|5|Thoroughly enjoyed Kleon's style of writing.  Great ideas.  Gave this book to my great niece, an aspiring artist.  Easy reading and re-reading.
B000YMBBH0|5|Movies are awesome in HD.  HD may have lost but since I have an HD DVD player, it is nice to get these movies at a great price.
1401224253|5|In every sense of the word, masterpiece describes this novel. A completely engrossing and exlporative way to engage with classic heroes and villains, Red Son is simply incredible. Buy it. Put it on a mantle. Tell your friends to do the same.
B00006M183|2|Forget creativity....WHERE'S THE GRUNGE!!<br />With each record, these guys get closer and closer to REO Speedwagon.  \\"Love Boat Captain\\"?  Sounds like a ballad for a Titanic movie made in the 70s.<br />Whatever happened to PJ classics like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Evenflow\\"?  It seems they've fallen by the wayside, allowing more talented bands like Creed and Nickelback to take over the grunge title from Vedder.<br />On the positive side, STP's new album should arrive soon.<br />Let's get it back to what it used to be, guys.  <br />TAKE CARE!!
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game. if really want a horse but can't afford it just get this game. and if your horse crazy like me this is the game for you.
B004SMD4H2|5|The show is fantastic, quite the departure from some of the crap that's out right now. The concept and stories are original and quite a mystery. When watching the show, I think I know who's the cause of the problem or how it's going to be resolved and I'm always blown away, because I'm always wrong. Love it. Now I have to get the othe three seasons as well.
B00F91RYL8|5|I had heard how horrible this movie was.  I enjoyed it.  I love Zombie movies.  However, there is never a cure.  Nor is there ever a way to get around the Zombies.<br /><br />This movie has a person that is very logical, and thinks through everything looking for clues on how to stop the spread of Zombies or to turn them back to people.<br /><br />It was interesting and true to life what happened to his family on the ship.  It was something that would make sense in Israel.  I have a great imagination, and a love for Zombie movies.  For me this was 5 stars.
B00000DGUG|1|However, that's not what I'm here to discuss. I am here to confront a song I heard on WSHE 100.3 in Orlando, and this was around Sept./Oct. 1998. I know it was from this album, and it was the ending of the song, and she sang about \\"Arse\\", and then does a harmonica solo. I've narrowed it down to 2 songs, and they are: \\"That I Would Be Good\\", and \\"UR\\". I use the word \\"Arse\\" because if I used the real word she sings this review will never be posted. Anyway the rest of this album is all over the place. It starts off with a pretty good song called \\"Front Row\\" which is a rather strong dance tune, but then it gel into hard rock sludge with \\"Baba\\", and from there it just seems to run the gauntlet. It was just alot of spitting in the wind as far as I'm concerned, and to me there has to be a better reason to visit India.
B00K7C17QW|5|This game is easy and fun the only thing is it takes a lot of energy so be prepared to pay in app purchasing.
B0048WQDIE|5|Must read.
B000SJJCX4|5|I have been refusing to buy a foot pedal tuner for a long time due to the cost alone. I just dont see a pedal that tunes costing $100 plus in most cases. I purchased 2 of these, one for myself (acoustic guitar) and my wife (electric Bass). THey work wonderfully and seem like they will last for a \\"very\\" long time. I'm not sure why you would spend $70 more so that you can stomp, slam, or throw your musical gear around. Foolish! Wonderful product for the money. Highly recommended.
B005LLSNNE|5|Can't stop watching!
B0002KVUKM|4|A Word To The Critics: If you're not into the genre, don't rate the film. This movie was panned so badly by every conceivable movie critic (except Ebert), it's a wonder anyone went to see it at all.  The only people qualified to comment on how good/bad a movie is should only be done by people who enjoy that kind of movie. It was very obvious that the same boring people who thought \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was the best thing since \\"The Piano\\", should not go see a horror movie. They don't have a background to judge it.  They should leave that sort of thing to the people who get into it --- like me!! <br /> <br />I love a good horror movie. Especially a good vampire/monster movie. And when you have more than one . . . all I need is a bag of popcorn, a superlarge drink and some Milk Duds and my afternoon is set!!  This was not Oscar material, but it was a great vampire/monster movie.  I made it a point not to watch too many ads so I'd be genuinely surprised at the characters and the developing plot line. <br /> <br />I have a great many gay friends, so I feel at liberty to say this next statement. Dracula was a flaming queen.  I was left to wonder which of his minion was the \\"father\\" of all those bat babies. It surely wasn't him. All he needed was some blue eye shadow and a gown and he surely would have passed as queen of the ball.  I think a stronger Dracula presence was needed in the film --- of course, in casting, why wouldn't you have a more unassuming Dracula character, deceiving in his fopishness, while stronger and more ruthless than anyone could imagine?  Why not indeed.  So maybe it was a good choice after all. <br /> <br />The vampire brides were deliciously wicked. I think they were actually the highlight of the film.  When the first bat babies started dying in mid-flight, the girls' expressions and agony were comic yet tragic. I literally loved seeing them suffer!! The Frankenstein monster was a great pick as well.  He showed great humanity through the makeup. <br /><br />Of course, the stoic Jackman made a picture perfect Van Helsing. All business, no nonsense at first -- and then they humanize him after his wolfman encounter.  Very effective characterization.  In fact, each character (except Dracula) seemed custom-fitted to their roles. I sort of expected a dreary overcast backdrop for most of the movie, but was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of light so the CGI effects could be shown with maximum intensity and clarity.  It was good stuff. The transformation sequences were excellent;  some of the best of recent memory and on a par with \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"X-Men\\" effects. <br /> <br />In all, you get what you expect with this flick and more. But if you go in looking for the existential meaning of the inner core of humanity, forget it. This ain't that movie.  If you want to see a vampire movie with a twist or two, a werewolf movie with at least one plot line developed, a Frankenstein movie that doesn't degrade the intent of the original and a vampire hunter movie that doesn't disappoint, then you can get all four movies in one with this one. <br /> <br />Why 4 stars instead of 5??  Because it's hard to develop a movie from a comic book and keep the storyline and plot development on a par with a made for film story. There are some gaps here and there but that doesn't make it a bad movie.  <br /> <br />Will I buy it when it comes out?  Of course.
B00005R87Q|4|This action-loaded rocker puts the pedal to the metal and rules the screen with incredible stunts, adventure, and very fast cars.<br />Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is the king of the Los Angeles street racing jungle. After a new guy by the name of Brian Spielman (Paul Walker) comes in wanting to race and take all for the win, Toretto agrees. Realizing that this toad has actually got the right foot to put on the high powered gas, Dominic lets him join his band of racing brothers and tries to get him racing some more. But what he fails to realize is that Spielman is actually an undercover cop sent in to nail them for robbing trucks carrying stolen electronics merchandise. With fully loaded tanks of NOS, the race begins.<br />What is so interesting about this adventure is that over the course of time, you forget that Paul Walker is actually a cop. You feel as though he's on Toretto's side. But reality breaks in when Brian must complete his mission in a last chance effort.<br />First off, the action is a rocket. The feel of traveling at 150 MPH actually sets in when watching the races. The dramatic aspect of the culture is really a bold tone that sends a shivering adrenaline rush through your spine. This film is mature enough to handle itself, while it seems as if one slip could send this film overboard. The stunts are incredible, and the plot (while simple and average seeming) is genious. The action delivers. I was impressed throughout it all. A sequel isn't demanded, but seemingly and most likely inevitable. <br />QUOTE: \\"Everything works. Everything sizzles. Everything makes it a great action picture. This film really gives a new meaning to the new-age \\"cool\\". The action is on overload, so be prepared for a thunderstorm of a distinct blend of pulse pounding adventure and brilliantly constructed plot that packs the fun. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a fire blazing tatomic action prodigy!\\"

0756404738|5|In many ways this book surpasses Name of the Wind. Yet in other ways it falls short of Name of the Wind. I have felt both books have been to short yet together they are over 1600 pages. Why is it? Because what Patrick Rothfuss has done can be called nothing but Art. When you pick up the book you think, \\"well how long will this take?\\" Then on your last page you think, \\"but I just started.\\" If you haven't read Name of the Wind, go read it. It's worth your time.

006097625X|5|I was interested in this book because I am a collector of vintage romance comics and I wanted more background in their development, but I was suprised to find that it fascinated me just as much as a professional fine artist.  Very clear &amp; great read, too.  Highly recommended.
031623480X|5|Everyone should read that book... Awesome...
B000068PQ7|4|It's a good solid work by Gene Clark. Play it again and again and it will really grow on you.
034554398X|5|Don't read this, it's a great book but, don't read it.  This is literature's top-of-the-mountain and it's just downhill from here.  After a Storm of Swords, reading anything else will be like biting on a piece of chocolate on Valentine's day; wildly difference flavors but, always mildly disappointing.<br /><br />Delicious from the first word to the last period, this roller coaster of memorable characters, plot twists and action will have you on the edge of whatever you happen to be sitting on.  You will love, you will hate, you will see it coming but, be taken by surprise, this...thing made me feel like no other piece of paper ever has or ever will.  He hurt me.  This jerk writer hurt me! On multiple occasions the book fell from my hands as my mind unraveled, processing what my eyes had deciphered.  The worst part?  It ends.  You will eventually turn the page and find a blank.  Heaven has an end, and that realization is my hell.<br /><br />Buy it guys, it's pretty neat.

B000002WYT|1|What is this garbage? This is perfect for those &quot;psuedo-intellectual&quot; college students who look forward to the weekend so they can go to their cheap dance clubs in hopes of finding  someone whom they can take home and sleep with. There is no emotion in this  music at all. It is simply a cheap, rehashed, corney derivitive of the oh  so boring and corney early 90s Pearl Jam era. Everyone i have ever known to  like this music spends most of their time drinking Molson canadian and  talking about their new Ski-doo they just dropped 6 g's on. Thank you Dave  Matthews for bringing the world of idiots together. as for the music? Dave  Matthews is one of the worst singers i have ever heard. The music is simple  and cheap. If i hear one more Ovation acoustic guitar being played on the  9th fret i'm gonna scream. This music makes me angry. With the hundreds of  great indie bands out their busting their buts, this makes it thru????? can  someone please explain this to me.
0307346617|5|Novellas are classic in the SciFi genre for getting across a theme in a brief encounter where background and personal history on superfluous characters are unimportant. This full length novel does the same thing, except each \\"chapter\\" is not unlike a novella that stands on its own.     The situations are real enough to be believable; the effects of herd mentality (think vestigial humanity.. er, MTV watching city folk) and rugged individualists on the breakdown of society are key themes. Whether in pitched battles, the living fleeing zombie hordes or your average friend/family is a zombie dilemma - this book will suck you in like a stellar black hole.
B00DR0PDNE|2|The quality of the video is amazing. I played youtube in Chrome browser from a windows laptop onto the TV.<br />One problem, a major one, is that if you are in a hotel where you connect to internet via  browser (by giving guest user id and password and by accepting the terms and conditions) as against just giving the password (WPA Security key) on your home router, the Chromecast doesn't work.<br />The Chromecast doesn't give you an option where you can enter the guest user id and password on a browser page. It always expects that you are connecting to a 'home' type of router and asks just for the router password.<br />This is a major disappointment.
B0006399FS|5|All you fans are fake, what is this that u2's new albulm is not good. I can bet that 90 percent of you out there are a bunch of adults from the 80's u2, bunch of old farts. You people cant expect the same thing over and over again. jUst like they once said..fans want new material..there you have it and you dont even like it!! u2 cant be 80's u2 because that wouldnt make any sense, its like if the beatles would still be out there recording albulms sounding like 70's music. You old farts have to move on. This music is way better than the crap that is being thrown out there today. As for u2 and apple merging, yea know your stuff, u2 doesnt get any money, and at least someone is trying to stop piracy, by writing some good music and inventing new ways of paying for music. U2 will always be the best rock band even if others dont like it. These lyrics on the new albulm all have a meaning, and i guess people dont like it because its just too good!  And yea, if you are a real u2 fan, you should know that each cd takes more than once to enjoy, but if you are a fake one just like thsese people i sense that are writing fake reviews knowing that they enjoy emenimen music, then go back to alisha , cynthia and all of the bunch of \\"fake\\" musicians who dont even write their own music!! Peace
B00GNAO796|4|The answer is simple; no. But what they did was remake this 70's classic and update it so well that this is a whole new thrill with some familiar moments. While watching it I was looking forward to certain key scenes and was already wondering how they would have recreated upcoming moments. And boy, was I pleased ! For as far as I had expectations this movie certainly lived up to them.<br /><br />Very well done !
B00OKYQZDI|5|Love this game.
0451191153|5|It took me a long freakin time to read this book, but it has really changed my life and stuff.  I now know that women, even if they are strong on the outside, like to fantasize about having themselves forced upon by rock quarry workers or similar blue-collar professions, like construction, or dog catching.  I feel like I've been WAY too nice to women.  Thanks, Ayn Rand!
0451196716|5|great book

B005EPFEPM|5|A must see film for everyone.  Cannot begin to put into words the beauty and power of this film. One of those rare documentaries you can't stop thinking or talking about.
B007HWTQQ8|5|Very powerful!!!
B00008QSA5|5|Classic Blues Disc redone in Digital.
B000MTPANQ|5|This may be more convincing proof of his genius than any other single album in his career (and it's been quite a career). Simply stunning. This is why I listen to music.
B005LF9AOQ|5|Great season! One of my favorites!
B002IFT1ZA|5|Game of Thrones is an incredible work of film. It is exciting, dark, suspenseful, violent and simply loads of fun.<br /><br />I bought Game of Thrones based on word of mouth recommendations and I was blown away from the start.  GOT simply possesses all the traits I look for in a series.  However, I knew GOT was special because, just like a good book, I couldnt stop watching it once I started.<br /><br />I gave GOT the highest review I could because once I started to watch it, I couldn't put it down.  That is really my benchmark for greatness as it's a very rare thing for me to start watching a television series and be glued to the tube for several of its episodes.  A great buy.
B00A8ECU24|1|This deletes all my progress!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAD JUST GOTTEN:Applejack,the BLACK IRIS,GOTTEN TO LEVEL 24,made the TREE OF HARMONY BE BETTER AGAIN,(which included having to spend around 140000 of your coins)  AND WASTED A LOT OF HARD WORK ON NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. So, I AM SUPER ANGRY PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!!!!!<br /><br />ALSO,you shouldn't make gems and stuff  be that expensive. Please make gems pop up more often.<br /><br />MAIN POINT : I AM NEVER,EVER,EVER PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN. PEOPLE OUT THERE,DON'T BUY THIS GAME. I USUALLY DON'T HAVE PROBLOMS  WHITH GAMES,BUT THIS IS IT.<br /><br />I DON'T OTHER GAMELOFT GAMES ARE VERY GOOD EITHER. THEVE DELETED MY PROGRESS MORE THAN ONCE.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,
B005UA0FLE|5|I like Bing Crosby, Andy Williams, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole and his style of singing is similar to them. I listened to the samples prior to purchasing the album and I really liked he sounded. Another album that we'll be listening as we do our drive to see the Christmas lighting displays.
B009KS4XRO|5|Would be nice for more credits with the cost of the card 110 a day ain't much like 2 cards in the bigger rooms
B00BVYNSLC|5|This is the best show I've seen since Lost.  The lead actress is amazing and the show moves along at a quick pace. A good mix of<br />sci-fi, action and humor.  Highly recommended!
B00EMXBDMA|5|Return with the protagonist to those thrilling days of the future when we first begin the exploration of Mars.<br /><br />If this doesn't make you wish you could kickstarter a NASA project, nothing will.
0321544080|5|Fabulous book, hilarious but very useful comments, great pictures!  I'm sure Joe is a great teacher and person!    Someone here said Joe didn't reveal everything. That is not true. He gives you more details in the beginning and as you read further, it's more about particular atmosphere or thoughts he used to create the particular image - NOT an instant-recipe for perfect photo!  Doesn't matter if you are a pro or a rookie, his thoughts could provide you with something you accidentally overlooked!    This book makes you think and use your brain, rather than copy/paste or steal his ideas!
B006VREHRS|4|Good show
B001UV4XIS|5|Took about 7 business days to get, but was worth it! Great quality! Great movie! Great ending! Sad to know this will be the last.
B004MC8CA2|5|This is the best app I own! I am truly NEVER without my Bible. I have the app in my IPhone, Kindle Fire and PC.  Therefore I can continue my reading any place any time or when I need some extra comfort. The app<br />comes with a connection to a great web site for direction on where, when, and what to read. I definitely suggest this app for everyone!
B00FLU0AQI|5|I like its album art and artist infornation feature the most.<br />Cool GUI.

B00IX9UTLU|5|great book. Kept me interested and wanting to keep readingWasnt expecting the ending at all.  Cant wait for book number 4.
B0094BB4TW|5|Doesn't give me a problem. I like the app. Its easy to use just like on any other device.  Thanks
B00I2TV3NO|4|Good movie
B003B02O7I|5|This book's storyline is riveting!  It includes the ravages of greed, lack of love, all of the addictions possible in America, as well as the peace of spirituality.  Well rounded coverage of the issues eroding lives of our society today.  A good read..
0879309210|5|This is a \\"Must\\" for any beginner who wants to save money and actually enjoy the experience of being a guitarist. Now that I have this book, I actually do consider myself a true guitarist. I have pride when I tell my friends \\"I take care of my guitar myself\\". I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to build their own guitars from anything from kits to garage sale parts. It even tells you what to look for and what to bring with you when you go buy a guitar (on the DVD). From common problems with stringing acoustics, adjusting any neck problem, to how to paint any axe. Those who are more serious, will enjoy the shop tool and benches he (and his friends) shows you how to build. Yes, there is a lot of product placement- buy this, buy that- but it doesn't require you to purchase anything. It just depends on how serious you want to get. I will own this book forever and will most likely purchase the next addition. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B00BSBR9N6|4|I thought the book was funny and I am now reading the Rosie Effect that follows it.
B00KA7JIII|5|I am a HUGE fan of MC Escher, and this game pleases me as such. The graphics are beautiful and simple, with a very clean and appropriate aesthetic. The gameplay follows with this. Performing actions and getting things done are completed with simple taps and swipes, which keeps interaction very easy. The puzzles follow a gently increasing difficulty curve that keeps you guessing. Innovative approaches to puzzles and environments means the game is always fresh. I would definitely buy this again and play it again!
B00CJGP116|5|Excellent
B00NFQT7QY|5|The best Marvel movie ever- neck to neck with the Avengers, LOVED THIS FILM
B003YNFYD8|5|Love their music from the past. Fast delivery without any problems. Cd's have great sound better than old 8-tracks.
B00009ZYBY|5|After reading many reviews of this movie raving about it as an action film, denouncing it as historically inaccurate, or anything in between, I would like to propose a different view.  Think of this movie as alternate history, the way things should have been, so to speak.  Anyone familiar with Marcus Aurelius the philosopher will recognize that Maximus was the embodiment of his ideal man:  at one with the universe, standing up to any adversity, accepting of all humanity, yet willing to fight for what is good and noble in the world, while recognizing how wretched the world can be.  If Marcus Aurelius could have created his heir, he would have created Maximus. Commodus was, historically, a wretched, depraved man.  While the facts about Commodus were incorrect in Gladiator, his character was aptly portrayed.  The story in this great movie - and I do think it is a great movie - could have been written by Marcus Aurelius himself: the way things s'posed to be.  Strength and honor!
B007J4T2G8|4|I must admit I read the novel because of all of the \\"anti-hype\\" surrounding it.  Yes, the poor reviews themselves were entertaining enough to lure me in.  I gave in and read the story simply for entertainment purposes; I wanted to laugh at how horribly written it was, how awful the sex scenes were and how juvenile her writing style was... BUT I DIDN'T!<br /><br />Okay, so if I finish a story, then it usually gets three stars or better.  Why?  Because the author kept me interested enough to read until the end, therefore there's no way I could morally deem it \\"awful\\".  I finished 50 Shades and was pleasantly surprised.  There were moments where I thought the main character was an imbecile (cough...Ana), but an idiotic character doesn't necessarily mean the author is stupid.  There was repetition, yes, but now I'm starting to wonder whether I noticed it because it occurred so often, or if I only picked up on it because everyone pointed it out.<br /><br />I am going to give E.L. James the benefit of the doubt because, honestly, I couldn't put the book down (this was a one-day endeavor for me), and although the ending was absurd (Ana, you set yourself up for that sh!t) and anticlimactic (har har), maybe the second one will turn things around.<br /><br />Finally, the story line was different.  This tale was not all sex as some reviews would lead you to believe; there were moments of psychological depth that literally had me intrigued.<br /><br />A new perspective... a new lifestyle... sprinklings of kinky sex.... I mean, that's pretty damn interesting.
B00AYDC5HY|4|My whole family loves watching Tim Burton films and this one is now on the list!  The character voices are done so well (especially Edgar) and I love the parallel to \\"Frankenstein\\" throughout the entire thing.  When you know how much work goes into Burton's creations you are astonished at the quality of the outcome.  Well done!
B004VYYA2K|5|I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas and thought it would be a good place to store her Barbies. She absolutely loves it!! The inside of the box once folded out looks like a house & the lid is a swimming pool. She plays with it all the time. Great buy!
B00L9B7IKE|5|I loved this story. Detailed. Intricate. Exciting.<br />I read it in a weekend and couldn't put it down.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|Love the game. Just hate that it takes so long to get the updates. Other than that it's my favorite HO game.
B004EBZX6W|5|Works great!!
B000FS9FCQ|3|This is a well made movie. It is enjoyable. But once again, we are asked to believe that the largest threats to our way of life come not from radical muslims and left wing loonies like Hugo Chavez, but from Christians, and from business corporations. The only truly free civilizations on this planet have come from the combination of those two entities. And now, they are supposed to be the bad guys in so many movies and comic books. What mischief is this causing to our culture?
B00594XOZU|2|I like it until it was kicking me out and when I signed out and It wouldn't let me back in it
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I love that authors like Colleen Hoover have a way of getting stories as tremendous as this out to the public. I have been feigning for a story like this only I hadn't realized until I read it! Now I know that some don't like stories featuring (gasp) reality but thats what this is along with its repercussions. I stalk this authors webpage for info on more of her stories and if she taps your veins like the book feign that you are, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF DOING THE SAME, pacing aimlessly chain smoking and wondering when the goods will be delivered....there's no shame... there's no shame !!HOPELESSLY ADDICTED
B000SEI230|5|I can not believe I read this book I. Only two days. Once I started it seemed as if it caught me and would not let go.  I laughed cried and had all the emotions the writer wanted me to have. He is truly a great writer to bring that much emotion over the reader with just his words and the story.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This is such a great game
B00I2TV3NO|4|Ok
0596009208|5|never read a better java book than this one.<br /><br />I really appreciate the writing method the author has used.
B0071XO8RA|5|Couldn't put the book down! I can't wait to read the others in this series. Such a great meaningful story.
B000V63AVY|4|Great compilation of Supertramp's hits. My personal favorite is School, but classics such as The Logical Song and Take The Long Way Home are irresistible. There are a few filler songs that aren't as memorable as the hits, but all the favorites are there.
B00992CF6W|2|My grand kids love the game I however am having a difficult time figuring it out.  I know that in time I will figure it out.
B0051QJ83S|1|Purchased the Lady Gaga \\"Born This Way\\" for $.99 and only have track numbers 2, 6, 8, 12 and 14 [total 5] in the \\"Cloud Drive\\". Did NOT try to download them yet since I read posts that Amazon is having problems with the links. Not to mention that the PDF isn't available either.
1400049628|5|This book is awesome, I totally recommend it. Especially if your into this kind of thing.
B0071XO8RA|4|This is pure delight.  Exciting, compelling and surprising.<br /><br />I am a little past the middle and going strong.<br /><br />You need to read this.
0062017926|4|This is one of my least favorite books in the Sigma Force series. I have read at least 4 of his books in this series alone and had higher hopes for this novel, especially since it deals with subject matter related to my field of studies. It took awhile to pick up, but once it did I enjoyed it.
B006GWO5NE|5|Does an outstanding job of charging our kindles. Very fast, easy to use a d is a very convient size.
B00ARA4SLU|4|note: Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar shortly after I wrote this review.<br /><br />Helen Mirren utterly engaged me as Alma Hitchcock, pretty much the unsung heroine behind the camera in all of his movies. Today she would be credited as a writer on the movie, at the very least. But Alma was content with her life.  She did exactly as she pleased and was an admired and talented woman.  Only the insiders knew about her but they valued her.  Mirren convinced me she was this character.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins successfully recreates Hitchcock.  He both looks and sounds like him.  But there aren't any big surprises with his role. He is pretty much everything you already knew about Hitchcock. However, he does it very well but the movie wouldn't have been very interesting had it been just he playing Hitchcock.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humor in the movie too but it is that low key British humor so you have to be attuned to it.  For example, when the screenwriter interviews with Hitch, he is late as he just left his daily appointment with his shrink.  Hitch doesn't think much of this info UNTIL the young man mentions the things he is talking about in it, especially about his mother. Hitch hires him on the spot and the next thing we know, he is seeing the shrink too! (The mother, Mrs. Bates, is key to the film PSYCHO, which is when the movie is set.) Hitch also interviews Anthony Perkins for the role of Norman Bates and that has its humorous moments as well. He tells Hitch he'd like to do PSYCHO as he doesn't want to get typed by the romantic parts he currently is playing for the studio. (The joke here is that after PSYCHO no one could ever see Perkins again as anyone but Norman Bates.) As they talk about Perkins' inner psyche, it turns out he too has a lot of issues about his mother.  After this talk, Hitch correctly guesses Perkins is bisexual or gay (this was true. Although married and with children, Perkins also was attracted to men and contracted HIV-AIDS and died of it at the height of the AIDS crisis). Norman Bates is supposed to be gay even though that is never said straight out in the film.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannssen and Jessica Biel nail Janet Leigh and Vera Miles respectively.  Everyone looks remarkably like their real life counterparts.<br /><br />If this were not a year awash in fabulous films, I might think this would do well on the awards circuit.  Mirren may even so. However I can't see this film winning up against the field of competition it is facing.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000GCFO0I|1|First, I haven't played the video game. I was hoping for a decent creepy movie. Did not deliver.<br /><br />Things aren't explained well throughout the movie. The mother drives her child to West Virginia. They don't tell you that they're going there all the way from Ohio until much later on when it's mentioned that her vehicle has Ohio plates. Which is the only time that it makes sense that the father cut off the credit cards. I thought she was just going down the road, not halfway across the country.<br /><br />The West Virginians have no accent whatsoever.<br /><br />It's tough to figure out what's happening, why people are doing what they are doing. A car crashes through a chain link fence and gate, and there isn't a scratch on the car.<br /><br />There are too many things that are shown, but not in enough detail to make out why the characters are so frightened. Why was the mother freaking out when she looked at a table? What was up with the scaffolding-type floor? Why wasn't there more shown of the janitor than a hand, a throat, and barbed wire? How did the mother know to take something out of the corpse's mouth? Who in their right mind walks up to a corpse and fishes around in its mouth for something that the audience can't even see in the first place? Why did the pyramid-head guy have a pyramid-thing on his head?<br /><br />It just... didn't make sense. It had the potential for being a real scarefest, but fell sadly short. Maybe if you liked the video game, you'll like the movie. But I wouldn't guarantee it.
B00594XOZU|5|THIS IS THE BEST ! I really love this App I can communicate with  my family with out a problem all .I have to do is look their Name up and send them a message
B00GMV8LIO|1|The only reason this was nominated for an Oscar, IMO, was the popularity of the cast. The story wasn't there. The dialog was spoken too fast with no meaning. Halfway into the movie, I still couldn't figure out the plot, ejected and returned it.
0790744295|5|Firstly I would like to say that CREEPSHOW is unlike any other horror movie.In other words ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!! CREEPSHOW is a collection of six fantastic mini tales all wrapped up into one EXTREMELY LONG movie!!<br />THE FRAMING STORY<br />Billy is a young boy who is deeply engrossed with horror comics.When he buys the first issue collectors edition of the brand new horror comic,CREEPSHOW,his father is furious and throws the precious comic away.The next day Billy uses his voodoo doll to hurt his father with in an evil act of revenge!! 1st story,FATHERS DAY... An evil father exacts revenge on his unlikable family when he comes back from the dead. (IN MY VEIW THIS IS THE BEST STORY!) 2nd story,THE LONESOME DEATH OF JORDY VERRILL... Stephen King plays a hillbilly who finds a meteor,which makes green weed grow all over his body.(THE WORST STORY IN MY VEIW!!) 3rd story,SOMETHING TO TIDE YOU OVER... A man buries a couple on the beach up to their necks,then the tide comes in.They die.They then come back from the dead and get revenge!!(IN MY VEIW AN EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING BLACK COMEDY!!) 4th story,THE CRATE... An evil monster breaks out of a box in a university and goes around murdering everyone.(THE MOST GORY STORY OF THE FILM!!) 5th and final story,THEY ARE CREEPING UP ON YOU... A nasty man with a HUGE FEAR of germs and bugs gets his just desserts when his extremely expensive penthouse apartment is invaded(and I mean INVADED)by huge,mean cockroaches!!(WARNING!!This story has a SICK ending!!)<br />In conlusion this FANTASTIC movie is an absolute MUST for horror fans everywhere!BUY IT WHILST YOU STILL CAN!!(made in 1982)
1451627289|5|One of my favorite King stories.  Well-written and the ending, while strange in typical King fashion, was satisfying.  If you like King, and Kennedy history, pick this one up.
B004AHNIGM|5|Look, do you what to hear authentic blues sung by one of the co-founding brothers of one of the greatest blues rock bands ever, the Allman Brothers Band, than buy this CD. This is Gregg Allman in exceptional form as a solo artist doing what he knows best - singing the blues. I'm not going to critique it because that's an exercise in futility and pointless. Gregg is the real deal, unlike the current barrel of American Idol \\"spooge monkeys\\" polluting the airwaves. T-Bone Burnett lends his \\"roots based\\" patina to the project and it blends perfectly with Gregg's style creating a real Delta Blues feeling without sounding over processed or pretentious. I recommend \\"Low Country Blues\\" very highly. If you don't enjoy it you shouldn't be listening to the blues.
B003R50FRI|5|With a myriad of engrossing characters, an interesting storyline and incite into many different peoples lives and circumstances - hard to put down
B00AREIAI8|5|It is awesome but don't buy any diamonds because you just earn more through the game and you can even name your wonderfully and beautiful horse... enjoy your horse ;)
B0089EHWQE|5|AMAZING!!!  I loved loved loved this book.  I wasn't drawn to the plot when I read the description, but I went ahead and bought it and I'm so glad I did!!  I laughed out loud many times.  I am going to work my way through all of Moyes's books now.
B0021L8V1Q|4|We watched Iron Man 2 in the cinema but failed to capture the quality we were looking for so we were very excited to finally be able to see this again in the comfort of our home in high-quality blu-ray format. I think no one else can get away with playing Iron Man except for Robert Downy, Jr. so I hope to see him in the sequels, if any. Anyway, to those who are thinking of getting this, it's worth collecting and watching over and over again. That way, you can be sure to get your money's worth. You may also download your own digital copy onto your PC and take the movie with you when you travel. I'm from Manila, Philippines. The version that they're selling here comes only in 2 discs and is even more expensive. You see, blu-ray still hasn't caught the eye of the typical movie-goer or collector where I'm from, except maybe from those like me who are movie enthusiasts, that's why blu-rays come out to be quite expensive for the regular person. And I'm talking about both the players and discs. But if you're aiming for quality and pure viewing pleasure, then this is worth the purchase.
B000XUBFE2|5|I have never before read such an unusual yet totally interesting book.  I loved the perspective of the narrator and was drawn into it as one is drawn into a painting. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
0553470485|5|Our kids love it (they've listened to it probably 20 times).  It is great for long trips in the car (and better than a movie).

B000002J09|5|Death's too good for anyone who doesn't like Zeppelin. Zeppelin totally kick @ss! If you buy this album you won't ever need  another rock album ever, excpet for anything by Zeppelin. It's so good that you'll play it constantly for the rest of your life. I know I do. Don't buy anything buy other bands. Zeppelin are IT. Zeppelin are so superior to other bands it's scary. Combine  all the talent in other bands and it still wouldn't be as much as in Jimmy Page's litte finger. The only other albums I listen to are Zeppelin, 1 Zeppelin 2,Zeppelin 3 and Physical Graffitti by Zeppelin.

B003TTIXOO|4|My daughter's and myself have watched Grey's from the beginning.  While each of us have come to our own opinions about each character, we all admired George.  He was the kind of guy who could be calm in an emergency, while at the same time....tug our hearts with his kindness.  This episode was just incredibly sad....hard to imagine G.A. without him.   Everyone I know will miss our favorite tv surgeon......bye Georgie!!!!

1401322786|5|I love all Mitch Albom's books. I have all of them.
B00JH3S0AI|5|Very interesting. I bet there are less than 50 words spoken in the entire movie.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This is a remarkable book in many ways.  First, it is extremely well-written.  The scenes are finely drawn and very evocative.  The characters are full-blown and varied in both their own personalities as well as in relationship to other characters.  The separate strains that link them are so finely woven that when they do combine, it is both surprising and anticipated.  Hard to beat that.  Mr. Doerr also depicts WW II in a very different fashion, mostly by focusing on non-combat issues and gives a surprisingly deep insight into the psyche of &#34;ordinary&#34; Germans.  A very strong and compelling book, it is easy to see why it won a Pulitzer Prize.
B008RA3X5E|4|muy buena
0823016714|3|Not bad, not great.  Worth buying if you're looking for inspiration and are already pretty good at drawing.  Might want to save it for later if you're just starting out, like me.
B00AMBLXP8|4|Usually things don't shock me much, but there are some scenes in this movie that kinda, made my jaw drop. But all in all it's pretty cute.
B002NXZY8K|2|Great movie but the picture quality was HORRIBLE!!!!!
B006L9B6TI|5|I was not a believer but my wife got me to read it.  The book definitely makes you think and provides a good positive platform to start your day.  I would recommend it just for that.
B00AA7V2Z0|5|Amazing show, creepy, witty, and well worth the watch.
B003JTHXOK|5|This book is very realistic. Shines a light on domestic abuse and courage. End of this book was amazing. Highly recommended.
B000ZEE3I6|3|This 6th movie in the Harry Potter series is tough to follow if you haven't seen the previous films. It picks up right where [[ASIN:B000W7F5SS The Order of the Phoenix]] ended, with characters all but lunging forward without backstories explained at all. If you are unaware of the importance of Bellatrix LaStrange (Helena Bonham Carter) for example, you'll not know why she is so intent of killing Harry.<br /><br />It makes \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" into a transitional film ala [[ASIN:B000FQJAJG Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back]]The tone moves from whimsical to dark, adolscence can be dangerous, and there are things about your family you may not want to know. This time, it is James Broadbent who carries secrets about the Dark Lord Voldemort that Harry and Dumbledore must find out. Ron and Hermione have trouble with love. Professor Snape (Alan Rickman, getting more from this role than ever) gets to slither into his darkness. And finally, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton, who finally gets to act instead of posture) reveals where his hatred of Harry originates.<br /><br />With all these \\"dark secrets revealed,\\" \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" doesn't answer them. The movie is still dazzling (the river of souls is amazing) and Hogwort's still inspires. The gang is acting their ages and getting up to age appropriate mischeif. But the movie ultimately stalls out...making it the weakest of the series so far.
B004QBWU02|4|Got This For My Mom She was Thrilled

B0091REZMW|2|Could b better
B000929AJQ|4|You could rightly argue this is his weakest album, but that's not the point.  This is a solid album, and certainly much better than the latest releases from other older artists like U2, The Cure, Billy Idol, etc.  There aren't any standout tracks like his other albums, but I liked all 13 songs and it's easy to listen to it all the way through.  Sure it's softer, smoother, less angular, but that doesn't make it any less dark and disturbed.  All of his mantras of self-doubt, self-hate and self-destruction are here, but maybe he doesn't feel like he has to scream them for 50 minutes.  Even the album closer, which is probably the most sedate, gave me chills thinking about what he was saying.  To me With Teeth is a natural progression from The Fragile, and I'm glad to see he's focusing more on the craft of songwriting with his voice as an instrument.  Instead of trying to aurally rape your ears, he's actually trying to bring his music and lyrics across.  Keep in mind the guy is getting older and has matured, so I expect his music to mature as well.  In that respect, he delivered everything I was hoping for and more.  For those who are disappointed with this album, I'm reminded of my sophomore year in high school when The Downward Spiral came out.  I remember the so-called hardcore NIN fans complaining it didn't sound like Broken or Pretty Hate Machine...yet now Downward Spiral is thought of as Trent's finest hour.  So my point is that you can't judge an album based on the back catalogue.  No matter how you look at it, With Teeth sounds like NIN, because as everybody learned from the first album, Trent Reznor is NIN.  For this album, he's just not wearing a black fishnet tank top.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Loved the history in this book... Writer was easy to read. My husband is reading it now, & likes it as much as I did.
B00HWWUQWQ|5|If you liked the others, you will like this one
B000NA28IE|1|When Eragon came out in the theaters I wanted to go see it, but didn't have time. When it came out on disc I was still too busy. My cousing let me borrow her books to read while at work. Loved the books so I wanted to rent the movie. I can honestly say I was sorely dissapointed. This movie is not \\"Faithfully adapted.\\" It's not even a good synopsis of the books. There is so much left out of the movie it seems as if the movie studio was concerned about time more than accurately portraying the film as a faithful rendition of the books. Don't waste your money on this movie.
B00A1EOBJQ|5|Love their albums.
B001AVCFK6|5|I bought this on DVD when it first came out, having been a Star Trek fan since my youth.  One of the joys of the original series was its inherent low-budget cheesiness, which is certainly lacking in this high-budget remake, but I think the modern version works quite well.  I won't get into the storyline here, that's been covered in other reviews.  I do think that the actors chosen for the classic roles did an excellent job with their characters.  And while Pine as Kirk and Quinto as Spock seem to get all the press, I really enjoy Karl Urban as McCoy - he steals every scene he's in.<br /><br />When my DVD copy got scratched somehow I went out and got the blu-ray.  It is amazingly crisp and clear, and the quality is excellent.  Glad to have it and will watch it many times.
B00AHSMDQY|3|I really wanted to love this movie - I am a big fan of the first and greatly enjoyed the second. There was just something off about it, and I couldn't place it until about 1:45 in and realized I've barely seen Batman. All in all, it was just a strangely paced movie - taking the first 2 hours to lead up to the third act that attempted to resolve 5 months of time in 45 minutes.<br /><br />On a positive note, the performances were great as usual, as well as the cinematography, just wish the plot wasn't so contrived.
B00G9C6USE|5|I did my daughter's room in Frozen.  Love the Elsa my favorite even though it took alot of patience to put up.

0670878014|4|Reason for Reading:  I intend to read the upcoming non-fiction title \\"The Lady and Her Monsters\\" which is about the writing and background of the creation of the novel \\"Frankenstein\\" so I thought it would be best if I re-read the book to better appreciate the former.<br /><br />I am a huge Frankenstein fan!  I first watched the Boris Karloff movie as a young child and have since seen it dozens of times.  I've seen all the MGM sequels and have a deluxe DVD edition with commentaries, etc.  I've also seen many, many different remakes, pastiches and parodies of the movie as well as reading Frankenstein themed retellings, comics and pastiches.  I have read this, the original book, once before when I was quite young.  It was one of the first books I took out of the library when I obtained an adult library card with special permission of my father at 12 or 13.  (You had to be 14, or in highschool, to get one at the time).  Needless to say at this point in time 30 years later, the movie version, specifically the James Whale (Boris Karloff) version is the one that I think of when I think of the Frankenstein story.<br /><br />When I went into reading this book I knew that it was a totally different story than what my mind recalls from the movies but I also remembered that it started in the Arctic with the monster relating his story to Frankenstein.  So from this I was totally blown away with how incredibly different the actual story is to the conceived modern notion of the tale.  The book is told in narrative form from three different points of view and is a story within a story within a story.  Starting off with a mariner writing home letters to his sister as he starts an Arctic expedition and then becomes stuck in ice he recounts his tale and his meeting of Victor Frankenstein who stumbles upon them near death in his mad chase of his creature.  Then Walton, the mariner, recounts the tale that Frankenstein relates to him of his life.  The awful, hideous story of his wretched life.  Halfway through this recounting Frankenstein stops to relate the story the creature pauses to tell him of his life story since he woke from the \\"spark of life\\" and wandered into the world on his own.  Then it goes back to Frankenstein's narrative and finally ends again with Walton's letters.  This way we get both Frankenstein and the creature's tales from their own mouths, in their own words as they were related to the person they spoke to.<br /><br />Neither Frankenstein or the creature are sympathetic which I found surprising, as in the movie I am deeply sympathetic to Karloff's monster.  But in the novel, he is a vile, wicked, murdering beast who at first thinks he has human compassion but quickly is turned from having any and easily finds violence and revenge better to his suiting when he is not treated fairly by others.  Frankenstein himself is simply mad, the quintessential mad scientist.  Obsessed with his creation he thinks of nothing else, working in solitude day and night until he completes his reanimation of life.  Upon first glimpse of this \\"life\\" he is so horrified that he runs from it and from this point on he becomes obsessed with finding it and destroying it, however the monster has developed his own lust for destroying Frankenstein and sets out to destroy him also, not bodily but in mind and soul by killing all who mean anything to him.<br /><br />A frightening tale that shows the futility and madness at playing God with science, even though the book mentions very little about religion.  This edition I read from \\"The Whole Story\\" edition is a wonderful annotated edition which really brings the classics to life.  The annotations don't particularly help explain the story any better, though there are some pictures and definitions of some items and devices one may not be familiar with.  The main purpose of these annotations is to set one geographically and historically within the place and era that the book was written. Profusely illustrated with etchings and paintings of place names mentioned in the story one becomes immersed in the scenery and in this book particularly the Gothic feel comes to life.  Historically we see the prisons of the time period, meet the Romantic poets and artists who shaped the life of the author and the mood which carried over into this novel.  I really enjoy and recommend this edition, have several others in the series and would pick up any others I found, but unfortunately they are out of print at this time.h etchings and paintings of place names mentioned in the story one becomes immersed in the scenery and in this book particularly the Gothic feel comes to life.

B00008H2LB|4|Having not put out an album in a while, I was mad with excitement when the news of Linkin Parks \\"Meteora\\" hit the streets. I was starved for Chester Bennington's hypnotic voice...and he delivered. I never thought it would be possible to outdo \\"Hybrid Theory\\", but they did. Not only is \\"Meteora\\" a clear show of the bands ever growing musical maturity, it also is a testament to the bands musical staying power as it takes chances with new sounds. I'm in love with Linkin Park all over again!...

0385504209|5|Brown crafts a fascinating story by combining things that are true and things that could be true. It's the only mystery I've read where I wish there were footnotes. It's a thriller, so the fast pace and twisting plot carry more weight than the characters.<br />If you like a great story with some interesting historical nuggets, read this. If you like a mystery based on religious themes but with intricate, nuanced characters, read Name of the Rose.<br />One more note: Some of the reviewers here have &quot;spoilers&quot; in their reviews. I wish they would add the note &quot;Spoiler&quot; to their headlines so folks who haven't read the book could skip them if they wish.
B000002TIK|5|The Grand Funk Railroad was a band that constantly reinvented themselves, almost with each album. At the beginning there were considered a Heavy Metal band (White Noise) of course even that part of there career has been reclassified as classic hard rock because of what Metal music has advanced too but it cannot be said that GFR is at least not a grandfather of Heavy Metal. GFR's first two albums On Time and Grand Funk (what we GFR Fanatics call The Red Album) were extremely heavy and somewhat simplistic (also GREAT). So when Closer To Home Came out it singled a change. Now this &quot;heavy Metal Band&quot; is showing the ability to change and showing versatility and more sophisticated lyrics. Closer to home is more of a blues based album there GFRs pervious efforts and It also contains GFR magus Opus (Best song) in my opinion I'm Your Captain Closer To Home. Its wonderful song and singer Songwriter Mark Farner said it came to him in a dream and that he believe God gave him this song to be meaningful to people. It has been meaningful to me for over 20 years now and to millions of others as well. The song is just a beautiful blend of melodic Guitar chords (Mark Farner) a great lead bass line (Mel Schacher) and wonderful drumming along (Don Brewer) with great lead vocals by Mark and wonderful Harmonies between Mark and Don, take all that and include a great orchestra blended and you have an all time rock classic. Closer to Home is worth the price just for I'm Your Captain Closer To Home alone, but that is not all. This album is great from start to finish. Sin's a Good Man's Brother is a hard rocker with an infectious groove. Aimless Lady a cool Bluesy rocker. Nothing is the same showed more sophistication in lyric writing for the young band and it rocks as well. Mean Mistreater and is slow down for the band a bluesy song crying out for lost love. Get it together is a fun (mostly) instrumental a nice grove provided by the rhythm section and some nice guitar chops at the end. Hooked On Love has that Gospel feel that influences much rock n roll from the 60s and early 70s, a typical we got to have Love song and a very good one. And Finally I'm Your Captian/Closer to home which is GFRs magus opus as I said previously. IYC/CTH is one of rock n rolls classic songs and its simply a beautiful songs. Coming form GFR such a heavy band at the time it was a big surprise. This album shows GFR still with gritty power but also shows striking maturity for the three young man, Mel, Don and Mark. This is one of Rock N Roll's classic hard rock album by one of Classic Rock's best bands. I would recommend this album to any hard rock/rock fan and any metal fan who wants to see the beginnings of modern hard rock and metal.end.

630264366X|5|To be honest, I, a serious convert to the Catholic faith, knew nothing about &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot; or the man which Gregory Peck portrays until yesterday, when I watched it on the History Channel (followed by a piece on Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust). This is truly a great film! The acting is top notch, and I cannot express my surprise at seeing &quot;The Sound of Music's&quot; leading man playing a commanding Nazi! Obviously filmed on and around it's beautiful location, this a film with a story that will inspire people of all faiths and backgrounds to stand up for what they believe and do what is right. My only complaint is that this film, in concurrence with present ideas, does not give the  deserved credit to the Venerable Pope Pius XII (they are books available about him on amazon.com ... &quot;Hitler's Pope&quot; by Cornwall IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!). Despite this rather annoying flaw, &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot; is a piece of cinema history, forgotten in a day when the Church is portrayed as a dark deluded organization (&quot;End of Days&quot;) or money hungry hypocrites (&quot;The Godfather III&quot;). Watch! Enjoy!

I hadn't heard of this movie 'til I was reading some reviews for &#34;Lucy&#34; that recommended it.  I&#34;m glad I bought it and will watch it a few times.  There's a lot to digest for only a single viewing.  Good stuff...

B0001IN07Q|3|With only 8 tracks on the CD, I feel a little cheated. To make matters worse, most of the tracks are from his first disc. The DVD is much better, however I could have done without the banter during and after the live performances. The ladies should love this one as Mr. Buble often peers deeply into the camera. He seems to be as much about himself as he is about his music, unlike Norah Jones or Diana Krall who are all about the music. If you are a Buble fanatic, you must rush out and buy this. If you are a casual fan, you can wait for the next studio release.
B00HXEWECI|3|Loved the special effects and production.  Wasn't crazy about the story.  Hated the ending.
0812589041|5|Card's best work (which says a lot, for he is head and shoulders above other writers).  Enders Game is the best book I have ever read, and I've read it numerous times.  I recommend it to all, not just sci-fi buffs, I  guarantee it will change your world.

B0027BOL4G|5|I think that everyone must see this film.  It is true that this film will change the way that you look at food!  Parts are disturbing to watch but it is crucial that we recognize where are food is really coming from.      This film also sheds light on how our fast food world has changed the entire food industry.  It is really true that everytime we make a purchase at the grocery store we are essentially placing a vote.

B0049J3RBC|5|Great Family Movie.
0393314804|5|If you like the movie and you've also got the soundtrack cds then go the whole hog and give it a read. It consists of a series of vignettes that were woven together superbly for the film. Readers might be put off initially by Welsh writing in a scottish dialect, but once you suss it out, it works most effectively in setting the scene and the characters - and there's a almost complete dictionary in the back. Some of the scenes are a tad grimmer than the film portrayed - hence the beauty of books allowing character development etc. But that said the film captured the essence of the book very, very well. The cover shows the cast of the film, and I think they did a grand job matching up the characters to the actors especially Begby.  <br /> <br />Welsh indicates how easy it is for the disenfranchised of the western world, and probably all cultures, to find themselves trying drugs \\"just the once, I can handle it\\" and then caught in the embrace of addition, needing the next fix and how to fund it etc.  <br /> <br />A very powerful protrayal of the sad and seedy world of drug addiction. (The \\"Mile End\\" track by Pulp captures it perfectly).  <br /> <br />Recommended!
B002PMPTIO|5|As a longtime fan I've watched the original series, many other series, and the sequence of movies. The original series had a certain bravado, a brashness, a ballsy celebration of life to it that, in my opinion, was slowly washed out of subsequent works due to political correctness and other influences. This movie brings cajones back to the franchise. The youthful excitement, abandon, and testosterone explodes on the screen. For much of the film the proverbial governor is removed pushing the envelope beyond suggested maximum warp speed. Watching this movie feels not just like watching Star Trek, but like being a kid again and watching the first series for the first time. Except for perhaps the most particular of purists, who will watch anyway, there is so much in this film for everyone whether they are new fans or old ones who want to see Star Trek once again as it was when the world was young.
B004FGMDOQ|5|I am so excited to have a new series of books that adults can love as much as children. I have already read the first two books of the series and cannot wait for the next one! Definitely worth a read!

B0026SCMNM|5|This was a good story. Loved the way he made the characters seem so real by the descriptions about everything about them.
B002DMJL9E|5|I have always LOVED this movie and now that it's in Blu Ray is all the better. This is the BEST of the 48hr series. The Blu Ray tranfer is excellent being that the movie is well over 20+ yeras old.
B000002J20|1|It's been a long time since I've heard this piece of pretentious rubbish, but what I remember the most is laughing out loud at the ridiculous liner notes. Jon Anderson pontificates about finding the meaning of our existence  in a hotel room in Tokyo, reading about Tantric yoga and the number 4 or  something like that. Reading this crap reminded me of Spinal Tap, in that  the whole thing seemed to be a parody of pretentious, prog rock excess,  when in fact it was the real thing! As far as the music goes, I just  remember Wakeman's pointless solos and Jon Anderson's PIERCING tenor. Ouch!  A roomie in college used to play this CD a lot and I had to beg him to not  play it anymore. He compromised and agreed only to play &quot;The Yes  Album&quot; and &quot;Fragile&quot; when I was home, while I agreed not to  play various non-prog selections in his presence. Anyway, I've gone on too  long. I won't say YES is devoid of worth, but this album certainly is.
B00BN2NY48|2|Like a weird 'New Age' circus performance. There appears to be an attempt at including some sort of plot, maybe, really it's just like a weird circus show without having to go to an actual circus. To be fair, the circus performance is excellent, just not what I was looking for in a 'movie'.
B000AJIF4E|5|Comfortable for hours.
B008AIGWVA|5|Cool funny
B0000CDLA7|5|Dream Theater still maintains their progressive metal roots but much heavier, angrier and more aggressive - I don't find it bad at all! This is actually one of the favorite albums by Dream Theater. There's definitley more technical guitar soloing by Petrucci on this CD and I love that! I don't find anything wrong with this album at all - it's just a heavier and sharper side to Dream Theater. There's quite a good amount of progressive music on this album as most of the songs run over 10 minutes! Riffs are heavy, guitar solos are very virtouso - I love it all!
B00BUCXVPI|4|interesting
B00C2VIA52|5|This is by far one of the best card games over amazon and is totally free, you must try it.
B0064X7FVE|4|The weather channel was the first on tv and first here in the app business. We can't expect any other app to produce a helpful weather report both condition and forecast that is updated often enough keep it interesting.
1558908382|1|I just saw this movie on Showtime and we didn't like it at all. Thought it was a dopey movie and most of all the fowl language. Saying the F word too many times and it sounds vulgar. Glad we saw this movie first before buying it. We liked Minnie Driver so much better Return To Me and Circle Of Friends, And Beautiful. Not this movie at all.
0684847817|5|If anything, it is Brian Froud's artwork to be amazed about. He pays special attention to the fine art of the drawing of fairies and it literally took my breath away. What a great addition it would make to one's library. I loved his previous works too. The descriptions are apt and delicious to read about. snuggle in and enjoy a great read and stunning pictures.
B002FQOI0A|5|Great book! Unpredictable and wonderful! I didn't want it to be over. I read it to my 10 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it so much.
B00000J2KR|5|This film is simply beautiful, a feast for the eyes. It has astark realism from the period; the actors did not use costumes, butactual antique clothes and Kubrick did not use any lighting other than natural light. Gorgeous cinematography captures the beauty of the English landscapes, beautiful sets and a nice score and screenplay (by Kubrick). The story follows the adventures of an Irish rogue who is prepared to do anything to build his way up in life. Kubricks' film seems like a painting; Kubrick found inspiration in the era's painters.  While long it is never boring and the actors shine, but the genius behind it is Kubrick. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!
B001AQTWF2|4|While not of the range or caliber of her earlier works, I look to you is a perfect vehicle for Whitney's return.  The title cut, is in heavy rotation on both r& b and gospel stations. It's one of those songs you play that make you feel grateful for your life.<br /><br />By the end of the CD I was impressed.  I'd not expected perfection and I didn't get it, but I can honestly say that there was only one song on the CD I wasn't crazy about. The lyrics are very personal and you'll find yourself wondering if she's talking about Bobby in \\"this\\" song.<br /><br />Bottom line - Whitney has been missed and this CD reminds you of all she lost and is struggling to regain.  She's not perfect but she's looking up.
B003JTHXOK|5|This book was warm and relating reading.  Recommend it for any woman.truly as I would expect from Nicholas Sparks.It is good bedtime reading.
0756407915|4|Similar to the first book. Filled with great writing and mystery. Liked the book a lot. my only knock is there are certain sections I find odd/ not that interesting and other sections I cannot put the book down = lack of consistency.
B00N1ZCGWG|4|My 3 year old granddaughter loved it and so did the 12 year old. As long as it stays free it will even keep adults entertained for a .
B001ANSS5K|4|I loved it. Except for the language. Maybe in the interest of being authentic, Green felt he had to pepper on the profanity. But can I just say that profanity is stupid. Why ruin a good book with important things to say by douching it? Why not try and get along with prudies as well as the potty-mouths? Even if you think it’s dumb?
B002JVWQSW|5|My family and I love this movie.  As we are watching we are often able to point out things a character will do that reminds of us of one of our own family members.  We haven't finished watching the DVD first season completely, but so far very enjoyable.
B007V2UGPE|5|This was one of the first. games I downloaded onto my girlfriends Kindle and now she has to fight me for it! Every morning when I wake up part of my routine is hitting the bathroom and this game keeps me company! The replayability of this game is insane. And just when you might get a board of these missions they flip the script and now you get to play as the bad guys and start all over again! My only issue is it should be called Samurai VS Demons but that's just me.
B0074D3CAQ|5|Harold Fry takes us on a 500 mile walk in rural England. The people he meets along the way and the culmination of his walk are both satisfying, and set a tone of peace.
B002ZG993Q|1|This is the stupidest movie I have ever seen. George Clooney at times stares in to space for no reason. They do not tell you who he works for or why he is in Italy and why he kills the Swedish girl at the start of the movie.The priest turns out to be the father of the towns mechanic no reason given. The only good thing in the movie is the beautiful prostitute.
B0020MKTOS|5|Clint Eastwood has always put out great pictures. It is so rewarding to see him grow, age and impart a theme. All of us get older, but Eastwood seems to encapsulate events that we can all relate to.
B007IXWL2C|5|I loved the series and this was a perfect ending.
B0000009SG|4|This half brilliant &amp; half signalling the demise into later ddogy FZ, but tracks like Dinah Moe Humm &amp; I'm the Slime are necessary [the version of the latter on You can't... vol 1 is better &amp; doesn't have  wanky guitar soloing], &amp; the rest are just fine except Ricky  Lancelotti's singing on 50-50 &amp; Zomby Woof &amp; also Kin Vassy's on  Montana are annoying [&amp; I don't get annoyed by Flo &amp; Eddie's by the  way]. It's generally quite listenable &amp; amusing &amp; goes well w/ '  from the next year. It just bugs me that some people think that this was  his 1st album &amp; don't dig up Freak Out! etc.
0143118706|2|To begin with Committed is barely what anybody would consider to be a follow up to EPL. If you were in love with EPL and were just looking for an extension to where her story had left off, you won't find it here. Committed is a weak compilation of her research on marriage and her whiny diatribes on why she isn't fit for the institution. I barely got through this and kicked and screamed the whole time.    There is no way that this book can truly even be defined as a memoir. In all reality this would have made a better diary entry than literary work. Don't read this book just to satisfy your nostalgia of EPL, you may ruin it.
B00KQFP5GS|2|Story dragged, not nearly as good as original.
B00MBVLCLW|5|I found out about JB a few years ago and have seen him live 3 times and going to see him later this year.<br />I have listen to the Cd twice. The first time I did not like a few songs so the second time was today. His first<br />all new material in years this is a brilliant album. It shows off many of the aspects of his talent and the different styles<br />he play his guitar. This second listening was more critical and I came away really enjoying this.<br />He has pulled off another outstanding CD.
B00I8H7APK|5|Wow! This movie was sooo good and made me smile the entire time. Good to know that happy exists. I even called my sister after watching to tell her to watch it ASAP!!
B006G3JQ78|5|A classic movie! The quality was great in High Deff! I recommend this movie for all ages! A must see!
B00BCZU8WM|3|I got the biggest headache listening to this cd. There's definitely some unique and nice sounds here, but it just goes on and on and on.<br /><br />JT's had 7-plus minute songs before, but unlike \\"What Goes Around\\" and \\"Lovestoned\\" - songs which change direction and justify the long length, these songs just keep doing the same things until you just can't take it anymore.<br /><br />I'm glad JT doesn't just do the usual 4 1/2 minute song, but I was expecting much more than just repetitive noise. Again, there is a basis for some great music here, but it just goes on way too much for my taste.<br /><br />I would suggest going to Target and getting the cd with the two extra songs. They're much closer to Justin's usual style of music than anything else here.
B00000IQBM|5|The Shining is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Jack Nicholson slowly going insane is one of the greatest things a horror movie could have.  Buy this movie, and I assure you you won't be dissapointed!
B00957T6X6|4|Superb writing, intelligent, but there is so much gore & violence its stressful to read!<br />Highly recommend if you enjoy lots of people getting their heads chopped and horses being killed in every imaginable manner.
B00CHSPB8Y|5|Very cool game great looking too..I haven't had time to get to far it's a little challenge for me but not hard to pick up
B0096HFOZO|5|You have to have a unique sense of humor or love Roald Dahl. But I read it to my grand kids and they lived it. Ages 3,6,and 8.
6303675212|4|This is a great holiday movie.  It is as good as the original
B00W6XM002|5|So fun! Love it!!!

B0063M22QO|3|This program was very simple. I prefer harder and more complex puzzles. I like playing mahjong a lot. I am getting older and like to challenge my mind.
B007SGLZP8|5|John Grisham, per usual, has written another novel guaranteed to keep your nose in a book (or Kindle) until the end.
B0067Q42BY|5|A little challenging but not too much so. Just a simple and fun match game.
B008EKOIN8|5|This is a tour d3 force containing all the things I didn't know about cooking. Well written, educational and fun. A damn good read.
B005OCFHHK|5|My son loves these movies! Hope that they don't wear out!! (joke).
B00E8KLWB4|4|A nice way to I'll time. The puzzles are challenging without being so difficult that I got frustrated and stopped playing.
B002MFX0RQ|5|You cannot miss with this well-written and excellently-casted classic.  Only the most jaded viewer will not be able to see that which cannot  be seen.
B00000JMQC|5|This movie was a movie that I so much enjoyed watching as a child and still do. Faruiza Balk did an amazing job as Dorothy Gale in her first movie ever. This movie had everything:great villains, beautiful scenery, great acting, laughter, chills, suspense, tears. At first when I saw that this movie was a continuation of The Wizard of Oz, I thought &quot;Oh great a sequel, it probably won't be good at all&quot; I thought that with many sequels they can't really live up to the first movie, but I was proved wrong. Return to Oz is amazing in every way. The villains such as the evil Princess Mombie was played to perfection by Jean Smart. Her acting was amazing, and even to this day she still gives me chills when I see her in this movie. The wheelers probably scared me the most and still do, just hearing their wheels squeak and their evil laughter frightens me, and the Gnome King is another great villain. It was nice to see some of the old Wizard of Oz characters return such as Scarecrow, the Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion and see new ones like Tik Tok, the Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead and Dorothy's companion in this movie Billina instead of Toto. If you loved Wizard of Oz then you will absolutely love this movie. Don't spend your money on some cheap, bloody slasher flick. Spend it on something worthwhile. Return to Oz is what great movie sequels are all about.
B004FGMDOQ|5|Couldn't put it down!<br />Worth the money, great fiction and easy to add history to for students. Fantastic and worth my time.
B009NFHF0Q|2|Not as good as the other books by Neil that I have read.  Feels more like he felt like he had to write something than wanted to write this one
B003JSSPSY|4|I enjoyed the whole series it's so much better than Merlin and more \\"Lord of The Rings\\", it has a wide field of adventures, and the main characters are diverse
1451648537|4|I wasn't sure what to expect from this biography.  In the end, I found it mostly to be a business biography.  How can you cover his personal and business life in a 600 page book?  There is too much to cover.  I was hoping for more personal information or thoughts from his wife on living with Jobs, but maybe that is another book.  As noted by others, I, too, found it interesting that his death is not mentioned at the end of the book.  I also would have preferred a more cronological book.  The skipping around became difficult to sometimes follow.  Yet, here is a man that gets us to pay $400 for a phone and love it.  He followed HIS vision, that you can say for sure.
B004ZISVWC|4|Great movie. So quirky and tongue in cheek. Had me laughing at all the weird, unexpected situations.
B003KUSUG8|5|This album is amazing!  Eminem is a lyrical genius!  SHADY IS BACK!  :)
B00FPOSDGY|5|If I could, I would rate We Were Liars with 17 million stars. This book was absolutely amazing, consisting of twists and turns only the best author is able to conjure. If you do happen across this book, don't pass it by; pick it up and don't stop reading until you turn the last page. &#60;3
B001RTP3Z0|5|I play this 2 disc CD set over and over in my car and do NOT get tired of it.  I also listen while working on my rubber stamping projects as wonderful background inspiration.  It's great!
B00LDNE3FG|3|Fun cool keeps stopping but watevs
0451468228|1|The story was a bore. WWII was in the background of this story, but readers will be subjected to endless, boring parties of high society. Ken Follett spends far too much time diving into the romantic relationships and aspirations of each character. Eventually, I stopped caring about any of the characters or the story because it seemed to lack any flavor.<br />As a Ken Follett fan, I was very disappointed with this book.
B0000024JN|5|Holy cow! This brings back memories of high school when these guys helped pave the way for Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and Linkin Park in that they were one of the first bands to mix rap, hip hop, and rock/metal for an unbeatable sound that is still popular! &#34;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&#34; is one of my favorite songs ever made! VERY popular to this day in clubs everywhere!
B0007GAEW6|5|Don't think I'm being negative about the album, but Frances the Mute reminds me of a hurricane. Frances the Mute has the force and energy of a hurricane, and just like a hurricane, it is breathtaking and amazing. The album starts off slow just like the light drizzle of rain one would feel at the beginning of a storm. All of a sudden, you are thrust into this tempest that is \\"Cygnus..Vismund Cygnus.\\" The energy builds up and sets the tone with this amazing Latin feel. Then you think the storm has passed when you reach the calm waters of \\"the Widow,\\" and that calmness is ended when you realize that this was only the eye of the hurricane. You are then plunged into the passionate sound of \\"L'Via L'Viaquez,\\" which is incredibly unique and could possibly be the most phenomenal track on the entire album. You are then tossed about the lamenting sound of \\"Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore.\\" This song gives a sense of peace but the lyrics and the music add to the torment of the storm. Finally, you are reaching the end when you come across the utterly amazing song \\"Cassandra Gemini.\\" Immediately you are hit with the energy of the vocals. The music builds you up and takes you through this storm with a whirl of differing sounds that blend beautifully. Once you've passed through this frenzy of feelings, you are reintroduced to the calm waters that assure you that \\"the ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens.\\"  <br /> <br />-Nefstar
B007ZGO7EM|5|If you are looking for a basic calculator this is it. It works great on a kindle fire, huge buttons.Works great for me and ads don't get in the way. Can't complain for free
B000002GXJ|4|This is a decent live album of their heyday, but I have to admit the Live at Melbourne DVD is superior to it, and costs less.     Back when they put this out, it made sense that the 15 songs included were the most they could put out at the time, songs like \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Life's Been Good\\" are long songs. However, 20 years later, having heard the bootlegs there's a lot of great songs they did live at the time missing.     Here's just a small list of the songs not on here that exist on bootlegs and I'm sure they have the masters:     Lyin Eyes, Witchy Woman, Tequila Sunrise, Already Gone, Peaceful Easy Feeling, One of These Nights, Best of My Love, In The City, Sad Cafe. Ol' 55. Those Shoes. Midnight Flyer. Doolin Dalton. James Dean. The Chuck Berry cover \\"Carol\\".     The Joe songs? Funk 49, Turn To Stone, Walk Away, Rocky Mountain Way.      It's a \\"good enough\\" collection of live songs, but it would be nice to hear some of these songs added in to make it an essential to have. A band known for excess fell short on this when it came time to put it out on CD.
B003JTHXOK|5|This is a very well written and a great story. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I would especially recommend it if you are  a Nicholas Sparks' fan.
B00DJFIMW6|4|not quite as good as the first movie, but my grandchildren loved it, especially my 3-year old grandson, whose favorite part was when the Minions turned blue!
B00AP9RQE4|5|How the heck did I miss reading any of these in SciFi reading career? I cut my teeth on Tom Swift, first editions I bought with lawn mowing income. This is hands down the best SciFi series of books I've ever read. I bought the first one and simply couldn't stop. The Flying Spaghetti monster only knows how many hours of sleep I missed and how much work time I procrastinated to read these books. I read them in the order the author recommended and they were right on target. Don't put it off, just buy them all now, tell your wife and kids goodbye and read your heart out.
B008VBYN80|5|Awesome game. That's how most gameloft are. you just have to like the theme of the game. If I had a million dollars then I would give half of it to them I know they make a lot of money with 6.99 games but some free games are awesome and I want to give them money to them If I would thanks for everything
0061849901|5|This is a classic. When reaseaching depression, this book always came up. It is an interesting read.
B00AIUUXHC|5|good game
B00005QZ7U|5|Moulin Rouge is a gorgeous movie. The costumes, cinematography, and art direction are spectacular and unlike anything since Cabaret.<br />Watch out for Nicole Kidman's sizzling performance as Satine. For the first half of the movie we see a person who is not ultimately rude or shallow, but a rather desperate woman who pretends she doesn't care and is just trying to live her life the way she's told. For the second half of the movie, we see an amazingly emotional, dramatic woman who is deeply in love and doesn't even know how to express herself. In Nicole's eyes we see the desperation and depression and the crying out for help. If only we could leap into our televisions and save her from pain, emotionally, physically, and mentally. In any other year, when Halle Berry's breathtaking work in Monster's Ball hadn't been nominated, Nicole would have won the Oscar.<br />I can't begin to describe Moulin Rouge. The whole thing is a gorgeous, dazzling drama turned into an electrifying cabaret. Ultimately though, this film is honestly about truth, beauty, freedom, and love. But they left one thing out- this movie is about sadness and the overcoming of sadness. If he ever could overcome it after the tragic ending.
B0064TVQ5E|1|hmmmm
B00MTGJ23E|3|Overall it was fun but not as good as others of its kind.
0312427646|5|While some found flaws or were just looking for more, most of our book club appreciated the breezy tone underlaid with subtle irony, and the theme of books as the building blocks of culture, community and connectedness -- perfect for a book club.  We liked the references to authors we've read, from Proust to Woolf (including the implied reference to Virginia's Common Reader), Wilde-worthy epigrams, and the queen chasing the corgi down the rabbit hole of a book mobile.  We even sniffed a note of Audrey Hepburn as royalty on the lam in Roman Holiday.  There was only mild disagreement on the ending:  a perfectly-executed twist, or a loss of grace with a clunk on the head.  Even so, we loved it -- and gave it a solid A.
B00CTEP7O4|4|Just watched the first few episodes of season one. It seems like an interesting show. I'm eager to see the next several shows.
B009UX2YAC|5|You probably know the game Subway surfers, and now on the beautiful display the game is even better!  I really recommend this game! Frankly it's addictive, and very fun. You won't want to put it down. And the best part is, it's free!
B0089LOG02|5|The author has done a wonderful job of integrating the overlapping stories of women from two different generations while giving life to train orphans.
B004EPZ06G|5|I really loved this movie. Would highly reccomend seeing this one.Amazon was a great site to work with, fast and friendly.
B007A4SDCG|5|Concisely written, no nonsense. If you are serious about reclaiming your creativity and are willing to change your thinking and behaviors, this book will give you the road map.
1439153663|5|My mom gave me this book for my birthday in October and I chose it for our book club to read this last month.  There is no question this is an excellent choice for a book club.  There is so much to talk about!  Slavery, alcoholism, parenting, family dynamics, and abuse are all topics that you will be sure to discuss.  My book also had discussion questions at the end of the book.<br /><br />With this book set during the late 1700's and into the 1800's, and in the south, there are certain expectations and rules that you have to remember.  Plantations were isolated from the outside world it seemed and really were their own little country, running themselves and living off of their own produced goods.  Slaves were common and their treatment was often tragically ruthless.  What sets this book apart from other books of this genre is that Lavinia lives in the slave world but is white.  She sees herself as one of them and doesn't understand that there is a difference between the two worlds.  So, once her life with the slaves is uprooted, her whole world is turned upside down.  Lavinia was very naive as to the societal expectations and social obligations and because of that, this novel has many interesting twists.<br /><br />This book is told is alternating chapters between Belle, a slave in the kitchen house, and Lavinia.  The naive telling of the story from Lavinia's perspective is compared to the harsh telling from Belle's perspective and in this way you get the whole story.  There are many characters in this story and it may be helpful to keep track of them all and their relationship to each other while you are reading.  The family of slaves is large and ever-growing throughout the story.<br /><br />At times, the story is difficult to read due to the atrocities that happened both to the white son and the slaves.  As the story builds, you begin to feel both anger and compassion towards those committing the violence.  Unfortunately, the lesson \\"hurting people hurt others\\" plays out in this story in many, many ways.<br /><br />As the story comes to a close, you will be sitting on the edge of your seat, reading the words and flipping the pages just as fast as you can to find out what will become of the characters.  If you are easily emotional, keep tissues close by.  The writer has built an interesting twist in the story that begins in the prologue and ends in the last nail-biting chapter.plays out in this story in many, many ways.<br /><br />As the story comes to a close, you will be sitting on the edge of your seat, reading the words and flipping the pages just as fast as you can to find out what will become of the characters.

B000QUTK6Y|4|This movie was so informative. I learned things about our government and the men that served our country during WWII.  Very true to life thanks to Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood.  Kudos for this one.
B002HJ9PTO|4|Bought this mic to record my neighbors while they were having sex. The mic cord was long enough without having to purchase an extended audio cable. I'm getting crystal clear audio from where I placed the mic. I look one star off though because the mic is a decent size and I'm afraid they might soon discover the mic. Until then, check my podcast for updates.
B000FS9FCQ|5|Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo!
B00910Y1OQ|5|So far, fully voiced cutscenes, great gameplay and pretty graphics.<br />Love it so far!
B0098460O4|5|These kids have fantastic voices. Everyone should see the You Tube video of their first appearance on Britain's Got Talent. The reaction was very similar to that of Susan Boyle when she first appeared on that show. Once again, don't judge a book by its cover. Although I usually don't listen to classical music, I could listen to this all day.
B00K4APIN0|5|This game is really awesome I had to delete for a different game then I downloaded it again.

0596007124|5|I bought this book because I got into the wave of designing software using UML designing tools.<br />As a beginner I found it useful but now looking back this won't save you from countless hours of breaking your head how to joggle with the design to fit in the requirements. And the childish design it actually helps. The books looks fluffy and this lets you see the skeleton of ideas from behind.<br />When talking about requirements I speak about memory footprint, speed of execution, flexibility, extensibility and so on.<br />I think this book will help you understand why the solution that you found by yourself actually work and improve the ones that you already have.<br />If you think that you'll become a good designer reading this, you are in for a big surprise.<br />As with most of things good guidance and a lot of work helps materialize a good theory.<br />Take the book and make a few designs. In the first designs don't think about any requirements just design to become able to spot the most obvious design mistakes.<br />Than go back and impose harder design requirements like how you can tweak  it to become faster or consume less memory while still analyzing the design from the book perspective. After a few designs you'll definitely become a better designer.<br />Another book that helped me was [[ASIN:0321334876 Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs (3rd Edition) (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)]]. This one is very practical and will help you understand that design patterns are dust in the eyes some times when memory and speed requirements are very tight.<br />This is my advice from my own experience. If it helps than I guess it is a good advice.

0385534639|5|The magic-realism of \\"The Night Circus\\" by Erin Morgenstern transcends any one category--one part the supernatural and the unexplained of the television show LOST; one part dream; one part love story.  \\"The Night Circus\\" captures everything mysterious and enthralling about fiction.  It is a story that echoes in the dark long after reading.<br /><br />Jéanpaul Ferro, author of Jazz by Honest Publishing
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game!! I absolutely love horses and I can't have a real one cause they are too expensive :(. But this game seems like the horses are real!! And the horses in this game will last forever and never die!!! And you can super awesome saddles, bridles, and more! I will definitely when I get kids, I will show them this game!! This game better not ever leave this world!!!
B00NFK0052|5|it was good
B00B7G3NFU|4|the talking didnt match the mouths and it got stuck a few times, but a great movie! peace on earth
B00HBQWGXK|4|A great read.  One of my favorite authors.  Who does't Like Jack Reacher?
B005HED11Y|5|Excellent video and audio quality for a tv show from the 60s..  Re-mastering and large hi-def TV's allow the original star trek series to be enjoyed all over again.  I was pleasantly surprised how good the picture quality is, although, the campy set episodes are very transparent in hi-def.
B007ZM9I1I|5|My husband was surprised to see that Santa Clause had left him this game under the tree.  Have not played it yet but it looks like fun.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Dowager Countess Grantham's wit does not disappoint after 4 seasons of this great glimpse into the world of English aristocracy.  She is still the absolute star of this cast of bluebloods.  I was delighted to see that horrible lady's maid depart Downton, but regret she left her  evil-doing partner in crime behind the wreck havoc both upstairs and down.  Downton survives in spite of his lordship who seems unable to change with the times as the ladies of the house show amazing good judgment and character at every turn.  I wish there were 30 episodes every season!

B00EKR61FM|5|I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this set is.  Not having seen any of the movies at all, I was looking forward to viewing them after just finishing the books.  I enjoyed them and the movies were just as good.
B00000IFWE|1|What a sad, mixed up, melancholy recording! Where are the rebellious rockers from the past that were advertised? I can't believe I waited for the store to open to be the first to buy this.  As a TP&amp;H fan since the 70's I have learned that a lot of their songs must &quot;grow&quot; on you.  I assure you that none of these will because I'm not even going to put this  in the CD rack for fear someone might accidentally play it. Whatever Tom's  influences were for these songs I hope he gets over it soon. One bad CD  does not a career make and I'll continue to be a Petty fan forever but this  effort is such a disappointment. If anyone is thinking about buying this  work PLEASE try to listen to it first. You may think it is Tom's greatest  piece of work or you may think it's a piece of ----.
B0027MJU00|4|Good book, not as good as gone girl, but entertaining none the less.  She really knows how to end a book!
B002MQYOFW|3|Purchased from Amazon for my Kindle at a good price.  I was glad I read this book since it was talked about in my family by young and not so young.  I found the book depressing and very much a downer so will not be reading the second or third ones in this series.
B000XUBFE2|5|Breathtaking...gut wrenching...a must read. The Book Thief is a tough young girl who shares her story while growing up in WWII.

B002QE3CTY|3|I found the story confusing. I'm not sure I'll continue with the series.  Maybe I'll come back to it later.
B00ABKGG0C|5|A very good story with interesting twists. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes the fantasy genre.
B002W5UVSM|5|so amazing and funny, so unique too
B005DN7W4G|5|I just watched this movie. This is my very first review I've ever written. I think it was a very good movie. The cast was surprisingly good. Great performance from Morgan Freeman. Nice to see Blake Underwood as well. There were several well known actors in the movie, including Elisha Wood, from the Lord of the Rings. It was very well done. The effects were first class and the story lines was thoughtful. It really touched me. I even shed a tear or two. Gives you something to think about, that's for sure. Enjoy!
B0060V1WJ6|4|I wouldn't classify this as a comedy in the same way I wouldn't call Spanglish with Adam Sandler a comedy either.  This may be why a lot of people didn't like it.<br /><br />The movie itself has a lot of real life stuff where the main character Cal (Steve Carell) realizes he is partly to blame for the break up of his marriage - even though she cheated on him with David (Kevin Bacon).  While Cal becomes a protege to Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a womanizer, he really just wants to be with his wife Emily (Julianne Moore).  As he tries to move on, Emily discovers that she kind of misses him too.<br /><br />The movie is full of plot twists and turns.  I won't say anymore, or it will spoil the movie. Overall, I think the movie would be a great movie to watch on a date night with your significant other or with a girlfriend (since it is a chick flick).  Despite some of the negative reviews I read, I didn't feel like they were justified (unless they were wanting something along the lines of The 40-yr-old Virgin comedy).
B00BD99JMW|5|Best Trilogy I have ever read. Amazing writing and always kept me guessing. I am encouraged to see what comes from Veronica's imagination in the future.
B006O5XYWG|3|The Redwood forest is not close to San Francisco.  Where did all the apes come from? There were only thirty or so in the primate center and that was all that Caesar up-lifted but soon after escaping, there were hundreds of them, maybe over a thousand, all up-lifted. The Army, Navy and the Air Force have bases near there,  yet not a single unit showed up.  But if you are willing to give them three impossibilities, the movie was pretty good.
B000OYC7A8|5|excelente, producto, todo bien.<br />recomende a amigos, y a familiares que es un buen producto y todo es seguro la compra
B008WOULPK|3|it was a lot of name dropping but no real depth into how and who she was as a person.  It is a lot like Vogue, the magazine - all glitter and gloss with no depth.  I did learn why the American Vogue is so British-centric - all the staff is from over there.  Reason why I quit buying Vogue and have turned to Elle and other magazines for fashion news that focus more on stateside talent!
B00993FRJS|1|Did not finish.....could not take it any longer.
B00004TH6O|5|Rated R is a flawless record in my opinion. It is on a rare occasion that I buy a cD that I can listen to the whole way through, multiple times and love every individual song. Feel Good Hit opens the album in all it's glory and has a really cool distorted solo. After listening to Feel Good Hit of the Summer, you can't help but finding yourself moments or hours later humming or tapping the song while driving, relaxing, or while doing work. Lost Art is good and has a wide variety of interesting sounds. Josh Homme's vocals are at his best here. Leg of Lamb is the most unique song I ever heard and you can see kind of how it later influences No One Knows on the next album. The solo in Leg of Lamb is simple, yet really awesome in it's high pitched tone. Auto-Pilot is definitley one of the top 3 songs on the album. Nick Oliveri displays excellent vocals with his bass work and Mark Lanegan shows off the best backing vocals I've ever heard towards the end. Better Living Through Chemistry is an odd song that I really cannot describe. It is really interesting near the end as the band fades in and out the main guitar riff, then Homme and Lanegan going \\"ahh...\\" You really have to hear this one to get it. Monsters in the Parasol is humorous and has a catchy little riff. Quick and To The Pointless is my second favorite. It's super catchy and easy to play on guitar. I got the tabs and am probably going to cover it at the next show I play. It's just really a rockin' song. When I saw the Queens live I flipped when they performed this song. In the Fade is the best. I love Mark Lanegan's voice. The chorus (\\"Live 'til you die...\\") is so great. It's a little slow, but fast enough to keep things interesting. Tension Head is the most heavy song on the album. I love it's super fast chorus and Nick Oliveri's gritty vocals. Lightning Song is a nice, cool relieving acoustic after that damn fast Tension Head song and I think I lOst My Headache is my least favorite but still is amazing, and I would prefer listening to it than many other artist's songs. The horn solo and monotone sounds at the end are kind of cool and funny, but many people may find these sounds annoying. I hope all who read this are helped out. I strongly recommend buying this more than any other album by the queens. If you're debating between this and Smashing Pumpkins, sorry, but I'd say go for the Pumpkins. Even though Rated R is flawless, I wish Ode To Clarissa and Never Say Never had made it on to the final album. I don't believe they were cut and made into b-sides. Oh well....
B00DUGCLY4|4|Fun to start out. Does get a bit hard to where you actually have to give it some thought.

B0071MV540|3|Meh
0385340567|1|I was going to write a review that hit all of the points mentioned in the other reviews.  Therefore, my review in detail is not necassary.  I agree with the points made about the silly criticism of the iraq war, the silly subplot of deserters(Lee Child should talk to some actual iraq vets and those still serving>  The soldiers over there have seen real evil, the terrorists and their iranian supporters, and they know what they are doing is important and necassary.), and the silly story of the injured husband.  If anything, Lee Child, from Britain, I believe, should see the care of injured american service personel as the damning of a national health service.  If wounded vets do not recieve the best of care,(just look to recent articles on prostrate surgery at va hospitals, 92 out of 116 of these procedures were incorrectly done), that should tell every american that national health care would be a disaster.  I also agree that his target audience is conservative anti-crime, pro-millitary readers.  Keep up the political silliness and I will stop reading this series.  I read these books to be entertained.  If I want left wing anti-millitary, anti-religion, anti-war on terrorism drivel, I'll watch CNN or MSNBC.  Also, the point where the police officer helping reacher refuses to wear her service pistol to a known dangerous situation because she doesn't wear her gun off duty was not only clumsy but it defied common sense.  It must reflect the reflexive european attitude toward private ownership of firearms.  Another point that Lee Child should keep in mind.  Many of the characters in his books would be alive if they were allowed to conceal and carry a firearm.
B00LTMIAF0|5|Fantastically haunting
B002A4Q652|5|The first time I listened to April Rain I was uplifted by the musicianship in the way each of the songs are put together. Each track is different and exquisite. Beautiful melodies and harmonies. I could not stop playing this cd, with each play There was something new in the magical sound. I love it and will always keep it as one of my favourites. This is a must album for the lover of DELAIN. There best yet.
B0031KE9C6|4|Very well written series, with interesting story arcs and complex characters.  Veronica is a modern Nancy Drew, but with the additional challenge of a fall from popularity to outright hatred.  What would crush another teenager only adds to her resolve to survive and thrive high school hell, all the while searching for the truth.  Season 2 promises to be just as interesting.

B005BCE7FQ|5|I have two kids, one 13 and the other 7 years old.  When we drive, they usually watch movies together if we can find one they both agree on.  It becoming increasingly more difficult.  The 13-year-old expressed reluctance but after the movie began, guess who was telling my wife and i that we were making too much noise. They talked amongst themselves while the movie was playing and laughing and joking about what they watched. After we returned, the 7-year-old wanted to see the movie again and we watched the blue-ray at home,  although I didn't watch the entire movie,  what i did see I did enjoy enough so I could watch the movie without reservation.

B00C5ZORES|3|... this is closer to Stump's \\"Soul Punk\\" than to the hard rock / punk pop that we've enjoyed from previous albums \\"Cork Tree\\", \\"Infinity\\" and even \\"Folie\\".  And this pains me because I love this band, and I really do like \\"Soul Punk\\" ... it's just a matter of expectations.  I expected / hoped Fall Out Boy would bring the rock, as the title of this album suggests -- or rather, demands.  But after the first two songs, it takes a decidedly turn away from rock.  At some point, I wondered if Fall Out Boy is really just two guys, per the cover ... Pro Tools replacing the job of Trohman and Hurley.<br /><br />I didn't like \\"Folie\\" at first either and it grew on me.  Here's hoping this one will do the same over time.
B0060AY6FO|5|a brilliant addition to the works of one of my favorite authors by another of my favorites. James captures Austin's spirit and brings her brilliance to life again in a style which is still clearly James--always a treat.
B00005LQ04|5|Even after all those years, since I saw the movie the first time, I still had the same amount of chills and the excitement while I watched it over and over again. It is one of the best suspense/horror type of movies I have ever seen. The colors, the decors, the special effects, and the performers are incredible. ENJOY!
B0002XH9Z4|5|The Best of the pop music
B00D7Z4GQY|5|The book kept my interest all the way.
B00CL6HGIK|3|This is most certainly not Wahlberg's best. The acting was weak, wooden, and the ending was, well, unbelievable, as in bad . And who let Russell Crowe in with that hairdo and strained New Yahk accent?  Glad I didn't pay for this in a theater. Amazon's rate made it a bit more palatable.
B0087JTAKW|5|As always he delivers a great book that really make you think. I loved the thinking behind this book the author always takes us places we might not have imagined ourselves.
B0007TKNL0|5|I like the older versions, but I just love this movie because of the absolute gloriousness of it all... Even after seeing this movie so many times, and this is my third copy to own, I still just imagine the Phantom to be the hero, especially with this actor in it... But, alas, the show must keep to the plot... Wonderful, wonderfully tragic, romantic... Great composing, awesome storyline to start conversation with...

0307341577|4|Since I had never read a Gillian Flynn novel, I decided to get my first one from the library (why spend the money if it may not be one you want to re-read.)  I was very glad that I made that decision.  While I appreciate the writing and the storytelling (hence the 4/5 stars I gave Dark Places), I will never re-read this book.  I think one of my Goodreads status updates says it best - \\"This book is making my heart hurt. It's a bit depressing.\\"<br /><br />Here is the synopsis from Amazon: \\"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ.  Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.\\" As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived-and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben its in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who've long forgotten her. The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her or details-proof they hope may free Ben-Libby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she'll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club...and maybe she'll admit her testimony wasn't so solid after all. As Libby's search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby's doomed family members-including Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started-on the run from a killer.\\"<br /><br />So...here's the deal - I didn't care for one single character in Dark Places.  All ofthem are just unlikable and not good people.  You would think that the flashback scenes showing Libby's mother and two younger sisters would at least give me someone to pull for (even if you know they're going to die.)  But, her mother was weak.  You have to read the book to find out how weak but it's disgusting to me personally.  I don't have kids but NO WAY would I do that to my family.  And, her sisters were pretty much brats.  That didn't make any of them deserve to die but they were just hard to like.  Libby, our MC, is not a good person.  She steals, lies and makes money off the horrible things that happened to her family.  The club members were disturbing to me.  Some of the women seemed to be prison groupies for Libby's brother.<br /><br />The conclusion of the murder mystery was well conceived and written.  But, again, it just made me sad.  So many bad decisions by all involved.  Ugh...<br /><br />I may read another Gillian Flynn novel.  She has a talent for storytelling.  I saw an interview with her where she was asked about these awful stories she writes and how she separates herself to try to have a normal life with her family.  She said that she writes in the basement and leaves her `crazy' down there.  I hope she can continue to do that for her family's sake.  Whew.<br /><br />4/5 stars but I can't say it was an enjoyable read.

B00005JODA|3|I didn't dislike \\"The Constant Gardener\\", but given it's critical buzz, it didn't live up to my expectations. In it, a British conservative bureaucrat marries a liberal activist who becomes involved in uncovering a pharmaceutical corporation conspiracy. She tries to prove impoverished Africans are being used to test new dangerous pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />Director Fernando Meirelles (City Of God), films a glorious, remote and colorful country focussing on the poor, highlighted by aerial panoramas of red-baked seaside cliffs, green roving, grassy plains, and raw images of ingenious peoples and locales. The cinematography overwhelms the topical but standard suspense-thriller story, becoming nearly condescending in it's constant touting of the real poor in Africa. The enormity and plight of starving diseased Africans stands like a giant next to the fictitious, and often thin, characterizations of the two lead characters.<br /><br />I couldn't buy the character of Tessa, as a humanitarian activist. Her character is flighty, a bleeding heart if you will, without roots to empathetic response to human suffering. She is more like a Peace Corp volunteer than a genuine activist. The emotional intention of the film may be to depict her as sweet and naive, but her superficial probing and brow bending suspicions, blunted a sharp edge the film may have possessed, had her character been more secure in responding to abusive global corporations.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, the second half of \\"The Constant Gardener\\", improves over the first considerably, as the 'suspense-thriller' dynamics are set into gear, and the chase, so to speak, is on. Before then, the constant merry-go-round romantics of the starry-eyed lead characters become superfluous and annoying. He loved, loved, loved her, with all his heart, heart, heart. We get, get, get it.<br /><br />As in his \\"City Of God\\", concerning the slums of Brazil, director Meirelles photographs a stunning human vista of a suffering and splendorous Africa. The conspiracy thriller aspect of it, is often only secondary.of a suffering and splendorous Africa. The conspiracy thriller aspect of it, is often only secondary.

1402714580|5|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.ust a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

B00BSBR9N6|5|A fast and enjoyable read - tough to put down, not too taxing on the brain, yet not a dumb read either. Very fun.
B00PTB7B34|5|In this game it uses real time for gathering resources and building things. It can Pisa you off that you must wait so long for it to finish building but in the end it is worth it. Attacking other basses and raiding them for your own is fun and available.  I would rate this 4, 4.5 maximum.

B004WCTLNY|4|This movie is a good Damon film with very positive message at the end of the movie.  Sure we all make choices in our lives, everyday choices what to eat, what to drink, so forth but everything else in my viewpoint is fate.  I personally enjoy this movie because me and my girlfriend who I will marry one day down road lost track of each other twice in our lifetime but found each other a 3rd time and this time were not losing each other for no reason.  The postive message in my viewpoint is if two people are meant to be together you fight to stay with that person no matter what lies within your path to them.  The plotline is easy to figure out and seen it before in tv shows and other movies, but I enjoy every moment of this movie and the acting job all the actors did to make it an enjoyable movie. Some will like it some will hate it, but watch the movie and see if you end up feeling like me about people being together and fighting to stay with them no matter what happens in your life to stop you from being with them.
B00005JKHP|1|<br />most interesting part of movie:I honestly cant think of any. <br /> <br /> <br />Why is it that when I watch this movie I can think of several star trek episodes which could have been redone to take it's this movies place??

But after a couple of chapters, his childish POV became taxing for the reader to follow and I would often skip ahead to get to the meat of the plot. Wish we could have gotten in the mother's head more...
B00846REIS|5|Better written than 50-Shades and I enjoyed it immensely.  Sylvia Day did an awesome job setting up this series.  I can't wait to read the next one.
0385504209|5|I thought this book was wonderful.  It is well written and very interesting.  I recommend this book to my friends and family.
B007IXWKUK|5|keeps you wanting more - purchased one book and had to have the other two - wish there was more
B000OCXFCO|5|Let me first start off by saying, I've been listening to Dave Mustaines music since the \\"No life til leather demos\\", about 24 years worth. No I'm not old and balding...but I do know a good record when I hear one! \\"United\\" is fantastic...each song flows well into the next, the sound is pure megadeth...EXCEPT: no David Ellefson! We all know about the lawsuit, but the \\"sound\\" of the band is different without his unique style of playing, which filled out the bands sound, I'm not saying they have gone all artsy Metallica....but the sound is a bit different. Only purist will hear this, THe Drover brothers are in top form here and the new Bass player J. Lomenzo has a good sound, but it's not in the fore front of each song like Ellefsons, you hear the bass, but it doesn't have the Ellefson SNAP! Dave's songwriting and playing are in top notch form here, not for the politically meek!! \\"Amerikhastan\\" is pure political dynamite, even Dave's reworking of \\"A tout le monde\\" is far better than the original version on \\"Youthanasia\\"...Christina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil was a perfect choice to duet with. Glen Drover has an incredible sound..his guitar playing reminds me of Chris Polands chops, Chris being the first Megadeth guitarist (and my favorite!) as far as I'm concerned Poland set the bar for every Guitarist that has ever set foot on a stage under the wings of Vic Rattlehead. NO ONE plays like poland, Save for Dave himself. The two of these guys together, would shread your face right off!! Shawn Drover is just an amazing drummer, His sound seems more like Nick Menza, but I don't want to insult Shawn Drover. Over all this record has a great look, sound and feel to it! Especially in todays world of Wars for Oil and a President buying into a system he designed to keep the American people down, Just ask the bodybags coming back from Iraq what they think! The Only thing that pisses me off about this record is that Dave recorded a version of Led Zeppelins \\"Out on the tiles\\" which isNOT on the american version, It's only on the Japanese import! Why I don't know, you'll have to ask Dave himself, but other than that...this record is worth the money!
B007D2XSW0|5|Luckily for us, there's a growing variety of photo editing apps for the Kindle Fire and other Android devices available here. Some are quite good for basic tasks, and some just don't cut it, to put it frankly. There are freebies and paid apps, so sometimes it's difficult to pick a good one that will meet the needs of a photographer who is looking for a higher level editing tool.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B007D2XSW0 PicShop]] photo editor is one of the good ones, especially with the newest 2.5.0 version, which fixed a few small but irritating bugs. At 17.5MB it's not exactly small, and it will take a little less than three minutes to download to your device, but once installed it's well worth the time and space. You then have a complete photo editing suite, with plenty of filters and effects from which to pick.<br /><br />You can read the specs here, which include the essential red-eye & blemish removal, image cropping, brightness & contrast, image sharpening & blurring, and a lot more. For this user, the social integration with Facebook and email have proven to be invaluable, though I have yet to try it with Twitter.<br /><br />The developer also offers the [[ASIN:B007FFZSE6 PicShop Lite]] app, a freebie that I first started with, then upgraded to this one. As far as photo editing apps go, as one who does a lot of on-the-fly editing of uploaded images, this app ranks up there with the more costly [[ASIN:B004OZK9VW PicSay Pro]], which offers slightly different functionalities. Both of these have proven to be among the best on the Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" for this user, but your experiences may be different depending on your Android device.<br /><br />Update 4/2/2013:<br /><br />Installed this 2.8.2 version on my Samsung Galaxy S III, and it is a good upgrade. Have had no problem with uploads to Facebook and there's a definate improvement in the layer resize performance with either the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" or the Galaxy S III.<br /><br />This [[ASIN:B007D2XSW0 PicShop Photo Editor]] offers much to casual and pro photographers alike. It does an excellent job with editing and transforming your photos. It's easy to use and highly recommended to photographers of all levels.<br /><br />12/1/2012; updated 4/2/2013cShop Photo Editor]] offers much to casual and pro photographers alike.

B00I8Q77Y0|5|this is a great game. almost exactly like the real thing! When I first got the appI had my doubts but I am surprisingly satisfied.
B00LPUSPRY|5|Great movie, my entire family loved it!!!
006016848X|2|I already new 90% of what was discussed in this book, just from being aware of what goes on around me.  You can see it demonstrated live just by watching Home Improvement.  I found myself becoming irritated at the style and voice the author used to convey his points and kept saying &quot;get to the meat.&quot;  But then, if he had, the book would be a pamphlet.  A serious waste of money.
B00M8JCW3E|5|Great cd.  And the price was right when I purchased it from Amazon.
B00IU0M85C|4|Original premise. Has me hooked
B00LTI52XW|5|Love it!
B009SJ3H8Q|5|My new obsession. This show is great. Can't get enough of it. Like lays you can't watch just one. Watch it.
B000I2J6K0|2|Yes, Erin O'Brien may be a personal trainer with is a certification after a number of \\"training hours\\" and probably would do a great job working at a gym with the general public.  Unfortunately she has VERY limited knowlege of the changes that happen physiologically within the body during pregnancy and the precautions that should be taken during this workout at various stages of pregnancy.  I am pregnant with my second child and am a physical therapist.  If I did not have a broad underatnding of precatutions that shoudl be taken not to damage my pelvis or low back during her numerous squats and one legged activities I would most likely have a significant injury that would cause me pain through the rest of my pregnancy.  Look elsewhere for a workout DVD by someone who specializes in womens health and fitness.
B004XQO90E|4|Really good sci-fi film by Duncan Jones. The BD price was very reasonable. I liked the really cool way the interactive extras worked, though this seems to require a linear approach involving viewing the film in it's entirety, more than once. Check out Jones previos film Moon, if you like this one.
B0020BUWX2|5|I loved this book, it was a fantastic story about a seventeen year old girl having to make a decision wether to stay or go.  who made her stay?? read this book and find out!!
B00MELK918|2|my least favorite in the series. I feel like this becoming more like a tedious soap opra series.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Grandson really enjoys this game
B0026IUXO2|5|It was an outstanding performance. I was hooked from  beginning to the very end. So hooked that I had to buy the second part to this movie.
6301008944|5|I discovered this movie when I was about twelve and my whole family loved it.  It was misadventure after misadventure, and definitely provided plenty of laughs.  I haven't seen it in quite a few years now, but I remember almost every word of it because I watched it so many times when I was younger.  It is one of the classics, in my humble opinion!<br />Every one is so spunky and loveable in this film, especially the red-haired kid whose favourite catchphrase is.  &quot;...Ya think?&quot;<br />I really reccommend this to families, (with kids over twelve).  The small amount of swearing and suggestive behaviour isn't enough to deter parents from letting their kids watch such an entertaining movie.  Well, I don't think it should be anyhoo.<br />The story is a real roller coaster ride, and a bit of a nail-biter, if like me, you tend to get caught up in the midst of things and forget that it's just a movie!  There is never a dull moment with this little gem.  Watch it, enjoy it and feel good, is all I'm trying to say.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|This game is brain-staining to the maximum. I was stumped on where to go next. A complete work out for the mind
B00AA0TJO8|5|such a cute game to play. my kids enjoy playing this on their kindle and it helps time pass by
B00006JJ51|5|Best Album Ever
B00AZMFK3K|3|It was ok movie. Not the Star Trek of old. The computer graphics were done really well. If you are into that, then its worth watching.
B0064GKEXC|5|Shipment arrived timely.  The collection of performances is a good survey of his final years, sometimes very moving.
B000HEWEE4|5|Most of us will agree that new love is one of the most endearing and exhiliarating experiences of our lives. But these days, sadly Hollywood rarely produces screen romances and films that demonstrate the power and excitement of growing love. Fortunately, due to the enthusiasm of Keanu, Sandra, and Alejandro Agresti in his first English film we have been gently reminded of love's magic and how a couple can fall in love through a growing correspondence and not through dating servies or emails. Although some of the professional critics have been harsh in their words over the Lake House because it's not totally logical or has gaps in its script, rarely have I met a viewer who wasn't at least a bit touched by the acting and Keanu and Sandra. I saw this movie in the theaters on the day of its premiere and recall a true-to-life comment of an American soldier who wanted the exact locations of Alex's tour of Chicago as he was taking his fiance to Chicago who loved the movie before he went on to Iraq. Several native Chicago residentsquickly answered his questions. For many of us, our favorite scene is the slow dance and resulting kiss  portion of the movie. It was a very long take to do and I wonder how many times Keanu and Sandra shot it to get it perfect which they did. Don't we all remember that tension and suspense of physical contact with a new love? That scene of this 2006 movie is already being compared to one of the all time romantic encounters of film history. We loved the innocent puppy love of these two actors in Speed but how they have grown and matured in their performances! Both shot up to star strastophere and salaries from that experience but I adore their characters in this film. Keanu, in particular, has encountered many tragedies in his own life since Speed and I am convinced it contributed to his depth, naturalness, and reality to his character of Alex Wyler. Some have not been happy with the ending-- even if it leaves us curious about the dog. Maybe she will show up in the DVD! Thank you Keanu and Sandra for the courage to do a \\"little\\"film and at this date I know have already proven the professional critics wrong on this movie's box office potential. Your screen chemistry is stronger and more mesmerising than before and thank you for your patience and wisdom for waiting for the \\"right\\"  screen vehicle to come along. But please don't wait another 12 years ! No recent screen couple can light and heat up the screen like the two of you and the viewing public wants more of you ASAP!
B0063IH60K|5|Enjoy playing and really like the daily challenge
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game, interesting matter, like the plot line and even the music is pleasing. Very nice graphics , easy to figure out. Some objects are very difficult to find but over all a good game.
B0086700CM|1|This games is so fun and addictive I would play it all day
B00F00A9U6|5|The show is excellent, perhaps one of their best performances. It covers their material from their greatest period, with just enough documentary elements to give you a better understanding of the show's significance to the group. Several reviewers have complained about the incessant jumping from one camera to another, and I do wish there were much less of that, but it didn't bother me nearly as much. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't seem to be selling the CDs separately, only packaged with a DVD (non-blu ray, but at least for Region A/1; see below).<br /><br />The film makes you realize that not only are they the best rock 'n roll band ever, but Jagger and Richards are musical geniuses to have written so many incredible songs. Probably almost no one would have believed you if you had said in 1969 that they were going to come back to the same place 44 years to the day later and do the same show, but do it better, except maybe Jagger himself. I saw him on I think it was the Mike Douglas show back in the mid to late 60s, and when asked if he could see himself doing the same thing when he was 50 or 60, his reply was an emphatic \\"Oh, yeah!\\" This was the last show of their 50th anniversary tour, and he turned 70 shortly after the concert and looked like he could go on forever.<br /><br />My warning is because this particular version of the blu ray disc is made for the European/African Zone B/2. The accent aigu on the \\"e\\" in edition is a give away, and it does say so in the product information, but the Amazon link for more information on what that means is worthless. There should be a much clearer warning. Some of the newer blu ray players will work with all regional material, but that's still the exception.
B000YABYLA|5|I purchased this item at a lower cost than any retail store in my area, and it arrived well in advance of when it was expected.  Nice product, great price and excellent shipping.  Thanks for an all-around smooth transaction.
B002UBRFDC|5|An epic adventure. This book has everything! Political intrigue, sex,philosophy,  adventure and an insight into 17TH Japan.  One of my all-time favorite books.
B008JFURII|5|Movie was just as good as first Red movie
B00VRYCGLO|5|A great app to relax after a long day of work. Some of the levels are little challenging to get a three star rating, so I just y st go back and play them again.
B00RL9WRAE|2|If you like action movies, which I do, you'll like this.  It's not the top of  the genre however.<br />Some very violent scenes.
B003UESJFG|5|A very entertaining film for all ages.  It doesn't follow the \\"typical\\" good vs bad theme by adding its own twist to the story.  With the glut of computer animated films flooding the market, this one stands out.
B0091REZMW|4|Have a great time with the different modes finding the objects, sometimes the description doesn't make sense. But other than that very fun to play.
B00DS5YUV4|5|I specially love the cell tower based trigger.  Using on Huawei Ascend Mate phone.
0790729369|5|This is a very touching movie that paces itself and eases it's characters into your mind and eventually your heart. This is a story about longing and desire. The acting is top notch by both leads, the romance very believable, and the story has every facet of the human experience. A beautifully told tale, and beautifully shot as well. The final scene is one of the most memorable scenes in recent film history, there are some very powerful moments here if you will pay attention and are not quick to judge this movie as many are. This is a real story with real characters not some contrived hollywood fluff.
B006JPS1OM|5|I have really enjoyed this game. The format is fun<br />and different. The graphics are nice. Lots of HO for<br />those that enjoy them. Plays well on my kindle fire.<br />The only drawback was the excessive time it took to<br />download.
0321525655|5|Besides the intelligence and expertise of the author, the reader also benefits from Reynolds's distillation of the wisdom and advice of his own masters and teachers - what a wonderful opportunity. The book is filled with everything you need to know about presentations before you turn  yourself (or your designer) loose with PowerPoint or Keynote. Besides the design advice, 100% of which rang true based on my experience, I found the technical info I was looking for (how big to make a photo to use as a background in PowerPoint) and a great list of photo sources. Reynolds obviously knows about creating books as well as designing presentations. I read Presentation Zen straight through from beginning to end, which I recommend.
B002XZOZQA|2|This is a horrible adaptation of one of the best American musicals of all time.  It's as if they cast the whole movie for dancing with no regard for acting.  There are some great dance sequences.  A lot of awful acting.  And a heartbreak story forced in where there was none in the stage version just to give Michael Douglas something to do.  Some of the great songs from the stage version are here, some are missing and replaced with bad songs written just for the movie.
B00EHMFC78|5|As always a great read
6305342776|5|Far and away the most worthwhile science-fiction film of the 1970's, and perhaps the most rewarding sci-fi experience since 2001.
B00FAPF5U0|4|I'm spending way too much time on this game.  It's addictive, but I love it.  The thing I don't like is being ask for money to continue to play.

B00D7Z4GQY|5|Great book!!
B0016Q2D5M|5|I have loved all of Brendan Fraser's projects.  He is a very entertaining actors.  This story was so much fun to watch.  Great family movie.
B000000WFF|5|Sometime in April of last year I got this little bug in me.  I just wanted to listen to the spice girls.  I had &quot;spice&quot; by them but not &quot;spiceworld.&quot;  So I bought it.  Now I have to say that this album is such fun and so much better than most of the pop out now.  You have &quot;spice up your life&quot; and &quot;do it&quot; on here.  Both songs are dance, full of movement and just full of energy!<br />Put this album on and you realize how much fun that time in your life actually was, how much you've changed but also how much you cna still look back on the old times and remember everything.  The spice girls ruled the world while they were around, and I didn't mind.
B004DLPXAO|3|I had the Kindle for Android on my HTC EVO and never had an issue with it. Now that I have the Kindle on my Galaxy IV, I constantly have issues with it syncing up to the last page read. I may be doing something wrong, but I don't think so. Will give it more time.

B003Y5H574|4|funny movies with good actors.
1601251831|5|This book is everything I expected and more. This may not hold true for others as it does not contain serious in-depth rules for playing monstrous races. It does contain new races, playable, new feats, and beautiful artwork. This is more than just a revision for monsters of the old Monster Manual, but a full-on remake of the old book.
B007TKT2SK|4|Good calculator, serves it purpose and I haven't found anything wrong with it. It works as it is supposed to.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Truly the most well written book I have read in a while. Amazing. The story gives the combination of tragedy, romance and comedy. The end will most definitely, leave you wanting more...
B003XF1XOQ|3|Loved the trilogy. Could not put it down. Just was overall disappointed with the story line compared to the first 2 books. Ended up being much more slow paced then I expected. The trilogy over all gets 4.5 stars.
B003R4ZMNQ|5|By far the best series of 2010-2011. The writers are top notch! twists and turns every place you turn. the 4 leads are the best! Alex and Scott are great! this is worth every penny to own! Love Love Love this series
B0064BCNA4|5|This a great app for me to practice a few notes of a song when I'm not around a piano.
B005COO1X6|3|As somebody who got hooked on King over 20 years ago, I was severely disappointed in this one. His character development of Pete was charming and well done while the rest of the story just quite didn't hit the mark. And the ending? That was just lazy.    The ONLY reason this got the 3rd star is that I liked Pete a whole lot.
B003MC5N28|5|It was hard to put this book down.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B0072S9KU4|2|I am not sure why I didn't like it. It was kind of creepy.
B00CF2UORK|3|Low resolution, 4x3 screen format.  Entertaining for my kids, but not educational.
B008Y2FRFO|5|like others said it is very addictive.  i kept playing to get more puzzle pieces.  once you solve some of the puzzles you will be able to play for a longer period of time with out running out of coins when you cash in the prizes.  read all of the prizes and choose the one that will benefit you the most at that time.  you don't have to do the one that comesup if you have enough of the other ones.
B007FEFLTO|5|Ken Follett is my very favorite author, I've read every book he has written that I can get my hands on or access to (thanks to Kindle) and Amazon.com.  Winter of the world was no exception to his talent in making historic fiction come alive.  I learned so much about the 2nd World War and the sequence of events as they occurred from this book.  I have already started on the next book in this Trilogy &#34;Edge of Eternity&#34; and it is just as engrossing.
B008MG1E4A|5|Excellent read!<br />Recommended for all who are even remotely interested in the mission to kill or capture Usama bin Ladin.
0399146253|4|I have to admit, I have been disappointed in the past two Scarpetta novels and actually held off buying Last Precinct until recently.  However, after reading it (very quickly I might add), I see much of the old Patricia Cornwell resurfacing.  <br />I enjoyed the movement and the plot of the book as well as the twists that never cease to amaze me.<br />I think that in an effort to please the reader, the author &quot;pumped out&quot; a few novels that we didn't find pleasing.  In response to us she has produced this one and I feel that we are seeing the resurrection of a good heroine.<br />So, I'm not giving up - I'm anxiously awaiting the next novel in the series.
B003P2WO5E|3|I was introduced to Sanderson through the &#34;Wheel Of Time&#34; series. As an avid reader, I had seen his work advertised before and it was on my &#34;read later&#34; list.<br /><br />I like the first two books and their length however, I am only reviewing the first book. In some ways, it is slow moving and slow to develop but this is not always a bad thing (at least for me). I won't reveal any spoiler type details but there are some parts that appear poorly contrived and somewhat implausible. It is possible the reasoning behind why the character(s) did what they did to be revealed later but I doubt it. Also, we are introduced to certain characters in short chapters that are never heard from again, with no real benefit to the storyline...yet. Trouble is, in a book this long, by the time the author gets around to reintroducing them (if that happens), both they and their earlier deeds have been almost forgotten (I have a great memory but thank goodness for Kindle Xray). Examples of some of my complaints above: 1. A six year war on the Shattered Plains, but there is no way around these plains to attack the enemy (the bridgemen seem to think they can walk far enough to escape)? They can't cross the plains and be done with it? 2. A great act of betrayal against Dalinar that is barely addressed.<br /><br />Regardless of my gripes above, the interesting storyline and characters far outweigh the minor complaints above. The main characters are fascinating and there is no shortage of character development. The storyline is interesting and the author introduces a lots and lots of details.<br /><br />If you like quick, shorter reads, this is not a series for you. If you like long and complex, this is something you may like. I am hoping for a very long series that doesn't get bogged down in the middle.<br /><br />So far, not the best and not the worst. Kinda in the middle so 3 stars.
B004ZJZQ7O|5|American Gangster will be what the godfather is today in a few decades. This movie blends action, suspense, and drama almost too perfectly and Denzel's performance is phenomenal. The bluray transfer looks great and the package comes with a digital copy and DVD for on the run purposes. Overall, for 9 bucks, this is totally worth it for an amazing film
B005PR422K|5|Brilliant book - a different way of starting a business. These techniques should be taught at MBA school as an alternate methodology
B001684L0A|5|Nothing has made me appreciate the American Revolution as much as this mini series. It also turned out to make for a great history lesson, as I found myself researching, reading, and learning what actually happened through out the series, for each episode.

B000UNYJXQ|5|Michael Moore's movie Sicko, is apparently designed to educate the American public regarding the issues of health care. The movie presents a comparative analysis of the health-care systems in America, Canada, France, England and Cuba. Michael Moore and his film crew actually visited all the countries discussed in the film, interviewed health-care professionals, and patients, and presented the fact in understandable details.<br /><br />Based on the film, health-care in America is very controversial. It is also a highly contested area in the legal and administrative arenas. The film shows how the health-care industry operates with hidden agenda, which is based on profit making. As a result, the average citizen is denied access to health-care payments for frivolous reasons. Such actions at times resulted in the unfortunate death of individuals being denied insurance coverage, or a family member who desperately needs the coverage to pay for medical bills not being covered.<br /><br />The film shows various former employees of the health-care industry providing information on what they used to do for their respective employers. The information is depressing. The actions of the insurance companies as portrayed by the former employees are ruthless, based on capitalistic motives, and show a lack of sensitivity for the health and welfare of others who are sick.<br /><br />One must consider the impact of the film on politicians. It actually computes in monetary terms the value of how much the health-care industry spends annually to buy politicians and get them into its corner. With the winning over of politicians, the health-care industry is then able to obtain votes and influence the passage of legislations in its favor which affects Americans across the spectrum.<br /><br />The film heightens ones awareness regarding the ongoing battle over healthcare coverage, and in particular, the health care debate and proposals by each candidate regarding where he or she stands on the issues. It shows the benefits to be derived from having a health-care system that is universal, and how it improves the quality of life for citizens of that country.<br /><br />The following is my poem regarding the health-care system in America, entitled This Land:<br /><br />This Land-America!<br /><br />This land we fought and died for<br /><br />Ancestral legacy buried in its midst;<br /><br />This land we shed our blood for<br /><br />Descendants suffering in its midst;<br /><br />This land we cried and bled for<br /><br />Future generation will be ticked;<br /><br />This land we stood and prayed for-<br /><br />Lord help and keep us on Your list!<br /><br />General Reactions<br /><br />Sicko is a present day reality of America's broken health-care system. It is beyond any reasonable comprehension to acknowledge the fact that the wealthiest country in the world is not even rated in the top 25% of countries world-wide for providing health-care to its citizens. This realization is just deplorable! It is an injustice to humanity to know that Americans are dying in the streets on a daily basis because America does not have an efficient and effective health-care system to provide for its citizens.<br /><br />One could assume that the ruthless practice of the health-care industry is designed to further continue the unjust act of covert genocide on certain segments of the American population. The system impacts African-Americans and other minorities the most. It is a further reflection of how capitalism and monopolistic practices by the upper class continue to act in a repressive manner to alienate those considered inferior by unjust standards.<br /><br />The timing of the film could not have been better especially being released before an election year.

0783216084|5|Unforgettable soundtrack (Theme from Jaws),brilliant plot ( man X mighty wild nature),one of the greatest and most creative directors of all times,great effects and tons of tension,extraordinary cast... this is  JAWS!It's a unique experience .After watching it,you'll never feel safe  once you're in the water(No matter if it's a pond,a lake,a river,a swimming  pool,the sea or the ocean).Even if you dream about floating in the water,or  there's water in your dreams be sure the quantity does not exceed 4  gallons! MY FAVORITE MOVIE ! It will be certainly remembered in  the  21st,22nd and all other centuries to come.It's a classic about our greatest  fears: hydrophobia!  and dying slowly!  After watching this movie get  into the water,close your eyes and you'll see what SPIELBERG really  meant!
B00687PWQG|5|Outstanding historical drama!
B00ATDOVNK|3|Fun game but annoyed that it's not really free like it says.  It's really a free demo that you can play through to a certain point and then you have to pay to unlock the rest.  Would have been nice to know up front.
B005IF7HNA|5|I recently saw an episode of Torchwood broadcast on BBC America.  It was the first time I had watched the tv show.  It was thrilling in so many ways...science fictiony, intelligent, moody, action-packed, sexy, imaginative, beautifully filmed, and totally enthralling!  I found a Blu-ray boxed set of the complete show here on Amazon and am loving being able to throw a disc in and get lost in Mr. Barrowman's eyes and grin and Gwen's home life whenever I want.
B00JVZ0DQG|3|Can't get my board to load so I can buy from co op members. It just keeps spinning the sun.
0634029355|5|Unless you are someone who dosen't have a clue and you mistake this DVD of Guitar Instruction for live Clapton Concert Footage: You will thoroughly enjoy this item.  This DVD is very well done: I would rate it excellent in the line of \\"Signiture Licks\\" instructional video. I would rate it up there with the Hendrix \\"Learn to Play Songs from Are You Experienced\\" video/DVD by Hal Leonard. This Clapton stroll down nostalgic lane is not as comprehensive as that but it is of the same superior quality.  I could have wished for more songs to be included but the ones that are included are must know songs for any Clapton student.  If you want live concert try the most recent \\"Live at Albert Hall Reunion Concert\\" : Even though the band seems uninspired and tired and the audiance seems way too subdued for a Cream concert, the music is still vibrant. I've been playing for almost 30 years and Clapton is one of my favorite teachers.  I still found the DVD very helpfull.  Beginner or seasoned vet will find much practical information and tips herein.  The instruction is clear and conscise. The Songs are Great! The tips and tricks are informative.  I couldn't let one misguided simpleton ruin this treasure for the rest of us. I highly recommend this DVD.
B000066I6N|4|After watching Robert Plant on Storytellers I went out and bought the album.  I was a Zeppelin fan but never really a ROBERT PLANT solo fan.  I was disapointed in the PAGE/PLANT studio album, but I think it had more to do with the way it was produced.  This album makes up for it.  I have listened to this album over and over and I can't get tired of it.  Good job Robert!!!
1594487154|2|Decent book, but not great. Certainly not groundbreaking. Nonetheless, there are some good thoughts worth knowing.
B006ID6NDQ|5|A vivid account of an extraordinary time giving us pause to reflect on how genocide continues to blight humanity across the decades since--this 'eternal recurrence' is driven home in Edith's realization near the end of the book that Fascism's shadow, in the form of Stalinist totalitarianism, means leaving the continent for good, literally. You do get the impression, though, that many of Edith's stated certainties--there's no way Britain will fall to the Nazis for one--are a product of after-the-fact reflection down the track. A minor issue. Read the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It's candy crush I played it on my other devices hence I was quite thrilled when Amazon afforded it to the kindle . The game is frustratingly addicted lolllll
B003EVWDR0|5|One of the best movies I've watched in years!  Masterfully done from start to finish, I found nothing to dislike and a great deal to love.  Highly recommended!
B00009W8N2|5|When first listening to Opeth's first album, I understood why it took them 4 years to conceive. The whole album beginning with the first track &quot;In the mist she was standing&quot; is incredible. The album starts off with a three minute guitar riff that will make any guitar player question his ability. Soon the album will progress into more heavy laden songs and finnally into a few instrumentals. I must recommend this to any metal fan around, you will love this album. I often find this to be their best album as well, definately give this one a look.
B00IKZX1ZI|1|Actually, I would give it NO stars!  Am not able to get into it.  It asks for your age and won't let you enter your age!  So you can't even get in it to see what it is.
B0055QYKQO|4|I bought this board for a mid range build. I paired it with the following:<br /><br />AMD FX-6100 processor<br />Hyper 212EVO CPU cooler<br />16GB Corsair Vengence 1600mhz DDR3 Ram<br />EVGA GTX560<br />OCZ Modxstream 600W PSU<br />ASUS DVD burner<br />WD Caviar 500gb HD<br /><br />I've built another AM3+ PC using an FX-8150 and Asus Crosshair V motherboard. I have loved this setup (Great BIOS/UEFI, really stable) and have had this machine running about 1 month now. I got this newer setup as a mid range machine to carry with me as I travel a good bit. The Gigabyte board installed easily in my Antec Lanboy Air case and I didn't have to update the BIOS in order to get the bulldozer chip to work (this is an issue on some early AM3+ boards from many different manufacturers). So, I get the entire machine up and running, windows installed, latest drivers installed, and downloaded the latest BIOS using Gigabytes updating software. Everything sounds good right?<br /><br />Well, if you're not overclocking then you can stop reading here because this board was super stable and it is perfect out of the box. However if you do overclock read further.<br /><br />I had weird throttling issues on the fx cpu and inconsistent core voltages. I disabled turbo core, c1e, c6e. There was no option to disable APM (or whatever the power management thing was called). Running Prime95, my multipliers would drop randomly, and although I had a 4.3 ghz overclock, I would frequently see only 3000 mhz using CPU-Z. I tried disabling different combinations of turbo core, C1E, LLC, etc. Nothing helped. Lots of other users apparently have had this issue (at least according to the forums I was researching). I tried almost all night with no luck. Then, I found out that there is a beta version of the bios on the Gigabyte website. You can't download it through Gigabyte's included software. You have to download from the website. I think it was F6K or something like that. Upon flashing this BIOS, I was able to disable APM (it was not there on the F5 version). This stopped all the throttling issues and now the board and CPU overclock like a champ. I have it stable at 4.3 ghz right now and CPU-Z is showing the correct speeds. Also, I no longer have big fluctuations on the core voltages.<br /><br />Getting over that small roadblock has really let this machine open up. Not much else to say...all the drivers worked, no loose heatsinks, all the ports are functioning, and I am very happy. I just wish that you didn't have to use a BETA bios for FX series processors in order to perform basic overclocking. These CPU's have been out since last year. It just seems like this would be out of beta form by now.
B000KZFMZI|5|I really enjoy these shows.
B0058VW36U|5|I bought this for my niece.  We have a great time playing it together.  It is a really great game.
B007IXWKUK|5|Out of the triology, this book is by far my favorite. I was soooo emotionally wrapped up in this story; it really tugged at my heartstrings with some very close to tears type moments. The story in this book is much more developed than the first book. I also enjoyed the dialogue between the characters more in this book than the first....alot of really good back and forth conversations/banter. Of course the sex is still there....as well as the Red Room. But again, for me that wasn't central to the story. The introductions to Jack Hyde, Lelia, and Elena (aka Mrs Robinson) were great to the story as well. I am very curious to see how this will all play out in a movie version. All in all, my favorite book of the three!
B000HKW7E0|4|like this movie, so funny
B005DI9HPI|3|This was a fun read for those who are vaguely familiar with New York. I don't think I will be reading any of the others in the series, such as I heart Paris.
B0041KKYEM|2|Nearly everything in this film is spot on until the final act; Aronofsky takes the story from deliciously dizzying to borderline ridiculous. You could feel the audience collectively refuse to suspend disbelief enough to have any sort of satisfaction at this curtain call. A shame that the bad ending spoils an otherwise beautiful and intriguing experience.
B00FVVR2ZO|3|OK I just started but there is a lot going on that I don't understand yet.  Has promise. . .  But I would have  liked better instructions.  My screen isn't very big and really hard to find some items.
0007172826|5|Don't plan on accomplishing much for a few days, as your nose will be in this book right up to the end. Gorgeous writing, sweeping word pictures that transport you, and poignant characters that will draw you into their lives. Tremendous book!
B008ZOHCKE|5|It's a llittle clinky but you get used to it.  It is ideal for those who take notes that are a little more permanent than reminders on a sticky notes.  You can create different note books for different topics.  It is free.  Try it.
B0054R6BFM|4|One day was all it took to finish, I guess you could say it is a quick read; however, it is so much more than that. The novel spans over just under 300 pages, and it hooks you from the start. The story is well written, and I could not put it down. The situations depicted in it are easy to relate to, and if you are in high school I strongly suggest giving this book a chance you will not regret it.
B008Y7EYSK|4|good
B00DPM7TIG|5|Well written, fascinating characters showing a different side to WW2 but just as sad and compelling. Highly recommend it.
B00127RAJY|5|I have fibromyalgia so I was losing hope on finding any way to lose some weight and getting very depressed. Nothing I would try worked. I had lost 10 pounds on the first 15 days of this workout and I am on level 2. It is awesome! My thanks to Jillian Michaels, she literally saved my life!!!!
B004SBQALA|4|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. There was enough action to keep entertained and enough supernatural events incorporated for it to remain interesting. It is a bit refreshing to see a movie that is not based on a book, cartoon, television show, is a remake, comes out in 3D, is a prequel or a sequel - unless of course this falls into one of these categories and I just do not know it :o)
B00ET0PZDO|5|I love puzzle type games and this one was first rate. The difficulty increased gradually not all at once. Was disappointed when I was through.
B00005KFUM|4|You may or you may not like the music Muse make, but you can't simply ignore it. At least not now. Although 'Showbiz', their debut, had an astonishingly good music coming from so young musicians, it didn't get the thumbs up you'd expect. The only reason mentioned: they're copycats. Well, it can't be denied that at times they really sounded a lot like Radiohead, but even it is so, is it a good enough reason to disregard music with that quality? The winds have changed. Radiohead have gone their way and Muse evolved into something you may even fear of. Introduced by the rather one-faced but tricky single 'Plug-In Baby', this album is really something close to a space opera. It is loud and atmospheric and it constantly morphes into something you didn't expect, led by one of the most original frontmen in the moment, Bellamy. That's about it. Don't want to be fun-spoiler. Cheers!
B007OTTSNU|5|Awesome documentary on MotoGP!
B00EW9GQR6|5|To me the best GaGa has done yet. Not as commercial as her earlier stuff, but great CD.
B003O86FMW|5|This is the second time I have read this book and it is still amazing!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait for the movie!
B00DGMVJAO|4|Great depiction of an old story told beautifully. The actors were perfectly cast. I love Ewan MacGregor and am always surprised by his acting. The special effects were staggering. Very realistic!
B005K17RU0|2|I enjoyed everything prior to the major changes and now I use another app this is just too much not simple as it once was it is too crowded no sat pics at all
B00FAX6XQC|5|takes up a lot of memory i deleted tons of games but i dont want to delete every thing but i seen someone play it on ipad and it was sweet
B007HJ84WS|1|Horrible, stay away from this!
B001DJ7PR8|4|As a general rule, I like Woody to be one of the main characters in his films.  That said, I do love Midnight in Paris. And Penelope Cruz.
B004UID2LC|5|Nice to have since there isn't a good alternative to have a youtube app on the kindle. Thanks a bunch!
B0007LGCB8|5|Being KEEN everything is as expected only the color is a little lighter shade than others I have seen.
B000002H33|5|I bought this CD a whilr back and it's great. It may only have 8 songs but they're 8 great ones. If you're worried about length keep  in mind that this is metallica. This CD is abot 50 minutes long. <br /> <br />The tracks go like this <br /> <br />1. Battery 5/5 <br />2. Master of Puppets 5/5 <br />3. Thing That Should Not Be 5/5 <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 5/5 <br />5. Disposable Heroes 5/5 <br />6. Leper Messiah 5/5 <br />7. Orion 4/5 <br />8. Damage, Inc. 5/5
B00VRYCGLO|4|Fun game. Very colorful!
B00GXKVZSW|4|Remake from movies, that being said, good acting/writing done very well...
B00CDCIQX6|5|An incredible movie that makes you think about the interconnectedness between us all. At first seemingly incongruous all the stories merge. Having watched this movie quite a few times, I keep finding more connections between the characters.
B00KNWYDU8|5|The game may send you unnecessary notifications but is fun to play and challenge Facebook friends.
B005HV6Y5W|1|Possibly the worst movie I have ever started to watch, turned off or fell asleep half way through.  Could not get through the dismal creation opening 30 minutes which seemed like a real lifetime!
B00P7PBD2C|5|Magnificent.  This is such an intelligent movie, well told, beautiful and emotional.  I loved it.
0345803493|5|Part of the addictive book series , make you want to know the results.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Downton Abbey provides a very useful look at a period of major transition in the culture of England.  This transition is also reflected in the US and in other European countries.
B00004Z4WR|5|OKay, so this isn't the greatest movie ever made, but I gave it my 5 stars because I had SO MUCH FUN WATCHING IT! I first bought the VHS version, then when I bought a Playstation 2 for the hubby 2 Christmases ago, we ordered the DVD. Totally worth it, in my opinion, because I love cars, Angelina Jolie and there are lots of little moments in the movie that were goofy and fun. (ie, \\"TV Trivia\\", \\"Boosting cars or having sex?\\" and Donnie trying to teach a little Asian woman to drive - I can laugh about that one especially since I am Asian myself :p)<br />Plenty of memorable characters and a killer soundtrack, too. So if you're looking for a rush of mindless humor and displays of loyalty between friends and family, take an hour & a half out of your day and watch this. You'll enjoy it - Eleanor will be glad you did too. *wink*
B005LAIIGC|5|Got this movie at a great price just before Easter, with these super cute little hopping eggs.  The eggs were a hit and the movie was on the most wanted list here at our house too.  Digital copy is a bummer, can't get the thing to upload to our ipod.
B00HDMMISA|4|Gripping, fast-paced and very originally structured.  I think the authro did a good job of portraying the thinking of normal godd women who have suffered abnormal bad situations.
B000PD3LIA|5|Love this so much!!!<br />This is the most expensive cd ever made!!!<br />But..... got it for a great price here at Amazon!!
B00G32QIEG|4|Love Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds! This was a funny, different, and interesting comedy, yet sweet towards the end. Very good movie! Love the CGI effects big time. Love that stuff! :-)
0767802470|5|great
B004VMUS9G|5|use it every day. it has not failed me yet. love the options. have recommended it to my friends and family.
B0018OIK0E|1|it is probably one of the worst movies that I have ever seen, I will do anything to remove it from my memory.
B000RF7XYO|5|Just love Elizabeth
B006DPXFVM|5|There are mant noticable scenes that were deleted from the original. It was a delight to see them make more sense of the story.
B0051MKMNC|5|I reccomend this seller and this product.  The movie was awesome, it arrived on time and in the condition stated.  I would deffinetly purchase more items from this seller.
B001KVZ6HK|5|Great to see such a good movie in 3D, nice depth, felt as if we were actually there.  I recommend this DVD
B00003IPFK|4|I ordered this dvd for my step-son for Christmas because it's one of his favorite movies. I'm very pleased with the seller. The dvd arrived promptly and in great condition...just as discribed.
0441009425|1|This review refers to the audiobook. I'll pass on a plot synopsis, partly because the publisher & other readers offer some, & partly because I'm several hours into the audiobook and still have scarcely a clue what's going on [Edit; I'm done, & still not sure.] There are several people on several planets &/or spaceships in several time periods, doing things, but I have no idea where it's all going, nor where it's been.<br />I haven't read the book in visual form and I'm not convinced even that would be comprehensible.  Part of the problem is the reader's fault; he does not pause,  even slightly, at scene or chapter changes. The book will jump character, time, & setting all at once but there is no cue at all to let the listener know of the transition.  I'm a lifelong reader of hard science fiction, but I'm not sure I could keep track of this tossed salad of who-when-where even in print.<br /><br />The character names do not help; on one ship there are people named what sounds like \\"Sudjick\\" &  \\"Sudjacki,\\" both of whom have rather cheesy Russian accents (though this could certainly be a device of the reader, along with cheesy French accents & cheesy Japanese accents: would people of the future, tooling around the universe, really have the same cartoonlike accents as today's?).<br />I've read &/or heard & enjoyed 2 other Alistair Reynold books --Pushing Ice & Century Rain.  I am definitely not enjoying this one; it's irritating as all hail.<br /><br />It's easy to believe that this is Reynold's first work; it has the neophyte's habit of tossing out cool, futuristic-sounding terms that mean nothing, sometimes defining them dozens of chapters after they first appear, often not bothering to define them at all, just dropping cool/techno words that leave the reader feeling sort of \\"primitive.\\" Some authors can create a new universe with its own terms and have it work -RM Meluch's \\"Merrimack\\" books spring to mind.  This author in this work fails utterly, and it is profoundly annoying to listen to.  I've backed up & re-listened to the first 4-5 chapters many times, trying to figure out what's going on, what those things are, and who is doing what where and when.  I also went back & checked several times to make sure this wasn't a sequel to another book, thinking a lot of this garbage must have been explained previously.  If I hadn't paid a lot for the audiobook, I would've thrown it out the metaphorical window.<br />I would strongly recommend that no one waste hard-earned money on this audiobook.annoying to listen to.

B007P3TMW2|1|The kid actor really sucks, at acting. Like I said it is Extremely Boring & Incredibly Stupid. I know this is about 9/11/01, but the kid was annoying.
B00005NKK8|5|Great soundtrack from my teenage years!
B00632HWOG|2|yahoo sucks
B005GG0MIS|5|Great insight into the world of our USA Presidents.<br />Authors gave great facts about both our current Presidente' and members of the Ex-President's Club,<br />Excellent book. Well written<br />Quality service from seller. 5 stars all way around Highly recommend<br />Read via Kindle...if you don't have a Kindle....what are you waiting on? Great way to purchase and read books
B00846REIS|5|Sylvia Day is a great writer. I read all three books in a week. I cannot wait for the next Crossfire Novel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5|I had a difficult time putting this book down!  By far my favorite book written by Sparks; the right amount of drama and romance.
0062255657|1|I read this for my book club. Not my type  of story I am not fond of fantasy  or syfy!
0887307280|5|Looking back, I can see all the errors or misconceptions we had in our previous businesses.  We will be implementing Michael Gerber's business model going forward.
B009C7JS14|3|I want the weekly forcast. Can only view hourly. Can't switch to a different view. What about tomorrow or the next day?
B0000549B0|5|I love this movie!  By the end you really start to see Harvey and forget that he is not really there.  This is one of James Stewart's best rolls.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, watch it now.
B000YHG72E|5|First time I ever saw this!  Loved it!
B00Y6QF0PE|5|It was amazing to finally see the other side of the story! I hope Erika will write the other two Fifty Shades books from Christian's perspective as well!
B00KA7JIII|5|Very cool game, really liked it. Hope they do some more in the same vein.

B002QXT7XK|3|This trailer for Stargate Universe (SGU) is a good preview for the upcoming season of this next installment in the Stargate franchise. I watched this preview before seeing the two-part first episode (see my full review there) and was pleased that it didn't give too much away, while providing just enough to get my interest.<br /><br />CFH
B003XF1XOQ|3|First and second books were the best. Took a little longer to read this one. Was alright though. Wish the ending was different.
B0009NCQJ6|1|I love Bond...the classical meets techno is amazing!<br /><br />When I saw they had a dual disc greatest hits CD, I knew I had to have it.  However, this CD is useless to me.  The copyright protection on the disc is such that not only can you not rip the CD to your hard drive or an MP3 player, you can't even play it at all on a computer.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with a CD I can't return because the packaging is open.  I don't own a boom box (...who does anymore?), so essentially this a greatest hits coaster.<br /><br />Save your money and buy the tracks you like from a legal MP3 source and make your own greatest hits CD.
B003NRYMZQ|5|If you like x files, odds are you'll like Torchwood. Complicated adult characters mixed with otherworldly and sometimes not so otherworldly crimes and mysteries. Warning for the sensitive: although the organization and the lead character (Capt Jack Harkness) came from Dr Who, this is a more mature series with violence and sexual situations.
B00FEMJF6O|5|With all Caps! The game is amazing , you can have farm and explore many things! I bet you'll love this awesome game!
B005CSWOHC|5|I really liked Kelly Rowland's first album, hated the second one and was looking forward to hearing this album. I was alittle disappointed that Kelly Rowland kept pushing back her album date. At first I thought it would hurt her album sales; I was wrong. I was also disappointed that her singles kept bombing on the charts (Rose Colored Glasses and Commander were hot tracks!). I figured she had alot of international chart success, giving her some clout behind some of her former Destiny's Child Members. Well, Motivation was received surprisingly well--surprisingly heading up to 20 on the 100 chart. I was excited for the buzz building up for this album, and when I received it. I loved it! It's a really good album. The perfect blend of dance and rnb is the perfect fit for Ms. Rowland. I was alittle nervous that her dance album would be  akward for American Audiences, so her mixing both sounds fit perfectly. (Especially since alot of rnb artists are doing it nowadays). It's the best rnb album I've heard this summer, and I think she'll have alot of success with future singles.
0156030306|3|In the first two hundred pages, Flowers for Algernon has been a good but sad reading about Charlie Gordon. Then, somehow, the mood sours for the last almost one hundred pages because Charlie has become emotionally screwed.<br /><br />Although the point is made, it is hard for me to get through the book to the end. Honestly, the inevitable end can have been made shorter since it is such a drag on my eyes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Daniel Keyes tries to associate intelligence with evil and rationalize the association because it seems to offer emptiness and perhaps hollowness in people's lives. I'll have to disagree with the statement because I've always considered it as a fulfilling part of life.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is a nice point about the need of an emotional balance to outweigh everything else to restore the order of a person's life. That's evidently what is missing in post-operation Charlie's life before his slow deterioration.<br /><br />Interestingly, Daniel Keyes throws in the socialization part as a way to feel fulfilled because that part was missing in the entirety of Charlie's life. I'll agree with the lack of fulfillment unless Charlie had a strong contacts through his networking.<br /><br />Granted, Fay is an absolute joke, and there might be a strong guess that the disorders may have run strongly in Rose's life, causing Charlie to become what he is.<br /><br />All in all, Flowers for Algernon is an up-and-down book for me to read, but it's been an interesting trip.
B00HXYKYIE|2|I usually like Jodi' Picoult&#34;s writing, but this was too much information about elephants. I liked the parts about people and didn't  see the ending coming
B0050XFY4O|5|This movie is simply beautiful. I love the story and the characters. I recommend it to you. But of course, you do not have to be agree with me. I am just giving my opion.

B004DI7HZ6|5|I adore this book. An adult version of Harry Potter mixed with Twilight. Awesome in audio book as well. Can't wait for book three!
B00FPH6M82|4|I liked it!
0307476073|5|I can't add anything useful to what other reviewers have said, so I'll just offer my two cents:  I'm a 49yo professional mom with three kids, and I loved it.
B00FMQINEM|5|Easy to  put on the wall and looks great!!
B008YKGQR4|5|This app is great because I can use my tablet for Facebook and have all the same features as if I were on my desktop computer. It is nice to be able to take it everywhere with me and check in on my new kindle.
B00006CXXU|5|Maybe some of you should have done research. Firstly, I won't go too far into the album as I'll let my five star rating speak for me. While I admit some of the tracks aren't exactly my favorite, I could listen straight through the whole CD without a single complaint. As far as these poorly rated reviews that aren't relevant at all, they're complete bull s*** . One comment in particular about her needing to be in therapy instead of having people constantly hear about her abuse, music is her therapy, and it's like that for many people. Another review I had read, stating they miss \\"The Old Christina\\" is also bulls***. Those songs weren't from the heart. They weren't from her soul and weren't connected and STRIPPED down like this album. And it wasn't personal at all, like this one. Yes, \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" may have been her kick start, but that shouldn't mold her image instantaneously. Nor should you cling to that. Haven't most of you noticed majority of artists sound AND style change when their sophomore album hits the market. This is because labels tend to be controlling and try to make their artists products, instead of the artists making.... well their product or art.. Christina has demonstrated multiple times she can be an independent artist. It's literally written all over this album. Her technique though ? Get over it.... if you really hated how she belts it out improperly or not you wouldn't listen long enough to sit here and write a book on it. Stripped is heartfelt and real. Credit is given where it's due Ms. Aguilera, nicely done
0060786523|5|I absolutely cannot say enough about this book. If first read it about five years ago, and, as I'm sure you will be, I approached it as a little bit of a challenge. As many people have commented, this book is so long its almost hard to hold, but as I got to the last few hundred pages, I kept wishing that there would be more and more and more. I never wanted to stop reading it. I read a lot of novels in a year, but very few have stuck with me the way this one has. Just say the words \\"A Suitable Boy\\" and I am transported back into the lives of the main characters, and I still get emotional over the choice the Lata makes.<br /><br />Many reviewers have also commented about how this is a sprawling family drama, which almost doesn't do justice to the way you, the reader, infiltrate these characters' lives, and that you learn an awful lot about Indian history. That is very true, and in fact, I think I know more about 1950's India, and Indian history in general, from reading this book than I do from a class I took in college on the subject, but A Suitable Boy isn't a history book. Seth doesn't wonder away from the story for a not-so-brief lecture on the history of land rights in India, he weaves these social and political concerns so effortlessly into the backdrop of this story that you're almost surprised in the end by how much you've learned.<br /><br />So if you're on the fence, not really sure if it's too long, or too dense, or if you're not a history or Indian culture buff, stop worrying. This book has something for absolutely everyone, and will make you love each and every one of the characters. From the moment Lata's mother declares she intends to find a husband for her daughter, to the very last page, you will be completely enthralled by this world.
B007SYWFRM|5|I  finally have a game my daughter and I enjoy together. we love the movie and now our new ice age village.
B00EHMG358|4|I am a big fan of these authors, this was a great teaser, though I must say this particular book seems to be a lot different than the rest of the Pendergast Novels. I am looking forward to reading the full book since I am a avid fan.
B00EKTCQCC|1|I really hate items that get listed, and after you download them they turn out to not be the real thing, but if you give them a whole lot of $$$ you can then get the real program.  So I deleted this from my Kindle and will not use it.
B0054JZC6E|4|This is a fun game to pass time. I really enjoy the many different games that are all in one download.
B001Q9J4PG|4|good read if you like Clancy style of writting
B00AHSMDQY|3|A pretty good senselessly violent movie that employs flashbacks in a failed attempt to usher subplots and extraneous story lines into a epiphanic climax.  If you like senseless violence, it is worth watching.  But the only value in this movie is in the action scenes.
B0001AP12G|2|You're alright
B00280LYIC|5|This book was the best! It was funny, and had a great middle, beginning and ending. Just try stopping the book in the middle of a chapter.
B00C7DGRL4|5|Good movie!
B0021L8V1Q|2|Iron man 2 sucked IMO...The story was decent and I wanted to see a new villain that's not dressed as another Ironman.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Two of my dearest friends in this world are walking through this thing called cancer... this story has given me keen insight into their journey... all while making me laugh and breaking my heart.  Well Done, Mr. Green!
B000002HEM|3|Little known fact: 10,000 Maniacs appeared on Unplugged in both of it's versions: the more well-known version that everyone and their mother seems to be on, and the original version, which was more focused on modern folk bands.<br />In any case: this CD was the last recording before Natalie Merchant left the band. It serves, in a strange way, as a Greatest Hits album. So why do I listen to it and just not get as worked up as I do for Like The Weather or Blind Man Zoo? Maybe a part of it is that I've never been enamored with the Unplugged series. I just didn't seem to get the idea that the band was into it. I give the idea that you could do better, in this case, to go for one of the earlier albums, and proceed from there.
B009SJ3GUK|3|Asylum was a good series but I thought the first season was better.
B00JAC25FM|5|fun game
B004UID2LC|1|APP IS NOT GOOD AT ALL . USES ALL LOT OF SPACE.  DO NOT LIKE IT.  NOT WORTH 5 OR EVEN 1
B00EDLP6O2|5|Just like the EAsports version of fight night. This  is a great app to delve into for those who enjoyed the old Fight Night series on Xbox. It's amazing how this looks and plays on the Kindle Fire HD. Worth every penny!
B0091VOHQM|5|Jet Li stars in this totally true, and in no way enhanced by Hollywood, tale of China's actual history.
B00IXF8PLU|4|Although a bit slow, the story was engaging, not predictable. In the midst of war and evil, horrific atrosities there is hope.
B000001GBJ|5|Every song in this CD has a story to tell you.  It kept me moving through the memories lanes.  It is beautiful, passionate but also has a sad melody to it.  It reminds of the Titanic movie, It is sad but unforgettable.
B0064X7FVE|5|Easy to use and simple set up. No extras or annoying adds. Just the weather  you need. Well worth the free instalment.
B000067IZ3|5|This film is truly a team film, because it does not have any true lead. All actors are supporting each other.<BR>Benicio Del Toro, you are a great actor and your character takes  time for his choices and has the biggest depth. In every true sense this role is supporting almost to the extent of being the backbone of the movie; Michael's,character has a few amazing scene and Don's character has this big, big finale of the movie after planting the last bug. <br />Criticsm:<BR>The film takes a moment to take off with storylines complex interwoven, as complex as all of the dealing with not only the drug wars, but wars as such.<BR>Soderbergh gives big moments to actors. <br />However, I felt that Catherine's character's biggest scene was cut, and should not have been cut, because she was giving birth to her choice. After finishing watching the movie I felt that Chaterine's character made the decision too quickly to turn criminal, the inner conflict was missing. How upset I was when I found the scene as Scene 9 from the Deleted Scenes in the Extra Features of the DVD. It was there, well filmed, brief and strong and probably taken away because the team did not want to victimize anyone into being a criminal.
B009XIXVU6|5|Another brilliant Hosseini novel! Vivid, alive characters intertwine with one another in a plot that twists and turns in and out of their<br /> lives. It holds your interest right to the end.<br /><br />.
0545425115|5|My daughter took the book and read it in 3 days. Then my wife. Now my sister in law has it. I can't get the book that I paid for!! They tell me it's awesome. And now the movie is out...and I still have not read the book.
B00OGMXQIG|5|Loved it.
B00002MZ2C|5|Rage Against the Machine returns triumphantly in their third CD, Battle of Los Angeles, with drilling guitar, extreme bass and beating drums.   Rage takes a hard and heavy stand against political and societal ills with  rhymes and beats that beat that of any other band.   This band, with an  actual goal behind their music- to help those facing oppression politically  or socially- takes taking a stand just a step farther.
B00013RC8O|5|Love it. Great movie.
0446573027|5|Hints and suspense throughout. Good story!
8590379825|5|this is definitely a treasure:<br />- cleaned and clearly explained concepts<br />- very pointed code samples<br />- very structured<br />- good for novice as well as veterans
B00C7TAF3Y|4|Love this game! It was way too short. A good game leaves me wanting more, however, this game was a nice challenge for a couple of days.
B008Y768XO|5|Huge tear jerker! Great movie!
B007J4T2G8|5|I've been wanting to read this book forever because of the comments I was given about it. I can say one thing for sure....she's more woman than I'll ever be to go thru what she did. I wish there was more to this story than what it is. But all in all....I loved it.
B00448SE4S|5|Great product, Great Seller
B00DPM7TIG|4|It's a book about war but is about decisions and circumstances of all. I enjoyed the characters and the variety of places that are introduced and developed in the story. The reliance on radios seems outdated in our era but this story cleverly shares their importance and significance in our not so distant past.
B003O86FMW|2|I thought that The Hunger Games was a decent book.  Clearly dumbed-down stuff, but ok as far as that goes.  The book doesn't try to be anything else.<br /><br />So it was with a certain degree of trepidation that I decided to read Catching Fire.  I chose the book partly because I was getting bored of other things and partly because I was able to check it out for free on my Kindle.  Plus, The Hunger Games movie is out and I figured what the heck... I haven't read anything else good lately, so what harm can it do to read this?<br /><br />Summary - Sappy teen girl drama.<br /><br />The love story is pathetic and typical.  16 (or is she 17?) year old girl loves two boys... and both boys love her... but she can only have one, etc, etc.  Gale, the childhood friend who she loves.  Peeta, the boy she also loves, but doesn't want to admit it because she is forced to love him... but is its real?  Or is it a charade?  Or do I really love him?  Or is it a charade?  Oh... what about my feelings for Gale?  I love him too!  Oh my - what will I do!<br /><br />Blah... Blah... Blah.  What's up with the obsession of teen girls caught between two men?  DP?<br /><br />You want this book in a nutshell - It reads like the journal of a teenager.  Here you go.  On page 125, Katniss thinks to herself, \\"...I love Gale...What do I mean when I say I love Gale?  I don't know.  I did kiss him last night, in a moment when my emotions were running so high.  But I'm sure he doesn't remember it.  Does he?  I hope not.  If he does, everything will just get more complicated and I really can't think about kissing when I've got a rebellion to incite.\\"<br /><br />Ohhhhhh the drama!  Whatever will she do!  The only way it could get more sappy would be if we suddenly found out that Gale was a dark and mysterious teen vampire... or maybe a werewolf.... Oh wait, that story is already taken...<br /><br />Love triangle drama aside, the book takes a 180 degree turn half way through in an attempt to re-harsh The Hunger Games again.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the author herself is entirely vested in the idea -its more like she just needed to get through this stuff and get on to book three.<br /><br />I also found the final plot twist to be ridiculous.  The tributes had this elaborate plot to blow the force field and escape the games... but decided not to tell Katniss of the plan.  Uhhhhhh...ok.... So what if Katniss had killed off the people who were crucial to the plan?  What then?  Seeing as how the goal of everyone in the games is to kill each other, you would think that Katniss would actually need to know about the plan - especially considering how handy she is with bow.  Opps!  Shot and killed Volt!  What's that?  He was part of a big plan to escape the games?  Sorry - wish you would have told me about that before I shot him!<br /><br />Anyone giving this book 5 stars is a hack.  The Hunger Games is a \\"better\\" book - however you want to define it.  That isn't debatable.  If you love both books, you would still have to admit that The Hunger Games was \\"better\\".  If you hate both books, you would have to say that The Hunger Games at least not as bad as Catching Fire.  The bigger the fan, the more discerning you should be.  A true fan would make a distinction.  Do Star Wars fans rate all Star Wars movies 5 stars?  Heck no... it would be stupid and demonstrate that you have no idea what you are taking about.  Empire Strikes Back, 5 stars.  Return of the Jedi, probably 3 stars.  A New Hope, give it 5 if you credit it as the first movie... otherwise 4 because Empire Strikes Back was better.<br /><br />Same with this series.  5 stars doesn't reflect on the greatness of the book, it simply shows that you have no perspective.  No matter the context in which one rates this book, you would, at the very least, have to compare it against the series itself.  Therefore, no 5 star rating.  Period.<br /><br />\\"But Moondonkey... can't the books be equal?\\" you ask.<br /><br />No.They can't.  No.  They aren't.  Now go back to watching iCarly and Victorious and stop with the nonsense.<br /><br />If memory serves, I gave The Hunger Games 4 stars.  So why 2 for Catching Fire?  Because 3 would be an \\"average\\" book in general.  3 isn't necessarily bad... it is solid... middle of the road... average.  Is Catching Fire that?  No.They can't.  No.  They aren't.  Now go back to watching iCarly and Victorious and stop with the nonsense.<br /><br />If memory serves, I gave The Hunger Games 4 stars.  So why 2 for Catching Fire?  Because 3 would be an \\"average\\" book in general.  3 isn't necessarily bad... it is solid... middle of the road... average.  Is Catching Fire that?  No.
B003JTHXOK|5|I love the book and I'd read it again. She left an abusive marriage and found happiness and finally found a man who truly loved her.
B0034DGPEU|4|At times this book was difficult to read and nearly as difficult to put down.  It's a raw slap of the reality of slavery when perfectly nice white people acted shamefully.  Great read!  J Rose
B00FRQ32N4|2|There were so many advertisements I could not play the game. And when I reloaded it went to a black screen for so long that I gave up
B008TMA1LY|5|this game is AWESOME..... i have always loved hello kitty and this game is fun, easy and addictive. it reminds me of diner dash

B0002X314C|4|I'm quite impressed with this album. After two complete listens I have yet to feel a weak cut. This album will definitely receive a lot of play in my car and ipod. My only complaint is that Legend sounds way too much like Carl Thomas. Not only does he sound like Thomas in vocal tone, but he croons like him as well, which doesn't say much for being original. However, this is not to say that Legend doesn't have his own appeal. In fact, this album is much better than Carl's last album. Kanye West produced about half of the 13 selections with some of his best tracks to date.
B001UTW7QU|5|fantasticaly addictive
B000VI04HK|5|This has been one of the best purchases Ive done. You get in love with REM. I really recomend it!!!
B007SYWFRM|4|good game to play. my granddaughter. enjoys playing it with me and she can play it by herself.it really keeps her occupied. tiger graphics are great!
B0086700CM|3|Temple run is okay. I mean sometimes it freezes for a couple minutes and then just goes back to the kindle homepage. Also, I really think they could of made it a bit more interesting as well instead of just making it go on and on.
B006MW3UZW|5|Just catching up before new season starts.  We stream TV and I have to wait until it's offered (bummer)
B005HV6Y84|5|As so many people have said, you don't have to be a Twilight fan to enjoy the soundtracks. I have all four and have been introduced to so many more artists and music that I probably never would have listened to. Music lovers won't be disappointed by this or any of the other Twilight soundtracks.
B0018OFN1S|5|We were re-watching the series so we were all refreshed to see Furious 7.<br />Good to revisit some of the old story lines.<br />It doesn't disappoint.
0783225857|5|There are not too many film versions of novels which \\"match-up\\" to the original in print. This one does a particularly excellent job. It \\"fleshed out\\" the characters of Atticus, Scout, Gem and others for me and it did, to me, portray the main storyline: the picture of a father's relations with his children, the community at large as well as contemporary societal issues.
B004GYNPL2|5|Highly recommend
B00004R9A4|5|Bedknobs and Broomsticks is my favorite Disney movie ever created. However, it is also one of the most overlooked ones as well. I've watched this movie since I was a little child, and you never get bored of it. One childhood memory I have, is watching this movie with my family. Now, I watch this 30th Anniversary DVD with my baby brother. Now I'll tell you all what this classic is about.<br />Bedknobs and Broomsticks is about a middle aged apprentice witch named Eglantine Price who lives in 1940 England. She is ordered to watch after 3 children who have been evacuated from London. The kids find out Miss Price's secret, and they also find out that Miss Price learns witchcraft from a mailorder course. To make a pact that states that if they keep her secret, she'll make it worth her while. So, she enchants a brass bedknob that will make them go wherever they want. However, the school closes, without the most important final spell, the Subsitutiary Locomotion spell. <br />So, using the bedknob, they go to London and seek out the headmaster of the school, Emelius Brown. Mr Brown can't find the spell either because the book he got out the spell of is torn, and the spell is only found on a necklace of a sorcerer named Astoroth.<br />Anyway, they go to Portobello Road, like a mini mall, and learn that towards the end of Astoroth's life, he captured animals and kept them in cages to make them more human like. The animals rebelled and killed Astoroth and stole the necklace. The animals escaped and took refuge on a mythical Isle named Niboombu.<br />The animation starts know as the tiny group explore the sea and then the island using hte traveling bedknob, and get the necklace that has the spell on it after a fun soccer game with a lion, which almost ends our story. After getting the necklace and returning home, the Nazi soldiers attack, and using the Spell, Miss Price and Company defeat them.<br />Now, I highly reccomend this DVD because of its digitally restored and digitallyremastered format, and the resolution is so clear. This also has one of the best climaxes in Disney history, when they fight the Nazi's, and also has great animation.<br />As Mr Brown says, \\"Do it with a Flair\\", and get this 30th anniversary DVD, Digitally Restored and Remastered and Ready to Go!
B006IYG5HE|4|between 4 -5 stars; fun, light reading.
B005J4TLO8|5|Funniest movie EVER!!!!!
B00005JOFQ|5|This superb and superlative movie is one of the saddest and most uplifting I have seen in a very, very long time. The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time.  <br /> <br />I saw the first matinee of Brokeback Mountain here in Ottawa, Canada and at the end there was much sobbing and wimpering - mostly from the WOMEN in the audience. That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions. For that reason I believe the Academy Award for Best Picture was stolen from Brokeback Mountain because of the hidden homophobia still present in Hollywood, of all places!! There must be more gays and lesbians per capita there than any other place on earth but it is the producers and the power elite who ultimately decide - in their own minds only - what is palatable and acceptable for the American \\"unwashed\\". We must not forget the \\"casting couch\\" and the crypto-fags who produce and cast movies but are married with children yet still DEMAND sexual favours of all persuasions and perversions from aspiring AND established actors in order for them to get the parts.  <br /> <br />As a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations. The rise in the tourist trade from the US of A must have skyrocketed after Americans realised the natural splendours  <br />existing north of our common border.  <br /> <br />The acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding. Ledger carries the movie with his anguished non-communicativeness and the scene at the end with Jake's family will tug at your heart and your mind. Ledger's subdued and stylish acting there and at the very end is one of the best performances by an actor I have seen in a very long time. HE should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Actor but then Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of TrumanCapote was very tough competition indeed. It is too bad there was not a tie vote because they both demonstrated their consummate mastery of the art of acting.  <br /> <br />The female stars are also very good and since this is basically a family movie about love, longing, and lust their presence is essential.  <br /> <br />Every aficianado of fine cinema should run out to get this DVD and you don't have to be gay to appreciate its qualities. It is a movie for everyone and speaks universal messages.  <br /> <br />Very, very highly recommended for ALL sexual persuasions.  <br /> <br />TIMOTHY WINGATE Ottawa CANADA
B005OT2YVA|3|The movie was good, special effect awesome as usual, but the movie as a whole was kinda reaching. Guess they just needed to make make money after they paid for the licensing.
B00BC5I6Q2|5|good series.  season 1 is very addictive, you will want to watch this one more than once. Get the dvds
B005USZML4|4|My son chose this book as his independent reading book for middle  school.  He really enjoyed it. Highly recommend students to read,
B008JGSM6G|5|Enjoy playing this game! It is challenging and fun especially you play the time trial. I enjoy playing through the levels without being timed as well.
B000HWZ4CA|5|We thought the tape was in excellent condition and the delivery service was very efficient.
B00001QGPS|3|LYRICS: (3.5/5) Ya'll will probably hate me for this, but I don't think that the lyrics were all that on this album. Red and Meth have their style down so well, it seems as if they don't put as much effort into it as they  used to. It's like they just went through the motions with this albums.  Plus the hooks were pretty weak.<br />BEATS: (3/5) Ever since the Def Squad  album, Erick's beats have been sounding to similar. Not many of them stand  out as fresh. He needs to dip back into that style he used on Dare Iz A  Darkside, or Double Or Nothing. None of the beats are wack, but none of  them stand out either. Similar to the lyrics, it seems like Erick is just  going through the motions with the beats too, and not pushing himself to  expand and be more creative.<br />OVERALL: (3/5) The album kinda sounded like  a continuation of Doc's Da Name album, just this time, including Meth. It's  an enjoyable album, but it doesn't have enough spectacular material to  stand out. Plus, do we really need to include &quot;How High&quot;,  &quot;Big Dogs&quot; or &quot;All Rite Cha&quot;, all of which are already  their solo albums. They also lose points for having wackest rapper of the  year, Ja Rule on the album. Suprisingly, LL Cool J dropped a better verse  than him. LOL.
B001ANSSDC|5|This was an amazing book. I truly loved it! I would recommend this book to everyone I know. Beautifully written.

0312979479|5|If you like/love Agatha Christie and even if you don't, this is one book you can not miss! Of all the Agatha Christie books I've read, this is her at her finest. it is so intense and a page turner that you will not want to put it down for anything! This really is a gem of a book. Read it now!
B0094BB4TW|3|I don't use Facebook. My wife uses it a lot, but usually uses it on our pc or her smartphone, so she likes it what little she's used it.
B001BANK32|5|I haven't read this since it came out years ago. I wanted to re-read it before I read Doctor Sleep. I didn't remember some of the parts, so it was a good read. This novel was well written, kept my interest, and it was hard to put down. I always get absorbed in Stephen King 's novels; I love novels that I get so involved in. I look forward to starting the sequel.
B0055SWM08|5|very fun and relaxing. Love the music would definately purchase more like. this. always anxious to see what the next level brings.this is all I have to say about this game
B00QW8TYWO|5|Crossy Road is possibly the simplest game ever- but also possibly the most fun. The only thing I wish is that you could get all of the characters from the prize machine. Each character has its own funny attribute- the Unihorse has a trail of rainbows following it. Crossy Road is a very fun game.
B0052UZIFA|4|Before the update, I had problem with the game freezing, closing, and loosing game saves. I am on the galaxy nexus. now the game works great. I am about half way through an I have not had one issue. The only complaint I have is this does not have all the extra game play modes and mini games as the IOS version.
B00NJT3A5Q|5|Perfect for the holidays
B00FZRMIYY|5|There's some very warm, experience-laden music on this CD.  And it's the best I've heard from Roseanne in a very long time.  Her voice is far better than I expected from a lady who's had a rough life and been singing through it all for 40+ years.  The booklet makes it a real collector's item too.
B000066NW0|1|Like, Avril is, like, totally, like the bestest!  She, like, writes her, like, own songs and can, like, play one note on a guitar thingy.  She's, like, totally, like kewl and sooo punk and, like, she like does like her own thing.  Avril rox!
B00ACBN9CI|5|Currently flying the F15C with moderate success.  I have yet to discover the secret to out maneuvering the hoard of MIGs trying to shoot me down.  They always seem to be able to turn quicker and gain the firing advantage over me.  I'm always at a disadvantage numerically , usually outnumbered 6 to 1, and by the enemy always having the altitude advantage.  If I try to climb too quickly in afterburner I can easily stall and become easy pickings due to my low speed and unresponsive controls.  I really wish there was an artificial horizon instrument so I could see my pitch in a climb.<br /><br />Despite these challenges I can usually score 3 - 5 kills on a mission, mostly with the air to air missiles.  The 30 mm cannon is only good for a head on pass as it is just too hard to maneuver into a satisfactory position for a gun solution.  After exhausting the meager supply of decoys it is a challenge to put the F15 through its paces to avoid being blown out of the sky.  If I manage to get out alive it is a cause for great celebration no matter my score!

B00005JGAB|5|It's hard to improve on perfection, but that's just what the visionaries over at Rhino have done with this remastered, expanded version of the Ramones eponymous debut album, an album that in its original version, shook the very foundations of rock and roll and brought it to its knees.  Although reportedly in the works long before the death of Joey Ramone, it's hard not to look at this and the rest of the Ramones re-issues as anything but a tribute to his and the rest of the band's genius.  Contains eight bonus tracks, including three demos (&quot;I Don't Care,&quot; &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue,&quot; and &quot;You Should Never Have Opened That Door&quot;) previously unavailable anywhere, two only available on &quot;All The Stuff (And More), Volume One,&quot; two previously available on a Norton vinyl single, and the single version of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop.&quot;  The overall sound of the original album is cleaned up a little, but is still raw enough to satisfy purists.  Should be required listening in junior high schools nation-wide...

B00884GR0W|5|A tip if you get stuck, on their homepage there is a chat function where you can ask for advice.  Very helpful and friendly.
B006LSZECO|4|This book had all the right elements to keep you reading and interested.  I would definitely recommend this book yo my book club friends.

B00BAVCD8A|3|Whenever I heard that Fall Out Boy was making A new CD, I was falling all over myself just to get an order placed for it. I've always been a pretty big fan, and liked all their previous material. Not to say I don't like this album, but its just not as good as the older material. I liked about 6 of The songs out of the whole thing. So on scale of 1-10, I'd give a 7.
B007ZXK08C|5|The best thriller I've read all year!  It was so good I went online and bought her first book which I'm currently readying (and loving too).

B002MQYOFW|5|This book is wonderful, unfortunately I saw the movie first, and am now dissapointed in the movie due to changes that they made in the movie, but on the other hand this was a great read.

B00EMXBDMA|5|This is a &#34;space-literate&#34; novel which will appeal to those who know the history of our space program, and how NASA got us to the moon. The author draws on the myth of Apollo and its astronauts in telling his story. In addition, he packs the story with science, so I always felt I was getting a realistic story of what it may be like to be on Mars. Finally, the humor &#34;made&#34; this tale. There was always an understated feeling to the main character's narration, and the interplay between those on the ground, and his fellow crew members, made it a human story.
B007ZGO7EM|4|Glad to have this on my kindle. Sometimes I need to balance my checkbook or when there is a sale and I need to know how much % is off an item.
B00003CXI1|3|The movie of the first Harry Potter book is worthy of the time and money to watch it, but it lacks in one essential element; the characters don't seem to believe in the reality of their world as much as I.  Hermione never looks around the Great Hall when she first walks in; when he comes to pick him up from the island, Haggrid acts like it has been a few days since he last saw Harry, not many years.  There are many such examples.<br /> I am glad for any and all attention the movies generates for the books, however.  Ms. Rowling works deserve all the attention they get. Seek them.  THERE lies a real adventure in reading.
B007FG9LIE|5|Exciting from start to finish!
B00AIBZMD6|4|As a former Marine Corps infantry officer and also a former CIA clandestine operations officer, one of the first to chase terrorists full time (in the 1980's), I found the movie engaging but annoying. The producers obviously did not think enough of the USMC or the CIA to actually have a consultant able to catch the many small and some large mistakes in procedure (weapons on a helicopter are supposed to be muzzle down, always) and tradecraft.<br /><br />There are so many excellent reviews, this review is primarily to add the DVD to my existing list of reviews of DVDs for people who share my love of non-fiction but also like to enjoy serious DVDs with a few blantantly unrealistic DVDs thrown in when it suits me. To see all 135 reviews, each linked to its Amazon home page (139 after I post the four reviews from movies watching on Virgin Atlantic yesterday), visit Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, at the very bottom of the right-hand column, see Reviews (DVD Only) (139) .<br /><br />Kevin Costner is a given as a fine actor, the two new protagonists were excellent.  While Alec Baldwin set the gold standard for an analyst taking on operational responsibilities in [[ASIN:B000IDADAG The Hunt for Red October]], the male and female leads here have enormous potential and I hope they get material -- and proper consulting on authenticity -- for future productions.<br /><br />The best spy movies remain those based on John Le Carre's George Smiley series, including:<br />[[ASIN:B00007LV9M Smiley's People]]<br />[[ASIN:B005DXCO94 TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY (RE-PACKAGE)]]<br /><br />If you are interested in the craft of OLD intelligence, consider my 300+ Amazon reviews linked from an easily found online list, Worth a Look: Book Reviews on Government Secret Intelligence. The new craft of intelligence, personal, public, and political, can be explored through various briefings, chapters, and posts at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog.<br /><br />The one interesting element of the plot was the idea of riding the electrical power lines into a computer.  Most now know that Best Buy sells a kit that allows a router to be connected to the electrical supply via a socket at one level, and then on another level, a virtual ethernet extension comes out.  What most do not know is that the Chinese have been doing this to NSA and the US military (e.g. NORAD) for over a decade, and this is the \\"fog fact\\" (see [[ASIN:1560258861 Fog Facts: Searching for Truth in the Land of Spin]]) that NSA is keeping from our rather retarded and corrupt Congress.<br /><br />There is way too much about the film that is just flat out unrealistic, it crosses way over into a Tom Cruise fictional genre for my taste, but it held my attention and I would like very much to see these stars go forward.

B00AOCLWF6|5|Falling Skies is a well rounded solid show. Something I respected about this season was the producers were able to keep the content relatively clean - allowing the show to focus on content rather than inappropriate scenes.
B0036BK6MW|5|great movie.  so worth watching
B0058OUJA4|5|Unlike the &#34;Zombie Tower&#34; game for iOS, this doesn't have those high end graphics but is basically the same concept. Makes it easier to play as a break from work for a short time without having to do much. Just love it!
B000JJS8TM|5|This album reinforces the true genius of John, Paul, George and Ringo.  It also reinforces how much George Martin brought to the table and molded the original songs into classics, and what genius Giles Martin is in the studio as well. The fact that the tempos, chord patterns, and melodies can be layered and segued without the music being altered in a detectable way is almost mystical that it could be done and magical that it has been done. This whole album is like finding a new hidden story in the hyroglyphics inside one of the pyramids that we've been studying for hundreds of years.  <br /> <br />How does the same vocal track for the original \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" which rocks, transcend into a guitar and vocal intimate ballad as presented here without being re-recorded? \\"Mr. Kite\\" morphing into \\"She's So Heavy\\" is so great you have to laugh! <br /> <br />The 5.1 mix of this album could be the ultimate demonstration tool to wow anyone with your home theater setup.
B00004Z4WR|2|The Sticky doesn't really understand this movie.  I mean what's the point in stealing all those bags of rice? You can just get them at your local supermarket.
B00001OH7V|5|Although a grand creative statement that has more than withstood the test of time (and musical writers),[[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]] was not the success at the time on any level that it deserved to be. Along with contemporary Iggy Pop (who sang back-up on the previous album),Bowie journeyed with producer Brian Eno back to Berlin to record the follow up album later the same year. 1977 in general was an extremely transitional year for music. With the disco-dance culture taking off in many unique ways around the world,the European trend in dance music was for a very synthesizer based electronic variety of the music that was extremely futurist in orientation. You could here them in the work of the French producer/artist Cerrone as well as Munich's own Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellote. In the meantime,Bowie's own sound was taking a mixture of electronics and guitar to another whole direction with Brian Eno. So it was likely these two separate but equal musical intersections were going to meet on some kind of interesting musical ground for this album. Not only did this happen,but exceeded even what Bowie had done on his first collaborative effort with Eno.<br /><br />  \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" and \\"Joe The Lion\\" are two extremely powerful songs-the first beginning with the sound of the tape machine being turned on and leading into this perfect blend of a past paced dance beat with both a heavy rocking lead guitar solo and the rhythmic patterns of Carlos Alomar and bassist George Murray creating this extremely funky underpinning. Apparently by recording Bowie's vocals on a successive series of mics at difference distances from himself,the title song was a hugely dynamic melodic rocker with high pitched guitar sonic's and icy sheets of sound. Its one of Bowie's most iconic hits and one of my favorite songs of his. \\"Blackout\\" is another powerful dance number,this time more on the chunkier funk side of rock whereas \\"V-2 Schneider\\" is an instrumentally busy,melodically cinematic uptempo rocker. \\"Sense Of Doubt\\" and \\"Moss Garden are far more crafted melodically than any of the cinematically inclined ambient electronic instrumentals on the previous album-showcasing that Bowie and Eno had continued to improve on that end of their sound at this point. \\"Neuklon\\" is my personal favorite of these numbers-Bowie himself beautifully playing the Koto on a complete blend of Arabic and Asian modalities and rhythms. \\"The Secret Life Of Arabia\\" is another of my favorites here-a sleek dancefloor friendly pop/funk rock groove with another strong melody and wonderful rhythm.<br /><br />  Each of Bowie's Berlin era collaborations with Brian Eno have their own unique flavors to them. This particular album succeeded commercially likely because the musical ideas that came out of the collaboration originally are much more clearly defined. This is very much a dance/rock/funk hybrid with a strong electronic/synthesizer flavor about it. As a matter of fact,this album has grown so iconic that its cover art was comically used as the template for Bowie's latest (and very surprising) album [[ASIN:B00AYHKIZ6 The Next Day]]. Groups such as Talking Heads and Public Image Ltd. would soon be heavily exploring territories that were first pioneered on albums like this. Dealing with the music of Bowie/Eno at this point in their collaboration was somewhat like an amateur chess player in a professional tournament: they always seem to be two steps ahead of the musical game. Not only that but the fact that the musicians were top notch and Bowie's ingenious song craftsmanship and deep artistic influences abound throughout every pour of this album. On an even deeper level,those with enormous intellectual knowledge of music could do major critical pieces on this album outside the defined pop music world. As with its predecessor,this is one of those albums that just has a tremendous musical influence on every successive generation of serious musician who hears it. So,with all of that saidthis album still comes highly recommended to any admirer of David Bowie,Brian Eno or for that matter any popular music of the last half century.this album still comes highly recommended to any admirer of David Bowie,Brian Eno or for that matter any popular music of the last half century.
B00846REIS|5|I had read the \\"Grey\\" books prior to reading this book. At first it gives you oh this is basically the same. But keep reading!!! I found that I actually enjoyed this book more. I felt it was better written and just a better story. If your reading this and have not read the grey books and find at the end you need a little more kink the grey books should be your next read.
B002WLTI62|5|Amazing vocals, in English and Spanish, Great dance music!<br />These are some of my favorite dance tracks of all time. Its a must for dancers and people who love Good music!

B00EE3FVSU|5|I'd like to use this review to give a shout-out to Jodie Whittaker.  Olivia Colman won the BAFTA, but I think Whittaker was even better as the grieving mother.  Well......whatever.  This show is so good it's a must-see from any perspective.

B00V4RGWNW|5|Blurryface is like their first album that has more of &#34;bass&#34; sound and good production. Though not as great as Vessel, it's still a very very good work maintaining their sound and it definitely tops a lot of crappy new albums today.
B007FEFLTO|5|I read this book not for a history lesson. All that aside I still gained some insight and a lot of interest in that era. These strong dynamic characters who survived such hellish existence, survived on the hope to build a world where their children would never know that kind of suffering. The whole world should read this book. Then buy a dictionary and learn the meanings of words such as ( integrity, respect, morality, compassion, honor, and most importantly LOSS). If you can read this and not be moved emotionally, you do not know those words.
0425166805|4|Von Daniken raises many interesting questions about the possibility of extraterrestrial visitors to Earth.  Although it is not particularly well written, if you are at all interested in his hypothesis, the book makes for very exciting reading.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This is an indispensable product that I use everyday. You cannot beat the price to performance ratio. I have 2.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I didn't expect so much fun from a free game but it's easy to get involved with this one. A great way to pass the time and exercise your brain cells. I highly recommend these types of games. I would have given 5 stars but I disagree with the whole concept of in app purchases. Still, this game is really fun to play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Love that all seasons available & appreciate bring able to see them all at once sequentially without losing the stories continuity.
B002WCLG3O|1|Weak or non-existent stories, atrocious graphics for the most part - either badly-drawn or way over-shaded - truly disappointing.    Anime should have been the perfect medium for this but, as a collection, this is a failure. The last segment is very good but as a collection this doesn't merit more than one star.
B0033B5XCS|4|Good collection! Very good quality as well. A big fan of Wes Craven and Freddy Kruger! If you like the the first nightmare on elm street take a look at this collection. Although I wasn't that impressed with the last movie (freddy vs. jason) I give that one a thumbs down but the set is still worth it. 7 out of 8 movies not bad!
B00OKYQZDI|5|I really enjoy playing this game
B005GFPZYK|5|The book was good...I can watch the movie now!
B002MQYOFW|5|I was afraid to read this,but ended up loving it.  I kept reading every spare moment.  I plan on reading the next book in this series.
B005MYEQ4U|4|For many years, I seriously disliked Woody Allen's films and refused to see them. I am no longer sure how (or who) I got talked into seeing this one (maybe a curiosity about Owen Wilson starring in an Allen film?) but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fun, and for Allen, delightful. I doubt that Midnight in Paris will ever be considered within the realm of movie greats, but for sheer entertainment, something that could create a smile, this movie satisfies. The acting was good, and the stars were well-placed for their roles.

B005ZOBNOI|4|this book is about young people living with cancer and it's effects on their families and their young lives.  it's a good book that reads like a rollercoaster ride of emotions- happy, sad, funny- it's got it all!  can't wait to check out some of this authors other youth-inspired yet less depressing books.
031603438X|4|Keith Richards' Life boils down to four things: music, drugs, M/F relationships and Mick.  And if you're talking just music, this is really a five-star book.<br /><br />I'm not a musician, so to me, everything that these guys do on stage or on record is magic. If someone said \\"I'll teach you everything there is to know about this,\\" I would be sort of mistrustful.  But Richards gives you nice, detailed fascination explanations of open tuning, using castles as recording studios, writing riffs, etc. then says, \\"I really don't know how this happens.\\"  He is still a rabid follower of music and musicians, especially Chicago Blues, and when he's discussing these things he has a reverence that's indescribably wonderful.  Really, truly, I've never read a rock star bio that's this devoted to the craft.<br /><br />The negatives are probably points where Richards brushes me the wrong way.  He's way too self-congratulatory, a little transparent about his disdain for Mick. His understanding of women is pretty shallow. I imagine if he were in a car with me, I'd get annoyed...<br /><br />UNTIL we put on Jimmy Reed (on a 45 phonograph in a car.  Really?  They had those?  Friggin' awesome!)  And then it'd be heaven.  And really, all the droning parts of this book lead back to the music within a few pages, so it was a delightful read, on the whole.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Candy crush is a lot of fun and best game yet to be able to get the best way to be able to play is mind boggling

I'm just saying:)

B000002TYX|3|The Beatles' Anthologies are meant for those fans that have an interest in  the band members' personalities and history, and not for those that enjoy  the Beatles on an music-only level. So if you're a fan, the kind that  enjoys reading books and watching tv specials about the band, then this'll  be a fun buy. <br />The music here is neither exceptional nor poor, so it  should be a decent listen. In order to get the most out of it though, you  should already have a good knowledge of the band and their studio  recordings. Seeing the variations in already-familiar tunes is the real  fun. So the Anthologies should be for fans only. I would recommend picking  up one of the more enjoyable and revealing 2nd or 3rd Anthologies if you're  on the fence on this one, and choosing from there.<br />One final note, unlike  the other two Anthologies, Anthology 1 covers a period where studio  experimentation was at a minimum, so there isn't as much insight into how  songs were being structured together. And the interview and live clips are  fun extras, but they're just not nearly as interesting as the stuff from  the next two Anthologies.
0446677450|5|Before reading Rich Dad Poor Dad I was out of control, letting brokers make my financial decisions for me and letting my employer determine my lifestyle.<br />What I got out of Rich Dad Poor Dad first of all is to think for myself. No broker, financial planner or advisor will take care of my money as well as I will. Point of fact, I once turned over a sizeable amount to a broker and asked him to watch it for me. He must still be watching it because I never saw it again.<br />Employers determine how much we make, when and where were can go on vacation. We work 9-5 and at the end of the week, our employer who has us on a chain, loosens that chain let's us have a little freedom. Once a year (or more depending on how long you have worked for them) your employer reels out that line a little more for something called a vacation. Our employer even determines what kind of retirement or even if we can retire based on pensions and 401 (k) plans all of which are determined by the employer.<br />Thanks to Rich Dad, I found a better way. I determine my own investments and have done quite well thank you. I have started my own super successful business and set up my own retirement plan. I am in control. I also think for myself, something that Kiyosaki learned from his Rich Dad.<br />I used to read certain financial magazines but stopped when I realized that most were just cataloques for certain financial companies and offered very little useable advice. I lost a bundle buying a stock recommended by my broker because it was in (.....) magazine. <br />To sum up Rich Dad Poor Dad, it is the true story of Robert Kiyosaki and his real father who was poor following pretty much the same system that most people do; go to school, get a job etc. and his &quot;Rich Dad&quot;, actually a friends dad who was rich  <BR>but followed a different system, of being an entrepneneur, independent.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is a excellent book to launch you into financial self reliance. It sure worked forme.

1932100660|5|The information in this book was ,it seems, the foundation for much of the work done by dr fuhrman,and dr Esselstyn and Dr Cornish.  Dr Esselstyn has done astounding work at the Cleveland clinic showing incredible results working with very diseased individuals. His major finding has been that a plant based diet can reverse the health of very diseased individuals provided they restrict their diets to plant based foods.  Everyone of his patients had a total reversal of their health provided they stayed on a plant based diet. Those that went off the diet had serious health complications soon after their decisions not to continue with their<br />Plant based diets.  Dr Furhman has a web cite that testifies very similar findings as does Dr Esselstyn and dr Cornish!  Dr Fuhrman has a much larger client than any of the other Doctors. He sees about 5000 patients per year and the results are quite<br />Astounding !  Check them out Drfuhrman.com.<br /><br />How can anyone refute the vast number of individuals who all attest to incredible changes to their health?<br />I do not know one person who has gone onto this diet and has not lost considerable weight, felt a lot more energetic,<br />And have seen their cholesterol,blood pressure  and blood sugat make significant progress !<br /><br />MY wife and I have been on this diet for 3 months and have found our health and energy levels to be significantly better.All my family and friends that I have given the program to have likewise found very similar results !<br /><br />Dr fuhrman contends alon with Dr Cambell and Dr Esselton that Heart DISEASE,Diabetes,,Stokes and Cancer can be cured by<br />Going to a Plant based diet!  The only way to refute this statement is for some individual to show someone who has followed this diet for over a year and after that period of time come down with one of these major diseases !  So far I have not seen anyone making that claim !  By the way Dr Fuhrman. Contends it is diet and exercise. Eating is just not enough ! Diet with exercise will give incredible results !
B002QE3CTY|4|Read it because i loved the movie, but the book is quite a bit different. Although i do think its much better and definitely worth the money. Cant wait to start book 2.
B00005LOUQ|2|The visuals were wonderful but the whole film lacked any spirit.  It was a very paint by numbers movie.  Lacks any joy or heart.
B00E8KLWB4|4|There`s a lot of content which is nice. It also adds some different puzzles. I like that. It keeps it from getting stale.
B00IIUATDM|2|Alright movie. Didn't live up to the hype.
B007J4T2G8|3|i heard all the hype about the book so had to read it was really not my type of story i was alittle dissapointed
B001NLKT60|5|Very well written thriller with good pace. A real page turner. An easy read great for even for casual readers.
B007TKT2SK|4|I love the way technology gets more advanced.  This will definitely help to check the answers when my daughter gets older to do harder fractions.
B0000AQS0F|5|This series is great.  I'm not really sure why this was so poorly marketed, but the concept is fun, and the story is also a lot of fun.  The acting is very believable.  I found myself wishing that they had made more of this series.
1451697384|4|This otherwise splendid book fails to mention that the American birth rate exceeds the death rate by about 60 percent (similar for Canada) thus nullifying per capita emissions reductions.<br /><br />A Stop-at-One [child] pledge campaign across school and college campuses is a tool within the grasp of ordinary people that could raise climate awareness and send a strong sustainablity anti-growth message to the corporate world. The climate legacy of the birth of a single American child is on average 9,000 metric tons (Global Environmental Change 2009 19:14-20).<br /><br />Certainly it can be argued that population size will eventually stabilize on its own, but we are told that climate action is urgent.

This is my first time purchasing from Amazon so it is quite upset to see these tears. If I'm staying in the states, I would want to seek for an exchange and since I'm staying overseas, it would not be cost effective for me to do.

Two thumbs UP!
B00003XAQ5|4|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is one of the all-time great jazz recordings so I was eager to get this on SACD. My other Super Audio discs absolutely blew me away so I was expecting this recording to do the same. Not only was the SACD sound far richer than found in regular CDs but the spacing of the musicians was so pronounced as to make it seem like you were in the studio or club listening to the performance. Alas, I did not get that same experience with this recording. The only discernable difference between this disc and its lesser-priced cousin is a marked fullness. If you want to upgrade your jazz library, there are far worthier products in which to invest your money.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Nice game. A lot of challenges.
B0069G5Z9K|5|Great!
B00DR0PDNE|5|It was as well as i wanted ,good working and it is much more useful for me
B009HELT3C|2|The story had a good idea, but it didn't follow through. I think it has the same problem as Terminator 3,4,5,etc... It is a new movie, but nothing new is really happening...save the world from the evil bad guy. I just thought the characters(good/evil)  weren't set up to make you root for or against them.
B003E8P9G0|5|This book is very enticing and exciting the whole way. I couldn't put it down. I would say it was worth every penny.
B001FVV2X2|5|This is a strange, but thoroughly entertaining show. An unpredictable, wild ride from start to finish. I love it!<br /><br />Julie Foltz
B000000OSG|5|Greetings again..<br />..it was all the way back in 1992 when I first heard the track 'Knockin' On Heaven's Door'.. ..I never knew that I would become a core fan of this band back then.. ..and today, still longing for Izzy  Stradlin's good lyrics and reunion with the band..I just couldn't stop  listening to Axl's vocals and Slash's frettings..<br />..as a matter of fact,  I gave away a number of cassettes and a CD (of this band) which I bought  several times to friends and cousins, and ended up in buying new ones  again, instead..still look and sound good..<br />..well, 'Don't Cry',  'Estranged' and 'Knockin' On Heaven's Door' have become my usual jam  numbers and singing sessions for fun..and to make things better, Geffen  Records even have released a VCD collection of GNR's memorable hits..all  music videos that have been shot for the last couple of years...<br />I hope  this album could use up all your illusions to explore the real you,  physical and mental capabilities..and emotions. It would also definitely  help all new comers to guitars to play along all the easy chords that  follow each and every catchy tunes in this album.
B00GEEB730|5|My sister and I listened to this book from Audible and I am now reading his other book.  Such a sweet, well written story of despair and hope.Having just lost a husband less than a year ago, I can certainly relate to his sorrow and feelings of worthlessness - being old and useless.  What a blessing this book as been to me.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Very cute game with your favorite Minions! Fun bonus moves and interesting runs. Glad to find it on the Amazon App Store.
1594746036|5|It's true i don't read very many books, however i saw this at a target store and the cover of the book<br />interested me so i ended up buying it. I have not been dissapointed. The book starts off a little slow, however<br />about midway through it gets interesting and i've enjoyed the read quite a bit.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, i bought the paperback, it's an easy read, with enjoyable characters.
B003B02O7I|5|Super!
B00D5O7BPU|5|This is a great WW2 weapon sim but it needs more guns like the MP-40, Colt, 50.  cal, Bazooka, PPSH, Mosin Nagant, Springfield, Panzershreck, Grewer, SVT, MG 42, FG 42, and the M1 Carbine.
B00KA7JIII|5|I got this as the Free App Of The Day a little while back and only recently played it.  As other reviews have noted, this is an Escher like puzzle game.  It can be a bit challenging in places, but I found all the stages to be solvable and engrossing.  I definitely enjoyed playing through the levels over a few weeks as I would only do a level or two a day.  If you enjoy puzzle games this is definitely worth giving a shot.
B004HY86WE|4|If you like Angelina Jolie, you will love this film. They must have run her for days making this film. Lots of action.
B000PHOY0A|4|I puchased this book online and I am pretty satisfied with what I got from the distributer. The timing could be a little bit faster, although I am happy with the overall experience. Keep up the good work.
B0038BBA4I|5|Excellent music!
B00CH3DBNQ|5|Wonderful perspective from a teenager and her memoir of life living in Pakistan as a Muslim under the Taliban.  This may set your heart and mind at ease to learn more of the Muslim religion and culture and how some radicals - dictatorships create such turmoil in peaceable villages. Easy to read and a great page-turner. Although I don't believe or support everyone she admires - she is an honest and ambitious young girl who any daughter, woman can look up to. I recommend this book to both males and females, young and wise.
B008Y720JU|5|I loved the book &#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34; and while not true to the book the movie was very entertaining. Ewan McGregor was great as the professor and one wanted to believe in the premise of bringing Scottish salmon to Yemen and the peace it (fly fishing) might stand for.
B00JCW0BCY|5|As a young medical resident in Boston I am now better equipped to deal with end of life discussions after reading this book. Recommend this book to anyone whether you are in healthcare or not.
B00B2V66VS|3|Great game. better than first temple run! but on my kindle fire it lags all the time even when I'm just running it lags. if it wasn't for that it'd be a close 5 star for sure.
B009JZTOG8|3|For some reason, Season 2 left us feeling flat compared to Season 1. Maybe the concept of the show got old to us, but we stopped watching after a couple of episodes.
078689136X|5|Wonderful, met my expectations.  Kept my interest,very difficult to put down. Wonderful
B008BQ8YHQ|5|The basis premise of the series is obviously absurd (not unlike &#34;Doogie Howser&#34;) but one is still engaged by the characters created by the cast.  There is some serious acting talent involved, and the writers have taken advantage of it.
B00RNRD7Y4|4|I loved this movie! So very funny. Watched it twice. I look forward to buying the DVD. I &#60;3 North Korea.
B00475AYJQ|5|Kvothe's adventures continue at the University....and than the courts of the Maer....and is introduce to the Adem mercenaries....Kills some folks...spends some time in the fae....becomes a fighter, a lover, an arcanist...its good...900 plus pages now we know what Kvothe has been up to from age 11-17. I guess he is middle aged man in the Waystone telling his life story to chronicler....So Book three only has to cover from age 17-55? should be roughly 45,000 pages. We will see how this all wraps up.
B000059QYB|3|good
B000002LEE|5|This is the band's best disc. I disagree strongly with the Amazon review that believes the best Jane's songs are on \\"Ritual...\\" While that disc is great in its own time and space, \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" is on a different plane altogether. This band was starving in every way at that time, and this disc captures that hunger. IMHO, there isn't a less-than-great song (save for the throw away \\"thank you ,boys\\")here. \\"Summertime Rolls\\" is a forgotten classic, a tune that I'm sure every purist loves. The raw intensity, creativity, rockmanship, and independence would never again be reached by this band. They were at their paramount here, the height of their powers. If it was the only thing they'd ever done, they would be one of rock's greatest bands. Fortunately for them, they also did \\"Ritual...\\", which cements forever them in rock royalty.
B00CWY76CC|5|Great game. What a nice way to escape during lunch break. A chance to break out from the confines of the work chubby.
B006B7LQ90|5|As always you can trust Al Ries on this one. Although some of the ideas written in this book you've already knew it, it's a must for everyone who's interested in marketing.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I would have gave it 5 stars,but I can't update it.
B00005JNBQ|5|As fate would have it, I, like others before me, was not popular in school.  High school was a pretty dismal experience, and don't get me started on junior high!  Santa Maria!!!! NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE brings to the big screen the experiences and misadventures of the epitome of misfit-dom--the title character (a curly-headed, coke-bottle glasses-adorned outcast played by Jon Heder).  This guy is really like no one I have ever seen.<br /><br />Napolean  is a young man who lives with his grandmother and 32 year old brother in a small town in Idaho.  His days consist of feeding their llama, seeking out odd jobs (they include working in a chicken farm, hearding the creatures into cages and analyzing glasses of milk to determine what the cows consumed before they were milked), and just trying to survive the ups and downs (mostly downs) of high school life.  Napolean encounters fellow geek Pedro (Efren Ramirez), recently uprooted from his native Mexico, and helps him run for class president.  Napolean also encounters Deb (Tina Majorino), a shy aspiring glamor shot photographer, who becomes his friend.<br /><br />This film is filled with a kind of humor best-described as \\"off the wall\\" and \\"subtle\\" (to say the least).  In fact, when I started watching it, I really wasn't sure if it was really going to appeal to my tastes (though, I try to keep an open mind and enjoy independent films).  Some of the most well known phrases from this film have been oft-quoted in the media, as of late (\\"I caught you a nice sea bass,\\" \\"Gosh!\\" and \\"Idiot!\\").  You have to see the film to begin to understand the context.....stick with it and you will enjoy this unusual, upbeat and affirmative journey about outsiders finding solace in each other's company and realizing their own potential through self determination (and Napolean's secret weapon...of course....)
B007PTJOV0|5|My cousin recommended this game because she knew how much I loved Super Mario Bros. and I must say she was right. Love, love, love playing this game.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Sooooo much fun..
B00C8S9W0G|5|Loved it, can't wait for the next installment in this continuing sage. Diana Gabalden rocks. I read it so quickly, l'll be re-reading it soon so I can savor it.
1401937268|5|These are beautiful cards. They have the angels and the basic tarot in them. They're the cards I use to do my readings. They give you the name the card on top then a description below. The box also comes with a nice manual.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game Is awesome! I actually get mad when I lose, and it has some pretty good graphics,too! I totally would recommend this to a friend!
B008JGSM6G|5|I don't usually write reviews but this game is AWESOME! I downloaded it today and I cant stop playing it! :D
B00004XOWM|5|I think that this is the best cd limp has ever made. I'm a serious fan and love all of their cds but this one is the best. They have matured a lot in ways, yet their are still the best rock band out there. If you like limp bizkit or rock i seriously suggest this cd. Its a must buy, so go out and get it. You'll love it. Limp Bizkit rocks!
B00APUYN0I|2|It was just ok
B0086700CM|5|My little brother love this games he plays it everyday when he get home from school and love this ohter games too and palys them alot i cant get them to get off this kindle fire
B005LW5J9O|5|A must for history buffs.  It presents another and very interesting introduction to the Renaissance and a fascinating review of some of the thinkers and writers preceding Lucretius.
B000ID37RM|5|To Kill a Mockingbird is a must see for every American both because of the rich subject matters and excellent acting.  Gregory Peck is brilliant as Atticus Finch.  I watched this with my family recently and like Casablanca and a few other classic movies, it did not seem  too dated or hokey despite the age of the film.
162365999X|4|I am reticent to review books on Amazon when you all are amazing at doing so, however, this book in particular touched me as exceptional on many levels. Of course, the characters are key along with learning more about a remote culture, a historical trip that few take annually that may signify passage from young adult to manhood, learning the truth of a terrible secret, returning to a childhood home to investigate whether a crime there relates to an ongoing case elsewhere.<br /><br />I've always wondered why some books rise and some do not, is it publisher support, marketing, reviews, reviewers, gross sales, luck, all of those factors and some I have no concept of understanding without entering the fray. This book should have made it through rising to a reasonable status, it's that good.
B00992CF6W|5|I love Minecraft and now I can play on the go.
B0084I9QIW|5|What else can I say besides AMAZING! If you are a Michael Jackson fan you must get this. The Bad album is one of my favorite albums of all time so having this was a must for me. He is at his best here! Voice was on point! You won't regret it! They don't make 'em like this anymore!
B005QYKE2Y|5|Great addition to our collection!
0975991477|1|what can anyone say it is a BOOK you have no right to demand  how many words to write. because<br /><br />of that demand i usually wont write anything why do you need so many statements ITS GOOD SHOULD<br /><br />BE FINE
037571457X|5|The Key: A Fabrication of Paradise<br /><br />  Perhaps the most powerful moment in Satrapi’s novel Persepolis, occurs in Chapter 13, The Key.  Page 102 contains important and powerful images due to the visuals and the context behind both of the panels.  The Key is a horrific symbol in this story because it is an object given by the government to young boys as a form of propaganda when going to war.  The government states that any boy who holds this key and dies during battle would immediately be sent to heaven.  The whole idea behind the Key is the fact that the boys are objects that can be easily replaced after participating in the war.  This was shocking for me to discover because it showed me how little the Regime of Iran felt for their citizens, especially those who are young, innocent, and poor.  This form of propaganda is especially abhorrent because the Key is something with essentially no value whatsoever, it is simply a plastic key painted gold.  This panel contributes to Marji’s story because it helped her mature by showing her the real world and how it is a dangerous and cruel place.  The two juxtaposed panels on page 102 are significant because Satrapi uses remarkable illustrations along with differences and similarities in terms of context to the story and the appearances of the drawings.  This allows readers to fully immerse themselves into the story and truly feel affected by the powerful aspect behind the Key.<br />  The strikingly powerful combination of the two panels is brilliantly illustrated but also important because of the dramatic shift between two extremes.  The drawing style of Satrapi is impressive in the first panel because it shows a chaotic scene of faceless people who look like mere silhouettes being torn apart by explosions.  Not only does the powerful scene display a sense of death and destruction, the faceless people also have the Keys around their necks which promises them a passage to “paradise” when they die in battle.The kids also look like they are being strangled or hung by the keys from their necks with the unnatural angles and positions of the soldiers, which is interesting because it further deepens the sense of violence and death.  The details of the panel’s drawing are vivid but also blurred at the same time, which conveys the senses of chaos and confusion.  The panel seems unusual at first glance, but after looking at it more deeply the viewer will get a clear sense of what is truly happening, the destruction of innocent and poor children.  Additionally, the boys who are dying from the explosions are shown in skewered and hunched positions that further conveys the feeling of pain and agony to the reader.  The next panel deviates to a completely different tone and meaning.  It shows a scene where Marji is attending her first party she has ever been to in her life.  Additionally, her mother approved of it and made her a sweater and a beautiful necklace, which led Marji to believe that she was looking good.  Satrapi created a more simplistic drawing of a fun and amusing scene, which is the opposite of the last panel.  It simply shows Marji and her friends dancing around with facial expressions that clearly show delight and contentment, they are just having a good time.  The first panel gives a sense of destruction and death, while the second panel displays a sense of happiness and enjoyment.<br />  This page is particularly interesting because of the similarities and differences between the two seemingly opposite panels.  The first panel shows that the poor people, who are the silhouette-like shapes of people being destroyed, have no distinguishable characteristics that can identify any of them.  While in the second panel, Marji and her friends who are part of the middle class or upper middle class possess joyful and distinct facial expressions that the reader can clearly see.  These appearances show the economic differences between the two social groups.  The young soldiers dying in battle are robbed of their voices and only the economically advantaged people, like Marji, could afford to have unique identities.  Whereas the middle or upper class people are able to have fun entertainment while escaping the horrors of war, the poor people are forced to fight in the war and are useful to the Regime only by their sacrifice.  However, there are some similarities between the two panels because there are some body positions that are the same between the soldiers in the first panel and the kids in the second panel.  Like the soldiers, the bodies of the kids at the party are bent and jumping.  The fact that the body positions of the people in both panels are so similar shows both the soldiers and the kids are exploding.  The soldiers are literally exploding due to the fact that they are tragically being bombed, while the kids and especially Marji are experiencing an explosion internally, the feeling of maturity and growing up since Marji is at her first party.<br />  All in all, these significant panels demonstrate two opposite meanings that prompt readers to immerse themselves into the story’s events and its context.  The top panel resembling the scene of destruction and mayhem is brilliantly drawn and lets readers learn about the horrible events that occurred in that specific time period in Iran.  Whereas the bottom panel shifts to a scene with a polar opposite meaning of joy or amusement.  Although Marji was not completely affected by the events of the Key and the boys dying in battle, she still had to get her mind off of the war by going to the party.  Furthermore, since she was still young and naive, she truly knew that what the Regime was doing was wrong and horrible.
B00F8F3J2S|2|With all his qualifications, I expected something better<br />A waste of this man talents former Intelligence offer, President<br />of Texas A&M University could not make it interesting.
B0064X7FVE|4|Good forecast, accurate local data,
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I love this game its better than flappy bird. must get it if you haven't yet. its very addicting and awesome.
B001EYU1VO|1|Wow! I am so disappointed. The stick is the worst joystick I ever bought. The biggest problem is that after only 2 months the stick is useless. The first thing that went was the right lower button on the upper part of the stick. Next, the lower left button in the same location snapped off. Then, within a few minutes, the yaw went bad so that if you just grip the handle the yaw goes left as if twisting left. It's completely useless after only 2 months.
B000I5X81K|5|Josh Groban ... nothing more to add.  Tremendous Voice :)~
B009OYSFDM|5|I enjoyed the first couple of shows and as I continued to watch I have now become a huge fan. I find the show to have lots of action, great stunts and a great story.  I can't wait to find out more of what happened to Olivia Queen on the Island. I would highly recommend renting this series.
