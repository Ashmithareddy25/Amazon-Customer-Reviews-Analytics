B00029JMIK|5|A must for all msd or any other ignition boxes
B000CQ48LE|2|not low enough
B006VCH590|5|Great product, cleanly machined material.
B00E0OSDPQ|5|Excellent product, holds up well through whatever I throw at it!
B00RNGX024|4|Like it! Bright! Very sticky
B007IQ3CHM|3|I honestly can't tell a difference, but the are cheap. Cheap is good since they are just essentially thick plastic washers.
B00IP0L1PA|5|Good original part. Haven't had any problems with the 30 miles I have put on it so far. I would recommend because it's a cheaper price for the same quality part.
B003XINQE8|5|very nice and a lot cheaper than the dealership
B0009OMYCY|5|AAAA++++
B000JFJM14|5|With the added brake bleed kit, this has made my life MUCH easier.  This creates a lot more vacuum than the little hand pumps.  I will also us it for transmission fluid.
B0002KO3AG|5|Great.
B00KOU36L6|5|Very good works perfectly
B005FL28YU|4|Z23-945  20150301 ceramic brake pads is different (front) all rotors fits and back pads break is fit except front pads could you sent me replacement pls:
B0093PGTQM|5|Nice replacement lever. I don't want skulls or iron crosses, not my thing. If you need a stock replacement lever this is a good choice.
B00FSWHXHI|5|charges great!
B0002MSY6S|5|excellant
B0024ECIP0|5|Yes - product met all expectations at that price.  Delivery was spot on for a quit delivery.  Thanks Amazon..
B010WSMJNU|5|This bike light set is so easy to install and so important to have if your child likes to ride their bike outside or if you like to take night rides. It will help cars and other bikes be aware of where you are located and it is just so helpful to young riders. The installation process was done in less than a minute and it sticks on your bike very well. The quality of this set is unparalleled and allows for no questions if it is worth your money.
B00ICTF9A2|5|I like them perfect fit, soap materials
B000RFSARI|5|I use this to do rinse out my Sewer Hose. Works perfect.
B004557X3I|5|love it
B0140MJYDM|5|I just got these in. I have installed them in my Rav. Usually I don't bother with reviews, but I feel I have to. These are a perfect fit so well worth the money to protect my investment in my Rav. Anyone on the fence about purchasing them should not question you cannot go wrong with the digital fit liners!!
B00RM327NG|5|I love this magnet....it is my second one that I buy....I first got one for my car and loved it so much that I bought one for my husband's car.  I'll be buying one more for my dad's car soon!!!!
B001G8AIMU|1|find a dot not bu.  good for very minor items
B001GN3EVM|5|They work well but I failed to properly secure one of them and lost it. I'll be buying another, but I'll secure it properly this time.
B00RE6KV48|5|leather rescue is a life saver! i was able to condition my sofa just three times to get out cat claw marks! amazing!
B00RW112NY|5|Awesome but remember to cover it from the sun, lord it gets hot!
B0012TT09A|5|Everything went great, from time of order to installation ''. And the price was 1/3 of local places!!
B000VAQIM8|5|It took care of the problem
B00P30XVQW|5|I love it .
B0097AA126|1|They don't hold a bulb securely in place and with smallest shake, the bulb comes off. return.
B004AIHSF8|5|Part arrived on-time, and ready for installation (arrived lubricated). Nearly exact replacement for the original equipment on my 2002 Nissan Sentra driver-side front. Purchasing the regulator/motor assembly saved time! I would definitely use this supplier again.
B0002Q86JY|1|Second one I ordered.  First one had broken mounting bracket.  Was returned. Received this one, was unable to install due to illness.  Finally installed and it doesn't work.  Tried several hook ups, none worked.  No sound at all.
B00Y22JCG0|5|Very high quality product! Fits perfect and would recommend this to anyone who loves Carbon Fiber! This is real Carbon Fiber not an overlay! Great for the price and very fast shipping! Great company to work with!
B004EDF8HY|5|Good quality
B001KS86XO|4|HAVE HEARD THE 2-SIDED ADHESIVE STRIPS SUPPLIED ARE PRONE TO FAIL... SO REPLACED THEM WITH 3M TAPE ON AN EARLIER MIRROR GLASS BOUGHT FOR MY SUBARU A YEAR EARLIER... AND THIS TIME I ADDED THE TAPE THAT CAME WITH MY SUBIE GLASS TO THE TAPE SUPPLIED WITH THIS MIRROR FOR MY DAUGHTER'S JEEP ... AND SOFAR BOTH ARE HOLDING UP...<br /><br />THE GLASS ON BOTH FIT VERY WELL TO THE SIZE/SHAPE OF THE RESPECTIVE OEM GLASS BACKING/MOUNTING PLATES AND<br />THUS MAKE A VERY ACCEPTABLE REPAIR IN LIEU OF AN ENTIRE MIRROR ASSEMBLY WHICH WOULD COST MANY MULTIPLES<br />OF THIS GLASS ALONE... WHICH IS REALLY ALL THAT BREAKS/NEEDS REPLACEMENT USUALLY.
B00J4TVRKK|3|Got the bike together but unable to ride due to it constantly going dead, coming to find out the battery was no good, have to buy another battery
B002G5DLMQ|5|Easy to put on and I love the way it looks!
B002QOYS42|5|Nice cup holder but does not  go well with  my bike 2014 ultra limited
B00CB6QJEC|5|Arrived ahead of scheduled date.  Have had many comments about it, so at least it is doing what I wanted it to do, make people think.
B00DJACZ56|5|It has been very effective in reducing the heat in the all black interior of my car.
B005VKLGUW|5|great product. saved me a couple hundred bucks
B00CTFMZJS|5|Works great.
B005ESF328|5|truck looks very nice,easy to install and price was also good
B00CF5ICJ4|5|looks good and fits well<br />thanks
B004J0UIH2|5|Want to find a better than factory fan for your Kia? This is it. I love Depo. I have had plenty of their products on other vehicle and it is in my opinion that they far exceed OEM in certain aspects, this especially being one of them The fan was plug and play in my 2002 kia rio and solved my over temp/blown 20A fuse issue (duh)
B00WH6Z0UA|5|Good leather gel and made handbags shine and looks like new
B000JZ9T4O|1|Wrong part...!!!
B00KY6V3NI|5|Amazing exhaust
B005R4LPD0|5|Absolutely easy installation with adapter included and great upgrade!
B00TO7N08Y|4|Very satisfied with product.First when opening pkg they felt thin and made me worry they would look cheap when on vehicle.I was so wrong.They look amazing, very impressed.Totally changed the look of  my car.
B007A8IB6K|5|Perfect replacement.
B003JLDQNK|3|I love Motocentric gear; this is my 5th one. But this one is a bit too big to lay down on my VTX  or CB1000R.  Hopeful it will break in and fit better. If the magnet straps were an inch longer, they would reach the tank  to grab hold. I may take it to a cobbler to extend strap length. It's a good size bag to complement the sport saddlebags on long trips. These tank bags are great for day trips too to keep jacket  and pants pockets flat.
B00DW4YOZS|5|good product
B004IEEMYO|3|Be very careful these are sensitive and can short out if not installed carefully
B00E3UM876|3|OK<br />good eye protection
B00D394DO4|4|Awning was great but it would have been nice to have some instalation instructions especially since the end caps can be lethal when they come off
B008G3A9FY|5|PARTS FIT PERFECTLY. CHANGES THE WHOLE LOOK OF THE TRUCK
B000IYH5DS|3|Not the quality of the past....weighs less and doesn't fit as tight as they used to.
B002UZ7O3Y|5|great price, right fit
B00387C46A|5|Great quality.  Solid and nice finish.  Be advised these are on the stiff side.
B00SEOIQ32|5|Got into a fender bender last week,ordered the headlight pair and was blown away at the quality and fit. I have a 2008 chevy Silverado WT and everything on it was black except for the head and tail lights. installation was a snap and they look way better than the stock ones. Looking to buy blackened tail lights and led bulbs. this is the first time using Amazon and I have to say, the price, shipping, and quality are all outstanding. I will be shopping for more goodies today!!!!!!!!!!!
B00QWSNIT4|1|I dislike
B00ITL54M6|5|definitely exactly what i needed with the custom work done to the Busa
B0002SRCK6|5|AAAA++++
B004AW7XYU|5|Works great!
B009NMH70M|5|Great
B00PU7WHMM|2|I have a few msg's and get not response I'm not happy with my order i ordered two pair only got one pair and the ad said two pair and i paid for two pair and i would like you to plz make this right thank you .
B0055VKN4C|5|Fun addition to my all black laptop. Many people are scared to see a scary Darth Maul looking at them!
B00WB209CO|1|THE BIG ONES ARE GOOD BUT THE LITTLE SIDE WINDOW ONES ARE A WASTE OF MONEY SHOULD HAD WENT FOR THE LESS EXPENCIVE ONE UNSTEAD OF THE SET. VERY DISAPPOINTED. WILL NOT ORDER FROM YOU AGAIN BECAUSE YOU PUT THINGS IN MY ORDER THAT I DID NOT ORDER... AND CHARGED ME FOR THEM.
B0002Z9QRG|5|Great, long lasting, more bang for the bucks.
B01093Q9BQ|5|I spend a lot of time at the computer and this Gelepad saves me so much pain and related stress! The padding so comfortable and supportive. What a fabulous invention! It stays right where I put it and the adhesive is so flexible, I can travel with it and use it anywhere. Even after a year of use, it still provides support and adheres to any desktop like new.
B001SGXA84|5|I need a shock to the left and to the right information that appears in this price
B0040M30U6|4|Was easy to install.
B00DO04MTS|5|Nice floor liners, great fit
B006GHFXX0|5|thank you
B012JHUQ82|1|Garbage Latex Stickers! Not worth the $10. Very Dissapointed. Just tape emblem off and spray the emblem black yourself. You'll be way happier.
B00W69XSKW|3|This seat belt handle, might work for other cars. For me the thing slips down the seat belt, so I have to retreave it all the time. It does stand straight out so you can grab it. Have to find some way to make it stay up on the seat belt to be useful.
B00YML13OU|5|It is amazing how much more patient drivers are with you when they see these on the car. I probably should have gotten them for my parents in their waning years.
B00KTHW3MW|4|Unlike the picture here mine did not come with the metal &#34;tree&#34; you see inside the case.  No problem, I took the one from my old case and it works perfectly.
B00DX8D5E4|5|Ah , did the trick ,very much needed since I changed out my headers and exhaust n workin on cobra air filter to match cobra exhaust,, power commander 5 properly mapped got my gas mileage back n some extra horses! !
B003NTPE9W|5|Love this coating. If your a jeeper you know that frame rust is real life! The only thing I will say is that it tends to kind of go everywhere when using it. Make sure you cover your ride as much as possible when using this product. Arrived on time and price was on point. Will order more cans for my  other wranglers
B0033DNJ4K|5|you cant beat fel-pro
B000CNAVEU|4|I don't feel any difference in engine mount rigidity but the concept makes sense. Engine hoist or multiple jacks makes for an easier install
B00GX4Y9AY|5|We were worried that this was not going to work but it has been working alot better than both of thought it would it is not that big and thats good i love all the attachments that come with this overall this is grate
B00UMWZVV4|2|The price is great, but the installation documentation is basically useless.<br />Unless you are an experienced engineer/technician, or are willing to pay<br />an installer lots of extra money to reverse engineer this kit, I'd avoid it and buy<br />a Bulldog instead.
B00CBDIJ98|5|Excellent
B004QEQIN4|1|doesnt always work hit and miss. hope it doesnt get stuck down
B00WH1ZC80|5|Seems to do as was intended.  Presently, I'm using it to hang my purse on.  When I have a passenger in the car, there's no place up front for it.  Works perfectly!
B00KTICEZ2|5|My old remote was wearing out, so I decided to finally change it.  This one works like the original.  Easy to swap out inside. Glow in the dark feature really doesn't help.
B00KMR4B7E|5|Easy to install, just be sure to clean the truck surface with alcohol or acetone first.  Works great.  Hang it by the end for a few days to get the curl out, it's not a rigid piece of plastic. The hanging uncurls it better, and lets you install it very smoothly.  I'm glad I bought this one.
B00EHE7UFI|5|Very good
B000760FWU|5|Great product and a Fair price..
B00029KC2K|3|It does protect against SOME radiant heat but it also becomes heat soaked... kinda odd...
B00S6U5FEW|5|Received very quickly. quality product.
B00QU6Q4SK|4|Sun roof piece did not fit
B00NHYDKCG|5|As described
B00KOECXL6|5|Excelent product
B00JCHNDVA|2|The letters are stickers. Not BMW quality.
B0002UEOP0|5|good stuff.
B0001EWQZ2|5|Fit perfectly easy on
B002YEFQFO|5|works as advertised, nothing fancy
B000GZR39U|1|The mini hex bolt broke as soon as I tighten it down<br />Unacceptable
B005IF36OY|2|I hoped it would be more quiet.  I was looking for performance/mileage increase and looks but with a stock sound.  Corsa advertises no-drone exhaust technology so I took a chance on this system hoping that it would be close to stock.  When I was younger, I may have enjoyed this exhaust tone but I'm old now and the on-throttle drone is annoying to me especially going up hills.  The fact is, it's too loud for me and these Ecoboost V6s, or most V6 engines for that matter, are difficult to make sound good.  I tried to return it but the seller refused.  Oh well.  An expensive mistake.  Otherwise a good quality exhaust system that's lighter than stock and has increased my mileage by 2mpg (from 17 to 19).
B00J9KPWOQ|5|I put this on my car myself and it looks great with the info I already had on there. It is a great quality and lasted through a CHICAGO winter! Still intact and no chips or peels. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B00SABMFUY|3|Expected the quality to be a little better for the price and it is also hard to keep it in place
B00HEPH26O|5|Exactly as advertised.
B00820LW7U|5|Very nice set
B002ZTK9D2|1|Don't buy it. I had these on 2014 RX350 F-SPORT and I wasn't happy. Just like the other person said:  the edges squeezes up when you move either the passenger or driver's seat. Liner is made of very thin plastic and moves around under your feet (there are no mounts/anchors unlike the front; the bottom has no spikes to hold it in place). You may as well put a newspaper on the floor and it will work as good as this liner. Good idea but poor execution. I switched to rubber mats. At least they stay firmly in place and and don't slide around.
B00LMUXP7W|5|great
B006FP6EBI|5|My daughter loves this necklace! Great price, great quality!
B0080CL9GO|5|Very satisfied
B001ARNN0G|5|Worked, does the job.
B00JBNYYQ8|1|Horrible doesn't do what it should
B00H7R2R28|1|Very cheap low quality material. Haven't use it yet the material is bent already.  Tried using it and due to the inferior quality of the product, the key fob would get stuck inside the key hole.  I threw mine away after one try.
B008Y9193G|5|Quick delivery and part works great.
B0041TOOHQ|2|Read the other reviews and they were right. This product is very NOISY. Turned the AC all the way up today, and my friend commented that he thought that he was about to be attacked (due to the loud noise). Will be returning if I can.
B002NBOWI0|5|Easy to install and did the job with no hassle at all. All you need to do is watch a YouTube video in order to figure out how to install.
B0017OFWAG|5|great price...fast shipping
B00BR1TP2A|3|Bulb died after 10 hours of use over a year...a bit disappointing...and I can't seem to find a replacement bulb... :(
B003TLWV40|2|I order 2 of this starter 1 is ok and 1 very weak to start ! Cheap but not good I should not order it
B002U6I3BK|5|Quick shipping and great pricing!
B001C6UJP2|3|I purchased these as a replacement to my worn GXP drilled rotors. I installed these with aftermarket OEM quality ceramic pads and torqued everything up. After about 8,000 miles I have grooves on the face (more than I would expect) and have a slight vibration under light braking. I didn't have this on my previous rotors. Although there are many factors that can cause this the grooving and vibration are causing me to lean towards the rotor as the culprit. I hope you have a different experience.
B00T9N6DPK|2|I returned mine due to a missing dust cap. Also appeared to be a little flimsy and I believe the locking cap could be pried off fairly easy due to the large flat edge.
B00HA1NO14|4|Didn't fit as tight as I thought it would in 2013 GMC Terrain.
B004HCOE72|5|This kit is a bit overpriced at this time (for what you get)...I bought it at the end of last year on sale.  This kit is still cheaper on Amazon that at the local big box.  I'd recommend you &#34;roll your own kit&#34; by purchasing the same individual components that are in this package (more bang for your buck).  Having said that, I finally got around to sanding/buffing out my very oxidized headlights.  I spent maybe 45 minutes total on both headlights and the results are amazing.  I gave them a thorough sanding with sandpaper I already had (1000 grit followed by a 2500 grit) using a rubber sanding block.  After sanding, the headlights were &#34;white hazed&#34; until I buffed them out with Meguiar's PlastX...that compound is amazing.  I then followed up with Meguiar's Headlight Protectant.  My headlights now look brand new!
B0068Q57BM|5|Worked perfectly removing asphalt and stone dust from cars.
B000JFJLP6|5|Works on my big truck... best I have owned. I always feel better knowing this in the back of the truck.
B006K8NGPC|5|Fits good and looks good
B00V97EHUW|1|I am not happy at all there are 4 white seals that go on the input shaft that do not fit I put them on and it did not work it was slipping when I drove it  I open the transition and the white seal were gon it coused. It to burn up the cliches  in it so now I need to by a bather kit but I do not have abbey money
B00JMD4GGA|2|The helmet looks great. The lifting face and the built in sun glasses are amazing. The helmet is a little uncomfortable on my forehead, there are two hard Styrofoam pieces under a thin layer of padding that dig into my forehead causing a slight headache, and yes the helmet is a perfect fit. The intercom system and blue tooth I am disappointed in. Highly disappointed in actually. At forty five mimes an hour you can't hear whom you are connected with and they can't hear you. Under forty five is great but not at distances anywhere near fifteen hundred feet. The best feature with the Bluetooth system is the music. You cab hear that at speeds of over 100 mph.
B00G8WLX78|5|Effortless transaction, product fine.
B0023WJ7NE|5|Better than Original!
B005517IAO|5|Haven't installed it yet but its a quality holley product.
B003PHXTZS|5|Great hitch. My husband installed it (he is really good at stuff like that) on our Hyundai Sonata. It has worked perfectly for towing both our motorcycles on the trailer and our bikes using our hitch mount bicycle rack. It is very low profile and you hardly even notice that is it there.
B000P6URZM|5|right product at the right price with fast shipping....perfect!
B00NX8EYFI|5|Cute little minion face. Easy to apply & it will be simple to remove when we turn in the lease car.
B000B8WMAW|5|very nice product! my husband loved them in his mancave! fast delivery
B00CW67U08|5|Little hard to fit ..but great quality
B004EIAADG|5|First came defective but they quickly replaced it and it works great.
B00CORBQUA|5|Exceptionally bright and white, no more yellow looking lights! Easy install
B00B3WF0FY|5|Nice lanyard !!! Authentic
B004A6JA2O|5|Just as described. Fits perfectly on a 2012 Toyota Prius. Very good quality and low cost cabin filter. Saved around $25 compared to dealer
B00768HDQS|4|Perfect fit
B00480GYSA|4|So far so good
B00JQ6IJXO|5|Delivery time was excellent, easily installed, looks great.
B006MX81FA|3|Back seats won't fit. Other than that good bang for the bucks.
B00S4B1IUI|1|iCarSoft says that this model does NOT support Mercedes Benz vehicles!  I purchased it because this ad says that is is for Mercedes... NOT
B00PFCRJAM|5|Didn't expect much from these due to the price but was I wrong.... These are soooo bright I got two mounted into my front bumper and two mounted into my rear bumper. Great fog and reverse lights I couldn't be happier
B000BM8RT8|5|Comes in a little case with accessories,  Fits behind a truck seat barely.  Works well to re inflate tires after the dunes.
B000GUWQJM|4|No tappet block gaskets as shown and specified in description.  Great pushrods still.
B00U2COE7G|3|Not a very modern look. Bulky. Gaudy. Something out of the 80's.
B00FY1XY0S|5|I love this.  It makes my heart a little happier when I see it. And it has held up in all sorts of weather.
B000CQBG1O|4|fast delivery; good price
B001A7RP32|5|This is a very nice shade for the money, and it included a storage case.  Would have loved for it to extend a bit lower, but addressed that by covering my wiper blades with a swimming pool noodle that I slit halfway.  This both protects the blades from premature decay from sun and debris, and helps block the area between the hood and windshield from filling with leaves and pine needles.
B0082LKQCG|3|A little flimsy in my opinion. Not as strong as expected.
B00418VYDY|5|Love love love it.
B004D8XKIE|5|Loved!
B005SFVN58|5|The case was perfect.. I ended up going to the dealer to get the key cut..cost $25 plus the $10ish for the case..Worked for me!
B001EOYIYA|5|This was very simple to install, no splicing or drilling needed. The most difficult part was pulling the van's interior lining back to conceal the box and cables (which in all honesty wasn't that hard). The instructions seemed to leave out the step about connecting the ground wire but it wasn't hard to find a place to attach it.<br /><br />It works great, simple to install, would definitely recommend.
B011573F12|1|Just terrible!  Definitely not worth the money.
B00BQYCJNU|5|Does the job.
B002V4VLOC|5|Now here's a product that really cleans brass! Unreal!!! Smells a little strong but talk about no rubbing at all!!!!!!
B00EDFM3TY|5|I purchase these for my RV. They are very bright and do not put off Heat like the lights that came with my RV.
B000FIWKQY|1|These are made of cheap plastic and not ONE of the 4 I ordered work after 2 months.  Poorly made with two based below the solar panel cracking off during the first install into a hole I dug.  Not impressed.
B007JSGR9Y|1|After 6 mo. &#34;Only used a couple times&#34; the screen has gone bad, I'm not able to read anything! it's trash.
B00DU4RL00|2|Not the best quality sticker I've ever purchased. The image quality was grainy and looked like it was printed with an ink jet printer. I probably would have had better luck with a nice quality paper print, taped to the inside of my rear window.
B00CI1Z770|5|Use this sticker on a water bottle for my son and husband.  They absolutely love them!!
B005LGTSIS|5|The cable was a match to the original. It's been working perfectly since I installed it. Would order again. Price is right; so is the quality.
B00S10MEGY|5|Fantastic!  Easy to install!
B008G3A82S|5|Good price. Very good delivery time and parts fit perfectly.
B00Y195VNM|5|Easy to cut to make it fit. I knew beforehand it would not be perfect on my Elantra, but it's good even if there is an inch or two uncovered in the back.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Strong and well made. Used it on 7 hours to Fla loaded to the max and held up with no problems. Did not have any rain but it seemed to be water proof caused the material is pretty thick. Straps worked will and had no problems attaching it to a Honda Van. We also used 6, 3 ft bungi cords for extra hold down. Better safe than sorry!<br />Great buy would highly recommend!
B00J46EJN0|5|No problems
B00HLM7G0M|5|best led lights out there
B0006IX7UQ|5|My ice maker broke and I decide that 100 bucks to fix it wasn't worth it, so I purchased some ice cube trays.  The only issue was to get the right size that would still work with the dispenser unit, it was straight out the the book 3 little bears... Lol.  In the end this size was perfect for being used in the ice dispenser.
B00PZSKJ62|5|It came rally fast and it was exactly what we needed.
B00KGGTF9U|5|Does what is says,  we use this on my wife's sedan and it is a perfect fit!
B006GFAJGI|5|Strong, nice & bright
B0068ESK1I|5|All is good!
B004GDPV42|5|It came with some kind of adhesive and was really easy to install after watching a YouTube video demonstrating it.
B00OO2CNIW|5|Great fit
B00HPTLM92|4|Appears to be an OEM honda product
B008VFQE42|1|This does not fit any Jerry Can that I have.
B000R2MT82|5|It's compact and works at a 25-50 yd. distance.
B0084UKB2K|5|great item
B00PGM0V7E|5|Good quality
B00FFMK17U|5|Just  one item  good
B006E59GZU|5|I purchased these for my mother. She lives in an apartment building where people decorate their doors. She wanted to show her heritage.
B00LHB08C6|5|Love it
B002WVURUS|5|Shipped quick! Very cute! Thanks!!!
B0044B0ZEW|5|Great oem product at great price
B00JIK1KAM|5|This is so good it is the perfect air freshener
B007HRHIN6|5|Love it
B006E4DBRA|5|Excellent product.  Brighter than the flourescent bulbs they replaced.
B0002KKIVO|5|Great item
B0048J4Q6I|2|I installed the 11M32 power window motor on the driver's side of my 2002 Chevy S10 about a month ago (Aug 1, 2015) and it works great. I had to buy a larger rivet tool at Harbor Freight to use the larger rivets that came with the motor.  Update (May 25, 2017) The motor started failing about a month ago and will now barely work. Went from 4 stars to 2 because it worked for a while, but the OEM motor should have lasted longer than 20 months.
B001F115FW|5|Cleans hands thoroughly, and smells great.
B0085XV9JA|2|Very very small
B00498DSM6|4|adequate replacement of OEM belt
B001GMJHZ0|5|READ THIS whole review.. You won't regret it. Sorry it's a bit lengthy, I'm an elementary school teacher. I know how to talk.  First of all, these surpassed my expectations for side steps for my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon. I had been researching all over Amazon for side steps for my Jeep. I saw others that were Amazon Prime for $149 and had decent reviews, but my old friend from Florida (a true redneck) told me I HAD to &#34;buy N-Fab or nothing at all.&#34;  When a redneck gives you truck advice, you listen to it. I bought these N-Fab side steps after looking through all the reviews. Multiple people said they needed to widen the bolt holes on their Jeep. You don't. I used 3 bolts to the body and 3 bolts to the pinch frame on each side, and it easily held myself and my neighbor at the same time. We aren't little guys, either.  It took two of us to bolt it right on in just short of an hour and a half. The two of us held it up, put in the bolts and tightened them right up. The only issue we had was the rear bolt on both sides. The bolt went in on a little bit of an angle due to the bolt spot on the Jeep chassis. But it was a straight bolt on installation. No drilling required.  The best part was when I caught my neighbors staring out the window and driving by staring at the Jeep. These suckers look MEAN on the truck.  There is simply nothing like them out there. I was also incredibly surprised with 4Wheel's shipping. The bars were well wrapped and in mint condition. Also, I decided to pay $334 for these, although I found them on Amazon Prime for $350 with two-day shipping.. So glad I bought from 4Wheel Online because I ordered them Monday and got them today (Wednesday). I wasn't expecting them until Friday at the earliest.  Guys (and girls) to sum up... Buy these side steps!!! You will not regret it!
B00NPQV06O|5|Great quality light. We mounted this on our Toyota Tundra. We use this light frequently both when using the truck for our own stuff and when using it on Search & Rescue calls.
B0030CC2XI|5|Look great and do the job, but really who drives with their doors on!
B000C59ST2|3|2004 Grand Cherokee:<br /><br />Bought this to eliminate a funky side-to-side movement, especially during slight turns over uneven roads.<br /><br />This unit is ~30% beefier than the stock one and has a metal case (versus the factory's plastic-cased dampener). It does not look, nor is configured like the factory dampener (see attached photo).<br /><br />You'll need 2-15mm wrenches, because there is a bolt and nut holding the stock dampener at the end closest to the wheel. The other end is a lone bolt. You won't need to put the car on jacks. I just made sure my front wheels were pointed straight.<br /><br />After replacing the old and tired factory one with this new one - the funky side-to-side movement did not improve all that much. But, sharper turns and U-turns are noticeably smoother and tighter.<br /><br />If I were to do this again, I would purchase a heavier duty off road use type dampener - for a few dollars more.
B001CJYBGW|5|Perfect fit and works great!
B00GIHSCHC|5|Perfect for alley-lights/side-facing lights.
B001V8RYTA|4|Good idea but two of them bent when pushing in the ground, they need more sturdiness.
B00MH4663C|5|I like it
B0074UR9WQ|5|These work great have one on my Harley ultra classic and this one is going on my Harley road king! These work good in case your starter button don't work!
B000C18QN0|5|Fits my 1988 Caddy perfect  - nice and sturdy.
B00B1C0WX6|3|Had to have it as a replacement.
B0065M5GJ2|5|Fits perfectly!
B004MSDRJC|4|Nothin super fancy. Looks nice.
B00BI170BC|4|Spraying this product on a convertible top is labor intensive as you want to mask off any plastic, paint or rubber that the overspray may land on. I prefer using a paint brush to apply it, but that uses up more product that way. Once applied, it lasts about a year. I've been using it for over 6 years and am completely satisfied.
B00VQWK42A|5|looks great on my a5 sline
B002P8RBIE|5|A good replacement mirror. Fit exactly as it should have. Now I just need to paint it to match.
B00TF7BVWK|4|Little on the large side, but works well. Since this is in my trunk it would be nice if there could be something that would allow me to attach it somewhere so it will not move.
B0009XQUKC|5|works great
B00C0SQ8KG|4|Well I ordered this lightbar figured id give it a shot it came reasonably quick I bought a separate wiring harness and got it hooked up but 2 of the flood lights didn't work so I contacted the seller and all they asked for was a picture and after that I  paid 12$ too ship it and I got to keep the old one. I put the semi broken one through a torture test I power washed the hell out of it and it got rained on twice and it still don't leak and works like when I unboxed it. super bright light and good customer service
B0094B8QDE|5|Was a nice fit and easy to mount looks very good
B000C5WCUE|5|very good and fast service would order again
B003TQ2W44|5|Bought this to check the pressure in my motorcycle tires as normal gauges were too difficult to maneuver in the tight space. Works great, and the bleed feature is perfect for dialing in the correct PSI.
B00H7DSX2A|1|The dimensions on the description were not the same when I measured the battery, but when I measured the box they matched. Needless to say I couldn't use this battery.
B000BQRGQO|4|Worked as advertised.
B00HZTDKZG|5|Got this to replace a failing trickle charger that drained the bike battery. So far so good, Hopefully it will last for a while.
B002AUL2HS|5|Totally worth it! Great product.
B006WQRCT8|5|Great price on a good product and it comes with the mating bolts
B007USCM7E|5|A/C Pro worked in my car (as long as there is some freon in your system)  It's a cheap way to find out.  My A/C is as cold as it ever was (13 yrs. old)  Make sure you have some knowledge of auto A/C and how system works. One can should do it and freeze you out  Hook it up right!
B00KTICEZ2|5|Pretty good product
B003BYFTEE|5|Worked great between back seats in 2012 Buick Enclave.
B00IBOS6EE|5|'Nuff said
B00MWH72IW|5|just what I needed
B010HM43RQ|5|.I measured this against a Fluke brand meter. It is accurate @ 13.6 V.<br /><br />Install was easy and quality was good.
B000XBBISO|5|OEM replacement part repaired the RV toilet easily.
B003NU9O0G|5|These sockets work great and don't seem cheap even though they were. Very happy with my purchase.
B010O55JTM|5|Two storms , 10 car washes and 6k miles looks good like new ,105 degrees sun !
B00IW0CWUQ|2|couldn't see it my car windows are to dark
B000MK2C9U|5|this system gave my truck some zing
B000C2AKAG|5|Fel-Pro head gasket set. Does what it says and all parts included. Some people have complained that the intake gaskets in this kit are made of plastic. They are but so are the factory GM ones.
B004BOTMZA|1|To short for forward controls.
B0086W7IZE|5|Gift.
B00O83NJWQ|1|Its been almost a week wating after that came broken
B00E0FRXII|5|I loves this jacket, i was alittle worried with the size issue everyone was talking about, but i did size up one and it is a perfect fit. Made very well, awesome quality. My size is normally US Medium, and ordered the jacket in a large and it fit great.
B000JZ9T4O|5|It does what is is suppose to do. And is a perfect fit.
B0051SO7JQ|3|Worked well new, but stopped working after about a year.  Only used to jumpstart cars an not often.
B000EQW1AC|5|AAAA++++
B00068XCQU|5|I USE THIS ON MY VEHICLES , I HAVE 3 OF THEM !
B007HO5HZU|5|Awesome!
B009FUF6DM|5|Great cleaning towels. Durable.
B007OWGA4C|3|Very pretty and very cool. All you have to do is plug them in the cigarette lighter and there you go! The only downside is the adhesive tape does not stick. It lasted a total of 3 weeks, and since it's summer here in Illinois( which the hottest it'll get is 90, barely) they would fall off every morning until they eventually lost their stickyness completely. I just superglued them instead.
B003UT085U|5|No problems
B00SM7IO2E|5|easy to install works great
B000R4U2FM|4|it measures,  what else do you want
B000VAODBQ|5|Great product.
B007EEVKZO|5|This carb was used to replace a factory carb on a 2009 Yamaha Raptor 350 that was beyond reasonable home methods of cleaning due to years of neglect.<br /><br />Pros- It fit properly and installed without any modifications. It was slightly more expensive than a rebuild kit, but was a whole unit rather than just a few internals and gaskets. Included all parts, screws, choke boot, plate that covers where throttle cable hooks to carb. Works properly.<br /><br />Cons- packaging was more than horrible. It was a layer of small-bubble bubble wrap around the carb unit, then shoved in a plastic baggie mailer. The carb had popped all the bubbles and actually worn through the bubble wrap around the intake side and had signs of the metal surfaces being banged around unprotected in the mail truck. For a precision component I found this unacceptable but they got me by the balls for the low price so I installed it anyway and it worked. Also the throttle plate was bent and I tried to bend it back into shape with pliers gently. I ended up using the old cover due to this bend.<br /><br />There is an additional tube on the side for a fuel/vacuum line that my raptor does not need so I blocked it off with a piece of fuel hose folded in half and then zip tied against itself to seal it.. Not truly a direct replacement imho; more a semi universal unit that fits a few makes and models that may or may not use that feature. Be aware of this but don't be discouraged by it.<br /><br />Overall worth buying since a rebuild kit is like $50-60. All it needed was a slight turn of the idle knob to run perfectly.
B00DQSSNAW|5|I don't know how Amazon &#34;FIXED&#34; the bad shipping for the better by Amazon. This is a well made easy to install product and it works very well, it is bright and visible in daylight. If I had a place to mount another one I would buy it again.
B000C561Q0|5|Made in Japan. Great quality. Better price than Toyota OEM but still Japan made. So far so good
B0055EK3JO|5|Cool finishing look
B001CBMXNI|5|This is the only battery I will buy for my 1995 Dodge Viper, fits just right in the rear wheel well, cranks up the V10 with no hesitation and last longer than any previous batteries I've used in the past.  Highly recommend!
B009NOZ5AY|3|This bulb may be wonderful , 'my garage' said it would fit my 2004 Ranger Edge 3.0 4X2, it does not. Totally different bulb. How this help my fellow shopper.  Update:2004 Ranger Edge 3.0 4X2 dome light requires a 912 base bulb.
B00QJWUPC6|1|I just bought them in May and they don't work no more...
B00DSD5TMK|5|Perfect as from 1984.
B0042KMX18|5|I use this on everything, so I by it by the gallon!! in my opinion this is the  best instant detailer made !!
B007HSXZ1O|5|real.
B00LBA6WO6|5|excelente
B00JXYENS4|5|Just as expected
B000C7YRNM|5|Works as should
B00BWWZSBG|5|perfect fit.
B00DOAEFTK|5|Worked well seams to be good produst
B00QNOIX9M|5|You won't be disappointed with this direct fit suspension air spring.
B0023VFB2G|5|Awesome
B006SYNF9K|5|Love it. I was scared that it wouldn't fit my car but it does. I have a Jetta VW. It really helps keep the car cooler so my seats, steering wheel, and gear shifter don't burn my skin.
B001CEJH0W|5|The truck smells great
B000ELP8GQ|5|Great product, at a great price. Fast shipping also.
B00DI3DV6G|5|Great storage bag that folds up to take up less space!
B00KTP4138|5|Perfect fit on my 2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Big Horn. Look great and work very effective from side splash and splatter. My truck actually stays clean now.
B004HCOE8Q|5|perfect
B007SYL8R0|1|Does not have turn signals! Disappointed.
B00DPIF2MU|5|The parts were exactly what I ordered. It was tricky trying to get the plastic housings off the rail ends but once that was complete these cross bars fit right into place. I am very pleased with this product.
B004FBGW48|5|I really love this! Makes it so much nicer to ride.
B00EZBPDI4|5|Looks good and fits well<br />thanks
B00AKFNBNI|5|great
B00C5T2W3W|5|Worked great fit just right
B00XFNI3L2|5|Great quality. Nice and thick.
B005CRKW7M|5|every thing i wanted and ship on time
B005EPLJ9W|2|Was thrilled I found this, but when I installed it, nothing worked. I don't know if I'm missing something, but I plugged it in just like the old one was and put everything back how it was. Still nothing. Old one still works, but this one didn't. I guess I'll just deal with it for now.
B012KLV1H2|5|This is a great bag that can attach right onto the seat. If you have kids, you should definitely get one of these...Great waterproof material, termo pocket, easy install and just no more mess on the floor of the back seat. I definitely recommend!
B0059XCVVO|5|Can't beat the price and the look.
B00E9G0WAO|5|This part worked as expected.  A few minutes to swap out the part and the tractor was charging again.  There was an extra wire that was not used so I just left it unconnected.
B002A3MYOK|5|Easy to install.  Looks sturdy and fit the plate perfectly.
B000C2ZKDS|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B0042XI3D2|2|First fuse I tried could not be used.  It bent as soon as I tried to push it in, so I used an old one I had laying around instead.  The blades (on the new fuse) did not seem to be firmly held in place by much of anything.  If you simply pinch the blades from the side, they bend inward quite easily.  Maybe the rest will fare better.  Haven't had time or a need to try them all.
B004MDEV38|5|Great USA-made hitch.  Installed with a buddy in approximately 30 minutes and came with all necessary hardware.  Powdercoat paint looks good and durable.  Would purchase again.
B005HMHVSA|3|I like the white led quality,but I was shipped a bad bulb.
B00261FNB2|5|holds the tire well great for a quick fix before you get a proper tire carrier bumper I did have to clean up the threads before i used the kit
B0049Z85JK|4|A direct replacement and exact fit.
B006CRT72W|1|Tried and tried and cannot make it work.
B00XUL4052|5|Great quality! It's very glossy and matches tinted windows very well! Makes your car look richer and more modern. Happy costumer!
B00BFXSWMY|5|Video adapter cable worked fine. Easy to install and very durable.
B00PCL37H0|3|good
B00SCYVEPG|5|Quick delivery......not so much.  But they fit perfect and installation was a breeze and I had them installed in under 3 minutes.
B00REJXGME|5|It fits to a Ford f150 XL 2012. I buy it for my dad's birthday and he so pleased. I really recommend this product for my dad's is very useful.
B00KNMKRU8|5|Works like a charm.  The &#34;recondition&#34; feature brought one of my batteries back from the brink of death
B005CO9TC4|5|Good quality, great price.
B004J0WFS2|1|Did not fit the vehicle it stated it was intended for.
B0024NSSIM|3|😛👍👍👍👍👍
B00AIIKOEG|2|The mirror itself had some ragged edges and it vibrates when the car is moving. I don't really recommend this mirror.
B0049Z8X3I|5|This is a Genuine OEM Sprag Assembly that fit and works perfectly in my 2007 Chevrolet Suburban LTZ.
B00AM0WA1U|4|Not perfect but better than I expected.
B00MWFFUU6|5|Fit as expected . No issues .
B0116IHML4|5|I could finally put my trunk in order. It is spacious. Good material. Easy assembly. Lightweight, simply useful. Good buy！
B005446EVQ|5|Great product gets job done and the whole kit is great everything you need for maintaining leather products
B000AAMY86|5|I love these things. I bought this one for my Nephew, I've had one in the truck for years. I love to be able to monitor trans fluid temp and other items.It's helped me fix things too. High/unstable idle, my TPS sensor was reading 7% open at idle. That was a quick troubleshoot. Lean bank 1 code after check engine light. Vacuum line came off. 2 second fix, very obvious. It can do a lot of other cool stuff too.
B008R95GA0|3|Not worth it
B00O3QCJ74|2|I ordered it this item, thinking it would be bigger than it was, totally my fault. That is one reason this item received 2 stars. The other? You cannot adjust it at night time to keep headlights out of the rear-view mirror. I did order the 300mm mirror, with the blue tint, as a replacement for this item, so hopefully it's more along the lines of what I thought I originally ordered with this item.
B00K35ZU9I|5|Good product
B002UM73GA|1|does not Fit, needs massive trimming!
B00ZZQ51P8|1|To small , hard to put it on , no good.
B0041CC8AI|5|all perfect
B00FFDPPCA|5|Perfect fit, worked as expected.
B00XBEJZA8|5|I purchased this light bar for my husband.  He's been asking for one for quite some time now.  This is a curved light bar.  The packaging on this product was two boxes heavily taped together.  Product was undamaged and in perfect condition. I made a suggestion to the seller to use a bigger box.  This light bar will probably end up on one of our vehicles or our golf cart.  The brightness is phenomenal.  When the light bar is on it looks like daylight outside. The distance of the light beam is great too.  This light bar would be great for woods and trail riding. I have recommended this product to others.  There are a lot of jeep clubs and woods/trail riders in my area and I know they could benefit from this light bar hence my recommendation to them. I will be purchasing a longer light bar in the near future as well.<br /><br />** I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my thoughts, experiences, and a honest written review **
B0040DXAWI|5|Works well. Huge improvement from OEM mirror.
B001PWFPE8|5|very easy install, it works great, you can open and close the tail gate with one hand and it will not slam down
B004GD141Q|3|Mounting screws would help.
B010R1NG34|5|It fits like a glove and it didn't have the rubber smell that most rubber mats carry for the first few days.<br />I have had it for almost a year and it is very durable and easy to clean and light weight.
B00RMD6NMW|5|Was easy to assemble and works great.
B00MBURW6M|5|Awesome decal.  It took a while to find an AT-AT with a boy, (not a girl).  I should have bought more.
B000760FWU|5|Exactly what I needed. Extra supports under our 2011 Montana. Worked great..
B00GHUFZAW|5|OEM part. The originals lasted 3 years. These should too.
B00NNM882Y|1|Cheap plastic and didn't fit. Tried to return it and have been getting the run around
B012CVQWEC|5|The ZHOL warm white LED bulbs that I received looked to be well constructed and at a low price point. I purchased these to replace the old 1141 light bulbs in my RV interior fixtures.<br /> These LED lamps were easy to install and fit well as a replacement. I tested each as I replaced and had no failures or issues with operation. I also compared the brightness and color of the LED lamps to the 1141 incandescent lamps and found them to be a close color match with very similar brightness.  This color and brightness looked to be very consistent in all 12 of the LED lamps I installed. I also placed my hand on each and felt for the amount of heat that the LED lamps produced and found that each was much cooler than the old lamps.<br />So far I am happy with these LED lamps and ready to use them when traveling to see if they perform as well on the road and for extended periods.
B009AQS5H0|5|love the frames. got them quickly. they look great. different.
B003NS5NK8|5|good deal
B00MIZT7OK|5|Cute and dangerous! The perfect combination for a lady!
B0031ZDU62|3|work well but screw hole was located at a different point and made it difficult to install.
B004C6I7WG|1|Cut terrible. Donated hat to Goodwill.
B003D4MCRO|5|this muffler is beautiful.
B00UBIMGSK|5|very easy to achieve a wonderful shine, and keep the finish you want. The black microfiber cloth that comes withe<br />the kit, did not even chalk up. Good product, good value, thank you.
B00480GYSA|5|Great upgrade!
B000VU7NL8|2|I received it today.  Rolled up and in a clear plastic bag, no box, but surprisingly made it OK.. No scuffs or abrasions.<br /><br />What I don't like, it's not all black as shown, it has many recycled looking specs of various material and colors throughout.  Looks/appears dirty but it's the specs in it.  The pic shows solid black.... not what I received.  Looks like a dirty mat.  I have a tonneau cover on my GMC Sierra with LED lighting, everything is black in the box... but again, the mat looks dirty.  Did I get an odd one?.....  Do they all come like this?.......<br /><br />Show an accurate picture Amazon / seller!
B0043AV4NK|4|like it
B005257R0O|5|Good paint, dries pretty quick too.
B0060L3ZUA|5|Loved my floormats
B000COC3VI|4|Great product! Thanks
B00M28RK1A|5|Good quality product. Precut like stated and was easy to install.
B0019C17AA|5|Very Good Product
B0002KR88A|5|Thanks guys, exactly what I expected it to be. A good quality in-line fuse. I used this for the new fog lights I put into my car and it works great. Shipping was on time. Yes, it doesn't come with a fuse, but I had one already so it wasn't a big deal anyways. Thanks!
B004BTAJ2A|5|Very Good Product
B000FQ7OIU|5|Easy to install, works perfect
B0010E3IUY|5|Perfect fit for our 2007 Ford Fusion!
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Good
B001ZTBRFC|5|Great battery. Charged it up my bike started faster than it ever has since I bought it 2yrs ago!  Love this battery
B00C8A2WZG|5|Fast delivery and mats fit my car like a glove.  Very satisfied with product
B00ASKRKUA|1|Must use Rugged Ridge 17235.56 Black A-Pillar Switch Pod ONLY
B0048B3YC8|5|These fit my Buick rendezvous perfectly. And you can't beat the price! They're not super high quality but the get the job done and look good. Definitely worth it.
B001SEUQF6|1|This is a load of crap.  Broke in 0NE WEEK.
B0065UK1K8|5|Great price and fast service
B0022ZXO40|5|Accurate
B00OX1WIT8|5|Really good product
B00P45NR92|4|Glad I got the extension.  it keeps stuff from moving all around in bed of my Silverado.
B0066S3XEK|5|Exactly the same fit as the original, at1/5th the price.
B0081XO50Y|5|Really wanted the Halos/LEDs and was amazed once I wired them up with a kill switch.<br />Second time ordering headlights online, first time LEDs.<br />Well worth the time and money spent, I recommend this item.
B00HR35JEK|4|as advertised but a little pricey
B00G49DVGG|4|The scent of this was pretty strong for me so i literally left all doors open and back hatch all day after use and added a fan to cargo area. I have a expedition and when i set it off in between my front and back seat i could clearly see the mist blowing around my car for about 3 minutes before the can ran out. It did a great job of getting rid of old pet odor and did not harm my leather seats at all. I would buy this again but i wish they had a more subtle scent or not scented at all. If you have and breathing issues.. allergies ect. use with caution.
B00HWGX04I|2|The part looks great on my 05 Mustang Convertible how ever the part flies off every time I flip the seat back. The parts are now in the glove box until I can figure out a more permanent mounting solution.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I've used this shade for about 5 days and it has kept my car cooler than the current one I had.  Covered my window completely. No sun is getting in!
B00KTIY7U2|5|Yet another steal from Amazon I just can't get enough I Love it!
B00061SGZO|5|Good quality product. Works well in my jeep shop. The C clamp portion of the set is super heavy duty unlike others on the market. The carting case is nice and holds all of the pieces nicely without them falling out in transport. The only thing I would recommend to the manufacturer is to make the clamp threaded stock fine thread instead of course so hand tools can be used instead of air as space is often limited when doing on ball joint swaps with axle instaled.
B000C40RVG|5|Fast ! No more bouncin' around.
B007ZDDUCK|4|Perfect for my Lexus leather interior, leaving it ultra-supple. Worth the money.<br />Con: cap dispenser crushed bcuz of old-style aluminum cap, which leaked all over. I was only able to retain about 90%.
B002UC4WZU|4|Works as advertised. Also as others have noted, the product seems to be priced higher than other external RV components.
B001JL42L2|5|great product easy install
B00R38HQQ8|5|Fit perfectly and shines very nicely. Made my bike look newer with such a simple addition.
B000R3WQPM|5|this helps alot and fits perfect
B000CFSJCY|5|Fits well. Works perfectly.
B0140WMBWS|3|Inexpensive made in China knock offs.  Will be adequate for street but not up to track environment.  Hard to confirm with out bench strut dyno but get the feeling the units have different compression numbers either due to lax factory QC or seals leaking.  You get what you pay for holds true here.
B007QBTS6S|4|Arrived fast and truck has started every time since.
B00DILTFP4|2|I'm not sure what the deal is. I entered my vehicle information and was pointed to these wipers. While they may be excellent wipers, the insert included to mount them on my Explorer are too narrow, rendering both blades unusable.
B010OBBIDW|2|Out of proportion to what the actual unit insignia is. Unacceptable.
B005FNKSMW|3|Works fine but came scratched and dented so doubtful this is new. Will work for now
B002NT1R6W|5|Part came later than promised, but that was probably the post office. Only a third of the price other places were asking for the same part, so it was worth the wait. Went in pretty easily, and fixed the bouncing speedometer needle, and engine hesitations of my 93 Civic. Thanks!
B006H34BUY|4|It does what it needs to do!!
B00029JXNO|5|Perfect !!
B00BQWQN1Q|4|I was removing and re-sealing the headlight assembly in my 2006 Ford Fusion so I figured I would replace the 3 year old Sylvania LL H-11 bulbs and replace them with these. I can't really see that much of a difference, other than the Sylvania LL bulbs were approx 3 years old, these might be a little brighter overall... maybe.
B005NLQAHS|5|Worked exactly as expected on my VW Passat and HTC One M9
B00AM1Y3X2|5|I love this oil.  Use it in all of my cars that have over 100K miles.
B00KV7GSJE|5|EVERYTHING WAS AS DESCRIBED AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH MY CHOICE OF PURCHASE. THANK YOU TO THE SELLER -T.W.
B00CHW032O|3|Loved the item,  I was however led to believe there were more than 1 sticker due to the ad.
B008AD1FI0|4|Took a chance and ordered this for my baja 70cc dirt bike there two different pictures the one they sent me was with choke on same side as fuel line which is opposite of stock. but it lined up and works perfect. the only bad thing is the choke rubs a little on air filter but not enough to matter. overall works perfect.
B001BX79TK|2|I had to return these as they were made of metal and it would eventually cause my tire stems to seize up.
B00247K7FK|5|love them!
B007CN9IJW|2|Very difficult to get off and on both parts of the seatbelt for the desired purpose. They work once you do that but it's a struggle and more trouble than it's worth.
B00JXNK1Z4|1|They are cute but not user friendly. They don't stay on the seats and are very complicated to put on.
B004IVGA0G|5|Perfect
B000F6F99G|5|This was the perfect solution for our 2-car garage. We don't have a lot of extra space, so getting the cars in just enough was challenging. Not anymore! Easy install and it just works. Also very easy to adjust.
B00684TAYY|2|Everything was fine, easy to program, etc. Until my car started unlocked by itself or another car's signal would set it off and unlock my car! Scary to think it was just unlocking by itself at any time
B0027AEW0U|5|Great product!
B00G620ZVU|5|Comes exactly as pictured and is bright. EXTREMELY BRIGHT!!!! A MUST-HAVE FOR EVERY VEHICLE!
B009BEGV6S|5|I had a question about the sensor's EEZtire could not have been more helpful. I just returned from a 3000 mile trip everything worked great.
B000CPA8B4|5|Works great, but I walked into Autozone and they have the same product available over the counter for I a couple bucks less. Check them out, if you need it quik.
B00F0CILM2|5|Just what I needed well made  would buy again.
B00HP94L3Q|5|Worker perfectly for my 2013 charger. Doesn't include screws.
B00HVHFGOU|5|Good fit helps keep key fob safe if you drop it a lot
B00EQ26FPW|5|beautiful.  exactly what I wanted
B004INIUQ6|5|Great product, very easy to install.
B00I6ZOZQG|4|Purchased this to use a turn a dash signal indicator on my ATV/UTV that I made street legal. It is much brighter than the previous lights that I tried. However, one of the wires pulled out while I was trying to get the retainer nut started. I'm thinking it was more my fat hands in a small space that is more to blame than the equipment. I will add some kind of adhesive where the wires go into the light body with the replacement light.
B000C9FLH6|5|These plugs were within 1-2 cm of the length of the OEM plugs.  The engine started up on the first crank after replacement.  You can't ask for anything more than that.
B00CQH23VO|5|Great product.  Comes with multiple mounting options, which was very helpful.  An advantage of this style of mount is that it easily comes off the bike with when not in use and other RAM products can be used.
B009S94NX4|5|Fit and look EXACTLY like oem covers.
B0009IQZH0|5|good
B00D9C2CDO|5|Works great I used tie down straps cris crossed over it and drove through a rain storm nothing for wet. Great product
B0023VKV94|3|Received it cracked C.S. fixed issue Great C.S.
B00QK4S1X8|4|ok
B00AZOJB2O|5|These work better than the cheap version clips  found on eBay. Does the job. Easy to use.
B002YBKTRC|5|Happy with it
B0081ST4V4|4|Worked for removal of a OEM stereo cassette deck from a 1993 F-150.  Tool initial alignment with the holes was a bit short, but an easy fix with a slight bending of the prongs.  Once inserted it took a few tries to get the tabs to bend back and pull out the radio, but the tool did the job.
B0024NT250|5|Works great.
B003BZD03K|4|Attached it to the fresh water connection in the RV. Saves time and effort at every stop.
B000C44DFC|5|Fit my '94 Eclipse perfectly.
B00D3298A0|5|This floor mat is awesome! Its seems like it could fit any vehicle. It makes my car feel new and fresh. Im also all about heavy duty!! Great product, Great Seller.
B0007LL0CO|5|Installed this on my 2004 Jayco 29fbs and it works great. Just connected same colored wires together and that was it. 8/21/15
B00CD2R7A4|5|Installed in minutes. I really like the fact that they are lower profile and don't have a lot of protrusion out from the vehicle.  Form and function achieved.
B00CAY4TSI|5|Just what I needed at half the price.  And it is what they say it is . I have had my DR for 21 years and still going!!!!
B001JEIHAG|5|Everything Fine
B005V2JPAI|5|Easy to swap out. No problems.
B00L7TMDVC|5|Excellent
B00G258GPI|5|Worked great! used about 3 gallons of propane with it on high for two nights in the cold sierras. About 10 hours total. It was nice to have a fire when California is on fire and under fire restrictions. So no open campfires. Sure we will be using it more and more.
B004A30UHG|5|Worked perfect.  Saved my camping trip.
B001CO182C|5|Excellent.
B002692308|5|Looks like, feels like, fits like an OEM product.
B00GYHUDVE|5|Love the sell of the squash. The bottle lasted awhile but of course depends on how much you use and how often you spray. was not defective.
B00B3WD1IW|5|perfect fit on my M3
B001D1Z85C|5|Excellent Product
B00E5NZ9OU|5|Makes my bike looks really great!
B004UVKV8G|5|A+
B00BVQ5S3Q|5|This door lock actuator was the exact replacement for my 2001 Ford F150 used on the driver's side door!!
B00DWVN08I|5|Guys, I don't understand why they specify specific models to attach this cap. This cap will fit into any 2&#34; hitch. I bight this to close the hitch I got installed from uhaul on my Toyota Sienna 2015 model. It fits well. I will update the review if it doesn't perform good over time, at least couple of years  is my expectation!
B007XB3GWS|2|this product don't work.
B00SGX8UEG|5|Looks awesome!
B000FIXQXK|5|Awesome Product & Super Fast Shipping!! Excellent Packing!!!!! Thank you!!!!!
B000CJ23SQ|5|item as described
B00K6974EU|1|Unhappy with this product. This product well made in China and shipping from China Post. Shipping was fast than what I think! But I'm extreme unhappy with this product because one led felt like loose also, used like 2 days and it blew my two fuses. Relay and &#34;Panel&#34; cost me $20 for Relay. This product cost $3.75. Cost me $20 for repair fuses..<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend you to get this item! Its not worth to blew your fuses!
B000B8JUNY|5|5 STAR!
B00HZCKGAK|5|Exactly the same color as the factory paint. Helped us save some body shop fees.
B00ECVMOIY|5|They are awesome.  They are my new headlights on my 4 wheeler. Super bright.
B00UZSXVQW|5|Works as advertised
B001RLU0RY|5|This is the only plug that I use in my boat.
B000VU7NL8|5|Heavy...fits like a glove!
B000EFOZQG|5|These are awesome, but be careful to snap on in the area that it has the area that needs to snap in.  I hit it too hard and it cracked, because i did not hit the right spot
B000CMF2PY|5|I totally love this Wing Nut .It really is a Great addition to a chrome air cleaner and is a Whole lot easier to turn than a standard wing nut. You will probably need a longer stud for it to fit. I screwed it onto the stud then measured and cut the universal stud i bought at the same time the same length as my previous stud. The fit is perfect. The Proform wing nut does add a little height to the air cleaner but does fit under the tight fitting hood on my 79 corvette.
B0074FR3UE|5|worked as should
B0031I1ZSE|5|Love it. It fits my Suzuki 420.
B000F38RJI|4|It's fits .
B004SNJPV0|5|perfect fit
B00T7Z66L6|5|perfect love it
B00BTL8NDA|5|Works and looks great
B00BS3DJCO|4|Turned out like new.  Sold the bike for over double what I paid for it.  The paint certainly helped.  Prep is the key.<br /><br />It's about 8 dollars price too high or I would have given 5 stars.
B003RGIWO0|5|stopped a leak in the plastic housing of my radiator. Leak was a steady drip. sealed it while I watched, within 15 minutes.
B00VB2OCDM|1|I am in the process of returning this.. I was gone for one week and the tie holders càme off, as well as the cover was too small, kept blowing off fromthe front.  when I ordered it they said it would fit my car, I gave them all the info about the car, but the cord barley went under the car to lock it.So I will be trying to send it back, we will see how they stand behind their merchandise. Otherwise it would have been a good cover.
B002P2TWNM|5|Just the height I needed for my trailer when I camp in soft sand instead of concrete. Makes a difference trying to get enough height when hooking up.
B0012H6HMK|5|I love these cute little lights!
B00BC7P0Q4|5|Super easy to install, all you have to do is remove the adhesive backings and press down, so do not fall for dealer traps by paying them money to install them. They add a touch of luxury and class to my 2014 Accord EX-L and are easier to clean than the door sill was before they were installed.
B00QF0LO3G|5|Real Metal Chrome. Very good quality. Once placed you can't remove and adjust, so this is a good thing as it shows that it will stay securely stuck to my vehicle. IT does use 3M outdoor double stick tape. These are of great quality. Will update if durability changes.
B00B8KBNDY|1|Although the product indicated it would for my 2014 sonata. The lights were not the system style as what's in my car. The delivery was timely.
B00BCNN5J2|4|Real metal Chrome emblem. Good quality. Hard to place though. Just get someone experienced to place it.
B00AC6XRDE|4|Great saddle bags. Very practical. Zippers are suspect. Having difficulty already when zipping all the way down. Zipper sticks. Cannot zip all the way down is my solution...
B00BTLII9O|5|cool stuff<br />cool beans
B0030EVL60|4|It works.  However,  behind the pictures they show you and behind the aluminum otc badging,  is basically a bunch of copper tubing you could get at a hardware store for fifty cents.  The valve is just an air compressor regulator that feels like it's from harbor freight.  The blow molded case doesn't fit well and everything is just lose in it.  Overall,  not impressed with quality for the price.  But at least it works.
B00RA84LOG|5|Looks great on my 2015 gsxr 750. Would recommend to a friend.
B008N69C7U|5|Works great
B00Z8YTFQS|5|Works great. Price is right. Now I need to order a few more for my other motorcycles.
B0096QYZ8M|5|saved a fortune. If you are handy at welding then even more money is saved
B00NGJEN5K|2|I ordered the tent on wednesday night. It arrived timely (about 2 hours ago). Upon opening the package, the Top Tent Pole was already broken/separated. And so I will be returning the item for a refund.
B004I14SF0|5|Very good it's perfect
B00BTSJ29C|5|Very good price. Worked very good after having key cut from a locksmith.
B001TJXWH4|5|EVERYTHING Chemical Guys make are awesome. My cars / trucks shine and sparkle with each product I use.
B003O9R7LE|5|Looks beautiful, attractive piece
B007O5GWV0|5|After looking at all the reviews, I purchased this one. I only used it on once on a camping trip and so far it worked perfect. I have a Chevy 1500 with a 350 cubic inch engine. My RV Trailer is 3200 lbs. I am happy with my purchase.
B00U3HYMR2|3|Nice way of protecting the key fob for my keyless CX-5 ignition.  The leather/lacing is nice and looks like it will last a long time.  Just be advised that you will have to finish the sewing after you put your fob into the case.  Therefore it will not come back out unless you cut into it.  It comes with plenty of extra lacing and the sewing needle.  If you don't have any experience with sewing or leather-work lacing it might pose a challenge.  And - I have tried three times to post this review and Amazon refuses to post it - will see if this one gets posted.  One thing I did not like is that the item ships from China and takes weeks to arrive ... they say up to a month.  Mine arrived within two weeks - so not an issue.  Just wish it had been spelled out a little clearer - the item might have been available somewhere else in the states.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Needs a better switch
B000GROIYG|3|Did the trick on my 7/8&#34; bars. The 1&#34; with rubber fillers that came with the windshield kept slipping. Too bad they make you purchase the additional set instead of sending them with the windshield.
B00EF3P63O|2|Scratched up from shipping, more assembly required than expected.
B0023V99II|5|perfect fit
B00BYH6C1E|5|Excellent product.  This was a tight fit in my car. The seats are kind of &#34;winged&#34;, and I thought it might not fit, but I just pushed the gap filler a little further down below the &#34;wing&#34; of the seat and that did the trick. My advice would be to not expect this device to be flush with the seat. push it down below the level of the seat about 2 inches.  Whatever falls onto it, can still be reached (like I said, two inches) with your hand. The big gap by the seat belt buckle is also filled up pretty nicely. The product is well made with good materials. Not flimsy. Car makers should just incorporate this into their cars, really.  But until then, this product does the trick.
B00CJJ86RY|5|perfect fit
B00KRIDE5I|5|I have had this item installed in my 2011 Mustang now for just over three weeks.  My impressions (and recommendations):  1) It lends a neater appearance to the engine compartment, as it replaces the factory intake tube, with it's ugly and restrictive resonance  chambers.  2) Due to it not having those resonance chambers, the Airaid M.I.T allows more induction noise to reach the cabin, giving the Cyclone V6 a slighter throatier intake growl.  3) While you're installing the M.I.T, please follow Airaid's directions and disconnect the battery for 10-20 minutes before starting the engine.  This ensures that you have cleared the ECM's memory, and have forced it to learn a new &#34;strategy&#34;.  Allow the engine to idle until it achieves full operating temp, then take the car out and drive it as you would normally.  I did not follow those steps, and as a result, it took the ECM on its own about 2 weeks to perform a learn with the M.I.T in place.  4) My highway mileage went up about 1 MPG after the learn, and throttle response is just a hair sharper, allowing for a bit more passing ability at part throttle (below 3000 RPM).  5) At full throttle, you won't really feel any real improvement until you are over 5000 RPM or so.
B0000BYQ8U|5|It is attached to the boat, I can see both skiers and any boats that may be gaining on me
B000BZAAJK|5|Best bearings for my vehicle
B005EHNDHQ|5|Very high quality decal that truly encapsulates the majestic grace of this fine french breed while simultaneously posing an esoteric question.
B000U0Z2L2|2|Unfortunately, this product pops out of my 2012 Volvo's two 12V power outlets.  The springy, side contacts are high enough on the male end that they push the whole thing up and out as soon as I let go.  I haven't had this problem with my Garmin, my dash cam, power inverter, and various iPhone power adapters.  Perhaps it would work in a true &#34;cigarette lighter&#34;, which might be deeper than the modern &#34;power ports&#34;.  For me and my car, it was a waste of money.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the build quality seems good, and it is fused.  Some commenters have said it isn't--perhaps they got an older version of the product.
B00383YM8W|5|Very good product.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|It is exactly what it says it is, a very large sun shade.  Works great for my Ram 1500.
B002CXCNQC|5|sounds great (it is loud tho but not overbearing)  fit was perfect on my 15 Evo love it
B00CFJT6AE|5|My check engine light in my Audi A4 came on a few days ago. I used Blue Driver (sold here on Amazon) to scan the ODB-II and got two errors back: P2279 Intake air system leak and P2187 System  too lean at idle bank 1. I used Google to figure out what they might mean in layman's English. All the results pointed me to this product as the best fix for the money. The internet was right.<br /><br />Update July 30, 2016: Still working perfectly.<br /><br />Update October 1, 2015: This part has been doing its job perfectly for 30 days and I'm still happy to have saved the money.<br /><br />For the price, this product simply can't be beat. I would have spent $350 at an Audi dealer to solve my check engine light problem. It took me about ten minutes to install the replacement part. The old part, once off, definitely had a seal issue. This replacement fit perfectly. I am not a mechanic and I was able to install this sucessfully using two flathead screwdrivers. I'll update my review once I have had the part installed for a few months.<br /><br />I used blue driver to clear the codes 30 miles ago and the vechicle is running perfectly. The codes haven't returned.<br /><br />Update: April 27, 2016 - This product is still doing the job. No issues so far.
B00GCAX24I|5|exelente producto

B00T6IWAY6|5|Was in Perfect conditions
B009UODIL0|5|Perfect fit great up gain
B0013TNFEA|5|Worked great after I cleaned the carburetor too
B001OMVCIC|5|Great product follow the instructions and roll it like a hot dog for easy install. Put them in my ram tradesman 2014 and can tow my boat without the tail swag from the coils using 30 psi. I do recommend deflating to 10psi when not towing or you may loose a bit of traction :) save your tires and deflate.
B000C9S2J0|5|Fit perfectly. A few years back I bought another cap. I can't remember the reason for the previous purchase but the cap fit tight and it was difficult adding oil, if needed. The cap arrived in a timely manner and was at an affordable price and free delivery with Prime.
B000C31KQS|5|Filter works well with 2004 Kia Sorento.
B00CHT8MHA|5|This is a perfect fit for my 07 Fleetwood Pace Arrow.
B0036F593E|3|Small and cheap/fragile. Doesnt cover lower eye enough
B001THSTWY|5|Came fairly quick to when I ordered them. Installation took a little time but my jeep is looking brand new! The lights are very clear and bright. Definitely worth the price!
B00KLKC20K|5|Easy to. Change over like new the dealership wants $156 for one. I did two for less than $10.oo.
B00VEW34LU|5|Very Good Quality.
B003P9USIM|5|Works
B00ZZGE4LU|1|Couldn't even use it once before the terminal clamp snapped in half. The plastic for these is very cheap and not strong at all.<br />No review on any other part of it though.
B002OW5J44|5|Easy to install and they cover the roof vents great. No rain entered on our first  trip out with the pair I Installed. These tinted ones still let light through very well Id recommend them to fellow RV owners
B004QHGQA6|5|2003 highlander worked well I recomend using Toyota seals inboard and out for best results . Not easy to replace on all wheel drive model but that's what I have. Speed Sensor on spindle was frozen in place by rust. I was able to leave sensor in and work around it.
B000C2E9SA|5|They're head bolts, just make sure you match up the lengths of the old ones.
B008EFTSTC|3|thought they would have been bigger but good product for the price
B00LPYP0BO|4|So far so good
B001REV9CG|5|Great product.  Easy on hands with good cleaning power.
B008Y31MZM|4|Must add rubber sleeve from old one before install. Not an easy task to do. Should come with one already
B0007VANJK|5|Easily installed, and high quality product.
B0038F8SYE|5|My husband loves this stool. He needed something on wheels especially when he is waxing our vehicles.
B002CX5MZQ|5|Awesome.  Better then microfiber!
B008F07OMO|5|It came in a good amount of time and was a good fit
B004PX8BC2|1|Very disappointed in this product. I bought this particular jack to keep in my RV for any potential side of the road tire changes. The first time I used it to jack an axle up, the threads scored like it was cross threaded. I made certain to pick up a jack that had the rating I needed (axle rating is 2540lbs), but this one is obviously not going to cut it.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|It is rare in this world of &#34;Junk&#34; in which we live that anything meets my expectations anymore. In the case of the TMH 120W my expectations have been exceeded. This thing is WELL BUILT. And it will impress you when you light it up. I have only used it once but so far so good. The fins on the back are the heat sink. It dissipates the heat very well. LED's in singular form don't draw many AMPs but this array has 20 very intense LED's and is pulling close to 10 amps, so there is some warmth involved, but not much. I hand held the light for 20 or so minutes and it never became uncomfortable. This is a LOT of bang for the buck.
B000OR18BE|4|Works very well but the drain hose had to holes in in. No response from Amazon to correct this problem.
B00GYI1YCK|3|They did not fit my HOnda CRV front and rear seat.  The back, cargo size, is great, though.
B001MU5LNS|4|SEEMS TO BE WORKING PERFECTLY IN MY SPEED6

B00KTJ7IGQ|5|It worked great!!  Received in a timely manner.  Very satisfied!!
B0097BFM06|5|Love these gloves. Works perfect with sinks with flow sensors. So you can wash them off without removing them.

B00KTIUG5C|5|Perfect. Fast ship. Good instruction sheet.
B0007N20GM|2|No suction on one of the suction cups.
B00A82L92I|4|It didn't fit the generator despite the description which said it would.  Very disappointed.
B00K6C28DO|5|Very nice, especially during the night.
B009DJVMBK|5|Easy job, right fit for 2004 caddy.
B00MIJQL7C|3|The color is not a muted silver - like a grayish, rustic tone. It's bright silver, so please know that before purchasing. The bright silver/chrome does not match well with our all black Jeep, with black and gray wheels. The brightness also takes away from the inflections. These plate holders look like jewelry - &#34;bling.&#34;  It is metal - albeit cheap metal. They are a bit large as well, though fit the front and back. Overall, it's fine and I believe the color will age and if it doesn't I'll probably paint them a flat black. For the price, not bad.
B00I8SJPPW|5|Sounds great. Easy to install. Shipped quick. Love the look on my cb500f.

B000NPDL76|5|Works just as advertised. Easy!
B008QY8K1S|5|***UPDATE***  At first, when stalling, it would look like it's waaaay to hard to close and too tight, but give it a few days, it will take the shape and will be like it was to open.. Very easy.. The installatibg was a PAIN in the ass though, but other than that, it looks great, recomended. Here are pics of it on the miata.
B005CDNCQO|5|Excellent
B00BTGDR9A|2|pads fall apart pretty easy, and could potentially cause someone to damage their car.
B00HHFHUM2|5|Easy bolt on kit would buy it again
B00C42SSYM|5|Work great
B00065JM8U|4|The air flow is incredibly strong even on the low setting. Only caveat is you must screw-mount it to dashboard or wood base,<br />but it can not be clipped / attached / glued (its too heavy anyway). Since its 12V based, and I didn't want a permanent alteration to my car,<br />it was not as useful as I had hoped it would be.
B005JPJMI2|5|This stuff is amazing.
B005F5QD9C|5|Fits perfectly! Help to support my back in long rides and on bump roads i dont have the feeling of me kidneys jumping around!
B009QLFJA0|5|Very nice and received before the designated date.
B000WPUG8E|5|Excellent bag, holds a ton, stays on at 85 mph, seems plenty tough. It's not waterproof but they never claimed it was, so that's just an observation not a complaint.  I'm very satisfied.
B00AQAQI6E|4|Some worked and some didn't. But the ones that did I get a lot of compliments of how how bright they are.
B00BITIMIO|5|Great product
B000C7QGTA|5|fits perfect no problems or leaks
B00AM1SBBM|5|They fit perfectly! I was a lil surprised honestly considering the price! good stuff

B007XZK5M8|5|A huge must if you two or have a dually. My dually had these small tiny mirrors that I couldn't see around my fenders let alone behind my 26 foot long enclosed landscaping trailer. Got these and they are awesome I couldn't be happier
B00EC2CKW8|4|they work great.
B0046I3I8I|3|These are cheap covers that do the job.  They are canvas material.  I have replaced them with better quality tire covers,  I was having issues of them getting extremely dirty from grease, tire shine, dirt, storage, etc.
B00L9J6NU2|1|While applying the vinyl to aluminum item the vinyl does not adhere and slowly peels off. I tried 3M comply material without an issue. It appears the VViViD product lacks the aggressive adhesion.
B004UQFV1I|3|good products
B00LNBHNQE|1|It was the wrong part and ended up causing the rest of my electrical system to fail, and now my bike won't run at all. The part fit the same models in other years, but not my year.
B00BTLEIIY|1|I have a 2007 Saturn VUE, the seat covers are so loose and baggy, The backseats cover does not work at all. They did not take into account the seat belts that are built it. The front seats: the bottom seat is not to bad but the back of the seat is very baggy. There is not way to snug it up. There are no straps for tightening, it slips over the back and if its loose than its just loose. I guess I should not expect a lot for being a cheap cover.
B00B2Q0YV6|5|Exactly as described and fast shipping
B00A82A3RK|5|Perfect match for my Instant Start. Fast delivery will be back
B0047DGTIS|5|Yes perfect fit, thanks for saving me money, the same product would have cost me 100 dollars more locally
B000COS07O|5|Works great to lock the wheels on my 2004 Dodge Ram
B000IYILDG|5|Some say this Wix filter doesn't fit thr MX-5, but that has not been my experience. I've used 2 on my 2006, and I put one my sister's 2008. It is a tight fit, but that's a good thing since it means dirty air can't flow around the edges. Just be sure to put it in right side up and pull the airbox closed and hold it there before trying snap the latches down.
B00V5B3PT6|1|The ring is too large for the BMW Logo.  This does not have a nice clean fit and as a result the 3M tape doesn't hold.  A good buy for the price but a complete redesign is needed.  Fellow Amazon buyers save your money until this is improved.<br /><br />Also - take a close look at the picture and notice the gap between the aluminum ring and the BMW logo because its obvious very once you install it.
B0087NB1IW|5|Very happy, install was challenging,  but not too hard. Set up is easy, controls are easy to use, sound quality is pretty good. Very nice item
B0002NIKMK|4|Looks great but it'll take time to show is durability. Brushed steel plate design with plastic backing doesn't feel like it'll last long. Looks awesome though and I'm willing to test it.
B0002NUO6K|5|This is the best adhesive remover I've used and it doesn't affect a painted finish.
B00D318N8O|5|As with all good quality decals, it is difficult to get on the vehicle if you don't have the experience placing stickers. However this is a very good quality REFLECTIVE American flag sticker.
B001O77CMW|5|Better than my givi and much less in cost. Only complaint/observation, the attaching cords to the lid which prevent the kid from opening to far could be higher quality but wow I am very impressed with this case and its overal quality. The price is outstanding. Also includes a backrest!
B01092I9LA|5|I have received my seat covers and l am complettly satisfy
B00BZODG9W|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then they are good to purchase.
B000H5WRPO|5|Perfectly fit the pneumatic tire on my garden cart. No flat so far!
B002GQEZH0|3|To small for real engines.
0715000322|5|Wish I got these years ago!
B00TJEZRH4|4|My husband was well pleased with his 3pc Diesel Injector Puller. It gets the job done and comes in very handy. They are well made so they will be around for awhile. Like the saying goes you get what you pay for. So if you looking for a 3pc Diesel Injector Puller look know futher.
B00BJ7ZXLY|5|Perfect!
B00ZR51DSG|5|AUTHENTIC! Work perfectly! Thanks!
B00BN6C1M0|5|Worked for my DSC security system.
B00XBXNCI0|5|I ordered this for my dad to put on his club car golf cart. I was tired of watching him ride at night sticking a flashlight out of the side. He was super excited and so was I. I highly recommend this light because it is the best value and it comes with a wiring harness. He wants to oder another one for his pontoon boat.
B009XU8W6W|1|I only gave a 1 star because I had to in order to write a review.  Terrible. Would never order here again.
B00G620ZVU|5|These lights are very, very bright I bolted them to one of the roof rack bars on my truck and they are brighter than my headlights and shine farther and clearer. Definitely would buy again.
B00PANW6K4|5|got it for someone else love it
B006DYNVTE|5|my 2013  honda civic si had DENSO plugs.  I replaced them with the NGK and the idle problems and high RPM mis fire went away.
B000QJNA7A|1|After only 6 months the rotor is shot. Sadly it looks worse than the one that I replaced, which provided years of service.
B004VKR5SK|5|The filter was a perfect fit and easy to install.  The quality looked better than the Fram filter I had in there but at half the price.  I'm very happy.
B0021KVFG0|4|easy to install
B00TEJJ9IW|4|Great looking decal! Love the look of it. The small center pieces in the mouth area were a little hard to get on and one of the leg bones tore a bit on instillation (could have been user error). Love the look on the back of my Burgman scooter, makes me think of it as a speeder bike from Return Of The Jedi.
B00YMTH6FW|5|worked great thanks
B001G4Z5J0|4|Perfect for my camper!
B0044GB6MM|5|For the Money you just can beat it! quick easy in and out install in under a hour. works great! I have a 99 F150 extended cab
B004MZLS8W|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE SWAY BARS!!!!
B0012TRKGA|3|flimsy but works, just be careful installing it
B003USYN6Q|4|Not a fan of the smell but it cleans the leather pretty well
B006QH55YM|5|I'm using this as my starting and deep cycle battery on a 17' Key West center console fishing boat.  It's several years old now and still works like new.  When not in use, I keep it attached to a PulseTech Xtreme Charge, which is one of the best for maintaining a battery and prolonging its life.  Lower self-discharge than the cheap marine batteries one finds at Walmart.
B00MXC2A2Y|5|Sons first motorcycle shoes.  He loves them.  The hold up well and he will likely buy the same ones if these ever need replacing
B004Y4R0MY|5|Bought this coupled with a hayden 205 thermo unit for my 1980 Scirocco as I am a go fast junkie on a budget. Drastically reduced my oil temps and did not raise or lower my oil pressure!!
B000CGFHBY|5|OEM part, 10 minute installation.  Check engine light gone.<br />If you have a GM product with a recurring CEL for mass air flow censor, check for vacuum leaks, then replace this part.  It's a fairly common failure item.
B00AYSV4O4|3|Looks cheap up close.
B001AWIHHK|5|I like
B004PBXU3O|5|Nice add on to the bike
B00FU8PORG|5|Great product
B007VDQXNM|5|Look to be the same quality as the stock ones on the truck. Good product!
B00MVMMIA0|5|If you want bright light, these are the bulbs to buy, they are of the yellow color instead of the white light, but they are pleasant to the eye and I was not disappointed one bit, I would highly recommend them....
B00KTHVBW0|5|I have a 2000 Honda Accord SE V6 and this is a perfect fit! I couldn't be happier!!
B0042LHNV2|1|Lasted less than two months. Now it will not charge, would not buy again.
B00Y5HFJ5A|1|Sorry, let me edit my first review.<br />This item will fit h22a engines and looks great but you can't have your ignition wires hooked up at the same time. So it's a tough decision, be able to dive my vehicle or have the valve cover look a little better... Hmmmmmmm what to pick.
B006K8WCYS|1|This does not work on ford big blocks. Though nowhere in the product details does it mention that its a Small Block Chevy ONLY tool. Frustrated to the point of no end. Another waste of time.
B0066RE1W4|4|It came in the Expansion Tanks I was also replacing. Always good to have a spare though.
B0053ZAIYU|1|One was soppose to be white but both are red so it sucks
B0045K2Q9Y|5|good product
B00COYNZJ8|5|Awesome product. First and of course you will not convince anybody the star wars crew is actually in you car and nor is this really intended to. It is good enough to get a chuckle or a &#34;that's pretty cool&#34; comment, which is all I really needed.<br /> 5 stars.
B004EIAADG|3|First 3 months awesome for only using 6 or 7 times to charge phone tab etc. Jump started a few vehicles no issue. Less than a year later and not good. Follow all charging and use by the manual. The pump for both auto and inflatables is a joke. Makes weird noises when charging. Would pay a fair price for one with 2000 peak amps and same features that function longer than a year. Make the pump stronger.
B001GJ3EJS|2|I was expecting the bristles to me a bit more stiff. I found myself mashing the brush onto surfaces to get any real cleaning power. Wound up finding exactly the kind of stiffer brush (without being too stiff) at the home depot.<br /><br />If you're looking for a soft brush, get this. If not, look elsewhere.
B00BBWJ16U|5|Love the smell and it makes the alcantara look alive again
B0002MSY7C|5|excellant
B00JG0531G|5|Original equipment fit and easy to install (must remove the tires).  They look good and protect the paint from rocks, tar and dirt.
B00DTO6G9S|5|No complaints here so far, but to be fair I have not used it much since I got it. I tested it in the daytime and it is very bright. Nighttime brightness is excellent. Easy to install and use, once switched on the patterns will flash in alternating patterns unless set-not a problem for me it is easy to set or to just let it alternate patterns, either way people will notice you behind them. It seems to be brighter than the other ones at the firehouse. I plan on updating this review after a few months of use. Many states require you to have a permit to operate one of these, and it should only be used with extreme caution. Updated 09/29/2015-Still going strong and it is the envy of fellow volunteers-great light at a great price. The red light on the adapter does get hot after prolonged use, so be careful of that. Correction-the light will remember the last pattern you set, so if you find one you like you can keep using it by default, just set the pattern you like then shut it off. The next time you plug it in it will remember the pattern you used last. I used it in daytime and people notice it and pull out of the way. Updated 10/19/2015-still a great light, but the power indicator has blown out-not surprising considering how hot it would get. Difficult to tell if it is on or not in the daytime, thus I now have to keep it unplugged now. I will only update this review if something else breaks. Updated 02/21/2016 I purchased 2 more, 2 in front 1 in back, excellent product.
B00T4HF78A|5|Fast delivery,  product as they described
B0010GG7YG|5|like a glove and functions perfect.
B00KTIYXLU|5|worked great!
B000GHEZNK|1|I am returning this thing ASAP. It seems to be designed for usage only once and not good even once.
B00IEA2YF2|1|lasted about two months.  Absolute junk.  Cant get a response from Dura International about a warranty.  Do not buy
B000EH0ORI|5|Excellent tool, sure beats drinking gas!
B001O7PNNM|5|Good stuff!
B007YVOJZK|5|The lanyard came within 4 days of purchasing. Very nice but not the one in the picture above. It is missing the link in the lanyard that links it in a loop.
B008C373WU|2|Not bright
B005CNNIV8|5|I've had these in my 2014 Charger SE for about a year now and they have exceeded expectations.  They are a perfect fit, don't slide around, look nice with the black interior, and are easy to clean and reinstall.  I intended to use them only during the winter time, but like them so much that I've left them in all summer.
B000QIR2ZC|5|Good
B000A0EJ84|5|Fits perfectly for my 2004 Odyssey. Works great.
B005WXMF9O|5|Item as described, on time delivery, good price. What is not to like? Highly recommended.
B0045WBVUM|5|Very comfortable and glad there were straps to hold onto goldwing.  We had one previously for about 2 years and lost in recently because it must have fallen off the bike when I got off and I didn't notice.
B009X8KDCK|5|Great job.worked out just fine perfect fit. Will buy more
B00ONGZR00|5|Very good
B001OMKFQC|5|Exactly what I wanted!!
B00BGTPN3I|5|Perfect
B000C75PNI|5|Exactly what we needed.
B00EC0YMJE|1|As a previous reviewer noted, the heating element studs do not fit the properly.  I also cannot get the entire backing piece to stay attached to the car.  I'm disappointed because I bought the right side replacement a year ago and it was a quick fix.
B000WK111K|5|Great stuff - turned the &#34;Grey&#34; of my Harley motor and inner primary into Showroom Black again in only 5 minutes. Please note that this also works great on turning grey rubber and plastic back to black as well as metal. So you can use it on rubber hoses, plastic car-bumpers, and on sun faded rubber around car windows. It turned the grey on a sun-faded Jeep showroom black again!
B00IT5GU3Y|5|it was a perfect fit, good quality and great price.
B00BTK5W3U|5|There isn't't any glare with these lights, and they don't get hot.
B00G6KGPFM|5|It works just like it is advertised,  I will buy more for additional projects
B00G6JYV22|5|Feels good when you have gloves on. I would buy again for next bike or all bikes. Label starting to come off. But don't care. Blue hasn't faded. Key is still good
B001AZK1VC|2|didn't fit, gave to a friend. he loves them
B00UES159I|5|good
B00C7G49Z2|5|Very nice
B00EC8XBHU|4|I like the lights but they were broken
B0001MQ7EK|5|Works well
B002RSIK4G|5|Awesome stuff.  Bought more than needed, but have already found other uses for it.
B00BEBCL8S|5|Good
B00E7WEFQ2|5|These are great, if you are into that sort of thing. Fortunately my daughter is, and this went on her car. The installation was easy, they are quite durable, and definitely look cute on her car. She is no speed demon, but they hold up to freeway speeds just fine.
B00II8HJZA|4|Fits as it should, does not have a camera hole.
B000O5EW9G|1|DO NOT BUY this Bucket. The handle will pull off and not stay in the holes after a few uses.
B004OFNJZ0|4|These folding sunshades are colorful and easy to set up and store. Helps keep the inside of my BMW cooler and spares my leather seats from the harsh heat of the sun.  Glad my co-worker told me about them.
B001H1O688|5|Fits and Works perfectly.  First Rate Ford Quality.
B000X25JJW|5|Fixes like a glove and looks very nice.
B00EA3MS9O|4|nice
B0002JN2EU|5|Prices better at Walmart. Product works well
B000AMXT4W|5|They hold true and yrs later still do. Just dap alil glue to keep it on when you open and shut car doors.
B000BZEQUE|5|Fast shipping! Great quality product
B000B8VWP8|5|Perfect match!
B001HRIRRI|5|Excellent.
B0010EB6QW|5|This is the first time I replaced theses filters. It was easy and took about 15 minutes. All I needed was a Phillips screwdriver. Six screws and the glove box was out. One clip held the filters in place. Pulled the old ones out and vacuumed the opening. Lots of leaves! Put the new filters in. Fit well. Put the glove box back on and I was done.<br />Filters work great and the air smells cleaner.<br />Going to replace these now 1 X a year since it was easy and cheap.
B000K9XTPE|5|Go TEXANS!!!!!! This is are year baby. This is a great hitch cover for any diehard Texan fan to show of there spirit. One thing I highly recommend is also buying a Deadbolt Hitch Lock, well worth it and not that expensive. I slapped this on the back of my white f-150 and it looks sweet. It cleans up the back of my truck cause you no longer see the rusty, dirty looking hitch anymore. Love it. Now I need to go find a Astros and Rockets one.
B0071EYS2E|5|Bought if for my motorcycle key... which I had previously left in the ignition a few times while out and about. (cringe)  I haven't made that mistake again since pairing the key with this handy reminder!  It's also kinda clever looking for sport-bikes that do indeed &#34;FLY&#34; so-to-speak.
B00XZ9NJTC|5|Worked as described, cost me roughly $6-7 to have a &#34;locksmith&#34; cut the key from my original one. Went to my Vue unlocked the door and followed included instructions to program, same started right up! Would highly recommend
B000QIH3C4|3|Had a small coolant leak and had to add a quart or so every month. I am always hesitant to add &#34;Sealer&#34; to any system . But after not finding the leak , dropped 2 tablet in and so far so good. Have not had to add any for 6 weeks.
B001Y91CRQ|5|this has best bang for the buck.
B00NEL7NY8|5|Excellent.
B000W7DBWA|5|Easy to install and very practical to have on my RV compartments.  Would highly recommend.
B008FCE8IA|5|Great price perfect fit.
B005HFYE1O|5|5 40amp relays and harnesses couldn't beat this deal
B00W8LQEEA|1|It's crap. Two of the rain guards came off on the highway. The adhesive is still stuck to the car but the rain guards are gone
B00CH6T18C|5|Best cleaning product for leather.
B00EOUGRR2|5|Excellent
B008IJH904|5|i tried cleaning the old one first and only had a little bit of improvement. this carb is cheap and should of done it sooner, real old blower running damn near new.
B00REJXL88|2|The handle on the passenger side would never get tight & bent the first time I opened it.  The cover itself was really good, but the handles on the tailgate are not good.
B00KMFV246|5|Got this to keep in my car.
B00CDGNX26|4|as described
B00II3SE40|5|Bulbs are nice and bright and use less energy. 1/3 the price of RV dealer.
B000CQHWSK|5|Perfect fit!!
B000JFHNQA|1|Every single car dealership I've worked at use this product. The reason I bought this was because the other day I had to have AAA come out to jump my vehicle and they were also using it. I've had a lot of experience using this and I've never had one issue. A vehicle I own(not the one AAA jumped) has been sitting in my driveway for a few years mainly because I have another vehicle to drive. Recently I tried jumping it with another vehicle and it just didn't want to start. I connected the booster pack and the vehicle started right up.<br /><br />A year or so later.....<br /><br />Thankfully I haven't had to use this more than four times. Then last night I decided that since it's getting cooler I should make sure it's charged for the winter since I hadn't touched it since March. I pressed the status button and it was dead. So I plugged it in and came back every hour or so and it never said the charge was complete. Eventually I ended up leaving it plugged in over night. The next morning the charge compete light still wasn't on. I unplugged it to see if it was charging and it had no charge at all.
B004VJ39AO|5|First, this review is in regards to an install on a 2005 Scion XB Automatic so I can't speak to the clutch switch.<br /><br />This thing, amazingly, works as advertised!  That said, this should not be attempted by someone unless they at least have a basic understanding of cars and/or electronics (but any shop should be able to do it if you're not able to).  It took me quite a bit longer than other reviewers, although I feel like most of the time was in the removal of panels and fishing wire harnesses.  I did not remove my driver's seat but that likely would have saved me some time (and certainly neck-ache) in the end.  The hardest part for me was fishing the wire harness through the firewall, but that is largely because I already had a 0 AWG power cable coming through for my car stereo which made things way tighter.  Other that, I can't imagine installation being any easier considering what you are accomplishing.  As others have noted, the directions could be more clear and CERTAINLY a color copy would be nice since low resolution AND black & white aren't typically the best combination.<br /><br />That said, the pinouts are accurate if you know how to read pinouts and are familiar with pin numbering (the OEM connectors actually have a few pin numbers printed on them if you look carefully) and the T-taps are sufficient (there are only 3 necessary for the automatic transmission).<br /><br />As others have said, it doesn't hold speed perfectly, particularly on inclines but that is mentioned in the documentation and is likely unavoidable with this type of setup and the fact that the XB engine struggles on hills to begin with.  I would call this a non-problem in general as long as you're aware of it.<br /><br />Finally, and the reason I'm giving this 5 stars instead of 4 for the lacking instructions, is the great customer service from Rostra.  During the course of the install I managed to break the yellow retaining bar on the main unit wiring harness through no fault ofthe product.  I emailed Rostra and was quickly asked for my shipping address so they could send me a replacement free of charge.  Gotta love that!
B009JHPALY|5|Had all I needed for my repair. No need for me running back and forth to the parts stores to find the right sizes.<br />Did the seal repair on my vehicles TXV Block Valve at the firewall.
B001KS872E|5|Somone had stolen our driver side mirror while on vacation so I ordered replacement glass. Great product, fast shipping! Just ordered the wrong part for the purpose.
B005CO9FDW|5|Works as advertised.
B0066SD3RM|5|Good hose. At a reasonable price far below the dealer thieves.
B00PQZPMYI|3|No what I expected. But good for the price. I guess.
B004WMDXRE|5|So easy to install. Incredibly affordable. Absolutely worth it.
B00LQHR9GE|5|Cree lights and all worked
B00D5RATL0|4|product is just as advertised.
B000C822PQ|5|Fit my 1995 Tracker perfectly!  I will try and not leave this one at the gas station ha
B00G5ORYKO|4|good deal
B000IYELWG|4|Seemed to be a quality part and I have always trusted the Timken name.  Comes with the ABS sensor so makes for a much easier installation.
B003P9US2I|5|Excellent.
B009T9O99G|5|This is the first product I have ever used for my car that did what it was advertised too do.<br />I bought the small bottles to test. I am very please with the product.
B00U8RP7T4|5|I bought a replacement mirror for my husband's car a few weeks (months) ago and I've been putting on installing it because I didn't realize I need to take the door panel off until after I'd already ordered the mirror. Needless to say I was very happy to find these tools.<br /><br />From the pictures and description I expected them to be metal, but they aren't. They are a nice thick solid plastic like material. Initially I was a little put off by the plastic until I realized the plastic wouldn't scratch or break the car as much as metal would.<br /><br />They do not come with any type of directions for each tool, they are just in a standard brown box. I would have liked some direction on how to use them and how each piece can be best utilized, but I guess it's not that difficult to figure out how to use a pry bar.<br /><br />I am pleased with this set, they worked well getting the door panel off.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.
B000B5ZM6Q|4|Fast shipping great product. Seams to be great quality
B00GXRGY9U|3|havent installed yet. did a dry fit and they seem to be a looser fit than should be. am debating if i want to install them.
B00DSD7GJE|5|Hulk say this good decal!!!!
B000CPAOHM|5|Okay I went to my local parts store they wanted $275 for all the parts to make this. I found this for $120 and it worked perfectly and made my automatic to manual swap go so much smoother didn't have to bleed it just bolt it in place and was all set
B009S9RURU|5|Love it.
B00EOYL45S|5|You Mazda 6 owners know what I'm talking about. If you broke that cheap plastic T-fitting that runs into the throttle body when you were changing spark plugs....This is it.
B00D9HS9N6|5|Perfect fit and fast s/h A++
B00BITR8WU|5|This is the second replacement for my tailgate handle in the past 2 years.  The last time, I bought the Depo one (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CLQ3RQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) and was immediately struck at how cheap it felt.  Sure enough, it broke only a year or two later.  This one, even though more inexpensive, is higher quality--at least at first look.  I hope it will last longer.  The whole point of not buying the Toyota part is to save money, but if you have to buy multiple cheaper parts, then it doesn't really save money.
B003RM5AEY|1|It smelled horrible when we got it. It has fallen apart several times. Makes a person wonder if it really is DOT certified.
B002MW6HRO|5|perfect fit, just as advertised
B005TTZGSS|5|Worked great !!!!
B004D0AD32|5|Saved $100!
B00LJ7S5GY|4|had the shop put them on my 2015 KLR and they had to do some modifications to a couple of things that they should not have to do so 1 star off but as for me enjoying them on the bike i'm very happy.
B001KR1BQE|5|AAAA++++
B00HP95CZW|3|needs mounting hardware. or help with buying hardware. fit great. fast shipping.
B00BYWXMXU|3|I assume this is working, who knows. However it came coated in the slimiest oil substance ever.
B005SVXQS4|5|Works like a charm.
B0055SC45Q|5|Still checking it out, so far no complaints. My vehicle needs a shift kit so this fluid can only do so much. Update 8/26: has improved shifting so I added one star. Took a while to see full results, would buy again.
B00TM25WQ4|5|good.
B00KWMI5KS|4|Nothing extra special and didn't perfectly fit the Honda Civic (2015) we got for, but they do the trick.
B002P8R91S|4|Mostly all pros with this mirror including, looks, cost, power adjustment works as it should, and that it is identical to the factory mirror so it bolts up perfectly with no gaps what-so-ever.<br /><br />The one annoying thing  though is that the mirror shimmers a little bit within the housing when you drive over bumps.  My factory mirror never did that. Not worth removing the mirror and returning it over, but just thought I would warn you all...
B00386WOK2|5|After a smog check, I was told the front lower control arms on my '92 Lexus SC400 needed to be replaced. The parts alone cost an INSANE amount of money. Luckily, my boyfriend is Master Technician with 15+ years of experience, he took a look at it and read some online forums, found out really only the bushings were bad. We ordered these, and he got the job done. Now, the Lexus rides like a champion again. GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE.
B0040Z651E|5|I can't imagine how I drove so long without one!<br />The Windblocker virtually eliminates the turbulence and buffeting in the cockpit.  You could pretty much light a stick match and let it burn to the end while driving 70mph with this installed.  Prior to this, driving at more than 45mph was uncomfortable and, well...just not enjoyable due to the wind.  After installation it's no problem.<br />Installation is not difficult...but it will be easier with two people.  One to support the top while the other fits the bracket between it and the hard mount on the body.  I think it adds a nice touch to the car as well.<br />I'd rate this as one of the best upgrades...and no doubt the best sub-$100 one...I've done yet.<br />IF you're &#34;on the fence&#34;...jump off with no regrets!
B00SVGSDWM|1|After 2 months with the product it lost air and now I have to buy a new one. This product sucks
B004C67FP6|5|great oem filter
B00KWGAHS2|5|Best price you can find any where. Plus you get the crush washers.
B00SXBHL9Q|5|Awesome product, I highly recommend it. Installation was no problem. Great fit!
B007Y2SIGK|4|Was not given the best rating because product was returned as it was not needed. Instructions were clear and understandable.
B001GMX8S2|5|Worked as it is supposed to. Easy to install.
B00JYMZ8HK|5|Great price and value considering the consequences of not having one to protect your R V.  So far it's doing what it should.
B0093O4OOC|1|I expected the items I order to be per the description and the pictures but it wasn't even close. The attached picture is what I received. Extremely disappointed to say the least. Item is going back immediately. Giving it one star because I zero or negative stars is not an option.
B004BWU8H8|1|Picture shows ball-bearing full extension slide , cheap single roller slide than pulls out 8-5/8&#34; leaving 7&#34; still in cabinet, so you have to reach in drawer space to get access back part of drawer. I was explained to by customer service at Bestop that there is no room for full extension ball bearing slide that is pictured in there advertisements and on there box. He also reassured me that this was not sell you one thing and send another, huh??.
B010S89MGG|5|great seller; just as described and shipped quickly.  Nice item
B000CMHVJO|5|The tailgate is two thirds lighter I can let it down and raise it with two fingers. however have at least 2 to 3 people to help install install it for a full sized truck as it is a bit tricky to assemble the bar and tailgate back onto the bed.
B000CF6RX2|5|good product
B000FPY63M|4|I have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic and I bought these hooks about 2 months ago. If you've ever looked under the front end of a Cherokee, there is absolutely nothing to hook to unless you're able to reach the front axel, so that's why I purchased these hooks. Anyways, when I got them the first thing I noticed was the weight. These are a pretty heavy set of hooks, so that built my confidence a little bit that I had bought a good pair. They don't come with any instructions, but it's pretty easy to figure out. It's easy to figure it out, but actually putting them on was quite interesting. You have to take the whole front bumper off, which consists of three main bolts on each side, and a few little bolts that hold some other small things to the bumper. If your XJ is like mine, getting the 6 bumper bolts out is easier said then done. So after you actually get those bolts out and get the bumper off, you have to slide the bracket of the hooks onto the frame in between the bumper and the frame. The bracket for the hooks use the same bolt holes as the bumper and it's a pretty tight fit so you may need a few people to help finagle the bumper back into place. Also I forgot to mention, mount the hooks onto the bracket before you mount the bracket to the frame, it makes things easier that way. So you'll have the bumper bolts and then two more bolts a little father back on the frame that you have to put in and then you're done. For me it took awhile so be prepared for a bit of project. I think they look really nice on my jeep and, and the few times I've had to use them they have severed well. One of them got jerked by a Ford F-150 pretty badly so it's now bent, but they are very strong. Only reason I put 4 and not 5 stars is because of the installation hassle.
B00SW4LBPY|5|Looks great and pretty!
B001T3WXMA|5|Excited because had all parts were included.
B00D8DIHOC|5|We bought this because we like the idea of large coverage area.  The heat is not overly hot (just enough.)  Greatly sooth my back pain almost right away.  8 hours timer is convenient.  The low voltage power is safer than old school heating pad.
B002JH3TP0|5|everything worked fine  no problems
B00C9MQ3JE|5|Great product. These match my 2006 Harley Davidson 35th Anniversary Superglide perfectly. Fast shipping and a great price. Who wouldn't be happy?
B00HYYNW5K|5|Good quality, hard steel.
B004HOBZ1S|5|Fit Kia 2004 Sorento and is working very well.
B008VJZ54I|4|I wish it would have came with hardware. Other than that its fine
B002G248O4|5|Good quality.
B007PT3LGY|3|They are bright but bulbs blow too much and takes too long to order. I'll just find a different system to use. The led version that they sell are awesome but aren't as bright as these.
B00MZKGTGC|5|Rotors look and brake great. Brakes are also doing well.  I bought the front set first to test out... then I got the rear. I had an issue with one rotor, and the seller was fast and very helpful in resolving the problem.
B004UTD9JG|5|It is perfect :)
B0002JKE2I|5|Product performed as expected.  They even sent  catalogs about there product and how to treat different plastics.
B004Y4TCCU|5|i keep getting 'bumped' in traffic so I put this thing on.  It looks cool, and keeps the person who hit me from getting a dent in their front bumper LOL
B00HJEGQQ2|4|I installed these in a 2006 Porsche 911 S as replacement bulbs.  They are much brighter than the OEM's, but those are nearly 9 years old.  They took a second to warm up then got really bright.  I like them.<br /><br />The one down is that one of the bulbs was not pinned correctly.  One fit perfectly, the other did not.  I just filed off the tab but when you order something you expect them to be the same.  I don't know if this foreshadows other product quality issues or not but so far, they are bright.  I ordered 4 more to fill out my total of 6 bulbs.
B001GBIEIM|4|Well funtioning tool and a bargain for the price.
B00BKV62KU|4|A little higher than the stock, little darker too. Looks good.
B0031BQN74|5|Always great
B00W6KYJ9U|5|Excellent product! This was custom made for Jeep Wranglers - it fits my '13 Wrangler Unlimited PERFECTLY. It has what appears to be a foam core so it's rigid which means it folds up easily and cleanly and doesn't flop around when you're installing it. The storage bag is a nice touch too. Order it now...you won't be disappointed!
B00MPAYWAM|5|PERFECT FIT
B010H0QV00|4|[[VIDEOID:b32d1df3cc5b2e167d449b11a6b0d6db]] Highlights of my Video Review:<br /><br />1.  Really like the Gauge and Light part of it - very handy<br />2.

B000C81PJK|2|Did not fit :(
B000KL0DQA|1|Will not work on 2000 buick lesabre. Does not have power wire feed . You must order can bus type connections and line feed adapter
B00OVAFLRC|4|This book was writen for iBooks.  They did not even bother changing the hyperlinks to URLs.  And there are embedded videos on the pages.  Like that will work on a paper book.
B000COB5KS|2|This is NOT a direct replacment. It was .1700 too large at the rough area. that may not sound like much but you will never be able to drive that in without removing the door hinge and putting it in a press. Had to mill it down and still needed to use a porta power to press the pin in.
B004IA9TGO|5|Works great in my 2006 Chevy Impala!
B00DD0ZER8|5|Love it!
B001FBOHXO|5|super fit thanks
B00O83OBQY|4|pretty nice product, fit my 2005 f150 crew cab.... wiring was a little different but still pretty easy to connect and install
B00LB47TZ8|5|Just what I was looking for!
B0050D8SKG|5|Good product. Nice to use it on the golf course. Nice and light.
B008923LSO|4|Does what it's supposed to so far! I did have to flatten it out overnight before putting it in the car, like many describe.
B00BT86WBI|4|These HIDs are a great addition to your car as long as they are legal in your state. I live in Florida and it's illegal to have different colored headlights. Only issue I had with these bulbs is that sometimes they wouldn't come on so I would have to turn on and off the lights until they came on. They were nice while they lasted. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK IF THEY ARE LEGAL IN YOUR STATE BEFORE BUYING.
B00UB3FB9Q|1|Great Catch Pharae but Terrible Product
B00CLMBE5A|4|Installed easy enough! Took me a few hours. The hardware didn't fit through the access holes for my '15 Forester, but a step drill fixed the problem.
B000VKY3I4|4|took a long time to dry.
B000C9ODLQ|5|It is a genuine AC Delco OEM serpentine belt for GM vehicles.  It comes in the original packaging, and is much cheaper than buying it from an auto parts store.  I will get another one for my truck in the next 100,000 miles or so.  These AC Delco OEM belts last a lot longer than the cheaper ones, the one I pulled off was still good but I replaced it anyway since I was pulling it off to replace the power steering pump.
B001544JKW|5|High quality Timken brand bearings at a great price.
B004LF140U|5|Worked great in my Springdale TT. I was having issues is part of the lights and slideout was working off of battery even when plugged in. Found out it was due to a faulty converter. Replaced it with this one and it works great!
B005OH9ORE|1|This sensor does not work reliably on a '01 BMW Z3 2.5i. I found a number of sites warning not to use a non-BMW sensor -- I did not heed their advise. I thought the Delphi name was a good name (and it generally is) and attempted to save money by buying this replacement for my car. My sensor was completely defective so installing this replacement did restore drivability and made me think it was working most of the time. However, I would still occasionally experience problems starting, a noticeable sluggishness accelerating, and an occasional P0340 code being thrown. These were intermittent, some days it worked just fine.<br /><br />I have since replaced the sensor with the BMW branded part and all these problems have gone away. The car starts quickly and every time, power is smooth and increased, and no more codes. I can't say if this sensor will work on other engines but based on my experience and what I've read on BMW forums do not buy it for the BMW M54 engine. And if you are seeing the above symptoms, get the BMW part, you will love your car again.
B009FUF6DM|3|I should have considered the size more. They are also a little thinner than I'd hoped for.
B0000AWXSU|5|Excellent, very grippy gloves. I have been blasting 120psi nearly every day with these since I have purchased them and they are showing no signs of wear.<br /><br />Great product, fit my cabinet perfect.<br /><br />Hint: Measure your cabinets hole openings to determine what size gloves you will require.
B0036DVQZQ|5|Nothing better than a clean view when needed!
B006RVS7O2|5|Very Good Product
B001DRLQN4|5|worked well - correct filter
B0000AY2Z6|5|I bought this fan for my truck camper boon docking up in the mountains.  I love it.  Even if I am plugged into electric and running the A/C, I still use this little fan to block out noise while I'm sleeping.  Works great.
B002LEIB0E|5|My first impression when I pulled this out of the box was, the previous reviews don't do it justice.  It's absolutely beautiful.  I'm pretty sure the logo is enamel and really stands out. The raised detail on the rest of the plate is outstanding.  This is no cheap, stamped tin plate, if you dropped it on your foot you could break a toe, it weighs a LOT.  It's more expensive than most of the other plates I looked at here, but it is worth every extra dollar
B00G620ZVU|4|Work well
B00NEL6ONO|5|Excellent.
B00FLFQ4MM|5|Worked great and was easy to replace
B0006O1ICY|5|This an excellent product I have used for years.
B005WXDPRA|4|Does fit 90% of my 2012 Tahoe. I feel that I got what I payed for.
B001TPNCIM|5|Direct fit
B001KMO1JI|5|They fit like a glove easy install
B000COS0PG|5|Use this for airing up my Freightliner tires.... I have it attached to a hose whip with a valve so I can be out of the way while airing up the tire... I purchased this after a friend of mine was killed by a tire blowing up while inflating.... The whip and locking chuck allow me to stand back and out of  the way of any explosion.....
B00F4MUYN2|5|Ordered 2 vests about 2 weeks ago to Sweden, the payment was smooth and the deliverytime was excellent. The overall quality of the vest is superb! Im more then pleased about this product. Will both buy and highly recommend this seller and his/her products. The downside was that i had to pay another 767:- swedish kronor when i picked up my vests from the postaloffice (postförskott). The swedish customs added it because the products are new. But even with the extra cost, this order was still 600-700:- kronor cheaper then any other seller in sweden and most of the EU sellers on Amazon and E-bay!
B003V57NUQ|2|Product was rusted in carton upon arrival.
B004AIHKT2|5|If you have the problem with the pinkk thingy in your chrysler, this is the part you need.  Save yourself several hundred dollars and do it yourself.  instructive videos showjust what you need to do.
B003L358WI|5|I started doing my own oil changes, and this filter is def higher quality than the crap they give you at the 15 minute oil change places.
B000BRFQKQ|4|Just the ticket to replace those latches that dry rotted in the sun and broke.
B00496Z394|5|Good product
B00KTT5Z4S|4|Working great
B00TX5UTAY|4|Made VERY well. I ordered the wrong size, that was bad on my part. This fits a 7/8 handlebar so i ended up using it for my dirt bike anyway because it was made so well and just ordered another one in the correct size for my motorcycle.
B000KITSMI|5|I ordered this item to replace my 1994 Honda Accord a/c core, which was leaking. The installation, removal, and re-install process was straightforward and I was able to easily replace a/c core without any difficulty. I love this product! :-)
B0031GR4GS|5|everything worked great
B0076IBTKY|2|Suppose to be a 32 piece, showed up with 30. Case was screwed up as well
B002XONDFA|5|The sticker is working out well for me. I love it!
B001C6NL52|5|I like this product. well made and great design, i would recomend.
B003554TB8|5|Drove over a 1,000 miles through major thunderstorms with this lovely bag on my roof (just the straps, no roof rack) & it even survived a tire blowout AND the steep angle of the car when it was towed! Twice! (Long story) Everything inside was completely dry, too. Very pleased and extremely impressed. Durable, solid construction, tough material, well-made covered zippers and it was very easy to attach to the car. I used a yoga mat beneath mine (moving on a major budget) and it worked beautifully. Highly recommended!
B002J858HQ|3|The smell is nice enough but I have to spray a LOT in my car (10-15 sprays) to smell it at all, and then it only lasts a day or so.  I tried to keep up with it because I do like the smell, but who has the time to use it so often?  It's now sitting unused on the shelf while the Scentsy car freshener I bought at the same time 3 months ago is still going strong.
B002QGZZX8|5|working well...
B0002STS08|5|worked well
B00LU5U3DS|5|That fit beautifully!!!
B00MN7AIGE|5|The lights are extremely Brite but don't put them under the hood had reorder a new set heat fried the wires price was good fast delivery  Iwired them off tail lights  much better i order the extensions i riecommend them 3or 4 for a suv all in all a good product
B002FY9F6Y|5|Fast delivery, item as described!!!
B00FXIAC3E|1|It looked great on paper. However, when placed on surface and the backing removed, the adhesive stuck to the black decal and looks like crap. I rubbed transfer for a solid ten minutes when I noticed this happening and nothing helped. Needless to say, I trashed it.
B00CFQUKTS|5|Awesome product, fit as intended on a 1997 Bonneville  and was of good quality
B00EZBR9FO|5|Installed Window Regulator and window works wonderfully!
B001EOZSJO|5|MY CAR RUNS VERY SMOOTH NOW....
B00WFHYFCA|1|Dont buy this is fake.
B003TTRORQ|5|Love the Diablo. Really work well and will not harm your rims. Mix with water and your good to go.
B000N35KGS|5|Works well.
B00V3YUJ4E|4|Everything came in the kit like advertised. The whole process took me two days since I did not have all the proper tools however I had issues with the installation portion. I followed the directions as stated on the paperwork in the box and it was not working due to strut clearance problems at the top. I called the manufacture and the gentleman stated since the FX-4 has a different suspension such as a standard F-150 I would have to remove or loosen more components such as the lower control arms. After the whole process I was happy to step back and look at my vehicle with it even instead of the nose down configuration.
B00GJKXW8M|5|Put these on my boat for night bow fishing...lots of light, not a lot of power draw.. Great cost effective solution for what I needed.
B00MNF7IO6|5|Great lights....7&#34; is just right on my vehicle ..installation is easy...purchased the light bar too and which made it look great..I love it..it's highly recommended..
B002M9LBIC|3|Not as good as I hoped. It cleans but my rims aren't spotless.
B0012DKFEK|5|The sunshade is just what I needed for my van.  I purchased several different ones but they never fit my window 100%. This one seems to be thicker also.  My van is black with black leather interior.  The difference the sunshade makes feels like 10 to 15 degrees cooler.  I highly recommend to all Chrysler Town & Country owners.
B003BZQ7LM|5|excellent !
B0056DJMBE|5|Love it
B0099JFK2G|4|Wonderful lights work great super bright my friends love to follow me just to see my lights the only problem is the wires aren't long enough to reach the back of my car I have to cut the wires and make them longer which is a simple task for me but for people who don't know much about wiring it could be difficult the directions didn't help at all again simple task for me however I have experience with wiring.
B000AUP640|3|Couldn't change the plugs myself and mechanic wouldn't install these so didn't end up using them.
B00AB2IE8C|3|Received in about a week after purchase in a very well designed package that protected the tail lights.  Easy to install and looked great - for about  a day!  One of the tail lights fogged up.  I removed the light and made sure that there was no other moisture and reinstalled light sockets and made sure they were tight and sealed.  Still fogged up.  After so many installations and reinstallations one of the clips on the light socket broke.  I hope it stays plugged in!  Contacted seller.  They were very cooperative.  I was sent a return label immediately.  It cost me about $8 to purchase a box and packing material to send the one back.  It's been a week now and I still do not have the replacement - maybe next week!
B000C53RVM|3|Make sure that your lower shock mount sags at least four-five inches below the length of your OEM shock. Otherwise you'll be needing either spring compressors (wouldn't recommend) or you'll have to use a floor jack to compress these enough to get the bolt holes to line up. On my truck, a 98 C1500, the bottom end of the shock goes about three-four inches past the shock mount.
B00OU0PBY6|4|Easy instllation and good quality light every thing is very good except the socket in the shadow lamp littel bit biger than the original socket so it is littel bit flimsy and i put a small paper under socket to fix it.
B0018EAKFM|1|I like the material, but the orange in the 'C' is dirty and the mats look like they have been used. I'm very disappointed as I ordered my hubby Boston Red Sox mats and his were fine.
B0001EXBQK|4|looks great in my Honda crv.! had to force the clips in to secure it to the hood of the car. you have to hear a pop that is when it is secure on the the hood.
B00Z646LSK|4|Mostly good. A couple of issues though:<br /><br />1. The actual switchblade key piece fits into the top section a little too tight; it won't allow the key to snap out without digging it out of the locked position. I'm sure some sanding somewhere could fix this, I'll have to figure that out.<br /><br />2. The bottom section where the batteries go is not exactly the same as the original. The circular section where the batteries sit is slightly larger, allowing them to wiggle around and fall out. There's no plastic arms that make the batteries &#34;snap&#34; into place like the original does, so it's a bit tricky to get them in place to close the two pieces together, as the chip doesn't stay in place either. I was having issues getting the batteries to touch the contacts on the board because of them shifting around, so I had to reopen it many times before it finally worked.<br /><br />This also makes it pretty difficult to attach the keyring to the loop, as you have to do this before you close the housing up as well.<br /><br />3. This does NOT come with the VW emblem sticker for the back. Make sure you order those as well (they're relatively cheap) if you care about that sort of thing.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth the money if you can get it to work properly, and you want to &#34;refurb&#34; your key fob. Keep in mind: VW dealerships will not cut this key for you. They send it off to the manufacturer, as trying to cut the key will damage their own machines for some reason. It also does not come with the chip, so make sure you have one from your original key.
B008MMOQKS|5|Great Product. we have a convertible, keeping it garaged so it never gets too dirty. Every couple months we use this product or a similar one, to keep the soft ragtop of our car clean.
B000COS8FI|5|A GREAT TIRE GUAGE ! HAD IT FOR A COUPLE YEARS , NO PROBLEMS !
B001F0IE7A|5|FIT PERFECT NOT BOAT IN GARAGE :)
B0071I3OAC|4|Door lock cable wasn't exactly the same as the one I replaced on my 2003 Avalon. Color is off a little from original. The door latch works fine, but I have to manually lock & unlock the door due to the lock cable to swing tab issue. Overall, Looks and performs better than the broken one I replaced.
B002UJVNFA|5|Love em
B000BRQ0TW|5|Great
B00S4J0HFC|4|works well
B001JT5JVQ|5|This stuff ROCKS!
B002R1MU4Y|5|Took 5 years off of the car!! I bought both sides just wanted to show comparison. new on left old on right
B00URELPU8|4|Color was a bright white which was a little off from my White 2009 Jeep Wrangler but all in all great piece.
B003ZWHJZO|4|So my drivers side interior door pull latch suddenly broke off in my 2004 Toyota Camry. Why? Who knows... The important thing is I found this replacement, watched a short YouTube video on a step by step fix, and voila... back in business! For the DIY crowd, this is a no brainer. Okay, so the pull handle is a different color than the original- shiny silver instead of light grayish tan. The rest of the housing still matches fine and besides, opening the door with a pair of pliers was getting old fast. Bottom line... it works. If I had to do it all over again, this is the route I would take.
B00K8WO768|5|Awesome little light.  This is well worth the price.  I wish it was rechargeable, but it takes AAA batteries.  The rechargeable batteries don't last too long.
B00KWDR7K6|5|Gas tank cap
B00EXHZ2VI|5|Fit my 2008 Escalade perfectly.  Original caps were stolen at WHOLE FOODS.
B00NT95PEA|5|These look great and fit my 2015 GMC Yukon perfectly.  Love these mats.
B000P0VTG4|5|works great
B00PC16LL4|1|This thing sucks don't waste your money on it it doesn't sound real and it's falls off all the time waste of my money
B000OF10BY|4|Very good tool for the price. Seals tend to give up after a year or two. That being said we use this tool hard and posibly too hard occasionally. We definatly get our moneys worth out of it.
B00A46I6JW|5|Ordered on Sunday, at my house Tuesday.  Awesome!!  Easy install,  feels and looks just like the oem ones I took off for way cheaper than anyone else.  First 50 miles felt great.
B0036IQ90S|1|Broke first time used
B00EKTJFLW|5|Great product just be sure to check if you have a key whole AND/OR a camera!!! I forgot to look and had to order two before I got the correct one but totally my fault! but Product worked great!
B00MSJAI80|5|Wonderful company! Wonderful stickers
B007XZJTWK|5|The fog light work perfectly and easy to install, I take it 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
B00LNOK4E4|5|Works great! I'm happy with the product.
B001C8WS1S|5|I love these brakes thank you my escalade now stops on a dime.
B0066QWCOO|5|good product working well...
B00BD5GZFU|3|Well, it took almost 2 weeks for this item to arrive. And then when I opened the package to put them on my car seats, I saw that a seam is already coming apart. It was very hard to fit the seat cover over the head rest; I was afraid the material was going to rip because the hole is a bit too small. The seat cover also completely covers the pockets on the back of the drivers and passenger seats, so I'm sending these back. I like the material, but these just are not going to work for me.
B000RTAYE6|4|Its a great case keeps all the cables with my code reader
B00651C2Z4|4|The antenna does bend a lot when driving at a good speed butt it is for off road. Easy to install and good reception.
B00EEGE3BI|4|Good fit, would recommend re-using the stock rubber pieces that go between the headlight and grille as the new ones that come with the assembly tend to get stuck crooked in that spot. And use care when swapping those rubber pieces, the plastic retainers are just that...thin plastic. Otherwise they look great on the truck and visibility is the same if not slightly better
B000CO7IIQ|5|Works great
B00GMX6WDS|5|I love using  these in my car, I HATE wearing a seatbelt. Now I barely notice it's there. Definitely a good buy!
B001H227HY|5|Awesome
B004EB12FS|4|Great product!!  Would recommend it to anyone!!
B00CX7HTXY|5|couldn't be happier, exact fit, great price, still workin, looks like oem part.  will definitely buy again.
B00ONDM07G|5|Great item easy to install and phone will not slip out
B000EDQQBU|5|Good stuff but not enough for a 14&#34; vent.  Get 2 rolls for good coverage.
B00KB8LSCA|4|Decent
B005I4DNZ2|4|Very easy to follow kit with little effort, i just wish the wire coming from the relay to the horn its self was a little longer for a more versatile placement.
B008641QB4|1|It turned all brown after just one summer. Granted I live in a city where the weather reaches 100 degrees but you'd expect more from a product that is supposedly worth $33.
B00464IBFM|1|Not the SilBlades of old!  I bought these after I had a pair several years ago, hoping that they were of the same quality.  They were not.  After the 90 day break-in period, they still left streaks and did a terrible job of clearing the windshield of, well, anything.  Plus, they chattered across the windshield, especially in the cold and snow.  I had put them on to replace a pair of $6 blades that were old.  After having the SilBlades on for several months, I put the old, cheap blades back on and the performance matched that of the SilBlades.  After another month or so, I bought a pair of $10/each blades made by a different brand and the performance is literally night and day.  Because I did not buy direct from SilBlade and it was past Amazon's return period, I am stuck with these blades which are guaranteed for 5 years.  I wanted so badly for them to work, and I am so disappointed.  I will not be buying SilBlades again, especially because they really do not stand behind their warranty if you happen to purchase their blades from a third party authorized seller.
B000CJ05WW|5|Nice and small relay. Works great!!
B0055EMN7Y|5|I am pleased with the look of the caps. After reading the reviews and seeing the nightmares people had with rusting, i coated all of the stems with WD40 before putting the caps on. We'll see if this does the trick.
B003REP8PI|1|I ordered 2 floor mats and got a welcome mat
B000BYELQY|1|WARNING!! The 24&#34; and 19&#34; DO NOT fit 2012 Jetta's and probably models after. The product that was sent was from 2011 as well.
B009EVJC3C|5|This was exactly what the doctor ordered to allow me to install Hella E-Code headlights in my wrangler.
B00GWWVZ2C|5|very pleased with product
B00KMLU7D2|5|it was perfect
B0031I20RE|2|not as nice as the original ones. these are flimsy pseudo plastic tarps, basically.. shame as the originals were much better. not buying again.
B008EBCFSC|4|The alternator is working well. Easy enough to install.
B00X2TUW1I|5|Awesome product!!! No silly suction cups. Stuck right on the window with zero prep. I can move it easily and see through it great. I have it in the back middle window for the rear facing child and it works great. So glad I took a chance and ordered. I will be getting another set for my other car.
B00RD982MO|2|I expected a better scent
B000IY8OKQ|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B00FSBE7MI|4|This tent performed  decently. I will get regular use out of it. It is more suited for cold weather camping. I used it in June of this year in Florida. The rainfly sits right on top of the tent leaving no room for breeze or airflow. So in Florida during June where it is 90 degrees plus and always a chance of rain it can get miserable inside a tent with little to no airflow. I don't go camping for modern conveniences, though, so being hot at night was something I just had to deal with. Otherwise, I was pleased with this tent. Setup does take a bit of time and trial-by-error learning, but once you get the hang of it setup is not too bad. Breakdown is amazingly simple, 2 minutes or less by yourself.
B000B5NS6C|5|Excellent cover.  No problems.
B00OCEGONC|5|I've used it a few times and really like it. I've used with hot oil and the hose didn't melt or collapse. I pulled a quart of hot oil in under 2 mins.  it's not super tough (hard plastic) so you have to be careful / smart but it'll definitely last. I'm very happy with my purchase and so are my cars.
B00AE4U6T2|5|I bought it as a gift and haven't gotten any negative feedback.
B00QJVLJBI|2|It's very thin and the magnets won't last even a week. Doesn't block the sun completely as it's very thin.
B005BGRNXK|1|I am in agreement w previous reviewer. Pics are very deceiving. Looks to be all one piece. This is actually 2 pieces, not one piece. Offering no protection for center hump carpet area. I am not satisfied.
B00BFDG4QU|5|With a Check Engine light on and my dealership offering to read the code for $99, I stopped in an Advanced Auto Parts up in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and the fella was kind enough to bring a code reader out to my car and read if for FREE (thanks, dude!). It showed that the fault was in the evaporative system so the first weak link in that chain was the fuel cap...the car is now thirteen years old so you figure that some moving part or another would be the first thing to go...and the fuel cap is probably the cheapest part so it was a bit of a no-brainer to try that first. Fast shipping and a perfect fit....Check Engine light off...happy ending and, sorry Honda, no $99 for a code check.
B00BF2CYKQ|4|Always questionable about proper fit on this type of part, but these all fit just right and seem to be doing the job. By the way, bavauto.com has an excellent video on the installation. It's a bit tricky.
B00OPMIR2M|4|[[VIDEOID:e55e8a254766bb76e832a767d0ae746f]]My husband and I both tried this tire pressure gauge and we both really like. The only complaint from both of us is that from what we can tell there is no way to let air out of whatever you are checking the pressure on.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is easy to use. There is one button that turns it on and the green light comes on to help you see what you are doing.  The gauge defaults to PSI but you can cycle through other measurements.<br /><br />The handle is a plastic material that has finger grooves to grip it easier and there is an open area on the end so you can hang or store this easily.<br /><br />I have included a video so you can see this in action. I have to say that both my husband's and my favorite thing is that it measures half measurements as well so it is very accurate as far as we can tell. Also by reviewing this I noticed that I need air in my tires so that's good to know. :-)<br /><br />I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.
B004940ZNK|5|Works great on my 2006 G6, quick and easy installment! Great buy will buy from again.
B00JTUBTU2|5|I've used M1 since 1996 and I've always been very happy with it. Maybe there are better oils and there certainly are cheaper oils but i'm satisfied with M1. Now all my cars have over 100K I have switched to M1 HM.
B008CE0W5Y|4|As described and expected thank you.
B00ARVNBYO|5|Easy installation in my 2001 Ford F350, the Turbo pipe alone is larger than the stock exhaust and this dropped my ERG temp by 50 to 200 F
B00W8F10XG|5|Installed it as vanity mirror lights replacing OEM bulbs on my 2003 Lexus LS430. I have not had any issues yet with any of the bulbs installed so far. It works like a charm.
B007V2BVNK|5|Fits great and works well
B0073ME1F8|5|Perfect fit,looks like a well made product. My car is back to running cool again!! About the sales people, I ordered the wrong radiator at first and these guys went way beyond helpful with reordering and refund was fast and quick!d
B000KL1FQW|5|Perfect fit for my 2005 Expedition
B009AQS5JS|5|Looks good and reflects too! The red reflector goes with the car's rear lights very well.
B000BRQ0TW|3|Why did. I buy this.  I wanted to fix dish washer rack.
B00V9DZ8ZO|5|Very good I love it, I both this on and I try it can u help me find the right one for my Toyota  yaris 2009
B00ESN5PT6|3|Its so so
B006EGQALC|5|Good product, good prce
B001GC2LVM|1|Only had these for about 4 months. We were initially pleased with the purchase since they worked as advertised the first two times we used them.  However, when driving up on them the 3rd time, we heard a very loud Pop!  When we checked, we found that both levelers had snapped completely in two and we were left with expensive pieces of plastic.  We were only trying to raise the camper about 3&#34; and we drive a small motor home that weighs about 10K pounds, so weight shouldn't have been an issue.  I definitely would not recommend these.
B004YJP4WW|5|Perfect fit, looks like factory.
B00E1SPP5M|5|Really nice feeling brakes.  Stops on a dime.
B00PC0G07A|5|I purchased this item for a 2003 350z.  The steering wheel had become worn at the top and was sticky to touch.  I was looking for a slim cover and this item was exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't want one of the slip on bulky types.  This item took about 45 minutes to sew onto the wheel, but it looks so much better than the other kinds, more of a factory look to it.  In addition the feel of the cover is great, just enough padding and super soft..and best of all no more stickiness!  For the price and look of this cover, you really can't go wrong!
B000A8JNF0|5|woks well
B000CAVEBM|5|good price and nice product
B001UC7L0Y|4|Formed correctly for 06 Sonata with one exception - it was cut at a slant. I had to put a clamp on the ends, mark and then cut with a knife (don't use razor knife, that won't get you anywhere with rubber. Has to be a rough edged unpolished knife). Material removed was actually the excess originally meant to be removed, so after that minor fix it was the exact size and could now be installed.<br /><br />PS: During the installation I broke the plastic portion of the clip that attaches the middle of the hose to the engine. Plastic was brittle and was replaced by 3 layers of 0.8mm thick rubber fiber gasket material + 2 HF hose clamps. It looks all pretty now, will see how it holds up to use.
B002UC6NFM|4|Works well
B0013FY5ZC|5|Perfect replacement; easy to install and solved problem.
B00DDQ19M6|3|Installing it was a breeze, but the plastic is molded wrong. I will try to post a pic. May not be a big deal to some, but I like my vehicle looking good. Next time I'll pay the extra hundred and go to the dealership. On the picture, the left side goes down and it's the opposite for the driver's side.
B000HBNTX2|5|great stuff for the price. bought 4 single ones instead of the case and saved almost 1/2
B00J3D6AAO|5|exact fit,  keeps sun off dash.
B0098WDL1G|5|They're really nice but it doesn't cover the entire valve stem, it was my fault for not checking it right. Other than that it's a great product
B00HH3JWOS|5|fit like i hoped. nice
B00D24U3ZS|1|Did not receive same one in picture parking brake wire too short and no wires were labeled
B003GC74NK|4|Time will te;; but so far working well.
B006DX187W|5|Just to let everybody know, I went to the Dodge Dealership and looked up the parts for the 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 St 3.7L. This is the only o2 Sensor Listed for the engine. Other company's list the ( Mopar 56029050AA Oxygen Sensor) as fitting also. This one fits all four positions on the exhaust system BEFORE AND AFTER THE CAT, RIGHT AND LIFT SIDES. SO IT FITS, FOR ALL FOUR SENSORS
B00A7582BW|5|Great works perfect
B000A8QLUA|5|I bought these because I was getting hesitation at around 2,000 rpm and having rough starts. The removal and instillation takes about 10 minutes. I started up the car and had no problems (still haven't almost 1500 miles later) and the hesitation is gone. As an added bonus, the engine has a little more of a roar to it.<br /><br />I'll be buying these my future plug replacements.
B00XS5U82Y|4|Easy to install
B0015PMZN4|5|Works great!
B000F3C0WI|4|Fits my Dodge Ram 1500 2001 nicely. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5, because it didn't come with fasteners as stated in direction. I had carpet tape on hand and it worked out great. So I would buy some dbl stick carpet tape so it contours to dashboard. And last don't expect it to ship right away, took over two weeks to arrive.
B00BMRZN66|5|We purchased the Terapump to use when we dry camp in our RV and want to put water in our fresh water tank.  Trying to lift up a 10 gal plastic container full of water to pour into the trailer is not the easiest thing to do, so this pump will save wear and tear on our backs!
B0006H934Q|5|it came in days and was perfect my husband fixed the RV and we were off thanks
B0002SA0AA|5|arrived fast and fits great
B005JWCPC0|5|Its fits perfectly and it matches the seat covers I recently bought. I can't wait to order more! I love Amazon!
B002XLHUQG|5|Love them for our travel trailer.  Much better than those rubber blocks
B00UW1T31Y|5|Great product installed very easy and fit perfect.
B00KGGTF9U|3|Its supposedly the right size for my vehicle but it will not stay up. Not sturdy enough so it keeps falling down. I like the idea but just doesnt seem to work very well with my Expedition. Maybe it will work better with other cars, I am not sure.
B00ZV7CJJC|5|Looks Just fine on my 2004 GC Laredo WJ.
B000XS9W9O|4|Great battery, bought for my Heritage Softail Classic, works great.
B003908L3Q|5|It was on spot
B003CGEQ5E|5|Came in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed.
B00C7M3CYA|5|FYI - the photo is incorrect. Blue are the Sport springs. The Super Sport springs which this item is, are actually red. Otherwise these were exactly what I needed and installed perfectly.
B003PB46NS|3|Very noise<br />I don't think it's for older cars because of the amp it draws
B00IKACI9S|5|These were just what I needed to compleat my install.  They come with grease and the torque spec for installing them. Great product
B002DOME1E|5|Have found many uses for these aside from just holding the wheel of my bike straight while on the rack. I've also used them to hold parts together when glueing, and I'm sure theres a ton of applications for these.
B00GZLMEPM|4|Went well following instructions.
B001LL9UQ2|5|nice
B004HCOE7W|5|Great
B00A23V5EU|5|Wow what a cost saver!Dealer wanted $750 to replace just the compressor.This is a complete plug and play.Took a total of 15 minutes to remove old and install new.
B0030DEQPE|5|perfect fit. easy to install
B002OR41J8|5|Worked perfectly.
B004WMOK4Y|5|fits great in my factory fury
B007MFZEXO|5|Great horn!! Just like Dukes of Hazzard!
B0002KKPXK|5|If you stripped threads, then this is the product you need.  The hole is drilled larger than the original thread, then tapped with the included tap to allow the outside helicoil thread to thread into the new hole.  Then the inside thread on the helicoil is the original size thread of the one you ordered.  I have used these many times, and have never been disappointed with the results.
B00U4MKS7O|5|Awesome bag. Great product. Perfect for gear.
B007NNKCKK|1|Fell apart when putting it on shiftier, very cheap and returned it and got a better one!
B00UHD4HJA|5|Absolutely love them! Great buy. Totally amazing. Love all the designs. I recommend.
B000CLQEU2|2|Squeak all the time
B0049Z6WQ8|5|It works great. The alternator appeared to be all new components. I believe it was possibly a remanufactured unit due to markings that resembled those used to assure reassembly has parts properly alligned . Another purchaser had written a similar review I noticed. Another clue was the box it was packaged in. It was clearly marked remanufactured .
B00AKA6QC6|5|fit great on my BMW 135i n54
B000MUTAGS|4|ok
B00V526ETS|5|Very good quality!
B00GHT84LA|5|Work good
B000QFORK8|5|Just about the greatest Leather conditioner ever!!!!
B00JSJMTE4|5|Fits perfect 2007 Silverado Classic
B000WJAH5M|5|looks great and help with vibration would buy from them again easy install just follow directions
B003RQTJ88|3|The Red heart did not last as long as the white letters.
B004JNJPHI|5|Lets start by saying I possess a bit of mechanical knowledge.  I had also tore the door apart once beforehand to see why my window on my 2007 Ford Expedition had decided to stay in the down position.  That being said this item fit the bill perfectly.  Ford has a problem with the regulators, not being geared properly and small amounts of water making its way down into the cables on the gearbox causing them to rust and break.  The later is the problem I had.  I purchased this item off amazon and installed it the following weekend.  Replacement was simple and straightfoward.  There are many youtube videos and websites out the to lead you through the process. The part went in easily and was as an exact replacement as I see.  Only mistake I made was I didnt properly seat my door handle release cable.  So joy of joy, after testing the window I locked the car up and went about my weekend.  Monday morning I drove to work and could not open my car door from the inside to get out.  Thankfully I had fixed my window so I could roll it down and open the car door from the outside.  Fixed it that afternoon after work.  The new driverside window I replaced goes down about twice as fast as the original passenger side.  I think when cooler weather comes in I will be replacing the otherside as well.  Excellent part.
B000842AAQ|5|I haven't pulled anything with it yet, but it wasn't at all difficult to install.  The wiring kit was more time consuming, but definitely not hard to do!
B005MZYTN2|5|Perfect sign looks exactly like the picture quick shipping
B000NCOKZQ|5|As advertised. Simple installation.
B000A6TIHA|4|perfect replacement light.
B00XAX4B9A|4|Don't forget to put your visors down to hold in place like I did! Duh! Easy to fold. I don't bother trying to stuff back in bag, (who has time for that) it fits in pocket of back seat.
B0009YDQCG|3|I had these for a year and a half in my 4runner, which I drive to work every day.  The rear mats seem very small but they rarely get used.  The front mats look and fit nice, and the rubber is durable, but the carpeted part is very thin and separated from both the drivers and passengers side after about a year.  I rarely have passengers, so perhaps the Houston heat was too much for the glue.
B0039XST1C|3|BEWARE..not for use on an SUV or truck...product may be good, but make sure it gives you the clearance you need.
B007A2RB9O|5|Perfect color match
