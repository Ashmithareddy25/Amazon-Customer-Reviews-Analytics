B00000IQMT|2.0|The Star Wars episode 1 soundtrack really isn't so great. Most of the tracks are fairly boring, and the exciting ones aren't really worth your money. Get Episode 3; it's far better than this one. <br />
0670033375|5.0|\\"Collapse\\" is a beautiful book! Diamond blends together science from a wide variety of academic fields with history, making geography a living and appealing subject.  Without indulging in oversimplifications, the author develops a discourse as to how environmental factors have played an important role in the demise of now lost civilizations. Not always that fate was self-inflicted, but their leaders' inability to have a fresh look at what was really happening around them, made the final blow inevitable. The collapse of societies is explained by five contributing factors: 1) environmental deterioration caused by natural resources mismanagement; 2) climate changes; 3) hostile neighbors; 4) relationships with trade partners; and 5) the society's response to its environmental problems. <br /> <br />The book is divided in 4 parts. The first part is a contemporary account of Montana's region in the US and serves as a prologue for the second part, which deals with lost communities around the world (Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands in the Pacific, the Anasazi in today New Mexico, the Maya in central America, the Norse Greenland). However, Diamond also portraits success stories of societies (New Guinea highlands, Tikopia, Japan), which were able to manage more sensibly their environment. The second part is definitively the most interesting to read for both breath and quality of information therein.  <br />Part three deals with contemporary societies and how they have coped with their environmental constraints (Rwanda, Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, Australia). This part reflects the \\"then and now\\" approach by Diamond in \\"Collapse\\" and serves the purpose to put in a contemporary context what happened in other circumstances in the past with lost civilizations. Finally, in the last part, Diamond tries to provide practical lessons for today, taking examples from the mining, oil, logging, and seafood industries.  This part is frankly a little pedantic and provides a morale too easy to grasp for any public that it could have been safely omitted. In fact, the first three parts are self-explaining and would have left some room to the reader for critical thinking. It is also the part less fully developed and more generic and could give rise to claims that the book is one-sided pro-environment and anti-business. This is obviously not the case in the first parts of the book, in which arguments are actually well balanced and nuanced.  However, the lessons from the book are obvious, but the practical steps proposed by Diamond are a little superficial and lack a firm base in political science and environmental economics. Leaders and citizens are driven by short term interest and motives, and in such conditions non-cooperative behaviors are dominant strategies (the tragedy of the commons quoted throughout the book is only the simplest example). Diamond wanted to end the book with an optimistic note and we are glad for that.    <br />The book is highly recommended to all, both the general reader and the concerned citizen. It also provides useful thought provoking hints for more professional readers in history and social sciences.  <br />
B0001AVZA8|5.0|The lack of violence and rudeness surprised me as I find it hard to find a movie free from violence and meanness even in comedies nowadays. I find all the characters in the movies irresistibly adorable. They are very smart, considerate, and have good manners at any circumstance. It is a comedy as well as being a good drama, and I enjoyed it in a great deal. Having no mean person in the story makes a very safe entertainment movie.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|What more can I say?  Johnny Depp shows his range in this film, when you think of the movies he has done throughout his career.  Its light, and funny, and musical - what more can you ask for???
B000001Y2U|5.0|this album is a classic...i'm not a fan of industrial or popular music at all...i hate the stuff, to be honest with you...it's terrible, trite and repetitive and it'll more than likely go the way of disco. but this...this is amazing. i've never liked marilyn manson's albums very much either, but this is a bona fide classic. and i love every song on this cd...the lyrics are incredibly clever, and the music is catchy and not radio friendly at the same time...and i want to tell the christians that have reviewed this cd and the teen dabblers alike that not all christians are uptight freaks of nature who think Satan made rock and roll...i'm a christian, i love this album and i listen to hardcore and metal...so everyone can shut up about christians not thinking for themselves and being mindless drones for the church. for starters...catholics are the ones with \\"The Church\\" and fundamentalists are the psychopaths who burn records at demonstrations and protest shows...we're not all soccer mom psychos and we're not all anal retentive morons, either. SOME of us appreciate good music...so lay off already. the best songs on this album in my opinion are Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Mr. Superstar, Tourniquet [one of my favorite songs, period, actually] and 1996...well...i liked that one more when i was thirteen...but it's still decent when you're really in a bad mood. i don't listen to this that often anymore...but it's good to know that the album is still amazing nine years after you bought it initially.
B000002ITK|4.0|Twisted Sister is one of the very few hairmetal bands that have talent and arent cliche. Everyone thinks that just because Bon Jovi, Warrant, and Poison sucks that so will TS...WRONG! TS is a decent band to say the least, and Dee Snider will murder Bon Jovi with his pinky! Everyones heard 'We're not Gonna Take it' and 'I wanna Rock!' before, but those arent TS's only good songs. Anyway, the instrumental section of Sister is good as well and makes Bon Jovi look like road kill (well, they are road kill). This is good hairmetal, so get TS, Van Halens 1984, and something by Motley Crue where Vince Niel isn't there (I hate Vince Niel...).
0739313126|5.0|Had previously read the book and loved it.  The CD was great too, although it was not as easy to \\"put down\\" and come back to...  If traveling long distances or have the ability to stop and start, this CD is highly recommended.  Though not necessary, I would recommend reading \\"Angels and Demons\\" first (book or CD) as events from this book are referenced in The Da Vinci Code.

B0000C8AQM|5.0|If you're a rock fan,like I am,this album is for you. If you saw the film and own it(VHS or DVD),this album is for you. The film's star Jack Black with the kids he worked with in the film recorded a couple of tunes from this album,the title track and IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP. The latter track also featured AC/DC. Black and the kids recorded the songs as SCHOOL OF ROCK. Memorable classic rock tunes from this album include The Doors' 1969 hit TOUCH ME(not heard in the film) and Cream's 1968 hit SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE. However,in one scene of the film,Dewey Finn(Black) and one of the Horace Green Elementary School children,are performing TOUCH ME themselves. Other great rockers are Stevie Nicks' THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN and The Who's SUBSTITUTE. This album contains a few bits of dialogue from the film also. I love HEAL ME,I'M HEARTSICK which is heard in the Battle of the Bands scene. All the other songs are great.
B00009RAJJ|4.0|Sprawling, ambitious and down right inscrutible, \\"Tusk\\" had a lot in common with The Beatles' infamous \\"White Album\\". The Beatles reacting to the success and hype of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" elected to go the simple route with a plain white sleeve (\\"The Beatles\\" the actual title of the album was embossed on the cover)and music as stark and different as \\"Pepper\\" was brimming with baroque arrangements. The same would be true of \\"Tusk\\" compared to \\"Rumours\\". \\"Tusk\\" is an ambitious attempt to escape the mould of \\"Rumours\\". Listen to the different tracks one can tell immediately; Buckingham's songs are edgy with a hint of the attitude of new wave and even punk in the seams. There was still the honest craftsmanship and love of melody (and a few tips of the hat to Brian Wilson)but Buckingham went to the edge of \\"The Chain\\" and leaped over into the abyss.<br /><br />Nicks' material has much of the mystical sound of her material for the band's two previous albums but here there's an even stronger sense of dreaminess; it's as if the songs themselves are surrounded by cotton candy. \\"Sarah\\" is the closest to her more traditional sound while \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" is attempt to try something different.<br /><br />McVie's material is suffused with the dreamy pop melodies that made her material perfect for top 40 radio at the time. \\"Think About Me\\" could easily have come off of \\"Rumours\\" but the production has a raw edge to it. Ironically, it wasn't released as a single. With Buckingham's perfect harmonies it's the closest to a melodic masterpiece on the album. \\"Over and Over\\" is the strongest departure for her with its blues shuffle beat. Her throaty vocal hints at a weariness and sense of resignation for a one-sided love affair.\\"Brown Eyes\\" starts off with a nice jazzy bit of bass playing by John McVie and Christine's moody vocal. We also get \\"Never Make Me Cry\\" in a spare version of the same song.\\"Honey Hi\\" was a song by McVie I never cared for but the stripped down version here actually improves on the final version.<br /><br />As to the bonus disc--are these earlier working drafts and demos a radical departure compared to the final versions? No. But many of them have their charms. \\"Sarah\\" has an off handed quality and candid quality to it minus the dream backing vocals. It's spare arrangement provides a nice contrast to the production that surrounds the final version. While I like \\"Storms\\" on the original \\"Tusk\\" album, I prefer the spare, stark demo version included on disc two with the full echo on Nicks' voice. The rising organ behind her vocal adds a nice dramatic tension to the song. We also get an early version of \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" without overdubs.<br /><br />\\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" (here called Lindsey's Song # 1) has a charming toy piano and what sounds like Buckingham beating a box. It's different enough from the final version (and without lyrics)to make it a nice alternative to the final version. \\"That's All For Everyone\\" (Lindsey's Song # 2)has the germ of the final song in the simple chord progression but the simple percussion and the fact that it's missing vocals allows you to appreciate the lilting melody. It sounds like it could have come off a Brian Wilson era Beach Boys album. \\"Out on the Road\\" sounds like a sped up version of a country song. No, it's just an earlier version of \\"That's Enough For Me\\". It doesn't differ radically from the final version. \\"Song # 1\\" is \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" in slightly different clothes.<br /><br />We also get two cover songs; Jorge Caulderon's \\"Kiss and Run\\" played during a rehearsal session. Recorded off the cuff, it's got rustic charm. \\"Farmer's Daughter\\" is a studio version of the same song recorded on the quartets \\"Live\\" album (that version was recorded during a soundcheck). The single version of \\"Think About Me\\" has a bit more punch than the album version. The single version of \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" ends with Buckingham's freak out guitar part.<br /><br />A marvelous album that I liked quitea bit when it was first released will hopefully get a new evaluation by 70's era Mac fans. It's an underrated album that, like The Beatles' \\"White Album\\", goes in three very different directions all of them interesting. Well worth picking up if nothing else than for the restored version of \\"Sarah\\".a bit when it was first released will hopefully get a new evaluation by 70's era Mac fans.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael you have created a movement with your take on music. <br />I love how you interpret songs the way you do and how you make them fresh and revitalized and your own. <br />Your duet with Nelly F. (I was not a fan of hers before this cut) is heaven sent. Never have I heard Quando Quando Quando sound this way and I love it. <br />To hear Chris Botti providing his instrumental magic on Song for You just adds to an already magnificent compilation of music. <br />All I could ever ask for is MORE MORE MORE!
B00006LJ6X|5.0|How could it happen that Chicago became a pop-hits machine after Chicago VII? After listening the remastered version of this fantastic album I just say that this was the last excellent music they did.  <br /> <br />The songs \\"Aire, prelude and Devil's sweet\\" songs are performed in what I consider the peak in the chicago musical career. <br /> <br />\\"Byblos\\" is one of the most introspected songs of Tery Kath and I have to say that the new version included in the bonus tracks is better than the original one. It's more vivid. <br /> <br />One of my favorite life time chicago songs is \\"Call on me\\" maybe because I'm a latin from Mexico City. <br /> <br />As Danny Seraphine (the excellent original drummer) has stated, after Chicago VII, they lost a legion of loyal fans that hated the ballads. <br /> <br />If you are a new musical searcher of excellent bands from the 70's, this band and this New remastered version of Chicago VII must be in your catalogue. An incredible band always rejected by the critics. Just listen.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is a western set in the future.  It centers around the Firefly-class ship, Serenity.  Most of the show has a sepia-tone filter to make it look aged and dusty.  If you missed this one when it was first run, you have a second chance, and its worth it.  There are three unaired episodes for those who did.  If you want to enjoy the motion picture Serenity in the fall, watch these DVDs all the way through.  Beware though, the theme music gets in your head.

B00003CX9E|1.0|I just want to say that NOTHING, absolutely nothing in the world could make me sit through this travesty ever, ever again.  It is mystifying to me, with all the great films out there that this piece of ponderous intellectualism would be voted as the number one film of all time.  Obviously, there are many who agree with me.  This is one of the worst films I have ever sat through and believe me ...it took a lot.  I dozed several times during the viewing and when I woke up had to back up to the places where I dozed off just to see if I had missed anything.....(I hadn't).  This is the most overrated picture I have ever seen and certainly not worthy to hold the title of \\"Best film ever made\\".  That is a laugh!!  Needless to say, I sold mine for 12 bucks at used CD store.
6300216802|3.0|Star Trek The Motion Picture overall is a good movie, but a little too long for it's own good. This movie just doesn't have that much action in it, but great special fx and story keep this movie interesting.<br /><br />One of the best things about this movie are the references that would later appear in other Trek series, mainly the Borg. Some of the stuff used in this movie that would later be used in Trek again.<br /><br />- The opening theme would become the theme for Star Trek TNG<br /><br />- Spock says \\"Resistance is Futile\\"<br /><br />- VGER's name turns out to be a name used later (no spoiler)<br /><br />- There is talk about a planet of living machines (Borg)<br /><br />- Riker and Deanna Troi are based on Decker and Ilia<br /><br />This movie would be fantastic if they just left out the long scenes where Scotty and Kirk are first going to the Enterprise and when the Enterprise is flying into VGER. Those two scenes are very long and not needed.<br /><br />If you like character/story driven movies, this is great! But it is still slow/dull at some points of the film.
0312263120|3.0|National Security Agency (NSA) has a data bank that contains classified information. The data bank is covered by security layers to prevent hackers. Enter the villain  - a computer worm - that threatens to erase the security barriers that will make the classified NSA information accessible to anyone with a modem! The government guys face a predicament. They cannot just shutdown the data bank because it is the backbone of US intelligence operations. Field operatives use the data bank for crucial mission updates. The race is on to find out the password to prevent the worm from compromising the US intelligence information system.<br /><br />Dan Brown had a great idea for a plot, but I felt the execution was a bit of disappointment. For example, I fail to understand why David, a professor, is sent to Spain to retrieve the password. Surely, NSA must be having trained agents for these missions. Characters: hero is a professor who is six feet tall, handsome and heroin is beautiful, sexy, smart. Mills and Boon material?<br /><br />The plot is exciting - a techno-thriller. And with Dan Brown always interested in making the reader decipher codes, something on encryption was bound to come from him. However, after reading this book, I am still wondering whether this is a top-notch stuff.
B000089RVR|2.0|I received this CD as a gift from my boyfriend a few months ago and while I thought the songs were nice, I wasn't completely blown away. Everything was a little TOO loungey and where were the dance tunes?  <br /> <br />I wouldn't go see Dido in concert because I probably would just fall asleep after the fifth song or so. She doesn't have the voice to capture your attention and keep it for very long.
B0009I7NOO|5.0|The critics, as usual, look down upon the Oasis's new album, even the \\"professional critic\\" who wrote the editorial review right on this web-page. You know...I would just love to see these paid critics be put in a studio and be made to make an album. Then we'll see who's full of it. One thing that I have noticed about Oasis is that they stick to their guns. So what if their record collection was not very eclectic and that you can clearly hear their influences. Every band/artist out there has been influenced by other musicians and yes, even the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Oasis makes the kind of music that they want to make and that's it.

B00008K7AM|3.0|I do believe that this movie is quite hilarious. People say it is stupid, well, of course it is, but it's fun to see how a woman can cope up with herself and her surroundings in a male's body. The acting was really hilarious.<br /><br />Rob Schneider is great at acting out mistaken identities like \\"The Animal\\" for instance. He can really carry out the personalities of the other character he's playing in the movie. It's almost like he's acting 2 people in a movie.<br /><br />Basic Plot:<br /><br />Jessica(Rachel Adams), a mean teenage girl, starts off the movie with her and her friends stealing the magic earings that, which she doesn't,know can change people's identities. She wears them to a gasoline station where Clive (Rob Schneider), a theif is stealing away goods at a small food shop. She accidently drops her other earing and Clive took it. This is where the craziness begins. The next day, Jessica finds herself in Clive's body and is desperate to get her original body back while Clive is in Jessica's body. Clive uses Jessica's body to gain money at a local strippers night club.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the movie was nuts but hilarious at the same time. It's a good watch especially during boring days. Sure can make you laugh.<br /><br />Kirstie Mabitad

B00007E8V4|5.0|Another CD of theirs with meaningful lyrics and also some random songs. This CD is excellent and should not be missed, especially by fans. With songs ranging from pizza to bombs why wouldn't you love this CD? The lead singer does some crazy vocals sometimes but always makes it an enjoyable listen. It's metal of course and SOAD does not skimp on making it great. Not much really to say other than pick it up, especially if you are a SOAD fan or just a fan of metal. There are quite a few great songs but it's all quite good.

Oh, and Bobby sings a few of his own tunes - marvelously. What brain dead idiots are keeping this Concert from DVD??? Worth a $100 - or $1,000. An absolute Must Have!
B00000DHZJ|4.0|Hendrix is loved, worshiped, and hated by some.  i can't imagine  <br />how anyone could hate hendrix, but i've heard it said.  maybe he was not the exalted genius that some people try to convince us that he was, but he was a fabulous musician and even though he chose to play a sort of hard blues/rock, his music, i think, will last as long as there is music in this world.  genius? master? perhaps not.  but magical! powerful! thrilling! something to have experienced if you were there, and if not, something to discover.  i had the missfortune of being born a little late for Hendrix, but at least we still have recordings to listen to.  this cd probably cannot capture the magic of seeing Hendrix live back in those days, what album or live recording could? but it is a great addition to the collections of guitar enthusiats, other musicians, or anyone who just loves music(more importantly).  and, lets face it, even if you are not into that sort of thing, Hendrix \\"rocks!\\"  this would probably be a decent introduction for someone who hasnt really experienced much of Hendrix.

Some songs have deep inner meanings while others are just random by my reckoning. Overall you get a feelings of metal and the vocals are superb. &quot;Question&quot; I found was one of the best songs on there, with its excellent sound and tune as well as meaningful lyrics. Overall I'd get this CD, ESPECIALLY if you are a SOAD fan. But, do give it some time if you don't like it at first.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I just recently got into Spanish music, even though i am spanish, but I was never a fan until 2 years ago (I'm 15). This is a great album!!! Ive been a fan of Shakira ever since \\"Ojos Asi\\" came out and she has never let me down since! \\"Para Obtener Un Si\\", is a beautiful song with her talented voice and the instrumentals and of course \\"La Tortura\\" is also an awesome 5 star song, but  you have to admit it, Alejandro Sanz gives the song a BIG kick. My other favorites are \\"La Pared\\", \\"Dia Especial\\", \\"Dia De Enero\\", and \\"Las de la Intuicion\\".    AND THAT KID REVIEW TITLED \\"OVERRATED\\" IS RETARTED!!
B00005ATQD|5.0|Great story, acting, directing and unexpected turns. Movies containing all these elements are a rare treat these days.    You should also check out \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"The Shining\\". All these movies show the magical work of Stanley Kubrick!
B0006L16N8|4.0|This cd has some good songs like Speed of Sound and Fix You. Though, this cd is good the first couple times you listen to it.  (Like the First month or two) after that it's still good, just not as good. Overall I was very impressed with the lyrics and beats of it. 4 STARS!
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is the best I've heard by SOAD and possibly the best I've heard. As soon as I listened to each and every song I fell in love. Amazing vocals, music and lyrics. This was actually the CD that got me into SOAD and now I can't get enough of them. &quot;Aerials&quot;, the last song on the CD, is truly amazing and by far the bset I've ever heard. It has great sound and incredibly great lyrics. If you are a fan of SOAD, why are you here reading these reviews? Go out and buy it!! And if you aren't and just like rock and/or metal, no need to think twice, get it!
B0002NRRAG|2.0|Whilst I loved her voice, yes definitely shades of Billie Holiday,the compilation of material and arrangements were to my mind quite repetetive and boring. She is obviously surrounded by some good jazzmen, some of who I kept waiting to be allowed to contribute their undoubted talents in improvisation. Unfortunately, they were reigned in far too tight and for me the music never really lifted or \\"took off\\". I don't know if MP only sings ballads but it is a pity that she did not up the tempo a bit now and again. The arrangement for \\"Careless Love\\" in particular did not work for me, whilst interesting for perhaps the first refrain, to maintain the strict thumping tempo throughout was a mistake. Again, things failed to \\"take off\\"

B00005JNEI|1.0|Credibility.  That's the watchword for a documentary filmmaker, even one as publically visible as Michael Moore.  Yes, we all know the guy's political agenda, we all know he hates George W. Bush like summer hates the winter, but if Moore is to be taken seriously he has to establish objective credibility that is compelling and believable and not agenda-driven.  Plus, a \\"documentary\\" is supposed to present BOTH sides of a controversial issue, so that the viewer may make up his or her mind.  Not so with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, which I had predisposed myself to be a muck of warbling nonsense prior to viewing, yet even I could not comprehend its blatant hatred and vitriol.  In the wake of the deadliest attack on U.S. soil I was shocked, concerned, and disturbed that Mr. Moore would decide to kick a political football of diviseness. . .plus put one or two bucks in his pocket, just for jollies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong:  George W. Bush is the worst President to reside in the Oval Office since Warren G. Harding (and that's saying something).  I am NOT some politically expedient apologist who enjoys hammering leftists for the sake of hammering; I just call 'em as I see 'em, and Moore dropped a stink bomb here.  Yet, I think I know something about journalism, as I graduated with a degree in it, and I can tell those of you reading these words that Moore has systematically and enthusiastically raped all tenets of objective and unbiased reporting that those of us who labored under the guise of reporting strove mightily to obey.  This piece of sludge isn't a documentary; it's a piece of disingenous propaganda that usurps common decency.  This is flagrant. . .flagrant. . .sensationalism; the very fact Moore tries to paint a Bush/bin Laden connection without flushing out ALL the facts reeks of moral corruption and ineptitude even more telling than Moore's bashing of Shrub.<br /><br />(And by the way, Michael:  You aren't that funny, either.)<br /><br />But heck:  If someone wants to show me that the devastating attacks of 9/11 were the by-products of a corrupt administration in bed with oil-producing countries in the Middle East--a corruption intent on \\"looking the other way\\" to protect its billionaire buddies--well, I'm all ears.  Show me the money.  But Michael Moore can't:  He's too busy spinning his hatred and personal vendetta against George W. Bush.  The whole \\"film\\" comes across as contrived and constipated; yeah, Mr. Moore, we get the fact Bush Jr. ran several companies into the ground (What the heck is your point?).  Tell me something more pertinent to your alleged documentary.  What's that?  You can't?  Thought so.<br /><br />--D.

B000002L9M|5.0|Speaking as a fresh, green, bushy-tailed, brand new 80's music fan, I can say that my first experience with Depeche Mode - through Black Celebration - is AWESOME! I heard a song of their's on an 80's radio station one day and I fell in love with them. I became obsessed with listening to the song again - to listening to MORE of their songs. The song I fell in love with was \\"But Not Tonight\\" which is featured in this album, but I must say that none of the other songs fell short of my high expectations for the group. It is as one review I read so eloquently stated, liable to have many a folk commiting suicide to it's chords - aye, 'tis dark - very dark - but beautiful! I listen to it while reading \\"Hellsing\\" the manga. It's extraordinary how emotion can be packed into the songs, they are passionate and extremely powerful! I am glad that this is the first 80's album I bought. Highly recommended!

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Wonderfull adapation and transition from stage to film.  The actress playing the part of Christine Daae is magnificent.  What a fantastic voice.  Overall just a GREAT movie, highly recommended
0529064847|3.0|I've heard the pope doesn't like this Bible, and it has been fiddled around a bit. <br /> <br />Verses are missing from Job, or rearranged... it's like this with other Hebrew Scripture books. This is probably one of the worse things about it! Following more from the Protestant tradition, I would not have cared too much if the verses were rearranged in the Apocrypha. However, around late last year was the first time I read the Apocrypha. I particularly liked 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees and Judith -- Very powerful books! Tobit (Tobias) doesn't seem to carry much religious ideas in it, but it was fun to read though! <br /> <br />Too much centered around Catholic theology. The footnotes are too extensive, a bit hard to read as well.There's too many headings, divisions and commentary in this book, that takes away from the reading style. It's almost like reading a Bible commentary! <br /> <br />But it is a powerful book to read, with clear, precise language. A lot of Catholic Bibles are dynamic in translation, like the New Jersulem Bible! The footnotes, can be helpful in understanding Catholic tradition and understading the Bible passage. <br /> <br />I found the synopsis at the start of each book interesting. Comparing Greek with the Hebrew text, etc, etc. <br /> <br />This book is about 40% revived -- Psalms and the Greek Scriptures, at least my edition is anyway. Would have been interested to see what the original unrevised read like! <br /> <br />The Jerusalem Bible is the way to go! Top notch! But this is not too bad! :)
B000002NAK|5.0|Over the years Andrew Lloyd Webber has made many musicals, some more successful and appealing to the public than the others. Most people will, however, agree that \\"Evita\\" remains one of his most satisfying works to this date. Numerous reasons confirm this statement. Just like in its predecessor \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\", \\"Evita\\" is almost entirely sung-through; the lyrics are witty and appropriate; the subject matter is again a personality larger-than-life who rises from obscurity and dies at the peak of its fame, thus becoming a legend; the score is captivating and appealing to the listener, at home or in the theatre.<br /><br />And yet the road to the movie version of Evita was a rocky one: It took 20 years of negotiations with different studious, directors (Francis Ford Coppola was in the game at one point), and actresses (both Meryl Streep and Michelle Pfeiffer were considered) to make it happen. When it was finally in the bag, Alan Parker took the director's seat and Oliver Stone helped with the adaptation. Before the movie came about, we had 3 major recordings of Evita: the 1976 concept with Julie Covington, the 1978 London cast highlights album starring Elaine Paige and the 1979 Broadway cast full album with a Tony-winning Patti LuPone; all three of them excellent in their own right. This 2-disc movie soundtrack can join them as another fine recording of the material. The story of Evita is widely known, but for those who are new to this let's repeat the essentials: We follow the life story of Eva Duarte Peron, wife of post-World war two president of Argentina, Juan Peron. However, the musical is very loosely based on the actual life of the real Evita. The story follows Evita from the day of her death in July 1952, and then we have flashbacks until that moment, covering her coming to Buenos Aires, alleged love affairs, meeting Peron, being the first lady and dying of cancer at 33.<br /><br />This recording contains almost entire movie, minus the few irrelevant sequences. It boasts with several advantages. First, the whole score sounds extremely fresh and polished, probably because it uses a much larger orchestra than the recordings mentioned above and since re-orchestrations were done in a best possible way, not threatening the integrity of the score. The epic sound of this recording remains thusly unmatched, both in the musical and the chorus parts.<br /><br />Then, it shows how wisely the changes were made in order to adapt the stage version for the big screen. So we have some parts included from the concept recording that were later omitted in the stage version, mainly, \\"The lady's got potential\\", a very powerful number, explaining Juan Peron's climb to power, here used with new lyrics written by Tim Rice, instead \\"The art of the possible\\", which worked much better visually on the stage. Some additional omissions were made, for example, \\"Eva's sonnet\\" was left out completely, and a song called \\"Another suitcase in another hall\\", originally sung by Peron's mistress, is here sung by Eva, but it works perfectly, since the lyrics blend with her character as well. Some lyrics, too critical towards the Perons, were also dropped. A brand new song was written by Lloyd Webber and Rice for the character of Eva, called \\"You must love me\\", a beautiful ballad that rightfully won the 1997 Best Song Academy Award. It proves that ALW and Tim Rice were the best of collaborators.<br /><br />One of the reasons that makes this movie and the recording so successful is its perfect cast. There were numerous doubts when it was announced that Madonna will play the lead in the movie version. I've never been much of her fan, but one has to hand it to her here: she handled the role in the best way. Her voice may not have the strength of Patti LuPone, but she can certainly hold a tune. What's more, she does it really good, especially as the movie evolves and her melodies become more demanding. She actually managed to find the appropriate dose of insecurity (\\"Another suitcase in another hall\\", \\"Waltz for Eva and Che\\"), determination (\\"A new Argentina\\") and sadness (\\"Eva's final broadcast\\", \\"Lament\\"). Besides, if you see the movie, you'll find her acting quite plausible as well. Her male counterparts were also prudently chosen. Who would have guessed that Antonio Banderas can actually sing in a good manner? His Che rocks and he is as good and strong in his vocals and performances as were David Essex and Colm Wilkinson. Jonathan Pryce, the famous Engineer from Miss Saigon, is a dignified Peron, but his potential is mostly unused, because Peron is only a supporting character. And let us not forget Jimmy Nail as the sleazy tango singer Augustin Magaldi. Each of the principal singers managed to find its vocal uniqueness in a best possible way.<br /><br />The CD comes with a couple of black and white movie photos and an excellent sound quality, but unfortunately, the lyrics are not included.<br /><br />For those of you who are getting acquainted with the story of Eva Peron for the first time I must point out: Bear in mind that this musical is only loosely based on the life of the real Evita. As much as Tim Rice's lyrics are craftily made, they lack a lot of historical accuracy. As a historian I became very interested in Eva Peron's life story so I did some research after seeing the movie. It turned out that the authors based their entire work on a single book called EVITA: THE WOMAN WITH A WHIP by Mary Main. It was based on rumors, lies and myths, written with the single purpose of slandering Eva Peron as much as possible. It contains no footnotes and no bibliography. The authors used it mainly because it was one of the few books available on the subject in the English language during the 70-is. So one should be very careful in making any conclusions based on the musical or the movie alone.<br /><br />So, conclusively, this Evita soundtrack and the whole movie show just how musicals are supposed to be transferred from the stage to the screen, with the changes done in a most satisfying way. Also, it emphasizes just how important the right casting is. Some of the reasons why many fans of Lloyd Webber's \\"The phantom of the opera\\" (myself included) felt that the movie version of it wasn't satisfying were the fact that Gerard Butler just didn't have the right vocal equipment for the score, nor the looks (he looked more like Elvis Presley than like the Phantom), combined with some poorly made changes to the material. It's amazing how much a badly chosen cast can ruin the best musical materials. We can only hope that Lloyd Webber won't make the same mistakes with his upcoming movie version of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\". This brings us back to Evita movie soundtrack. All the pieces of the puzzle were assembled rightly and it really shows. Because of that, the musical theatre fans should find an empty spot on their CD shelves with no trouble.another hall\\", \\"Waltz for Eva and Che\\"), determination (\\"A new Argentina\\") and sadness (\\"Eva's final broadcast\\", \\"Lament\\").

0765310015|5.0|Steven Erikson is amazing!!!  His story is complex, engrossing, lively, wonderful, complicated, action-packed... totally out of this world!!  I LOVE IT.  I love his characters, their development, the themes, it's just too good to describe.  His scope and mastery at weaving together unrelated events is terrific.  Once you start, you'll be hook.  Give it a try.
068987474X|5.0|This book had the answers of what i was wanting to know. \\"Men don't forget how much they like you, so put down the phone!\\" fits me just well!
0062502182|1.0|The book is not only simplistic without being charming, but it is flawed in a variety of ways that can be downright dangerous. I refuse to waste any more time pointing out specifics. I wasted enough time reading the book. It was so painfully boring I could not take more than 3-4 pages at a time, but struggled to see how far stupidity can go. Let me say just this: it is for the lazy-minded, mediocre, self-centered many who dream of being God (the character actually says that!!!) and manipulating others to serve them.  <br /> <br />Let me ask all the \\"enchanted\\" readers one question: if this is such a spiritual tale, why do we need the actual treasure at the end??? If it is about self-discovery, why do we need \\"precious stones, gold masks adorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded with jewels, the spoils of a conquest that the country had long forgotten\\"????? Don't labor to answer. I'll do you a favor and give the answer away: because it is for those who, although they want the solid gold, they like to think that they are enlightened beings of a superior kind. What can be more dangerous?  <br /> <br />Everybody else: Keep your kids away from this book!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I'm not exactly a nu-metal fan, more of the opposite, but soad sounds so unique musically that even I find it worthy of my attention. Seriously, in the entire crappy genre of nu-metal there is NO band that sounds unique, except for soad. That's an achievement, so that's why I'm rewarding em with 4 stars... also cause it's a good album by the way.<br /><br />But for the rest, try to ignore what they're singing about, it's pure nonsense. Bashing the US government and kapitalism while profiting their a$$es off with platinum after platinum. You don't have to agree with the US or something but damn, come up with some arguments at least, because like this, their lyrics are utter taurifaeces. \\"why do they allways send the poor\\" for instance from BYOB, what the hell do they think? US soldiers poor? unmotivated? what the? Nevermind, here's the conclusion:<br /><br />Ahem... Allthough soad's lyrics are hypocrite, VERY hypocrite, still... you should judge a band by the music, which I hereby did.<br /><br />4/5
B0006GAO3G|3.0|Muy buen elenco, particularmente la pelicula me gusto mucho, pero es un tipo de humor que no a todos les gusta.
B000002UAU|5.0|Those honors would have to go to \\"Revolver\\" or \\"The Beatles\\"...what I would like to ask is how anyone that listens to any of the Beatles music from \\"Rubber Soul\\" onwards can say that it all sounds the SAME?? Totally absurd....I think these individuals need to clean the **** out of their ears and recognize diversity and invention in music when they hear it!!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The film is positively magical -- excessive, obsessive, unapologetic in its pure gothic romanticism, and gorgeous to watch, with sublime music.  It will be immortal -- along with The Red Shoes, and Tales of Hoffman.  It demands complete and utter surrender. All the acting and singing were extraordinary, and the story itself has a great smoldering and unforgettable power.  Seeing this film took me right back to childhood when my mother told me the whole story of The Phantom of the Opera based on the early films she'd seen before my time.  Not a single disappointment anywhere.  It seemed a perfect delivery of Andrew Lloyd Webber's genius.  What courage it must have taken at every stage to conceive of and execute something so pure and sensuous and divinely extreme.  A real demonstration of what might happen when brilliant talent pays no attention to cynicism or pseudo-sophistication.
B00005JNSK|3.0|Nope, the title had nothing to do with it- I just felt that it would be a good franchise clash collaboration since FREDDIE VS. JASON which I think they never cooked that well.    Anyhow, awaiting the next movie installment for J.K. Rowling's HARRY POTTER flick adaptation... we'd get treated to a number of notable movies to look forward to (including Jodie Foster in FIGHTPLAN (seems to be really something))- like another set of digital (and non-digital) flicks again by the likes of ICE AGE 2 and VALIANT from the makers of CHICKEN RUN, live action movie adaptation of C.S. Lewis's CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe (in which ive been fond of from the animated feature done by the makers of SESAME STREET - The Childrens Family Workshop) from Disney; and a pair coming in from director Tim Burton - CORPSE BRIDE, and this one, his own rendition of Roald Dahl's children's classic CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, since his flaky effort with the remake for PLANET OF THE APES.     I've expected that this movie would fly off, but it runs with the feeling that it could've been even more better, kinda like his (Burton's) adaptation of SLEEPY HOLLOW and yet still I'd rather prefer that old fave 1972 rendition WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY which features Peter Ostrum in the role of Charlie, and commedian vet Gene Wilder as Willie Wonka himself- no matter how 'dated' it may seem.    In this movie some better feel or emphasis from its characters should've sufficed that it could use some, but indeed it lacked just the right ingredient about that.    However, the movie did have some good choreography about, and just as with the effect of the 1970's flick had on me- Ive stacked myself with some chocolate and anything chocolate so's not to  frustrate my appetite for from watching the film= there's a dialogue between Depp as Wonka and Mike Teevee- who said 'they expected that would come' as they are bumming around, that kind of pulled a lot of pun from Burton.   Furthermore, I don't want to give a lot away - but there's a certain lotta further thing with Christopher Lee's appearance in this film- surprisingly.      With what comes as Burton's cast of regulars as such, this time Danny Elfman as Burton commisioned him again- did a better turn of variation with his musical work for the movie this time, in whose score at times made Elfman provided for its vocals; that at times sounded nearly like my fave band- (hence mainly for the Umpa Loompas) SUPERTRAMP during the time they're still with Roger Hodgson.     However none of them songs from the previous movie version appeared here, there's no Cheer Up Charlie, no I've got a golden Ticket, no Candyman- and most of all none of that SOng i NEVER REALLY liked...    there is no Pure Imagination.       RATE = 7 out 0f 10
6304806418|5.0|A work of genius on every level, this film combines music and cinematography in ground breaking fashion.  Madonna is perfect in the role, and bears a very strong resemblence to the true Evita of history -- delicate, beautiful, and immensely popular. Her voice is superb and her acting flawless.  Banderas is irresistible as always, and everyone else does a fantastic job.  Webber's music is genius, of course, and when we have it combined with brilliant editing and a thrilling cinematic pace, the effect is hynotic and very simply gorgeous.  We get the mystery of the historical figures, the seductive nature of power and fame, and the horror of death all majestically and magically interwoven to make great and original film. Never have I seen scenes choreographed to music quite like this.  A masterpiece.
B0000028RR|1.0|Jeez, these guys are obviously HUGE fans of the Urban Dance Squad; In fact so much that Mr. Morello memorized almost every of their riffs from his coke trips to Amsterdam. Too bad he had to saddle them with juvenile political rants from some disgruntled chicano who got beat up as a kid by his white boy neighborhood.

B000003TA4|5.0|I have waited a long time for this cd. I am NOT disappointed one bit. ROCK ON!
B00005JNTX|3.0|With it's pioneering visuals, there is no doubt this movie is quite simply gorgeous to look at. It's plot isn't terrible, with three basic story lines that draw you in as much as the character's narrations of their situations. A bonus to this orginal film is the easy-on-the-ears dialogue; there's a relatively small amount of profanity for an R-rated film. <br /> <br />But, it seems all good things have their downsides. As word truthfully has it, \\"Sin City\\" is a very graphically violent movie, reminescent of guest director Quentin Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill\\" volumes. The film is riddled with nudity, pedophilia, strippers and creepy prositutes, and let us not forget cannibalism. Mixed messages also plague the screen (tinted with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor), telling us (once again) that personal revenge is sweet, and it's okay to get it by whatever means, especially by grotesquely killing like no tomorrow. <br /> <br />This film has only a couple of positives (not benefits, mind you), which can never be worth that sinking feeling you have after watching it, if you have any moral conscience at all. <br />(pluggedinonline.org used as additional reference) <br />
0385512058|5.0|I was extremely impressed with this networking book for a number of reasons.  Primarily, unlike other \\"self-help\\" books, he doesn't repeat himself.  You get 298 pages of thoughtful and intelligent advice.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Christopher Nolan finally nails the director's part. This is what we've been waiting for; quality without sacrificing quality. A perfect blend of \\"Glade freshness\\", talent and skill, and interpretation. <br /> <br />These people actually used what God gave them: a brain. They got a virtual unknown that adds flare to the part of the Dark Knight. Bale is both strong, mysterious, and talented. I couldn't be more pleased he signed a 3-picture deal to continue the Batman legacy.  <br /> <br />The story is great, as well as the story, cast, writing/directing, and morals. The best Batman since \\"Batman Forever\\", this one's definately worth your time, and money.
0385338082|4.0|Can you keep a secret?  I love to read these books from time to time.<br /><br />Emma is the perfect character for this book.  She proves truly \\"gripping\\" as she attempts to negotiate her career, friendships, family and love life.  She knows what she likes and dislikes, even if she is unsure (identifiably) what she might like in the future.  For the most part she's happy, until...<br /><br />She has a rocky flight and tells all of her secrets to a stranger, who, like the back of the book will tell you, ends up being the president of the multinational company she works for.<br /><br />He flips her life around and thankfully so.  Up until about the fifth chapter, I felt like I was reading another version of Shopaholic (which I loved as well).<br /><br />Great book to read on the beach, over your lunch hour(s) or under a shade tree in your back yard.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Since I don't know his earlier work I have no preconceptions. On my first listen, I find this album a refreshing combination of brilliant lyrics and excellent production. Leonard Cohen definately writes inspired lyrics, but equal credit for inspiration and musical brilliance goes to his collaborator, Sharon Robinson. Her voice and key tracks really stand out on this record. The best complement I could make is that this combination makes me imagine what it might be like if Tom Waits made a record with Oleta Adams, who some of you might remember made her stellar debut collaborating with Tears for Fears on the Seeds of Love album and then released the  fantastic debut record Circle of One. I would love to hear more from Sharon Robinson, I have no doubt we will. Kudos to LC for his vision and insight as well.
0380778556|4.0|This is a timeless classic.  Very eery and yet touching at the same time.  The heroine is easily someone you can identify with.  I also enjoyed watching the movie after finishing the book.
B00005K3OT|2.0|\\"I enjoyed the movie on its own sweet level, while musing idly on the box-office prospects of a film in which the glowing, life-affirming local Christians prevailed over glowering, prejudiced, puritan and bitter Druid worshippers. That'll be--as John Wayne once said--the day.\\" -- Roger Ebert  <br /> <br />\\"Chocolat\\" is a paint-by numbers tale of of a confrontation between a village dominated by humorless, legalistic, pleasure-denying Catholics and the pleasure-seeking, chocolate-making Juliette Binoche who seeks to liberate them. The Catholics are for the most part wooden and sterotypical, though not portrayed as outright evil. It all plays out predictably. The ironic thing is that this day in age it is often the politically correct secularists who are the dour puritans while religious people are the ones who just want to be left alone to enjoy life.  <br />
6300270696|5.0|Ladyhawke is one of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion.  It is not campy nor predictable, as many historical pieces have been.  The storyline is imaginative, the players phenomenal (especially Matthew Broderick in his finest role and one of the truly great roles of film in general; he should have won an Oscar, imo), the cinematography rich and stunning, and the directing right on target. My only nit is the music.  Though I have enjoyed Alan Parsons's work in the past, his style doesn't mesh with the mystical mood of this film, particularly the opening piece.  The music becomes less noticeable the further you get into the movie, maybe because the story is so compelling. If medieval mysticism draws you, this is a must-see.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched \\"Band of Brothers\\" over my vacation last Christmas and thought it was one of the best things I had ever seen on film. The episodes, from basic training to The Eagle's nest are all great -- the best being \\"Bastogne\\". This series will be required viewing for my son before sending him out to make his way in the world. It teaches about perseverance, bravery, sacrifice, and the brotherhood that can only be formed in the crucible of war. I have been spared this in my lifetime and I hope he will be, too, but other men still experience it in Iraq as I write. Parents should be advised that the series is not appropriate for young children as there is a lot of battlefield violence & profanity. There is also one brief, gratuitous sex scene that should have been left out (Spielberg also did this in Schindler's list). Overall, however, the good far outways the bad in this great series. Watch the special features, too, especially the interviews with the real soldiers who are portrayed by the actors.
0743201140|5.0|I've read many books on how to succeed in business and this one tops the list.  Yes, a solid business strategy and vision is important, but when all is said and done, it's people executing the strategy that makes it all happen.  Leveraging individual strengths is not only the most cost-effective way to deliver on a strategy, it's also the best way to challenge and retain key employees.  Homerun!!!!
078322737X|5.0|I have to agree with the majority of reviewers who rave about this film. The story of one night of cruising in a 1962 California city hasn't aged a bit in the 33 years since it was first released. I \\"saw\\" this movie several times as a kid, but it's meaningless until after you've been out of high school for a number of years. The cast is great, the script is great, and the music is great if you are a fan of early rock & roll. Ron Howard is a fine director, but moviegoers have really missed out since he quit acting. Young MacKenzie Phillips is fabulous. The scene where Charles Martin Smith attempts to buy Whiskey is classic. Very enjoyable.
B0001NBMEE|4.0|Prince Valiant is old school Hollywood - when good was really corny Christian Vikings and evil was the Black Knight (who was also probably a Christian) in league with a group of not quite yet  Christian Vikings.  This movie is a lot of campy fun with over the top performances by Wagner, Mason and Leigh (she is just magnetic for Hollywood Vikings, it seems!).  That being said, there are two really wonderful scenes near the end of the movie that combine a very stirring score with spunky action on the part of Robert Wagner (the vindication for his really bad hair day during the first 3 acts of the film).
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I actually saw this musical in New York as a kid (in the early 1980's), and I remember sitting in the audience wishing I could play Annie - I think most girls my age were wishing the same thing...<br /><br />Then, several years ago, I saw the DVD version of this musical, and I fell in love with it all over again.  Each member of the cast is absolutely perfect for their role, and they each play it to the hilt!  The music is great, and it's quite hard to stop yourself from tapping your feet and singing along!<br /><br />Annie is about a little girl who was left at an orphanage when she was a baby.  The living conditions in this place are absolutely horrible, and the woman who's supposed to be looking after these kids doesn't seem to care about them in the least.  All she cares about is money, booze and men!<br /><br />In comes a wealthy man who always takes a child from the orphanage each christmas and lets them live in his mansion for a week.  He usually chooses a boy, but this time he sends his assistant to get the child, and she spots Annie right away, & chooses her to come to this amazing palace.<br /><br />Annie is such an adorable kid - inside & out - that the entire staff at the mansion fall in love with her, and eventually, even the millionaire's heart melts for her.  He's decided that he wants to be her father.  But the \\"den mother\\" of the orphanage wants to stop this at all costs, and she devises a plan to make a lot of money, and get Annie back all at the same time.<br /><br />Will Annie ever get to be adopted?  Will the nasty orphanage \\"mother\\" get her way?  What about all of the other kids that are stuck in that horrible place - what will become of them?  I won't answer any of these questions, as I don't want to ruin it for you if you've never seen it.  Suffice it say that this a wonderful movie, and the endings not one to be forgotten...<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, as well as those who are looking for a great movie for \\"family night\\" - it's one of those movies that the whole family will enjoy.king for a great movie for \\"family night\\" - it's one of those movies that the whole family will enjoy.
B00011F5DK|4.0|We have been playing Blockus since we got it...unfortunately, it really can only be enjoyed when four people play....the directions for 2 or 3 players require you to play TWO positions each or to share the remaining , untaken position...and play is then pretty awful...but what a game with four players..fun, strategic, lots of offense and defense all played an a great looking and feeling board...we have even taken to playing in the pool...with the board on a pool raft (all parts are plastic..).  The game also depends on each player having 21 very specific and individually different playing pieces...and some are very small and I live in fear that one piece will be lost and the game rendered completely unplayable...except for the two aforementioned caveats, I love the game and it would have goteen five stars...
6305878323|5.0|Although I am in my mid-thirties now, I still remember my family watching this movie TOGETHER every single time it was shown on t.v..  I capitalize \\"together\\" because, even back in my day, everyone was so busy that to sit together for anything was a major feat - and I truly cherish these times with my parents.<br /><br />Mary Poppins is a wonderful musical that is appropriate for everyone - regardless of your age.  The songs are so upbeat & fun that you'll find yourself (and everyone else watching) tapping their feet and singing along.<br /><br />This movie is about a family in need of hiring a new nanny for their 2 children because all of the other nannies were scared away by the jokes these kids played on them.  In reality, the children are really in need of a bit more love & attention from their parents, and are acting out in an effort to get rid of the nannies so that their parents will start parenting them themselves.<br /><br />This is where Mary Poppins comes in...  She is the one who's hired for this job, and she is able to give the children a sense of love & peace like they'd never known.  She also has some \\"special powers\\" that enable her to create fun out of anything!!!<br /><br />Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke are absolutely amazing in this movie!  They both have such a stage presence, and they mesh perfectly together.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, as well as those who are looking for a great movie for \\"family night\\" - I'm sure it will be a hit with everyone in the house!
B00005JKHP|3.0|I thought the DVD release was good for what it is...  i was pleased with the improved visual effects and scenes but was not happy with the fact that we don't have the option of viewing the extended VHS version with the original audio and visual effects.  pleased with the finished products all in all...  especially the Starfleet Headquarters shots, the Wormhole sequence and the Enterprise's first encounter with V'ger.  as i said i would hope that Paramount releases the original extended cut on DVD for all the star trek purists.
0553212737|5.0|Jane Austen's, Emma, is about an upper-class young woman from the 18th century.  She is the protagonist and makes a hobby out of match making.  By doing so she injures her companion, because she is blind to other peoples' feelings and opinions.  Emma is a benevolent character, but she is incredibly misguided.  The only person who can criticize her is Mr. George Knightly.  They have grown-up together and their relationship develops as the novel progresses. <br /> Most of the plot is propelled by Emma's antics and schemes to contro the people around her.  Comical witticisms pervade the novel.  The more Emma attempts to steer her peers toward certain paths the more she discovers her own lack of direction.  The theme of marriage is evidents as it is the central focus for nearly every character.  Some renounce it while others advise prudent matches.  In the end, Emma must stop wielding others and concentrate on her own ambitions regarding marriage. <br />  <br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading Emma.  I also read Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey.  Both of these paled in comparison to Emma.  I found myself with a perpetual smile on my face as Emma got herself in and out of mischief.  She is so likable that I was constantly rooting for her.  She was great because of her fallibility.  Her mistakes weer always out of good intentions. <br /> The novel is romantic, yet not in an effusive way where there is some Adonis spouting sonnets.  It is more subtle and underplayed.  It is above all a story about society.  I learned a lot about the role of women in this time period.  Emma is extremely intellectual and her only outlet for her intellect is in trying to play Cupid.  Also, a woman's solitary means of advancing her situation is though matrimony.  This explained the emphasis on connections.   <br /> The only character that slightly peeved me was Mr. Knightly.  He is the handsome \\"prince charming\\" and mentor to Emma.  It is his infallibility that makes him so aggravating.  Knightly was always right and Emma was always wrong.  I wanted her to be  right for once and laugh at him for being precocious.  This, of course, never happened.  Ultimately, Emma is one of my favorite historical fiction novels.
B000935TV8|5.0|Within a few seconds after pressing the \\"play\\" button for this CD, the sound of a percussionist beating the tar out of the tympani emergeged from my speakers. The waps and thumps are intermittenly interrupted by an orchestra on steroids. From there this production goes on a musical romp that I regret hearing come to an end. I'm not sure if this is authentic French baroque; but as a musical listening experience it is a blast. Great sound. Great energy. Wonderful music.
0440180295|5.0|I chose Slaughter-House Five because a friend of mine that attends another scool has the same sense of humor that i have reccomended the book to me along with most anything by Kurt Vonnegut. <br /> <br />The book is a reliving of a young soldier(Billy Pilgrim)'s tale of life as a young child and eventually as a soldier that lives through the infmaous Dresden bombings of East Germany killing more people than the atomic bomb in Hiroshima did. The novel is not historical. Billy Pilgrim has an epiphany of sorts that allows him to travel sub-conciously back and forth in time, experiencing all his good and bad events in a random series of pages or paragraphs. One page he was a young employee for his wife Valencia's father, te next he left his optometry room to appear in the front lines of World War 2. Billy has a stay in a mental asylum after his \\"efforts\\" in the war where he meets an avid science-fiction fan: Elliot Rosewater. He grows fond of Elliot and his ficticious novels of aliens and space travel. The author of the books he loves is one Killgore Trout, whom emphasizes aliens and time travel the same way Billy sees it. The     Trafalmadorians teach Billy to become \\"unstuck\\" in time and that his death and many others is simply one moment in life; only one moment in a collection of infinite moments that have no boundries of time. Billy is taught by the Trafalmadorians to change his human perspective of the notion of time and existence and simply enjoy every moment; live every moment.  <br /> <br />I loved the book. Essentially it was partially intended to be na attack on the Dreden bombings and in general war workings. The way Vonnegut describe's death of soldiers, civilians, cats, dogs, heroes, and fools is simple and uniform: \\"So it goes\\". It implies a humour that's rarely personified with such gruesome situations. He even shows the reader melodramatic war campaigns that soldiers greet with disgust and distaste (the exception being a Ronald Weary; chubby and patriotic, Weary is ironically abandoned by fellow troops he tries to help [they, also ironically, are shot and killed shortly after trying to avoid Weary and sure capture]). Perhaps as important if not more so is the psychotic side of Billy Pilgrim's experience, who simply gives up living life in any given moment. Perhaps insane from war (or \\"alien abduction\\") Billy still offers themost sane perspective of all the books characters, who Vonnegut describes as \\"non-characters\\". The best example of such perspective is his gay parade around the city of Dresden after the horrendous slaughter occured, wearing Cinderalla azure boots and a bright yellow cape. Even as the most insane person Billy sees the war in its simplest as a massacre. Billy cries as a simple child would at the site of a dead parent at the end of the novel in utter awe.

0385510454|1.0|Rarely do I get half way through a book and just quit.  I just couldn't hang with the plodding plot, repetition and boring do not a good novel make.
006441034X|4.0|I go to any Miyazaki movie and so went to see Howl's Moving Castle. The movie ended up quite confusing in places and when I discovered that he'd gotten the story here I bought the novel. <br /> <br />Ms. Jones' writing is superb, her imagination impecable and her sense of wonder intact after all these years. While not The Hobbit or Redwall, it is a fine story with more depth perhaps than the other two. <br /> <br />However, be sure to see the movie first else you'll be quite disappointed since it doesn't follow the book very closely and loses a lot for that reason. <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|I love this album!!!!  All the songs are great.  I highly recommend it.
B000002H33|5.0|Each of Metallica's albums has a slight change in style, and while this still an stellar album it personally is not favorite of their styles.   But that is just preference, because no matter how you look at it this is a real masterpiece. <br /> <br />The one song that stands out the most to me in this album is the self titled one \\"Master of Puppets.\\"  I and many metallica fans consider this to be their greatest work.  The song is so varied and so well put together it reminds me of the masterpiece \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in someways.  Each part isn't just good by itself, but it works really well as a whole.  Also the song is a real joy to play as a budding guitarist... <br /> <br />All in all, a great album, worth every penny.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|I was born the year this album was released, and quite frankly it has the power to produce a longing desire in me that is so intense that I would be worried about health effects; if the feeling wasn't so good.    To the independent mind, to the seeking spirit, to the self-examined soul, this album is a giant honey pot filled with the fruit of psychedelic bees.      The music is like an audible glimpse of the gravitational field that pulls between love and death, and at times the members of the Airplane seem to be just channels, through which flows life's rarest, dearest and most mysterious elixer.    The indescribably subtle power that so many know in Jerry Garcia also flows through and out of this album, and anyone who has decided to stand with the kind, loving people of the planet needs to own this.
B00004TEUX|5.0|Peter Maag! Wow. I didnt know much about this conductor. In this 1960 recording, he conducts the formidable London Symphony Orchestra in a vibrant and spirited Mendelssohn program- The Third Symphony and Incidental Music to Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. Both works seem to flow into each other, despite the fact they would otherwise not sound well in the same CD. Midsummer NIghts' Dream is the seller here though. It sounds gorgeous. The English are proud of this particular work because of its basis in Shakespeare's classic comedy/fantasy. Mendelssohn was also Queen Victorias' favorite composer and he was himself English/Jewish. The music is perfectly suited to the play. The Overture is thrilling and romantic, sounding a lot like a synopsis of the entire work even using themes played out later in the work. The Nocturne is so placid and soulful. The Wedding March is famous, of course, and the way its played here is just wonderful, full of vigorous clarity and beauty. The only other good recording of this is an EMI release I believe conducted by another Brit Andre Previn. The cover has an old painting of a scene from the play- Oberon and Titania in the forest surrounded by their entourage.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I didn't really know much about this movie going into it. I missed the theatrical release, but had heard good things about it. So, I was patiently waiting to see this movie. WOW! This movie was amazing. This is one of the most exciting, intense, and beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. I was absolutely rivetted. The characters and story are wonderfully brilliant. Not to mention the way they shot it. Genius. <br />I was a bit disappointed that they didn't come out with a better, more special feature-packed, disk to begin with, but I was glad to get to see this movie and highly recommend everyone checking this one out.
0425200477|5.0|I am not a dedicated Christie fan.  However, for those are interested in puzzle plot mysteries in the cozy tradition, this book is like Hamlet or Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  Accusations that Christie \\"didn't play fair\\" completely miss the point, for this is one of the most entertaining books in all of genre-fiction.
0156027321|5.0|I worked at a summer camp over the summer and another counselor was reading thie book. I read the back and was quite intrigued( but as you will see, it is hard not to be). <br />   The story is called Life of Pi. Pi is a boy living in Pondicherry, India. He was born and raised as a devout Hindu and lived in a zoo. To clarify, his family owned the zoo and his dad was the zookeeper. He lived most of his life analyzing human and animal behaviour. As a matter of fact, many of his life lessons were through animals. The most important being the danger of those very animals around him as portrayed by a lion eating a goat. As his life progresses, he becomes interested in other religions, namely, Christianity and Islam. He liked the idea that God in Christianity was like every one of us and willing to sacrifice for us. He also liked the Islamic philosophy that God is everything and even you are part of god. In so doing, Pi gets into a litttle trouble, when his three religious advocates meet. Utimately, Pi follows all three. Then, however, there was a lot of political turmoil in India. Pi's father decides to move to Canada, and to move all the animals elsewhere. They board a Japanese cargo ship and set sail. Unfortunately, the ship sinks and Pi's family along with it. Pi ends up stranded on a twenty foot lifeboat with a Hyena, a wounded zebra, a female orangutan, and a 450lb Bengal tiger. That is when the fun really begins....Pi has to learn how to survive in the middle of the pacific threatened by the very animals that he had lived amongst all his life. <br />   The novel is truly interesting. All of the methods Pi uses in the book and scientific facts he uses are true. Yann Martel really did his research. Also the book analyzes how a castaway would deal with loneliness and fear stranded in the Pacific. I feel as if after this book that we take so much for granted and our own problems are insignificant. The book touches on many facets of life through religion, youth, fear, death, and self-preservation(physically and mentally).

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Most of the political and other details of this album have been covered already. I cannot emphasize this enough: this album is so wonderfully dense that you CANNOT get any kind of grip on it without listening to the whole thing many times. System's music is so complex, so deep, and so creative that it is impossible to understand all, if any, of it the first run-through. This is what elevates System above almost every other band out there today. They're not out to spit out a bunch of superficial feel-good tunes that have almost no musical, emotional, or intellectual value. And I think the fact that their albums are so short yet they top the charts is more evidence of their high quality. Each band member and each song is extremely unique; all their songs don't sound the same and none of the band members sing or play the same way throughout a whole album or even throughout a whole song. You can never be bored with System. There are so many layers to their music, especially in this album. Each time you listen to it you will discover something you never heard before, and will love it even more.

1591391105|5.0|This book teaches readers what a new manager is to do in the first ninety days of his/her tenure so as to succeed in an organization. This book presents a few propositions about new leaders taking on new jobs. They include the following. (1) The root causes of transition failure lie in the deadly interaction between the situation and the new leader. (2) There are systematic methods and techniques that a new leader can learn and use to enhance a successful transition. (3) It is important to build credibility from the very beginning. (4) Companies should develop a standard transition framework for their new managers so that the company is a level playing field for promising new hires. As a result, success is not merely due to the accidental placing of a person in a situation that happens to be a good match to his/her skills. Having successful new managers will eventually return great benefits to an organization. <br /> <br />The author goes on to teach the detailed techniques involved in such a transition. Handling such a situation is very similar to doing a SWOT analysis tailored for a new leader coming on board. Overall, the new manager is called to handle one of the four major types of strategic situations: (1) start-up, (2) sustaining success, (3) realignment, and (4) turnaround. Each calls for a different set of emphases and techniques. Further, he discusses how a new leader should get along with his/her new boss, subordinates, and team members. Moreover, personally, the new leader should mentally acknowledge the fact that he/she has been promoted to this new position and also take care of the home front to ensure a smooth transition for the whole family.  <br /> <br />The information presented in this book is clear and logical. Most chapters start with the same format: a short case and a list of common mistakes made by new leaders. The text is supplemented with tables and diagrams for enhancing understanding. The writing style is quite academic.  <br /> <br />Overall, the author has given some important guidance to readers on this important topic of handling a transition successfully.
B00005JNTX|5.0|lets be honest here... You more than likliy know if you are going to enjoy this movie before you even read my review... hell you probably knew if you would like this film just by looking at the cover art for the DVD. Sin City is a world where the good guys are murderers and the bad guys are worse. Where no matter how far down the gutter your life has gone, there is always one last shot at redemption. Where bullets fly, blood sprays, and jazz music plays in the background. Not everyone will enjoy this film, in fact I would go so far as to say that the movie is more of an \\"aquired taste\\". I commend Robert Rodriguez for having the guts to make a movie with such high production values and expensive star power, while knowing this film is far from the main-stream, and will probably only be appreciated by a select few. you, the reader know what kind of movies you enjoy, and If you are the type who likes the movies that your friends never quite understand, Sin City is a world you must experience. However, Seeing as how the current cut of the DVD only has the movie and a short featurete on it, I would encourage a delay in purchase, as It is rummored a Director's Cut is not far down the line...
0393035158|4.0|The first 2 chapters (Reason in Exile, The Nature of Belief) provide an excellent indictment of religion in general as an affront to reason and common sense.  Especially notable is the criticism of \\"moderate\\" religion, which is all too often excused as acceptable because of its lesser degree of violence.  But Harris effectively portrays moderate religion as cowardly half-assed practice, where the believer simply conveniently screens out distasteful elements from the same sources that build the faith.  Even more importantly, religious moderates are preventing an honest confrontation with extremists, because moderates are effectively endorsing even extremist forms of their own religions by failing to criticize the common bases they all share. <br /> <br />The next two chapters (In the Shadow of God, The Problem with Islam) review the horrors wrought by Christianity and Islam during the last several hundred years, such as the Inquisition and terrorism, and remind us that although some of the violent tendencies have alleviated over the years, the motivations for them have remained and in many cases strengthened. <br /> <br />The fifth chapter (West of Eden) exposes the role of Christianity in the irrational \\"War on Drugs.\\"  Although it makes many good points, evidence is rather lacking in this chapter.  While the author uses excellent reasoning, we readers still must take his word for important assertions. <br /> <br />The last 2 chapters (A Science of Good and Evil, Experiments in Consciousness) take a bizarre turn into academic philosophical meanderings.  Not being an experienced student of philosophy myself, I had difficulty making much sense of them.  I understood points here and there and followed the overall chain <br />of logic just fine, but I found myself relying too much on the trust I had gained in the author.  He definitely makes good important points about the value of philosophies like Buddhism (which I am especially sympathetic to, being a Buddhist myself!), but I'm not sure how effective his arguments would <br />be to someone less familiar with the topics. <br /> <br />These last 2 chapters would probably have been better off in a new book. They wander far enough from the main topic to detract a bit from the more straightforward and immediately applicable messages of the first half of the book.  That is the only reason I rate the book at 4 instead of 5 stars. <br />
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Short and sweet. I knew what was going on before I got to the end but did not tell the person I was with so it does not count. <br />   See if you can figure it out....so, from that point...yea....check it out but as for artistic capability, life enriching material or in thing other than blood guts and the endless insanity of Psychotic Killers either not on their medication or tired of prescribing it.......okay....give it a try. <br />      I left feeling empty and dissapointed at the totality of all this suspense flop has to offer. <br />       Although I will give it a thumbs up on blood and gore. <br />
0060005688|5.0|Schwartz elegantly explains why it can be advantageous to make decisions in life without knowing all the information.  It is not an excuse to dismiss reason or evidence, but rather a strategy of \\"choosing our battles.\\"  Most interesting to me were the accounts of marketing studies showing that consumers prefer a smaller selection of familiar choices to a larger collection containing more \\"optimal\\" choices.  The parallels to everyday decision-making in other arenas make an important analogy. <br />
B00008EY65|5.0|Pearlman and Blair as well as a Cast of various Eccentrics makes this movie just the break you need from the boring norm without drugs.<br /><br />  Hellboy is a believable lovable Imaginary Character played by Pearlman...whom I was not really familiar with until this film and somewhat surprised Why? He works magic.<br /><br />  A must for everygirl that wants a potential suitor to understand how to behave.<br /><br />  He is loveable and in someways very believable.<br /><br />  Blair....Is cutting edge in what I consider raw talent. Maybe what some would consider newcomers. This was my first Experience with her and she has a genuiness that is real. I believe she also has a new movie on the horizon. She was on Leno recently  and has gone to a more Hollywood Polished look. That is always sad to me in some situations this one included. It is nice to see talented genuine women that there beauty comes from individuality not makeup and cosmetic similtries.<br /><br />  The Creative talents, believability and The Humaness of<br /><br />Hellboy the character is so refreshing for those who hold the ideoligy that Satan is Just Satan......Hellboy gives you what I consider a better understanding.<br /><br />  Also for Romantics....dare I say Hopeless.......This also will fill you up. There is a one liner at the end of the movie that I am currently trying to best capture for my wall artistically.

B00005JNSK|4.0|CHRISTOPHER WALKEN  <br /> <br />Everyone I know agrees with me as far as who should have been casted as Willy Wonka.  Johnny's pretty good and all, but Mr. Walken def. fits the bill for a weird, hilarious, and lovable eccentric.  I honestly couldn't think of anyone better to succeed the original fantastic Gene Wilder. <br /> <br />***************************************************************** <br /> <br />Otherwise, a great movie, 'cept I thought it was kind of a shabby ending and that it also kind of dove a little too deep into Willy Wonka's past. <br /> <br />And WHERE was the burping cola scene?  I guess it wouldn't have fit the ending anyways.  I think Mr. Burton sacrificed a wonderful scene for the rather schmaltzy ending.  One change I did like was that he showed what happened to the kids, not included in the original. <br /> <br />Corpse Bride looks awesome.  Will see.
0671015206|5.0|I have heard people refer to this book before, and decided it should be part of my summer reading. I found the information fascinating, and am now reading The Millionaire Mind. Basically, the authors tell us the reality of people with wealth and more importantly how they got it and retain it - which contains many myth-busting facts. The information presented also reinforced our family's method of living - and although we are not millionaires, we are PAWs (prodigious accumulators of wealth) - according to the formula presented. A great read!

B00005JNTX|3.0|Why I keep allowing myself to get suckered into seeing Tarantino projects is entirely beyond me, because this had so much potential to be a film noir homage but got ruined by the extremism and goofiness of comic books.  The whole environment isn't consistent to any particular era: for example, most of the cars are '50s vintage, but there's one modern Ferrari thrown into the mix.  Carla Gugino and Jaime King get the look of the average film noir femme fatale down, but Alexis Bledel looks like she would have been more at home at an Avril Lavigne concert.  It's never fully explained why the beat cops in this wear riot gear as the standard duty uniform in some bad echo of the [[ASIN:B0001VTPWM Robocop Trilogy]], or why the hookers of Old Town have a ninja assassin on their side.  None of the dialogue felt natural, with lines like \\"I love you, [insert blonde girl's name here]\\" and \\"Show them you're worth a damn\\" used repeatedly by multiple characters across all three different stories; in fact, the only good dialogue comes from a couple of goons who speak with an eloquence not seen from their segment of society outside of [[ASIN:6305364613 William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet]].<br />If you want good noir, stick to the originals like [[ASIN:B000FFJYA2 The Big Sleep]] or the neo-noir stuff like [[ASIN:B000HC2LHG Body Heat (Deluxe Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000UBMSB8 Blade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)]].
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I don't get why people nowadays say they hate a movie just because it was popular and a big blockbuster.  Of course its not one of the top 10 movies of all time but its The Iliad.  Some people try to justify how they dont like the movie because it is 'farfetched' or 'unrealistic'.  Well I'm pretty sure the Iliad was an 'epic' and achilles is an 'epic hero'.  So of course when everyone thinks achilles, the strongest soldier from both armies, gets cut down by hector of course the entire battle is going to stop.  My point is if you go into this movie with an open mind and in a good mood you will enjoy this movie.  Its very entertaining with lots of action and I personally enjoy seeing how they portray certain famous characters.  Also Brad Pitt is just a thug in this movie.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie has evrything, blood, gore, freaky contact lenses, and a whole lot of humor. There are scenes, like the one in the garden, that'll make you laugh until you cry. Even though there's British humor that as an American I dont understand, it's still great. All the hype people gave this movie is true.
B00003BDXG|1.0|Can't believe this movie gets rated as highly as it does. It could have been good. I have no problem with ultraviolence. I also enjoy innovative camera work when done well. I just hate the way this movie was filmed. The attempts at being \\"artistic\\" consist of whatever effects Stone could throw at the screen. Quick cuts, superimpositions, jerky faux-handheld work, grainy b/w interspersed with jarring but pointless color saturations and slow motion instant replays, ad infinitum. <br /> <br />Usually I could ignore this and enjoy the narrative of the movie OR ignore whatever plot / character development there is or isn't and just focus on the visual riches. But in the case of this flick, there is not enough substance to either aspect to make it watchable on either (or any other) level. <br /> <br />I dunno, maybe I was just too old when I first saw it the year it came out (I also just watched it minutes ago to see if my opinion of it would have changed. It hadn't) If I had seen it when I was a teenager maybe it would have been cool. Instead it comes off as trying to be all deep and hard but instead it's just ridiculous looking. <br /> <br />One good point is that the cast is great and the acting is well done. It's just that everyone in the cast lowered themselves to be in this dreck. <br /> <br />If Tarantino had directed, we could have had something here.

B000000JO3|5.0|Not many can match the energy and angst these two releases from Minor Threat convey. Just listen and you'll realize how 'pop' Green Day really is. This is REAL Hardcore Punk music. The way it was always meant to be. Non- conformity. Balls. Attitude. Intelligence. Originality. Raw and untamed music from a better time, where musicians weren't afraid to creatively portray a different point of view. Now buy the CD and experience one of the greatest Hardcore Punk bands of all-time. Period.

B00004XONN|5.0|The other two best albums by Radiohead are OK Computer and Hail to the Thief. This is my opinion though. The others are darn good too, but not nearly as much as these 3. Pablo Honey is pretty good for the time it came out, but Radiohead never made a weaker album after it. The Bends is very good, the last track is really amazing. Amnesiac would be my fourth favorite after the big 3. Its just a really cool sounding album.<br /><br />Kid A is my favorite album they ever did, even over OK Computer, because nothing really sounds like it. Its really cool and unique in its own kind of way and Treefingers, not my favorite song but, it actually stuck out to me, some other reveiwer said it was most peoples least favorite radiohead song, but I enjoy it, I think its in a movie, but I still don't really know which one. I remember one day I was sitting alone in my room facing the radio listening to this album really loud and it gave me chills. There is just something about it that blows me away. . .<br /><br />Amazing Album = Everything in its right place, The National Anthem, How to Disappear completely, Optimistic, In Limbo, Kid A, Treefingers, Idioteque, Morning Bell and Motion Picture Soundtrack. The first couple songs listed are the best.<br /><br />Kid A is up there as one of my top 20 favorite albums, others for example are... stones/beggars banquet, beatles/white, smashing pumpkins/mellon collie, hendrix/electric lady land, zeppelin/III, The Who/The Who sell out, Grandaddy/Under the western freeway, Modest Mouse/Long Drive..., Sabbath/Master of reality, Pink Floyd/Ummagumma, Stones/Let It Bleed,Zeppelin/II, Flaming Lips/Transmissions of..., Pink Floyd/Animals  etc...

0345442989|3.0|This book, as many other reviewers have noted, is primarily about Palpatine's insidious political manipulations in the days prior to his revealing himself as the notorious Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. <br /> <br />Although there are a few enjoyable side stories to keep one entertained for a little while, most of the book is about politics and the various maneuverings and actions surrounding politics. With the knowledge that Palpatine is the Sith Lord, he is revealed to be a genius who obviously has a firm idea of what the future will hold...and how to manipulate it to his evil ends. With that said, the book is pretty complex, with a vocabulary to boot.  <br /> <br />I'm a teenager, and had a relatively difficult time understanding much of the plot, which left the book for a while to be an empty read for me. I did sit and think about the plot a lot, and in the process I think I gained some understanding of some pretty interesting topics; though I'm still lacking in the \\"ah hah\\" kind of revelation that fully opens one up to the story. <br /> <br />So, if you enjoy thinking and striving to understand things, then this is the book for you. However, if you enjoy understanding what you read, and don't have the time to ponder it a bit, then this might be more of an annoyance than a humdinger. In addition to this, it could also be said that the author doesn't do a spectacular job in his writing style to present the story; and really, in my opinion, the only factor that makes this book a 3-star book is its elucidation of Star Wars events that were before unknown.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is just delightful! All of the songs are beautiful. It is truly a treat for the ears. the only thing that is a slight dissapointment, is that they did not include one of the songs from the concert, which was one of my favorites. My favorite song on the CD is Nella Fantasia, sung by Chloe Agnew who is all of 15, and has a voice like an angel. I also really loved the voices of Lisa Kelly, and Orla Fallon, who also plays the harp beautifully.I recommened this CD to all.

This text is both difficult to read and out-of-date. <br /> <br />Rather, I recommend \\"C: A Reference Manual\\" Fifth Edition (Harbison & Steele).

B00064WSNW|5.0|I first discovered KC through its softer tracks, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" \\"Epitaph,\\" etc. So when I first heard Discipline, it was a bit of a shock to the system.<br /><br />However, after the strangeness of the opening track \\"Elephant Talk\\" the band hits a powerful groove and stays there for the rest of the album. As the tracks crescendo, you suddenly realize that KC stays melodic even when they're at high volume and being avante garde. This makes for a great late night study aid, when you need some rhythm, but need to stay awake as well. Problem is that you really need to listen to Discipline at high volume to really appreciate it, which doesn't go down well with sleeping neighbors...<br /><br />All the tracks are excellent. My favorites are Frame by Frame and Thela Hun Ginjeet.

B000059XUO|5.0|Last night i was watching TNT, and I caught this movie at 1:00. Man was i suprised.I had never heard anything about brandon lee except that he had died on the set of this movie, and that they had to use doubles and digital insertion of his face to complete it. What a great job they did with it. The acting in this was very good supringly for a superhero horror movie with a star whose career apparantly had flustered before this. It was one of the most intensly sarcastic,and sad performances ive see. You can totally simpathize with the character, which makes the violence all the more justified. The gang dudes did some bad things to Eric, and they deserved the violent ends that they got. He has some classic dialog. the villian is menacing to, very evil indeed, who i dont know but he had a role in Alien Resurrection. Ernie Hudson was good as the cop who befriends Eric because he understands his dilema. The cinematography was good to. the city that the Crow stalks is dark and grimy looking, perfecly fitting the mood of the story. Some scenes just really have a power to them just thanks to the production. like the Crow wears all black and a black trenchcoat. in one seen his young friend gets kidnapped and he bursts throught the church doors with this heavenly white light bathing him. it like symbolism for the character. The action is good in the movie to. This director has seen atleast one John Woo movie, but what i like about it here is that it is not overdone. The Crow doesn't have to dive around and slide across the floor, even though he does have a gun in each hand. He gets lit up with a thousand bullets and just keeps coming. this is a shootout that occurs towards the end and it is very good. there is one image in this movie that i thought was just dynamite. After the Crow eliminates one of his killers, he lays down gasoline in the shape of a crow and lights it on fire. They then get one of the coolest shots in a movie ever with an over head and slightly angled camera shot which shows Eric in his leather cloaked coolness looking down at his sign. Pure gold. When you see this it is sad to think that Lee died , because he displayed genuine talent here, and could have been great. But in the very least, the last movie he was in is was a great tribute to a talented young man who could unfortunetly couldn't continue his career. He will be remembered though. 5 starsshot which shows Eric in his leather cloaked coolness looking down at his sign. Pure gold.

B00000I2UC|3.0|\\"Automatic\\" is my least favorite JMC album, which, perhaps, is a testament to my opinion of the band, because I think it's quite a bit of fun.  I just think most of the songs sound quite similar, and, besides occasionally wonderful electric guitar work, consist of \\"paint-by-numbers\\" type instrumentation.  Basically, the Reid brothers are taking fifties and sixties type melodies, and dressing them in new wave attire.  At times, Jim Reid sounds like a poor man's Billy Idol, who probably could have sung these songs better.  The Stone Roses and Raveonettes, to name two bands, had better results with the same concept. <br /> <br />I do especially like two songs on the album: \\"Her Way Of Praying\\" (which I believe is the first time that JMC referred to one of the individuals from which they derive their name), and \\"Head On.\\"  If you don't feel like listening to the entire album, these two songs will give you the gist of it. <br /> <br />Fortunately, the band's next album, \\"Honey's Dead,\\" would be much better, and is still my favorite JMC album.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I Don't like writing long reviews so this is gonna be short so first of all i've never really liked this kind of music but my best friend kept on talking about them (A7X) till I finally listened to \\"Burn It Down\\" and \\"The Beast And The Harlot\\" which are two of my favorite A7X tracks now my favorite being \\"Bat Country\\" which is a great track. I have to admit at times M. Shadows' voice is SORT OF annoying but thats barely and it really sucks that before this album he hurt his vocal chord but I personally like ti better than hearing someone scream ;D but overall this cd is great and its worth buying!
B0007GAERG|2.0|I like Mariah. I think she is a very talented vocalist. I love a lot of her songs. I was however disappointed with this one. I have heard better from her. It's Like That was alright. We Belong Together was good. Shake it off and Fly like a bird are my 2 favorites off of this cd. It just seemed that every other song began to sound the same as the other one. It was hard to distinguish from one track to another. There are some good ones though. Check it out and see what you think

0060537639|1.0|Being an avid history reader and currently living in China I picked up this book wanting to know a little more about the Chinese voyages. This book however is total rubbish. Menzies makes up the most bizarre evidence to prove his theory of Chinese ships sailing all over the world - unfortunately all the evidence he presents he then conveniently states has been lost. <br /> <br />Menzies turns to the ridiculous when he has trouble adapting his theory to innacurate maps in the Carribean - so he simply lowers the sea level by 8 ft due to global warming between now and 1423 and claims the maps then match closely with modern maps - however in the next chapter he explains that the proof that the chinese circumnavigated Greenland is that it was much warmer back then and the ice had melted!!!  <br /> <br />Back and forth he goes repeating and contradicting himself time and time again - I must have read the phrase \\"60 years before columbus\\" about 50 times throughout the book. Another annoying aspect of the book is his peurile and arrogant manner of writing - everything is due to his unique ability to read maps and all evidence presented is \\"irrefutable proof\\" of his theory - the language is amateurish and annoying and actually makes the text hard to read. <br /> <br />I read it on vacation with some friends and I must admit we havent laughed so much in a long time as we discussed the content and Menzies vivid imagination. We wanted Menzies to write another book on UFO's or perhaps use his ability with maps and winds to tell us who shot JFK - but in the end we decided it would be better if he simply crawled back into his submarine with his ubiquitous case of rum and retired for good. <br /> <br />Dont waste your money on this book - its simply that - a money spinner by the publishers - it should be put on the shelf next to the Chariots of the Gods.
0465011020|3.0|I purchased this book to help me understand the life of a North Korean; by one of their own who could verify the horrors I had heard existed. It is not a lengthy, in detail, or novel like story. It is a cold, stark, very glad I don't live, there type of story. It indeed sustantiates the inhumanity and horrors of living under a failed communist state.
B00005LK94|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! The first time I saw it was when I was a kid, maybe 7 or 8 years old, and I still love it. My favorite part is when she and her dad fly the geese to my home-state, good ol' North Carolina (YAY!!!! N.C. rarely gets fame.), and when her dad runs out in the yard in his under ware. FUNNY. Like every time I watch it, I start crying, cause its so sad. I have the VHS, and I plan on getting the DVD soon. By the way (this is off-topic, but what the heck), like I said, I do live in North Carolina, plus the pond behind my house is full of Canadian geese. Anyways, good movie!
B000002KD9|4.0|After The Gold Rush (1970.), Neil Young's third studio album<br /><br />One of the greatest, as well as underrated, artists of all time, Neil Young's contribution to plenty of types of music, from hard rock to folk and country, has been immense. After buying Neil Young's big selling album, Harvest, which has become one of my favourite albums, I was persuaded to get some more of his albums and see how they measure up. 'After The Goldrush', Neil Young's third studio album, released in 1970 is another album from the 'Harvest' era, with Neil Young playing out many country/folk numbers and it is definitely another excellent and deservedly respected effort by Neil Young.<br /><br />After spending the early part of his career in Buffalo Springfield and then CSN&Y, Neil Young decided to put more time into his solo works (although he was still with CSN&Y at this time). 'After The Gold Rush' marks the starting of Young's long time partnership with backing band 'Crazy Horse', who he still plays with now and also a collaboration with guitarist Nils Lofgren, who was at the start of his career. 'After The Gold Rush' is very much a folk styled album, with hints of country and harder rock thrown in (which Young would use more in later albums). Neil Young originally got the idea for the album after seeing a screen play entitled 'After The Gold Rush' and he penned the songs based around the story in the play. This includes themes such as in the `Southern Man' track which was an attack by Young on Southern bigotry but also there are short sing along styled songs like `Cripple Creek Ferry' and `Till The Morning Comes'. Overall the album marks the birth of Neil Young becoming a great song writer, which he would prove even more so in albums like `Harvest'.<br /><br />So how do the songs in this folk-styled album measure up? Opening the album is a nice acoustic song `Tell Me Why' which has lots of good harmonization and makes a good opener. The title track is next up, `After The Gold Rush' is a beautiful but remarkably simple track consisting just of Young singing, a piano and a bit of French horn. The song is really peaceful and relaxing, in no part due to the slow pace and great lyrics. `Only Love Can Break Your Heart' is a catchier song with a classic Neil Young beat to it, again it is another folky sounding but relaxing song. The best song of the album is next though; `Southern Man', apart from being the most rocking and intense song on the album is very powerful, especially when you consider the themes of the lyrics (As I've mentioned earlier). After this, we are back to the slower paced songs, firstly with the short `Till The Morning Comes' which acted as the closing track to side 1 of the original LP. Following this is `Oh Lonesome Me', which, is the only track on the album which was not penned by Young himself. Young sings in a lamenting fashion in between a great mouth organ part. Next we have `Don't Let It Bring You Down', another classic Neil Young sounding track with quite a strong beat. Young's lyrics are quite cynical on this song. `Birds' makes a great follow up track, another piano-vocal song with a fantastic harmonizing chorus. For the next track, the pace picks up; `When You Dance, You Can Really Love' is another more rocking track, again pretty intense with some nifty piano play in parts during the song. `I Believe In You' is another relaxing folky song and is then followed by the album closer, `Cripple Creek Ferry'. OK this song is only just over a minute long but how catchy and addictive is this song! I have a general fixation with really short tracks anyway but this has to be one of the best I've heard, a great closer and by no means a throw away!<br /><br />Neil Young's `After The Gold Rush' is a fantastic album and deserves all of the praise it has been given over time. Personally, I prefer Young's next album, `Harvest' much more but this album is still an excellent collection of songs, some simple and heartfelt, some intenseand striking. Neil Young has proven to be an massive influence on plenty of artists and bands, not to mention being termed the `Godfather of Grunge' and you can see why with his awesome songwriting ability. Its hard not to like an album like this so I would recommend it to anyone but especially to any fan of acoustic/folk rock. Don't miss out on this gem of an album!oven to be an massive influence on plenty of artists and bands, not to mention being termed the `Godfather of Grunge' and you can see why with his awesome songwriting ability.

B000002UD0|4.0|I haven't really been a real fan of John Lennon's work.  To tell you the truth I enjoy George Harrison's solo work a little bit more because it's a little different.  My sister was the one who told me to listen to some of Lennon's solo work.  Now I have always loved his work with the Beatles.  I have listened to the album \\"Imagine\\" and thought it was alright, it was an over-rated album in my opinion.  I have listened to every Lennon album out there and this is by far my favorite and his best work.  I think the song \\"Steel Glass\\" sounds a little to much like \\"How do you sleep\\".  Overall, it's an awesome album I don't think there's a song on here I don't like.  Another good album is \\"Mind Games\\"  I enjoyed that as well. Yay for John!

B0002OERI0|5.0|This is one of the most incredible albums of rock I have ever heard. Hands down every song on this album will blow you away. There is not a song that is worth skipping, and whats even cooler is that the entire album tells a story (I'll let you figure it out). If you dont own this album, buy it now!!! It is well worth your money, even if you dont like there music. After you buy this album go and buy green day's Internation Superhits, because (though highly unlikely) it is better than American Idiot.
1400086035|5.0|Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life.  Excellent narration, sprightly character voices and the reader's sense of good fun make this recording my personal favorite of 'A Christmas Carol'. <br /> <br />If you enjoy this then pick up more of Mr. Dale's audiobook recordings.  I highly recommend all 6 of the Harry Potter audiobooks *on CD of course as you will wear your tapes out & replace them constantly* and 'Peter & the Starcatchers'.
B0000027RL|5.0|A friend of mind told me to check out his favorite band about over a year ago. I had only heard a few of their singles(like most everyone) and enjoyed them but never really listened. He told me to start off with Ten and work my way up to Riot Act so I can experience the band's growth like the fans from the beginning did. I have to say, that's the best advice I could give anyone who wants to check Pearl Jam out. If you want to get into Pearl Jam this is the best place to start. <br /> <br />First of all, you probably know their main songs like Evenflow, Jeremy, and Black. Those are great songs, though a tad bit overplayed even now, and Alive remains as my second favorite PJ song. The guitar solo at the end lasts for over a minute and it gives me the chills every time. <br /> <br />Rest assured, though, those aren't the only good songs. 'Once' is a great opener and it's a part of the Alive song trilogy. 'Why Go' is excellent as well and also has a nice short little solo that gets the blood pumping. After Jeremy the CD puts you on a roller coaster of both slow and fast paced songs. The last song, Release, is certainly a very soothing song that makes you feel the emotions PJ is putting forth. <br /> <br />The lyrical content throughout this CD is certainly thought provoking and Eddie Vedder does an amazing job singing. He is, without a doubt, my favorite singer of any band. This CD is a classic and should be in any rock fans collection. Though it's not my favorite PJ album it is up at the top of the list. There is no bad song and at a day and age where most music sounds the same this can come as a breath of fresh...err...old air.
B00005ASOI|2.0|I go to many horror film websites and mesage boards, and I am always assaulted with reviews about this film. It seems even a new generation of horror fans seem to think they aren't a real genre pro if they don't like this film. So, it is about a ballet school run by Beulah Ballbreaker. Tacky late 70's overkill on the colors, looks like Willy Wonka meets Liquid Sky. Take away the colors and sets, and what do you have? A long, boring film. I am afraid I will have to discredit any reviewer who includes this as the greatest film ever made. This film is to horror movies, what American Idol  is to the indie music scene, a total annoyance. Run for your life if you come across a person who says this the greatest film, they haven't a clue what they are talking about...if you come across a website citing this as the best horror film, click exit and keep searching for new sites. I know a lot about Italian cinema, yes I am a Lucio Fulci fan. So I know this just doesn't stand up to all the praise. Granted it is good and probably better than Hollywood films on many levels, but what the hype is all about I do not know..

Aided by an excellent cast, the story unfolds in a mesmerizing and totally addictive manner, drawing the viewer back again and again to relive the experience.  You will not be disappointed in this DVD.
B000003TBP|5.0|There are four singles on this CD. They are \\"Devils Haircut\\", \\"Where Its At\\", \\"New Pollution\\", and \\"Jack-Ass\\". There are about 8 songs on this CD that are great. Besides those songs some other notables are \\"Hotwax\\", \\"Derelict\\", \\"Novacaine\\", and \\"Minus\\" are excellent tracks as well. This CD is like his new one \\"Guero\\" and His old one \\"Mellow Gold\\" so if you like those two albums you will like this one for sure. The most known song on here would be \\"Devils Haircut\\". Overall this is definitely his best work he has accomplished and will be very hard to even match. This is where you should start with listening to Beck.

B00003CXB7|5.0|This movie was a cornerstone for the movie community. It brought a new type of movies to the world when it released in 1970. MASH was originally a book by Richard Hooker in the 1950's. The book followed a MASH unit in the Korean conflict. This new MASH concept was being used for the first time in the police action.  The MASH units had very high success rates, bringing hope to the GIs who fought there. The movie was a combination of antiwar sentiments against the Vietnam War, with the serious and deadliness of war and with the history of the MASH units in Korea. The movie touched many and was a first in it's kind in it's context and it's almost humorous point of view against war. It was unlike most of the war movies where they would show the heroes, but in actuality in war there are no heroes only dead and those scarred by it. This was a wonderful movie that cannot be copied. It will affect us now as it will years to come.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Walk down the right back alley and you can find anything in Sin City, the tagline of Frank Miller's entertaining B&W/Color action packed triumph. One of the most violent movies I've ever, but a breathtaking amazing experience, I saw it in the theater and I've never seen any movie like it before. It was very different. A thrilling and electrifying story of detectives, hookers, crooks and others in a dark city who get a dose of their medicine. An allstar cast including Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and Mickey Rourke. If like action and good comic book story telling, then this one of the best ever made. It's like a dark Dick Tracy. experience the adreline rush and the excitement of this must see and own comic book triumph.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey- known as the voice and the best selling female vocalist of all time has finally found her place at the top of the charts.  In the 90's Mariah managed to establish herself as a major force in the music industry to the extent that she became the most respected singer of all time.  Her early music was lyrically deep and emotional, and she put her message across by recording her music in the ballad format.  In the 2000's Mariah's popularity declined and her unique and elastic voacls lost the breathtaking edge that they once possessed.  But for all those people who doubted her ability to bounce back, Mariah has recorded an album that displays her strength and versatilty as an entertainer. <br /> <br />Mariah appeals to her original fan base who have followed her career since her self-titled debut, and this is because her signature style is evident on every track.  Her five octave vocal range is displayed on each and every track, from the silky smooth vocals on the first verse of 'One and Only' to the audacious ending of 'Fly like a Bird'.  At this point Mariah is a powerhouse and her ability to project her voice and sing piercing high notes is a highlight of the entire album.  Yet she appeals to new fans who may not have been attracted to her heartfelt and compelling ballads such as 'Hero'.  Mariah is able to sound amazing and contemporary due to the fact that she works closely with some of the most respected names in Hip-Hop music.  Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Jermaine Dupri and Nelly have a strong presence on the album.  This adds a hip-hop feel to the album and there is a winning combination of stunning vocals and top production work. <br /> <br />In terms of substance Mariah is an intelligent artist who takes creative control of the project.  Each song is deep complex in some way. 'We Belong Together' is a reflection of the heartache that overwhelms us when we desperately need to rekindle a romance that has been lost.  It talks about love but it does so ina sophisticated and mature manner.  The lyrics are simple yet painstakingly crafted to the point of perfection.  Mariah's voice captivates the world and this is a triumph in in its field.  'It's Like That' opens the album and it is a very commercial piece of work.  The production work is infectious, but personally it is not one of the best tracks that features on Mariah's back catalogue.  Mariah sounds best on 'Circles' and 'Joy Ride' and this is because her voice is sounding as original and exciting as it did when she first released a record.   <br /> <br />The album is simply the best one to be released this year because as you hear the music you realise that no other artist could ever compete with Mariah.  This sound is rare and outstanding

0778321606|4.0|With a renewed interest in knitting on my part, and having enjoyed several books by Debbie Macomber in the past, I recently read and enjoyed The Shop on Blossom Street.  And whether you're an old time knitter or this is your first time learning to cast on and purl, I do recommend you read a book which blends a hobby with personal friendships.<br /><br />The Shop on Blossom Street books tells the story of a young woman and cancer survivor who opens a knitting store.  Offering knitting classes to attract customers, three women come to the shop to learn how to make a baby blanket.  But these three women couldn't be more different or come to the classes for different reasons which don't necessarily include learning how to knit.  And we as readers watch as these three women learn the stitches, watch their baby blankets take shape, and find themselves learning more about each other, helping each other with their projects and influencing each other's lives.  By the end of the book we find them forming lasting friendships and we know we won't soon forget these knitters.<br /><br />Similar to the premise of Debbie Macomber's book, Thursdays at Eight which I really enjoyed, The Shop on Blossom Street while  somehwat perdictable was a good journey and satisfying destination.  The best part is that the sequel, A Good Yarn, was recently published and I look forward to reading this shortly.
1587990717|3.0|Taleb wrote: \\"Almost all the book editors who read the draft recommended changes at the sentence level (to make my style 'better') and in the structure of the text (in the organization of chapters); I ignored almost all of them and found out that none of the readers thought them necessary -- as a matter of fact, I find that injecting the personality of the author (imperfections included) enlivens the text.\\" It's a shame that Taleb didn't follow such sound advice. The book would have been shorter, a lot shorter, and more readable. Had I been the chosen book editor the first two chapters would have been dropped entirely or maybe condensed into a two page introduction. The whole of Part III would also have been dropped and maybe used as the seed of an autobiography. In what remains, the references to people who speak in broken English with Middle European accents would have been dropped. My parents were two such people and it didn't caused them or anyone else any harm. <br /> <br />With the issues of style and manners out of the way, let me say that there are a couple of interesting ideas in the middle section of the book but no practical suggestions. For example, Taleb shows that a dentist would be happier if he only looked at his stock portfolio less often: once a month better than daily and once a year better then monthly. But what is the dentist to do if he self manages his portfolio? No word of that. <br /> <br />One idea that I found most useful was to use expectations instead of probabilities to chart a portfolio but I had figured that one out before I read the book. <br /> <br />The book revolves around black swans, unlikely events, being more common that predicted by the accepted financial dogma. Once again, I'm not sure he told us how to harness black swans, only to beware of them, but they are random and thus not predictable. Reminds me of a dog chasing his tail.
B00004YX0R|5.0|I really can't understand the previous comment about \\"period instruments\\". The instruments used for these interpretations ARE such: <br /> <br />Violin : Petr Messiereur (Peter Guarnerius, 1703) <br />Violin : Jan Kvapil (Laurentius Guadagnini, 1741) <br />Viola : Jan Talich (Laurentius Guadagnini, 1742) <br />Cello : Evzen Rattay (Stradivarius, 1690) <br /> <br />\\"Of course\\", this information is not available at the poor booklet that comes with the box. <br />I think this recording is one of the greatest around, right after the legendary Vlach and Vegh interpretations- which are, quite unfortunately, both rather poorly recorded. <br />This cycle is both finely recorded (analogue at its best) and fantastically interpreted- so it deserves 6 stars for the preformance and 2 stars for the package. The average does not sum up to 5, but I do give 5 stars, simply because a better compromise is simply impossible to find...
B000957O82|2.0|Wow.  What a let down.  After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie.  I saw it last night and almost fell asleep.  I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie.  I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film.  Will Smith was way too smooth and Amber Valeta should stick to modeling while she still has half her looks.  Even if this was truely funny, all the funny parts have been shown on TV Trailers for so long, that the semi-good parts weren't new to me.  I'm sorry to disagree with you all, - this was a big waste of time.
B000089RVR|4.0|This is a beautiful album, with White Flag being my favorite.
078322687X|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  I remember seeing this movie one Saturday night years and years ago at the movie theatre.  I did not want it to end.  I can't completely explain why it's so good, but it is.  The chemistry between all of the characters was great and it has a good mix of funny and touching moments. Almost as good as the movie itself is the main song.  Don't You Forget About Me is still a favourite song of mine and each time I hear it, I think of this movie.  Don't laugh, but the cutest guy of them all, was Anthony Michael Hall.  He was a cool nerd.  I can't understand how any person who's actually watched this movie from go to woe, couldn't like it.  It's a classic.
B00092ZL80|5.0|This dual dvd concert is truly a wonderful addition to my collection.  A friend first, loaned it to me to see what I thought about it.  Within 10 minutes of viewing, I got on amazon.com and ordered it for myself.  As a side note, I received it in two days without special shipping arrangements.  Both Chicao and Earth, Wind and Fire sound almost the same as they did when they originally made these hits.  Sure, a little of the voice has left, but the instrumentality of both groups is still quite strong, even with a few members not present.  This dvd concert is a great value and a must for any 60/70/80/90's collector.  Enjoy! - Glenn C. Manuel
B00000DRA9|5.0|This is an excellent CD!! The music makes you vividly recapture scenes in the movie. And the music is so beautiful, a definite treat for the ears! I definitely recommend this CD, especially if you loved the movie like I did! And if you haven't seen the movie, this soundtrack will make you want to see it!!
B00004U8P9|5.0|Another one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. After being a box-office flop when it was first released it slowly became a cult classic, and for obvious reasons. Tim Curry's performance as Dr. Frankenfurter may be the greatest performance in the history of motion pictures, rivaled only by Bela Lugosi's \\"Dracula\\" and Marlon Brando's \\"Godfather.\\" This is excellence taken to the limit and beyond. The songs are great. Curry's impersonation of Judy Garland at the end is awesome. I'm not gay; hell, I'm not even a liberal, but I respect greatness and I'll acknowledge it when I see it, especially when it's such transcendental greatness as is exhibited here.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is truly a 90's classic.As I write this review I'm listening to the album and thinking \\"In a world that has seen war, government corruption and corporations destroying people by taking their money and their hopes and dreams with them to their new mansions, that you can say who can step up and confront these problems rather than looking away?\\" I remember that back then Rage Against the Machine turned out heavy yet poignant music that many other artists wouldn't touch, from police brutallity, corruption, prejudice and sweatshop abusers. Now 5 years since they broke up, is when we need them.Their music was beyond words, Tom Morello can literally make his guitar sing.The heart and soul of the band lied in the hands of their songwriter and lead singer Zack de la Rocha whose voice transcended anger yet you could not help but to listen to the message he wanted people to visualize what they never saw in society. One thing lately that has bothered me is Limp Bizkit coming out with an album that they say sounds like RATM.To me it sounds like a sorry excuse why 5 years ago you sold out and now claim your musical rebirth is the bomb.Limp Bizkit can't even stand in the shadow of Rage, Fred Durst could not write a song that doesn't sound corny(remember Nookie). At last if you want a great, serious metal band of the 90's press add to cart.  P.S ,Don't listen to the people who rated this albuma 1 star,their musically \\"igna'ent\\" with no taste in music.
B0000541AM|5.0|The Warriors is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.  It just is, I can't explain it.  It's not a literary masterpiece, but it's definitely a cinematic masterpiece. The intensity is unparallelled; there is not one moment in this movie where you can even take your eyes off the screen, much less get up and go to the bathroom.  The city of New York is as much a star of this movie as any of the remarkably talented and charismatic actors.  I loved this movie so much I bought the book by Sol Yurik.  The book is nowhere near as intense; it appears to be a book for teens and young adults and is quite mild compared to the movie.  But God bless Sol Yurik for writing the inspiration for this cinematic masterpiece. Yes, it's a little dated by today's standards; today's gangs would all be armed with automatic weapons.  But that doesn't leave much room for a plotline, does it?  Watch this movie; you'll be glad you did.    ADDED NOTE: The above review is for the original, classic version of the film.  I haven't seen the Director's Cut, and from the sound of most of the reviews, I don't plan to.  I don't like tampering with the original when the original is already perfect.  I didn't like it when they did it to the Blues Brothers and the Godfather either.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Anyone who gives this movie less than five stars is obviously not qualified to give an opinion on the subject. This is THE science fiction movie of the 1950's, and the prototype for the entire Star Trek series.  The only possible competition for this movie would be The Day the Earth Stood Still, which is also dynamite, and is also copied after a famous book--the New Testament.  But comparing the two, I'd have to give the nod to Forbidden Planet, at least for the special effects, especially Robby, although I couldn't argue with anyone who preferred TDTESS.  Those are the two great ones; let the other 50's sci-fi movies fight over the leftovers.
B0009UC810|5.0|This movie is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and it obviously doesn't need any help from me to enshrine it in the place of highest honor that it so richly deserves and has obviously already achieved. But I'd like to say a few words about it that may not have been said before.  I just recently heard Eric Clapton's version of \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" on his newest album release. It has the exact same groove as the Blues Brothers version, but it's just not as good as the Blues Brothers' version.  The Blues Brothers' musicians were the best in the world--they are the crew from Watts-Stax who played on those classics by Booker T, Otis Redding, and every other R&B star who ever mattered.  Hell, Steve Cropper WROTE most of those songs.  When the Blues Brothers movie first came out they were criticized for not having enough soul to sing those songs.  Now in retrospect they ARE the standard against which other performers are measured and fall short. Even Clapton. How about that?
0060012218|5.0|This is a book that is destined to be a movie (and I mean that in the BEST way!).  I loved the characters, and once I started reading, I could not stop.  I could SEE everything in my mind.  Hollywood, are you listening?  Stop what you're doing and film this thing NOW!!!
0571202284|5.0|We got this for the animation team in our studio. Great addition. Cut through the crap and gets to the point. The author gives very very practical illustrated advice and tells you what to focus on and what to avoid. <br /> <br />A MUST for any animator or Digital Artist trying to understand the principles of animation. These are the kind of hand books we need more of.

Next time I'm being operated on, I'll ask for this instead of gas.

B0006L16N8|1.0|Earnest but trite lyrics, expansive chords, falsetto singing to convey emotion - no, it's not the new U2 album, it's the band  formed in their image who are currently battling for that emptiest of prizes, Biggest Band in the World. Trust me, if that many people like you, you must be doing something terribly wrong. <br />And anyway, isn't one U2 enough for this world? This is music to listen to with your slippers on. Anyone under the age of 25 who likes this needs to listen to something by The Blood Brothers as something badly wrong has gone wrong in their teenage years. <br />If you are over 25 and like this stuff, don't worry, it's still not too late. Take a Blood Brothers album twice a day for two weeks and the decline in your musical health should be sorted out.
0060751967|3.0|The plotline was exciting, but the actual execution of the story, not so much.<br /><br />I tend to have four settings for reading romantic fiction.<br /><br />1.) Can't put it down, stay up all night, cancel dinner<br /><br />2.) Can't wait to finish it, but can function<br /><br />3.) Have a difficult time getting into and finishing it but<br /><br />  end up enjoying the story anyhow<br /><br />4.) Can't get past the first third of book throw it away/donate or sell it without finishing<br /><br />\\"How to Marry A Millionaire Vampire\\" fell somewhere between 2 and three for me. I loved the plot, but the execution was off, and I can't put my finger on exactly why.<br /><br />This is definitely worth buying though and I look forward to following the evolution of the Kerrelyn Sparks, but this book isn't a keeper.<br /><br />I decided to review it because all of the reviews were 5 star -- and I feel that is misleading. It's a good book with a rehashed but interesting idea, but it isn't a five star book.
B000002H6C|5.0|After the tragic death of bassist Cliff Burton in that stupid bus accident, it seemed as if the fate Metallica was doomed, but their fourth album, the first to feature the new bassist, Jason Newsted, ...And Justice for All, proved them wrong.    There are many who believe the production is poor, and when I first listened to this album, I'd agreed, but then it grew on me, but don't get too excited, since although I can now tolerate it, it doesn't come anywhere near the greatness of Master of Puppets in terms of sound quality.  Here, Metallica takes on a bolder, more militaristic sound for the most part, which is a good thing, since it fits the powerful lyrics (which I'll mention later) marvelously.  When they do try to thrash in the faster \\"Blackened\\" and \\"Dyer's Eve\\", the results end up extremely raw, maybe a bit too raw, but still solid.  Still, when they pick up speed (but not thrash), you can still tell it's Metallica, even though the music is different.  The problem is, it's very difficult to hear Jason Newsted's bass playing, which thus removes the musical depth, resulting in a rawness that could've been improved.  Fortunately though, Lar's drumming has significantly improved.  His patterns can be brutal, catchy, and brilliant all at once, which helps the musical quality impressively.  The solos are also better than ever, and even though they don't come out as frequently as they did in Master of Puppets, they shine when they do.    The lyrical quality has improved further.  Metallica's vocabulary has expanded significantly, which delivers some of the most insightful words James has ever spoken, which is why the melodic ballad, \\"One\\", is highly considered Metallica's greatest song ever written.  I thought \\"Fade to Black\\" from Ride the Lightning was a masterpiece, but \\"One\\" is really like an improvement over that song, as it covers the views of dying even more impressively than its predecessor.  The content now sees the controversies of politics in the title track, \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", and \\"Shortest Straw\\".  I'm usually a fan of political content in music, since it makes the band stand out brilliantly, and Metallica is no exception when it comes to that, and when they view upon a young James Hetfield and powerfully ask his parents to stop treating him poorly, the results are still mesmerizing and strong.  These powerful words that come out of James' mouth will surely inspire many people.    Because of Burton's death, Metallica dedicated a near-instrumental, \\"To Live is to Die\\" to him.  It opens with a Celtic guitar solo (it also ends with that), but then turns into a stellar, bold instrumental that goes on for about eight minutes (!).  And speaking of that long playing time, the average song length on ...And Justice for All is even longer than that of Master of Puppets, yet thanks to the musical diversity, it doesn't feel boring and tiring.    With all things said, not even the loss of Cliff Burton could ruin an incredible album.  As Metallica's most musically complex album, it's not their best album only because the production is just alright.  It may not contain their best song ever written (\\"Master of Puppets\\" was their best), but overall it's still a masterpiece, and \\"One\\" is a close second to their best song ever written.  I will say this though, ...And Justice for All is definitely not a good place to start if you're getting into Metallica.  Its complexity and raw production is better suited for people who know them well.  If you're getting into Metallica, get Ride the Lightning first, but otherwise, pick this up - you won't be disappointed.
0553382152|5.0|I enjoyed the book whether it was true or not. The message is God's unconditional love of humanity. Eadie has refused to release proof of her death through medical records, so one is forced to \\"believe it or not.\\" I guess it's not important whether or not it's true as the message is still a good one.  I visited Eadie's website after reading the book and joined her private group. After a few years w/ the group, I myself, now doubt the validity of the claims in the book. My opinion is that there are much better books available on NDEs- Melvin Morse, Raymond Moody, Dannion Brinkley, PMH Atwater, etc. You can't judge a book by its cover but many a message is judged by its messenger, and in that area I was not only extremely disappointed but also incredibly hurt. Do I recommend the book?  I have to say that I believe there are others out there that are better.<br /><br />Initially, I gave the book 5 stars. However, now, I'd give it maybe 2 or 3 tops.<br />Dawn Moreno/Esoterica
B00008WG3U|2.0|So this is just one of those CDs I bought 'cause I had the money and wanted to hear something different, but maybe I should have held on to those 13 dollars. For what it's worth, this isn't a BAD CD, but it's not a GOOD CD either. There are a few perks here and there, the opening track is an amazing way to begin the CD, and \\"She's Nubs\\" is another fast paced one I really enjoy, but there's one thing that this band seems to lack. No, I wasn't about to say political accuracy, but that's true as well. I was gonna say they lack energy. In the first track they claim to be punk maybe 4 or 5 times, and at the time they sound like it, but as the CD goes on, and on, and well... on, they lose alot of the energy and fast paced music that makes up punk rock. For example, once you get past the first 5 tracks, which are making you think that maybe this might be a pretty good album after all, they hit you with 4 slow songs in a row... 'punk rock' CDs aren't supposed to have 4 slow songs at all. Now I know this is a bit off topic, but take one of my favorite bands, the Suicide Machines, for example. I have three of their CDs right now, and between them all, there's only 1 slow song, which happens to be a hidden track. These guys are, to put it simply, pretty boring. Now I thought this might have been a sellout album, but then I heard \\"Pump up the Valuum\\" or however the heck you spell it at my friend's house and it's not much better, even though that was supposably a great NOFX classic. Well, sorry, but I guess it's not for me. Maybe if Fatty quickened his pace a bit, made more songs like 1 and 5, they'd make the band alot better, 'cause as of now, even the wise-crack lyrics on songs like \\"The Idiots Are Taking Over\\" couldn't save this CD.
B00068NVI4|3.0|Most likely if you are looking at this you are a die hard Yes fan.  You might have attended the 35th anniversar tour at some point as I did.  I actually saw them twice once in San Jose at the Sharks arena and then at the ampitheater in Concord with Dream Theater. Natrually I was looking for something to preserve the memory of seeing this great band. <br />I don't mind the song selection, some thought it was boring I didn't.  The thing that disapoints me about this DVD is the terrible sound quality.  I don't know if it was the sound engineers or the people who mixed the DVD but the low end and the drums hardly come through at all.  Another thing is this DVD's release was delayed several months.  I don't know why the sound is bad and the only interview is with Roger Dean.   <br />This DVD could have easily contained commentary from the band, individual interviews with the band, a little bit of tour documentary, maybe a gear section???  Instead we get to see Roger Dean painting ballons.   <br />My recomendation is to buy this DVD only if you expect nothing but the concert it's self.
B000000OEI|3.0|The soundtrack is very repetitive. Having not seen the film I can't say why. The music is very evocative of the sea, and battle, and is very stirring.   I bought the CD for one particular track, which is very short unfortunately.
0790729350|5.0|I'm a native New Yorker and huge Hendrix fan. The moment the VHS set became available, I purchased one to get the full impact and feeling that was the concert so lauded by NYers as I grew up.  What I expected were great musical performers, but what I got exceeded that.<br /><br />Unity.  One small, encapsulating word so vacant from any concert event today.  As I watched the exceptional performances of Sly and the Family Stone, Janis Joplin, Santana, Crosby, Stills & Nash and of course, Hendrix, I was amazed by what I did not see.  Look around for vestiges of corporate sponsorship and you'll find none. As a concert attendee since my early teens, I cannot recall ever attending an event lacking in sponsorship. I've heard stories from people who attended the event who shared stories of the remarkable spirit of the Bethel residents who brought them food, let some camp out on their lawns and let many use the telephone to let their families know they'd made it to upstate NY.<br /><br />People got together to share the music, but they also shared whatever they brought with them with the people they interacted with.  If you were hungry, you were fed. When thirsty, you were fed.  When it rained, you either found shelter or found a friend to slosh about in the mud until it was all over.<br /><br />The performances are amazing, but it's the spirit of the event that attracts me to watching this DVD yearly on the anniversary of Woodstock '69. I admire the unity and long for it in these selfish, self-involved times.

0670033375|5.0|Collapse sums up the global environmental problem. We, as arguably the most intelligent species on the planet, should know better than to send it into a cascading collapse, but, more often than not we don't. Historically, many civilizations drove their environment so hard that they and collapsed. Some societies, like Japan, nearly destroyed their forests, but recovered their senses, or 'got it' in time. Why?  <br /> <br />Why do some countries exhaust their environment and others learn to live in harmony with them? It is the question of our time because at this juncture our existence our world has shrunk so that in essence all of man and his actions affect the planet as a whole. Break down the environment in one place and it affects another--Nature has no respect for man's artificial borders.  <br /> <br />Collapse, carefully researched (and experienced by the author), is very enlightening on this critical issue.
B00005JMAH|1.0|How can anyone possibly think that this is a decent film!?  The Director (more accurately put, as i stated above 'The Harry Potter Nazi') has completely mangled the plot and any connection this book had to the movie.  Have any of you noticed that Harrys patronus is not a stag, or even an animal at all, but it a great pulsating ball of light?  There is also no mention whatsoever of The Quiddich Cup, which should have been a very important piece in this film, and to top the exclusion of Quiddich off, Oliver Wood doesnt even appear in this film!  Another thing I didn't like was the darkness of the movie, I dont know about you, but i had to turn the brightness up on my TV to be able to see anything at all.  The students also rarely wore robes, instead trading them for street clothes, and when they did wear robes, they looked as though they had been dragged through a hurricane, with all the stains on them, and you cant tell me that Daniell Radcliffe ties a tie really that bad!  They also cut out many scenes that were very important to the film, seeming as though they took some of the scenes out of the hat, arranged them randomly, and added in some of their own.  There were also many unrealistic things in it, worst of all being that if Snape ever caught Harry roaming the corridors at night, he'd give him detention for a week, not just let him walk away with Professor Lupin. <br />I can however think of one work to sum up this movie, 'yuck'. <br />Let us hope that the director does not follow in Alfonso Cuaron's footsteps.
B00005JNZ4|1.0|\\"Must Love Dogs\\" is like the Taco Bell Chihuahua: it's cute at first, but very quickly becomes tiresome. \\"Dogs\\" is a sloppy assemblage of all of romantic comedy's most common and most boring aspects: the large, supportive (preferably Irish Catholic) family; the unsure, slightly neurotic but beautiful divorc&eacute;e; the sensitive, emotional man who is good with his hands but not his feelings; the pert, too-perky dialogue; and yes, even the dreaded family singalong. (There are poetry recitations too, in case you wondered.)<br /><br />A movie like this is almost entirely dependent on how much we like and are engaged by its leads. Unfortunately there isn't much to like about them here; the characters of Jake and Sarah (played by John Cusack and Diane Lane) are such one-dimensional stereotypes that there is little the actors can do to make them engaging. The dialogue feels rehearsed and overdelivered. Jake is so alarmingly upfront and intense in his first date with Sarah that it's impossible to really believe a stressed-out neurotic like her would actually agree to a second date, let alone go home with him. And as for the \\"dogs\\" of the title, they feel as contrived and extraneous as anything else; they don't contribute to the plot, they just provide a catchy title.<br /><br />The plot feels contrived and forced, even for a romantic comedy; the only reason that Sarah and Jake don't immediately get together seems to be that there wouldn't be a movie if they did. There is a series of actions they have to perform first, and they go through all the motions like clockwork: they doubt their own feelings. They doubt each other's feelings. Sarah misplaces her affection and gets burned. There is even a  final climax involving...you guessed it, boats. The usual miscommunications, crossed wires, and mishaps occur, but they don't seem to have any real purpose except to flesh out the movie's running time before the inevitable ending. There isn't much focus on character development: we're shown that Sarah likes kids and teaches kindergarten (which means she must be a decent, lovable woman without faults) and that Jake builds boats by hand and cries when he watches Doctor Zhivago (which means he must be a sensitive, tender-hearted man).<br /><br />And then there is Sarah's family. It is rare even in romantic comedies to have a family simultaneously this obnoxiously annoying and completely unbelievable. Sarah's sister Carol is the typical meddlesome older sister bent on playing matchmaker; she is officious and callous, but only with the best of intentions, so Sarah forgives her. Christopher Plummer as Sarah's father Bill is an aging lothario; Plummer plays it well, but is it very believable for Bill, supposedly married to the \\"love of his life\\" for 45 years before losing her, to immediately become an inconsiderate philanderer who strings several women along at once? I think not. This is the kind of family who invites a practical stranger over for dinner and then has a goofy family singalong in front of him. And they're not even drunk when they do this. And then there are the requisite Gay Buddies, who are so stereotypically \\"Hollywood Gay\\" that it's painful and offensive to watch.<br /><br />There are only two characters in the whole mess who are believable at all: Dermot Mulroney's Bob, a seemingly wonderful guy who smoothly conceals a sleazier side and wins Sarah's heart before breaking it, and Stockard Channing's Dolly, a 50ish hippie with a kind heart, though she is treated badly, and more wisdom than everyone else in this movie combined. Sad, that the only thing this romantic comedy convincingly portrays is the existence of cads and heartbreak.re shown that Sarah likes kids and teaches kindergarten (which means she must be a decent, lovable woman without faults) and that Jake builds boats by hand and cries when he watches Doctor Zhivago (which means he must be a sensitive, tender-hearted man).  <br /> <br />And then there is Sarah's family.

B00082IJ08|5.0|When \\"Gorillaz\\" was released, I considered these guys simply another techno band without a future...and you have no idea how wrong I was. When I began to hear more songs, watch their videos and really get into their addictive groove, I finally understood how very crucial it was for me to have that CD. I ran, bought it, and have been happy ever since. Now heaven smiles upon us. We have been blessed with \\"Demon Days\\" (pardon the pun). It's different, but different is good. To anyone reading this who is insecure about buying this album, I can say without a doubt, that this album will be one of your best investments. <br />Go out and buy it this very instant!
B0000TB01Y|2.0|I've never read Gregory Maguire's cult novel this bombastic musical was based on, but if it's half as pretentious as Stephen Schwartz' unoriginal songs and its over-wrought score, then lucky me. After witnessing the elaborate, multi-million dollar train wreck on stage, I approached the soundtrack with trepidation but swore to realize that they are two separate entities. On CD, Chenowenth sings sweetly enough and her comic timing is precise, but the tone of her affect is parody - it's as if she is winking at us. Idina Menzel, so good in `Rent', here sings so over-the-top and so forcefully that any character nuance loses any iota of emotion and the big number `Defying Gravity' lies flat due to her dissipated power - the 'showstopper' that ends act 1 becomes it's anti-climax. My one sentence review of both the show and it's soundtrack: the cast of TVs `Fame' Meets Cirque De Soleil. My grade C+
B000002TQV|4.0|Today Radiohead stands as a monolith among lesser artists.  Their influence is unquestioned, their accomplishments undisputable.  After their first big hit single \\"Creep\\" in the early 90's, many dismissed them as a Britpop one-hit wonder.  Radiohead proved all the naysayers wrong with this 1995 release, their second record and one of the finest moments of the 90's alternative era.    Later records would find Radiohead awash in sonic experimentation, sometimes drawing more attention for their synthesizer antics than for their gorgeous melodies.  Here, Radiohead clearly puts emphasis on the music rather than on how many drum loops they can incorporate into the songs.  Tunes like \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Street Spirit\\" would be beautiful no matter what they were played on, but here the bombast of guitars sends the emotional component of the songs over the top.  The entire record is steeped in melancholy, not the uplifting kind such as in Beck's Sea Change, but a melancholy of despair, of anguish.  The making of this record nearly culminated in the breakup of Radiohead, and that emotional turmoil is certainly reflected within.  Great records are often hell to make, so goes the saying, and this album is a testament to that.      Elsewhere, there is pure guitar-rock abandon on such anthemic tracks as \\"Just\\", \\"Bones\\", and the title track.  The clarity and focus of Radiohead's musical attack shines through on every single song, and their compositional genius is matched by the stellar musicianship which pulls it all together.      Radiohead would go on to record their masterpiece, OK Computer, two years after this album.  The basis for OK Computer's majesty, however, was rooted in the pop-rock intensity of The Bends.  Both visceral and intellectual (just read some of Thom Yorke's visionary lyrics), The Bends has stood the test of time and remained an essential album from an era where the music was often overshadowed by flannel shirts.  This is an extremely worthwhile recordthat shows where the foundation was laid for Radiohead's later innovations.
B000065PUE|4.0|I'm listening to this group over and over again trying to pick out what it is that makes people like them so much.  From that I can gather, it's ironically not their musical sound but chiefly their lyrics that draw people in.  I say this because seemingly their sound lacks fidelity, feels rushed at times, is immature, and out of tune at times.  I guess that it has this whimsical and surreal quality about it -- kind of the original sound that newer groups like Modest Mouse are now reminiscent (not that Modest Mouse is a clone, they aren't).  I think that people get it, that music is an *expression* and it doesn't always have to cross it's \\"t\\"'s and dot it's \\"i\\"'s to be good. It's no wonder this group has been on the top of many people's all time favorite album lists.  However, if you need great sound in your expression, you may want to look somewhere else for it.  It's truly great musical expression, but I guess I'm more of a rolling stones' brown sugar kind of guy...
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album is better then her first, which is suprising since most artists screw up after their first.  This CD is more mature, and meaningful. Those who don't like Avril, get your head out of the gutter and listen to some real rock music. Not your crappy rap, hip-hop and R&B.  \\"Take Me Away\\" - 5/5 When this song started, I felt shivers run up and down my spine. It really draws you in  \\"Together\\" - 5/5 Awesome song about not loving your boyfriend the way you used to. I'm sure some people can relate.  \\"Don't Tell me\\" - 5/5 I love this song! It isn't like most \\"girl power\\" songs. It tells about a boyfriend who thinks he can be abusive and tell you what to do all the time. Many girls today are in this situation. It tells you to stand up to your boyfriend, because it's your life and no one is going to tell you how to live it.  \\"He Wasn't\\" - 4/5. Catchy. Leaning slightly toward the pop genre  \\"How does it feel?\\" 3.5/5 Nice! A really meaningful, slower song about being different from someone. But I'm sure most people enjoy Avril's faster, rock songs better  \\"My Happy Ending\\" - 4/5. Good. Nothing too special about it. Fun to listen to  \\"Nobody's Home\\" - 10/5. My favorite. A really meaningful song about a girl who can't find her place. Her family doesn't love her like they should, and now she doesn't know what to do. Not your typical \\"teen angst\\" song. It's very powerful.   the rest are also really good, especially \\"Slipped Away\\". I'm just really tired...
B000066NW0|4.0|First off, I know how much controversy there is with Avril Lavigne so I'm saying this: I am reviewing a Cd, not Avril herself, or how the music was written, or whatever. <br /> <br />Now, onto the reviewing: <br /> <br />Losing Grip: 4.5/5- An excellent opener with good lyrics. I've noticed that myself and many others can relate to this song's lyrics and the music is pretty nice as well. <br /> <br />Complicated: 4/5- I admit, it's a good song, but was WAY too overplayed. After a while of listening it gets annoying so I liste to this song sparingly. <br /> <br />Sk8er Boi: 4/5- I always found this song interesting. I like songs that tell stories and this one is a little more direct that others I've heard. It's also one of the more fast paced songs. <br /> <br />I'm With You: 5/5- I normally don't like slow songs, but this one for whatever reason really captures my attension. It is probably my favorite song on the album and has beautiful music and lyrics. <br /> <br />Mobile: 4/5- It's a pretty catchy song I admit. The melody is one of those you can easily hum in your head and the lyrics are decent as well. <br /> <br />Unwanted: 4.5/5- This is probably the harshest song on this album. It basically talks about a person, in spite of being good and nice, is \\"unwanted\\". It definately has a rougher edge to it and it's a nice variation from the other songs. <br /> <br />Tommorrow: 3/5- I find there is often one song on the album that doesn't reach me and this would be the one here. The music is slower and the lyrics are softer that the other songs, but it never grew on me. <br /> <br />Anything but Ordinary: 5/5- At first I didn't like this song, but once I really listened to it, this song steadily became my second favorite song on the album. It has a mix of tunes and the lyrics are different; it makes for a good song. <br /> <br />Things I'll Never Say: 3.5/5- This was another song that didn't appeal to me. The music and lyrics for some reason don't seem to go together well. <br /> <br />My World: 4/5- This song is basically about Avril's life before she brought out this album. It's a good song and the music and lyrics really flow together. <br /> <br />Nobody's Fool: 3.5/5- This was another song that really didn't catch me, though the tune is catchy and the lyrics are pretty good. <br /> <br />Too Much to Ask: 4/5- This song's lyrics seem to refer to a girl who's boyfriend has a too negative look on life and the girl leaves him. The music is decent, but it's not my favorite song. <br /> <br />Naked: 5/5- This is another of my favorites. I always thought the music was great and the lyrics baeutiful. It's a great ending to a good album. <br /> <br />Overall, this album gets four stars from me. If you've heard a few of Avril's songs and liked them, I recommend the album.

B000002LND|5.0|Madonna showed the world that she was truly a legendary pop artist of the 80's. Never content with one style, Madonna made every song she sang different from the one before, making for a immense variety of music. Combined with smart lyrics, lush arrangements, addictive beats, and her ability to shock, and Madonna was one of the big three pop stars of the 80's (along with Michael Jackson and Prince). Her celebrity appeal paralled that of Jackson's, while her ability to push the envelope of shock and the appropriate paralled that of Prince. \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is a solid collection of Madonnas hits from the 80's up to the early 90's.  <br /> <br />Granted, there are quite a few songs missing such as \\"True Blue\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", and \\"Who's That Girl\\". Also, many songs are edited down to their radio-edited formats. Still, this is such a strong collection of music that you won't be bothered by it. I love songs such as \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Like a Virgin\\", the suggestive dance hit \\"Like a Prayer\\", and \\"Vogue\\", to name a few. <br /> <br />As of right now, this is the best collection of hits by Madonna. A new one should be out soon, to include more of her 90's career. But to see what made Madonna the legend that she was, pick up this album. It goes especially great with your Michael Jackson and Prince albums.
B000024611|5.0|This CD is a heck of a collection of \\"Hits\\" indeed. That said, it's true that this disc is missing LOTS of Phil's hits--not just smaller hits/ radio favorites, but big hits like \\"I Missed Again\\", \\"Do You Remember?\\", and \\"Don't Lose My Number\\". Phil's got so many superb hits that they easily could have made this an extraordinary two disc set, and that's not even including his Genesis hits. Still, what we do get here is a heck of a SINGLE disc. (Clever album cover, too.)    Excluding Phil's 1990 \\"Serious Hits...Live!\\" album, this \\"...Hits\\" disc brings together half a dozen songs that weren't on any prior Phil Collins album, and this time all the songs are in their original studio versions. There's the ultra-catchy duet with Philip Bailey \\"Easy Lover\\" which appeared on Bailey's 1984 album \\"Chinese Wall\\". There's the regal, soaring power ballad \\"Against All Odds\\", a smash hit from the soundtrack to the movie of the same name (it's actually based on a song Collins had 'left over' from the \\"Face Value\\" era but hadn't used). There are his two contributions to the soundtrack for the movie \\"Buster\\" which Phil starred in--the intoxicatingly infectious feel-good tune \\"Two Hearts\\", co-written by Lamont Dozier; and his brilliantly reinterpreted version of the Mindbenders' mid-'60s hit \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love\\" (no offense to Eric Stewart).    As has become the custom, Phil added one new song, but it's not a Collins composition--it's a cover of Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colors\\". Babyface produced it and did the drum programming on it, and it ends up having a frighteningly \\"contemporary\\" sound to it a la the Backstreet Boys or N Sync, but thankfully, this production style has proven to very much be a \\"one shot deal\\" for Phil, and basically all of his subsequent music has found him staying true to himself. (Thank goodness Phil hasn't done a full album with Babyface producing.)    Another downside is the Phil Collins-Marilyn Martin duet version of the Stephen Bishop composition \\"Separate Lives\\". I've always found this track to be utterly uncharacteristic of Collins, and it just doesn't suit him. Bishop's own solo acoustic version of it recorded in the '90s was a revealation to me, but the hit version here is frustratingly sappy and I've never been a fan of it.    There are a couple other iffy inclusions too. The cliche-ridden \\"Something Happened On the Way To Heaven\\" isn't one of Phil's best hits, and it should have been left off in favor of one of his superior hits that DIDN'T make the cut. Also, his faithful cover of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" is well done and fun, but it really should have been left off to make room for one or two more Collins-penned songs. I also want to point out, as other have, that the songs are NOT sequenced in chronological order.    Despite all the gripes, the positives of this disc steamroll the negatives.  Very minor trimmings aside, the songs are all full-length and the sound quality on the disc is superb.  And of course, there's simply no arguing with most of the inclusions--\\"Another Day In Paradise\\"; \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\"; \\"Both Sides of the Story\\"; \\"One More Night\\"; \\"Dance Into the Light\\"; \\"In the Air Tonight\\"; \\"Take Me Home\\"--all great songs, and all collected on one disc, along with the aforementioned gems.    Phil's ability to excite and/ or move you with his music is truly incredible.  You really need all of his proper albums from 1981's \\"Face Value\\" through 1993's \\"Both Sides\\"--each of them are masterpieces, and I can't fathom any serious music listener feeling otherwise.  And really, to put it a certain way, \\"Face Value\\", \\"Hello, I Must Be Going!\\", \\"No Jacket Required\\", and \\"...But Seriously\\" are practically \\"greatest hits\\" albums unto themselves, with many of the 'lesser known' songs having received significant radio play or having been big fan/concert favorites.  So, \\"...Hits\\" is certainly high on great songs, but by all means, get the individual albums if you haven't already.
B00000JZI9|5.0|This is such a great film, and I waited way too long to watch it again. Once again, director Lawrence Kasdan assembled a large, talented cast (many from \\"The Big Chill\\") and he creates a world that totally absorbs the viewer. \\"Silverado\\" is an affectionate homage to the good-guys / bad-guys movies of yesteryear, except one's not really sure who's good & bad at the outset. This makes for fine film-making. A very literate script, beautiful cinematography & editing, and fine acting, along with Kasdan's loving direction make this a treat for all, regardless if you're a fan of westerns.  Bruce Broughton's score is memorable, and Kevin Kline & Scott Glenn are the best buddy-team since Butch & Sundance (wonderfully supported by co-buddies, Danny Glover & Costner). I could go on about background info, etc., but if you love an exciting film, good for the whole family (despite some violence), where good wins over evil (despite impossible odds), you should see this film.
B000002IG4|5.0|This second solo album from Phil Collins, \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\", was originally released in late 1982, and although it's not *quite* as great as his two surrounding albums--\\"Face Value\\" & \\"No Jacket Required\\"--it's really splitting hairs, because this is a great album in its own right.     I've seen this album referred to as being, essentially, a carbon copy of the previous album, which is a bit of an overstatement. Certainly, the two albums aren't without similarity, but overall, this album is considerably less quiet than \\"Face Value\\" (which featured a smokey and/or starkly-arranged sound on many of the tracks). Also, although it doesn't seem like it was a conscious move, drum machines are not very prominent on here. \\"Thru These Walls\\" does feature sustained keyboard chords over a rhythm loop, but the loop doesn't have the \\"machine\\"-feel of \\"In the Air Tonight\\"--it sounds more like real percussion. The album is excellently produced (by Collins & assisted by Hugh Padgham)--it sounds very crisp, vibrant, and more organic than the two studio albums from Genesis that it's sandwiched in between.     It starts off with the cathartic break-up song \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", which features explosive drums, unhinged vocals, & a classic Collins build-up. \\"Do You Know, Do You Care?\\" is slower, but very similar, & is also excellent, with an arresting, ominous, doom-laden atmosphere, as well a great, extended high note from Collins toward the end. These 2 tracks display an angry, raging Phil letting off a ton of steam to powerful effect.    Lyrically, Phil continues to express disgust over a broken relationship on \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\" and \\"It Don't Matter To Me\\", but on these tracks he uses an upbeat, horn-laden pop-rock enviroment instead, and each of these tracks are gems.  \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\" seamlessly works its way through several different musical sections, and is in a very similar vein as the 1981 Genesis song \\"No Reply At All\\".    \\"Thru These Walls\\" isan arrestingly creepy song that effectively creates the feeling of being a little kid locked in their room in the dark and being able to hear what their parents are saying/ doing.  The melodic, pleading, piano-based ballad \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\\" is a gem as well. Another track to feature masterful Collins use of dynamics is the splendid sax & horn-laden instrumental-plus-vocal chant \\"The West Side\\" (the bit that arrives at 1:08 of the track totally recalls \\"Harbor Lights\\" by Boz Scaggs). The gentle orchestrated ballad \\"Why Can't It Wait 'Til Morning\\" is a tad tedious, but it's only about 3 minutes long and is a decent album-closer.    Phil lightens up the mood to jolting effect on a couple of tracks, which was probably intentional.  The cover of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" (every other track is a Collins solo composition) is brilliantly done, with subtle differences that, quite frankly, help it easily surpass the Supremes' original; the particular area of improvement comes in doing away with the weirdly out-of-time bass guitar, but on top of that, Phil's lead vocal is excellently-phrased, and his mimicing of the girls' background vocals is a blast.  However, he does get a little carried away on \\"Like China\\", which features annoying lyrics, including Phil saying he'll treat his girlfriend \\"like china\\" knowing it's her \\"first time\\", and the song is made additionally annoying by his jokey vocal, but it still does have that catchy guitar riff plus the soaring bridge sections. It seems as though he was trying to draw some attention away from his angrier side by sticking \\"Do You Know, Do You Care?\\" in between \\"Like China\\" & \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\".     So, the album ends up being a tad flawed, but it's not a big problem at all--the lion's share of the album is brilliant. Track upon track features Collins taking his own personal turmoil and turning it into powerful art--in other words, Collins at his best.
B00002687X|4.0|I owned 'The Final Countdown' for years. I bought the album 'The Miracle' of hard rock/Power metal band 'Prime Time'. It countained an excellent remake of 'Seven Doors Hotel' which is on the first untitled Europe album.<br /><br />Before that, I never looked at the other albums of Europe. I order the two preceeding 'The Final Countdown' and this is the first one I received. In a word, 'Wings of Tomorrow' is FAR greater than what I excpected. I feel like I found an almost-new band. Now it seems to me like Europe is more a heavy/power metal band to me than what I always thought. Listen to 'Scream of Anger' THERE IS DOUBLE BASS DRUMMING. Of course it's not Nicholas Barker  (dimmu borgir). But it's clearly power metal. You have to hear the remake of Arch Enemy, though I much prefer the Europe version.<br /><br />I hear a lot of early Judas Priest (don't think Halford) in here too. Or maybe it's just me. Of course there are bits of what is to be the follow up 'The Final Countdown'.<br /><br />The vocals of Joey is less in the nose as on 'The Final...'. It sounds better I think.<br /><br />I recommend this album to anyone who likes powerful 80s metal. Can't wait to hear the first album. Hope it will arrive soon.

B00007G207|4.0|I agree with all who believe the original theatrical version of Cinema Paradiso has all the warmth, charm, and nostalgia that a feature film can possibly muster. Besides, it was suitable entertainment for mature youngsters, or at least those who have patience with subtitles.    The \\"new version\\" of the film ultimately creates an entirely different vibe by virtue of the added love scenario upon Salvatore's return to the town of his youth.  While not exactly soapish in tone, it certainly left me perplexed as to what to make of him.  Could he be considered a stalker? A homewrecker?  Even a pathetic failure?  Or was he merely a genuinely hopeless romantic?  There's no doubt that such a choice forced on the viewer makes for a more complex viewing experience.      Alfredo's purposeful deceit causing Salvatore's (and Elena's) loss of true love in life also made for added complexity, though one doesn't necessarily think less of the blind elder since the deceit was still carried out in what he felt to be Salvatore's best interest.  What was disappointing, however, was that a real-life choice was denied the young lovers; though one gets the impression that the \\"choice\\" would not have been rendered with practical reason!  It begs the question:  Was Elena Salvatore's true love, or was it the cinema?    This is a fine DVD including both versions; one can hardly complain because of it.  I agree with those reviewers who heartily recommend viewing the original theatrical version first and letting its obvious enchantments seep into your psyche.  When viewing the new version, know that those sentiments may be lessened somewhat; but also know that you'll be viewing a different film entirely...and not necessarily a lesser one.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|I can't say enough about this film.  I grew up watching the Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest films on the USA network every Saturday morning.  I was a seven year old captivated by the stories of the unlikely hero, the oppressed communities, and the reluctant masters.  Practically every classic Kungfu film follows these guide lines, but if you are a true fan, the topics never tire.  You love them because you share in there triumph over evil and their struggle in defending their true love.<br /><br />And then came Kung Fu Hustle.<br /><br />Stephen Chow has taken all of the plots and twisted them lovingly into hilarity.<br /><br />It is a parody in which it is evident that it was made out of love for the genre.<br /><br />The camera shots are crazy and the fight scenes are some of the best ever shot.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the genre, do yourself a favor and buy this.  It will, without a doubt, become a favorite.
B0006399FS|1.0|This has got to be U2's worst ever album.  Apart from \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", I can't name a song which could score more than four out of ten!
B00008AWOG|5.0|This band is amazing.  This album is among their best.  In fact, it's become my favorite the short amount of time that I have had it.  From The Moor to White Cluster and everything in between.  There are no weak spots on this album. <br /> <br />Any Opeth fan should have this album.
B000002GK1|5.0|I don't really have anything to say about this fine album (possibly their best) that hasn't already been said on here.<br /><br />But i will say that this album could do with a remaster or remix. I hadn't listened to it in a few years until a few weeks ago and upon playing it again it struck me just how thin the drums sound. They placed the emphasis on Cornell's voice in the studio and the backbone of the record suffered as a result, it could do with a reworking to place some oomph in the drummming to turn this album into the collosal beast it really is.
0670033693|5.0|I read lots of books, but rarely does a story or characters stay with me the way those from The Cold Dish have.  I finished this book three months ago, but I still find myself reflecting on the story and anxious to know what Walt is up to now.  Craig Johnson sure knows how to weave an exciting tale!  I've never given much thought to travelling \\"out west\\", as we say here in Kentucky, but the picture Craig paints in this novel makes me want to pack a bag and hit the road.  I highly recommend this book and anxiously await the next.
B00000099Y|5.0|Saying this album, Tool's third, is a mind trip is an understatement. \\"Aenima\\" is utterly genius, and is arguably Tool's best album to date. It doesn't matter what genre this is (smart metal, intricate metal, math metal or alt metal), because it is, in my opinion, one of the 50 best and smartest C.D.'s ever released. It's flawless, and if I've ever heard a C.D. which is worthy of a five-star review, this is it.<br /><br />The group's frontman is Maynard James Keenan, but he isn't the only band member who is a musical Einstein. Guitarist Adam Jones is a true star, and he shines brightly, here. Everything (vocals, lyrics, musicianship) is perfect. About every song has of sophisticated, thought provoking lyrics, multi-faceted vocals, complicated music, roaring riffs, brooding drum work, complex song structures, catchy rhythms, odd time signatures and tempo changes, eerie sound effects, dark themes, haunting atmospheres, inhumanly brilliant songwriting, and restrained rage/insanity. Tool are the masters of all of those things and combining them together to make a perfect, innovative disc.<br /><br />Like all of my favorites, this C.D. is an eargasm; but \\"Aenima\\" is also different. For one thing, it's 77 minutes long (granted, there are some long intros and outros, but those are also what Tool have become famous for.) Next, even though it's a great listen from the first time you listen to it, there's more to this album than what initially meets the ear. That's mainly because the lyrics are very smart and deep. For instance, the title of the song \\"Forty Six and 2\\" references Carl Jung's theory (Carl Jung was a psychiatrist) that you can reach a higher revolutionary state, where your body has two more chromosomes than the normal 46. Also, in more than one song, Maynard talks about his \\"shadow.\\" The shadow, in question, represents the side of Maynard's personality that he hates and fears.<br /><br />Now, this disc is not for you if you're religious. Please realize that the members of Tool are scientists, so their music continues to wage war and expand the gap between science and religion. They're atheist/humanists, but since some of Maynard's lyrics do bash Christ, I can see why you would think they're Satanists.<br /><br />Album opener \\"Stinkfist\\" has bouncy guitar noises, then, after some guitar feedback, the riffs become humming, and the drums almost sound tribal at times. Maynard's vocals are, at first, pushed to the back, but the song gains momentum and, pretty soon, Maynard is yelling: \\"I just need it; to see, to feel, to know I'm alive!\\"<br />\\"Eulogy\\" begins with a long intro; it takes about two minutes for the actual song to start up. This song features a lot of different types of guitar work (choppy, punching, beeping, and stop-start riffs), as well as a long, very Maynard-esque yell near the end. But \\"Eulogy\\" is really a highlight because of its lyrics, which are blatantly sacrilegious. Maynard yells things like \\"He (Jesus) had a lot to say; he had a lot of nothing to say,\\" \\"Would you die for me...don't you lie,\\" and \\"Come down...get off the cross, we need the space to nail the next martyr.\\"<br />\\"H\\" has brooding riffs, which become spacey (alongside a spacey drum beat).<br />\\"Forty Six and 2\\" is another momentum gainer; it begins with soft, repetitive guitar noise and hand percussion, but the song erupts and jumps in volume during the chorus. A couple of tempo changes are included here, as well, including one at the end, where the beat becomes bobbing, pounding riffs.<br />Track seven is where Maynard gets mad. Lyrically, it's about meeting a boy who accuses Tool of selling out, and Maynard isn't happy about it. He rages pretty much throughout the whole song, and his vocals ride the beat (which goes up and down) well.<br />\\"Push it\\" has soothing guitar notes which interlock with each other, thus making a long, spacey humming sound.<br />The title track is a personal favorite. Like most tracks on here, it's very dark, and has great musicianship. It begins with (what sounds like) repeated whisperings of \\"Hey, hey, hey,\\" then Adam churns out a riff which will probably be stuck in your mind all day. There are some more (soft-hard, fast-slow-fast) tempo changes, and the drums become increasingly fast. But the song's vocals and lyrics are even better than the music. Maynard's lyrics are relatable; this song is a rare occasion, where they aren't scientific or mathematical. This song's subject matter is about being tired of worrying about the small things in life, and just wanting the whole city (Los Angeles) to be flooded and flushed under.<br />\\"Third Eye\\" is over thirteen minutes long, and I believe it's about drugs (particularly acid), and being high. It begins with a sample of Bill Hicks' comedy routine. Bill explains why he believes drugs HAVE done some good things for our society (because every band is \\"really high off drugs\\"). Then the song adopts some wind whooshes and other sound effects, and a drum beat eventually kicks in. The guitars and vocals finally start up, but the guitar noise sort of blends in with the sound effects, and the vocals are usually spoken or whispered. This song, the album closer, is very creepy, and it would be even more trippy to listen to if you were stoned. It becomes briefly heavy around 9:30, with pounding power chords, and again at 12:45.<br /><br />Even the interludes (tracks 4,6,8,10,12, & 14) are essential listening. Unlike most interludes, these tracks aren't a dumb skit or short instrumental; these tracks are smart and interesting. \\"Die Eier Von Satan,\\" for instance, makes machine noises while a German man (maybe a dictator) makes a speech to a crowd.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Aenima\\" is as smart and innovative as heavy metal gets. It's absolutely essential for all metal collections, and, nine years after its release, its brilliance and shock hasn't worn off. It is truly epic. But, even still, I don't think my above descriptions do this album justice. This is one of those albums that you have to hear to believe. And if you're new to Tool, believe the hype, and do yourself a favor--buy this C.D.!nds like) repeated whisperings of \\"Hey, hey, hey,\\" then Adam churns out a riff which will probably be stuck in your mind all day.

0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas, by David Mitchell, is an entertaining, speculative novel that explores the nature of human history and possible sources of meaning within it.  The novel has a complex structure, consisting of six separate narratives that interrupt and refer to one another: <br /> <br />- In \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,\\" set in the eighteenth century, an idealistic American notary undertakes a voyage to the South Pacific, where he observes nearly universal cruelty and cynicism. <br /> <br />- \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\" follows a young composer and con artist to Belgium, where he encounters a renowned musical genius and becomes his amanuensis.   <br /> <br />- \\"Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery,\\" is a send-up of the thriller genre with a plucky and attractive reporter taking on an evil nuclear energy corporation. <br /> <br />- In \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,\\" an aging rake angers the wrong people and suffers for it, amusingly. <br /> <br />- \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451,\\" set in the future, follows the career of an unexpectedly intelligent clone. <br /> <br />- In \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After,\\" a primitive in the far future encounters an advanced culture.   <br /> <br />The conclusions that Mitchell reaches about human history and meaning are pessimistic.  But man is by nature optimistic, and Mitchell allows one of his characters to say that: <br /> <br />\\"If we believe that humanity may transcend tooth and claw, it we believe divers races & creeds can share this world as peaceably as the orphans share their candlenut tree, if we believe leaders must be just, violence muzzled, and power accountable & the riches of the Earth & its Oceans shared equitably, such a world will come to pass.\\" <br /> <br />This book was fun to read - I read it at the beach, in fact - and it offers memorable characters, some imaginative plotting, and a few wise (even startling) observations.  It was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize in 2004. <br />
0805076476|1.0|I read \\"Fight Club\\" because a friend recommended it to me,it seems she really enjoyed it and thought I would too. But I dislike this book on so many levels.  <br />Chuck Palahniuk has a gimmicky writing style that is  annoying, what with all his selfconcious attempts at being clever. I really couldn't stand any of the characters, a bunch of little boys running around who never figured out how to be men.  <br />And I would think a writer would check his facts before submitting a manuscript, but Palahniuk gets several things very wrong that really interrupted the flow of the story. For example, in chapter 18 he keeps refering to a Cadillac and a Corniche. It's confusing because one would think he was talking about two different cars, because a Corniche is a Rolls Royce model not a Cadillac. I finally figured out he was talking about the same car. And with the soap making operation he talks about the fat they are using to make the soap as being collagen. Well collagen is a protein found in skin, ligaments, tendons, bone and cartilage, not in subcutaneous adipose tissue.  Those kind of mistakes just get in the way of the lame story he is trying to tell.
B00082IJ08|1.0|<br />Awful. <br />Truly awful. <br />Completely, totally, and utterly awful. <br />Awful beyond any shade of terrible. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm being too nice about it? <br /> <br />I wish I could not only have my money back, but be able to sit down and politely request that the producers, performers, label, and anyone else involved in this could possibly recall each and every copy of it and then bury it deep beneath the Earth...Wait, someday a future archelogist would find it and wonder if we were all stupid. Although, looking at the average 4.5 star review, doesn't make me wonder if they're right. <br /> <br />See, the Gorillaz, it was this clever idea. A synthetic rock band. No rock egos. No banner names. Just good music and a clever front, right? Right! Invented a neat little history, and interesting biographies for the members and built up an entire world around it, with what amounted to very good ensemble music at its core, and some really cool promos to go with them that play off the whole thing.  <br /> <br />But, then this atrocity comes along. The cuteness is gone. The rock music is gone, replaced by computer farts. The backstory is gone, in the name releasing singles. The ensemble is broken, replaced by incessant Alburn-whining and the aforementioned beeping nonsense. <br /> <br />I listened to this album once. It was hard, but I made myself do it. I haven't touched it once, since. I still enjoy the previous two Gorillaz albums (the debut and Spacemonkeyz), either one of which would be a FAR SUPERIOR purchase than this.  <br /> <br />
0070511136|2.0|This book came out in 1988 which means it was probably written in 1986-1987. Interesting that about that same time, IBM one of the companies listed here as endorsing The Spin Method had just lost market share to then up and coming Compaq. The other companies mentioned Kodak, AT&T and Citicorp didn't fare much better.    Considering the turnover in sales, I would like to see a followup on the sales people who were involved in this study and at least, a followup with the companies listed as using \\"Spin.\\" I wouldn't be surprised if all have abandoned this theory. If you read the financial pages, you already know how IBM, Kodak and AT&T are doing and how they did 1988 to 2005.    The concept of using questions is not new. The late, great J. Douglas Edwards was teaching this over 50 years ago. Tom Hopkins and Zig Ziglar have been teaching this for the last 30+ years.     This book offers interesting theory but won't work in the real world. I bought a copy  at my local used book store for $2.50 and feel that it was a total and complete waste of money.    Would recommend Back To The Future In Sales by J. Douglas Edwards and Tom Hopkins, Ziglar on Selling by Zig Ziglar and How To Master The Art of Selling Anything along with Low Profile Selling by Tom Hopkins.     I noticed that a lot of telemarketing companies are now using \\"Spin\\" as a method to move away from the usual robotic, canned scripted technique. \\"Spin\\" may be an improvement and useful to those types, but not real professional, sales.

B00005JNJT|5.0|In my opinion, no one can top the Batman movies that Tim Burton directed. However, Tim Burton aside, this was the best Batman movie ever and I can't wait for the next one. First of all, it actually had good actors in it. I think Keaton is the best Batman/Wayne but Bale did very well. Kilmer wasn't that great and Clooney was the worst choice of Batman EVER. Caine was perfect as Alfred (though I will miss Michael Gough) and Gary Oldman (a great actor anyway) reminded me exactly of Gordon from the animated series from the 90's. Also, the addition of Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman was just amazing. Secondly, the storyline was awesome; they went the best way about it. It brought the dark back in the Dark Knight and showed the origins and training with the ninjas. It set up the process of designing the suit and Batcave. And also showed how actually frightening bats can be. Lastly, the bad guys. The scarecrow was a perfect villain to have and a great addition to the Joker (Nicholson), Catwoman (Pfeiffer), and the Penguin (DeVito) and was actually somewhat scary. Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman being the only good actor in Batman & Robin) and Harvey \\"Two-Face\\" Dent are left out of that list because of just how crappy Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were (correction -- are). And the Riddler is left out because Jim Carrey played him too much like the Joker, however Carrey would have been a great Joker he is not a great Riddler. The one thing I didn't like about the movie was the ass-ugly Batmobile and I seem to be the only one who thinks it is ugly, however, it had all the cool gadgets that are complete Batman style. Over all ... f***ing great movie. I recommend for all (whether you are a fan or not). And thank god he didn't just whip out a spray whenever he was in a hang-up.

The second time you see it you pick up new details and have to go back again!  It's a wonderful, fun movie the first time around.  But you will be drawn to watch it again and again!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|For a long time, being a New Yorker, I avoided this show as I avoided all huge, commercially oriented theater. What a mistake. I just watched this movie and it was simply breathtaking and mesmerizing.  In a way, I am glad I do not have the stage version with which to compare.  The passion invoked in this production is like nothing I have seen. Not in \\"A Man or A Woman\\", \\"Stealing Heaven\\", no, this was the most intense representation of the struggle women face between safe love or passionate love. Passionate love, of course, usually never ends happily but it does raise the soul to become its highest form especially in the arts. This lush, magnificent production had this 52 year old successful woman bawling like a baby...twice.  WOW is all I can say.  Gerard Butler was bone deep incredible. Thank you. You made me a believer in this well known musical. I had to rerun \\"Point of No Return\\" to even believe I was watching something of this magnitude of passion.  Brava!

B000024D4R|4.0|When you hear Floyd, people think of Dark Side or the Wall.  I am expanding my floyd collection and I have stumbled onto a gem entitled \\"Animals\\".  I have never heard any of these songs on the radio probably because each of them are very long 10 minutes plus.  There are 5 songs on this CD and all of them are excellent.  If you are a Floyd fan or just getting into their music this album honestly rates up there with dark side and the wall.  The only downside is that there are basically 5 songs on the CD.  Those 5 songs are great though.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|The other reviewers have described the plot so I'll skip that. Having studied ballet and many other types of dance myself since childhood, I can recognize and appreciate outstanding dancing. I would have to say this is my favorite dance movie, not just for the dancing, which is outstanding, but the whole \\"package\\". And you don't have to be a dancer to enjoy this film, since it's so well done and entertaining (unlike \\"The Company\\", a movie about a ballet company that I found tedious to watch, even though I studied ballet many years and it had beautiful dancing). This film has really outstanding dancing from Paul Mercurio and Antonio Vargas, the 2 professional dancers in the film. Just to see Paul Mercurio dance is worth watching the movie for (and what a body!). I can tell that he was trained in classical ballet since no one can move like that who was not. But he also brings a wonderful, smoldering sensuality to the screen in the love story. The love story is very touching, the performance of Tara Morice in the ugly duckling to swan role is outstanding and she dances remarkably well for a non-dancer. And then there is the satire of the competitive ballroom dancing world throughout the movie--it reminds me of the movie Best in Show satirizing the dog show world--and it's just as hilarious. Somehow all these elements--dancing, fairy tale story, satire, got mixed together perfectly to make an outstanding movie. The only part I didn't like was the cartoon-y explanation of Scott's father's career, but as the director explains, they had to do it that way due to the low budget. The finale dance (with Paul Mercurio & Tara Morice) is so exciting and well done it just gives me chills and it's also hilarious because the comedy is interspersed throughout it (happening on the sidelines).<br /><br />The director's commentary on the DVD is pretty crappy and there are few special features but it's still worth getting the DVD to get the outstanding picture, color and sound quality.
0312995423|5.0|I chose this book for its reputation as an interesting suspense thriller.  <br /> <br />The story begins with the description of Susan fletcher, head cryptographer of the NASA. The Translator 2.o is the departments main decrypting machine, and has encountered what seems to be an unbreakable code. What seems impossible to Susan Fletcher, did not so for Eric strathmore, director of the cryptography unit. In order to releive some of the tension building in susans mind, Strathmoe revealed the man responsible for sending this code. Ensei tankado, former CIA cryptographer wanted to gain his revenge on the NASAfor firing him; and that was through digital fortres; an unbreakable algorithm. Both Susan and Strathmore feared that a simple code rendering The infamous Translator powerless would be fatal to the departments existence. However Tankado did leave two pass keys to open the code. Strathmore was one step ahead of him having David Becker, a professor at Georgetown, and ironically the lover of susan fletcher, sent to spain.  <br /> <br /> Becker was unaware of the details of his mission, mereley just to retreive a ring froma  man named Ensei tankado. But strathmore knew that obtaining that ring was a matter of National security. For engraved in that ring was the pass key opening the greatest code ever created. Strathmore was intrigued by the idea of the ability to use the code envied by terrorists groups, hackers... However Becker was not alone in his search for the key for someone was hunting him, a man named Pistuchio  <br />Graves, a trained assasin. Pistuchio was waiting for the right moment to kill im. However at that moment, good fortune was on the side of David for becker was alive and pistuchio was dead. Someone higher than strathmore or susan knew of this mission and saved Davids life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile in the Cryptography unit, Translator is melting down. Susan is dumbfounded, for a code has no reaction attached to it. Only a virus could have caused such damage. As tensions increase in the NASA, so do the strength of the assumptions towards strathmoreprotocal regarding the \\"codes\\" entering translator. Soon Susans assumptions were correct and strathmore had let the virus in, though not for harmful purpouses. <br /> <br /> I beleive that the authors tone was great. Almost luike creating an impending action waiting to occurr. His use of suspension keptme reading and reading
B000001GRZ|5.0|I am new to classical music.  My brother plays the cello and recommended this CD by Fournier.  It is, simply, very good.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Here are all the changes:    A New Hope Visual Changes: (The 1981 rerelease version is the exact same as the 1977 version, plus the title insertion and the dialogue change.)    -In the 1977 version, there was no title \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" but when the film was rereleased in 1981, the title was added.    -The shot of R2-D2 wandering down the canyon alone now has a different background.    -The scene where the Imperial Storm Troopers find R2-D2 and C3PO's escape pod has now been extended, and the dewbacks are now CGI.     - The binary sunset was given a strange blur in the 1977/1997 versions, this has been corrected by the 2004 version.    -The Sandcrawler shots have alternate angles, and look much more detailed.     -Obi Wan's home has an alternate view.    -The view of Mos Eisley has been revamped, and looks much more detailed.     -The Landspeeder shot entering Mos Eisley is much more detailed    -The first Mos Eisley scene has been extended, with CGI monsters walking around. This scene looks much livelier. Now Mos Eisley is now a bustling spaceport.     -In the 1977 version, one of the characters in the Cantina Bar orginally looked like a wolf, in the 1997/2004 versions, he now looks like a lizard.     -The most controversial change is the Greedo scene (did you know that one deleted in the Phantom Menace was a scene with Anakin fighting a YOUNG Greedo??)Anyway, this scene had GREEDO shoot first. Unfortunately, the die-hard purists dreaded this change. I don't like it either. In the 1977 version, Han Solo just blasted Greedo. In the 1997/2004 versions, Greedo shot and missed Han Solo and then he blasted Greedo, but in the 2004 version, they shoot almost at te same time, and in the 1997 version they clearly did NOT shoot at the same time.    -The entirely new scene that wasn't in the 1977 version was the Jabba scene, who is entirely CGI, but the CGI is different in the 2004 version.     -The doors on the Death Star open/close slower in the 1997/2004 versions.-The Millenium Falcon departure from Tatooine is different.    -A different Alderaan explosion.    -The scene where the Millenium Falcon gets pulled into the death star has a new effect shot after Obi-Wan says, \\"It's an Imperial Fighter.     -Luke's lightsaber now has color during his training aboard the Millenium Falcon.    -The blaster bolts have been censored to not show the impact in the 1997/2004 versions.     -The perspective background of the cell block corridor has now been corrected.     - The eye of the Dianogah now blinks (2004 version change only)    - The writing on the tractor beam controls is now Aurabesh instead of English. (2004 version change)     - The scene where Han Solo chases the Imperial Storm Troopers away and then he runs into hundreds of them instead of just a few for the 1997/2004 versions.    -During the Obi-Wan/Darth Vader fight, the lightsabers have been corrected in all shots. (In some shots in the 1977/1997 versions, it looks like two people fighting with sticks.)(2004 version change)    -After Obi-Wan is gone, Darth Vader's lightsaber color has been corrected. (2004 version change)    -The shot of the Millenium Falcon flying under Yavin has been changed. In the 1977 version, the Millenium Falcon files directly under Yavin, and in the 1997/2004 versions, it files more to the right of Yavin and with more movement.    -When the Millenium Falcon lands on Yavin 4, we now see the Millenium Falcon land as opposed to the 1977 version where we saw nothing.     -In a new scene, Luke meets up with his pal Biggs.     -The launch has been changed, instead of lights going up into the sky, we now see the X-Wings clearly flying away, and Yavin is less visible, as opposed to the 1977 version where Yavin was clearly visible.    -The approach to the Death Star has been radically changed, with more X-wings/Y-wings approaching, and the ships look much more detailed.    -During the battle of Yavin, The second shot after the leader says \\"I'm going to tryand cut across and try and draw their fire\\" has a alternate view of the now CGI X-wings.    -The battle of Yavin has been given a computer-enhanced makeover and alternate shots. The first is right after Biggs says to Luke \\"he's on me tight, I can't shake him\\" that is an alternate shot, and the second is a reverse angle of Wedge Antilles destroying a tie fighter and going through the explosion.    -The Death Star expolsion is much bigger.    A New Hope sound/dialogue changes:    -When the Sandcrawler stops, there is new dialogue said by C3PO:    1977/1997 versions: (to R2-D2) Wake up. Wake up!  2004 version: We're stopped. (to R2-D2) Wake up. Wake up!    -When Obi-Wan Kenobi scares off the Tusken Raiders, his scream is different. In the 1977/1997 versions, this call sounded suspciously like a dewback scream. In the 2004 version, this sounded like a krayt dragon.    -While the StormTroopers are searching the Millenium Falcon, a line of dialogue is added which is \\"There's no one here.\\"    -After a Imperial Officer says \\"TK-421, why aren't you at your post?\\" there is a new effect when Luke taps his helmet to signal the officer. But this effect is EXTREMELY HARD to make out.     -When the Stormtroopers go into the room where R2-D2 and C3PO are hiding, and one of the stormtroopers hits his head on the door, and the 2004 version added a little \\"oomph\\" to the effect.     -The sound of Princess Leia's blaster sound like a real blaster in the 1977/2004 versions, but sounded like a .44 Magnum in the 1997 version.    -While running from the Storm Troopers, all dialogue said by Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker sounded like an unconvicing echo in the 1977/1997 version, but sounds like a more convincing echo in the 2004 version.    -When Han and Chewbacca escape through the blast doors, The 1977 version did not have a line of dialogue that the 1997/2004 versions did. And it is: \\"Close the Blast Doors!\\"    - The music on the start in the Battle of Yavin is inaudible in the 2004 version, but clearly audible in the 1977/1997 versions.    -The line \\"He's on your tail!\\" was inserted for the 1997 version but removed again for the 2004 version.    -During the battle of Yavin, when a TIE fighter is on Luke, different dialogue is said:    1977/1997/2004 versions: Blast it, Biggs, where are you?  1981 rerelease version: Blast it, Wedge, where are you?    The Empire Strikes Back Visual Changes:    In the 1980 version, when Luke and his tauntaun are captured by the wampa, you never really see the wampa, only hear it. In the 1997/2004 versions, the wampa was given a complete makeover, and new shots of the wampa eating the tauntaun were added. And another shot of the right-armless wampa was inserted.     -During the Hoth battle, a black line on the edge of Luke's Speeder Window has been removed for the 1997/2004 versions.    -When Darth Vader communicates with the Emperor, the 1980/1997 versions, the Emperor was voiced by Clive Revill, and the 2004 version was voiced/played by Ian McDarmid. The 1997 version of the emperor has minor changes- the Emperor's eyes have been replaced by chimpanzee eyes!    -Boba Fett's Pursuit is different in all three versions: In the 1980 version, the Slave I was chasing the Millenium Falcon form a more far away angle. In the 1997 version, there is another shot added and the angle has been reversed. In the 2004 version, the same angle as the 1980 version is used and the added shot for the 1997 version has been reversed.     -The 1997/2004 versions give a lot better view of Cloud City by adding CGI shots of the Millenium Falcon flying through the city.    -The shot of Cloud City from a distance is different: In the 1980 version, there is a cloud car and no tibanna gas refinery. In the 1997/2004 versions, there is no cloud car and there is a tibanna gas refinery.     -In the 1980 version, there is only one shot of exterior Cloud City before we see Princess Leia and Han Solo talking about Lando Calrssian. In the 1997/2004 versions, there are several more shots of exterior Cloud City.    -When Lando Calrissian escorts Han, Leia and Chewie, in the 1997/2004 versions, there are now windows that you can now see exterior Cloud City through. Another shot of windows was added also.     -Just when Han is about to be frozen into carbonite, in the 1980/1997 versions, it looks like Han is wearing a sleeveless jacket, in the 2004 version this has been corrected.     -In the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader lightsaber battle, Darth Vader's lightsaber is red in all shots in the 1980/1997 versions, and in the 2004 version, Darth Vader's lightsaber is red in some shots and pink in others.     -The 1997/2004 versions added more shots of Lando telling people to get out of the city.    -The 1997 version added a new scene in which Darth Vader, after failing to seduce Luke into the Dark Side of the Force, was walking back to the shuttle.    -The 1997/2004 versions have a hatch to when Lando rescues Luke, who is hanging from a metal antenna above the skies- as opposed to the 1980 version where there was no hatch and a white glare.    -The scene when Admrial Piett delivers a report to Darth Vader on the bridge of Darth Vader's ship has corrected the placement of the Imperial Insignias for the 2004 version.    -There is a new scene for the 1997/2004 versions of Darth Vader's shuttle flying to the Imperial Super Star Destroyer. Two of these shots are outtakes from Return of the Jedi, because the man who walks with Darth Vader is NOT Admiral Piett, it's Moff Jejerrod, commander of the second Death Star!!    The Empire Strikes Back sound/dialogue changes:    When Luke is brought back to the hidden Rebel base, new dialogue is said:    1980 version: C3PO: \\"Master Luke, it's so good to see you fully functional again!\\"    1997/2004 versions: C3PO: \\"Master Luke, it's so good to see you fully functional again! Luke: \\"Thanks, Threepio.\\"    In the Hoth battle, there is an extra line of dialogue for the 1997/2004 version. In the1980 version, Luke's mouth can be seen moving, but no words are said.     1980 version: Luke: \\"Stay tight and low!\\" Wedge: \\"AAAHHH!!\\"  1997/2004 versions: Luke: \\"Stay tight and low! This is it! Wedge: \\"AAAHHH!!\\"    -Right before the 4 TIE fighters have been destroyed, C3PO says and extra line of dialogue:     1980 version: \\"Oh, this is suicide!\\"  1997/2004 versions: \\"Oh, this is suicide! There's nowhere to go.\\"    -When Darth Vader and the Emperor were communicating via hologram, Ian McDiarmid re-recorded all of the Emperor's dialogue and some lines were altered for the 2004 version.    -In the 1980/1997 versions, Boba Fett's dialogue was voiced by Jason Wingreen, but for the 2004 version, all of Boba Fett's dialogue has been rerecorded (but not altered) and voiced by Temuera Morrison (who plays Jango Fett in Attack of the Clones)    -Right after R2-D2 gets spit out by the river monster in Dagobah, one of Luke's lines has been completely altered:    1980 version: \\"Are you all right?\\" Come on. (helps R2-D2 up) Uhhh. You were lucky to get out of there.\\"    1997/2004 versions: \\"Are you all right? Come on. (helps R2-D2 up) Uhhh. You were lucky you didn't taste so good.\\"    This is by far the best change for the 2004 version: In the 1997 version, when Luke fell, a scream was added and this sounded exactly like the one when the Emperor got thrown down the shaft by Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. In the 1980/2004 versions, THERE IS NO SCREAM!!!!!    When Darth Vader goes to his shuttle, his dialogue has been changed:    1980 version: \\"Bring my shuttle.\\"  1997/2004 versions: \\"Alert my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival.\\"    Return of the Jedi visual changes:    This is the worst change for Return of the Jedi: In the 1983 version, the Max Rebo band (Max Rebo is the blue elephantine thing) pipe player Droopy McCool and singer Sy Snootles are playing the song \\"Lapti Nek\\". In the 1997 version, this scene is almost entirely diiferent: Sy Snootles is now completely CGI,and she has been given a CGI companion named Joh Yowza. Together, they sing \\"Jedi Rocks\\" which is so bad it seems out of place. The 2004 version is the same as the 1997 version, but also Han Solo' carbonite encased form is not on the wall.    -The sail barge's movements and shadow were almost unnatural in the 1983 version, this has been corrected for the 1997/2004 versions.    -The Rancor sequence had that black line on the Rancor in the 1983 version- as you saw on the window of Luke's speeder in the 1980 version of the Empire Strikes Back. That has been removed for the 1997/2004 versions.    -The Sarlacc has been greatly changed: In the 1983 version, the Sarlacc is a \\"Sarlacc Pit\\" that looked pretty boring with only 2-3 tentancles. In the 1997/2004 versions, the Sarlacc is now a Sarlacc Beast, and has 5-6 tentacles with a CGI birdlike beak.    -In the 1983 version, during the Sarlacc sequence, when Han Solo was hanging from one of the smaller barges, he was hanging by just his toes, with Chewbacca holding him. In the 1997/2004 versions, Han is hanging by his toes with a rope around them and Chewbacca holding him.     -The speeder bike chase has added shots from the back for the 1997/2004 versions.    -In the first part of the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader lightsaber fight, Darth Vader's lightsaber is red in the 1983/1997 versions, in the 2004 version it is pink. Luke's lightsaber is also washed out in the 2004 version, incredibly, the version in which the lightsabers look best is the 1983 version, because the 1997 version of the lightsabers are too bright and the 2004 versions are too dull.    -When Luke unmaskes Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker, he has eyebrows in the 1983/1997 versions, and in the 2004 version, he does not have eyebrows and his eyes were colored to match Hayden Christensen's eyes.    -The destruction of the Death Star II is larger in the 1997/2004 versions.    -The 1983 version of the celebration scene had a panoramic view of the Ewok village on Endor.And the Ewoks play their \\"Yub Nub\\" song. For the 1997/2004 versions, a lot of digital Ewoks have been added, and the song has been changed.    -The 1997/2004 versions have more scenes of the Ewoks and the Rebels celebrating.    This is the worst change in the entire trilogy. The Anakin, Yoda and Obi-Wan spirit shots were all the same in the 1983/1997 versions. In the 2004 version, Sebastian Shaw has been replaced with HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN!!!! I was so shocked to see this change, I nearly had a heart attack.     -A new scene with Oola, a green dancer, has been added for the 1997/2004 versions.    -A shot of Banthas has been added right before the Jabba's barge shot for the 1997/2004 versions.    -Before the Ewok celebrations, a number of celebrations have now been added, with one of Cloud City, then Tatooine, then Naboo(2004 version only), then Coruscant. But there is a change between the Couruscant shots of the 1997/2004 versions. In the 1997 version, the Jedi Temple is standing, and in the 2004 version, there is no Jedi Temple. And there is another difference. This one is tough, to see, but the Senate Buliding has been added for the 2004 version.    Return of the Jedi Audio Changes:    -During the Sarlacc sequence, there is different dialogue before Han shoots one of the Tentacles of the Sarlacc:    1983 version: Han Solo: Don't move, Lando!  Lando Calrissian: Oh, wait, I thought you were blind!  Han Solo: It's all right. Trust me!  Lando Calrissian: A little higher! Just a little higher!    1997/2004 versions: Han Solo: Don't move, Lando!  Lando Calrissian: Oh, wait! I thought you were blind!  Han Solo: It's all right, I can see a lot better.  Lando Calrissian: A little higher! Just a little higher!    DVD Ratings: Video 10/10 There is no argument that this is the best all three films have EVER looked of all three versions.   Audio 10/10 And there is no argument this is the best these films have ever sounded of all three versions.  Extras 9/10 Lots of extras, inculding the 2 1/2 hour documentary \\"The Empire of Dreams: The Star Wars Story\\"     Film Ratings: Star Wars 10/10  1977 orginial theatrical version (without title \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" 10/10  1981 rerelease version (with added title \\"Episode IV: A New Hope) 10/10  1997 Special Edition 10/10  2004 DVD version 10/10    The Empire Strikes Back 10/10  1980 Theatrical Version 10/10  1997 Special Edition 10/10  2004 DVD version 10/10    Return of the Jedi 9/10  1983 Theatrical Version: 9/10  1997 Special Edition 9/10  2004 DVD Version 9/10    Conclusion: Highly recommended box set, and these are the only versions of the classic films that will ever be available. And I'm serious, the orginial versions will NEVER be available on DVD (I'm bummed about that), as they said on the preview before the movie presentation on the 1995 VHS: \\"Get it again- for the last time.\\"
B000002B7U|4.0|Okay, so its 1986, peak of the 80s and of course it seems as if everyone is going hair metal, so figures Ozzy decides to take a trip to the hair metal world as well.  Well this album was defnitely a step down from 1983's \\"Bark At The Moon\\", but it still provides a few great songs, and possibly two of Ozzy's best songs ever.  Jake E Lee's great guitar work is still there but the songwriting is definitely lacking on some parts. <br /> <br />1. Ultimate Sin - B <br />Just average, I don't quite know how to describe it.  Its not bad but theres nothing really that stands out on this song. <br /> <br />2. Secret Loser - A <br />Now this is a great song, defnitely more than just a hair metal song, starting off with a good riff, great verse chords and structure and of course a good chorus.  Jake's intro octave chords to the solo is awesome as well. <br /> <br />3. Never Know Why - B- <br />Okay heres where the hair metal kicks in with \\"We rock!\\" stuff.  This one is more of a generic song but features a cool outro solo. <br /> <br />4. Thank God For The Bomb - B+ <br />The first of two somewhat war themed Ozzy songs on this album, and this is definitely decent.  Although the mood definitely changes from the main riff being really upbeat to some kinda odd mood on the verse and chorus.  Excellent bridge and solo however. <br /> <br />5. Never - B <br />Awesome intro riff and starts to kinda remind of some older Ozzy with this song, but it just fails to provide any catchy magic with this one. <br /> <br />6. Lightning Strikes - D+ <br />Okay now this song just sucks, sheer Kiss-style Poison hair metal.  Plain no good, especially that terrible chorus, but the intro riff is defnitely not a Crazy Train ripoff.  It shares like 3 notes, doesnt make it a ripoff. <br /> <br />7. Killer Of Giants - A <br />Now this song is amazing.  A well written and truly crafted short epic with a very strong lyrical theme.  Such as the first line \\"If none of us believe in war, then can you tell me what the weapon's for?\\" , or another \\"If the button is pushed there will be nowhere to run\\".  Definitely Ozzy's best lyrics and an awesome guitar solo from Jake E Lee. <br /> <br />8. Fool Like You - B+ <br />A better song, very moody and helps to provide a strong final 3 songs to the album with a catchy intro and a slightly generic but good song. <br /> <br />9. Shot In The Dark - A+ <br />Now this is definitely one of Ozzy's best songs ever, Ozzy finally truly sings and it really shines with a very atmospheric performance and one of the best mellow songs ever in my opinion.  Very very well written song. <br /> <br />I'd say that if you like Shot in The Dark, you will probably like this album, so check out Shot In The Dark.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|They sure don't make movies like these anymore. It's one of the best I've seen and the best Drew Barrymore is in. This movie is wholesome as well as it's entertaining. I just wish I could see more like this.
B00012QM9K|3.0|As someone who has studied the Holocaust for 12 years, and as someone who cried when this film was over, I must say that this film is quite inaccurate. All you have to do is read the book \\"Schindler's Legacy\\". Yes, Schindler was a good man for doing what he did. But, truth is, the list was taken over by members of the Jewish police and kapos (work group leaders), and, generally, only the people with the right connections or, more importantly, the right amount of money, got them and their families on the list! Don't get me wrong, this film has great cinematography and very very good acting, but it kind of irks me that the story was kind of altered to make it into a dramatic picture. The Holocaust was dramatic enough as it was, and stories dont need to be altered to this degree. And I understand it is based on the Jews, but is there mention of the other 12-13 million people who died under the Nazi regime? If there is, I am sorry, but I havent seen it. Yes, Schindler did good things, he had a factory that sheltered lives of Jews. But he really had very little to do with the list.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|At first, I couldn't STAND this movie! I mean what was the big deal with this thing?? I saw it and I thought it was ridiculous and I was all too excited when the film ended. BUT. For some ODD reason, this thing has grown on me and I've learned to like it. The reason why, because it's different! And it's reality! I loved the unique characters and I look forward into getting my hands on to this movie. :)
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is an absolute must have for every led zeppelin fan. This is the most complete (official)live led zeppelin release that you can get your hands on. For those who never saw the band live this is as close as you can get. What we have here is two discs of music performed over led zeppelins career. The first disc is an entire early zep performance of music from the first two albums and some cover stuff. The stand outs here are the lengthy Dazed and Confused and the incredible Drum solo Moby Dick that is made better here by the viewing experience since you get to see exactly how amazing it is in it's complexity and John Bonham's speed and command over the kit. The second disc is made of of segments of zep performances covering the 70's put together as one amazing show featuring just about all the classics. Some stand outs here are the beautiful and fun acoustic set, stairway to heaven in it's amazing live glory, and The Ocean. Also there are many hard hitting performances of lengthy numbers such as In the Evening and Achilles Last Stand.  <br /> <br />So, I'll end as I started this is a must have and that it will show you a whole new dimension of zeppelin if you never saw them live. It makes you like Led Zeppelin all the better.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|I love the book and I have many memories with it. But the movie was a little...odd. The hot chocolate milk music (or what sounded like music) was really strange and I still can't figure out why they put it in there. I love Tom Hanks and I thought he did pretty good for playing numerous characters.  The book to me will always have a special place but I can't say enough about the movie though. <shivers>
0805076476|5.0|The book Fight Club in many aspects is alot like the movie. The only thing that i found it to elaborate much more on was the subject of project mayhem. While watching the movie one may find trouble understanding what project mayhem may have been about, but upon reading the book one will have a more clear sense of what it is. The book is written with the main character being the narrorator. Throughout the book he has trouble letting go of what is his life is like, and freeing hiself from the struggles of a middle class society.  The narrorator contains an alter ego which shows up in the form as a different person named Tyler Durden, who represents who he wishes he was like. This character is there to help him achieve the identity he wants.  Throughout the novel tyler and the narrorator develop a secret club, which later turns into a colt, although this club is named fight club theres more to it. It acts as a refuge for other struggling middle class people, where they can also let go and free their minds.  throughout the novel the narrorator and Tyler struggle from their opposite points of view, which later leads to the readers discovery of a twist, about who tyler and the narrorator really are. Another character that plays a key role to this twist is Marla Singer, clues are seen throught parts with her and the narrorator, and parts with her and Tyler.
0767817729|5.0|I saw this movie a few years back for the first time. I missed it when it came out in theaters....I participated in Operation Desert Shield/Storm and perhaps missed many things. I was amazed at how great this movie was, from beginning to end. I wanted to buy the soundtrack but couldn't find it so I bought the movie. <br />The final few minutes were flawless. Perfect harmony with song and mood. Costner and Stowe were very convincing.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|The record companies need to understand that there are those of us out there who are willing to pay for music--we just don't want them telling us what we can and cannot do with it after we buy it. By making it a hassle for me to make compilation mixes, ripping songs to mp3 player etc. the Foo Fighters just lost a loyal PAYING Fan.
0195102681|4.0|This book is an encyclopedic treatment of microeconomic theory.  It covers all the major topics and some even in painful detail.  However, it is the best book out there.  MWG did not intend this book to be for novice readers, as it is clear that some things could have been presented easier with less mathematics but was not.  In any case, this is the standard graduate micro text and it should be.  Varian' book fails in comparison and Nicholson's is quite tame.
B0009IW88A|1.0|You've got to be kidding me! Where is Batman hiding in all this noise? <br /> <br />I've heard the full soundtrack in one sitting and it did absolutely nothing to me. There are two things I generally don't like about Hans Zimmer: first of all, grab your synths and shove them into the lower part of your body, Mr. Zimmer! Before you do that, pull your head out of the aforementioned part of your body and you'll probably realise that orchestral samples aren't at all appropriate for such a film. Newton Howard's cues are a relief after minutes of repetitive drum smashes, incredible amounts of unindentifiable noise, electronic strings (*shudder*), synthesized low brass and boring orchestrations.  <br />Secondly, the rehashing of old stuff (what is it, Hans, distantly related to James Horner?)  <br />The Thin Red Line, Pirates of the Caribbean and so forth, all are intermingled with the new, so called Batman \\"theme\\". Where the heck is that one hiding? Everyone talks about that awesome new theme, but I can't hear it.  <br />Granted, there's that heroic chord and that same drum rhythm over and OVER, but that hardly qualifies as a theme, doesn't it?  <br />Zimmer is worse than James Horner; at least Horner uses real musicians (largely)!  <br />The track titles already suggest what you'll get with this CD: a bloody mess.  <br /> <br />Umm, a bit of a rant, now that I think of it, sorry. It's just that Batman and Batman Returns are two of my all- time favourites and I can't believe how Zimmer tramples on this legacy.  <br />I believe Zimmer when he says that an Elfman- esque approach would have been slightly inappropriate, but why does he abandon the SOUND of the old films?  <br />By the way, I don't think Hans Zimmer cared much about this film. On one hand, he says that he never listened to the old Batman scores, on the other hand he states that his music is identifiable Batman. How can he know what Batman sounds like when he never ever listened to it? <br />Change the style ofthe music, do it, after all it's a different kind of Bat- film, but why oh why can't you keep the power of a real orchestra? It belongs to Batman, no matter how emotional these films become.  <br />Danny Elfman nailed it 15 years ago, so there's no point in reinventing the wheel. <br /> <br />Speaking of emotions, let's get to the so called \\"collaboration\\" between Hans Zimmer and J. N. Howard. It's plainly obvious that Howard did the emotion and Zimmer took on the task of scoring the action and filling darker passages with INCREDIBLY ANNOYING sound effects (come on, a wing- flapping sound effect, how cheesy can you get?) and that's largely it.  <br />I could do such a soundtrack myself, by slapping together a Best Of Zimmer and Howard CD. That's not exactly what I think of when I hear \\"collaboration\\". Let Zimmer overwork some of Howard's cues and vice versa, layer sounds, make it *interesting*, not  la \\"Zimmer fades out, Howard fades in\\".  <br />Write a Batman theme, and may it be only for the main titles; let Howard start it softly, then Zimmer takes over with the main theme, then Howard picks up again with a soaring string interlude ... god, did you come up with *some* interesting thoughts during your, what, three months?  <br />Hm, I forgot, you did write a strong theme, but you dumped it completely because it was not appropriate ... do you know that there's a thing called \\"End Credits\\"?  <br /> <br />The soundtrack was over, and I didn't even notice. Bad sign, huh? No proper Batman theme (nice love theme though), no development and no variation from the Zimmer- front, repetitive Media Venture loops, repetitive noise (it's annoying, did I mention that?), some things borrowed from previous scores and not even a real orchestra that could have given Zimmer's music at least some class and power.  <br />Let me quote Hans Zimmer: \\"There's not a single straight note in this one\\". Wow! Is he proud of that or what?  <br /> <br />What's left? J. N. Howard did a nice job,but nothing that he didn't do before.  <br /> <br />I might be a little conservative, but I still think they missed a fantastic chance by snubbing Danny Elfman. His earlier Batman scores would not work, I guess, but he matured, he changed his style and I firmly believe that he would have updated Batman music the way it should have been done.  <br />He created the signature Batman sound, it would have only been fair to let him update his own soundscapes and come full circle.  <br /> <br />But he didn't, so we get this ... mess.  <br /> <br />Pity.  <br /> <br />Nice cover, though ...
0446677450|1.0|I saw this guy promoting his book on TV and his so called infommercial \\"course\\" on financial management, and after a few minutes I was irate over the false claims that he makes.  Assuming he were truly rich, it's most likely that he was just lucky.  Much like lottery winners, it doesn't give you the credibility to write a book or promote your investment strategy (i.e. buy lottery tickets every week).  Thus, to me, he has no credibility to write a book, hold seminars, or offer investment advice. <br /> <br />I have several problems with his presentation.  First, he questions why our students are not taught financial management in school, and goes on to show a \\"Balance Sheet\\" that only has \\"Assets and Liabilities\\".  Now, in order for something to be called a Balance Sheet, it must follow a fundamental equation of Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity and, more importantly, it should balance.  In any case, just a minor assessement of his techniques would show that his so-called \\"balance sheet\\" will never balance.  For example, he considers a house as a liability because by his definition (which does not follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and will not be found in any accounting textbook) is something that causes you to spend money even when you are not doing anything.  He says that a house, even if you have fully paid for it (i.e. no mortgage), would result in expenses and that means that it is a liability.  So, by his definition, you are a liability to yourself.  That means if you do not do anything, since you have to eat in order to survive and, hence, you have to incur expenses, you are a liability to yourself.  Does that make any logical sense?  Therefore, he advocates to promote financial literacy but he himself does not know what he is talking about.  To exacerbate the situation, he wants to promote the wrong type of literacy.  Kiyosaki wants people to learn the \\"language of the rich\\" or how to learn to read financial statements.  If you teach others to do the wrong thing, how can they read financial statements properly.  A house is an asset, and it is the mortgage that is the liability.  The downpayment that you made is your equity.  It's that simple, and then that guarantees that you would have a \\"BALANCE\\" sheet.  He says that his accountants share the same idea with him.  If he has an accountant that does not know what the fundamental equation of accounting is, I have no idea what kind of accounting he is practicing. <br /> <br />He further goes on to say that the some rich do not even have jobs, whereas the middle-class and the poor all have jobs but lose their money because they do not know how to manage it \\"properly\\".  This is absurd!  Unless you are a Walton and inherit billions of dollars (but they all have some sort of job too), you will most likely have a job.  I doubt that most of the people on the Forbes list are unemployed and just live off whatever they have.  Most of them worked for their wealth, and that is because they knew how to create value.  Financial management only gets you so far, because you first need to be able to create some wealth before you can manage it.  If you do not have wealth, there is nothing for you to manage (unless you are a money manager and that is your job). <br /> <br />Furthermore, he claims that a banker does not look at your grades but your \\"financial\\" report card.  OK, let's give him credit for that but that is general knowledge.  However, he goes on and claims that if you know how to deal you can get up to 90% of the value of your property.  This guy obviously is selling a book, because this is totally misleading his audience.  Only the best of credits would most likely be able to borrow at that high a level.  Usually, you would be able to borrow around 70%.  So, he is giving advice that is almost surely unattainable by his audience.  I could tell you that you will be rich if you won the $100 million lotto.  Whether that is attainable is something else.  Hence, Kiyosaki is describing something that is done by the rich, so you have to be rich first before you can follow his advice.  If you are already rich, then why would you need his advice? That is, you probably did fine on your own.  So, this book sells \\"false hope\\" to say the least.  So, given his definition of assets and liabilities, when the banker asks you \\"how much is your assets and liabilities?\\" you will tell them \\"I have no assets and ALL liabilities.  So, will you give me money?\\" <br /> <br />Don't waste your time on his book nor his infommercial.  More importantly, don't waste time and money on his \\"seminars\\".  You may show up at an empty seminar location with the sign saying \\"This is your first lesson in financial management: NEVER TRUST ANYONE!\\".
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I've never really heard of Stephen Chow before this...I remember he did a couple good Jackie Chan movies, one about the drunken master, but other than that I haven't really seen his work but after seeing this movie, I think I should look into it.  There were some pretty funny parts in it like that weird lookin dance routine in the beginning and the Landlady slappin everyone around for no real apparent reason.  It was good, I enjoyed the comedy and the action, though I think there was slightly more action than comedy, it was still a fun movie to see...
B000001FKY|4.0|This was the first album Def Leppard put out after their drummer had his tragic motorcycle accident losing in arm in the process.  Four long years passed between the release of this album and the release of their previous album \\"Pyromania\\".  When this album finally came out, I was very excited because \\"Pyromania\\" was such a great listen, yet at the same time I was nervous that the band might of lost its touch after 4 years.  Here is my review on Def Leppard's best selling album to date.    Woman- First track off of \\"Hysteria\\" Right away this track has a good metal feel to it.  Slow tempo throughout the song but it certainly isn't a ballad.  After hearing this song I just hoped the rest of the tracks were like this.   Great opening track with a lot of attitude.     Rocket- Here's a track we all know.  Pretty good song just sounds very commercial meaning the first time you hear this song you just know their going to put it on the radio. Just because It's commercial doesn't make it a bad song, but it does get tired after many listens.  Like \\"Iron Man\\" by Black Sabbath, A good song can be over played on the radio. Good song to open concerts with.    Animal-  This is a fun song to sing along to.  Has a very catchy chorus and the verses are good as well.  Certainly not edgy compared to Def Leppard's other songs. This is the kind of song that just makes you smile and dance like an idiot.     Love Bites-  One of my favorite love ballads to listen to period.  It just feels so original.  It's about how he's in love with this girl but he's afraid of losing her so every time they make love it hurts him so much inside.   He feels he is just not good enough for her.  Fantastic lyrics, especially in the bridge and chorus.    My favorite lines include \\"I don't wanna touch you too much baby, cause making love to you might drive me crazy.    \\"When you make love, do you look in the mirror, who do you think of, does he look like me.\\"  The chorus is very heartfelt as well.  I love thissong!!!!!!!     Pour Some Sugar on Me-  Seriously, who hasn't heard this song.  It is a good song just extremely overplayed which is the reason I never listen to it on this CD.  Another fun song to listen to which a very memorable chorus.  I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time reviewing this song for you have already heard it I'm sure.      Armageddon It-  Sounds like a weaker version of \\"Animal\\"  Same topic, chorus sounds pretty close to being the same.  All and all it's a pretty good song, just not one I'll listen to over and over again.      Gods of War- A lot of people who like Def Leppard like this song but for some reason I'm just not crazy about it, It sounds good just not something I can hear over and over again, I tend to skip past this track every once in awhile.      Don't Shoot Shotgun-   I really like the intro of this song, always makes me laugh.  After that this song is just ok, nothing spectacular in this song at all.       Run Riot-  Here's a track that could have been on \\"Pyromania\\"  Just has a good metal feel to it.  Great song to listen to driving, windows down blasting out of your speakers.     Hysteria-  Musically, very simple.  Lyrically, one of the best flowing songs I've ever heard, especially in the chorus.  This is a song that I just can't help but to sing along to.  I'm sure you will feel the same way.  Two words describe this song, perfect melody.     Excitable- The intro to this song creeps me out.  Sounds like a filler track to me.  Nothing really spectacular about this track.      Love and Affection- My least favorite track on this album.  For me this album ends after \\"Hysteria because I'm just not into the last two tracks at all.  You might feel different about it however.        As much as I love Def Leppard, I just can't get into this CD.  Def Leppard went from edgy, aggressive hair metal to glamour sing along pop.  If you like Pop Metal, this album is for you, but if you are a big fan of Def Leppard's first 3 albums, this isnot the same band.
006054094X|5.0|Gavin Menzies not only writes a terrific thriller, but has produced a prodigious amount of evidence to support his claim that the Chinese beat the Europeans to the Western Hemisphere by more than 70 years.  He basis his theory on the facts that maps of the West existed before Columbus sailed, or by 1501 showed places with great accuracy that no European had been to.  Although the Moslem world had the best science at that time, they were not able to send such a large expedition.  Only China had the science, the knowledge, the ships and experience to produce those maps.  In 1421 Zheng He (someone every Chinese kid learns about the way American kids learn about Columbus)commanded a huge fleet of ships larger than any European ship on an expedition that went to India and Africa and then continued on.  The records of the voyages were destroyed, so Menzies uses evidence of the maps, the currents, the animal life that may have been left by the Chinese, plus a lot of compelling arguments to support his very detailed reconstruction of the voyages.  Some people have quarreled with some of the evidence, but with a theory as thoroughly supported as this one, one needs an alternate theory  that is better, and no one has one.  I've heard there's a new museum dedicated to Zheng He in China, and after reading this book, I'd love to go.
B0000457HB|5.0|Barry White is a living legend, this special 2 cds is recomended to anyone out there with good taste of music, whether a fan or not.<br /><br />Highly recomended!
B000035Z1Z|5.0|I LOVE this movie. This is one of Kevin Kline's best. Very well rounded characters, good character growth and realization, love the scenery, good for laughs \\"You people make my a** twitch.\\" \\"What? You think the plane is going to crash and we're all going to break in a million pieces?  Trust me... you won't feel a thing.\\"  Awesome story. I highly recommend this one if you want to impress a date who has a good sense of humor. :D
0671042858|2.0|This book didn't do it for me. And while there are obviously many people who love books where nothing happens and there's really no big point to be made, I'm not one of them. I could have spent the time it took to read this snoozer doing pushups, but instead I'm a scrawny guy with a super-dull plot crowding his subconscious. Thpppt to you, Stephen King, for stealing my muscles.
B00003CX5P|3.0|A friend of mine asked me once \\"how would you rate whether or not if a film is a classic masterpiece or not?\\" I kind of half-seriously said \\"if I think that I could've done a better job\\". Such is the case here. If I directed this, I would've changed many of the pacing issues, story concerns, and you guessed it, got rid of Jar Jar completely. But I can't so we have this, a film that could've been way much more. <br /> <br />Without getting too much into the plot, basic idea is that the Trade Federation set up a blockade of a nice little planet called Naboo. 2 Jedi are sent as negotiators(or peacemakers, either one) but as usual, things don't go as planned. The 2 Jedi end up encountering Anakin Skywalker, a surprisingly skilled pilot and even a capable Jedi. <br /> <br />The pacing is extremely off with the film. Which would make sense since this is the first of a six film saga so it has to set up characters and situations but even A New Hope, the first of one trilogy had better pacing than this. It's literally one action scene than nothing, a really quick action scene, a long lot of nothing, big scene(Podrace naturally) then nothing until the end where you got 4(!) events going on at once. <br /> <br />Of course the big issue with the film was Jar Jar. Extremely irritating, not funny and overdone. You could take him out and it would be a manageable film. With him in it, it's just, ugh. And surprisingly Darth Flannel, I mean George Lucas doesn't even apologize for the guy. He thinks he's good? Bah.  <br /> <br />But it's Star Wars and you can always count on action scenes and there's 2 that make the film: the podrace, where Anakin shows off his skills in a fast-as-hell race through desert and canyon terrain. And the lightsaber duel between our 2 Jedi good guys and the film's \\"villain\\". One issue I have with the duel however is that the moves look chereographed. Watching the duel between Luke and Darth Vader at the end of Empire, it's neat to show them being caught offguard or looking like they might get hit and just narrowly get a block but here it looks too...neat. <br /> <br />Also the dialogue is extremely bad. From lines like \\"now THIS is podracing!\\" and \\"I think you can kiss your trade franchise goodbye\\", it's obvious this needed a rewrite. Granted a line like \\"laugh it off fuzzball\\" seems grade 4-ish but at least the way he said it was funny. Here it's just cringe-inducing. <br /> <br />However as the first part of a 6 film saga and the great effects(if spectacularly overdone too), it makes it the worst of the series but somehow watchable. Somehow.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Of course the special editions kind of suck, but it's not that big of a deal. Especially Empire and Jedi, they hardly have any new stuff. You can skip the dancers during the Jabba sequence. True the ending of Jedi is ridiculous, but other than that it's practically the same movie. The most disturbing stuff is in the first movie. The scene with Jabba can be skipped. And the other stuff isn't that big of a deal. Sure, I would rather see the original movies, but people are making too big of a deal out of it. Plus the bonus disk in this set is almost worth the price alone. It is really awesome!
B000274THQ|5.0|Great movie with a lot of love and an insight into the life in East Germany.
B00005JNTX|4.0|This movie was cool as hell to watch!  This movie had lots of gore, violence, and sweet eye candy!  I liked the way it was shot in mostly black-and-white with a little color added here and there.  If you're looking for a movie that's very different, than most of the garbage you see today, this is it.  I loved the way they killed the pedophile twice in this movie, that was a great added bonus!  The disc has great sound too!
B00002R0MC|4.0|The songs are really nice but the sound of the CD is not up to my standars.
B00005JLPK|5.0|I'm one of those people who already knew \\"everything there was to know\\" about Frida Kahlo. By the time I was 13, there was nothing I wanted more in the world than to be an artist, although I didn't know of any female artists with the impact of a Picasso or a Matisse. Then, at 14, I saw Frida Kahlo's work and something inside of me absolutely danced with joy. She painted her own face! She painted her own birth! She painted her own feet! It was the most fabulous revelation ever to a 14 yr old girl.<br /><br />I was scared to see this movie, like you are when you love a book and know they may have butchered it to make a film. I didn't want my vision of Kahlo destroyed. I didn't want to see the pretty version of her life. It was as painful as it was passionate. The disappointments and tragedies were as real as the successes.<br /><br />Something inside of me danced with joy again as I watched this film. It's impossible to completely capture a life in such a short space of time; but, this movie did a wonderful job at capturing the spirit of Kahlo: her life, her art, her love for Diego.<br /><br />It is a beautiful film. I truly fell in love with it. It reminded me of the passion we are capable of feeling for art, politics, unfaithful lovers...a passion Kahlo kept for most of her life. The bright burning flame. In that way, it is an inspirational look at the life of the artist.<br /><br />Even if you are not as familiar with Frida, you can still enjoy this film, this story. In terms of a great story, her life was better than fiction.
B000004286|5.0|The best movie made, and the same can be said for the soundtrack.. Just magnificent!!
0141182601|4.0|I greatly encourage the reading of A Clockwork Orange; its use of language alone is reason enough. The incorporation of nadsat words emphasizes the separation of the teen culture from society in the novels setting. The difficulty I faced while beginning the novel surprisingly dissipated after the first few paragraphs. One quickly becomes use to the new language and Burgess writing. At first appearing as gibberish, after deconstructing the roots of the nadsat words, I understood the profoundness in the authors choice of words. For example, the name Alex, which is Russian in origin (as is nadsat), literally means outside of the law. As well as Burgess use of nadsat, he also incorporates repetition in Alexs narration, Then he flick-flickflicked with his bolshy (Burgess, p. 93). This style of writing really aided me in visualizing the events, despite the narrators lack of description of setting. The reader is forced to experience the books events from Alexs point of view, and I found that at times I felt I was in Alexs place. Additionally, in Alexs narration, he would describe the most prominent features of places and people, paralleling the way we remember things in real life. A Clockwork Orange, to me, was like a memorythings that were considered small were omitted or forgotten, but the story was told and the details considered significant were emphasized and described. In addition to A Clockwork Oranges achievements in language, its arguments of morality are insightful. The most fascinating point Burgess makes is about the need for free will, even if that results in one doing bad things.  In the novel, the government tries to end crime by removing freewill; however, this is no solution. Since in order to be good, one must choose to be good. The act is not what makes something immoral; it is the intent. In conclusion, A Clockwork Orange was unlike anything I have ever read, and because of its creative use of language, insightful messages and interesting plot, I highly recommend that it is read.
0385338686|5.0|Not since Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason have I been consumed by a book like I was with Sophie Kinsella's The Undomestic Goddess. I couldn't stop reading it. <br /> <br />Kinsella does an amazing job of coupling female insecurities with humor. Her work surpasses the fiction of other \\"chick lit\\" writers. Even though she places her characters in seemingly ridiculous and far-fetched situations, they are so well written and presented that  it's easy to fall for the plot.  <br /> <br />As a woman who has quite a lot of anxiety about managing work and a personal life, I immediately related to the main character of Samantha Sweeting.  <br /> <br />My advice to you: read the first few pages. If you're not immediately engrossed by Samantha's tale, then this book isn't for you. But, I have yet to meet anyone who didn't want to read the book after they read the first chapter.
1573223026|5.0|It's New Year's Eve, a major day for suicides, and four people happenstantially meet on the roof of a London apartment building, a well-known suicide venue known as \\"Toppers' House.\\" Individually, they might actually have topped themselves -- or maybe not -- but together, they just can't. They end up going back downstairs for coffee and, gradually, almost inevitably, they bond. They know nothing about one another at the outset, and they come from widely varying backgrounds, but as a \\"gang\\" of almost-suicides, they understand at least one very important thing about each other that most other people would not. And as often as they fall out, and as much as they frequently dislike each other in various combinations, they keep getting back together of the next couple of months.<br /><br />Maureen is fifty-one, never married, not especially attractive, and a recently practicing Catholic, but that didn't keep her from trying to do herself in. Her biggest problem is Mattie, her nearly-grown, severely retarded son, who absorbs every moment of her life, awake and asleep, to the complete exclusion of the entire rest of the world. As a result, Maureen is dreadfully naive but not hopelessly so; she's just very inexperienced. She's so desperate for change, for escape from her circumstances, that death seems very attractive. And she also has a way to unexpectedly cutting to the chase emotionally that makes the rest of the gang pause and listen and take her seriously.<br /><br />Jess is an eighteen-year-old royal screw-up, the younger daughter of the junior minister of education whose older daughter vanished four years earlier. Jess seems to function properly only when she's angry and picking a fight and being drunk and/or drugged. She's educationally challenged but not stupid, though she has a problem with similes and metaphors when she speaks and with \\"those speech mark things\\" when she writes. Her problem, though she doesn't quite realize it, is extreme loneliness because her uncontrolled behavior completely alienates everyone, and I mean *everyone*. It's simply her nature, and at least she knows it.<br /><br />JJ is a thirty-year-old American, a recently failed musician who has also lost his girlfriend. Even he recognizes that his motivation for suicide is pretty thin, so at first he lies and tells the others he has a fatal brain disease. He's also a self-educated school-leaver with a tendency to literary pomposity. But where he assumed he would be okay after his band failed -- because he could just do something else with his life, right? -- he's begun to realize that that's not true. All he really wants to do is make music. He'd like to be a *famous* maker of music, naturally, but it's the music that really matters. Especially since the other members of his ex-band, about whose futures he was worrying, are doing just fine with session work. He's looking at maybe a half-century ahead of him as a non-musician and he can't take it. Being a soloist doesn't seem to have occurred to him.<br /><br />Martin is, in Jess's words, a \\"tosser.\\" He was co-presenter on a successful breakfast-time TV talk show (think Regis and Kathy Lee) but he got caught sleeping with a fifteen-year-old girl, lost his job, lost his wife and two daughters, and went to prison for a few months. But he's selfish, self-centered, and superior. He's entirely a victim of his own stupidity (which he admits), not of circumstances like the others, but maybe that's just his nature, too.<br /><br />The author lets each of the four relate their adventures in their own words on a round-robin basis, Roshomon-fashion, and the juxtaposition of viewpoints on the same events is frequently hilarious and very revealing of what makes each of them tick. Hornby is a dab hand at characterization and he shows here that he also has the speech patterns of class and age down pat. I'd love to see this made into a film -- but not with Hugh Grant this time.controlled behavior completely alienates everyone, and I mean *everyone*.

B0009K7QZ8|1.0|I loved The O.C. Season 1. I was introduced to the first season by a friend, and after watching the first episode, I immediately bought the dvd collection.  <br /> <br />That said, when Season 2 came on tv, I was not impressed. What was once fresh writing, was now stilted and formulaic. After I watched the first seven episodes or so, I had to stop watching. While new characters were introduced the the inbred community that did make the show worth watching, the story line was so parallel. For example, if Ryan asked a girl out in one episode, Seth did the same. I began to feel like Seth and Ryan were living parallel lives. And the end of each episode would eerily wrap up the drama, while featuring the flavor-of-the-week band in a convenient concert. <br /> <br />It's sad because I really did love Season 1, but I feel like I could never see the end of Season 2 and my life wouldn't change. Maybe I have been spoiled by shows such as 24, Alias, and Lost, but a show has to provide some suspense. The O.C. lost me as a fan in Season 2 with its formulaic pattern and it's lack of plot.
0385486804|3.0|I have a profound admiration for Chris, the soul of this work, but why only one pic of him?  Why didn't the author take pain to obtain more pictures of him, be it childhood, whatever, like most biographers would do?  The big picture of the author back in the paperback I could care less.  Why not focus more on the subject instead of the author?  It ruins the mood for me.  It's supposed to be a comtemplative theme, Chris' life.  Why not show, instead of words?
B00003CXTG|1.0|A spectacularly great example in the Ben Affleck Museum of Mediocrity. It would be just dreadful, but its more the lack of humility and the debasing of a real tragedy that elevates this to the status of truly awful.<br /><br />This is like writing a cheap romance around 9/11 with lots of slow-mo shots of Ben and Jen running from the falling buildings to the sound of Aerosmith. I hope I haven't given the producers an idea for a sequel.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I heard this album quite by accident not knowing of her pop culture following.  I started by listening to her third song \\"walk away\\" and was, well...breathless.  It was hauntingly beautiful.  It is not alone on this album with that quality either, \\"Beautiful\\", \\"A Voice Within\\", and \\"I'm OK\\" also have that magical quality.  While I must admit there a several songs I skip EVERYTIME I listen such as \\"Makeover\\" overall this is in my top five vocal albums of all time.  Her voice is a true instrument which she is no doubt a master off.  I have listened now to all off her other work released up until this date, August of 2005, and unfortunately nothing is even remotely in the league of this album.  It seems she has finally matured, at least musically, with this album.  I very much look forward to other albums she may record, such as a blues album, a jazz album, etc.  I hope she does not keep that amazing voice limited to pop/rock!
6305327041|1.0|FOUR ROOMS was the single worst movie I ever attempted to watch, turning it off before the end of the second \\"room\\". Shame on Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, (currently two of my favorite directors), Allison Anders, and Alexandre Rockwell. It confounds me that it has an Average Customer Rating of four stars. I should have heeded the Amazon Editorial Reviewer and saved time, money, and effort.
0895260131|5.0|Finally a book that moves beyond platitudinous generalities -- that is, the typical analysis you find in the mainstream media.  This book focuses on what Islam is really about by going to the source -- be it the text of the Koran or the words of Islamic leaders.  In doing so Spencer doesn't whitewash the hatred of \\"other\\" that emanates from Islamic leaders from the highest ranks of the Sunni religious establishment in Egypt to the mosques of London which is likely the reason for the title.  Bravo to Spencer for one of the most important books of the year, if not the millenium (so far).

Superb special effects that STILL hold up 50 years later!<br /><br />FORBIDDEN PLANET(1957) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY(1968) are head and shoulders above all other Science Fiction movies.<br /><br />The producers of FORBIDDEN PLANET were able to convey a sense of \\"awesomeness\\" about The Krell's underground constructions, which are only equalled by the Moon scenes from 2001.<br /><br />The Theremin music is super eerie, and very well done.<br /><br />The Original STAR TREK pilot episodes THE CAGE and WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE are about the only things that approach the flavor of FORBIDDEN PLANET - but even those productions pale in comparison.<br /><br />FORBIDDEN PlANET is a MUST SEE for anyone claiming to be a fan of Science Fiction.
B00068NVI4|3.0|I managed to see one of the dates on this tour and had a great seat, about 6 rows from the stage in front of Steve Howe, but atrocious sound diminished an otherwise great night.  Much like my experience, this DVD continues the tradition of many Yes releases that simply do not live up to modern standards of sound quality.  Someone from the Yes production team really needs to listen to what's possible - like the sonically amazing Steve Winwood Soundstage release - and do a little more work.  Given the vast number of DVD's that have been released by Yes chronicling their great career, I hope that at least one of them will be sonically up to standard.  Thus far, none are. <br /> <br />The video quality however is another story.  Very clean and clear, well edited and paced, this is a very enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br />Performance-wise, the boys are in fine form this night.  Steve Howe especially seems unable to play a bad note.  There are times however when passion and enthusiasm seem lessened from earlier days.  The first few numbers go along seemingly without real engagement, picking up considerably with \\"South Side of the Sky\\" and staying at a high level until later in the evening.  The acoustic portion of the evening is a highlight.  Should they tour again, consideration should really be given to a smaller venue outing and an all acoustic performance - it's really that good.  \\"Ritual\\" allows for what might be the most incomprehensible percussion solo in rock history.  What was Alan thinking with those bizarre outrigger drums?  I've seen drummers do more with a pair of sticks and a high-hat than he did with all his massive set.  Unfortunately, the normally show-stopping finale of \\"Starship Troopers\\", while well played here, doesn't seem to be as energetic as in the past.   <br /> <br />But hey, why quibble; this is definitely one of the better (maybe the best) captures of this legendary band.  While the sound isn't up to par with the best, it is better than most of this band's previous DVD efforts.  Most Yes fans will be more than pleased.  I just can't help thinking it could be better still with more attention paid to the audio. <br />
B0002JJBZY|5.0|What can one say about Star Trek: The Original Series that has not already been said?  Nothing against the Next Generation, but the Original is still the best.  This is where it all began.  It's great to have all the classic episodes in an excellent compact package of DVDs.  I have always loved the banter between Spock and McCoy as well as Kirk's relationship with each of them.  The Romulans, the Klingons, the Gorn, Tribbles: now they're all preserved on DVD.
0679777547|4.0|I only dabble in mysteries because I find that all too often they are either too transparent or too dark.  Of course, the dark side of anything seems to be that which draws us into the story--where's the conflict when everything is working well?  Mysteries require death and darkness.  How many characters have been sacrificed on the altar of fictionary expediency?  But dabbling is often rewarded; I am glad that I found The Club Dumas and was pleased to find a uniquely interesting take on bibliomania easily analogized to any of the many interests that can imprison the willing.<br /><br />This work is a great piece of misdirection.  Frankly any commentary on the story risks betraying the device used with such skill by Mr. Perez-Reverte and which I believe sets this book apart as a great read.  And given the reverence of the characters for the works of Dumas, I suspect that I'll have to go start reading The Three Musketeers and Count of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />There is a great truth taught in this work.  Unsavory characters have unsatisfactory lives.  Further, why do we tend to embrace that which has no power to enrich?  Take the character of Fargas, the last member of a great family who has retreated into himself.  Fargas lives in his decaying family mansion, which is literally falling apart all around him, spending his time with his only friends--his books.  Not just books, but fantastically rare and valuable works.  Every year or so Fargas selects one of the treasures every now and again to \\"sacrifice\\" for the good of the others.  Yet despite the surpassing wealth represented by the pile of rare editions, Fargas can't seem to part with the books and restore his family's fortune.  Our protagonist, Corso, likewise has so retreated into himself that he questions the value of everything about him--yet he encounters a group that seems to find joy and meaning in the very books that Corso sees only as money.<br /><br />Regrettably, our author has doubts about the power of his language to portray the interpersonal relationships--if only he, as could Dumas, could have avoided the explicit descriptions of that which needs no description, the work would have easily secured a fifth star.ower of his language to portray the interpersonal relationships--if only he, as could Dumas, could have avoided the explicit descriptions of that which needs no description, the work would have easily secured a fifth star.
B0007UNV0E|4.0|Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.<br /><br />Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback by \\"Verbal\\" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As \\"Verbal\\" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of \\"Verbal\\" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.o is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Okay, I pratically grew up listening to Mariah Carey. And when I heard her latest songs \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\", I thought she has done a really good job! The beats are very catchy and good to dance to. This is the reason why I have to buy this album. And at my school, her songs are getting hot. I have to say that Mariah is a very beautiful lady with a great voice. But what really annoys me is that people would compare her to Madonna, J-LO, and Janet Jackson. They're completely different to Mariah!<br /><br />1- It's Like That- The first song that started it all. 5/5<br /><br />2- We Belong Together- It's the sequel to It's Like That. A very good ballad with very good catchy beats. 5/5<br /><br />3- Shake It Off- Another good song with good, catchy beats 5/5<br /><br />4- Mine Again- A nice R&B song with retro soul in it. And once again Mariah shows that she could truly sing. 5/5<br /><br />5- Say Somethin'- I love this song the best. I love the music and the beats. This song is sooooo hot! It's a nice song to dance with your special someone and your friends. 5/5<br /><br />6- Stay the Night- Nice song. It kinda sounds similar to J-LO's This Is Me...Then album. 5/5<br /><br />7- Get Your Number-Hmmmm....the music sounds very very familiar..I don't know maybe they copy the music from this 80s song called Illusion!!!!!! When I first heard the song, I was like wait a minute the music sounds very familiar. It's funny because yesterday some guy asked me if he could get my number. 4.5/5<br /><br />8- One And Only- Good 5/5<br /><br />9- Circles- Nice. 5/5<br /><br />10- Your Girl- I like this song. It's really cute and it has this kind of 70s feel into it. 5/5<br /><br />11- I Wish You Knew- Was this live or something??? And she sounds alot like Alicia Keys in this song. 5/5<br /><br />12- To the Floor- Nice song to dance to just like Say Somethin' 5/5<br /><br />13- Joy Ride- Beautiful song. 5/5<br /><br />14- Fly Like A Bird- What more can I say?? 5/5<br /><br />I really think that this album is very good to listen to with your friends and with your boy toy. It's her best one ever. It has a really good 70s soul and gospel feel to it. So I would give it a 5/5/.br /><br />I really think that this album is very good to listen to with your friends and with your boy toy. It's her best one ever.

B0002858YS|3.0|At first, I was somewhat impressed by the Killers' singles, but over the past year or so, it's become clear that the Killers are becoming rock stars for the sake of being rock stars.  Many might say that it's not a coincidence that frontman Brandon Flower's wife is the manager of an Urban Outfitter's store, that this band is just another case of mainstream-types taking stuff that was cool and turning it into watered-down versions of what it once was. <br /> <br />I'm sure the Killers respect their influences such as New Order, The Smiths, and all those other '80s groups, as is (a little too) obvious by their music, but the antics of Flowers, which I'm sure are calculated publicity maneuvers, mostly consisting of bashing other bands like the Bravery (which are lame derivatives of these guys) and the Stills (which are definitely a more genuine, multi-faceted, band than the Killers), cement in my mind that Flowers uses his song-writing talents and intelligence to put out extremely catchy songs that we just can't get enough (haha) of, basically relying on formulas perfected in the '80s and riding the success of recent bands heavily influenced by new wave.  Flowers reportedly kissed one of the New Order guys during some show they did together recently.  Flowers owes a lot to those guys and their cohorts, but he adds little and takes away a little too much for the sake of fame and commercial success. <br /> <br />This album doesn't stray too much from the singles, nearly all the songs are catchy, but there is nothing in this album that challenges us or forces us to rethink our musical tastes.  Flowers has made the genre repopularized as of late by Interpol and other indie groups totally accessible to everyone from your 60 year old math teacher down to 13 year old girls.  In the process, the edginess and varying moods and emotions produced by those bands have been stripped away in favor of easily digestible synthesizer-beats and chords that capitalize on the most pop-py elements of new wave.  Still, I'd rather see these fellas on MTV 24 hours a day than any boy band or American Idol contestant turned corporate revenue generator.  Comparisons between The Killers and Duran Duran appear spot-on to me.  Duran Duran and the Killers sacrificed much of what their influences strove for in their musical pursuits, but then again, who can deny enjoying \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" or \\"Mr. Brightside?\\"
0060751967|5.0|There are a lot of reasons to be a reader but one of the most important reasons we often forget is that it can be just fun.  This book was fun to read and has a new view of a well used topic.  I'll be looking forward to reading this autor's next books.  I'd bet she will be writing about the other people in this book in the next.
B00005O3VC|5.0|First off I have to I love the fact that they did nothing to fix this up from the original.  I would have hated watching this as a digitally remastered disaster.  This is a piece of nostalgia that you want to watch the same way over and over again. <br /> <br />This is the British humor take on the Arthur legend.  It is full of stupid humor that makes you cry with laughter.  There are no dry spots, it just keeps going with the comedy. <br /> <br />Interestingly enough I would probably give this as much historical accuracy as the newly released King Arthur which was a total disaster of a film.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|...since \\"Secret window\\" (Johnny Depp) though I have to say the story here was far more \\"watertight\\". It is intense to some level, you suffer with the main character in \\"The machinist\\" the way his life is being \\"plagued\\" by insomnia, and he looks like a skeleton -really. The problem is or was that I wasn't quite sure what kind of movie I was watching. The soundtrack is misfit; It has the music of a horror movie, and it is never scary, not even close. It is unpleasant, shaded and sad. This mans' life looks like a nightmare, Christian Bales' performance is indeed impressive (and not only because his great loss of weight for this part). However; The outcome was rather predictable, and I soon suspected where it was going, and I was close. <br /> <br />So all in all -more drama than thriller. The movie makes you \\"feel\\" because of an sympathetic main character and great actor for the part. But nothing amazing, nothing remembarable. Ok movie.

B000001ELR|5.0|CREATURES OF THE NIGHT(1982).KISS' eleventh(studio)album. <br /> <br />By the time it was 1982,even though KISS had been the biggest band of the late 70's,things had not been going to well for them lately. After Peter Criss had been fired from the group and Eric Carr(RIP)had taken over for Criss,KISS' 'Music From The Elder' concept record and their 'Killers' compilation had both not faired well,and Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley wanted to get themselves away from their concept record,which had turned a lot of people against them. How would the new KISS record,an attempt for the band to reinvent themselves and get away from the corny image they had given themselves after 'Music From The Elder' meausure up? Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This record has proven to be one of KISS' best albums--and definitely one of their most underrated albums also. When this CD came out,not only had Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley been trying to get away from all of the crap they had been getting lately(which was due to firing Peter Criss and the following KISS records:DYNASTY,UNMASKED,MUSIC FROM THE ELDER,and KILLERS)but they had been having a lot of trouble with Ace Frehley. As already mentioned above,even though Frehley's face is on the cover of this album,Ace himself is nowhere to be found on here--the only reason why Ace's face is on this album cover is because he had not officialy left KISS when this album came out,and Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley needed sort of needed the Spaceman's face on the cover of their new album(and again,there are a bunch of different guitarists on this CD). The album itself? Read on for my review of this and you will get a rundown of every song on here: <br /> <br />CREAUTURES OF THE NIGHT:WOW!!!! What a great way to open an album. Eric Carr's drumming welcomes this song in a strong,harsh,and absolutely brilliant way,and after Carr's excellent drum intro and the loud and heavy guitar on this track(Steve Farris is the guy who is playing drumson this track)have begun,Paul Stanley's lead vocals....which are some of Paul's best vocals ever...do a brilliant job at taking on the rest of this track. This song is heavy and great filler from top to bottom. 10/10 <br /> <br />SAINT AND SINNER:Wasn't strong enough to be a hit or a single(and it wasn't)but still a really good track. It is really catchy and has a really good hook to it,and the fact that Gene Simmons wrote and sang this song and the other fact that this song has the lyrics \\"Without You,it's Aces high\\" should tell you all you need to know about this song.9/10 <br /> <br />KEEP ME COMIN':The heavier sequel to CALLING DR. LOVE.10/10 <br /> <br />ROCK AND ROLL HELL:Written by Gene Simmons,Bryan Adams,and Jim Vallance and sung by Gene,this song tells the story of a rock star in sort of a hell for rock stars only who wants to get out. Far fetched,a little bit of a stretch,but still a really good track that shows the heavy metal edge Bryan Adams used and applied in his songwriting before he became famous. 7.25/10 <br /> <br />DANGER:A suspenseful track that has really strong and worried lyrics and music to it,and a track that also has the words \\"I'm going insane and I like it\\" written all over it. Need I say more? 10/10 <br /> <br />I LOVE IT LOUD:The best track on this whole album(in my opinion)and the guitar playing on this track(which was played by Vinnie Vincent)and Eric Carr's awesome drumming are the highlights of the show here. One of KISS' best songs that is real fun to play LOUD!!!!!!!! 9/10 <br /> <br />I STILL LOVE YOU:A heavy ballad that has love and heavy metal written all over it. Sung from the point of view of a guy who has upset his girlfriend and still loves her...when Paul Stanley sings this song,he sings it with a lot of care and concern,and his vocals sort of the bring this song to life. And we thought that Paul and Vinnie Vincent(who helped Paul write this song)didn't have hearts. 10/10 <br /> <br />KILLER:A quite intersting song abouta female killer...quite intersting and really good though,and maybe a little bit of what you would call a \\"mind\\" song. 8/10 <br /> <br />WAR MACHINE:A really good song,and a very succesful way to close an album. Another collaboration between Gene Simmons,Bryan Adams,and Jim Vallance,and it is killer heavy from top to bottom--Gene Simmons' vocals and the guitar on this track(which I believe was played by Vinnie Vincent)shred on this track. <br /> <br />There you have it all. If you buy this expecting a sequel to DESTROYER,ROCK AND ROLL OVER,and/or LOVE GUN,then you probably won't like this CD....however,if you buy this CD knowing everything you need to know about it,then you will be blown away by this album. <br />
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie is about America's first official military engagement in the Vietnam theater.  It is an outstanding movie that truly portrays what happened.  It is taken through the collective works of Lt Col Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Photo Journalist Joseph Galloway (Barry Pepper) <br /> <br />You will see the training of the U.S. Air Cavalry led by a determined Commanding Officer, LTC Moore, and a Grouchy CSM Basil Plumley (Sam Elliot).  Sergeant Major Plumley portrayed by Sam Elliot was simply brilliant.  He could have been any CSM anywhere at any time in any war.  He was the battle toughened crusty old man that had been involved in the airborne drops at Normandy and at Arnhem.  Whenever he spoke he more than carried the scene. <br /> <br />If you want a vietnam movie that sticks to the basic facts of life in the Army both as a soldier and the families that had to deal with it then you will like this.  The battles are realistic.  The dialogue is genuine, it is one of the first movies were the soldiers actually talk like soldiers.  This is devoid of politics, devoid of protesters, this is simply what happened.  To top it off it is accompanied by a haunting soundtrack. <br /> <br />Enjoy this, they don't get much better. <br />
B0007TKNII|5.0|I didnt see the play or know anything about this movie.Then my mom rented this and i loved it we went and bought it.I only wish it was the 2- disk set.The movie is amazing i love it ,the songs, acting and eveything else about it. Whatch it its good!!

B000060MMI|5.0|I loved this CD. It's very upbeat and fun, while not being mainstream ans pop-y like almost everything else out there.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I of course love all the Dire Straits stuff, they were perfect for the time. Now that Mark Knopfler is doing his own stuff, he's free to do what he wants, play beautiful music and sing whatever he wants to sing about. Some of it is the most poignant music you'll ever here, some of it you wonder why he bothered. However the really great songs are worth hearing, and often. I'm afraid to miss one of his albums, because there are always songs that hit you in the gut, make you laugh or cry or both. Let's face it, the guy keeps getting better and better.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|The last of the trio of Crim's mid 70's line-up, although I think it was recorded before Starless & Bible Black if I'm not mistaken, but released afterward.  Maybe not.  Still the basis for Crimson in the 21st century if you listen to Red & the Power to Believe back to back, Pat does his Bill parts very well, yet adds a lot of his personality, where as Fripp said, Pat saved King Crimson.  Indeed, long live the King.  And double thanks for the KC Collector's Club releases.  Hope you print some more of the Nighwatch Live CD's & Red in an album type sleeve (Made in Holland) sticker. etc.  DGM really was a great idea after all these years of being a Crimhead (30 yr.) can't wait for the new Larks Tongue in Aspic on Sept. 13th.
0714845183|5.0|JW Waterhouse is one of those myriad Victorian painters whose works appear in 'books beautiful', covers for art magazines and programs, and in general, works for the boudoir.  Touches of femininity such as found in his many works have been regarded as kitsch, not allowable in the museums or important art collections.  Humbug!<br /><br />Peter Trippi at last places Waterhouse's output in a light of respect and examines his paintings with reference to the times in which they were painted and the social and gender biases of the Victorian era (biases which extended well into the 20th century!).  He further offers apologies to the artist for our neglect in a way that raises our attention to a new level of appreciation.  This book is lavishly illustrated with superb color reproductions of full paintings and details of paintings.  Trippi's writing is scholarly and immensely readable.<br /><br />It is a joy to see works of the past century enter the arena of fine art.  Time moves slowly: first the Pre-Raphaelites and now JW Waterhouse and his fellow painters of myth and romance.  A fine volume and excellent introduction to the topic. Grady Harp, August 05
0385512058|5.0|An excellent book; I believe every teenager should read this book, the sooner the better. It is a must read because the subject, networking, is a very important aspect of today's life when, more than ever, excellent human relations are fundamental to succeed. In the last two weeks I have sent the book to several of my nieces and nephews, and to some friends. Your children will always be grateful if you present this book to them.
B000AARKOO|5.0|After reading many of the reviews of this film before me, it occurs to me that most of the people who did not like the film seem to be stuck on the fact that they thought it portrayed Christians in a bad light and Muslims in a perfect one. These people are deluded and most likely went into the movie thinking / hoping that would be the case so they would have something to complain about. Other people, like me, went into the movie hoping it wouldn't be propaganda for another invasion of a Middle-Eastern country. I was not disappointed, in fact I was amazed at the brilliance and truth to Ridley Scott's film, which shows not only absolutely no mercy to extremists on either side (NO-ONE can say that the Templars were in the right on their side, nor were extremists on other sides in the Crusades.... in fact, they were just BAD), but it also has a message of \\"Why are we fighting over the city that makes all our religions what they are? Why can't we just stop and make peace?\\"
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Wow, no media attention at all. I just noticed this when I was trying to add a Michael Jackson to the Now Listening To part on my xanga site. This has definitely got to be one of the finest collections of songs by Michael Jackson. Includes songs from The Jacksons group as well, which is spectacular! Each of my 8 favorite songs are on this CD, it was amazing when I picked it up! The title of the CD says it well, it is essential for any Michael Jackson fan.
B00006LFGD|5.0|In November of 2002, Barbra Streisand released her fourty-first album entitled, DUETS. This CD contains every duet that Barbra has ever recorded. Three songs on this album are pretty bad, but the rest of the album is just outstanding. <br /> <br />I WON'T BE THE ONE TO LET GO (Duet with Barry Manilow) <br />New song. I was shocked to learn of this song. I cannot believe that both of my mother's favorite performers have recorded a duet together. This is a beautiful song and it talks about how two lovers will never leave each other.  <br /> <br />GUILTY (Duet with Barry Gibb) <br />From the album GUILTY (1980). I never liked this one. There's just something about it.  <br /> <br />YOU DON'T BRING ME FLOWERS (Duet with Neil Diamond) (Duet Version) <br />From the album BARBRA STREISAND'S GREATEST HITS VOL. 2 (1978). Original version from the album SONGBIRD (1978). Beautiful song. <br /> <br />I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE (Duet with Bryan Adams) <br />From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES (1996). Beautiful song. It's obvious that the song is about how two people found the perfect lovers... each other.  <br /> <br />CRYIN' TIME (Duet with Ray Charles) (Duet Version) <br />From the boxset JUST FOR THE RECORD... (1991). Original version from the album BUTTERFLY (1974). Not a good song. Ray Charles' voice is horrible.  <br /> <br />I'VE GOT A CRUSH ON YOU (Duet with Frank Sinatra) <br />From Frank Sinatra's album DUETS (1993). Okay song. Although Frank's voice is not bad, I cannot call myself a fan.  <br /> <br />TELL HIM (Duet with Celine Dion) <br />From the album HIGHER GROUND (1997). From Celine Dion's album LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE(1997). Celine's voice in one corner, Barbra's voice in the other corner. These two have made the right choice in recording a song together because their voices are absolutely out of this world, especially when they sing together.  <br /> <br />NO MORE TEARS (ENOUGH IS ENOUGH) (Duet with Donna Summer) (Single Version) <br />Original version from the album WET (1979). Barbra's music is considered easy listening. Donna's music is considered disco. Who would have known that an EASY LISTENING artist would team up with the best DISCO artist? The original version is actually 8 minutes and 19 seconds long and it can be found on Barbra's album WET. The 12\\" version is actually 11 minutes and 43 seconds and can be found on both Donna's albums ON THE RADIO: GREATEST HITS VOLUMES 1 & 2 and THE DANCE COLLECTION. This has to be the best DIVA duet ever, in front of LADY MARMALADE, by CHRISTINA, LIL' KIM, MYA, & PINK.  <br /> <br />WHAT KIND OF FOOL (Duet with Barry Gibb) <br />From the album GUILTY (1980). This is the only Barbra Streisand/Barry Gibb duet that I ever really liked. So much better than \\"Guilty\\". <br /> <br />Medley: I HAVE A LOVE/ONE HAND, ONE HEART (Duet with Johnny Mathis) <br />From the album BACK TO BROADWAY (1993). Beautiful song. <br /> <br />Medley: ONE LESS BELL TO ANSWER/A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME (Duet with Barbra Streisand) <br />From the album BARBRA JOAN STREISAND (1971). Absolutley amazing and to make it a duet with herself is beyond incredible.  <br /> <br />LOST INSIDE OF YOU (Duet with Kris Kristofferson) <br />From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack A STAR IS BORN (1976). Pretty song, but Kris needs to stick to what he's good at: ACTING!  <br /> <br />TILL I LOVED YOU (Duet with Don Johnson) <br />From the album TILL I LOVED YOU (1988). Great song, but Don, stick to what you're good at.  <br /> <br />MAKE NO MISTAKE, HE'S MINE (Duet with Kim Carnes) <br />From the album EMOTION (1984). Great song. <br /> <br />IF YOU EVER LEAVE ME (Duet with Vince Gill) <br />From the album A LOVE LIKE OURS (1999). Beautiful. <br /> <br />THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT (Duet with Michael Crawford) <br />From the album BACK TO BROADWAY (1993). Beautiful.  <br /> <br />DING-DONG! THE WITCH IS DEAD (Duet with Harold Arlen) <br />From Harold Arlen's albumHAROLD ARLEN SINGS WITH FRIEND (1993). Silly!  <br /> <br />Medley: GET HAPPY/HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN (Duet with Judy Garland) (Live) <br />From the boxset JUST FOR THE RECORD... (1991). Judy's voice is absolutely amazing.  <br /> <br />ALL I KNOW OF LOVE (Duet with Josh Groban) <br />New song. Beautiful song. Should have been released as a single.  <br /> <br />Whoa! Nineteen duets with in the last 39 years. Barbra really likes her duets. Buying DUET means you'll be getting Barbra's greatest duets, with the exception of \\"Guilty\\", \\"Cryin' Time\\" (Duet version). This is such a great album and it is waiting for you.
B00005JNTX|2.0|Don't get me wrong, the movie looked great but it was still a major bore. It was slow and the comic-book dialogue only made it cheesy. I saw it in the theater with digital projection and I still found myself checking my watch. Unless you're a comic book dork you're probably better off finding something else to watch.
B00079018K|1.0|What rubbish! Not only am I not going to buy this album, but now I'm going to use this an example to spread the word about the recording industry's greediness and why file sharing is totally justified. Music belongs in the hands or artists and fans. Kill the middlemen! <br /> <br />This will no doubt inspire many to dust off their copies of Kazaa Lite and download everything they can find from KASABIAN - while vowing to NEVER pay for their music so long as their studio uses copy protection.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|I lost a lot of respect for Roger Ebert for bashing this film the way he did. As Vincent Gallo himself has said, it was irresponsible of such an influential film critic to attach the \\"worst movie ever\\" stigma to a film like this. Sure, Ebert used the minor edits to this film as an opportunity to atone for his irresponsibility and make a complete about-face, but the damage was done by then. This film's reputation was damaged, very possibly beyond repair, forever. Now you have people attracted to the film just because they want to see a trainwreck; a lot of people who wouldn't normally have been inspired to see a film like this, who very likely wouldn't have understood it anyway, just wanting to laugh at and rip apart the alleged \\"worst film in the history of the Cannes film festival.\\" A soulless Hollywood blockbuster type film can withstand that kind of criticism; a difficult, \\"not for everyone\\" indie film, especially one made by such a polarizing figure as Vincent Gallo, cannot. I've seen worse movies than 'The Brown Bunny'. I've never seen 'Gigli' or the '05 'Dukes of Hazzard' starring an all-star cast of master thespians like Johnny Knoxville, Stiffler from 'American Pie' and Jessica Simpson, but I strongly doubt this film is worse than either of them. It isn't even worse than 'The Dreamers', 'Elephant', 'Garden State' or most of the other bullcrap that gets praise in the indie film world today. <br /> <br />As for the film itself...it's nothing like what you've heard. Many people watched this film and saw a tedious excersize in narcissism, \\"endless\\" driving scenes, and finally, graphic oral sex. I saw a fascinating portrait of a broken man's confusion, complication, emotional immaturity, and his resultant misery and emptiness, set against some beautiful scenes of the American landscape. 'The Brown Bunny' is not for all tastes, but in no way is it among the worst films ever made. It's not even close. To me, this film stands as proof of three things: first and foremost, Vincent Gallo is still a misunderstood genius (now more than ever); major film critics have incredible power when it comes to the reputation of independent film; and finally, people love to whine, complain and tear things down, and any time you give then an excuse to do so, they'll jump all over it. If you can't take \\"independent\\" cinema that is truly unconventional and creative, go watch 'Garden State' or something. Everyone else should watch this film, try their best to forget the naysayers, and remember that many great films, music, and other pieces of art were misunderstood and written off upon their initial release because people weren't ready to understand or accept them. If you don't like it, you don't like it. But calling Vincent Gallo's 'The Brown Bunny' the worst movie ever? To paraphrase the man himself, \\"save that for when they make 'Rocky 10' and put Nicole Ritchie in it.\\"

B00006JJ51|5.0|While there will always be something to be said about hip-hop artists who incorporate rational, intelligent social commentary into their rhymes, there's also something undeniably captivating about a group motivated solely by violence, hate, and oppression.  Public Enemy may have been all about fighting the power and the Black Panthers and all that, but NWA was just out to shoot some cops and trivialize women, and you've gotta respect that.  They just rapped about what they knew.  Which do you think more accurately reflects the mindset of disillusioned urban youth in the 80s: gang members or Farrakhan-namedropping zealots?  NWA is simply a cold, sobering slice of reality.  They weren't about social change; they were about expressing the present moment exactly as is.  And to this day, there has never been a better or clearer document of urban street life in music.<br /><br />As for the raps themselves, Ice Cube, M.C. Ren, and Dr. Dre's occasional appearances are all incredible.  Each has a different vocal and lyrical style, keeping the record dynamic and interesting throughout.  Eazy-E, however, has obnoxious delivery and easily the dumbest lyrics on the album.  \\"Shinin' the light in my face and for what? / Maybe it's because I kick so much butt.\\"  Huh?  Gangsters say \\"butt?\\"  Unintentionally hilarious if you ask me.  Fortunately, Cube and Ren more than make up for E's fumbles.<br /><br />All in all, an essential hip-hop document, even if it's not the most poetic or intelligent disc on the rap market.

0140182829|3.0|I read The Grand Meaulnes after knowing it had bee a major influence in FowlesThe Magus: I read it with real interest and expecting a great literary work: I was extremely dissapointed: I have read far better bad books by French authors: The book seemed to me just that bad French style: mysterious; mystic and set in a misty atmosphere: That is my only credit to the book; the autumn green and brown and rainy atmosphere it evoked; a depressing setting that is not fully depicted and::: The Great Gastby lacks that \\"mystical\\" atmosophere but tells the same story; that of something you lost and you want to recover no matter you spoilt your life in the pursuit of it: Nothing new or fascinating in the Grand Meaulnes as far I am as concerned as a reader
B00006BTCA|5.0|I bought this CD only after I became familiar with \\"Antics.\\" As \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" was its predecessor, I did not expect it to be anywhere near as good as Interpol's sophomore release, but truly, I find the quality here to be rather shocking. It is extremely complex both lyrically and musically. By the third or fourth listen, I realized just how excellent it was. I'd place it just a notch below \\"Antics,\\" which makes it one of the strongest offerings of the last five years. The comparisons often made to the Furs and Joy Division I do not regard as being completely accurate. Certainly, they did not \\"rip-off\\" their music. Interpol may be derivative, but being altered by those who produced music before you is inherent to the process of creativity. Few artists or musicians come on the scene devoid of identifiable influences. Personally, I love The Psychedelic Furs, but I do not believe that appreciating Interpol in any way cheapens the achievements of Butler and company. Many of these songs are haunting and feature lyrics nearly as interesting as those penned by Butler or even Morrissey. In this era of rap, we should be grateful for musicians who sound like these guys. If you ask me, I say, \\"Well done!\\"
B0000AGQ6P|5.0|This is one of my favorite Spielberg films. Not only does it have the imagination of what a Peter pan  movie should be like, it's got a great cast. Robin Williams is great as Pan the man and Dustin Hoffman is an incredible Hook. I couln't even tell it was him at first.

B00005JLPK|4.0|This film is not only about the fascinating life of the twentieth century Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo, but also about  her muralist husband, Diego Rivera.  In a sense we get two biographies for the price of one! We are treated to views of many of their artistic works. As if that were not enough, there are delightful Mexican songs to entertain us.  One is sung by Salma Hayek herself, and she's not bad.
B0002YLC24|5.0|If you are looking to get this DVD because you enjoyed Before Sunrise, I recommend that you do.

074322454X|5.0|What Ambrose accomplished in his painstaking interviews with WWII vets, such as those that became the book Band of Brothers, was the creation of treasures for the archives of our nation.<br /><br />This book lets the surviving men of Easy Company tell their own stories and the stories of their brothers in arms, from the rigors of basic training in Georgia, to combat preparation in England, through their role in winning \\"the day of days\\" June 6, 1944. This one company of soldiers was present in nearly every major engagement of the European theater from D-Day forward, and, via incredible circumstances, was even the first group to reach Hitler's private lodgings, the fabled Eagle's Nest in the Bavarian Alps. These were men from all corners of our nation and all walks of life, who rose to extraordinary challenges and were heroes for all time.<br /><br />In Band of Brothers, unforgettable men stand taller than the figures of fiction. They deserve to be immortalized in this work and I hope this is one book that stays in print and is avidly read by Americans for many generations to come.

B00005JNTX|3.0|Not surprisingly most of the rumours circulating about this film (as it is with most films for that matter) were inaccurate. Not all, but most. <br /> <br />It was supposed to be ultraviolent to the point where it could disturb some viewers. Not the case. Aside of one single scene everything else we've seen before on this violence level. In fact, to me this film worked more as a very dark comedy than anything else. <br /> <br />Then again it turned out being very close to an art-noir film, something not included in all the talk before the film was released. It has all the characteristics of being artsy: clever and intriguing use of color, surreal city-scapes etc. <br /> <br />Where it falters is (again not surprisingly) in character development. Keeping in mind that it's based on a comic, we should rememebr that when one reads a comic he builds the characters himself. You tend to attribute traits to characters as you read a comic or a book because your imagination plays a much more active role compared to watching a film. It's the difference of the medium that dictates this.  <br /> <br />In Sin City most of the characters are shallow with the exception of Bruce Willis who's given unequally more depth than the rest. At some point it all gets too close to a very stylistic but smallminded slug fest where body parts are flying away , various characters are blasted to smithereens, chopped or gunned down. <br /> <br />But still the film works, mainly because of its unique premise that there's no hero on the good side involved. Everyone in Sin City is a doomy shady character, every relationship has a strong dark side, every mission has evil intentions, the whole city lives and breathes under dim ominous lights. That's the biggest success of the director and his crew, that they managed to bring acroos this atmosphere very convincingly indeed while delivering it with an artistic overtone. <br /> <br />Despite the shortcomings, Sin City is worth watching and if the other rumours are true (i.e the creators planning to turn this into a long lasting movie series) it's obviously bound for commercial success as well. <br /> <br />But having spoken of very dark comedy, the very first 40 minutes where Mickey Rourke is involved are gonna draw some serious laughs from those with a more flexible sense of humor. This is a character where the word \\"unsubtle\\" applies with a vengeance. <br /> <br />As far as Rodriguez is concerned Sin City is easily an improvement over Once Upon A Time In Mexico. There could be further development from him to see.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This is pure genius. Folks it says this album has 16 songs but it has a 17th and an 18th track there hidden, so be sure to check that out. Anyway lets get to the album. Great tracks we got here. Truckin, Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil, Operator, Candy Man, and Sugar Mag. All on one frickin' album. Beautiful. Its like a greatst hits album. If your interested in this i also recomend the Live/Dead album or In the Dark. Yes Short review but i hope it gets the job done
B0002M3V0C|5.0|I will admit that I usually don't buy albums from groups/artists who get lots of airplay in mainstream radio.  I figure that I hear it enough in malls, and TV, etc. - so why bother buying the CD?  So in this case I opted for the Import edition of \\"Songs About Jane\\";  but even so (comparing it with the standard version's track listing), the album is great! <br /> <br />Without getting into the specific tracks to much, I will just say that I was just blown away by the vocal skill and versatility of Adam Levine.  On some tracks the group dips into poppy hip-hop a-la N'Sync (which is fine in small doses!) and on other tracks they sound very soulful and jazzy.  The musicianship also sticks out in that many of the groups nowadays will not change key, or meter like Maroon 5 does.  The acoustic versions are also a nice bonus.  It gives the album that exclusive underground feel you don't get from the radio singles. <br /> <br />20 years from now when people talk about the music from 2003, I'm sure that \\"Song About Jane\\" will be on that list.

B0000256VK|5.0|Avalon is arguably the best rock album of the 1980s but this remastered version certainly shows the staying power of this classic masterpiece by Roxy Music.<br /><br />\\"More than This\\" remains a masterpiece of double-speak with its line \\"you know there is nothing' implying either there is nothing beyond the relationship or a more existential statement that life is relatively meaningless and thus we bring meaning into life and into the relationship.<br /><br />\\"The Space Between\\" sizzles with tension and unique phrasing with Brian Ferry's haunting, ghost-like pleas.<br /><br />\\"Avalon\\" is a lush intimate masterpiece. The opening lines 'Now the partys over...\\" leads into a song about rebirth of a relationship.  The ultimate love making song.<br /><br />\\"India\\" and \\"Tara\\" are two short mood creating instrumentals that are woven perfectly into the pattern of lyrics and melodies. The saxaphone in \\"Tara\\" is as sharp as a sun rise.<br /><br />\\"While My Hear is Still Beating\\" is the most mournful of the songs with its sad, brooding, moody tone.<br /><br />\\"The Main Thing\\" will make you realize the influence of Roxy Music on The Talking Head's Stop Making Sense.<br /><br />\\"Take a Chance with Me\\" has links to such diverse talent as Chris Issaks. Chris Issaks seems like the synthesis of Roy Orbison and Bryan Ferry.<br /><br />\\"To Turn You On\\" with its sexy delivery of lines is great. Ferry makes the line \\"It is raining in New York, down 5th Avenue\\" sound full of longing and begging.<br /><br />Every song is strong. This 1982 album remains a beautiful treat, an erotic tapestry of lush, elegant, graceful music.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Like most of the oasis fans, i was eager to get a copy of this album on its release date. I've read good reviews about this album before it was released and it made me more excited. When finally i got my copy and started listening, instantly i got hooked. This is one album that i sometimes found myself doing nothing but just listening to the songs and still get satisfied. My dad and I are huge Beatles fans and and we both find most of the songs comparable to Beatles tunes. If the Beatles were get to pick one album that they can claim as their own, this is that album.  <br />I am also a big fan of Coldplay but I did not like their X&Y album at all. They continue ripping their own songs. And Chris' vocals is starting to get tiring.  <br />Go and give this album a try.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I cannot explain to you how much I love this album. It's amazing and has inspired me so much. <br /> <br />American Idiot- I love this song. I think it's really catchy. <br />Jesus Of Suburbia- All parts of this song are great. I especially love I Don't Care.  <br />Holiday- This is the first song that really got me into Greenday. This song is really catchy and the video is great. It's another song about the Iraq war and American goverment. <br />Boulevard Of Broken Dreams- This has to be one of the best Greenday songs ever made. The lyrics are very sensitive and Billie Joe's voice is great in this. <br />Are We The Waiting- This song is great, especially the verses. It reminds me of a Greenday concert and this would be great to perform. <br />St. Jimmy- This is one of my favourite songs ever. The start is very punk and the chorus is especially good. <br />Give Me Novacaine- It's based on an acoustic guiatr and drums. Billie Joe's voice is once again brilliant. <br />She's A Rebel- A great song. It sounds like American idiot slightly.  <br />Extrodianry Girl- This song is good but it's not like it's my favourite. I don't get why there are loads of weird drums at the start but apart from that the song is great, especially the chorus. <br />Letterbomb- This song is one of my favourites on the album. It's amazing! It doesn't really have a structure other than a chorus, but it's still pretty good. <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends- This is about Billie Joe's father dying when he was only 10. It's very emotional and it goes with a great video. <br />Homecoming- A live version of this song was on the WMUWSE single and it made me want to buy the album. The best parts have to be Nobody Likes You and the Death of St.Jimmy <br />Whatshername- This song starts of slow and is based on drums and guitar. It starts of slow but ends like a rock song. It;s pretty good too! <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|4.0|One of the sad realizations i have come to in the recent years of movie production (and a possible reason ticket sales are at an all time low as of late) is found in Hollywood creativity and new ideas. Sadly, there just isn't any, and if you think Movies are lacking fresh ideas, turn on the TV set after reading this review, but i digress.  <br /> <br />In my years of movie watching i have enjoyed a variety of movies that set the standard in regards to their genre of story telling. For example as far as star sagas and wars are concerned nothing will likely come close to Star Wars, as far as horror in space, ALIEN might well have the title there, demon possession, one only need watch the Exorcist in the dark alone, where the battle of man against machine, i guess is a throw up between Terminator and The Matrix. Such movies have set the bar relatively high with the quality of their stories; thus leaving other movies with similar topics often to seem like cheap imitators. (Now to all you people who are saying get to the point, the movie review)  <br /> <br />For quite a while i would have easily said that Pulp Fiction set the bar pretty high in regards to the brand of producing that had multiple stories all tied together. However, it would appear that Sin City took a great idea and just made it better. This movie takes a style of talk and feel of the 30's, mixed colorization of the 60's, violence and sex of...... well pick a year I'm sure it will fit, and the special affects of the 90's and beyond, and rolls it all together into a visual masterpiece. In this movie you will see Mickey Rourke play one of his best roles ever as Marv. Sadly (although i love his work) Bruce Willis play his traditional role of the down and out cop who breaks the rules to save the day (he played it well in this movie but not really a stretch for him) and although his role was small, the most mesmerizing role might well be found in a Fine Young Cannibal named Kevin (Elijah Wood) (sorry for thespoiler). <br /> <br />The one fine point i liked about Pulp Fiction was in the Karma to be found within the story, in that in the end everyone pretty much gets what they deserve and that sometimes the people we believe to be good really ain't so good at all, and it takes a unique, sometimes nasty form of justice to make things right. Such a point touched on in Pulp, is the center of SIN CITY in a nutshell. <br /> <br />Is it the best movie ever?........no, but it may be one of the best of its kind. If you are the type that can't appreciate the story, just go into it for the sheer artistic and creative value this movie presents and i think you will be moderately pleased. Oh if you didn't already know this movie is not for the squeamish. <br /> <br />The only disappointing aspect after watching this movie is knowing i might have to wait another 5 to 10 years for another fresh idea to come out of Hollywood to set a new standard and make me want to return to the theaters. <br /> <br />P.S. Hollywood Moguls looking for a fresh idea (A Marv prequel)

You will be surprised what were the levels of control at that time in the most respectful bank in Europe and in the world.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|I was totally blown away by the acting and the production of this movie.  If Hitchcock were still around, this is exactly the type of movie he'd probably be making.  If you are into psychological suspense, see this movie tonight, it's amazingly well done.
0451169514|5.0|Set aside your prejudices and minor quibbles(too much curse, too long, autobiography etc etc), this is a very complex story which would certainly be a total flop if it were attempted by a less talented author. This is the first King I have ever read  and King simply maestros all the dazzling events switching between '57 and '85, and all seven starring characters supported by a huge supportive cast, and of course, the Pennywise, and the story never loses momentum at any time. Seven friends -in their childhood and adulthood lives- practically jump off the pages to your room or you simply fall into Derry...The book isn't what you could a truly horrifying experience- King loves to put nice jokes here and there but there are truly terrific parts-in particular when the history of the Derry comes forward, you cannot help but feel chills all over your body how the entire town overlooked the miserable fates of their children and how they avoided their cries. The storyline has much depth than it seems at first- our childhood fears and how adults seem to be deaf to them- actually seem to be pleased that we have them-is one of those thought-arising understreams. King deftly paints bucket-loads of a simple small town as well as the USA of era- when he is talking abouk 1957 you simply expect to see Frank Sinatra around the corner and in 1985 the Terminator man when you look outside the window. The town and its secrets unfold before you like a very advanced version of Civilization game, pushing you all the time against the forces in Derry. King justifiably deserves his crown. Only this kind of storytelling -with all its faults and merits- could propel the horror fiction into the mainstream world. King is the undisputed champion of his genre- actually, it seems, he created a genre of his own which matches with horror fiction at the closest-  and is one of the best storytellers I have ever read. <br /> <br />In short, I laughed, I feared, I was thrilled, I had chills, I was dazzledby the grotesque images and almost cried a few times over the book but what is more I felt that I was within the story...And. contrary to one reviewer who feels robbed, at a price of a mere 8.00US$ I  felt very satisfied to have read several wonderful books at the price of a single book and actually think the book is underpriced, considering that it is over 1000 pages and it has several great substories inside it... Now move on to Salem's Lot. <br /> <br />
6305078491|4.0|I watched Carl Dreyer's \\"Vampyr\\" last night.  I have also seen his masterpiece \\"The Passion of Joan of Arc\\" and I am fully impressed with his ability to let the camera tell a story.  His camera's perspective, the use of lighting and double imaging, strategic close-ups, and letting the actor's expression convey a message stronger than dialogue could deliver; all these make for an impressive cinematic experience.  Because \\"Vampyr\\" is a horror movie, it is all the more effective because of Dreyer's talent.  This is a dark, shadowy movie that is long on image and short on dialogue.  In fact, I'm not sure why this film was done in sound because the bulk of non-visual communication was written; not spoken.   <br /> <br />I'm not sure I followed everything each step of the way in \\"Vampyr\\".  However, I had the continued sense of the presence of evil.  There was one scene in particular where one vampire smiled at the prospect of her intended victim.  That smile was so evil that it sent a chill down my spine.  This is a movie that could be praised simply for its' early innovations.  However, it still packs a punch.  Watch alone on a dark night and find out for yourself.
0895260131|3.0|Let's be honest here... to assume that Robert Spencer knows anything about Islamic faith in the first place is key to reading his book. As any well-rounded human being knows, even the most well-read, and oldest clerics, in any faith, have a certain perogative in their beliefs. No one person can define the role of religion in the lives of others. The people that argue that their lives are dictated by their faith are blinded by ignorance. Human intuition and the insinct towards deviation has been proven througout history over, and over again. <br /> <br />Spencer only adresses one, extremely literal, transliteration of the Koran. He certainly poses a peircing arguement, but that doesn't mean his opinion should sway the masses. Broaden your horizons people, get out there and read more than just THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT GUIDE TO ISLAM. Accumulate all the information you can, then do with it what you please. I would not consider Spencer's book well-rounded at all, but perhaps the written form of the same zelous he talks about in his book.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Wow. I have seen this movie 4 times at the theaters already; 3 out of 4 times ending in applause. Each time as I left the theater, my cheeks hurt from smiling so much. I think it is absoultely fantastic. For me, this movie is like Pirates of the Caribbean; I never get tired of watching it. <br /> <br />Although Johnny Depp is probably better-suited in a more serious role, once again his acting is phenomenal. I found myself laughing out loud many times at his quirky comments and girlish giggles. I don't see anything \\"creepy\\" about him. He is a loony but genius man who was forced to raise himself, and probably with very little human contact. It can only be expected that he be a little, uh...eccentric. He is really just a child at heart, traumatized by his strict, dentist father (a very interesting twist to the story). And when his guests arrive, he is uncertain as to how he should act around them, but he is thrilled showing off his factory. I think Depp's Wonka is just as lovable and charismatic as Wilder's Wonka. Deep Roy (as the Oompa Loompas) is absolutely hilarious. He may be the best part of the entire movie. It was very clever to have one actor play the Oompa Loompas, rather than several. The Oompa Loompa songs were great as well. The lyrics are taken straight from the book, unlike the '71 version. The colors and graphics are so amazing...I could almost smell the chocolate. Not to mention Danny Elfman's music. After I saw this movie for the first time, I immediately bought the soundtrack. It is excellent. <br /> <br />As far as comparing this movie to the old one, I think this one is much better. The only thing about the '71 movie is Gene Wilder-I do admit he was good. Other than that, I think the old movie is terribly boring. Burton's movie never has a dull moment. Today's technology has allowed this movie to be the way it should be: a delectable feast for your eyes and ears. It is also much much funnier than the old movie...all the characters make me laugh atone point or another-not just Wonka's character. I especially like Violet Beauregarde's mother. She is very comical. <br /> <br />Do be warned, however: one time I saw this movie, a girl about 2 or 3 years old was sitting on her dad's lap, and she was scared to death of this movie...(she covered her eyes when the squirrels attacked Veruca, and she cried when Violet turned into a blueberry)...but I would think any children over the age of 4/5 would approve. <br /> <br />Exciting, vibrant, hilarious, goofy, sinister, heartfelt, eccentric and just plain fun...this movie is thoroughly enjoyable!

0441003257|5.0|The Earth was created October 21, 4004 BC, around 9 AM (fossilized dinosaur skeletons being a joke paleontologists haven't seen yet).  \\"That went down like a lead balloon,\\" said Crawly the serpent - \\"I mean, first offense and everything.  I can't see what's so bad about knowing the difference between good and evil.\\"  It was then that he changed his name to Crowley and became the devil's representative on Earth.    Over the next 6000 or so years, Aziraphale (the good angel) and Crowley worked out a comfortable arrangement.  It seems that agents of all sorts have more in common with their competitors than with their superiors (whom they rarely see).  If they unspokenly agreed to a non-interference clause, they could both demonstrate to their masters that they were making remarkable headway against their clever adversaries.  When the Apocalypse was announced, they agreed to a secret meeting at the duck pond, along with all the other spies.    Summary of characters:    Sister Mary Loquacious - A Satanic nun from the Chattering order of St. Beryl, her assignment being the newborn nursery baby switch.  When she first met the Anti-Christ AKA the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan and Lord of Darkness - she talks sweetly to him and plays with his toesywosies.    Newton Pulsifer - A witchfinder and descendant of the witchfinder, Thou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer (names were more descriptive in those days).  He'd like to believe in a Supreme God, although he would prefer a half-hour chat with Him before committing himself, to clear up a few points.    Adam - The 11 year old Anti-Christ who grew up in a normal home as a normal kid (despite his powers) because of the botched baby swap by Sister Loquacious.  He says, \\"I don't see what's so triffic about creatin' people as people and then gettin' upset 'cos they act like people...Anyway, if you stopped tellin' people it's all sorted out after they're dead, they might try sorting it all out while they're alive.\\"  The Megatron's (Voice of God's) face begins to take on the look familiar to all those subjected to Adam's idiosyncratic line of reasoning.    Madam Tracy - A loveable tarot card expert (she took all the evil cards out of the deck) & medium who was forced into partial retirement from prostitution by age.  She lived next door to witchhunter Shadwell and brought him cookies.    Shadwell - The witchhunter whose teeth were bad enough to make the tooth fairy take retire her wand.  On Sundays, Madam Tracy left a plate of food outside his door...she couldn't help but like him.  For all the good it did, though, she might as well be flicking bread pellets into a black hole...in Shadwell's simple world anyone wearing sunglasses who wasn't actually on a beach was probably a criminal.      Crowley - A snappy dresser who always wore sunglasses, Crowley was a demon who rather liked people, even though his job, which he did well, was to do his best to make them miserable.  Usually, however, he couldn't think up anything half as bad as stuff they thought up themselves...and just when you'd think they were more malignant than ever Hell could be, they would occasionally show more grace than Heaven ever dreamed of.  \\"God does not play games with his loyal servants,\\" said The Megatron.  \\"Whooo-eee,\\" said Crowley, \\"where have you been?\\"       Aziraphale - Angelic representation on earth.  Although he was, of course, neutered, some thought he was gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous oxide.  Scrupulously good, but not pompous enough to carry a righteous demeanor, his cover was book store owner, and his hobby was collecting Infamous Bibles with errors in typesetting.    The Four Bike Riders of the Apocalypse - joined by a group of mortal Hell's Angels and commissioned by Satan himself to find the lost Anti-Christ on the fateful day of Armageddon.    Crowley and Aziraphale take you on a wonderfully paced journey full of insights and witty observations on life.  Pratchett and Gaiman don't let you down as their eccentric cast converges for the climactic scene.  Mark Twain, author of \\"Letters From The Earth\\" would approve of \\"Good Omens,\\" the funniest version of the Apocalypse ever written.  Highly recommended.

Simply unbelievable. <br /> <br />The plot is quite unrealistic and complex. I got bored after page 150. The same happened to me with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Deamons\\".
B000083C49|4.0|Foregoing the heavy drama of the first 3 films, Star Trek 4 is actually more or less a comedy classic due to its hilariously anachronistic nature: folks from the future trying to get through a \\"modern\\" world and all of its quirks.   The ultimate message of the film--save the planet for future generations to enjoy--could have been heavy handed but is beautifully covered by ample doses of seriously laugh-out-loud humor which even non-trekkies would enjoy. This is one of the best \\"fish out of water\\" (pun intended) films ever created.  Previous reviews cover the storyline well enough so we don't need a rehash of that. I'd rather like to focus on the humor present in this ostensibly light-hearted look at a serious matter. Imagine Spock trying his best to sound \\"modern\\" by swearing, or watching Scotty try to use a \\"modern\\" computer. The laughs do not stop. McCoy and Spock's dialogues are gut-wrenchingly funny. Here are some examples:  [McCoy trying to discuss what death was like with Spock]  McCoy: Perhaps we can cover a little philosophical ground. Life, death, life. Things of that nature.  Spock: I did not have time on Vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines.   McCoy: C'mon Spock, it's me, McCoy. You really have gone where no man's gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?   Spock: It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference  McCoy: You're joking.  Spock: A joke...is...a story with a humorous climax.  McCoy: You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?  Spock: Forgive me Doctor. I'm receiving a number of distress calls.  McCoy: I don't doubt it.  .........................    Spock: Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with, shall we say, more colorful metaphors--\\"double dumb-ass on you\\" and so forth.   Kirk: Oh, you mean the profanity.   Spock: Yes.   Kirk: Well that's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you unless you swear every other word....................    [Spock is still learning how to use profanity correctly]   Spock: They like you very much, but they are not the hell \\"your\\" whales.   Dr. Gillian Taylor: I suppose they told you that.   Spock: The hell they did.   ...........................  Kirk: Spock, where the hell's the power you promised?   Spock: One damn minute, Admiral.   ...........................   [After deciding to travel back in time--much to McCoy's distress--Kirk asks Scotty about the possibility of customizing a room in their Klingon ship to contain water for the whales]  Kirk: Can you enclose it to hold water?  Scotty: I suppose I could. You planning to take a swim?  McCoy: Off the deep end, Mr. Scott!  Kirk. We've got to find some Humpbacks.  Scotty: Humpbacked...people?  Kirk: Whales, Mr. Scott. Whales!    The anachronistic comedy is used ingeniously here, and makes this one hilarious, but ultimately serious, film. An absolute classic. Personally, I feel that \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" is the most fulfilling film in the series, but you simply can't go wrong with \\"The Voyage Home\\" for non-stop laughs.   And you don't need any \\"LDS\\" to enjoy it.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was 9 years old!  I never seem to tire of watching it - with its' great cast, awesome music, and adorable story line, I don't know of anyone who doesn't like Grease!<br /><br />John Travolta & Olivia Newton John mesh perfectly in this 1950's romance film, and the rest of the cast is great as well.<br /><br />Grease is a musical about 2 late-teens who had fallen in love while on summer vacation.  They never thought they'd see eachother again, as they lived in different states.  But then, on the first day of school they see eachother - here her family had moved, but she never knew it was to HIS school district!<br /><br />These two are VERY different!  She is a shy, quiet, goody-t0-shoes, and he the tuff type.  Although they eventually try to make it work, these differences seem to be to much for them to overcome...<br /><br />So, will they get back together?  Will he change or will she?  I won't answer these questions, as I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen this movie yet.  Suffice it to say that this is an excellent love story, set in the 1950's, and with awesome music.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Of course, this was the original, classic car chase movie of all time. It also expresses the world-weariness of the gifted but, mistreated driver and the unique free spirit days it was made in.  <br />  BUT, as an interesting footnote to this movie, when I first saw it at the drive-in in the early 70's there was a difference in the version than any I have seen afterwards. At the end, (WARNING-and this can definetly be seen as a *S P O I L E R*!!)-at the crash scene while the cops and people lingered and the last of the music played, they had a few little paragraphs put  up, like newsclips after the fact, and it included, (I cannot recall the exact wording, sorry),the basic statement that the body could not be found and it had disappeared. Does anyone else recall this at the end of the movie? We never forgot that. Anyway,I found it intruiging enough to make mention of-GREAT movie regardless.     <br />      Supercharged! Vrrooommmm....
B000001FDK|5.0|I was only 9 years old when this movie came out, and I still remember my friends father taking us to the theater to see it - we were still singing the songs to eachother way past our bedtime, and loving every minute of it!<br /><br />Then, when I was in my 20's, I remember being at various clubs & bars that would play the music from Grease, and every time the entire place would come alive with everyone singing along - its just that kind of music - your feet seem to start moving and your voice start singing before you even know whats happening...<br /><br />The music from Grease in definately 1950's in style, and includes rock-n-roll, doo wop & ballads - there's quite a lot of variety when you think about it.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed the movie/play &/or likes 50's-style music.  You won't be disappointed!
0061020710|2.0|I got this book on a whim about 2 ago for a light read. I had never read any of Terry Pratchet's books but I had heard his books were similar to Douglas Adam's, which I particularly like. I was disapointed. I thought it started off good enough, once I figured out what was happening. After that though, it went down hill. I thought the different stories got less amusing as they went along until I finially stopped halfway through the last one. Another thing I didn't enjoy was how each of the \\"chapters\\" was infact a different story and didn't tie to the others at all. They didn't seem very well developed and I didn't like how I felt as though I was starting off another book every chapter. Finially I didn't find any of them terribly funny. I really do like satires but it just wasn't coming through to me in this book. If you want to start reading Discworld with this novel I don't suggest it, I'll be renting my next one from the library instead.
B00001NFCY|3.0|I don't understand why people keep saying Creed were a Pearl Jam ripoff band.  These plagiarism accusations are entirely unfounded.  It was the late 1990s people!  It was only a few years after Pearl Jam's heyday, and it was only natural that new bands coming out in the late nineties would sound similar to one of the most popular bands of the earlier part of the decade.  Whenever a band like Pearl Jam becomes popular, they influence up and coming artists.  There's nothing wrong with that! <br /> <br />The truth is, Pearl Jam and Creed are similar bands, but that does not make Creed a ripoff band.  They are just two 1990s alternative rock bands that play similar styles of music.  As long as the lyrics are not word for word, as long as the riffs aren't note for note, you can't seriously claim that Creed copies another band!  But don't just take my word for it; look it up!  As far as I know, there is no law against sounding vaguely similar to another recording artist!  You can't copyright a musical genre!
B00005JNTX|4.0|Most action films today, or in any day, rely on special effects and explosions more so than plot and character development. Although \\"Sin City\\" is not a complete exception, it is a stand out from other \\"click, click, boom\\" action movies.<br /><br />The movie comprises of interlocking stories throughout involving different characters. These stories aren't like \\"Seinfeld\\" where each of them dose something different that somehow relates to each other and everything is resolved at the end. Much like the story telling of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" or \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", the movie is shown out of sequence, to relate with each character's segment.<br /><br />The acting for the most part is what stood out for me. Excellent performances by Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood, who gives one of the most creepiest villain performances I've seen, without uttering a word.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. Not only did he co-direct the movie, he \\"shot and cut\\" it (yes that is an actual credit, just look at the back of the DVD) and directed the music as well. I guess when he made a movie over a decade ago with a $7,000 dollar budget, he knows how to do different jobs.<br /><br />The only fault in \\"Sin City\\" is that it is hard to have a strong connection with the characters. When one dies, and many do, you don't have such a strong feeling as you would, say if the movie surrounded one character. The only \\"main\\" character seemed to be Bruce Willis. Yes he seems to be reprising his role from \\"Die Hard\\", but he dose it well, and for me was the one of the only characters you cared about.<br /><br />Final thought: The movie is not as violent as you are lead to believe. Kill Bill or the Matrix was more violent than Sin City, but the violence is in a \\"comic book style\\", and to sum up what that means here, the blood is almost entirely white...
0156027321|4.0|The novel Life of Pi is about a boy named Pi Patel. Pi lives in India with his family where his father runs a zoo. Pi loves animals and spends lots of time at the zoo. Pi's family decides to move the zoo and all the animals and Pi's family board a cargp ship. However, a great storm sinks the ship and Pi is left stranded on a life raft with a hyena, a bengal tiger, a wounded zebra, and an orangatan. Over the course of some two hundred to three hundred days, Pi is left alone with a Bengal tiger because, using his knowlegde of animals, he learned to to feed the tiger in order to stay alive.  <br />      I enjoy the Life of Pi beacuse it was different than what I am accustomed to reading. ALso, I relate to Pi because he is a young man who is spiritual and finds good things about many different religions. SOmetimes the truth is not always true, and Pi exeriences this late in the book. The reader learns that the truth is not as important in the long run beacuse what Pi went through and felt on his journey internally was much more significant than what went on externally. Pi was clearly a mature character, and learning from Pi helps the reader acknowledge his desicions and believe Pi's tale, even if it menas believing that Pi....

0743454537|3.0|My Sister's Keeper is a novel about a girl who develops leukemia at a young age, and needs certain cells to put her into remission. Neither one of her parents, nor her older brother fit the exact match as a viable donor, and the only fate left to the poor child is death. One of the doctors however mentions to the parents that if they develop an ideal baby, then they can use the stem cells from the umbilical cord to heopfully save their daughter. Nine months later, a new baby is born, and the first daughter's leukemia is put into remission. As the two girls grow older, the older daughter, Kate, continues getting sick and then gets put into remission. By the age of thirteen, the younger daughter, Anna, is in the hospital just as much as the sick daughter donating blood, platelets and bone marrow. Then Anna is told that she must donate a kidney. Anna is tired of being poked and probed, and finally puts her foot down and takes her parents to court for rights of her own body. As the parent are fighting in court against one daughter, the other is on her death bed at the hospital while their son has completely rebelled out of their control. The end of the novel plays out the decision of the judge, and the decision of the yongest daughter and the fate of the family.  <br /> <br />I chose to read this book because it was recommended to me by two different people who said that I would like it. It was also written by an author that I had previously read and enjoyed. this book is a pretty fast read once you get into it, because you want to find out what the final outcome is. I enjoyed the entire book except for the end. When i finished the book I wanted to tear out the last chapter and have it finish a little earlier. It was well written and held my attention and then just let me down at the end. The ending was completely unexpected and disappointing. Although I didnt enjoy the ending, I'm not quite sure what would have made a better ending. Being an identical twin who was given a kidney by her identical twin sister, I felt parts of the story I could really relate to or recognize.  <br />Overall, even though the ending was a let down, knowing the author I should have figured her endings are unusual and should have prepared myself. I am nevertheless glad I chose this book to read. <br />
B0009353IW|5.0|As a \\"Lost Angel\\" even though I live half-way 'round the world from the city of my birth, I was immediately immersed in the brilliance of this magical CD.  Because of my background I know Los Angeles, some of its history, much of its multicultural mix and too much of its chequered politics.  Chavez Ravine is but a metaphor for the growth of, arguably, the ugliest city in the world and Cooder has explored in the many parts of this remarkable CD only one painful piece of this awful puzzle.<br /><br />I have never written a comment about music and although I have bought Cooder albums since Chicken Skin in the '70s, I have never felt musically secure enough to comment but after  listening to this CD I felt moved on many levels to comment.  Cooder has produced such a powerful mix of music and politics that separating the various pieces is a daunting business for a listener like myself.  However, I have appreciated Flaco Jimenez since Chicken Skin and therefore I loved his two contributions on this CD: Corrido de Boxeo and Ejercito Militar.  Second from the end, I admit to having tears in my eyes listening to 3rd Base, Dodger Stadium-a song that cannot but pluck the heartstrings of any person that knows the saddness of dislocation.<br /><br />Decades ago I was touched by the assaulted culture of the Latino people in Los Angeles from the movie and soudtrack of \\"Zoot Suit\\"-a Latino culture that arose in Los Angeles before I was born and Chavez Ravine spoke of similar cultural manifestations.  I hope that there are more Ry Cooders out there who will enlighten America to the richness of Latino culture as well as the depth of inhumanity visited upon that culture in the names of progress and nation building.<br /><br />Beyond my comments-buy the CD and read carefully all Cooder's accompanying notes and enjoy music at it's best!
0393035158|5.0|This book has become new personal bible!  When I read it I found myself constantly saying \\"Yes.  Yes!\\"  Finally, I felt, somebody was saying the things in public I had been thinking in private for a long time.  I first borrowed this book from a friend who felt Harris was particularly down on Muslim to the point of calling him 'racist', so I was somewhat prepared going into it.  But I think he makes a clear distinction between the majority of Muslims and the basic tenets of their faith.  If you are looking for a thoughtful, rational look at the problem with religious thinking, this is the one.
0140177396|5.0|This is a great book--two very different men brought together by certain circumstances.  I love the way the characters compliment each other.  I recommend this book to anyone.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Every frame is a work of art. One star? Two Stars? Three Stars? Four Stars? All are incorrect. This is five star fried gold. There have been no greater films made.
0140120416|5.0|I am a beginning Russian student who has been studying Russian independently, and I have found this book to be an excellent resource. I have not relied exclusively on written coursebooks, but also made use of Pimsleur's audio program and Declan's Flashcards on the computer to help with pronunciation and spelling. This book is invaluable for learning basic principles, and as an aid in understanding the fundamentals of the language....I am not by any means finished with it...I do highly recommend the book to anyone who is studying Russian. I feel confident that I will continue to progress with the study aids available...and this one is definitely one of the best!

0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand, was recommended to me by my brother. He told me it had a strong impact on him and his perspective on life. I decided that if this novel could have such an intense impact on its readers, it was a book worth reading.  <br />       The novel is primarily about Howard Roark and his battle against the world and its desire to destroy him and his ideals. Howard Roark is an architect whose greatest joy (and believed purpose in life) is to design and create buildings. Roark is an idealist, for he stands strongly by his principles-even when faced by extreme poverty. His struggle against society is characterized by his individualism (or egoism). Self-reliance and self-respect are his virtues; virtues not held by the common man. Roark's buildings are reflections of his human spirit, for they embody his ideals - self-respect and integrity. His buildings are condemned for their lack of beauty, yet they are praised by their mathmatical and structural genius. Roark's buildings do not contain an external facade; they have no columns, no arches. They simply, completely, and beautifully fulfill their purpose, displaying man's capacity for greatness. The novel depicts the life of Howard Roark and his individual perfection while contrasting the lives of weaker, more corrupt, and more successfull men such as Peter Keating and Ellsworth Toohey.  <br />      Ayn Rand's philosophy regarding egoism and individualism is extremely controversial due to its extreme repudiation of common conceptions. I believe certain aspects of her philosophy are quite beautiful and profound, but other parts are also radical. There is beauty in self-respect and individuality, which is depicted through Howard Roark and his unfaltered passion for designing his buildings with integrity, without corruption. Yet Rand condemns all acts of \\"selflessness\\" for she believes that these acts are truly selfish in the immoral sense. Seemingly selfless acts are often used to obtain power and control over those who are supposedly receiving aid. However, I believe there are exceptions. There are people who believe in God and truly desire to help others who are in dire need of it, who also believe in man's capacity for greatness, who may have both self-respect and humility. The novel is worth reading for it is a poignant story as well as a profound social commentary.
B000093BDX|4.0|My daughter and I have found a CD that we both enjoy.  Now, I do have to tell everyone that she is only 2 and The Wiggles are her favorite music, but this is a CD that is full of fun and energetic music.  We can dance and sing all day.  Plus, she can associate the beach boys with growing up at the beach.
B000002MP2|1.0|The reviewer below is why the music of Green Day should be abolished. It rots its listeners' brains. Green Day is not Punk, first of all, and secondly, even if they were, they still wouldn't be the first to record on a major label. There were plenty of \\"Punk\\" (actually, it all sounds more like Pop to me, and charted as such) bands that were on majors. The Sex Pistols were with EMI (a division of Warner Brothers), and The Clash were on a major as well. Hell, even Black Flag got on a major before Green Day.
B0000025JT|5.0|I was a senior in high school when this album came out, and it was a monster success back then.  The title song Guilty is quite simply one of my favorite songs of all time.  It's the best song Barry Gibb has ever written and produced, which is saying a lot because he's been involved in too many to count.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is a side splitting, laughing out loud dvd set.  I promise you will absolutely enjoy this and watch and rewatch it many times.  My teenage son loves it also.
B00000JR29|4.0|One of the great recordings of the 80's with the Classics \\"Shout\\", \\"Everybody wants to rule the world\\" and \\"Head over Heels\\". But the real gems are the unknown songs on this recording: \\"The Working Hour\\" and \\"Broken\\", but especially the absolute fantastic \\"Listen\\", repeating the same pattern of melody over 6 minutes, giving you the feeling that it could go on forever. This song alone is worth the whole album!
B00005JMAH|3.0|Very entertaining, but it was not as good or exciting as the first two.  Unfortunately this is what you get sometimes with sequels.
B00005QAPH|4.0|This is a classic film , but some people used to Hollywood type films may well find it baffling . This is why the Criterion DVD is so helpful to those who like me are happy to admit that they find it difficult to follow and appreciate having it explained to them on a second viewing via the commentary . <br /> <br />The visual world of Fellini is like none other . <br />This film would be great for those going through a mid life crisis , but luckily the rest of us can find something in it . <br />One of the questions it puts forward , is 'could someone start their ( internal ) life again' ? The main character has many parellels to Fellini , but forget about that when watching . <br />There are ideas about creativity , intellectuals and the movie business itself .  <br /> <br />I note there are a lot of used copies of this DVD as it is not one you watch for entertainment , or often for that matter .  <br />It is unashamedly 'arty' , so keep that in mind . <br />Rent before buying . <br /> <br /> <br />It is a film everyone should see , though .
6303921248|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie, no matter what version, old or new.  I have all versions.  There is something to be said for this verison with it's grandeur.  It's a real feel good movie that anyone can enjoy and Colin Furth, which I would not consider overly attractive, does have a winning charm that no lady can resist.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is a film that has been done justice via the DVD format .  For those who like to listen to commentaries , be warned that the audio quality is not that good . It sounds as if there was a blanket over the microphone whilst it was being recorded , but Mel comes across as very human and rightly gives a lot of credit to the cinematographer .    Many people will find the battle scenes stirring , though if you would like to get an idea of where some of the influences were from , I would refer you to the Orson Welles film called CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT . The DVD is available from Ebay sellers and it is manufactured in Spain .    BRAVEHEART is an epic film that doesn't feel like it .     Great escapism and period flavour .  Highly recommended to lovers of films like BEN HUR .
B0002858YS|4.0|i enjoyed \\"hot fuss\\" very much. the killers have a truly unique twist to their style of music.
B000002J3W|4.0|This is not the best cd that Skid Row has put out. Most of the songs on this record are really good. The song writing on the record is a little step down from the 1st and 2nd albums. However, I think you can feel thier emotion as they play and sing in just about all the songs.  Between Sebastians singing, Snake and Scottis guitar, Rachels bass and Rob on the drums- Skid Row has made a good record!!!!!
B00082IJ08|4.0|their music is pretty funky and offbeat. i think it's fresh with beats and tunes that many have not heard before. it's the kind of music that you listen to while you're high or on mushrooms, as it extracts this dazed and altere-conscious emotion from you.
0441003257|4.0|I love discworld books and fell in love with Gaiman's masterful storytelling in the Sandman novels and then moved to American Gods.  So when i saw this book i immediately added it to my collection.<br /><br />The story is done really well.  Essentially if their is a goofup in the whole Apocalypse deal.  It was really funny, there was a part where this policemen is watching the demon guy pass in a fiery car.  The description of it made me laugh out loud, which doesn't happen very often from books.<br /><br />The only downside to this (for americans) is the fact that much of the humor was lost to me.  Some of the jokes that I knew were funny, but couldn't bring myself to laugh because it seemed you had to have lived in England for some period of time in order to understand it.<br /><br />Overall you should read it, great story.
0316666343|5.0|Difficult to put this book down.  Considering that the central theme this book revolves around is the rape and murder of a young girl, you still find yourself drawn in, wanting to follow Susie's story from heaven and for her family left on Earth.  And also what happens to her killer.  I will be looking forward to the next book written by Alice Sebold.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Persona is probably my favorite Ingmar Bergman film.  Watching it again, I now realize that it is a ghost story.  Were ever characters more haunted than Bergman's?  Everything about the film is eerie, especially the music.  Everything has the feel of a horror film, even though nothing \\"scary\\" actually happens.  The horror is of Being and Nothingness.  Persona does what so much of horror literature attempts - undermine our conceptions of what is real.  Bergman is not content to do only that - he undermines the conventions of moviemaking as well: half-way through the movie, the film breaks and needs to be re-started. <br /> <br />It is almost impossible to summarize the \\"plot.\\"  Liv Ullman's character decides to stop talking.  She is sent to a summer home in care of a nurse - Bibi Anderson.  Gradually, the two personalities begin to merge until we realize that there may have only been one person in the house to begin with. <br /> <br />Persona is an art film if ever there was one.  It stands next to 2001: A Space Odyssey as one of the great experimental pictures of the 1960's.  It contains one of the most erotic scenes in cinema, even though there is no nudity.  It foreshadows a new era of filmmaking. <br /> <br />The DVD transfer is pristine, however it is NOT letterboxed.  For some reason the subtitles remain white, instead of the more user-friendly yellow.  There is also an invaluable featurette on the making of the film with interviews of all the principals, including Bergman.  A must for any serious DVD collection.   <br />
B00000I07P|4.0|A very good rock album that appeals to the ladies as well; from complaining in the past that their cds of their prior albums sounded worse than the cassettes of other artists, they can have no complaints here as the remastered versions sound very good indeed.  Recommended!
B0007WZX9O|5.0|I could go on about every song on this album and the greatness of Pink Floyd and that would be perfectly fine and honest.  However, all I want to say is that this is simply the most underrated album release in the history of rock and roll.  This album is very sensual, soothing, dramatic, and even emotionally violent at times.  Sure, Roger wasn't there and we're all sad about that.  On the other hand, Pink Floyd did not die and anybody that listens to this album with an open mind will come to quickly realize that. <br /> <br />This is not an album that will immediately impact you the first time you play it.  Play this album periodically and let it grow on you.  Eventually, if you appreciate the work of Pink Floyd the way I think I do, it will become a major component of not only your Pink Floyd collection but of your entire music collection.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I never ever read of or herd of Sin City, until I saw the comercial.  My friend tho', he wouldn't stop whinning about how much this movie was gonna suck because the men who directed Once upon a time in mexico, and Kill Bill were gonna screw it up, and that Frank Miller was nuts even considering to work with them.  But when the movie shut him up, he wouldn't shut up about, you gotta see this movie.  So I checked it out.<br /><br />Hartigan(Bruce Willis), a man sworn to protect the law, and a little girl, Marv(Mickey Rourke), a man who want's the one responsible for his only true love, and Dwight(Clive Owen)a man who has a reason for going to Old Town, are all the 3 main focuses on Sin City.  When things go wrong for the situations that happened for these 3 guys, they a;ways have that matality to prove that they're still worth a d@mn, but will it be enough to get them out of the situations they are deeply into?<br /><br />I love the movie's feel for bringing the comic book to life.  I only saw pages of the comic on the movie, but it just feels so much like a comic book.  I mean, this is nearly true comic brought to life.  The black and white CGI fast paced cartoon feel is definitly a upside to this film.  It also contains comic humor, like Jackie Boy's(Benicio Del Toro) slow yet utterly rediculas death, when Marv dragged a guy on the street by his car while driving, and Miho(Devon Aoki) throwing a shrukien that looks like something that will upset a certain group of people.  And the cool dialouge is also another factor that makes it stylish, and my personal favorite cones from Marv:\\"The hell I send him too must seem like heaven after I'm through with him.\\"<br /><br />Sin City is definitly a comic book brought to life.  My whining friend instantly fell in love with it.  He ownes all covers, and s trying to grab every poster made.  Me, I'm just glad I got the oppertunity to see such a fine crime-drama action comic style movie like this, and have enough money at the time to buy it.  I like this more than Spider-Man 2, The Crow, but it's hard to choose between this and Batman Begins.  But anyone interested in the Crime/Drama action or Frank Miller's Graphic Novels should definitly check this out.  Whenever Sin City 2 comes out, I'll definitly be anticipating it.<br /><br />Peacee time to buy it.  I like this more than Spider-Man 2, The Crow, but it's hard to choose between this and Batman Begins.  But anyone interested in the Crime/Drama action or Frank Miller's Graphic Novels should definitly check this out.  Whenever Sin City 2 comes out, I'll definitly be anticipating it.  <br /> <br />Peace <br /> <br />
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This is Dylan's most personal album. It is about his marriage that crumbled apart. Though the songs are sad the music is beautiful. It was like Dylan was back to himself after experimenting for awhile. Songs like You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go and Buckets of Rain make me cry at times. Dylan proves he is a gifted songwriter and shows that his own problems won't stop him. Favorites include Tangled Up in Blue, Simple Twist of Fate, You're a Big Girl Now, Idiot Wind, You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go, Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts, Shelter from the Storm, and Buckets of Rain. Highly Recommended.
B000059TEQ|4.0|This 1970's Classic is the best love story i have seen. Anybody who has seen this movie can totally relate to these characters in some form. They fall in love and cross social barriers and marry and face the biggest crisis of thier lives. this film has a common theme which is \\"Love does conquer all\\".
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Joe Strummer never got to see this album come out. His death was unbearable for all Clash and Punk fans alike. It is a good thing this came out to give us some great music and some of Joe's best songs. The cover of Bob Marley's Redemption Song is beautifully produced by Rick Rubin, which was originally a duet with Johnny Cash. Here to me it has more meaning. Get Down Moses is a classic song which brings back moments of The Clash. Favorites include Coma Girl, Get Down Moses, Long Shadow, Ramshackle Day Parade, Redemption Song, Burnin' Streets, Midnight Jam, and Silver and Gold. Highly Highly Recommended. R.I.P. Joe Strummer. LONG LIVE THE CLASH!!!!!

0553579908|5.0|I think I liked the first one slightly more, since there were fewer characters to move from and the wait between finding out what happened to each one was not quite so long, yet, regardless, this was still a superb work of fiction.  I find myself completely wrapped up in the lives of these people.  I find myself cheering for the most unlikely characters and feeling sorry for some of the more wicked ones.  These are definitely multi-dementional characters and the skill in which Martin shows them to the reader is amazing.  I can't wait to get my hands on the the third and fourth of this series.

B000001DYY|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's of all time, a really alternative album.  Don't mind that the lyrics dont make sense, or that Rolland is talking in riddles, it just sounds great!  These songs are just so catchy, yet Elemental is much different from other TFF albums.  The Seeds Of Love was a lot more lush, Songs From The Big Chair was VERY commercial and soulful, yet I like Elemental because it's edgier, more alternative, very well crafted, dark, and moody.  This CD made me a TRUE fan of Tears For Fears and although I doubt they will ever follow this up again (I can play Elemental and never grow tired of it).  This CD was a true college gem of the 90's and not at all a CD from an 80's band trying to make a desperate comeback.  Rolland gave an interview right after this came out and said \\"It's just like I's starting over again\\" speaking of the CD, the Elemental Tour, and recapturing the fans (especially in the college circuits) which this CD was a big hit.  The album only went Gold but it wasnt expected to sell much at all.  Tears For Fears was expected to become another fallen supergroup from the 80's that enjoyed a moment in the limelight.  No TFF releases have come close to this since, although there have been some very good select tracks from various CDs.  Sadly enough, even the new CD Everybody Loves A Happy Ending with both Rolland and Curt back together again is not even close to the greatness of Elemental (although reading the reviews on Amazon, Tears For Fears fans seem to like it well enough).  But in my opinion, if you want the best buy, in this order  1)Elemental, 2) Songs From the Big Chair,  3) The Seeds Of Love.

0385495323|5.0|A book with yellowish pages, matching cover, and the title \\"The Code Book\\" makes a very appealing strong statement, at least to me!<br /><br />The book presents cryptography to the general public. It may also help specialists interested to know the history behind some of the material they have studied or teaching in cryptography.<br /><br />I felt, when holding this book for the first time that it will provide me with an interesting and a wholesome story behind this intriguing subject. Well, I was right, it did.<br /><br />The author, Simon Singh an avid story teller, has succeeded in bringing the \\"What, Who, How and Why\\" all together in an interesting and enlightening manner. The book consists of eight chapters comprising more than 400 pages with an easy-to-read language. It covers data communication security techniques from the first known methods of scrambling messages (Cryptography) and message hiding techniques (Steganography) to the current state-of-the-art \\"Quantum Cryptography\\".<br /><br />The book contains a large number of figures, tables and pictures of the people involved in coding and code breaking. It presents the tale of communication security by means of very fascinating and enlightening examples and historical facts.
B000006045|4.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before? Very little I suppose, but let me throw my two cents in.<br /><br />This is a trip-hop classic. It is slow electronic music over heavy hip-hop beats adorned by incredibly luscious sexy female vocals (and the occasional male vocals). The music is slow, dark, accompanied by heavy beats and perfectly well-timed scratchings. Some guitars on ocassion help to give the overall dark feel of the album.<br /><br />Truly a very unique album that trip-hop fans will enjoy, and a perfect introduction for newcomers to the genre. Fresh till this day. But beware, it is a very deep and complex album that may take a few listens before truly enjoying all its depth.<br /><br />Think of it as the soundtrack of a thriller movie in the order of a \\"silence of the lambs\\" or \\"kiss the girls\\". That might help you get an idea of the kind of music I'm talking about. It is sexy and classy, but it is also paranoid and schizophrenic.<br /><br />Three words for you: Excellent but Dark.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I had a hard time sitting through this to the end.  Utterly uninteresting.  The lives of four miserable people, incapable of finding happiness, with lots of x-rated dialog thrown in.  Clive Owen and Jude Law certainly can act, but who really wants to sit through all this?
B00005221M|5.0|I will have to admit; this is one of the films I have seen over and over.  I was fascintated by the earlier version (1936 and there was even a much earlier version) so of course I had to see Michael Mann's film.  I was not disappointed.  Daniel Day-Lewis was credible as Hawkeye  and the vivacious Madeleine Stowe had the right chemisty to make this a wonderful, romantic journey during the late 1800's on the frontier-East Coast of the U.S.  This was in fact, even considering the constant violence, indeed a fine love story, actually it was two love stories, rolled into one spectacular production.  I don't recommend this for young children as the violence, while necessary since there was a war going on, is a bit too much at times.  Watch Magua (Wes Studi) he is great as the vindictive protagonist.  Outstanding cast and cinematography by Douglas Milsome was magnificant.<br /><br />I loved this film and Ms Stowe, is to me, one of the more beautiful women on the planet.  Thanks to James Fenmore Cooper's \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" Uncas and Chingachgook are names I will never forget.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan is the greatest band to ever play music. With songs like \\"Shut up!\\" and \\"Welcome to my life\\", they show their musical growth and overall domination over other contemporary artists like Good Charlotte and Justin Guarini.  <br /> <br />Some may feel that because their main audience is 11-year-old girls that they aren't good. On the contrary, who is to say 11-year-old girls don't have good taste in music.  I see many going to their local Walmart to purchase \\"Now! Volume 193\\". That is a quality CD with many amazing artists.  <br /> <br />If you have yet to get into Simple Plan, here are two reasons why you should: the lead singer is Canadian and has bleached hair. As many frat guys know, bleaching your hair is hard to do.  Hopefully he didn't spill his Kokanee while trying to do it.  <br /> <br />To all Simple Plan haters: Stop Canuck-hating. You know the best when you hear it. Welcome to my life everybody, I am a Simple Plan fan!
B0000028VT|5.0|After marrying sony label honcho in June 1993 (the famous doomed marriage) Mariah recorded her third studio album music box probably her best known album which would go on to sell over 23 million copies world wide and would include some of Mariah's signature songs such as HERO, DREAMLOVER, ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND and the cover of Harry Neilsons WITHOUT YOU.  <br /> <br />DREAMLOVER is a very summery style song clearly influenced my Minnie Rippertons loving you and has a brilliant video and the lyrics of the song speak for millions. HERO could very well be the most famous Mariah Carey song ever a simple ballad about making it through tough times there's just something about it that makes it so wonderful. ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND is a very gospel sounding song the backup singers (the Price sisters etc) really shine here it's a crime that this great song never got to number one on the billboard hot 100. The next song has the title of the album MUSIC BOX is good and it kind of grows on you  but its perhaps too long for a song which is very slow paced and can drag a bit by the end. NOW THAT I KNOW is a very dancy pop song with a very early 1990s sound to it because of this it can sound a bit dated today but is still an enjoyable Carey, Clivilles and Cole produced song.  <br /> <br />Next up is NEVER FORGET YOU the Kenny (Baby face) Edmonds produced track of music box im not sure but I think this is about not telling someone who has died how much she loved him its nice but not an album highlight for me. After this comes WITHOUT YOU this is one of only 2 Mariah songs (the other being against all odds a duet with westlife for the rainbow album) to go number 1 in the UK it beats the original hands down all because of her superior vocals. Tracks eight, nine and ten are 2 ballads and another up tempo track similar to NOW THAT I KNOW these are names JUST TO HOLD YOU ONCE AGIN,IVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU,AND ALL IVE EVER WANTED these are all good songs for towards the end ofthe album but far from the classics such as DREAMLOVER or HERO. Then finally since im from the UK there is a bonus track EVERYTHING FADES AWAY this is a cool way to end the album it seems strangely up-tempo for a ballad and has some male vocals in the middle. <br /> <br />This is a really cool album and it's perfectly understandable why this is her biggest selling this will appeal to those who prefer the ballads apposed to the up-tempo tracks though I personally prefer her more up-tempo hits such as fantasy and honey people in general seemed to like the old Mariah better this is only just beginning to change with this years Mariah release The Emancipation Of Mimi however Music Box will probably always be the biggest selling Mariah album.      <br />
0385335482|5.0|Imagine being a London career girl living in a chic neighborhood, having fabulous friends, dating the most eligible bachelors, and all you can worry about is avoiding the creditors that are stalking you.  This is hilarious - yet also a cautionary tale.  I recognized the thrill of the hunt, the joy of the actual sale, fantasizing glamorous scenarios to justify your purchases, and the satisfaction of carrying home armfuls of glossy bags from upscale shops...  Its impossible not to love Becky, its impossible not to relate to her love of pretty things, its also impossible not to be glad it isn't us in so much debt.  If you tend to shop too much when you get a little down about something, read this book instead.  It cured me, and did the same for a shopaholic friend of mine.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|I just watched this movie today after a friend had told me how fascinating it was. It was just that. The film deals with several characters who are dealing with drug addictions. Jared Leto plays as Harry. His girlfriend Marion is played by Jennifer Connely. His best friend Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans. And his mother Sara is played by Ellen Burstyn. Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are pretty much heroin addicts. Sara is an older woman who feels alone, and one day she gets a call that tells her she is going to be on television. Her t.v. is really all she has, and she becomes obsessed with losing weight to look good on tv so she will feel special and so people will like her. She even starts taking these pills that a doctor prescribed that are uppers. She becomes addicted to them and she slowly is slipping. I have never been exposed to people doing hardcore drugs. I've been with some friends while they were smoking pot or something. I've never seen any of them do heroin or anything like that, so this movie was a shock to me. My hands were shaking after this movie, and I was so upset over what ends up happening to Sara, that I almost broke down.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie. It is very thought provoking and artistic.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|Oh Bridget!  You are an absolutely loveable mess.  I watched this movie in both Spanish and English, its just as funny in either language. The wicked Daniel Cleaver is scrummy as ever - but a little easier to resist this time around - since we know he can never truly mend his bad boy ways.  Darcy is the hero every girl dreams of - and yes he is still infuriatingly reserved.  Follow Bridget's wacky adventures and don't miss out on the DVD's deleted scenes.

0385338686|4.0|What happens when a hotshot London lawyer from a workaholic family of overachievers suffers a cruel twist of fate and finds herself working as a maid in the country?  Like SK's other famous character Becky Bloomwood, our heroine Samantha Sweeting finds herself in one pickle after another.  I honestly couldn't put this book down - for two reasons: I was a workaholic Washington lawyer who recently left it all behind for a simpler life in Florida (no I am not a maid).  The other reason was laughing myself silly as one lie after another escalated into the inevitable train wreck.  The book builds up to a climax, has a little twist, then there is yet another climax.  In true ChickLit fashion, the endings are predictable - but you had so much fun with our heroine, you don't care.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|After a full blown metal album in 2003, DREAM THEATER are back to their more progressive roots, with a vendetta. While \\"Train of Thought\\" didn't do much with the latter of the \\"heavy, melodic and progressive\\" triplet on which the band takes pride to be associated with, \\"Octavarium\\" is again a big melting pot, much like most of the band's previous efforts. The interesting twist is that even though the influence of classical progressive outfits is ever present, this time we see many traits of much more recent and, some would say, surprising bands. You don't need to pay a lot of attention to the music within this record to instantly recognize, of all bands, a big MUSE influence. The truth is that if you have been following this band lately, it turns out not be that much of a surprise. The more creative members seem to be attracted to Muse lately and, if you ask me, it could be much worse. It's actually a good thing, and being influenced by a contemporary and active band shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />\\"Octavarium\\" is also another Dream Theater's stab at creating a concept piece, even if this one is a little unusual in that and not in the same sense as their own \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" or other classic concept albums like PINK FLOYD's \\"The Wall\\" or QUEENSRYCHE's \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\". This time, the concept is not in terms of storyline but in everything that surrounds the album, all the way down to the artwork and the booklet. I don't want to spoil anything for whoever is reading this and is yet to get their copy, but it shouldn't take much to actually get it when you have the thing in your hands and the disc in your player. And while we're talking about the artwork, this album would honestly warrant 5 stars, if only for it. Hugh Syme (who has worked with MEGADETH, RUSH, QUEENSRYCHE in the past and more recently did NEVERMORE's \\"This Godless Endeavor\\") has done an outstanding job working under Mike Portnoy's concept and the booklet is nothing short of remarkable, yet simple and soothing.<br /><br />And on to the music...<br /><br />The album opens with the continuation of the on-going alcoholism saga which is being written by Portnoy, one piece per album, since 2002's \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\". \\"The Root of All Evil\\" starts ominously, with interesting samples which have been used to this effect for the first time in the band's work. And immediately die-hard fans will notice the back references to the previous songs in this series, namely to \\"This Dying Soul\\" which are in fact sprinkled throughout the song. It soon shifts into high gear and for all we know, this could be a continuation of \\"Train of Thought\\". The lyrics are very heartfelt and go straight to the point (\\"Never could have just a part of it\\"/\\"I always need more to get by\\" and \\"Lazy enough to sleep all day\\"/\\"And let my life just waste away\\"). This is a very hard rocker with instant hooks and it's definitely a great way to kickstart the album. It sure will be interesting to follow this saga onto its conclusion over the next couple of albums and to the expected live rendition in its entirety.<br /><br />After the storm comes the calmness and so \\"The Root of All Evil\\" sweetly segues into the beautiful \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" which strongly nods to \\"Anna Lee\\" back in the \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" album. James LaBrie is quietly stunning in this track and, dare I say it, this is where he shines the most. His work with Arjen Lucassen on the latest AYREON album is proof of that. The mood keeps going back and forth and \\"These Walls\\" is another heavy tune and arguably one of the best tracks and that's because every member of the band really is at his best. Take the section from 04:38 to 05:08 where Petrucci does a really nice, simple and moody solo aswell as Portnoy's remarkable drum work which then goes into the buildup to the chorus from 05:08 to 05:23. This is where Rudess shines, albeit not on a technical point of view, and the same is true for the song's outro whichleads to the next track, \\"I Walk Beside You\\". This song actually puzzles me because DREAM THEATER has never been a band seeking much mainstream exposure but this track reeks of that. Apart from a strong nod to U2 (imagine that!) and interesting drum work during the intro, this song doesn't really have much to recommend it and clearly doesn't fit the whole. While it's not a bad song per se, it really is the album's weakest link.<br /><br />The second part of the album opens with a shredding badass bass solo by John Myung, which instantly makes you think of similar stuff in \\"Metropolis Pt.1\\" and \\"The Dance of Eternity\\". The song is powerful and it deals with... well you guessed it, panic attacks. It's interesting to see how all of the panic attack symptoms are illustrated in this song, lyrically and musically. While this could certainly be a part of \\"Train of Thought\\" aswell, the middle section features some nice soloing and instrumental show-off which is used very sparingly in this latest offering, unlike the previous work by the band. It's also where the MUSE influence is more clear especially in the way LaBrie sings the chorus. \\"Never Enough\\" is another one of the album's best tracks and again Portnoy gets pretty much to the point with his lyrics, dealing with those fans who don't know how to appreciate his hard work for the band and simply can't get enough. The lyrics can even be tough to follow, so crude, graphical and agressive (yet beautiful) they are (\\"Cut myself open wide\\"/\\"Reach inside\\"/\\"Help yourself to all I have to give\\" or \\"Sacrifice my life\\"/\\"Neglect my kids and wife\\"/\\"All for you to be happy\\"). \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" brings the 9/11 subject back to light and displays LaBrie's contribution to the lyrics department (along with part of the last song). This is what could be called a \\"half-epic\\" and features one of the best instrumental sections of the whole album. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Finally, there's the epic title track which clocks in at a whooping 24:00. And the truth is that it doesn't fall short of \\"A Change of Seasons\\" or \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\". It is indeed one of the best things the band has ever done, even if the lyrics are very obscure and confusing at times which was not really the case of the previous epics. I must confess that during the first few minutes I was confused and not sure if my copy had PINK FLOYD's \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" as the last song instead, but that was just for a couple of seconds there. Jordan Rudess introduces the use of the steel lap guitar (one of a few technical innovations for the band on this record) to great effect which helps on this song sounding like one giant tribute to a lot of the classic progressive bands like YES and ELP. I prefer not to go into much detail on this song because this is something to be experienced and discovered and I don't want to spoil it for anyone who is yet to do so. Suffice to say it is very very good and on par with the best output of the band.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Octavarium\\" is a strong album but as always with this band it is very difficult to compare it with the rest of the catalogue. Despite some really heavy tunes, fans of DT's more progressive side will be happier than those on the metal camp, to whom \\"Train of Thought\\" was probably the best offering. It may be the best effort since \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" but then again it's not as cohesive and coherent as most of the other albums. For that and for the radio-friendly nods, I don't give it five stars but it really is a 4,5 rating. It will be interesting to see where DREAM THEATER goes from here. It really will be.ro which leads to the next track, \\"I Walk Beside You\\".

B0007OASII|5.0|In one word: GREAT!. If we could call this album \\"Epica II\\" as the style from the previous album continues here, and that is probably what makes this album great. Kamelot keeps evolving his musical style without loosing what they have already accomplished by including more diverse sound this time, but keeping a melodic and sophisticated sound.

I remember seeing Chicago a couple of months before this album was recorded. I guess you will notice how Saturday in the Park was never introduced. They performed it that way the night I saw them and for weeks I told my friends that they  played a new song that night that was awesome.  <br />When they asked me what was the title...I said something like ..The 4th of July..Duhhh..

B00001OH7O|5.0|Hunky Dory by David Bowie is easily the best lyricly written album of all time! Long concedered Bowie's best album next to, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars. Released in 1971, just before Ziggy, and right after the hard rocking, The Man Who Sold The World. As metioned The Man Who Sold The World is a hard rock album, with heavy piledriving guitars by Mick Ronson. Where as The Man Who Sold The World was a rare album in Bowie cannon, so is Hunky Dory. This is an almost all acoustic guitar album, and mainly a pianon fueled effort. To me David Bowie never before or since wrote better songs then he did here, the lyrics are nothing short of amazing! Bowie vocals shine through beautifuly. Mick Ronson's acoustic guitar work still amazes as well as his great arrangements. A real treat is the feature yes keyboardist Rick Wakemen's piano playing.<br /><br />Hunky Dory opens with the all time Bowie classic, 'Changes' which for most people is the first Bowie song that people ever heard. Though the song was not a hit it still to this day is played on the radio and is concedered a classic among classics! 'Oh, You Pretty Things' is one of the best songs on the album, with a nice catchy chorus and a great rythmicly sung verse that sounds really cool. I think Bowie wrote this song about himself. 'Eight Line Poem' is exactly what its called, the poem really doesnt make since but the guitar intro by Mick Ronson is absolutly stunning. 'Life On Mars' is one of David Bowie's all time best songs. Featuring one of his all time best chorus' and lyrics, it's really a shining moment in music history. 'Kooks' is a cheesey song about his daughter I think, it's really catchy. The next song contains some of the best lyrics ever written by anyone, 'Quicksand' is just down right amazing, and fantastic, and any other good word you could use to describe it. 'Fill Your Heart' is a cover song, that I dont really like to much, I mean its ok every once in a while but it's deffinatly not one of my favorite songs on the album. I love 'Andy Warhol' this song has one of the coolest chorus' ever. The songs lyrics are really great, and this song also features one of the all time best guitar riffs, Mick Ronson never fails to amaze me. Also the intro to this song where Bowie tells the guy in the soundboard how to say Warhol. 'A Song For Bob Dylan' is another cool song and it's about.... you guessed it Bob Dylan. 'Queen Bitch' was really a sign of things to come, it is straight up glam-rock, before there was even glam-rock proven that once again David Bowie is and always has been ahead of his time, the damn genius! The album closes with the epic 'The Bewlay Brothers' which is a long acoustic jam with great lyrics and amazing vocals by Bowie.

0140042520|5.0|THE DHARMA BUMS is Kerouac's mostly autobiographical 1958 follow-up to the iconic ON THE ROAD. And, truth be known, THE DHARMA BUMS, though less known, is a far better tale than its predecessor, which embraced a rough and gritty depravity as the Beat metier.<br /><br />In THE DHARMA BUMS, Ray Smith (Kerouac) sets out for California where he meets Japhy Ryder (the poet Gary Snyder), who introduces him to the essences of Zen Buddhism, as well as the core of what was to become the counterculture of the 1960s.<br /><br />Kerouac's gentle, wide-eyed amazement at the spiritual world he has entered is manifest on every page. Whether in a North Frisco crash pad or in the Sierras, Kerouac moves through a joyous universe full of light, color, and sheer new-ness. His ability to share his inner visions on these pages marks him as a truly talented writer. THE DHARMA BUMS is a happy book. Even Kerouac's occasional bouts with alcohol and depression do not detract from the experience, they merely underscore the happiness and the heights to be found in Zen spiritual practice.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this book, and I really do. For anyone who cares to make the journey, THE DHARMA BUMS is a great (if unfocused) primer on Zen that needs to be read for the simple pleasure of it.
B0000009W6|5.0|Hunky Dory by David Bowie is easily the best lyricly written album of all time! Long concedered Bowie's best album next to, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars. Released in 1971, just before Ziggy, and right after the hard rocking, The Man Who Sold The World. As metioned The Man Who Sold The World is a hard rock album, with heavy piledriving guitars by Mick Ronson. Where as The Man Who Sold The World was a rare album in Bowie cannon, so is Hunky Dory. This is an almost all acoustic guitar album, and mainly a pianon fueled effort. To me David Bowie never before or since wrote better songs then he did here, the lyrics are nothing short of amazing! Bowie vocals shine through beautifuly. Mick Ronson's acoustic guitar work still amazes as well as his great arrangements. A real treat is the feature yes keyboardist Rick Wakemen's piano playing.<br /><br />Hunky Dory opens with the all time Bowie classic, 'Changes' which for most people is the first Bowie song that people ever heard. Though the song was not a hit it still to this day is played on the radio and is concedered a classic among classics! 'Oh, You Pretty Things' is one of the best songs on the album, with a nice catchy chorus and a great rythmicly sung verse that sounds really cool. I think Bowie wrote this song about himself. 'Eight Line Poem' is exactly what its called, the poem really doesnt make since but the guitar intro by Mick Ronson is absolutly stunning. 'Life On Mars' is one of David Bowie's all time best songs. Featuring one of his all time best chorus' and lyrics, it's really a shining moment in music history. 'Kooks' is a cheesey song about his daughter I think, it's really catchy. The next song contains some of the best lyrics ever written by anyone, 'Quicksand' is just down right amazing, and fantastic, and any other good word you could use to describe it. 'Fill Your Heart' is a cover song, that I dont really like to much, I mean its ok every once in a while but it's deffinatly not one of my favorite songs on the album. I love 'Andy Warhol' this song has one of the coolest chorus' ever. The songs lyrics are really great, and this song also features one of the all time best guitar riffs, Mick Ronson never fails to amaze me.

B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|Whereas the Seven Pillars of Wisdom was only partially true, this film uses that book as a basis for a pretty coherent script by Robert Bolt.  David Lean breathed life into it with cinematography to rival most directors and a new star he found, Peter O Toole.  This film is a classic and wonderfully made though certain elements are probably very innaccurate.  There are no women in this film worth speaking of and a great deal of Lawrence's formative years are left out.  The film also ends pretty abruptly.  A breathtaking film from start to finish with a great deal of sensitivity to the original material, perhaps now a touch dated and patronising - but the Oscars speak for themselves.

B00005Q66T|5.0|All of the tracks that make up GHV2 were hits by Madonna, and all of them are worthy of being here; however the only problem with this collection is that it feels incomplete because she released a collection of ballads in 1995 (Something to Remember), and in doing so decided to exclude certain songs from future collections. (This Used to be My Playground, Rain, I'll Remember, and You'll See, which was a hit single off of Something to Remember.) She also excluded her two successful cover tracks, (Fever and American Pie) both of which were successful dance tracks and charted very well. The other difference for this collection as opposed to her first collection (Immaculate) is that none of the tracks are remixed. If you listen to Immaculate Collection many of the tracks were edited and remixed into different more current sounding versions that were unique to that album, on GHV2 all of the tracks are either radio/single edit versions or albums versions which had all been previously released. Then of course there is the whole issue of no new tracks being included on the album. This is a bit dissapointing because it makes the album seem in a way dull. The cover of the album is great, but again it was a photo we had already seen from her recent tour; in fact all of the photographs shown in the artwork were all images that had been previously seen. GHV2 was a dissapointing release at the time because it didnt have any new tracks, no new pictures, versions of the songs previously released, and what felt like several tracks missing from the setlist.  <br /> <br />All of this being said, I still gave the album 5 stars, because the music included on this album is still timeless great music that blows away any other artist's second greatest hits collection. <br /> <br />Erotica, Deeper and Deeper - From the dark sexually driven EROTICA album, the selections are raunchy, revealing dance numbers that are both catchy and sexy. My only tiff is that more selections from EROTICA should have been included on this collection. <br /> <br />Secret, Take a Bow, Bedtime Story, Human Nature - From the r&b inspired BEDTIME STORIES, the selections are incredibly diverse and show Madonna's versatility. Secret and Take a Bow are passionate and soulful, while Bedtime Story and Human Nature are inventive and bold. <br /> <br />Don't Cry for Me Argentina - From the EVITA soundtrack, the selection seems a bit out of place on this collection, however it is beautifully sung and certainly represents a milestone in Madonna's career. <br /> <br />Frozen, Ray of Light, Drowned World, The Power of Good-bye - From the most critically acclaimed album of Madonna's career, RAY OF LIGHT, the selections marked the rebirth of Madonna as a mother and a spiritual being. Each of the tracks are very revealing and deeply personal, and contain some of her most ambitious vocal achievements. <br /> <br />Beautiful Stranger - From the AUSTIN POWERS 2 soundtrack, the selection is fun, bouncy and was a great summer radio track. <br /> <br />Music, Don't Tell Me, What it Feels Like for a Girl - From her hit-crazed MUSIC album, the selections are only a testament that Madonna only gets better with age; the tracks are able to stand up on the pop charts, while still maintaining artistic integrity. <br /> <br />Something I must also mention about GHV2 is that unlike most artists, some of Madonna's best tracks are those that she doesn't release from the albums as singles. These album only tracks were never hits because they weren't released and can not be included on this album. As Madonna has grown from the pop music that was her Immaculate Collection, some of her biggest hits have been ones the vast number of people haven't heard.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|This is a no-brainer. The Stooges are the greatest American band of all time. The Asheton/Alexander rhythm section is in the same league as Jackson/Dunn, Ron Asheton is a walkin' talkin' GOD and Iggy is the complete frontman package. And his lyrics are genius.  <br />The Beatles suck. And The Stones. And everyone else too. Why bother to make music when The Stooges said it all. Sell your instruments now. There is no point in continuing.
B000002LJW|5.0|This is one of my favorite Eric Clapton albums.  It is difficult to choose highlights, as everything on here is great, but certainly numbers 2 and 3 number among the best tracks I've heard in any genre.  A must for any fan of Clapton, and a good intro to some of his later stuff for the un-initiated.

0142000663|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath was an obligatory read but the book enthralled me. Despite many boring passages, I found that it supported many needed moral values such as hard working and kindness to others. The book sent forth a very Christian message despite unorthodox \\"teachings\\" from the Reverend Jim Casey (J.C.) whose initials he shares with Jesus Christ. Many say this book has Communist insinuations. It may seem this way and I would say so too if the Californian landholders where not intentionally kicking the already weak migrants back into the dirt. This book does deserve the title of Classic and ranks high up there. This is must read book.
B000065U1N|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie.  There were a few parts where the wording was a little predictable but the effects and actions during wartime were well done. <br /> <br />Quick Summary: <br />1993, members of the US Rangers, Delta Forces, (I believe) the 101st Mountain armored division, and the (I think) 76th Tactical Support wing (BHs and 'Little Birds') were sent to the war-torn streets of Mogadishu, Somalia to capture several of General Adide's aides.  What seemed to be a perfectly planned mission went horribly wrong... two Black Hawks were shot down and several HMMVVs seriously damaged, all covered with American blood. <br /> <br />This is a quick review so I had to summarize the movie but it's more than what I said above.   <br /> <br />Mistakes with the operation: <br />- US and UN military forces underestimated Somalian firepower (AK-47s and RPGs) <br />- Spectre Gunships were not provided by Washington <br />- CAS was unavailable after the BHs went down leaving many battle-hardened Rangers and members of Delta stranded on the ground being fired upon from all sides <br /> <br />One small note: If you think we should or shouldn't have gone into Somalia, that's your opinion.  What bugs the **** out of me is that people hate the military personnel that went there.  I've read online articles made about that mission and people actually say they hate the US forces that were there... what the ****!  Those men died for what they believed was right.  Whether you supported the war or not is your opinion, but you better **** well support those troops that fought and died for that belief of theirs they held so close to their hearts. <br /> <br />If you saw the movie, you will see that two Rangers went down to set up a perimeter around the second downed BH alone VOLUNTARILY.  They killed twenty or thirty Somalis (maybe more) before they were killed protecting Michael Durant who was released shortly after the conflict.  They knew they wouldn't hold out until the Humvee column arrived.  If that isn't true herosim, then I don't know what is...
B000053VAZ|5.0|I've been a fan of Mary Stuart Masterson ever since I saw Some Kind of Wonderful, and Johnny Depp plays the kind of quirky characters I usually like, but something had kept me away from Benny & Joon all this time.  Partly, it was the fact that I caught a few minutes of the movie on TV and saw Depp doing a whole vaudeville routine that smacked a little too much of mimes - like every sane person in the world, I detest mimes.  At last, though, I have seen the film and I can declare it a wonderful motion picture - quirky, most certainly, but good and exceedingly human.  It does stretch the theme of love conquers all just a bit, but who cares?<br /><br />Mary Stuart Masterson plays Joon, a young woman with a mental illness that is never clearly delineated - she's been known to start little fires, she sometimes hears voices in her head, and there is a somewhat childlike character to her nature.  Aidan Quinn plays her brother Benny, a truly good guy who puts his sister's needs ahead of his own - even if it means turning down dinner with a hot chick.  The siblings are approaching a crossroads, though - Joon has just run off another housekeeper, Benny can't find anyone to stay with her during the day, and all the while Joon's doctor is urging Benny to put her in a group home.  Then Sam (Johnny Depp) arrives, after Joon wins him in a poker game - he's one of Benny's buddy's cousins, and he's driving the guy crazy.  Benny takes him home temporarily, and things soon begin to change around the house.<br /><br />Sam is even weirder than Joon (he makes grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron, for example), so naturally the two hit it off quite well.  He has his own problems, but his quirky ways and Buster Keaton-inspired antics quickly win over Benny and most especially Joon.  Benny even starts seeing a local girl named Ruthie (Julianne Moore), whom Sam immediately recognized as a B-movie actress from a few years past.  Then, of course, romantic love rears its ugly head, and things go south in a hurry for everyone concerned, pushing Joon into a serious episode that shows Sam just how sick she really is.<br /><br />Aidan Quinn is quite good in his role of Benny (and Julianne Moore is a nice bonus for the film), but Depp and Masterson clearly carry the story with their characters' quirky antics and heart-warming commitment to one another.  As I alluded to, I'm not a fan of the whole Buster Keaton comedy shtick, but Depp proves a master at it, and he and Masterson have a real chemistry between them.  There's high drama alongside a fair amount of subdued comedy, but Benny & Joon is an unashamedly feel-good movie, quite predictable yet charming and touching - and blessed with an extremely talented cast.ings go south in a hurry for everyone concerned, pushing Joon into a serious episode that shows Sam just how sick she really is.   <br /> <br />Aidan Quinn is quite good in his role of Benny (and Julianne Moore is a nice bonus for the film), but Depp and Masterson clearly carry the story with their characters' quirky antics and heart-warming commitment to one another.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I won't go into too much detail of the episodes as people have already described them but I will say that the series of episodes was done remarkably well. <br /> <br />It tells of the soldier's life during wartime and how they had to rely on each other to get by every day of bitter fighting. <br /> <br />Overall a great series of episodes retelling the remarkable events that Easy company faced during WWII.

0151008116|5.0|I found this book to be enlightening and pleasurable in both its sense of adventure and its quiet acceptance of spiritual truth among religious faiths.  The narration (switching from interviewers to interviewee) gave the tale depth and believability, completeting a tale of both heroics and compassion.  In the end, the book club section asks if it is a tale of tragedy, romance, or comedy.  I say it is a tale of love, in all its many complicated and querky facets.
0316172324|1.0|For all of you readers who think that Blink will be as good as The Tipping Point, you are sadly mistaken.  Sure, this book has fun ideas, but it also has no real point, no real insight, and offers you nothing to take away.  I think this book is very much like Psych 101, you finally have a name to put to things you already know about, and can do nothing with the information but forget it.  I would like to recommend that you simply re-read The Tipping Point.   <br />
B000068OSK|5.0|It is significant that people have returned in 2005 to review or register their views on this album. The White Stripes have slowly but surely/inevitably been recognised for the phenomenon they are. This album is where it started, and for the benefit of this review they have yet to top it. <br /> <br />I personally believe the Stripes can do no wrong, i have every album and everything else of there's i can possibly afford/get my hands on, i'd like to think i know what i'm talking about. Ok, there is no such thing as a bad or maybe even mediocre White Stripes song let alone album, but this album has probably 8 of their best songs on it. This is the best that lo-fi and maybe therefore music can get, if you admire the raw energy and bare-bones beauty of one man and a guitar then the sooner you buy this the better. <br /> <br />The other reviewers will tell you all of the influences that Jack White has drawn upon to create a sound that is definitively The White Stripes' own but the blues man Son House is responsible for the genius of the latter part of 'Cannon' whilst the credit for including it and building upon it is Jack White's alone, and is symbolic of the Stripes full stop. This is raw, foot tapping, head nodding, non sensical brilliance.  <br /> <br />A previous reviewer from Detroit (the Stripes' city of birth) mentioned the 'Detroitness' of their sound that is writ large on tracks like 'The Big Three killed my baby' (a reference to the big three car companies that apparently carjacked Detroit's home industry) and 'Broken bricks' (which refers to the subsequent recession and abandonment of the city by the big three). I'm from London, and i feel like i know what he's talking about simply through the magnificance of these songs. Incidentally 'Broken Bricks' is THE best song these two modern day heroes have written. <br /> <br />Songs like 'Wasting My Time' and 'Do' are the most resonant songs i have ever heard as a twenty something bloke who has tasted love and socail awkwardness, i defy any man to not connect in the most amazing way to these songs. <br /> <br />Concurrently, on the whole the raucous, distorted or otherwise guitar does the talking alongside Jack White's strained but controlled voice on songs like 'Cannon', 'Astro' and 'When i hear my name' which are impossible to not move to. <br /> <br />'Screwdriver' deserves special mention, not just because it's the longest track (at 3.14...) but because of it's stop-start, story telling anarchic, soulful axe-wielding. <br /> <br />The lyrics are fantastically simple where they make sense and where they dont you just dont care... you're too busy marvelling at the guitar or improvising a mug as a high hat. <br /> <br />I'll conclude an already extensive review (in which i'm aware i've missed out half the fantastic tracks on this record, but my words cannot possibly do them justice) with six words. <br /> <br />Raw, soulful, inspired, phenomenal(truly, in the literal sense), tireless, essential.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I'll confess that this could be a slightly biased review.  I love Ryan Adams.  I'm a huge fan and it was inevitable that I was going to rate this album five stars.  I'm not going to pretend that I just picked this album up randomly and I was amazed.  As soon as I heard about the release of 'Cold Roses' I was counting the days to its release, and I was NOT disappointed.<br />Ryan has a very loyal fan base, made up of people who are fans of real music.  They may all be fans, but there's a reason they are and this album is one of those reasons.  'Cold Roses' is another stellar effort from one of music's most amazing, talented, prolific songwriters to date.  He might be crazy, he might be erratic, but he's one of very few people left in this crazy world who actually SUFFER for their ART (and it IS art for once, none of this manufactered, mass-produced machine &quot;artists&quot; who sing for the big bucks).  There are quite a few standout tracks on this album; Magnolia Mountain, Friends, Cold Roses, Let It Ride, Meadowlake Street, Beautiful Sorta, How Do You Keep Love Alive - that all prove to the world that Ryan is a real, true, bonified singer/songwriter with so much to give.  He might be feisty and deeply sensative, but it WORKS.  I LOVE Ryan Adams.  And I think everyone, for better or for worse, should hear this album.  It's a real gem.
B000001FDQ|5.0|Yngwie J. Malmsteen, the Godfather of Shred, broke out onto the music scene at the age of 19 on this landmark 1984 release.  The music world would never be the same.  For those not familiar with the guitarist, he is the one of the greatest guitarists that ever lived.  Forget about Hendrix, Paige, Vai, Satrianni...even John Petrucci.  Yngwie has all these guys beat.  Tracing roots in rock music centered around Deep Purple, Rainbow, and probably Randy Rhoads and Eddie Van Halen as well, Malmsteen took the art of playing fast and used it in a way that it did not grow old.  Critics say Yngwie just plays fast and has no feeling, but half of those people are jealous and the other half don't really listen to the music. <br /> <br />Malmsteen does almost all the writing on this record, but still has a decent band to play with.  Most notable is the future founder of the band Stratovarius, keyboardist, Jens Johansson.  Jeff Scott Soto is on vocals, but I prefer some of Ygnwie's later vocalists instead, such as Joe Lynn Turner and Mark Boals.  On this debut release, Yngwie sounds like he's been playing guitar for 30 years, even though he had only been alive for 19.  I listen to other shred guitarists who can play extremely fast, yet the solos get stale and bland after the second or third solo you hear.  On the other hand, with Mr. Malmsteen, he shows a deep understanding of music theory and guitar technique.  There is originality and spontanaeity in his style of soloing and he also delivers the emotion and feeling that so many of his critics say he lacks. <br /> <br />The first two tracks on this album, 'Black Star,' and 'Far Beyond the Sun' showcase his amazing style, and would quickly become two of the most practiced and analyzed pieces for up-and-coming shred guitarists all around the world.  Even today, the score and tablature for these two songs appear in all sorts of guitar magazines and practice guides.  'Black Star' starts with a beautiful classical guitar intro and grows into a structured instrumental with the same two-note bass line throughout most of the song with Malmsteen soloing over it.  This track does a great job of showing the emotional intensity of this guitar 'God'.  'Far Beyong the Sun' is my personal favorite of the two - the main riff must have around 25 notes in it and lasts all of four seconds! It is much faster than 'Black Star' and shows the listener the versatility in Malmsteen's neo-classical playing.  Even though there are no lyrics, you will find yourself singing the guitar part to yourself all day long. <br /> <br />Another great instrumental is 'Little Savage' - Yngwie uses a dirty, muddy metal guitar tone and during most of the song, the phrygian mode is used, which is a natural minor scale with a flatted second note.  It helps to add a dark atmosphere to the musical environment.  The best part of this song comes shortly after the renaissance-style keyboard solo followed by a guitar solo over the main riff.  I consider it one of Malmsteen's finest solos - well constructed and full of plenty of finger tapping, bends, and great modulations.  This is followed by a typical 80's keyboard part - PRICELESS! <br /> <br />There are only two tracks on this album with vocals, 'Now Your Ships are Burned' and 'As Above so Below'.  I prefer the first of the two.  The guitar playing has that muddy tone that I pointed out for the track, 'Little Savage'.  The main riff is progressive and is fantastic for soloing.  I'm a bit turned off by Jeff Scott Soto...he sounds like a second-rate vocalist, but what makes this record great is the guitar playing, and anyone who listens should understand this.  I would think it's quite obvious since he's only on two tracks. <br /> <br />Malmsteen also grew up playing violin and it's evident in his playing that he has roots in classical music.  Look no further than the pipe organ intro on 'As Above So Below' as well his integration of classical music with heavy metal on other groundbreaking instrumentals like 'Evil Eye' and 'Icarus Dream Suite Opus 4'.  This element makes Yngiwe the first true neo-classical metal guitarist.  Countless guitarists would use his sound in their own music in the years to follow, and some of them are more popular than Malmsteen, but he was always the major innovator of this style.  <br /> <br />In closing, I'd like to say that I believe all people who call themselves fans of heavy metal or great musicianship should own this album.  Also, if you are quick to label this as unoriginal, or music that lacks emotion, just remember...this came out in 1984, and Malmsteen was only 19 YEARS OLD!!!
B000063DIH|3.0|Fear of the Dark was the second Iron Maiden album. I bought it and it is a dissapointing. It's not really bad, but not as good as it should be.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maidens \\"Brave New World\\" was my first Maiden album I bought. Of course I heard some of their music before, but not really much. After I bought this album, I was really exited about it and I wanted more and more and more, so I bought \\"Fear of the Dark\\", \\"Dance of Death\\", \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Number of the Beast\\", but this one is my favourite. The best songs are \\"Wicker Man\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Blood Brothers\\", \\"Dream of Mirrors\\", \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"The Thin Line Between Love And Hate\\"...
B000060K4O|5.0|This was the start of the new Ghostbusters they also got suied by the people who did the Ghostbusters television show in the 70's. Three scientist catch ghost for a living the first ghost was slimer the green one in this hotel they shocked it their lazers then slide some device to suck it up. A black guy later on goin's them to do the job. The stay pump marshmellow man gets big walking around in New York.
B00092ZL80|5.0|If you're a fan of Chicago and Earth, Wind, and Fire then you will definitely want to add this DVD to your musical collection.  A 2-DVD set that tops out at 172 minutes, \\"Live At the Greek Theater\\" has a fantastic 5.1 Dolby sound that is crisp and pure and showcases the talent of these great musicians.  The cinematography, set designs and lighting are all top-notch and help to make this experience a treat for the senses.<br /><br />I've been a Chicago fan for years, but had little contact with EWF, so I was blown away by their energy and sheer musical abilities.  Lead singer Philip Bailey has amazing range and has the charisma to carry the EWF set.  The EWF DVD contains many of their memorable hits that sound as good today as they did in the 70's and 80's.  This band has not aged.  They blend so well with Chicago in the opening and closing acts that it's hard to believe they haven't been performing together for years.<br /><br />The Chicago set contains lengthy versions of many of their greatest hits, mixed successfully between 70's and 80's staples.<br /><br />They start with what is described as the \\"Make Me Smile Medley\\" which contains many of the selections from the \\"Ballet for a Girl From Buchannon\\" suite in \\"Chicago II\\" and end with \\"Hard To Say I'm Sorry/Get Away\\".  In between are nothing but classics.  Robert Lamm sounds great and the power trio of Walt Parazaider, Jimmy Pankow, and Lee Loughnane (the four remaining original members of the band) are in great form.<br /><br />This DVD is not to be missed!
B00007AJGH|5.0|I like this movie more now then I ever did back then. It was the first time they put cartoons into meet live action people. Roger rabbit is married to a beautiful woman name Jessica Rabbit. They have green stuff which is the only stuff that can kill a toon. Eddie Vialent is a dective who hate's toons cause his brother got murder by a toon. This movie needs to be rated PG-13.
B00005JNSK|4.0|The much-hyped and well-received Charlie and The Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl comes to live in this 2005 update. Staying mostly true to form, Tim Burton infuses much of his trademark direction with sophisticated robotic machinery and semi-mechanic setting in the chocolate factory which showcased what was portrayed in the book itself.<br /><br />Much credit should be given to Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore (who incidentally acted with Depp in Finding Neverland) for their roles as the eccentric Willy Wonka and the precarious and wide-eyed Charlie Bucket respectively. Once again, the pair's chemistry was unmistakable. Depp should expect an Oscar nod for his comedic and amusing performance as Willy Wonka (think Edward Scissorhands also helmed by Burton). Also deserving of praise is Deep Roy's potrayal of Oompa Loompa, the quirky little man-like creatures who looked exactly the same.<br /><br />Perhaps the only flaw in the movie are the awkard song and dance sequence which sometimes fail to be funny. Otherwise, this is a faithful adaptation with a zest of new life. (B+)
B000067FP7|5.0|Billy has a new pet that his father gave to him as a christman present. He brought it all they way from Japan he names the fury creature Gizmo. It does come with a set of rule #1 keep away from bright light he hates it especially sun light which could kill him, #2 don't get him wet with water let along giving him a bath, #3 the most important rule never ever feed him after midnight cause if that happen's he create an egg then he'll hatch out into a gremlin and turning bad.
B0000027I6|5.0|\\"Amused to Death\\" is a refinement of some of the themes Roger explored in \\"The Final Cut\\", combined with a cynical, at times bitter, attack on the infatuation of western society with the television and media (see 'Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.' by Alan Postman, ISBN: 0140094385). It ties in with the lessons learnt in Vietnam that the management of the media is an important part of war - images of smart bombs hitting anonymous buildings are so much more palatable than those of small children burning.  <br /> <br />It's an album which requires more than a casual listen; very few of the tracks will \\"stick\\" in the way that more facile pop songs will. In particular the sub-text of the opening and closing tracks is harrowing, as a WW1 veteran describes leaving a fellow soldier in the trenches to die of his wounds. High points include \\"It's a Miracle\\" and the title track, \\"Amused to Death\\". <br /> <br />Recommended for cynics and misanthropes everywhere. The rest of you can go back to watching \\"Friends\\".
6305784116|5.0|I saw this as a kid at the library as one of those reading and movie things. It reminds me of Gay Puree,without the mother with her kittens. I loved the scene where Thomas O'Malley saved Duchess and the kittens from being sent away[again] by Edgar,He's a good cat,and a wonderful father to Toulouse,Marie,and I forgot.I also loved the River Rescue scene where Thomas O'Malley saves Marie from drowning.
B000001Y2U|3.0|I just got more into Marilyn since listening to the Matrix soundtracks.  To be honest, I like some of the things he's done, (Personal Jesus, The Nobodies, Coma White, etc.) but Antichrist Superstar as a whole feels more hollow than some would care to admit.  He has some good points and potent messages like \\"The Beautiful People\\" and \\"Tourniquet,\\" but a lot of the album tries selling the whole \\"satanist\\" angle too much, as if it doesn't believe its own image, but tries to convince itself anyway.  I don't think Marilyn's a satanist...  hedonist, I can buy, but not a devil-worshipper.  He has talent and an artistic vision -- check out the album sleeve if you doubt it -- plus makes some very thought-provoking songs about society as a whole, but this is more of an average album that plays with the shock value too much to be entirely convincing.  A handful of good songs to rip onto your harddrive, with the rest you can take or leave...
B00001QEE6|5.0|I love this Movie! I love the scene where Tramp Saves Lady from the dog or something,and I think he saves a baby from a fire. I have this on VHS.I want this on DVD.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|There are so MANY TV shows coming out with their seasons one, two and more within months of each other. <br /> <br />We are getting tired of waiting for Season Two!!! <br /> <br />Can't we vote for this or something?? <br /> <br />PLEASE--- bring out the next season!!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I got this on VHS,and I would love to have the DVD,too. The Wicked Stepmother/Witch gets it in the end,and Snow White marries the Prince.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I have been a Buble fan since I first saw him on the Super Bowl a few years ago. This guy just keeps getting better if it's possible! <br />The first cut on this album sets the tone for a red hot feeling good album. Aptly titled It's Time tells you what you need to know. <br />Buble has arrived and we know Elvis has left the building.
B00005J6T0|5.0|I have been listening to Madonna since the very early 90's and True Blue was my very first album from her and ever since I have loved this ENTIRE album!!!  I noticed that a lot of people HATE Jimmy Jimmy, I don't know why!!  Jimmy Jimmy is such a cool upbeat song to dance to and it TOTALLY reminds me of a 50's or 60's girl group song!!  I love it!!<br /><br />My all time favorite song off this album though is the title track, True Blue.  This is THE song from the 50's!!  I mean the whole sound and style and singing sounds TOTALLY 50's!!!  I LOVE it!!!  I love the part that goes \\"True Love Oh Baby, True Love Oh Baby, True Love Oh Baby\\"  Another favorite is La Isla Bonita.  This is such a beautiful Spanish style ballad!!  Live To Tell is a hauntingly beautiful ballad, I love it!  White Heat is a cool upbeat song that has dialog and this was dedicated to Jimmy Cagney.  Papa Don't Preach is another favorite upbeat song, just like Open Your Heart, they're both awesome upbeat songs!  Where's The Party and Love Makes The World Go Round are awesome upbeat songs too!<br /><br />There are NO bad songs on here!  They're all amazing!!  Especially True Blue because of the unique 50's girl group style and La Isla Bonita because of the Spanish sound to it!  A MUST HAVE for Madonna fans!
B00097DX3U|4.0|So this is the second album from Chris, Tom, Brad and Tim together and it's great. Chris claims to have stopped smoking and the strength, fluidity and beauty that is his voice, seems to appreciate it. His voice sounds wonderful as it did on their first album together but even better.  <br /> <br />Audioslave's first album was great but Out of Exile is a different kind of great. Their first album seemed to state: \\"We were in R.A.T.M. and Soundgarden but we can create great music even without those guys.\\" This album is a lot more fun. It seems they've proven that and have moved on--Out of Exile.  <br /> <br />\\"Your Time Has Come\\" and \\"Be Yourself\\" are the reason you by the album. They are the songs that pull listeners of different music genres in, but songs like--\\"The Worm\\" and \\"Man or Animal\\" with Tim's vivid and Tom's non-showboaty guitar skills; \\"Out of Exile\\" and \\"Yesterday To Tomorrow\\" with both Chris' amazing voice and writing skills on showcase as well as \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" which even had me thinking Brad's drum skills are pretty awesome--are the reason you keep playing the album over and over and over.........again. <br /> <br />All of the songs show a nice cohesion of pure rock--no one tries to out-do one another. They seemed to have really worked on these songs as a whole rather than just having Brad, Tom and Tim come up with the music and Chris with the lyrics. Everything seems pulled together for a reason rather than just because, or the instrument was there--every sound of the album is put there for a reason. It should DEFINATELY be put in your CD player. <br /> <br />A few more of my favorites are \\"Dandelion,\\"  \\"#1 Zero\\" and of course \\"Out of Exile.\\" I would give it 4.5 stars because only Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning\\" gets 5 stars on my scale.

B000A3OS14|4.0|Great fun to hear these 80s hits done in a lounge, cool style. Only In the air tonight I found to be not quite well due to a similar vocal performance to Phil Collins, being it way too close to the original version.
B00004XMV6|2.0|Usually it's not my game to publish spoilers on this site but fret not, there isn't much to spoil here (were it not for film-like credits and sporadic bursts of tub-thumping music, you might  in fact mistake this for a soft core video) -- they meet at a butcher's, eye oh so suggestively, then meet again, and again, and again. That's your film there. Humble apologies.<br /><br />Both Rourke and Basinger should look fetching to their respective audiences. Their attire showcases delicious variety over all the rendezvous, ranging from wet and clingy to missing in action. Yet they traipse through their shenanigans like cyborgs, hissing much of the time and looking so painfully unsure one has an uncontrollable urge to furnish an obligatory smack on the head and a pointer to get on with it already.<br /><br />I'm delighted for reviewers here who found something to enjoy in this teenage fantasy yarn -- the delicate vicissitudes of romance, the subtle games thereof, the dynamics of eros, all that jazz.<br /><br />Frankly, this reviewer would much rather have some semblance of a story, thank you. That failing, some goofy chitchat of the Before Sunrise variety would be fine. But all play and no talk makes 9.5 weeks an awefully dull time. I watched it with a 4x fast-forward, stopping at strategic locations as fitting, but that hardly  makes for a recommendation does it.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|To put it short, I bought this film based solely on the descrition on the back of the box and the fact that it was unrated. I figured it would show \\"male sexuality\\" as it is now. Boy was I wrong. I wouldn't even give this movie a star but you have to put something on it to leave a review about it. The best scene in the movie? The oral scene but it was totally blown to hell when the buy busts into tears and gets on the bed in a fetal position. If this is \\"male sexuality\\" at its best, then every guy in the world needs counseling along with everybody else that watched this p.o.s. movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I read the book two years ago, saw the play last year, and play the CD constantly!  It is a cheerful, fun analysis of what happended before we all heard of Dorothy in Oz.  The music brings back all the memories from the book and play.  It is quite spirited!
0425188809|5.0|This was the first Dean Koontz book I've read. I was given the book by a friend/co-worker for my 25th birtday. This book is a tresure to me. <br /> <br />Without offending any of Mr. Koontz's fans I have to say I was somewhat disappointed with his writing. I felt his prose weak, and his use of weak and unecessary adjectives a bit disconcerting. (Sorry Mr. Koontz)Still in all this proves what I'll always stand by, if you have a good story with a strong plot like Watchers, it doesn't matter how poor the writing. <br /> <br />Not that the writing was poor. It just wasn't up to par and felt that anyone else who may have written it could've done a better job with the prose. I hate saying that because I loved the book. <br /> <br />I was so in love with Einstein and hated the Outsider. In the end the author made you pity the horrible monster, and made you understand why people do things they do in life despite the consequences. This book is a tale about human suffarage and has inspired me so. <br /> <br />Kudos to Mr. Koontz and his fantastic outlook on life. As an animal lover with a friend who I consider just as important as Nora and Travis regarded Enistein, I hold this book dear to my heart. Despite the harhness of my previous words, loving the story and loving the author for his work is what matters afterall!
B00005ABX0|5.0|Smiley Smile is a terrific album, and definitely should rank among the most underrated, overlooked masterpieces of the last 200 years. <br /> <br />Sure, it wasn't \\"SMiLE\\", but it stands alone as a great work of art with its own merits. The songs, \\"Heroes and Villains\\", \\"Good Vibrations\\", and the several rare bonus tracks make the CD well worth buying, yet the CD offers much more than that. <br /> <br />If you like offbeat, eclectic songs, you will love Smiley Smile. This stuff is far wackier and stranger than anything the Beatles, Pink Floyd, or anyone else was doing at the time, or really since. But the songs aren't just strange and mystifying; they're also quite beautiful and enchanting. <br /> <br />The vocal harmony work on Smiley Smile is among the best the group ever did. The instrumentation is sparse on some songs, and deliciously rich and intricate on others. The album is an amazing tapestry of wild sound effects, beautiful vocals, haunting instrumentation, gorgeous melodies, psychedelic clownery, and genius concepts. <br /> <br />I could go on and on about Smiley Smile. It's one of my personal favorite albums and I never get tired of listening to it. But Smiley Smile is only half (in volume) of what the CD offers. I don't have much to say about Wild Honey other than there are several good songs on it, and it's a solid album with a consistent sound. The production is minimal as is most of the instrumentation. Overall, it's a good album worth owning if you like the Beach Boys. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks on this disc are just amazing. You get to hear an alternate version of Heroes and Villains often referred to as the \\"Cantina\\" version, and some of the tracking sessions for Good Vibrations, which is really quite cool. There's also a wonderful a capella song, originally from the 4 Freshman, that the Boys do with incredible grace and remarkable beauty. \\"Can't Wait Too Long\\" is apparently a SMiLE-era outtake that was never used, but it's hard to see why; it'sa great song. <br /> <br />Basically, if you are a Beach Boys enthusiast and really like Brian's experimental side, you must get this CD. These Capitol \\"two-fers\\" are a great value, and this one in particular is a real gem.
B00005JNTX|4.0|It's is hard to describe this film in words!!! Everything about this film is amazing, stylish, and plainly eye candy with each action scene eclipsing the last. This film is based on the comic book series called \\"Sin City\\", and this movie has such detail and is able to explain the entire world surrounding it in one movie, which is like 4 short movies in one!!! It is one of those films that some people will love, like, or hate; it is rated R for a reason!!!  <br /> <br /> It has that dark and gritty feel to it, along with an exotic take on the city, and how Basin City (Sin City) is!!! Love or hate, you have to admit that this film has got to be the most stylish film of the year so far, second next to the Matrix!!!Rodregiuz and Tarantino team up to make an innovative and original film, that will change the way you look at films like it or not!!! This movie is a combination of when \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" meets \\"The Matrix\\", mixed with \\"Spawn\\", along with the \\"Godfather\\" feel in a comic form, with plainly awesome innovative visually effects!!!  <br /> <br /> It has the dark, gritty, horror feel of \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\", the action packed and visual eye candy of \\"The Matrix\\", along with the dark hero example: (taking out ten armed cops out in slow motion), redemption feel as Spawn did, and the underworld mafia feel of \\"The Godfather\\"!!! It is also can be related to the film and mavel comic \\"The Punisher\\" as well as \\"Spawn\\", as Mickey Rouke's character avenges his love's death as a tough guy, under dog dark hero killing his way to answers!!! It also has a little bit of a mystery feel to it!!!  <br /> <br /> The redemtion part comes in when (Bruce Willis) character, a cop, who saved her life, but from the major's son and injured him!!! He is locked up due to the crooked major( thats what I mean by mafia, underworld, \\"Godfather\\" feel), and serves an 8 year jail sentence as he then he must save her (Jessica Alba's character- damn she is HOT), once again from the major's son, now looking like an alien, as he quotes \\"Old man dies, little girl lives; .... fair trade, as he gives his life to protect her!!!  <br /> <br /> The underground and exotic parts come in when a guy, (Clive Owen)teams up with the prostutes wage war against the mobsters and cops; to stop a civil war between them!!! Kind of an Amazons from hell, meets The Mafia in a duel to the death!!! This all starts when a guy(undercover cop/ no know of at the time) is harassing his girlfriend (Britney Murphy), and he isn't pleased about it, and pursues him in anger!!!  <br /> <br /> Well, the Amazon war ladies take care of them, but it turns out that he is a cop which would ignite a civil war between them!!! The mafia want the war so that they can make the prostutes their slaves. It's up to him to dispose of the bodies, then he is ambushed by mercs, and after a chain of events it turns into a blood bath, well the whole movie has been!!!  <br /> <br /> What can, I say can you can tell, by giving brief descritions of the movie that this is unique from anyother movie I've seen!!! Most of this movie has that larger than life feel, in the underworld feel, with a lot of star power to top it all off!!! It's kind of has the feel that \\"Kill Bill\\" films had if you know what I mean!!! This film has a lot of creativity and will be a gem for a fan of comic books, dark gritty, action, with nice black and white visual eye candy with 4 stories in one movies along with some great special effects on disc 2!!!  <br /> <br /> Love or hate it, you got admit this film is the first of it's kind and is the absolute most stylish, fil of the year!!! This film though is not for everybody, it may be to dark and gritty for some peoples tastes, but if you're a person like me you'll get a kick out of it!!! It was surprisind and completely unexpected, but very artsy, overall not the best, but definettly the most stylish!!! Overall, I will give this a 4/5!!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Network performance on TV in June was an event.  The full DVD of Farewell Tour 1 is just unbelievable. You don't need to be an avid Eagles fan for this DVD to give you chills!<br /><br />One might forget how great the Eagles and their music really was AND IS.  All about life, passion, emotion, it's all here in this collection. Getting them all back on stage together was an unbelievable emotional event. They say they are performing BETTER together now. You will agree when you see this DVD of their concert in Melbourne. Overall, the playing and the harmonizing has never been better.  And some of it may actuality be better NOW.<br /><br />The DVD includes more songs than the televised concert; all their best songs, both Eagles and some solo releases, plus 3 new songs that are great too.  The comments about the tour (special features) though a little sparse, provide some interesting insight into how they feel about their music and performing it, today.<br /><br />In Henley's words, we can do as many farewell tours as we want, as long as we number them . By all appearances that's true. Even if they do more farewell tours THIS is THE DVD to have. It belongs on everybody's short list of great ones to collect.
0553260111|3.0|Like many others, I read THE BOURNE IDENTITY because I enjoyed the movie so much.  The book is always better, right?  Well, not always.  Although THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an okay book, it is an example of the fortunately rare event of the movie being better.  The book does not have the swift pace and action of the movie and often bogs down in useless plot twists that add little to the plot but protract the book to an unnecessary degree.    For instance, in the movie, Bourne discovers the implant in his hip, goes to the bank, discovers large wads of cash and weapons, withdraws it, leaves and - BAM - onto the action.  The book, by contrast, has Bourne facing the intracacies of -GASP - an arcane banking regulation that prevents him from withdrawing his cash.  Not exactly the reason I read a political espionage thriller.    Bourne's relationship with the woman Marie is also rather tough to swallow.  After Bourne takes her hostage and really treats her rather roughly, she realizes that he is really a good guy and so her feelings of hostility turn to feelings of love instead.  Come on!  Even if her hostility were to abate, it is too much of a stretch for her to fall for Bourne that hard, that fast and under those circumstances.    The portrayal of Bourne's relationship with Marie is further undermined by the truly sappy language the author employs.  The text is full of references to \\"my love,\\" \\"my darling,\\" \\"love me Jason, just love me\\" and further such wince-inducing dialogue.  I am sorry, call me a purist, but the only times the words \\"my love\\" or \\"my darling\\" should appear in a book of this nature is when a man is talking about his feelings towards a particular piece of semi-automatic weaponry to get an assignment done. Over the top writing is, alas, not limited to Bourne's and Marie's love fests but pervades the entire book.  Bourne's flashbacks are written in a similar fashion.    Again, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is not bad.  In fact, it is pretty good.  But if a reader is looking for the excitement and action of the movie, well folks, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you will not find it here.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Buy \\"American Life\\" because it is a great album, not because of some freakos saying it sucks because they are part of 'teamlamb'.  check out their depressing website: <br />[...] <br /> <br />On the other hand, \\"American Life\\" is one of Madonna's better albums.  There is a certain truth and maturity which is present throughout this album.  This is a maturity of a female celebrity that has achieved it all and questions the consequences of her fame.  Even though this album was trashed critically and financially, it was trashed without looking at the entire picture.  This is an album for people who like to think and reflect upon their lives, lives of friends and family, and society.  It is ONE person's story of how she contemplates life and formulates an opinion, which unfortunately is not popular within pop culture or the entertainment industry.  Artistically, it is one of Madonna's best.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I hear all of you on the copy protection complaints. I also hear those of you who have no problem at all. <br />When I got the CD, I imported into my sister's Apple at her house. NO PROBLEM! Got home, put it in my PC, into iTunes, after reading all that MediaMax garbage and getting stupid messages from Explorer saying it wouldn't work. Play it in iTunes; I couldn't understand a word he was saying. After a lot of hassle, including taking the CD back to the store, I finally took my iPod to my sister's and got the songs from her. Now I can't play the songs on my computer. No more copy-protected CDS for me. <br /> <br />Anyways, about the discs, THEY ROCK!! I love the Foos, Dave Grohl is awesome.  The songs are very catchy.  Not very original, some of them sound the same. My favorite Foo song is still Everlong.  When you think about it, the songs seem basic, about love maybe, but they're not. Best of You is about Bush? Weird. I prefer not to get to deep into it or I find out their real meanings and I'm totally turned off. Great idea, doing 2 discs for the price of one. Still, the Foos are the BEST BAND EVER and they always will be. <br />
B000003TAW|5.0|I bought this record from BMG about 10 yrs ago, back when the song \\"Buddy Holly\\" was popular.  Expecting a generic rock album with one hit track, I was pleasantly surprised by the melodic pop-rock goodness that came forth from my stereo.  This album has staying power, it remains popular among rock music fans over ten years after its release.<br /><br />Commonly referred to as the \\"Blue Album\\", this record stands like a spire towering above its contemporaries.  If you buy it out of a sense of 90's nostalgia, I bet dollars to donuts you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is a solid album, nearly every track is a golden nugget of pop vocals and rock guitars.  It's Generation X's answer to \\"Pet Sounds\\" or \\"Rubber Soul\\".  At 11 yrs old now, it probably isn't long before rock critics begin to mention it in the same reverential way they mention those old classics of the late 60's.<br /><br />If one can describe any album as \\"essential\\", then this is on such a list.  One cannot possibly deign to talk about rock music in the 90's without an awareness of this record.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Constantine was an unusual character for a comic book, which explains why the DC/Vertigo comic book \\"Hellblazer\\" was rather unusual, so it is not surprising that this 2005 film is a bit different as well.  However, \\"Hellblazer\\" fans may well find the changes in the character to outweigh the fact John Constantine has been brought to the big screen and be disappointed.  But then they already know that from having seen director Francis Lawrence's movie in the theater.  What are left are those who never read \\"Swamp Thing\\" or \\"Hellblazer\\" and are drawn by Kenau Reeves being in the film to check out the DVD.<br /><br />Basically, what those viewers need to know about the hero is as follows.  John Constantine became involved with the occult when he was a youngster, and has always had a problem in that he was never really as good as he thought that he was.  Being cocky and brash works well when you are making deals with the minions of Hell, but can be problematic when you are trying to exorcize demons from little girls.  But Constantine can do magic, although he usually exaggerates what he is actually capable of doing and the legends about him are more impressive than his actual accomplishments.  He also happens to be dying of lung cancer, so whatever he is going to do in this world he has to ge done relatively soon.<br /><br />The tagline for \\"Constantine\\" encapsulates the characters situation as: \\"Hell wants him.  Heaven won't take him.  Earth needs him.\\"  We eventually get a glimpse of Hell, which is, visually at least, an ongoing nuclear firestorm that constitutes a memorable modern version of Dante's Inferno, but for most of this film Hell is in the shadows.  Constantine (Reeves) has been busy sending half-demons back to Hell when he is not busy smoking himself to death, but now full demons are showing up on earth.  This is a violation of the agreement between God and Lucifer, so something big and bad is brewing.  The focal point for Constantine's investigation is the sudden suicide ofa mental patient, whose twince sister, Angela (Rachel Weisz), is a police detective (andt therefore a professional realist who will have trouble believing what Constantine has to say).<br /><br />\\"Constantine\\" is more of a horror film than a comic book film, even with the set-up of the title character as something of a superhero.  Cinematically it is clearly going for more of a sense of film noir than we normally get in either genre, which is an interesting and effective visual style (previously Lawrence had done only music videos).  Unfortunately, the characters and plot are not up to the images (this is another movie where the best special effects pretty much show up in the trailer).  The problem may well be not just that viewers have to be brought up to speed on the character of Constantine in a way that is unnecessary with the first rank comic book heroes such as Batman and Spider-Man, but that you have to have more of an appreciation for Catholic theology than you get from having read \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  The again, the Bible tends to see that great battle in terms of black and white, while the world of Constantine is pretty much gray (with blood red splatters).  After all, the angelic Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) does not seem particularly nice for a heavenly being (which gets us back to your understanding of Catholic theology) and not that different from Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale).<br /><br />Then again the problem could be as simple as the casting of Reeves as the reluctant hero dealing with his curse.  Reeves has a definite look in this film, but it is not the look of John Constantine.  More importantly, the character is too different from the one in the comic book.  Granted, you have to have read \\"Hellblazer\\" to know that, but I am here to argue that the caustic S.O.B. of the comic book would work better in this storyline than what Reeves provides, especially when Satan himself (Peter Stormare) shows up for a chat.  Whether he intended to or not, the way Reeves plays Constantine is just too much like Neo in \\"The Matrix,\\" which is wrong on several key levels.  Still, given the visual strengths of the production and the way Keeves wants to go with the character maybe the greatest fault with this movie lies with the basic story that Kevin Brodbin came up with (Brodbin and Frank Cappello did the screenplay) from the comic books written by Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis.  There should have been a better way of making this all work.intended to or not, the way Reeves plays Constantine is just too much like Neo in \\"The Matrix,\\" which is wrong on several key levels.

0425129616|4.0|A woman goes into a seizure induced by strychnine in her coffee in the middle of the night. The only problem? Strychnine is extremly fast acting, and the woman drank her coffee more than three hours earlier. So thus, Hercule Poirot, the eccentric Belgian detective with little grey cells is on the case. Christie's first novel is good, although definitly not her best. It still has some serious flair, and the late Dame knew how to pull the wool over her reader's eyes. The dialouge has a few flaws, as does locations and enviroment, but the plot is air tight. Fun and fast, this is a prime example of Agatha Christie.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Robert Duvall's performance as Captain Augustus McCrae in \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is the finest of his career, which is saying something when you are talking about an actor who did memorable supporting roles in \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now\\" to go along with Oscar nominated performances in \\"The Great Santini\\" and \\"The Apostle,\\" as well as winning an Academy Award for \\"Tender Mercies.\\"  Actually, that last one may well be one of his lesser efforts, but that only speaks to the high regard in which the acting community holds Duvall.  When Duvall did not win an Emmy for this performance I was both stunned and outraged.  The Emmy went to James Woods for \\"My Name Is Bill,\\" which was certainly a fine performance, but not as memorable as Duvall's.  Maybe he lost votes to his co-star Tommy Lee Jones, who knows.<br /><br />Having watched \\"Lonesome Dove\\" again I am still impressed by Duvall's performance and have developed a new respect for that of Jones as Captain Woodrow F. Call as well.  The problem the first time around was that I resented Call's character because he was still alive at the end and because he refuses to give Newt his name.  However, I am older now and more willing to accept Call's explanation that he put more value on his horse than he did his own name.  Besides, he did honor his promise to bury Gus back in Texas, and the irony between that return journey and the cattle trek that serves as the dramatic impetus for the narrative is important to the story Larry McMurtry is telling.  Fortunately, early on Gus McRae lets us know that the subject matter here is not death, but life.<br /><br />Saying that \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is about an epic cattle drive does not really suggest how lyrical of a western this 1989 mini-series ended up being.  In the twilight of his life Woodrow Call is tired of living in the Texas border town of Lonesome Dove and decides to get himself a herd of cattle to drive to Montana, where they will be the first cattlemen to settle the new territory.  Call and McCrae hire on a team of cowboys, and set off.  Included in the group is trail scout Joshua Deets (Danny Glover), the patient Dish Boggett (D.B. Sweeney), and young Newt (Rick Schroeder), who McCall refuses to acknowledge as his son despite the insistence of Gus.  Following in their wake is Jake Spoon (Robert Urich), an ex-ranger who would rather spend time gambling, and Lorena Wood (Diane Lane), a prostitute who is on friendlier terms with Gus than Jake can stand.  Meanwhile, July Johnson (Chris Cooper), an Arkansas sheriff is on Jake's trail, unaware that his pregnant wife, Elmira (Glenne Headly) has taken off to find her first husband, who is not dead but in jail.  If that was not enough to keep life interesting on the trail, the infamous Blue Duck (Frederic Forrest) crosses their path as well.  Then there is Clara Allen (Anjelica Huston), an old beau of Gus's who lives on a ranch in Nebraska, which is just a stop along the way.<br /><br />It is hard to measure triumph against the scale of tragedy in \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" especially given the high body count along the way.  But death only serves to give this epic its greatness, creating the foundation that allows Woodrow's realism to co-exist with the romanticism represented by Gus.  After all, that is what our vision of the Old West is all about.  For Call actions speak louder than words, which is why words fail him in the end with Newt, while Gus always has something to say and no lack of ways to express himself.  It makes sense to me now that Gus has to be dead by the final act of this story, because otherwise Call's silence would not be allowed to stand.  That is also why there is such poignancy in the final letter Gus writes to Lorie, who does not know how to read his final words and wants to put off having them read to her.  At the end of these six hours I am not sure if my criticism that it should have been longer is valid or if that simply recognizes the fact that I was loathe for the tale to end.The special features on the DVD include interviews with novelist Larry McMurtry and producer Suzanne de Passe, a long section of textual notes regarding the history of cattle drives; a trivia game, and brief biographies and filmographies for the cast and crew.  All of these serve to extend the experience a bit longer.tale to end.

0312263120|1.0|Hi, I'm a Spanish guy currently living in NYC. I simply love this city and the whole country. I've lived in other places here in the US (Wisconsin, California, New Jersey...), and I had a great time everywhere.  I usually travel to my country two or three times every year, and every once in a while I find people who tell how much they dislike the US. I always ask them the same questions: have you ever been there? Do you know people over there? Do you know that USA is not just what you see on the movies? Etc. <br /> <br />There are a lot of people that judge things without knowing absolutely anything about it. I think WE should try to learn more about the things we're talking or writing about.  <br /> <br />Definitively, Mr. Brown has not been in Seville or in any other place in Spain, and if he has, he must have been together with Mr. Brownstone. He's description of Seville is absolutely FALSE. It's like if someone describes Salt Lake City as the city of drugs, violence and sex. Absolutely FALSE. Hence, how can we expect any kind of reality on the descriptions in any of his books?  <br /> <br />Anyway, I couldn't finish reading The Da Vinci Code and I won't read Digital Fortress, they're pretty boring. But I guess it's not an impartial point of view any more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
6305313687|5.0|I first got American History X because 1. One of my good friends said it was an amazing movie and that I would love it (probably because I love thought provokers.. and dramas) and 2. Because it is one of the greatest movies EVER made, and also one of the most important. <br /> <br />In all of my 15 years, I have never been shown so much hatred, besides the death of my neighbor Nick Berg in Iraq. West Chester is a very harmless place, and I first heard of the beheading, the whole town was in a shock, much like the setting of American History X. This movie is so powerful, and its message hits you with a sludgehammer.  <br /> <br />You have most likely read the summary of the movie, but what makes it so great? First off, this is a film that you're not even sure you like till the very end. Why? It's content is so strong, that you'll find yourself grimacing, turning away, crying, astonished, and so many others. I can't even begin to tell you how many emotions I felt while viewing this movie. <br /> <br />Edward Norton does an unbelievable job in this film, acting as a skinhead. He gives such an ominous presence when the camera is turned on him, and that swastika on his chest only adds to this effect. Not only is Norton good, but the rest of the cast as well. This film follows the whole Vinyard family through the death of Mr. Vinyard, to Derek's imprisonment, to his change of heart, and his brothers.  <br /> <br />Edward Furlong, who plays Dannie Vinyard, does an excellent job as a younger actor. This kid shows so much emotion in his acting that it's hard not to be able to relate.  <br /> <br />The hardest part in viewing this movie.... is that it's so real. This stuff really does happen, all over the world, and especially in america. And yes, there are MILLIONS of people like Derek Vinyard. The only thing that we can do, is watch a film such as this, and learn from our mistakes. Ask ourselves the important question, \\"has anything you've done in your life, made it better?\\" That question is specifically pointed towards the racist in the world... ask yourselves that question, and think about it. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this film, just please, parents and older brothers alike, keep this away from the younger children. It already upset, and disturbed me and i've seen tons of these type of movies (although none quite like this) and this tops them all. There is excessive cursing, and I mean a lot. Violent murders, including a curb stomp, and sex, and a scene of rape.  <br /> <br />All I can say is, rent this movie, soon. See what it's all about, see the undeniable truth in our society, and the pain. This is certainly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Thanks for reading.

B00005JNSK|5.0|The new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory represents exactly what the audience should expect from a Tim Burton film: exuberant sets that challenge all possible camera angles and show a kitsch quality; weird supporting characters that prove to be a critic and piercing look at the American suburban world, Danny Elfman's exquisite music and as a cherry top, the presence of Johnny Depp, in his fifth collaboration with Burton.<br /><br />The original 1971 film had a clear anchor in the pop visual look of the times; Burton's film evokes some 60's pictures in his art direction, photography and in the sweet innocence quality that all movies lack in the present. Without a doubt, the production design, art direction, costumes and sets are worthy of an Oscar; as well as Elfman's score, who added music to the verses written by Ronald Dahl, the author of the book.<br /><br />Likewise, we should speak of Johnny Depp's performance for his extraordinary creation of Wonka. Compared to Gene Wilder's character in the 71' film, Depp's Wonka is more repressed, more peculiar and far more apt to this version, because it looks real and nostalgia-free.<br /><br />The casting was terrific, from my point of view, and no one dissapointed in that department. A special mention to the man who played the Oompa Loompas...he was just superb and hilarious, in a freaky way, but terrific!!<br /><br />In conclusion, I think Burton's version is superior, its ending more wholesome and its sensibility definitely more contemporary. This movie has updated all the elements that became somewhat obsolete in the 1971 film. All these aspects have enriched the story, and this makes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a very sweet treat.

0553573403|4.0|I don't know if there is a fantasy series with more hype than George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. And that's why I picked it up. And after reading all those reviews about the violence, sex, violence, and sex I was worried it would be too over the top and completely unbelievable. But it wasn't so bad.<br /><br />Like many who did not rate this book well I like my fantasy to be escapism into a realm full of wonder where the good guys take it to the baddies. I guess that kind of fantasy is \\"safe\\". You can feel comfortable with the other fantasy novels because you know good is going to triumph in the end.A Game of Thrones is just not that kind of fantasy.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said there are no real good or bad guys. I did not find that to be true. It seemed to me that one family was based on honor and another on seeking power. And there are definite examples of evil characters. I mean c'mon, you've put a guy's head on a spike for a crime he didn't commit and then force one of his family members to look the head in the eyes just to get a reaction... Just like Michael Jackson, the reader knows \\"Who's bad\\".<br /><br />I didn't think I would go for this kind of dark and gritty fantasy, but it really is a wonderful book filled with excellent characters. It's written beautifully as well. Most people will say fantasy novels are all very similar. I agree for the most part, but I haven't read any others like this one yet.<br /><br />And it's not just the violence and sex that make it that way. It's the intrigue. It's the characters. It's the raw emotions. Personally I thought the sex scene between a young woman and a barbarian served a purpose in defining the two characters' relationship. It's graphic, but certainly not on the pornographic level. Now the other sex scenes and the neverending talk of brothels seemed unecessary in my opinion.<br /><br />And let's not forget the violence. People die... a lot. Main characters die and other characters die in the same chapter in which we meet them. I'm okay with it as long as the story progresses. That is the strength of this book. Big as it is, it goes somewhere and you want to find out where.<br /><br />I was weary heading into this one. But I did like it, and I will read the next one.racters die in the same chapter in which we meet them. I'm okay with it as long as the story progresses. That is the strength of this book.

B000002KFJ|5.0|This is a kick-ass Heavy Metal album. It is, in my not particulatly humble opinion, the heaviest, meaniest, most downright NASTY and sinister sounding album that Sabbath did while Ozzy Osbourne was a member, and possibly the darkest thing they ever did period. That part is debatable, I suppose. The songwriting is very... (whats the word?), good. Full of epic metal. The songs have a slightly \\"prog\\" quality to them (but much darker and more uncompromisingly doomy than the prog-metal of \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\"), IMO. Long-ish, \\"epic\\" numbers with various different parts in each song that take you on dark lyrical journeys of depression, paranoia, and insanity. The lyrics (most of which I believe were written by Geezer Butler, NOT Ozzy Osbourne, as is the case with most Sabbath albums of this era) are more introspective that some of their earlier albums. Rather than the social commentary of the \\"Paranoid\\" album, which dealt with subjects like war (War Pigs), and drug addiction/casualties (Hand of Doom), \\"Sabotage\\" deals with more personal turmoil. <br /> <br />If you like Sabbath, or you're a Heavy Metal fan, you need this album! These are the roots of modern Metal. All the dark, evil-sounding stuff you hear all the time came straight from this band.
B00068CVJ4|4.0|Being a pretty big Mars volta fan I decided to check this album out, and at first listen I was horrified at the lead singers vacous non melodic excuses for a voice.  I understand that the singing was actually collaborative work, but just listen to The Mars Volta and you'll be blown away by earnest beautiful talented singing and screeching. I suppose Bixler really found his true self/voice on tremulant.  Most of the music on this album is  brilliant, but is seriously, seriously marred by some of the droning vocals.  After some time I decided to overlook this \\"scar\\" and focus on the music.  I have to give this album 4 stars because it cannot be easily ignored, although at times you'll be shaking your head at the nonsense vocal workings.

B00005JN2Z|3.0|Maybe I'm just in a really so-so mood this week, but sorry kids, this one didn't do it for me either. I have to say I liked Tom Cruise with the gray hair. The beard could go, but the gray hair was good. It was also cool to see him in such an atypical Cruise role. I mean, he was the BAD GUY. So that was neat. The movie itself was trying pretty hard to be all deep and artsy, but mostly it just ended up being mediocre with a pretty cool cast. I liked some of the symbolism, but it was overdone in a hit-you-over-the-head sort of way and the characters ended up more as caricatures than real people the audience could relate to. See it for Tom Cruise (even though he's a wacko), but overall, not earth-shatteringly anything.
0805076476|5.0|I read this book because Palahniuk is my second favorite author and I have been working my way through all of his books. <br />  <br /> Fight Club is about a generation of men without fathers, who through depersonalization and destruction of not only society but also self, seek to create a world living in the moment. The story begins when one of these fatherless men, the narrator, forms a split personality when unable to cope with the constraints, weight, and hopelessness of society. This separate identity, Tyler, is everything the narrator wishes it could be and more. Through assuming shared control of the narrator's body during the day and full control when he is \\"asleep,\\" Tyler soon builds an Army of fight club members. These men come to fight for the same reason Tyler has been manifested which leads to his worship as a god while the narrator is still under the impression that Tyler is another human being. While all of this occurs both of the narrator's personalities share an unusual relationship with Marla Singer, a twisted woman who the narrator originally hates but Tyler wants. Eventually through Marla's involvement the narrator realizes Tyler is apart of him which lands him in a sky scraper packed with nitroglycerin intended to dismantle the past by destroying a major museum. The explosives fail, Tyler \\"dies,\\" and the narrator ends up in a mental hospital delusional as ever. <br /> <br /> This novel was easily one of the best I've ever read. The explanation is simple, as is with all of Palahniuk's books, his style makes the book. Palahniuk's style could be described as vivid, explosive, crass, and eloquent all at once. His style ties the plot and all of the outrageous incidents (many based on real life) together and makes for an exhilarating experience leaving one feeling as crazy as Tyler by the end. The material presented in Fight Club from the speeches intended to indoctrinate the space monkeys to the narrator's relief found between the bosoms of Bob is all presented in a very visceral manner which allows the reader to easily get within the narrator's confused mind. As well, although the subject of the fatherless men attempting to destroy any semblance of society, history, and themselves is quite outlandish; due to Palahniuk's organization, style, and filler it appears rational and accepted further allowing the reader passage into the narrator's mind. Overall I feel the book can be described as an intense journey into the trouble mind of the generation forgotten. I strongly recommend it. <br />                                              -DR

B000957O82|4.0|I'm a Will Smith fan. Not his music so much, but his humor. He has good timing and a fun style. It's hard NOT to like him. That said, this is a pretty good departure for him. I don't think I've ever seen him in a really romantic role. (Independence Day totally doesn't count because he blows up more stuff than he kisses. That's the rule.) He's got the smooth-factor. His leading lady I could have done without. But she didn't kill it or anything. There were a few lines to which I objected (\\"I didn't mean to hurt you,\\" was one. She totally DID mean to hurt him!

6300214435|4.0|\\"Raiders of a lost ark\\" was a thrill. I mean the suspense was just brilliant and the story was packed with surprises. This movie is not like that at all. You don't get the excitement you did in \\"Raiders\\". What's more it's scary, and I mean almost disturbing. The ceremonial scene is creepy, the candles are freaky and it looks like this could really be happening somewhere in a dark place. The movie deals with truly disturbing adult themes such as evil, drug addiction, witchcraft, child abuse, and torture. In \\"Raiders\\" you knew it was just a story. However, the scare in \\"doom\\" is not so much \\"jumpy\\" like in \\"Raiders\\", it is an uneasy feeling that sticks to you as soon as you enter the horrible hell hole. The intorduction of the chinese kid brings a lot of fun but the woman is irassible, and Dr Jones not convincing as a possessed by evil Indiana. The idea that children are working as slaves is definitely not a funny one. The roller coaster rides however really add a tone to the movie, they are cool, but a few scenes are downright fake. For example, the scene where the ceiling with spikes comes down is so false: it looks like it 's only about two meters and as soon as it is close to them, Spielberg lifts it up again to give time to the woman. Another example, the crocodile scene obviously shot in different locations because when taken from profile it looks like Indiana and his goons are standing on a little bridge over a creek. The guru character was not an interesting one, and the image that this film gives on Indians is more of a political one rather than a mysterious one, and I don't like this image. <br /> <br />But,...the beginning of the movie is one of the best action thriller beginnings of all time and just for uhe first aprt up to the point where the trio arrive in India, the movie deserves to be watched.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The new Foo Fighters record is the record One by One could have been.  Don't get me wrong One by One was amazing, but many people bought that CD expecting that all the songs would have the same intensity of \\"All My Life\\". The rock portion of \\"In Your Honor\\" starts off fast and hard, but unlike One by One the album retains that intensity throughout the ten tracks. The strongest tracks on the CD are Best of You, DOA, Hell, Free Me and End over End. Dave Grohl at a concert I attended expressed his desire to play arena rock.  This CD is his answer because this album in itself would make an amazing set list.    <br />  <br />The acoustic album was actually better than what I expected though I admit that Virginia Moon is a good jazz song it just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the album.  The best track on disc 2 is Razor due to its haunting melody and lyrics. <br /> <br />  The Foo Fighters have made probably there most sold album to date.  Also, I think that with this album people may start to not look at Dave Grohl as the man who was in the shadow of Kurt Cobain, but as songwriter of equal talent and probably better talent when it comes to musical talent.  The copyright protection is a pain, but I will say that you can get the songs on your ipod.   <br /> <br />It's the best rock album I bought this year and I get chills thinking how amazing these songs will sound live. <br />

Though if you want a album to relax or sleep too, maybe this cd is for you.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napolean Dynamite is one of the better movies I've seen, but it is not viewed in everyone's eyes the same way.  Some find it hilarious and love the movie; others find it stupid and think it should be burned.  Either way, no one can argue that Napolean Dynamite is completely random.  From llamas named Tina to Chapstick, this movie certainly does cover many obscure items.  If you find it hilarious for a teenager to scream at a llama to eat some ham or for \\"sick jumps\\" that really aren't that sick, this movie is most definitely for you.  If not, then I suggest finding another movie.

0743487478|2.0|I continue to be amazed by the assertions made by Alfie Kohn with regards to parenting, competition, and schooling, (but not amazed in a good way). Again and again and again we are told by Kohn that \\"rewards\\" are harmful. As I have mentioned in another amazon review of his book Punished By Rewards, the use of rewards is only \\"harmful\\" under very contrived and unnatural circumstances (and by harmful, he means that using rewards will decrease \\"intrinsic\\" motivation to do something and that the person on the receiving end of the reward may \\"feel bribed\\").<br /><br />Unlike Kohn's assertions, however, rewards can in fact help each of us live more satisfying and productive lives when used effectively. There is an exhaustive review of the research literature regarding the use of rewards that backs up this last statement. The book is called Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation: Resolving the Controversy and it is authored by Cameron and Pierce. Unlike Kohn, these authors review for the readers ALL the relevant research studies on the issue of using rewards, not just those that support a personal thesis. Unfortunately, this is the danger with non-peer reviewed books of the popular type Kohn writes: the author can pick and choose which studies to present to make a point without paying any attention to those that contradict that point (and there are MANY that contradict Kohn's assertions--see the Cameron and Pierce book above). While case studies about his own children may convince certain readers of the usefulness of Kohn's approach, I await peer-reviewed evidence. The shelves of bookstores are already awash with enough pseudoscience about what makes children tick; Kohn's book just adds to the puddle.<br /><br />I gave this book 2 stars because I do agree with Kohn's goals about parenting. Reading the book will certainly support my view that they are noble aims. Given the lack of research support, however, Kohn does not have much of a leg to stand on as to how to best achieve those aims. I would like to suggest that other readers take a look at The Power of Positive Parenting by Latham for a set of parenting techniques that have a great deal of research backing their use.<br /><br />We owe it to our children to parent them effectively.ld like to suggest that other readers take a look at The Power of Positive Parenting by Latham for a set of parenting techniques that have a great deal of research backing their use.

It's fun, it's frivolous, it's not meant to be taken seriously and that's why I love it.  Looking forward to her next book already!
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild is a book I needed to read for summer reading, as u can imagine I wasn't too excited.  Once I got into it and read a few pages in I was hooked.  Christopher's journey is one we can only imagine, most of us don't ever plan on doing the things he did. Jon Krakauer tells a story that is exciting and fun to share with everyone and anyone.  Jon leads you into this young mans journey that you will never forget.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Im from the uk and waited for ages for the film to come out on dvd! When i got it i was so pleased! Samuel Jackson was just fabulous in it! Also Rick Gonzalez who plays Timo Cruz was just amazing, especially in the scene when he got emotional i was very touched! The film had an unexpected twist at the end, but was still beautiful, and the bit when it tells you about what happened to all the players you couldn't help but cry and feel very proud! I would definately buy dis film, if u havent already!!!!!!! xxxxxx
0833509454|5.0|IT is not just a horror story about an evil clown, it's mainly about the characters.   <br /> <br />Bill Denbrough lost a little brother to IT.  This is what causes his stutter.  And King goes into terrific depth in explaining Bill's home life; his parents never laugh at a joke, whenever they see one of George's (Bill's brother) belongings, they cry, and there's always a sense of emptiness at his house.  It makes you understand the characters. <br /> <br />Mike Hanlon is a kid who suffers from cruel racism at the hands of Henry Bowers and his gang.  Henry also kills his dog.  This aspect of the book demonstrates just how terrible prejudice is, and believe me, I got so ticked off at Henry Bowers while reading this--and he's just a book character. <br /> <br />Eddie Kaspbrak is a short, weak kid.  His mom worries over him far too much, she doesn't want him to have any friends other than her, and she confuses him into thinking he has asthma.  Later on he breaks through this unfair grasp, as he becomes more aware.  He even demosntrates how strong a character he really is later on. <br /> <br />Richie Tozer?  He just won't SHADDUP.  He's a very hyperactive kid that won't shut his mouth when he should.  He constantly makes his friends mad (though they forgive him, of course), and makes Henry Bowers MADDER.  Although he is a likeable character.  But sometimes, he keeps secrets from his friends. <br /> <br />Beverly Marsh is a girl that has a VERY tough homelife.  She uses whatever opportunity she can to escape.   <br /> <br />Ben Hanscom is an overwheight kid, but is really cool.  he helps the gang build their own dam in the Barrens, and helps them in other ways, too. <br /> <br />Stanley Uris is the kid with the brains; he relies solely on logic and understanding of basic principles, though he is not too brave when it comes to facing IT. <br /> <br />Together, these kids form a band determined to conquer IT.  And they do, for a while. <br /> <br />Enough about the characters.  The book flows very smoothly; it hops back and forth between childhood memories and their life as adults.  This made it easy to understand. <br /> <br />A big factor of this book is the fears of the 7 kids; they're afraid of whatever It is for a reason.  King chose It to represent a clown because that is a common childhood nightmare...but the 7 kids' individual fears make you, yourself afraid of them when reading.  I won't tell you what they are, because this is supposed to be a spoiler-free review.   <br />That's all that needs to be said.  No matter how many people told you that this is a cheesy horror tale, guess again: its main focus is characters and how they relate to real-life people.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I want to go back to the Best Buy clerk who introduced me to this album and kiss him (platonically of course).  Completely ignorant of anything Ryan Adams had done before, I came to this album free from anything other than a desire to not waste my money.  I wasn't disappointed. The music is absolutely beautiful, the lyrics are well-written, and the album hasn't left my CD player in several days. That's rare for me.  It is definitely the best album I've purchased in quite some time.  Highly recommended.
0446677450|1.0|Before I go on, I should point out that if you read the reviews ordered from \\"lowest rated first\\", one thing becomes clear. The lowest rated reviews are the most detailed and useful while the highest rated are mostly fluff and useless. It is likely that those are fake reviews by Kiyosaki affiliates. If there is one lesson I learned from reading the book and now all the reviews, it is to ALWAYS order them from lowest rated first and read in that order. Never depend on the average review rating. NEVER!    Now on to my review...    I do agree that if you do nothing but work and spend all your money, this book can really wake you up and motivate you to think about setting aside money and investing it in money earning/growing assets. This is good thing. But beyond that, the book paints a fantasy for the ignorant that being able to make money without working for it is very attainable even if you aren't rich to being with.    It is true that the truly rich don't need to work for a living, they can simply live off of assets that generate income. However the thing to note here is that unless you're going to inherit said assets or win the lottery, you're likely to have to first work hard to build up those assets or the wealth needed to buy those assets.    This of course isn't exactly some great \\"secret\\"!    Sure if I have 2 million dollars cash, I can buy 5% AAA rated bonds and live off of the $100000/year interest without working whatsoever. But wait a minute, how do I make that 2 million to be able to do that?    It is of course possible to get money to buy various assets (securities, real-estate, etc) through borrowing. But of course that money isn't YOURS its BORROWED and you have to PAY IT BACK PLUS INTEREST. It is usually not possible to borrow money and then put it in some passive, low-risk investment with returns higher than the loan payments themselves. You could of course borrow a bunch of money, gamble it on securities, forex, futures trading, sports-betting, or real estate and hope your bets pay off but this is as much a way to wealth as it is a way to bankruptcy and financial ruin.    Of course you could borrow that money and invest in a business. However a couple of points to note:    1. If said business is one you are starting from scratch, you'll have to WORK HARD to make that business successful and there's no guarantee you'll be better off quality-of-life wise and financially than if you WORK as an employee. In either case, you're WORKING for your money not living off of an asset passively. Maybe eventually you'll build up the business to the point where it runs itself and you can retire and live off of it and laugh at all those wage earning suckers. OTOH maybe you'll work yourself to death trying to make a business work that ultimately fails and end up penniless while the ordinary wage-earner \\"sucker\\" quietly amasses a nice fortune in his 401k, IRAs and such over time. One never knows but the record of business successes and failures speak for themselves.    2. If you are buying an already successful business with great cash flow that can run itself, then you're likely going to have to pay an amount proportional to how successful that business is. Unlike Kiyosaki's fantasy world, that successful business owner that worked hard to build that business isn't going to be an idiot and give away that business to you at a steal of a price. If you built and owned such a business, are you going to practically give it away to somebody else or are you going to sell it for what's its worth?    So you'll have to pay a lot of money obviously for a successful business that is at the point where it runs itself. But if you had the money to buy such a business, it means you were already rich to begin with.    The bottom-line is that in order to accumulate assets so that you can retire and live off those assets, you have to first WORK to create those assets or else the wealth to buy said assets. No one is going to give you those assetsfor free or at a bargain price despite Kiyosaki's fantasy notions that this is somehow possible. IRL there are no short cuts to success only hard work mixed in with good luck.
B00005JMYI|3.0|I generally have two reactions to Will Ferell movies either I fall out laughing hard or wonder why did he do this movie, Well Anchorman is a very funny romp through the 70's (the decade that bad taste in clothing begat)as a sexist but charming Anchorman who falls in love with Veronica Corningstone a ambitious female reporter (Christina Applegate who's becoming the Myrna Loy of our generation)after she joins the station in hopes to improve \\"diversity'. With dialouge that people will be quoting years  for years afterward. It's a good movie for laughs and the cameo appearances from Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller and others and the outright silliness It's a good escape movie.
0375703764|5.0|While occasionally self-indulgent and difficult to follow, this is a relentlessly fascinating experimental powerhouse from Danielewski. It's a manic-depressive and obsessive-compulsive approach to the act of writing, as well as the deliberate layering and layout of ideas. Multiple non-linear realities nearly crush the reader's mind, and the audaciously visual layout of the text is a trip. The narrator Johnny Truant has helped clean out the apartment of a old deceased gentleman named Zampano, who had apparently spent years and years researching an underground movie that supposedly documented a Lovecraftian interdimensional haunted house. Truant next spends years of his own organizing Zampano's obsessive research, learning that the movie probably doesn't exist (at least in this reality) and the events it documents probably didn't happen, though the whole endeavor somehow brings a supernatural madness to Truant as it did to Zampano. This novel is so full of hidden clues, inside information, and shifting realities that I'm not surprised there's a cult devoted to analyzing the dark depths of Danielewski's ideas.<br /><br />I also noticed an intellectual strain to this novel that I don't think too many other reviewers have caught. To truly see this, you would have to be a disillusioned graduate student who found the educational endeavor to be little more than stultified intellectual obtuseness. Here we find that Zampano has overanalyzed the mysterious film with vast and voluminous obscure references that are a sheer parody of the university intellectual method, with its detached and condescending armchair over-analysis, big statements on miniscule phenomena, and sycophantic name-dropping. Danielewski has also made use of obtuse intellectual abstractions that you would only ever hear professors talking about, such as semiotics, epistemology, and plenty of other postmodern gibberish, as the haunted house embodies the bizarre madness that would ensue if such egghead concepts physically existed (in whatever reality). As an unsatisfied ex-grad student myself, I found Danielewski's running brain-drain parody here creepingly hysterical. Add to that the book's general observations on death, mental illness, and perceptions of reality, and we have a rollicking, careening brainmelter. This is surely a difficult and even exasperating read, but it will probably lodge itself in your mind for a long time to come. [~doomsdayer520~]ts physically existed (in whatever reality).

B0001WTVUW|4.0|I hadn't seen this movie since it was played on TV in New Zealand about 15 years ago, but I was always shocked at how real the events were portrayed. The graphics obviously aren't up to our current standards, but I never forgot how chilling it was to watch when I was a 17 year old.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|One of the great film noirs of all time. Joan Crawford is in her element as the long suffering mother of a rotten child who drips with contempt for her mother's job as a waitress. I could go on about this movie, but everyone who has heard of it or seen it can attest to its story of hard working mother trying her best to please her spoiled daughter to the point of divorcing her husband to ensure her ownership of a restuarant. Then her second marriage to a penniless and money grubbing twerp who thinks nothing of seducing her daughter, and of course exhausting all means including body and soul just to win the affections and respect from her ungrateful, ruthless daughter. My only complaint is what's with the shoddy cardboard cases? Warner Brothers thinks this is a  good way to honor their star?  Or are they too cheap to fork over the 50 cents for a sturdy, plastic case?  All my movies from warner's from excalibur to billy jack to a cheap copy of Gone with the Wind is given the same ho-hum treatment. Shame on them! Mildred Pierce deserved better! Even 1.00 movies get better.

0800177177|4.0|I just got done watching this film for the first time and I was very impressed. Keanu Reeves was pretty bad, but not as dreadful as some other reviewers have claimed. Of course the acting heavyweights, Gary Oldman as Dracula (young and old) and Anthony Hopkins deliver the strongest performances by far. I also loved the fact that the music, make-up, costumes, and set design made you feel like you were really in this dark world. I rented and returned this movie, but I already want to see it again. I gotta pick this one up for my DVD collection.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Great movie. It's another great starring Errol Flynn. Truly a Classic.
B000001FCB|5.0|I own several Jobim LPs/CDs. I love them all. This CD, however, was my first real intro to Elis Regina. I had heard her once or twice on Brazillian compliations, never on her own album. This CD is the highest artistry. The songs, the arrangements, the chemistry, the singing -- 360-degrees beautiful. <br /> <br />

I'm sure that you will be impressed in this story.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Truly brilliant album!!! Impeccably jumping from style to style,-tribal, funk, hip-hop, soul etc & they are fully adept at each!  Multi-layered mayhem thats strung together perfectly...   <br />2 points i need to make: <br />*The first rapping on Lets Get Retarded says \\"in this context, theres no disrespect\\"- the peas are still as socially conscious as ever!!! <br />*Before this album they were without 'Fergie' the female vocalist, and their older albums were great- but with Fergie they have added a whole new dimension, & she sings with such passion- she literally sends shivers down my spine!!!  <br />A lot of people have been dissing Fergie, saying she made them 'pop'- just cos the general populous finally gives them a listen, don't mean they're sellouts, & Fergie is an extremely talented vocalist with a brain & a good heart -that's why she became a Pea!!!  <br />If you like the songs you've already heard, you should like the rest, they devote equal attention to each song. <br /> <br />BEST SONGS i reckon: LETS GET RETARDED (crazy enegetic song), HEY MAMA (groovy), SHUT UP (passionate  & sexy), SMELLS LIKE FUNK (crazy funky check out the lyrics ha ha), LATIN GIRLS (latino slow/fast), FLY AWAY (my absolute favourite I LOVE FERGIE!!!), THE APPL SONG (tribal/hip-hop), THIRD EYE (beautiful tribal sound bonus track) -in other words most of the songs!
0451191153|5.0|I've heard of Ayn Rand for years, never read her in high school or college and found myself in a rut of reading non-fiction (educational perhaps but ultimately uninspiring in the godlike way). I kicked off my new plan to read more fiction with The Fountainhead and could not have made a better choice. This is a book that I had always feared would be long, dry, \\"good for you\\" - but au contraire!  As a writer and television producer the struggles of Roark and the lethargy of Keating really struck home and made me consider many of my own artistic challenges in a commercial world.  The book reads like a good screenplay - fast, furious, and unforgettable.  I found myself reading only a page or two at the time as the book came to an end, because I had grown so familiar and happy to have these characters in my life and informing my own humanity through their actions and choices. <br /> <br />Life changing? I suppose so - I find myself thinking often of Howard Roark and Peter Keating (though not so much of Dominique Francon - her character is surprisingly the least human/developed in the novel, surprising considering that Ayn was a lady). <br /> <br />I've also never heard the concept of humanism expressed this way before - it turns the accepted idea of \\"good humans\\" as those that \\"do unto others\\" on it's head and makes you realize that if we are all truer to our core selves, we wouldn't need \\"doing unto-ing\\". <br /> <br />Read it. You'll love it.
B000002AZ8|5.0|I love this CD, but I'll admit that's it's not PJ's best. This disc has the hits, has the memorable songs...basically has everything. But it lacks the flow of such PJ classics as Vs. and No Code. For instance, going from Nothingman to Whipping wasn't the best choice. Or going from Not For You to Tremor Christ. It just doesn't seem like they cared too much about the song order. With that being said, I shall also mention that there's two songs I felt shouldn't have been included on here. Those two songs being Aye Davanita and Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me. PJ is, in my book, the masters of closing out a CD. I need not mention Ten's closer Release, or Vs. closer Indifference. Going out with Foxymophandlemama seems like they took the easy way out. I know following up a song such as Immortality isn't easy, but they should've put forth more effort than this. Oh well.<br /><br />As I said, this CD has the memorable songs, Not For You, Tremor Christ, Corduroy, and Immortality. But they start as unconventionally as you possibly can with Last Exit. This should've been the last song in my book. It's a great song though. Tremor Christ, one of the songs that introduced me to PJ, is included as well. This ranks among my favorite songs by them. It's not heavy, it has a very consistent tone straight through to the end of the song, which is when it climaxes. Satan's Bed is a nice song, one of the songs that doesn't seem like it fits, but it's worth the awkwardness at first. Immortality is probably the best songs on here. With sensitive lyrics that could strike a chord with anyone, and having some killer guitar cuts by Mike, you cannot go wrong.<br /><br />Basically, it's a CD of hits and misses, but in the end it's still a five-star effort in my opinion. While I still love Ed's voice, this is the last disc he seemed to really be trying on. A few of my favorite songs are Last Exit, Not For You, Tremor Christ, Corduroy, and Immortality. I bought this CD used at a local CD shop, but listening to it now, I would most definitely buy it at the retail price any time. \\"Worth every penny\\" is a saying that seems to ring true to this release.but listening to it now, I would most definitely buy it at the retail price any time. \\"Worth every penny\\" is a saying that seems to ring true to this release.

0739308688|5.0|The cassette recording of G.R.R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is an excellent rendition of an outstanding novel.  The reader's voice is effective, yet not overbearing.  And as is always the case with Martin, the story is top notch.<br /><br />If you don't have time to read the hard copy, I recommend the audio cassettes.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is the most awesome acoustic soul album I've ever listened to.  I listen to it as I'm going to sleep and I listen to it when I first wake up.  I listen to it in my car.  I tag it along like a dog on a leash everywhere I go.  She has a beautiful silky voice and her guitar work is the best I've ever heard in a long time.
B000002BBY|5.0|Over the last 11 years, the Gallagher brothers have had their ups and downs in the world of popular music, whether it be in the recording studio or the public media spotlight. Through it all, the two remain the only remaining members of the original quintet that made up Oasis. Regardless of whose surrounded them, Noel always seems to find a way to compose masterpiece after masterpiece, showcased with cathcy guitar riffs, and Liam's destinctive vocal delivery. While many make a case for 'Definitely Maybe,' I've listened to friends make a case for the originiality and shear listening pleasure of other albums such as 'Be Here Now' and 'The Masterplan.' While the more enthusiastic Oasis fan would tend to appreciate every one of the band's releases, it's 'What's the Story? Morning Glory' that put Oasis on the map. This truly is a PERFECT album. Songs like 'Wonderwall' and the epic 'Champagne Supernova' are instantly recognizable to most pop fans worldwide, but the very best of Noel's musical genius is found in the hard-rocking guitar fills in 'Some Might Say,' and the passive lyrics of 'Cast No Shadow.' Even the filler untitled ditties (although one of them is also known as 'The Swamp Song') add their own unique touch in leading up to the next big listening enjoyment. In my mind, this is not only Oasis' best album, but ONE OF THE BEST BRITISH POP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!

B0007TKNL0|3.0|The opening sequence alone is worth the price of this DVD! The original overture is already a very powerful music piece. Adding the CGI morphing & the whole sequence transcend into THE powerful & magical sequence in the history of cinema (my humble opinion).  <br /> <br />I think Emmy Rossum is the best Christine since Sarah Brightman. Like Christine herself, this was the first major role for Rossum. So the film successfully captured her freshness, uncertainty, immature yet innocent technique, both in her role as Christine as well as her own feeling.  <br /> <br />If I like this film so much, why do I give only 3 stars? One word \\"Phantom\\"! While Emmy Rossum is the best Christine, Gerard Bulter IS THE WORST PHANTOM! I fast forward all the scene with the \\"Phantom\\" solo because Gerard Bulter cannot sing! Even I can sing better then him! I believe there must be other actors in the world who can sing better, act better & good-looking. Why on earth choose one who cannot sing?! Gerard Bulter almost single-handedly destroy this film, if not the excellent performance of Emmy Rossum & other supporting cast save the day.  <br /> <br />At the end, do I recommend this film? Yes, the magical overture, the beautiful set, the voice of Miss Rossum, etc. all add up to one of the best musical movie in recent years. It is a pity that \\"the Phantom\\" cannot live up to his role.
B00005RDSM|3.0|I was glancing at the other reviews and noticed some reviewers wondering what became of the missing scene in which the audience is asked if they believe in faeries.  The fact of the matter is this scene, which was vital to the original play, was purposely omitted by Walt Disney is his animated version.  In fact, when the Disney version appeared in 1953, many reviewers who were great fans of the Barrie play complained about this, among them, Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, and Herbert Brenon, a British director who made a very popular silent film version of Peter Pan in 1925.  Why would Disney do this?  Crowther speculated that Disney assumed that Americans were more literal minded in 1953 than their British counterparts were in 1904 (when the play was first staged), and so wouldn't buy into all that faerie stuff.  Also, Crowther sardonically added that perhaps Disney was afraid that Americans would find it simply too embarrassing to deal with too much \\"pixiness.\\"  Go figure.  Anyway, that's the story behind the missing scene.
B000063DGC|5.0|Randy Rhoads, although only having two studio albums under a major label to showcase his amazing talent, was one of the greatest guitarists ever to play. Born in 1956 in Los Angeles, he began playing the guitar at around age seven. In 1976 he founded the first of the hair metal bands, Quiet Riot. Although they were only signed to a record label in Japan they became a hit amongst the LA club scene. In 1979, Quiet Riot lost Rhoads to ex-Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne. With Ozzy, Randy produced two multi-platinum studio albums until his untimely death in a plane crash on March 19, 1982. Five years later, Ozzy released a slew of live tracks from the Diary of a Madman tour, the Tribute album. Track ratings:<br />1) I Don't Know- 8/10-  Catchier than the studio version, nicely added pentatonic riffs and harmonics, and a vastly improved solo.<br /><br />2) Crazy Train- 10/10- Slighty heavier than the studio version, and a little more upbeat. One of the best tracks on the disc.<br /><br />3) Believer- 7/10- ties with (Steal Away) The Night for worst track on the CD, although it's still entertaining. It has a decent bassline and is slightly slower than most of Ozzy's songs.<br /><br />4) Mr. Crowley- 10/10- Another of the best tracks on the disk, it features two of Randy's best solos. Overall better than its studio counterpart.<br /><br />5) Flying High Again- 9/10- I actually like the album version of this song better, although the solo is better on the live version. Poison's \\"Nothing but a Good Time\\" is an almost exact ripoff of this song, and if you like that song, you'll definitely like this.<br /><br />6) Revelation (Mother Earth)- 10/10- One of the best songs Ozzy ever recorded, this song escalates into one of Randy's best solos. One of the best tracks on the CD.<br /><br />7) Steal Away (The Night)- 7/10- so. catchy. Features an over- extended 4 minute drum solo. The song itself is decent, although<br />it does not compare to the others.<br /><br />8) Suicide Solution-11/10- Randy's finest 7 minutes and 46 seconds. This is the best version of the song, and the bridge is extremely catchy and may get stuck in your head. At the end of the song, Randy plays a jaw-dropping unaccompanied and improvised guitar solo that lasts over two minutes. This is one of the many reasons why Randy has been idolized by so many guitarists in the past twenty years.<br /><br />9) Iron Man- 9/10- Gets extra points because this overrated song was shortened. Randy makes it more interesting and less repetitive with the addition of vibrato and harmonics. The song jumps into the best version of Children of the Grave ever recorded.<br /><br />10) Children of the Grave- 11/10- Although it doesn't have an improvised solo, this track is just as good as Suicide Solution and much MUCH better than its original Black Sabbath version. It has one of the best solos I have ever heard, and is a melancholy reminder of what Randy Rhoads could have done if he hadn't died so early.<br /><br />11) Paranoid- 10/10- The best version of paranoid earlier. The guitar part is expanded so it is not as primitive as its original release, and features a nice solo.<br /><br />12) Goodbye to Romance- 9/10- The first song Randy wrote with Ozzy, and the last he performed. Much better than the studio version.<br /><br />13) No Bone Movies- 8/10- One of the most upbeat and heavy songs on the album. The rating would be higher except Ozzy's vocals are barely distinguishable.<br /><br />14) Dee- 1000000/10- you get to hear him speak!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the guitar is much clearer sounding than in the studio version.

Similar quotations appear in Luke's and Mark's Gospels.<br /><br />Barabasi does mention Jesus in his book, but only in the context that Christianity became so successful not because Jesus was son of God, but because Paul craftily spread it through his social networks.<br /><br />I think that scientists should stop this vanity of vanities and read the Bible.
B000003BEM|5.0|This is, perhaps, The Rolling Stones' masterpiece. After the disaster that was \\"His Satanic Majesty's Request\\" the band clearly decided to stop slavishly copying trends (and, one might add, following in The Beatles' footsteps).  <br /> <br />Brian Jones appears only sporadically, it's his last album with the band. The Stones brought in Jimmy Miller to produce, after having learned the hard way that they work best when they have someone besides Mick and Keith at the mixing board. Nicky Hopkins' contribution to this album can't be understated. Rumor has it that Ry Cooder participated in the sessions. <br /> <br />\\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" kicks things off. For an inside look at the evolution of this iconic song see Jean Luc Godard's \\"One Plus One\\" (aka \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\"). This song was scary and groundbreaking back in 1967 - now that we've all heard it 1,000+ times it seems far too familiar. In my opinion this is one of Mick's best lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"No Expectations\\" is a beautiful song, with lovely piano work by Hopkins. The lyric is a bit trite, but it works. Believe it or not this was the first single - it's perhaps the weakest song on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Dear Doctor\\" is really, really funny. The Stones were fans of country music, but here they take on the form as a cliche. \\"For the gal I'm to marry / Is a bow-legged sow / I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge.\\" This is a hoot. <br /> <br />\\"Stray Cat Blues\\" - another reviewer stated that this is a homage to fans of the band. Jeez, I hope not! This is very creepy stuff. Mick's growls in the intro are absolutely filthy (\\"Yeah, just don't care...\\"). He sings this like an utter pervert, which is the point. \\"Well I can see that you're 15 years old / But I don't want your ID.\\" By now it's obvious to the listener that The Stones have reinvented themselves - where did this sound come from? It's unlike anything we've heard on previous Stones albums.  <br /> <br />\\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" - many fans don't care forthis song. It's a bit of a throwback, somewhat reminiscent of \\"Something Happened To Me Yesterday\\" and a few others from the previous incarnations of the band. Mick's lyric is a bit overwritten, but the final verse in particular is quite good. The band jams out well here - Keith, Wyman and Hopkins play off one another brilliantly, particularly in the coda. It's a fine side-ender. <br /> <br />\\"Street Fighting Man\\" - some of this was recorded in a living room. The basic drums are Charlie banging on telephone directory books. Some of the guitars were recorded on a cheap tape deck. The sitar is Brian; more amazing Hopkins piano here. This was, I believe, the start of Keith using the famous \\"open G\\" tuning he has employed since. A solid song, but I've always thought it a bit over-rated. <br /> <br />\\"Prodigal Son\\" - country blues, based on the Bible story. Mick's lyric is perfect, as is his vocal delivery. No contemporary British band could sound as authentically American when doing this style of blues. <br /> <br />\\"Parachute Woman\\" - more blues, but now we move from the Delta to the Big City. Bill Wyman has often referred to this is his all-time favorite Stones track. The sound is (purposefully?) muddy, and it feels perhaps a bit off-hand at first listen - but give it a chance. This is powerful stuff.   <br /> <br />\\"Factory Girl\\" - an underrated gem. It's a beautiful song with a lilting melody, a fun yet poignant lyric, and a wonderful performance by all. \\"Waitin' for a girl who's got stains all down her dress / waitin' for a girl and my feet are gettin' wet / she ain't come out yet / waitin' for a factory girl\\" - that's as fine a depiction of working class life as I've yet come across.  <br /> <br />\\"Salt Of The Earth\\" - the first verse is Keith Richard's first lead vocal on record. This is a stirring song, an apt followup to \\"Factory Girl.\\" I wasn't at all surprised that this was a song Mick and Keith chose to perform at \\"The Concert For NYC.\\" The vamp in the last1/3 or so of this song is brilliant musicianship. <br /> <br />If one is familiar with The Rolling Stones only as a \\"hit\\" group, this album could be disappointing - there's no obvious Top Ten hit here. But if you appreciate music, and if you know anything about the history of this group, you will appreciate the fact that this was a groundbreaking album.  <br /> <br />There isn't a bad track here. Each is brilliant in its own way. And, of course, this was the first of five great albums produced by The Stones - \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" \\"Let It Bleed,\\" \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and \\"Exile On Main Street.\\" They had never before reached these heights - and never would again. <br /> <br />The Rolling Stones are regarded by most fans and critics as contemporaries of The Beatles and Bob Dylan (\\"The Holy Trinity\\" of the 60's) on the strength of the five albums noted above. They had a lot of hits before \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" but if that was all they'd done they would be regarded as equals to The Animals or The Yardbirds, etal. They became rock royalty when they produced \\"Beggar's Banquet.\\"
0670033375|2.0|After a stunning book with \\"Guns,..\\", I guess I was bound to be disappointed.  What made his previous book so amazing was a fresh way to analyze the history of men through the impact of geography.  This time, while he does bring about a myriad of interestings facts, his conclusions are unconvincing.  His main anecdotal evidence is from remote fragile environments, from which any extrapolation is tenuous at best.  He tries to overcome this weekness by analyzing a couple of larger countries, but again, the conclusion seems forced, like fitting a square peg in a triangle slot.  Political, historical and social reasons would seem to outweigh the environmental reasons of collapse.  He acknowledges the impact of these reasons, but insinuates more than demonstrates the importance of environment.  The weakest point was his 11 environmentally strained countries related to the same 11 countries with political problems.  Which came first, the political problems which led to enviromental problems, or the other way around?  I recognize that no labarotory experimentation is possible when analyzing societies, but a good falsifiable approach would bring him a long way towards greater credibility.
B00068NVI4|5.0|O.k, so I went to one of the shows on this tour. It was one of the funnest concerts I've been to in a long time. I've been waiting for the DVD, but only as a momento of the tour since I was extremely disappointed in the Symphonic Yes DVD (I make myself watch it now and then, but it just doesn't cut it- very lackluster performance). My expectations for this DVD were quite low (hopeful- but I was ready to be disappointed again). Well I was quite pleasantly surprised! This DVD is WAY better than Symphonic Yes! The stage presentation, the playing- so much better! I love this DVD!  I think my wife is sick of me playing it over and over. I agree that the sound is at times not perfect and that Jon's voice does overshadow the instruments at times- but this is live music- it isn't perfect. But it is definitely very enjoyable.  I won't go track by track- but the song selection is great. The ONLY disappointing thing about this DVD is that my all-time favorite Yes song- Awaken- was played at the show I saw (oh yes! It was GREAT!)but wasn't played/included at this show. Other than that- a minor complaint- the DVD is worth every penney. There is a ton of music here (nearly 3 hours!), great playing, great visuals. I'm really glad I bought this one!
B00005LMBK|2.0|Ill keep this short. If , like me , you got into Gorillaz because of 'Feel Good inc.' and hence got the Demon Days album.. then you will hate this album. Whether or not you see me as a 'proper fan' I couldnt care less, but 'Gorillaz' is a poor album. <br />Why? Im afraid its garbage in comparison. The beats are monotonous, lyrics weak and there is just no excitement in this record. <br /> Yes Im well aware that it was the first work of the Gorillaz band and obviously 4 years after its only obvious that they should create something better, but im reading all these positive reviews and its just not happening for me. <br />I gave it two stars based on 'Double Bass' ( The ONLY song that did anything for me ) and 'Rock The House' which was decent. <br />Many, regardless will get this for the sake of clarity, or like me, just to complete a bands collection because there is +30 GB still free on an mp3 player. You Hope im wrong. BUT im not. IF you got Demon Days first i swear on my life you will be disappointed with this. All I can say is that im glad i didnt get this album first, because it really is enough to put you off the excellant 'Demon Days'
B00005NI5Y|5.0|The ups and downs of one of the most amazing people in rock and roll come to yet another peak with LOVE AND THEFT. Bob Dylan came back from the dead, literally, on his death bed in '97 with TIME OUT OF MIND. The fans came around old and new with that record. The attention and the awards, too. It was good, but the same old themes were there. Heartbreak, death, fractured love. It was said to be on for the ladies. I guess with that we couldn't ever think it possible for Dylan to slip beneath the cracks again. In 2001 when this one came out, death was long behind him. This album is fresh, good fun. The lyrics have enough substance to keep you coming back again and again, and you will catch something new all the time. It's Dylan celebrating himself, which wouldn't work for everybody else, but it's a joy to hear him so pleased with his act. Smiles help the aging process Bob. Somebody must have finally let him know that. SHERYL CROW relesed MISSISSIPPI before Bob, however he did write the song. He does it way better justice too, SUMMER DAYS kicks off the heart of this package. The tone is set with this swing type number. I love \\"She said you can't repeat the past, I said what do you mean you can't of course you can.\\" The rest of this album rips into life in such a positive/sub positive way you'll be shakin' your brain to every beat. I constantly have to go back a couple of seconds just to hear him deliver single lines. \\"I'm not sorry for nothing I've done...\\" in HONEST WITH ME. \\"Feel like a fighting rooster/ better than I ever felt.\\" In CRY A WHILE. LONESOME DAY BLUES, FLOATER, HIGH WATER. The whole thing moves and is a real treat. Thank you Mr. Dylan, thank you for coming back to life again. I'm sure you'll live another 100 years or so and theres like fifty more falls and rises left in your career. Keep it up. When I'm that old I hope I age as well as Bob Dylan.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I've wasted more money before, but I'm still trying to remember when I wasted it more foolishly. <br />This has got to be the most obviously ridiculous snipe hunt in video history. While trying to be funny, it mostly succeeds in convincing the viewer that Hollywood is full of nothing but 'screaming-left-wing-liberals' who want to turn all the 'right-thinking conservative countries' (meaning, of course, the USA) over to North Korea, Iran, and Al Quaida.  <br />Now, I'm the first one to agree that there's a Hell of a large liberal minority in Hollywood. As a VFW Lifer, I'm the first one to agree that much of what comes out of Hollywood - even now, with the post-9/11 hysteria that has the US jumping every time a bus backfires - is VERY liberal, and very patriotism-bashing. <br />BUT, it's nowhere near as virulent as this farce would have us believe. AND, while I love what it does to Michael Moore, I'm not sure Alec Baldwin or Susan Sarandon are anywhere NEAR as evil, self-serving, or just-plain-gullible as these guys make them out to be. <br />I'm not even going to dignify some of the graphic 'puppet-sex' scenes any farther than I just have. <br />All in all? Go buy a hamburger, take one bite, and throw the rest in the garbage. It's a better use of your money.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I bought 2 copies, one for myself and one for our granddaughter. We took her with us on vacation this summer and all 3 of us had one rollickin' good time watching it. I don't recall 3 people of such diverse ages ever enjoying the same thing as much. <br /> <br />Here are a few highlights that tickle me to death: <br />   -Patty Hearst plays Traci Lord's mother. How deliciously bad can you get? <br />   -Great original songs include: <br />      Cry Baby <br />      King Cry Baby <br />      Doin' Time for Being Young (on my top 10 list for best rock song ever - best title for sure) <br />      Please Mr. Jailer (won't you let my man go free?) - probably no. 1 on my list for best rock song ever. Well, OK, \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" by Bob Dylan has it beat, but just barely. <br />   -Some quotes (there are way too many to write them all here): <br />      \\"I want to let you, Cry Baby, but I can't for my parents' sake. They're both dead.\\" <br />      \\"One single solitary tear is all They'll ever suck out of this Cry Baby.\\" <br />      \\"You mean you swapped me for a milk-maid?\\" - Traci Lords to her parents <br />      \\"Cry Baby, you're rehabilitated now. Here's $2.50 and a pair of clean underwear.\\" - the Judge to Cry Baby <br />      \\"Tight slacks - hysterectomy pants, I call them.\\" <br />      \\"This is only a drill, there are actually no Atom Bombs being dropped.\\" <br />      \\"Oh Wanda, you sure is pretty, in them tight clothes all painted up like trash.\\" - grandma Ramona Rickets to Traci Lords. <br /> <br />OK, I'm going home after work to watch it again. <br /> <br />                                           -Gospel Moody
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Great soundtrack!   We love it as a family. Our favorite song is popular!  Great Buy!
0451191153|5.0|Fountainhead is a story about one man's (Howard Roark, architect) struggle to maintain the integrity of his work and self against a society that tries to destroy him and his accomplishments by subscribing to a collective mentality of so-called altruism and selflessness. Roark pays again and again for his unyielding honesty and refusal to compromise. In time, he is sided with two allies who struggle with Roark until he is vindicated by his courage and truth. Rand's strong command of the English language allows for a story with characters whose dialogs waste no words in conveying their points. In his final trial, Howard Roark stands true to his self against a community ready to convict. In the end, Roark prevails through his brilliant self-representation, which defines the heart of Roark's (and Rand's) basic philosophy about individualism, courage and freedom.  Fountainhead is not just about Roark's struggle to maintain his integrity, rather it is Ayn Rand's implicit message about individualism versus collectivism and innovators versus second-handers.     Fountainhead is a long read but interesting through-and-through. This is a gripping story well worth the time.
B00005MP58|4.0|If you want to rewatch Pride & Prejudice on that cold, foggy night, curled up with a glass of good red wine, then this will do fine. If you expect a lot of extras and special features including outtakes and inside jokes, this DVD doesn't have it. It's not too fancy, and yes, as otheres have said the quality of the film is not there.
B00009ATIX|4.0|I have yet to view Tarkovsky's original Russian film of this title, nor have I read Lem's novel, so this brief review is judging Soderbergh's film on its own merits as a viewing experience.    Let me say right off the bat that Soderbergh's film is a feast for the senses and a respite for the psyche.  The art direction, set design, special effects, cinematography, and music score are all superb.  The script, acting, and direction do NOT belie common sensibilities as many reviewers I've read, both professional and amateur, seem to suggest.  The characters involved are \\"real\\" and are well-grounded in social, scientific, and psychological reality--with important exceptions which I won't divulge.  It's this \\"human\\" groundedness which makes the strange happenings on the space station orbiting Solaris so compelling.    The beautiful yet ominous face of the planet Solaris overhangs the proceedings as if it were the sword of Damocles.  Its presence is less of a mysterious shroud as much as an active interested observer, constantly peeking through the station's observation portals and visiting the minds of its visitors as they dream.  Initially, we're less interested in its scientific bases then in its machinations: Is it well-disposed or nefarious?  We can never really nail its intentions since those humans it affects seem themselves to determine how they are affected.  It's only later that we're engaged in the planet's scientific makeup as the station's crew plan a retreat to the familiar \\"human\\" machinations of Earth.    This is a film whose arc and rhythms are perfectly in tune.  The thoughtful and curious viewer is thoroughly engaged from beginning to end.  If there's one area left wanting it's that I wished it would have delved even deeper and more engagingly into the psyches of its two main characters (those of George Clooney and Natascha McElhone) and of the others on the space station both living and dead; i.e. the hows and whys of planet Solaris and its cosmic relationship to human existence.  I was left wanting more, which many would proclaim to be a sign of the film's success.  I have to agree, but it also left me wanting to see the original three-hour Russian film of this title to see if my wants would be further fulfilled.    By all means, do NOT feel obligated to view the added featurettes.  They are entirely antithetical to the spirit of this film and add absolutely nothing of value---they are worse than worthless.  I've viewed the DVD film twice and have not yet felt compelled to listen to the running commentary.  Somehow, any commentary would seem superfluous.
0060090367|5.0|Watermelon is a story about a 29-year old Irish girl who gives birth to a beautiful baby only to be told directly afterwards by her husband that he's leaving the both of them for the downstairs neighbor.  What a complete jerk!  I was immediately rooting for Claire, and just as depressed as she was.  What an amazingly horrible thing to happen, after such a miracle!  She's got a crazy family and I loved how Marian Keyes just lays it out for us, the dirt and the glory all together.  And how our life experiences mold us and actually prepare us to love certain people that come into our lives.  And how a single person's perspective of our personality can really throw our self esteem out the window. <br /> <br />\\"Watermelon\\" is really a beautiful, sweet, sappy, sad, exhilarating tale of losing our way and finding a better one.
B00005ASOI|4.0|After reading a lot of reviews for this film I was amazed at most of the latter reviews which bash this film. Obvioulsy those reviewers are stuck on American horror films which tend to deal with less story and cinematograhy and more on flat out T&A and violence.     Keep in mind this movie was released back in 1977 so the effects weren't nearly as good and to a \\"true\\" fan of the genre should not be as important as imagination, creativity and suspense in which \\"Suspiria\\" delivers in all 3 catagories. Simply put if you are more into American horror movies then you should probably not watch this film.     The recent reviews before mine are typical of those who enjoy \\"slasher films\\" (typical of the early 80's I.E. \\"Friday the 13th\\" (1980) or mid 90's flicks like \\"Scream\\" or \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" I'm not taking anything away from those films as they're fantastic in their own right. \\"Suspiria\\" is a matter of taste and opinion. There is no middle ground, either you'll love it or hate it. I am one that loves it. I would recommend this film to those who either 1) Love the Italian Giallo movies or 2) have an open mind when it comes to different horror styles.     If you feel movies like the above mentioned \\"Friday the 13th\\" and \\"Scream\\" are the best of the genre (You have a lot to learn) and you should NOT watch \\"Suspiria\\" it's not for you.
0385338686|4.0|This book is entertaining from start to finish. If you liked Sophie's other books you'll like this one too. Samantha is quite outrageous but that's what makes her so endearing and this book so enjoyable. I can't wait for Sophie's next book.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Wow.  That's all I can say about this Special Edition DVD.  I will bag the review of the movie.  It's been done millions of time.  Just wanted to put my two cents in about this particular edition. <br /> <br />The transfer is beautiful.  The extra minutes added to the film are a wonderful surprise.  This edition comes with a nice little booklet and some miniature posters.  A real bonus that you don't often get with something like this.  The special features included with the DVD are very well done and were just about as enjoyable to me as the actual movie. <br /> <br />You can't go wrong here folks.  This price is easily the best DVD edition of any movie I have purchased so far. <br /> <br />If you like this movie, don't hesitate buying this version.  It's flat out superb.  I wish more producers would take the time and extra effort.
B00096S49O|3.0|I was a bit skeptical about watching this movie because I had heard it was a \\"chick flick\\".  Not that there's anything wrong with that!  Well, there wasn't.  Hitch was great and the pairing of Kevin James and Will Smith was surprisingly good.  I think Kevin James steals the show with his dance scene and overall hilarious acting, but Will Smith does make it funny as well.  The storyline got a bit weak at times, but there's only so many ways you cn try to camoflauge the \\"boy meets girl, boy and girl like each other, boy messes up, boy and girl patch things up and live happily ever after\\" storyline.  I never stopped laughing, which was the most important part, so it was well worth the time devoted to a pretty good \\"chick flick\\".<br /><br />As for the UMD format, I think I'm done exploring that avenue.  The DVD version of this movie is conciderably cheaper and can be watched on your home DVD system, a portable DVD system (which is way cheaper than a PSP) or other ways.  The UMD image quality was great; crisp and clean with out any glitches.  The sound, even with the \\"UMD volume\\" at +2, was barely audible when the actors talked at a normal level.  Forget whispers, which were a lost cause.  Headphones were the only way to go, and sometimes I just don't want to wear them.  The other issue I have was a lack of any extras.  The movie, and ONLY the movie for this price was asking an awful lot.  I know the format can only hold a certain amount, but other UMD's have offered a small but appreciated gag real or something.  Stick with DVD versions.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is the most informational DVD about a group yet. As always they perform their songs and tell about themselves very honestly.
1932100385|5.0|The critics will say this is just a book to support a vegetarian cause, but I've read several \\"vegetarian\\" books as well as books denouncing them.  Dr. Campbell arrives at all of his conclusions by giving the methods he used during the experiments as well as a mountain of scientific evidence to support his view.  The rat experiments in the beginning of the book are quite interesting considering many studies done with rats can be related to humans.  This gives a foreshadowing to things to come in the middle of the book.  The actual China Study that was done is a short section but doesn't need to be very long considering we really only need the results of the study.  There were several different areas that were tested during the study including blood tests, long questionairres, and village nutrient samples from their food.  Even specifics such as the different types of nutrients in the chinese people were measured in several different ways.  For example, iron was measured in 6 different ways, riboflavin was taken 3 different ways, and so on. Another nice aspect of the study was that around 90% of all of the individuals tested had been born in the county they were tested in.  <br /> <br />All of these factors are why the New York Times said it was \\"the most comprehensive large study ever undertaken of the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease\\". <br /> <br />On the more personal level, I also see that Dr. Campbell isn't in this for any kind of financial gain.  He himself was raised on a dairy farm handed down from ancestors.  If there was any reason for him to stick his neck out and do things against the status quo it would only be for the profit of humankind.  Great book!  Highly recommended.
0743454537|3.0|I enjoyed reading \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". It's the first Jodi Picoult book I read and it's made me interested in reading her other works. The book was simply written and it's interesting to obtain the story from multiple perspectives or voices. Many issues were explored and questioned and probed incisively, though I agree with some other reviewers that the ending is truly capricious and erratic. Overall, it's still a good read and the questions it asks are worthy of deeper thought and consideration.

My greatest enjoyment however is watching with the Henry IV subtitles \\"For those who don't like the movie\\".

B0000DBJDM|5.0|I am glad I now own this DVD. It gives me the best of both worlds: the Director's Cut together with the Original film. Both of them have features I enjoy. The new animation added in the director's cut enhances the experience, especially in songs like 'Set the Controls' where it takes you on that solar trip we Floyd fans have imagined for as long as we can remember. In the original (and complete) footage of Echoes Part 1, when the camera zooms in ever so slowly into the band playing Pompeii's ancient and empty coliseum, you are witnessing a young Floyd on the cusp of true greatness. If you are a Floyd fan, you will not--repeat--not be dissapointed.

Caligula... you know, no moral compass means i get confused.  i mean, i love slasher films, don't get me wrong, its just that they have right and wrong.  this film has a big production budget and design budget, and it tries to be like an episodic comic book -- pulp fiction????  i don't like any of the characters, bottom line.  end of story.  i'm out.  j.
B000001DV2|1.0|none for the rest.  I grew to like 'Hysteria', though I got rid of it a long time ago, and don't/won't listen to ear candy/drivel like this anymore.  I saw them on this tour, on 9/25/92 and on 7/8/93, both in Sacramento.  They were good shows, but not because this album had any quality to it.  They played 'Bringin' On The Heartbreak' at the first show, and 'Another Hit and Run' at the second show.  These, and some of the 'Pyromania' songs were the highlights of these shows.  This album was essentially the end of Def Leppard as the world had come to know them, but not because Mutt Lange parted ways with them.  By 1992, DL were dinosaurs because Nirvana, and all they stood for, obliterated hair bands forever, and made rock unfun.  Nirvana made it uncool to write songs that were essentially meaningless, and though DL wrote some good rock songs, when it comes down to it, they ARE meaningless, and so is/was their music.  Unfortunately, Nirvana was really the end of rock.  I'm not even a fan of Nirvana, but 'fun/dumb' rock looked stupid and pathetic after 'Nevermind' came out, and that's the way things have stayed since Kurt killed himself:  half parodies/tribute/cover bands (including bands still touring long after their heyday, e.g. The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones, etc.) and half new bands that are just rehashes of older (and better) stuff, pretending to be something they're not (I know because I just left LA and was in several bands that all fit this description).  The End Complete...

B0000D96NW|5.0|The first time I heard this cd, I admit, I was a little unimpressed, but I listened to it again, and I have no idea why I felt that way. Possibly the different sound of vocals that im used to. anyways, this cd hasn't gotten old even after 5 months of listening to it often! The lyrics are brilliant, the guitar is superb, the vocals-intense, drums are one of the best of this genre. they can be hardcore in some songs \\"like bite the bullet\\", but they can also be softer like in \\"descend the shades of night\\" and they still kick ass! \\"through the ashes of empires\\" made me want to hear and see more machine head!
B000003TA4|1.0|\\"It's laughable to think someone would place a lame band like Pearl Jam or Creed, with their ridiculous \\"yarling\\" vocalists, squeaky clean production, and trite, cliched songs, ahead of Nirvana.\\"    That's your opinion huh? - I think its RIDICULOUS someone would put Nirvana - with their repetitive guitar riffs, mostly meaningless lyrics, Pixies-ripoff persona, \\"we're mainstream but please respect us indie kids, we wont quit making music videos though LIKE PEARL JAM DID , but PLEASE respect us indie kids\\" attitude - Ahead of what USA TODAY readers recently named The Greatest American Rock Band of All Time...    Pearl Jam    ... and a few more things - you're just SO COOL dude for naming \\"EXTREME\\" bands you've gotten into.. I could name tons of indie bands, but i guess i dont care about looking as INDIE and COOL as you do...    And as far as the \\"essence\\" of rock n roll goes - If you call gaining much more popularity through suicide the \\"essence\\" of rock n roll, fine - but to me?  the esscence of rock n roll has always been \\"f--k you, im still here\\"... which Pearl Jam has, the Who has, Pink Floyd has, Neil Young and Bob Dylan have, Radiohead have and the Ramones had....    Which is what Nirvana didnt have.  ______________________________________________________________    Nirvana was a joke compared to Pearl Jam - Pearl Jam were light years ahead of those Pixies wannabes from the very beginning, and if Nirvana was still around today, Pearl Jam would still be lights years ahead of Nirvana - Nirvana was outdone by Pearl Jam every second, every song, every album, in every way possible until kurt blew his brains out... and that was before Pearl Jam's best material came.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I just listened to this album for the first time yesterday, and since I have listened twice more. The complexity of each song is completely astounding; the way it flows and every instrument harmonizes perfectly is so soothing, it almost seems simple if listened to casually. The album is heartbreaking and singular and upliftingly dreary. The emotion overflows from one song to the other and cresendoes in undulations. <br /> <br />This is one of the best albums I've ever listened to.
B0000019PA|5.0|Either you get it, or you don't.  Wonderfully infectious, or horribly grating depending on your perspective.  I guarantee you'll fit in one of the two categories.  I am happy to have this CD and happy to love it.  Thank God my husband gets it too!
B000AU9UYC|5.0|Batman Begins is in no way linked to the previous 4 movies in any way (and thank god, in my opinion). <br /> <br />The cast in the film is superb. Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. As many know, these are really two different parts because Bruce Wayne is really the fake, public persona wheras Batman is when Bruce Wayne shows his true identity. They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully. Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon - and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion. He is Batman's only friend and a great cop on a terribly corrupt police force in this movie, the way the character was meant to be. Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully. Liam Neeson is spectacular as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor. Cillian Murphy is twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever. And Morgan Freeman's performance is great  in the few memorable scenes he is in. Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gothams Assistant DA.  <br /> <br />As far as the plot goes - it is fantastic.Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot. The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.  <br /> <br />One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie. Gone are the ridiculous neon lights of Schumacher's movies and the extreme Gothic tone of Burton's. You really feel that Batman could exist in this Gotham City - even so much that this movie doesn't feel like a \\"superhero\\" movie,it feels like a man going out for revenge. It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie. <br /> <br />This movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great superhero movies.This film is by far the most realistic comicbook movie ever made.
6305949980|5.0|No complaints here.  One of the best stop motion films of our time. Looking forward to the sequel.
B00026WU7I|5.0|I said that with Bringing It All Back Home, I know, but my mind has changed.<br /><br />This is not a very pleasent album. After all, it was recorded shortly after a divorce, so what would you expect? Tangled Up in Blue is the best-known, and best, song here, a love song with plenty of clever wordplay. Simple Twist of Fate is about two outcasts and their relationships. Just why they are outcasts,<br /><br />I can't say (Not here, anyway) but it's still a moving song. You're a Big Girl Now is the resident heartwrenching ballad. Idiot Wind is eight minutes of pure RAGE. You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go is the only weak song, but it's clever enough to stay afloat. Meet Me in the Morning is a blues tune and the only electric one (bet that pleased the folkies.) Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts is a lengthy western tune that takes several listens to appreciate. If You See Her, Say Hello is another ballad that sort of reminds me of Girl From the North Country, complete with Bob's worst vocal performance to date. (He pronounces yellow, \\"yella\\" if you needed any proof). In an album-full of messed up lives, Shelter from the Storm stands out because of the simple-yet-hypnotic chord progression and how he takes Jesus and turns him into a man with a messed-up life seeking redemption. Buckets of Rain, the closer, is a very-underrated folk tune.<br /><br />Best Bob ever made. If you're reading this review and don't own Blood on the Tracks, drop everything and buy it. Then spend the day enjoying it and trying to catch it's deeper meanings. If you have to fake sick to get out of work or school, fake sick. It's that good.
B000067G3C|4.0|Though I may quibble with both Reeves and Hoppers performances (the first acts like scenery, while the second chews it), Speed was neither written nor directed as an actor showcase, thank goodness. Rather, its one long adrenaline rush with enough twists and turns to sustain its running time, and certain to keep action fans wide-eyed to the closing credits.
0316172324|5.0|Mr. Gladwell provides a very entertaining overview of gut feel decision making, and the efficacy of first impressions.  His analysis of a N.Y.C. shooting tragedy is fairly gripping and is a clear cautionary tale for those whose occupations require split second decisions, and of course particularly those of the life and death nature.    Mr. Gladwell also explains the work of scientists who have studied the myriad of human facial expressions.  I found this to be the most interesting segment of the book.  If you know anyone who is a superb communicator, touched on also in The Tipping Point, this work takes thinking about that talent to another level.  The amount of painstaking work required of those scientists who assembled the catalog/study of human facial expressions must have been daunting.    Those who dislike the book need to take it a bit less seriously.  While Gladwell treats very serious subjects, in the end, 'Blink' is really just good fun.
0790749815|5.0|Colorful, gripping entertainment for the whole family, and full of the trademark Master's twists and turns. Only Cary Grant could undertake this perilous journey and keep looking marvelous with no change of clothes. Eva Marie Saint is alluring as the icy blonde who may or may not be in his corner. But it's James Mason's unnerving performance that stays in your memory.
0765301598|2.0|[ NOTE: possible spoilers below}    -- the use of computers: HUGE flaw in the entire story, from the beginning.  Computers are outright banned.  Obviously, ships controls, communications, industry, and everything else requires complex computations only a computer could do.  Yet technology that could ONLY be computer-aided/controlled is used throughout the entire set of books.    -- The \\"satellite network\\" - what a joke!  I think the writers had a brain failure during this entire concept.  If the fleet knew of technology that could wipe out gelcircuitry, why wouldn't they use that technology at ground level to wipe them out there!?  Use that technology at ground level instead of having it just sitting idle in space!    -- If the network only destroyed gelcircuitry, why didn't the thinking machines just fire projectile explosives and destroy the satellites???    -- the fact that THOUSANDS of millions of humans had been sacrificed before in the extermination of the machine worlds, yet the most IMPORTANT battle of all came to a halt because of THREE million?  Billions of innocents were killed in less significant Synchronized Worlds before, but at the end, before the extermination of the most important world, the \\"command world\\" of the entire machine empire, humanity was going to stop their war because of 3 million innocents.  The writers try to say that that final situation was different, but didn't explain why.  Doesn't make sense!    -- the fact that they were willing to risk all of humanity's future existance because they didn't want to kill the Serena clone and her child (although they ignorantly believed they were the real people) - when their ENTIRE LEGACY of Serena was that she was a martyr!  ** someone who WILLINGLY sacrificed herself so that humanity could be free!  If they truly believed this, they would have KNOWN that Serena would have DEMANDED her sacrifice by the fleet in order to destroy the machines, and that by risking humanity's future by not killing her along with the machines would have been something she would have UTTERLY opposed!  It's like, they all revered her because she sacrificed herself for the future survival of her people, now they are risking EVERYTHING to allow that not to happen!  ARRRR!!!  For decades they worshipped her as someone who gave her life for them - but when given the chance to allow her death to ensure the final destruction of Omnius they don't take it!  -- although the writers DO hint to something related to this by saying \\"If Rayna truly believed that the spirit of Saint Serena had appeared to her in a fever vision, then how could she believe the real Serena was still alive?  It made no sense.\\"  But the writers just leave it at that!    .. these are just a small sample of the huge number of holes in the story.  I make it a personal point to read EVERY word in a book, and to go back and re-read a page if I found that by the end of it I didn't absorb it well enough, but this was the first book in the series I found myself skimming though parts.  I'm very disappointed that I read the entire series to have it the story fall apart at the end.  Mind you, the previous books in this series were not on the same level as Brian Herbert's writings - but I accepted that before I began them.  Basically I finished this book just so I could complete the series, put the dust cover back on, and have the full series looking nice on my bookshelf.    Maybe they'll make for better movies...
0792833201|5.0|This modern haunted house movie first generates feeling of dread, then sheer terror. Make no mistake-- this is one scary movie, particularly when seen for the first time. Well-paced and acted, Poltergeist delivers the horror goods. Not suitable for younger children.
0767020308|5.0|I've seen Emma with Gwynneth Paltrow!!  Oh, what a pitiful Emma Gwynneth made, she was pathetic!  Kate Beckinsale on the other hand is brilliant as Emma and this version of the novel is certainly the best of the two, just as the film Persuasion was a better film than Sense and Sensibility which I liked very much by the way but Persuasion was my favourite pick of the adaptions at the time. <br /> <br />Both 'Knightley' adaptions were wonderful.  I think Jeremy Northam and Mark Strong portrayed him wonderfully well and enjoyed both men in this part. <br /> <br />These two adaptions have their own good bits, although I didn't like \\"Paltrow\\" as Emma, I enjoyed other actors characterisations in that adaption and I will say it is also worth watching but \\"Jane Austen's Emma\\" is much closer to the novel I think and Kate is the better Emma, definitely.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Nothing is so potent as the truth. Under Lumet's expert direction, we see the established, shady practices in one of the country's largest police departments. Though set in a police department, it could happen anywhere, since the story is universal: man against machine, David against Goliath, the peculiar bravery of one man going up against a large, insidious opponent. One of Pacino's best early roles.
B00000AFHM|4.0|I had heard of this album and band from Glasgow, Scotland for a long time before I finally acquired my own copy.  I usually think that if there are 2 or 3 really good songs on an album, then it's successful.  \\"The Boy With the Arab Strap\\" certainly qualifies.  \\"Sleep the Clock Around\\" bubbles with lyrics streaming forth not calling too much attention to themselves as they quickly dart by, \\"In the morning you come to the ladies salon to get all fitted out for the Paperback Throne, but the people are living far away from the place where you wanted to help, it's a bit of a waste & the puzzle will last till somebody will say, 'There's a lot to be done while your head is still young.'\\"  The title track has an infectious melody with the handclap rhythm putting a smile on your face, only to have some extremely complex lyrics shoot by at laser speed, \\"A central location for you is a must as you stagger about making free with your lewd & lascivious boasts.\\"  I don't know how much B&S owe to the 60s, but one thing I do like from 60s music is that the songs were shorter!  \\"Simple Things\\" clocks in less than 2 minutes with a breezy upbeat melody.  \\"Dirty Dream #2\\" \\"Ease Your Feet in the Sea\\" with its samba-like rhythm are both excellent.  This is one of those albums that you grown into the more you listen to it.  Enjoy!
B0001HAISG|5.0|This new, live-action version of the classic is that  increasingly rare phenomenon: a movie that balances wondrous special effects with an intelligent, faithful rendering of charming story. Sumpter makes a superb Peter.
068987474X|3.0|A co-worker lent me the audio disc version of this book and I have to say it was not nearly as bad as some of the reviews on here would lead you to believe.  This book is a very basic primer on the excuses you will inevitably hear from men over the course of your single life. For each excuse the answer is the same: he's just not that into you, so move on!  It contains lots of common sense and is fairly humorous at times.  I would liken it to male version of THE RULES.  Many other reviewers have made snide remarks as to what type of women fall for these lame excuses instead just realizing that the guy isn't into them.  Look, there are a lot of excuses that women will put up with and many reasons why (low self esteem, hope springs eternal, desperation, etc...).  I cannot say that in the entire course of my dating life I too did not fall prey to some of these excuses. This book gives you the brutal honesty about why he hasn't called, showed you respect, showed up period, etc...It's harsh but effective.  We women have a tendency to live in la-la land when it comes to our relationships and this book sort of snaps you out of it.  I'd love to force some of my friends to listen to it just so they could finally \\"get it\\".  If you liked the Sex in the City  storylines, then you'll probably enjoy this book.  Some of what brought the star rating down was the condescending tone of voice the authors had on the audio version.  I really didn't need to hear their self affirming tones telling me I'm a \\"foxy lady\\". Blech!!! They really could've used a better editor.  Not everyone who reads this book suffers from low self esteem (deluded reality perhaps).  Overall worth purchasing.  Could possibly be used for single women's book group if you set some clear guidelines for the discussion.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|As directed by the brilliant John Ford, this movie is poetry. With Henry Fonda giving the performance of his career as Tom Joad, and actress Jane Darwell winning an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of Tom's beleaguered mother. It is a movie that speaks to the indomitable nature of the human spirit.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Just to correct everyone out there who is saying this DVD release is not the full movie, I just watched the official DVD and it is indeed 120 minutes long, unedited and uncut.  Not sure where the discrepency came from but you can be sure that you're not missing out on anything in the film on this DVD release. <br /> <br />As for the film itself...brilliant!
0792163710|5.0|Exciting, heart-warming and stunningly directed by veteran George Stevens, \\"Shane\\" also features a smart, lean script and inspired performances throughout. It ranks as one of our top westerns and top films. Dont miss that incredible ending
B000002LEU|5.0|Also a broad range. 'Warsaw' is quite different from 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'. Both are excellent. Includes what vies with 'Ceremony' for my favorite Joy Division song- 'Atmosphere'(apparently I'm quite unoriginal insofar as this is concerned). That song destroys. 'Dead Souls' is another favorite. <br />As has been said, an excellent introduction, though I began with 'Closer' and was an immediate convert. Either of them  or 'Unknown Pleasures', I think, would be about equal. Tough to say... <br />I wish 'Ceremony' were on this, but Ian Curtis was dead, so whatever. I like 'Still' too. <br />One of my favorite CDs, and one of my most frequently played. Excellent value.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Wilder seamlessly blends comedy, romance and pathos in this touching tale of a lonely man forced to confront the corruption of his life just as he falls helplessly in love. With winning performances by all-- and a priceless script by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond-- this film deservedly won Best Picture of 1960, and stands as my favorite Wilder film.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I bought this album in a roundabout fashion but am extremely pleased that I have. As an ardent U2 fan, I was intrigued when I found out a band called Arcade Fire was opening for them in Montreal. So I figured, let's give it a whirl and see if it's worth listening to.....The answer is....YES.....I think this is a band destined to have an exceptional career...I can say from now on, they have a new loyal fan...DEFINITELY on my top 10 for 2004...
B0000AUHPG|5.0|With due respect to director Leone's famous trilogy - which launched Clint Eastwood's career - this epic remains my favorite boasting a complexity and assurance, and benefitting from the presence of two brilliant actors playing against type: Fonda and Robards. Bronson turns in fine work, as does the exquisite Cardinale. Perfect fare a rainy day.
B000A6CLL0|3.0|I applaud \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\" for trying something bigger for its third season, but the results aren't terribly impressive.  The year-long storyline of the Enterprise searching out the mysterious Xindi and exploring the deadly \\"Expanse\\" region of the galaxy was good stuff, but there are a number of times where it simply doesn't go far enough, or where an episode nearly derails the entire thing.  It comes just to the edge of being quite good, but ultimately falls to the \\"OK\\" side of the fence.   <br /> <br />The show is still plagued by many of the same problems it suffered from before, most noticeably that much of the cast is simply ignored.  Instead of developing current cast members, new ones are introduced this season, only to be dropped or forgotten two episodes later.  The show continually takes two steps forward, and then quickly takes one back. <br /> <br />That said, there is some wonderful visceral entertainment in this season.  The writers and directors got a bit more bold, with larger, more impressive action sequences, and the special effects in this third season are second to none.  The final stretch of episodes (save the ludicrous and awful season finale) are quite thrilling.  If only the show had had the balls not to screw up the ending, this would easily be a Four-star season. <br /> <br />Even with the several large problems this season suffers from, the third season of \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\" (along with the fourth season) is the best season of \\"Star Trek\\" since the late 1990s.  That doesn't say much - it's still not nearly as good as it could or even should have been.  But it's worth checking out.
B00004RF98|5.0|An obvious choice, but hard to resist what is likely the best film musical of all time. The period music is delightful, and the dancing routines sensational. Thanks to a golden Comden & Green script, this is also among the funniest musicals ever made, especially with Hagens side-splitting performance as Lina. Must-viewing for the whole family.
B000002TQV|1.0|This is garbage.  <br /> <br />Real Music = Bruce springsteen, Nirvana, the beatles, led zeppelin, rolling stone, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Jimi hendrix, James brown, Little richard, Ray charles, The beach boys.  <br /> <br />Take your pick, any of them is better than Radiohead.
0767827791|5.0|A pungent slice of Americana with a bleak, desperate undercurrent.  Though Holden is slightly old for the role, he still turns in a credible performance. Kim Novak in her debut role is all budding sexuality disguised as wholesome innocence. Supporting players are varied and uniformly fine, including Robertson, Rosalind Russell, Arthur O'Connell and Susan Strasberg (Lee's daughter). The terrific score by George Duning only adds to the mood of repression and wistfulness.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This is garbage. <br /> <br />Real Music = Bruce springsteen, Nirvana, the beatles, led zeppelin, rolling stone, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Jimi hendrix, James brown, Little richard, Ray charles, The beach boys. <br /> <br />Take your pick, any of them is better than Radiohead.
0767812166|5.0|Made two years after Spielbergs \\"ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,\\" \\"Starman\\" invites comparison, but there's a  simplicity and charm to this film that never got its due. Bridges is astoundingly good as the visitor. One of the few romantic films youll see in this genre.
0805023461|5.0|My pre-K students love reading this big book.  They act out the animal sounds and try to predict what is coming next.  They ask to read it so often, they are almost reading it themselves.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Kurosawas ingenious breakthrough feature examines the elusive nature of truth, and our ability to reshape it to suit what we want to believe. Brilliantly composed and shot, the film's dreamlike quality is hypnotic. Thought-provoking and surprisingly accessible, Rashomon is a cinematic triumph.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Far less humorous than one would expect, with the only humorous gag being the (constantly repeated) Kim Il Jung depiction, which is truly funny, and not to mention well-deserved.  The main problem with the movie is that, unlike South Park, it is in fact full-time exasperatingly stupid and bullying. <br /> <br />Sad to say, but the creators of South Park have become what they profess to hate.  There is nothing that they enjoy more than graphically killing off celebrities who have the temerity to offer political opinions.  Yet now we have Stone and Parker, as celebrities, bloated with entitlement to set up straw men to mow down.  With their present celebrity status, their opinions are becoming more obnoxious than humorous, more bullying than incisive. <br /> <br />Caricaturing celebrities is one thing, but grossly misrepresenting anti-war opinions is another.  Parker and  Stone rather shamefully depict anti-war people (in this case a collection of anti-war celebrities) as not only against the war, but as actively fighting for North Korea against America!  This message is pretty much in line with the neo-cons straw man approach: character assassination for simpletons.  The net effect is to make the pro-war crowd feel good about themselves, fostering a belief that being against the war is traitorous. <br /> <br />Too bad.  I hope in the next movie they kill off the most bloated and opinionated celebrities in George W. Bush's America: themselves.
B00000JZI9|5.0|Both charismatic ensemble performances and swift pacing make this film rousing entertainment. It's fairly light fare as westerns go, but the players are having such fun, the audience just has to get in on it. Feast your eyes on this cast: Jeff Goldblum, Linda Hunt, Brian Dennehy, Rosanna Arquette, Scott Glenn and a young, energetic Kevin Costner. How can you lose?
B0007GAEGC|1.0|These songs are NOT performed by the original artists, know that first of all.  As such, they sound cheap rip offs (because they are).  If this is the kind of music you're after, you are MUCH better off to by it by the artist's themselves or off of other compilations.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Carrying the imprimatur of truth behind it-- and courtesy of Michael Mann's tense, semi-documentary shooting style-- the shocking events get brought into claustrophobic proximity, holding you breathless. A top-notch thriller by any standard.  Both Pacino and Crowe are outstanding.
B00003CXD5|4.0|Hi, I think this movie is excellent, Bogart and Huston were the best actors. This movie was filmed in Tampico, Mexico, my city, and was very exciting to watch how Tampico was before I had been born. Greetings from Tampico, Mexico
B0002DB50E|5.0|This movie is great and this criterion version is stunning! Buy it now! And go listen to Blondie.
B00011D1RC|5.0|definitely worth watching. all these people emerging from the decadence of 1910s and avant-garde of 20s thus bringing a charming mix of mannerism and crude realism. Joan Crawford's shoulders move should be taught in acting schools (do they already?). and damn, can Garbo take on camera! nowdays they cannot last more than 5 seconds of closeup without their faces desolving until they all start resembling one giant boring motionless face of Keanu Reeves doing \\"no spoon\\".
B0001AVZA8|5.0|It seems this is the quintessential adult romantic comedy.  With absolute greats like Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton as well as a great supporting cast \\"Somethings Gotta Give\\" is a beautiful film to watch and enjoy.  Sure the premise of the film - that a sixty-something bachelor could keep hooking up with young sexy twenty-somethings may seem a bit out of line but I am sure that there are plenty of twenty-somethings that find rich powerful and older men attractive.  But either way one must suspend their disbelief in order to properly enjoy comedy.  The film brings together a pair of middle aged adults that complement each other beautifully but don't realize it until the very end.  I don't want to further tell of the plot in the case that you fall into the 1% of people who haven't seen this one but do yourself a favor and check this one out. <br /> <br />Using beautiful locations like the Hamptons, New York City and Paris the films is spectacular and with an equally sumptuous soundtrack the film could be great even without the dialogue.  Then add in some great writing and its magic.  The only drawback is Keanu Reeves who's acting ability never seems to be convincing.  If they had cast Collin Farrell (or even Will Farrell) the film could have been better but overall this is a really enjoyable film that is suitable for nearly all audiences. While it may not be demographically engineered toward young audiences that doesnt detract and when our film industry provides so much content toward them and adult romantic comedy is totally welcome. It makes a great DVD to own because it is worth watching again and again and has a suitable amount of bonus material.  <br /> <br />- Ted Murena    <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|this is awesome. this is not comic in motion. somehow it's pure comic in static pictures put together to make super dynamic movie. black and white canvas, acid rain, fluorescent blood, narrative, everything is just where it should be making it incredibly stylish.  <br />special mention is Mickey Rourke as Marv who is great, just great. <br />
0312857063|4.0|If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you'll enjoy Stone of Tears as well.  There is less action in this story than its predecessor, but Goodkind begins to fill in the gaps with more social commentary.  Stone of Tears introduces loads of new characters as do the rest of the books in the Sword of Truth series.  Much more thought provoking than First Rule.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|One of the best pieces of celluloid magic I've seen come out of America, and I didn't even know it until the second time through. <br /> <br />On the first viewing I realised this psychological eauty was one of the most atmospheric films I'd seen in a long time, and it succeeded where hundreds of straight horror films had failed.  It had the same aesthetic and sense of creeping gloom that made me fall in love with Silent Hill 2. <br /> <br />However, things REALLY got interesting when the film was over.  This is so well orchestrated that everything you only noticed in passing the first time (while making mental notes to find an answer for it later) has a different relevance the second time through.  The bowl with candles floating in it?  The photo album?  The stuck clock?  The animatronic waitress in route 666?  The 'road to salvation' sign in route 666?  <br /> <br />The route 666 section, while interestingly symbolic, the first time through becomes an absolute revelation on the second.   <br /> <br />Not a single thing is incidental, every aspect, shot, every handwritten note, every character name, every clock face, prop and line is so layered with significance it's a joy behold.  Watch it twice or not at all.
B000002UJQ|1.0|I just love how some dude was pissed about the overall rating going from 5 to 4.5..I mean just Deal with it!! peace.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series has it all, for scifi and non-scifi fans alike.  Great dialogue, intriguing characters, engrossing storylines.  The more you watch it, the more you love it and the more you wish they hadn't cancelled the series.  I managed to addict three friends to it during vacation.  Imagine!  It's beautiful outside and we're all held up around the TV chain-watching the episodes.  Good times!  They've all asked to borrow my set - I don't expect to get it back anytime soon. One way or another, get your hands on this series and enjoy an excellent show. You won't regret it.  Very much looking forward to the movie September 30, 2005.
0790729342|4.0|Although The Road Warrior is technically the 1981 sequel to 1979's Mad Max, it does quite well as a stand-alone film. The narrator explains the events of the first film at The Road Warrior's beginning. The world has been degraded to desert-stricken chaos, and \\"Mad\\" Max (Mel Gibson) is the road warrior, a lone traveler across the desolate roads. He has lost his family, and as a result lost most reason to live. He is a \\"shell of a man\\", as the narrator explains. All he knows is survival. And, seeking to prolong that survival, he is in search of the holiest of possessions in the post-apocalypstic world: gasoline. The only ones able to survive in the new world are those with the skills of the road, as all other are destroyed and robbed of what little they have -- especially the much needed fuel. Max runs into trouble in the form of a murderous gang that are determined to become the rulers of the wastelands, lead by the barbaric Humungus. The gang's most recent plans are to over-run a small community of desert-dwellers for their fuel. Without originally intending to do so, the road warrior befriends the community and ultimately sees that they must all work together to defeat the gang and Humungus. With the help of a feral child, the goofy side-kick, and the group he now feels obligated to protect, Max takes on the enemy with road-raging speed, down-n-dirty combat brutality, and primitive determination, packing The Road Warrior with gritty action that's satisfying to any fan of the genre. As one of the most classic action characters, Mel Gibson has marked his place in cinematic history with The Road Warrior, and we can relive the adventure time and time again through DVD. So strap on your leather, grab the nearest sawed-off shotgun, hop in your dirt-caked hunk-a-junk car, and refuse to let the legend die!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I used to really hate Slipknot. Mainly beacause they wore masks and appeared to be a bit stange and maybe scary, but now I like them! This is because I heard the fantastic song 'Wait & Bleed' from the album 'Slipknot'. Then I stopped hating them and got this album. <br /> <br />1) Prelude 3.0 - Great introduction to the album, starting off with a slower song. Not that many lyrics, but its great! 4/5 <br /> <br />2) The Blister Exists - The first fast tempo song on the album. Perfect the mosh pit! 4/5 <br /> <br />3) Three Nil - Loud and worth an ear ache! 4/5 <br /> <br />4) Duality - The first track released from the album. You gotta love the guitar rifs, especially the part after the chours at the beginning! 5/5 <br /> <br />5) Opium of the People - Angry, loud and brilliant!!! Probably the best on the album! 5/5 <br /> <br />6) Circle - A song I wouldn't expect from Slipknot as it's acoustic. The lyrics are good. 5/5 <br /> <br />7) Welcome - Very fierce! 3/5 <br /> <br />8) Vermillion - The second release from the album. 4/5 <br /> <br />9) Pulse Of The Maggots - Strong and fast! 3/5 <br /> <br />10) Before I Forget - The third song released from Subliminal Verses. The riffs are fantastic! 4/5 <br /> <br />11) Vermillion pt.2 - Second part to Vermillion. Good acoustic end to it (But is this end?) 4/5 <br /> <br />12) The Nameless - A mix of electric guitar & acoustic. Great combination! 3/5 <br /> <br />13) The Virus Of Life - I love the introduction 'I can see you but you can't see me' 3/5 <br /> <br />14) Danger, Keep Away - A slower song but fantastic! Music sounds like a funeral. Good end to the album. 4/5
B00006JDVV|4.0|Exchanging the medieval castles and knights for the post-apocalypstic world of England's burnt ruins (as a result of the resurrection of the existence of dragons), Reign Of Fire presents a different kind of dragon-tale. The dragons here are of a gigantic reptilian species that can fly and breathe fire. Sounds familiar, right? Well, not exactly. Far from the magical mythos of the classic fantasy dragon, these are enormous animals presented just as believable as the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea. Even their ability to breathe fire has scientific backing (in a snake-like manner, they project two separate liquids from their mouths at an inward angle and, as the liquids combine in the air, flames are born). CGI and physical props are both used to bring the dragons to life on the screen, and it's a job well done! The dragons are strikingly realistic. They are very grim and vicious creatures, who feed on ash (how convenient, since they so evilly enjoy consuming everything they see with fire). They are nothing more than barbaric beasts willing to do anything for survival. The result is the prefect darker atmosphere for this type of monster film.<br /><br />As for the plot, there isn't too much to keep you distracted from the mesmerizing creatures, but enough to support a decent storyline. Christian Bale plays the leader of a small community gathered since the downfall of civilization. Mathew McConaughey is the buff and arrogant American military man that has arrived to take matters into his own hands with the assistance of his small army. Of course, the two end up collaborating as dragonslayers. They discover that to stop the plague of flying monsters, they must defeat the one living male who breeds with the females. If they can stop him, the dragons' existence will fade. But, as we all should expect, the deadly task isn't going to be an easy one!<br /><br />In conclusion, Reign Of Fire should be seen by every dragon lover. There is plenty of screen-time for the dragons, and the special effects are the best you could ask for. Not to mention, the DVD includes some pretty neat special features, including a documentary on the construcion of the dragons and their adaptation to the film. While the classic formula for a dragon film will always remain entertaining, sometimes we need a different look at these terrifying creatures, and Reign Of Fire succeeds in every way. It's a breath of fresh air (or perhaps smoke-infested air, heheh) from the average modern monster movie, and deserves a look from anyone interested in the genre.e special effects are the best you could ask for.

0385338686|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and couldn't put it down. I was so thrilled to have it just in time for my vacation -- it was a great beach read. I only wish Sophie could write 'em as fast as I get through 'em.
B0007GAERG|1.0|One of the most annoying singers on earth is back after an extended (and welcomed) vacation and she's on top again, thanks to one great song on this cd, \\"We Belong Together,\\" which takes her back to her roots and is the type of ballad that she does well. This probably annoys her to no end considering that she is still the diva wanna-be, trying so hard to be \\"hip hop\\" and becoming an embarrassment in the process. The album cover photo, obviously borrowed from Beyonce, should be a warning! She's even darkened her skin tone! (shades of Michael Jackson???) \\"We Belong Together\\" is the only decent song on the cd - a jazzy \\"Stay The Night\\" is a good try -but most of the music here is tired and mediocre (especially \\"Shake It Off,\\" the second release, which has to be one of the most irritating songs ever recorded!)
B00006JDU9|4.0|Lets just say this is when/where it all begins.  In order to appreciate the Trilogy it is necessary to understand the life of Darth Vadar (Anikan Skywalker). <br /> <br />This episode if full of details about Anikan Skywalkers life as a young boy and his acceptance to be trained as a Jedi.  Once again great special effects.  This is a must watch movie if you want to be a true Star Wars fan.  May the force be with you.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|(Please be warned that this is a very long review.  I evaluate each song, but after that are the flaws and a quick list of what's nice if you just want to hear about that)<br /><br />I've been a fan of Nightwish for only one year, yet I've managed to pick up all of their \\"main\\" albums but Angels Fall First.  I've listened to Oceanborn, Wishmaster, Century Child, Over the Hills and Far Away, and now Once.  I was a bit nervous to try out Once, because when I first heard it, it was on a site with close to no quality in their audio (oops on my part).  However, after hearing Nemo and Wish I Had an Angel over and over again, I gave it a try.<br /><br />Two days later, I feel I have listened to the songs over and over again to evaluate it enough.  While on my first listen I was blown away, I have cooled down and can meet the flaws of the album.  Mind you, it IS beautiful, and will probably shortly replace Century Child in my CD Player, but it is not perfect.<br /><br />I think I will review each song separately, then summarize my feelings at the end.<br /><br />Dark Chest of Wonders - 5/5 - Just... Wow.  I was blown away when I first heard it.  It's hard and heavy.  It's just gorgeous.  The orchestra sounds lovely.  This is also one of the few songs on the album that makes good use of the choir; they are not used for most of the song, but a rather interesting beginning to each verse.  Tarja actually sings the chorus, which is nice.  Everything just blends beautifully in this beginning song.  It's one of my favorites.<br /><br />Wish I Had an Angel - 3/5 - While this was the song that made me buy the album, it is not the best.  In fact, it is very mediocre compared to the others.  I like the guitars and general melody, but Tarja doesn't sound as great as she normally does, and Marco's voice does not sound nice.  It is catchy, and it is nice and heavy, but it's not Nightwish's best.  And watch out for the video.  You get a bunch of head banging and Tarja doing \\"Victoria Secret\\" poses as Ceido pointed out earlier.  It's good enough to make me listen to it once in a while, but not so great that I can listen to it over and over anymore.<br /><br />Nemo - 4/5 - A pretty song with a nice mix of the band and a pretty piano.  Tarja sounds nice in the chorus, as always.  It's not as heavy as the first two songs, which is a nice break (though I like things nice and heavy).  However, it is not my favorite; unfortunately, I can't quite say what it is.  It is in general a very pretty song, but not the best in the album, and just something about it doesn't seem quite right.  Perhaps I just listened to it too many times.<br /><br />Planet Hell - 4.5/5 - The male choir is a really cool beginning, but somehow the full choir coming in loses its feeling.  However, the song makes up for it.  Marko actually sounds RIGHT in this song!  He really helps the song instead of worsening it, and actually sounds nice against Tarja's vocals (which sound best in the chorus.  Uh, again).  The choir really wasn't necessary during the chorus, but it doesn't detract too much.<br /><br />Creek Mary's Blood - 5/5 - I really like this song.  While some may not like the intermingling of Native American themes with metal, I really think it gives it a very nice touch.  The chanting is very pretty, as is the flute (I think it's a flute?).  Of course, Tarja sounds great, and surprisingly she sounds great in both the chorus and normal verses!  This is one of those rare songs that I liked most when it was quiet and not too heavy, though the heavy chorus was still pretty.  Generally a very sad song, but beautiful nonetheless.<br /><br />The Siren - 3/5 - I don't like this song all that much.  The beginning is cool, but once everyone starts singing... Eh.  It goes downhill.  Tarja doesn't sound as nice as she normally does, and really, the best singing comes from the \\"Oh, Oh, Oh, Oooooh\\" after Tarja sings a bit, and near the middle.  Marko doesn't sound wonderful once again.  Honestly, the song has a gorgeous melody and may have been best as an instrumental; the singing is poor.<br /><br />Dead Gardens - 2/5 - The Siren at least had a good melody.  Dead Gardens doesn't even manage that one.  It is very repetitive, in melody and singing.  Tarja shouldn't have repeated/dragged out (I can't tell which one she's doing; maybe both) the words of some songs; it makes her sound very silly.  The whispering near the middle isn't bad, but unnecessary, and the chorus is probably the best part (even that isn't too great).<br /><br />Romanticide - 3/5 - \\"Aie!  Dead Gardens repeated?!\\" was my first thought.  The beginning sounds nearly identical to Dead Gardens, and the \\"Oh!\\"'ing is silly in this song.  Tarja sounds better than she did before, but I am not overly fond of the melody... Until the chorus comes (yeah, yet again).  After the first chorus comes (around 2min 32s), though, things improve considerably.  The melody picks up, Tarja sounds better, and the drumming becomes really nice.  The whispering and screaming near the end really ruin it, however; it sounds like Nightwish decided to try being truly metal, and it didn't work.<br /><br />Ghost Love Score - 5/5 - I love it.  I can't describe it.  People may say it's overrated, but damn it's GORGEOUS.  The choir is actually used properly again.  The orchestra is beautiful.  Tarja sounds wonderful.  Marko is out of the picture (poor guy; I may sound unkind, but I just don't like his voice).  The band sounds great.  Nightwish chose to grab everything (but Marko's voice) and pack it together, and it worked!  Definitely one of Nightwish's best, and the chorus actually sounds beautiful having the choir sing it.  I could (and do!) listen to this song many times in a row without pause.  While most may not like the repeating of the chorus at the end, I really like it.  The song may be long, but I personally love the long songs.  Just beautiful...<br /><br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan - 4/5 - At first, I didn't like this song, probably because Ghost Love Score was before it.  I've listened to the native Finnish language in songs before, and thus hearing Tarja sing it wasn't strange for me.  It was just so slow, and I'm not one for the slower songs.  However, after a few more listens, the sad melody and Tarja complement each other well.  It is rather pretty, as long as you don't mind how soft it is (I like the heavy songs.  Can't help it; it can drown out my silly family well!).  It's one of the Nightwish songs that need more than one listen to be really appreciated.<br /><br />Higher than Hope - 4/5 - The beginning lacks a bit -- the strings just doesn't sound too great until 1min.  Then the chorus comes in; while it isn't the best part (gasp!), it does help bring the song up a notch and get rid of the poor beginning.  The strings blend together with the rest nicely, and while the song sounds VERY familiar to previous ones, it at least is not as bad as they are!  At 3min 12s, what sounds like a radio newscast or something comes in; it sounds like it was added to the song, and while I can't quite tell what he's saying, it probably deals with the song's lyrics (or maybe it's the other way around).  Another song that will most likely need more than one listen.<br /><br />White Night Fantasy (Bonus Track) - 2/5 - I don't like this song.  The beginning is rather pretty, but once Tarja comes in, it, surprisingly, goes downhill.  I agree with many others; Tarja sounds silly here.  Her voice is practically squeaky, and she sounds untrained.  She sounds lovely during the chorus, but the melody seems generally cliched and it just isn't a good song.<br /><br />Live to Tell the Tale - 4/5 - It starts off reminding me of Christmas music; thankfully, it goes away from that and becomes Nightwish.  You can still hear the Christmas music in the background, but it's drowned out.  It is a very pretty song, with Tarja sounding lovely in more than just the chorus.  It's basically the same story as Higher than Hope - Sounds very similar to other songs, but does a better job.<br /><br />----<br /><br />In general, seven of the eleven original songs are a good listen, which seems to be what I generally get from a good Nightwish track.  Of the two bonus tracks, one is a good listen; again, Nightwish quality.  Here are its flaws:<br /><br />Chorus the best part: Notice how almost every time, the chorus was the best part?  This isn't normal.  Previous Nightwish albums had beautiful choruses, yes, but they weren't always the best part.  Over the Hills and Far Away had a great chorus, but the normal verses were great too; Astral Romance didn't even NEED a chorus to be great.  Here, you practically wait for the chorus for the song to get really good.  If Nightwish makes another album, they should try to make the entire song memorable, not just the chorus.<br /><br />Choir Overused: The choir was only truly awesome in two songs: Dark Chest of Wonders and Ghost Love Score.  They appeared in plenty more, but it was overused and didn't sound right.  Furthermore, they sounded best when actually SAYING something.  After a few songs, I got tired of just hearing the choir sing \\"Oh\\".  If that's all the room you have for them, leave them out; the song will be better.<br /><br />Variety: Variety lacked.  Dead Gardens, Romanticide, Higher than Hope, and Live to Tell the Tale sounded far too similar.  If it weren't for their own unique additions, Dark Chest of Wonders, The Siren, and Planet Hell would probably sound similar to them as well.  That's seven out of thirteen songs.  Previous Nightwish albums have had good variety, with each song being unique; even Wishmaster, one of my least favorites, had some variety.  Once lacks that variety; the songs are beautiful, but variety would make them unique and make them so easier to remember.<br /><br />---<br /><br />There are other minor things, but I won't mention them.  Now, what's good about this album?  Well, the orchestra is beautiful in nearly every song, Tarja sounds great, Marco doesn't sound silly all the time, the songs that are epic ARE exceptional, and the band sounds good when they actually try a bit of variety.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's Nightwish material.  It has its flaws, but it is beautiful regardless.  While I would not recommend you start off with it if you're new to Nightwish, if you're a Nightwish fan like me, I think you can appreciate it.<br /><br />Have fun, and happy listening!4/5 - At first, I didn't like this song, probably because Ghost Love Score was before it.

B000000W5F|5.0|This may be the Stones best one along with Sticky Fingers in my view.I hadn't heard in about 15 years, but it sounds even better now than when I was a college freshman drinkng prodigous amounts of beer to it, when it was released in Sep. 81 &, we thought the Stones were ancient then! It's all killer no filler as they say- Black Limousine- a terrific blues number,& Tops a good neo soul story song are probably the two weakest things on here. Even Beggars, Bleed, and Exile as great as they are had a couple mediocre things on them. Slave is perfection-no one can touch it in the soul/funk realm -Hang Fire & Little T&A are fantstic high energy rockers effortlessly layed out & Neighbors is a song most of us can relate too & the conviction is thru the roof.Worried About You & Waiting On  A Friend are two of their very best most moving ballads and that's saying a mouthful.In anticipation of the new one, I'm trying to go thru all their stuff & am totally astonished how good it all is Steel Wheels,Black And Blue, Satanic, Metamorphosis etc.Haven't heard the last two Babylon & Voodoo Lounge, so even if they suck it hardly matters.
0393317552|4.0|I found this book fascinating and was unable to stop reading it.  The writing style of Diamond made it easy for me to move through the book quickly while still having time to contemplate the various topics brought up.  Diamond attempts to convince his readers that all races are equal and the only reason one race developed quicker than another was due to geographical conditions, not inherent intelligence.  After reading this book, and recalling some of Darwin's principles of evolution, I decided that people living in favorable geographic locations would become higher forms of human evolution than those unfortunate humans who had unfavorable conditions.  Sorry Jared.

B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast burst into the scene with Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik which was heavy on funk beats and rhymes. Though it is not considered to be the best album that Outkast made it is what put them on the map. Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was <br />overlooked by average hip hop fans but listening to it shows what Outkast had in store for years to come. Outkast's sophomore album, ATLiens, released two years after Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik had more acclaim then their freshmen album and started them on their way. <br /> <br />ATliens left behind the funk era they created in their freshmen album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, and went with a fresh new sound. ATliens has a crisp sound with the sci-fi like beats with instrumentals from live instruments such as pianos, guitars, and others. By creating persona's in ATLiens they show their artistic abilities and begin to let loose their rhyming prowess by releasing their skill on songs ranging in sound from 70's funk to gospel and everything in between. With the smooth melodic beats by Organized Noize and rhymes from Outkast, ATLiens switches from track to track smoothly and is easily listened to from the first track to the very last track. <br /> <br />The first track \\"You May Die (Intro)\\" opens with a piano and classical guitar picking which sets the tempo for the whole album. The second track into the album, \\"Two Dope Boyz (In a Cadillac)\\", the listener is greeted by a robotic sounding \\"Greetings Earthling\\" followed by a bass heavy beat. \\"Two Dope Boyz (In a Cadillac)\\" is one most noticed singles off the ATLiens album. This is accredited greatly to Dre and Big Boi's flow. \\"Jazzy Belle\\" one of the better songs on ATLiens shows a perfect mix of Dre and Big Boi's rhyming skills, a great beat, good vocals, and good scratching. <br /> <br />\\"Elevators (Me & You)\\" is the top single off the ATLiens album. The beat hits heavy as the tempo gets set by Dre as he starts in on one of the greatest hip hop songs as himself andBig Boi follow through. The song and the hook of \\"Elevators (Me & You)\\" is one of the catchier on the entire album and should be heard by every music fan. \\"Babylon\\" follows, which is a personal favorite, with Dre spitting out a unique rhyme which blends with the intro of the song. The beats and vocals in \\"Babylon\\" are smooth and are easily taken in as Dre and Big Boi play off this with their precise lyrical additions. There is a life released throughout the album from the intro \\"You May Die (Intro)\\" to the second to last track \\"13th Floor/Growing Old\\". <br /> <br />ATLiens has been said to have been the stepping stone for Outkast. ATLiens sent Outkast on their way to stardom but if Outkast had not continued to change their musical style would they still be where they are now? That is unknown but as Outkast progressed through out their careers their musical style did as well. Having great lyrical prowess and a unique style of combining different styles and eras of music into one is what makes Outkast who they are. ATLiens is a must own for any fan of hip hop music and is a must listen to for those who are a fan of music. Before there was Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Stankonia, and even the older Aquemini there was ATLiens.
0316172324|5.0|I read this book several months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it -- both at the time and on numerous occasions since, when for one reason or another, parts of it came back to mind.  <br /> <br />The poor reviews baffle me; I can only guess that a number of readers expected it to be a how-to or self-improvement book, with clearly articulated steps about how to get from Point A to Point B. What it is, instead, is the exposition of a theory, complete with a wide variety of supporting evidence.  <br /> <br />I suppose some of the evidence could seem tangential if you were looking for a quick read that solved all your problems (or at least made you *think* all your problems would be solved), but for someone who is able to see the world in shades of gray, rather than in black and white, Gladwell offers an expansive look at how influential \\"gut feelings\\" can be -- and why.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Please skip this trash and buy some good music. This album is just BORING!! I mean it's so boring that I almost fell asleep while listning! I am not kidding. I tried Hard to like this album But I couldnt..Truly a dissapointing album.
074325144X|3.0|This book has a lot of good information it - probably too much.  Unless you are really going to focus on something, it's very hard to remember more than two or three core ideas.  I am a casual runner - maybe two or three runs per week of three to five miles - and I really hoped this book would give me a couple areas of focus that would make my running safer, more comfortable and perhaps faster.  Instead, I got overload.  There is a single 2-page spread in this book that lists about 50 points to focus on in your running.  Come again?  That doesn't sound very Zen to me (I know it's a different Eastern philosophy, but you get the idea). <br /> <br />Dreyer ackowledges the length of the list and suggests picking out two or three of these ideas to focus on for each run, but you still need to be pretty serious to do that.  I don't want to consult a checklist before each run and I want to plug into my iPod and relax a little while I'm running. <br /> <br />In addition, Dreyer gives a pre- and post-run routine that would add about an hour to any run you wanted to do - again, more than I'm able to commit to this portion of my life. <br /> <br />If you are a very serious runner or want to become one, this is a great book (assuming you can handle a few funky mystical references).  On the other hand, if you are looking for two or three areas of focus to make you a better casual runner, they're tough to pull from this book. <br /> <br />Recommended for serious runners who are looking to avoid or recover from injuries.

And it is great to find all the books in this one, nice, hardcover collection. I read it to my nephew and neice, and they loved it, as I'm sure your kids will too (and more than a few of you adults).
B000AARKOO|3.0|It is hard not to draw comparison's between this film and Gladiator, which Scott also directed. Both films open in a snowy climate with male protagonists being cast into exodus and going on journeys of redemption. Both this film and Gladiator have the same cynical message, overrated actors, and stark lighting.  But while Gladiator was at least able to keep the story tight, Kingdom of Heaven loses the message fairly quickly and becomes a film more focused on medieval politics than the people involved. <br /> <br />The initial storyline, which is the strongest, regards the relationship between an estranged knight (Neeson) and his illegitimate son (Bloom). Both men seek redemption, Bloom for his dead wife and Neeson for not having given his son a father. Suffice it to say that the outcome of this subplot, if extended to full length, would have made a much better film. Once Neeson's character is gone and Bloom has to lead the movie by himself, the film changes rails. <br /> <br />The film is beautiful in the early scenes that take place in the snowy country side of France. But once in Jerusalem, the colors become drab and desaturated. The sets become boring and rectangular as though everything was built with graham crackers. Scott must have never seen Lawrence of Arabia, because he has no clue how interesting the desert can be if shot appropriately. His desert settings are so lifeless and drab, they may as well have been filmed at an LA parking lot.  All indoor scenes appear to have been lit with a torch, especially later in the movie when Scott really starts unleashing the depressing imagery. <br /> <br />There is little need to mention the other characters in the film. Edward Norton is a talking mask that manages to have better range and draw more audience sympathy than Orlando Bloom. Martin Csoskas is an antagonizing Templar knight, so ridiculously evil that he makes his role unintentionally funny. Eva Green plays a pencil necked princess, who cakes on eye shadow sothick that she looks like a corpse. She apparently supposed to be a love interest, but spends most of the film acting like she wants to die. <br /> <br />The big siege at the end of the film, meant to be a climax, is merely depressing. The context given for it is that it all seems to be a misunderstanding caused by a few evil Christians. Rather than building in intensity, like the siege in the Two Towers or Return of the King (or pretty much any film about the French Foreign Legion) the battle climaxes early with an orgy of flaming catapults and then slowly runs out of steam. The last melee engagement over a hole in the wall is a blurry confusing mess that eventually fades to black. <br /> <br />I don't really feel a need to comment on the politics of the film, since they're fairly overt to all but the most impressionable. Ridley Scott's film is clearly a work of fiction: refusing to admit the slightest flaw in any of the Muslim characters who \\"just want to get along\\". Still the overt political correctness is fairly easy to overlook and ultimately harms the film very little. What ultimately turned me against this film, was that it had no clue what the people in it were fighting and dying for. \\"For a chance to survive\\" is not the answer I was looking for. What kind of a defeatist motto is that? <br />
B00005JKG9|2.0|After reading reviews and seeing the impressive casting I had a certain amount of expectation... sadly few were fulfilled. Interesting characters and a simple plot, well acted... should be in the bag, just don't know where it went wrong... No wonder I had never heard of it. If you want to watch a better depiction of a pressurised, sales environment try Boiler Room, Swimming with Sharks or Wall Street.

B00005JL2O|5.0|After \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" grossed $ 204 million at the box office, it seemed inevitable that a third Austin Powers would soon hit theaters. In 2002, \\"Austin Powers In Goldmember\\" was released. Though it did not gross as much as expected, this third outing is just as funny as the first two films and some ways funnier.<br /><br />Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) have escaped from prison and have enlisted the help of Dutch criminal mastermind Goldmember (also Myers). They locate Austin's father Nigel (Michael Caine, perfectly casted), kidnap him and take him back to 1975. Austin is reluctant to rescue, as his father has never been their for him for all the important events in his life. But his heart leads him in the right direction, as he rescues his father and also finds yet another love interest: Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles). Dr. Evil and Golmemeber have hatched yet another dastardly plan for world domination. Austin, Fozy and Nigel must save the day, and yes, the results are hilarious. And if the ending is somewhat trite, well, that's the way it was written.<br /><br />This film is great. However, it should be note that is not for fans with a sensitive stomach. The first \\"Austin Powers\\" hinted at gross out humor, and \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" crossed the line slightly, but neither took it to the extremes this film goes to. Fat B*stard is even more disgusting this time around. Also, this film seems chronic to came overload: Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny DeVito, Kevin Spacey, Quincy Jones, Britney Spears, Rob Lowe, Fred Savage (mole!), Katie Couric, The Osbornes and John Travolta all appear at one point or another. However, they're all enjoyable, so you can look past that.<br /><br />This film is a worthy inclusion in the \\"Austin Powers\\" series. Highly recommended. Can't wait for the next one!
0385513755|3.0|I'm really not sure what this book is suppose to be.  Was it an historical fiction? or what Dan Brown made it....a mystery riding on the back of convoluted grail legends.<br /><br />There are several problems with this book that keep me from giving it a very high rating.  They are as follows:<br /><br />1.  The writing is very sophomoric.  It is an easy read even at the 454 pages.  Alot of the clues I figured out long before the great Symbologist, Robert Langdon, and the whiz girl Cryptolgist, Sophie Neveu.  Waiting for them to catch up through several pages of reading was just annoying.  The novel starts off great at first, mires down through the middle and the ending seemed to be to quickly contrived.  It is almost like Brown didn't know where to go or how to end the book..especially with all the open ended questions he creates.<br /><br />2.  I know this is suppose to be some kind of work of fiction but it includes alot of verifiable historical data.  Some ancient and some modern.  The historical aspects of the novel are just too bizarre to be taken for real.  Brown fills the lacuna with to many jumps of fantasy and logic.  First off, the history of the Priory of Sion is just to recent to include the likes of Leonardo and Newton..let alone others. Including the Masons and the Templars, the history is just a hodgepodge of anything that had to do with the Grail.  I'm suprised he didn't include Rennes-le-Chateau as he used the name Sauniere, the Abbot, for the name of museums curator.  His history of Leonardo is just to speculative to be believed.  For most of this there is no evidence to support the theories.  Including the notion that Leonardo was gay is at best speculative and had nothing to do with the novel. Most grail legends come from France and the Biliotheque Nationale de France, the national library of France, is a good source for these. Including the Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland was an obvious choice...If grail seekers had their way Rosslyn would be just a pile of rubble.<br /><br />3. As a believer in the Bible as the word of God, the novel requires me to put the New Testament in a questionably false position.  The novel is anti-christ anti-savior in nature and puts the life and mission of Jesus in the what-if realm.<br /><br />If I were a Merovingian what better way to get on the throne of France than to start the rumor that I had the blood of Christ in me, get some documents to show it and the have the poor peasants believe it.  A nice way to get some power.  These secret societies have always been around and the secrets they hold and what value they possess have always been a rich source for legends. There are always people out there trying to tear down any religion but they don't offer anything to replace it or what they do offer is hollow and meaningless.<br /><br />Writing controversy, especially ones that attack Christian beliefs, is a good sales technique designed to do one thing and one thing only...make lots of money.  Which appears just what his novel has done. Hopefully anyone who reads this book will dive below the straw Dan Brown scatters upon the surface to find the real pearls below.<br /><br />I rate this:  (Pictures..5 Story..3 History..1) = 3 Starsjust a pile of rubble. <br /> <br />3.

0471267554|5.0|What I like most in this book is the emphasis on adaptation. In all living organisms adaptation is achieved via a few simple processes: mutation, fusion/ recombination, and selection of the genes that occur during the reproduction process only while the organism prepares its genes to transmit them to the next generation. The resistance of bacteria to antibiotics demonstrates that an adaptation necessitates about one thousand generations. Bacteria divide rapidly and can have thousand generations in one year. In human one thousand generations takes about 15 to 20,000 years. This is why we are poorly adapted to the changes in the diet resulting from agriculture that started 10 to 12,000 years ago. This is why we are absolutely not adapted to more recent changes, like starch and sugar excess, deficiency of other carbohydrates than those found in starch and sugar,the refining of food, additives and pesticide residus, mineral and vitamin scarcity and the essential fatty acid imbalance of the American diet. This is why our genes still prefer the ancestral Paleo diet!

0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is the first book in a series of books about the improvement of one's Personal finance.  The book repeatedly talks about getting out of the 'rat race' that the poor and middle class seem to be in.  It is a good book in the sense that it motivates you to get more involved in your personal finance, but if you are looking for a book to give you how to get rich, than this is not for you. <br /> <br />Great read if youre looking for something to do.
B000069HZP|1.0|ONE star for lack of a SE. If you were lucky to collect films on laserdisc in the 90's you had the chance to own this Fincher classic; unfortunately, you cannot partake of its supplemental material on dvd. It is a JOKE that whichever studio owns the rights will not give this the deluxe treatment. It isn't as though Fincher is some hack - look at what he's accomplished. It's a title that warrants a SE, there is NO QUESTION. Criterion, DO IT!

Not only does this book give us a picture of what the '30s in the South must have felt, but it gave us a heartwarming story of american culture. <br /> <br />There is no question why school's all across the nation have this book as a required reading
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since around 2000 and I've increasingly grown to like the band.  Rush of Blood to the Head was a very good CD and X&Y I think is better in a lot of ways.  It's a tough call, but I'm also a huge fan of all their CDs.   <br /> <br />Anyway, good work on X&Y, according to a big Coldplay fan.
6303471714|4.0|If you are looking for a semi-fasted pace workout this is it.  It is not technically named a \\"aerobic\\" exercise video, but by the time you start doing the lunges and listening to Cindy's out of breath narration you will be sweating the pounds off.  The best benefit from this video is the toning and \\"butt lifting\\" experience.  Good luck and take it easy the first few times-you woudn't want to hurt yourself!

0452285186|2.0|this book is a lot better than \\"Unpleasant Ways to die,\\" but most of that is attributed to the fact that we all want to smash bunnies with our fists. fun little sequences, while others are lame and predicatable, not the kind of book you'd buy if you're trying to hit bottom. <br /> <br />
B00006RCNW|5.0|This edgy series takes us into the fictional, violent LA community of Farmington and introduces us to the morally conflicted cops who police it.  Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) is the volatile leader of a special squad (Walton Goggins and Kenny Johnson) whose members are not above supplementing their incomes by ripping off the dealers they bust and using threats, intimidation, and violence to get results.  The character of Vic Mackey, as conceived by Chiklis and the show's creators, is an astonishing balancing act; although he commits morally indefensible acts during the course of the season, he never completely loses our sympathy, perhaps because of his genuinely passionate desire to stop dangerous criminals.  When he points a gun at another major character in the series finale, I honestly didn't know whether he would pull the trigger or not.  It's rare that the main character of a TV series has that kind of unpredictability. <br /> <br />Lest it seem that the whole thing is about Mackey, let me point out that this is really an ensemble show.  There's an ambitious captain with political aspirations (Benito Martinez), a conflicted rookie struggling with his homosexuality (Michael Jace), a brilliant young detective who craves respect (Jay Karnes), and much more.  Can't wait to see the following seasons.
B0000025L0|5.0|I keep telling friends that of all the jazz funk albums released back in the 1970's, \\"School Days\\" was probably the best of them all. It is probably because Stanley Clarke, the master bassist, didn't resist the time he was living and playing in; he embraced it. He put the funk right in the middle of this album, recruited a brilliant group of musicians who all played with energy and passion, and just let it all come together like any jazz album, be it fusion, traditional, bebop, New Orleans style, free jazz or whatever. This isn't simply funk and jazz riffs being fused; these are well crafted and composed compositions full of emotion, power, and tradition. \\"School Days,\\" the title track, gets the album started by announcing to the world and any doubters, that funk is here to stay and jazz and funk can easily co-exist. Clarke provides the statement with the legendary funk opening, and the album is off and running. There are no wasted moments either. \\"Quiet Afternoon\\" is brilliant. \\"Hot Fun\\" is a jazz jam. \\"Life is Just a Game\\" is bold and majestic. Each song is a unique piece of creativity that adds to Clarke's statement. Perhaps, he is giving the world a lesson here or maybe he is just remembering when he was in school; regardless, \\"School Days\\" was a funk era masterpiece of electric jazz. None of Miles' electric stuff was ever this good, but then again, as I wrote at the beginning, this is the best jazz funk album ever recorded.
B000244FDW|5.0|Not much to add to other reviewers.  I first carefully selected the Colin Firth version, knowing I had this one on tape.  But I'm glad now to have both on DVD.  You can reread Jane Austen because there are so many facets.  You can watch multiple versions for the same reasons.
B00005JNTX|5.0|What an excellent film! I was not able to catch it in the theatres - my loss. The three stories were intertwined wonderfully & my attention did not stray once. The violence is quite intense; but that is expected from Frank Miller's material. The casting was near perfect, especially a \\"creepy\\" Elijah Wood. Visually, I cannot stay enough...this is how Dick Tracy Should have been made. And a comparison to Pulp Fiction should not be done...Sin City is its own entity & will easily become a \\"classic\\" for new generations to enjoy in years to come.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens is a brilliant lyricist, musician, composer and researcher. His work is rich and full. Well worth many listens.

B000AM4PBS|1.0|Please don't get me wrong.  I'm a HUGE, MAJOR Friends fanatic, but there are millions more like me who've already forked out over $200 (give or take) for the first 9 sets.  If people already have those, who's actually gonna pay for this? <br /> <br />I surely am not.  Thankfully, The Complete Tenth Season will come out separately on the same day that this comes out.  That's what I'll be buying. <br /> <br />As for this set?  Well...people who are just becoming fans of this show should go ahead and just buy the big box set.  I see no reason for Warner doing this...other than to make money off of one television history's most popular shows.
B000065PUE|5.0|Every so often, a truly superior effort slips through the cracks of even the most ardent music fan. A buddy lent me a copy of \\"Doolittle\\" by the Pixies and now I feel like I've \\"discovered\\" something remarkable. But a word of warning, reserve judgement until you have listened to it three times! I say this because the style varies greatly from song to song and the vocals of Black Frances are unusual. But the songs are killer, ranging from shout-it-out cuts such as \\"Debaser\\" to straight pop songs like \\"Here Comes Your Man\\". Throw in complete changes of pace like \\"Dead\\", which brought to mind some of the more inventive David Bowie or Iggy Pop efforts of the early 80's. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, the next song will take you in an entirely different direction. The bouncing beat of \\"Mr. Grieves\\" acelerates to the manic pace of \\"Crackity Jones\\", slows down again for \\"La La Love You\\" and \\"There Goes My Gun\\" before completely changing gears yet again...well, you get the idea. It's quite a ride! <br />It's a shame I was sleeping for the last fifteen plus years and missed the \\"Pixies\\", but now I'm going to make up the time by wearing their CDs out.
B00006JDU9|5.0|The DVD came in great shape and in a timely manner.  Great job!!
0743454537|5.0|By far one of Piccoult's best...if not THE best.  This is a great story with rich characters.  The protagonist is strong and smart and the people in the book are truly human.  I was sad when it was over.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|I can take the fact that it's not faithful to the comic, no comic book movie really is (With the exception of Sin City) but when the movie is done this badly, you have to stand up and call it like it is. Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character was fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several story lines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written. Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time. I think the director was trying to give a kind of noir feel to the film but back out on what noir really means because he rather copy on what was done before than to come up with something truly original. <br /> <br />If you like to watch bad movies, then have yourself a good time, because the movie is that bad but if you looking for a good film that respects the comic book, this is not it.  <br /> <br />
B0007Y4USW|1.0|ok as an old Mariah Carey fan I am telling you to NOT buy this record. And no Im not even saying this b/c Mariah has in effect totally changed her musical style. While she used to make catchy and good pop music, she now creates bad r n b w/ cliche and embarassing rapper guest stars, who never save her music but only make it sink even lower. If Mariah at least made well made r n b music then that would be fine, but the music that this album presents is an  embrassing and laughable deprarture from the Mariah good ole days. The fact that this album is selling like hot cakes is irrelevant b/c the old Mariah is gone forever, and the songs all are really bad. We Belong together could be tollerable, but have you noticed Mariah cant hit the same notes she used to? She sings very differently now b/c she cannot sing the way she used to. Its like that is an empty attempt at a first single b/c even a newcomer can produce a better song than this. As for her latest Shake it off, come on!!!!!! <br />I do love Mariah, so dont get me wrong, she used to be fantastic, its just sad who she has become.
078681859X|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.... <br /> <br />Why you ask... it's refreshing in so many ways. I liked how the story switched between Nathaniel and Bartimaeus. <br /> <br />The character of Bartimaeus is interesting and funny. I often caught myself laughing out loud when I was reading his little notes on the side &lt; ok on the bottom of the page >. I mean who does not chuckle at comments like \\"I once heard about a djinn that was caught in a dirty old lamp\\" &lt; we all know whom he was referring to >. His curiosity about Nathaniel and his way of thinking gives this book lot of twists and turns. Being a djinn it is obvious that Bartimaeus is able to change form in so many ways, but I found it interesting to find out how Bartimaeus feels when he takes on different forms. That staying in one form for to long actually hurts him... I mean who ever heard of a djinn that feels pain right. <br /> <br />I also liked how the book explained that there is several planes of existence and that there is ranks among the spirits. I always thought a djinn is a djinn and that is it. But according to this book there are spirits far higher in power then djinns and there are spirits who stand below djinns. &lt; Marids, Afrits, DJINN { Bartimaeus is one of those } foliots and imps >.  <br /> <br />Nathaniels story is very complex and interesting as well. Unlike Harry Potter he does not go to a school but is sent to a Wizard family where he is taught by several teachers in History and Arts, but all of magic is taught to Nathaniel by his Master. In Nathaniels Story line we are taken back and forth between past and present giving us more insight of who this young person is and why he acts the way he does.  <br /> <br />We meet a lot of characters in this book which can be a little overwhelming at times. The most important character you should remember is Simon Lovelace upon whom Nathaniel wants to take revenge after embarrassing him in front of a whole lot of higher ranking wizards.  <br /> <br />Something else you will find very interesting  is explained in the beginning of the book. It is not the wizard who has all the magical powers but the demons that that wizard controls.  <br /> <br />In all I found this book to be a very good read and would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy including not only wizards but djinns  and talisman and other magical things....  <br />
B0000DBJ2B|5.0|I found this film to be one of the most bazarre films ever made. Some of the most imaginary sets and creatures ever put together are found in this movie. Throughtout the entire film you never once find an actor or actress, everything is performed either by puppets or amazing costumes. Jim Henson and Frank Oz have only done 2 films in this genre including the (not nearly as good) Labyrinth. It to is rich with amazing sets and creature desighn but it constantly thows sappy dialogue at you and poor written songs. Dark Crystal still has some bad dialogue but originally had it's own language. Dubbing always makes things sound worse. The Jim Henson company is currently releasing Mirrormask whitch looks great and is along the same lines as Dark Crystal and Labyrinth with a higher budget.               I recently bought the Collectors Edition Dark Crystal and was somewhat dissapointed. Although the cover to the case and DVD are very cool theres only one disc with very little special features and some weird collectors pieces you probably dont want, such as: the story board, a picture to the set witch you hold to the light to see, and a letter from someone related to the movie. Also the box is so large it bulges out in every direction on the shelf. And as you can see it's a pricey item. I am still happy with my purchase but if your not a hardcore collector just by the regular version.
B000003TA4|4.0|This album isn't really groundbreaking musically, but it did bring a different aesthetic to mainstream rock music.  That said, it has good variety and a few great songs, especially Come as you are.  There aren't many songs that are just outright bad.  (maybe this version of Polly fits that description) I don't listen to this too often, but I enjoy these songs when I hear them, and it definitely brings me back.  I got into a lot of more extreme music in the meantime (Melvins, St.Vitus, Acid King, the list is extensive), but Nirvana still works for me.  It has emotional depth, it's simple but effective.   <br /> <br />Also, if you look at most of the overwhelmingly negative reviews, and click on \\"see my other reviews,\\" you'll get a pretty good idea of how much their opinions are worth.  It's laughable to think someone would place a lame band like Pearl Jam or Creed, with their ridiculous \\"yarling\\" vocalists, squeaky clean production, and trite, cliched songs, ahead of Nirvana.  But these people don't seem to get the real essence of rock and roll and find those bands easier to grasp.
1400032717|5.0|An excellent read for folks who work with autistic children.  The main character's view of the world and the events in it seems strange at first, and then completely understandable considering his \\"special needs\\".  This is a quick read, but is also a provacative novel that makes a person think with someone else's mind for a while.  I teach middle school English...if it weren't for some of the profanity, I would definitely share this with students, as I think it could be a great tool for teaching acceptance and tolerance of children with autism or Aspbergers.
B000002MIB|5.0|This album is mind-blowing, just like every other Van Halen album including the Cherone-era Van Halen 3. The sound is perfect. Sammy singing is awesome. Mike is incredible. Alex is the King of Drums. And Eddie reasserted Himself, like always, as my Hero on guitar!Heck, he's the ONLY guitarist I would consider a Super Hero on the guitar. GOD has really blessed this man with an insane amount of talent.
B000002LND|5.0|This wildly successful and popular Greatest hits pacakage is absolutley fantastic! As a huge Madonna fan, let me warn you that  a lot of true gems are left of this album such as \\"True Blue\\", and \\"Burning Up\\". However most of Madonna's biggest hits such as Cherish, Borderline, Like a Prayer, and the number one smash hit Like a Virgin do make a yummy apperance. Madonna includes 2 \\"new songs\\" on the cd ( How new is it now after 15 years), but the two original tracks recorded for the album are both winners, and defintley make one think. Madonna's controversey over her Justify my Love video being banned from MTV and Vh1 actually left a lot of ppl's eyes closed to the fantastic rhythm of the song, and the other new song recorded for the compliation \\"Rescue Me\\". Dont let your eyes be closed.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|This is a classic by Leni Riefenstahl. I like the detailed menu which lets you pick out ineresting portions of the film.
B0006L0LOS|4.0|I don't know why people didn't like this movie.  I had low expectations going in, because of the bad reviews, but I was pleasantly suprised.  Halle Berry was terrific as Catwoman.  She was sexy and confident, moving and walking just like a cat.  The leather outfit and the whip were both wicked fun.  Sharon Stone was the perfect villian.  A great blend of beauty and the beast.  Benjamin Bratt was a very nice addition with his great smile, smoldering eyes and his kind, softspoken manner.  This movie was taken way too seriously.  It was meant to be fun and lighthearted, a fantasy.  Some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, and the digital animation could have been better, but overall, it was a enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.
B00008NG5V|4.0|After the second or third listening, I fell in love with this album.  At first, I felt it was a good album, but that it lacked something exceptional.  However, after two or three listens, I found that I couldn't put it away.  It's not just good.  It is very, very good.
1400095913|4.0|The great thing about this novel is the very clearly defined voice of Dexter, the friendly neighborhood serial killer.  The author has created such a memorable character, who we like in spite of ourselves--and he has such a distinctive voice.  The story is told in the first person, and the story can admittedly get a bit flimsy sometimes.  But it doesn't matter, because Dexter's distinctive declarations (sorry, couldn't resist) are so enjoyable.  I could practically *hear* him speaking.  And with such an original idea--the author pretty much turns this genre on it's head.  I usually don't read crime novels, but made an exception for this.  Now I'm looking forward to reading the next novel in the series.
B000000H40|5.0|I remember when this first came out.  It was immediately my favorite TAPE.  Looking back, I think \\"Slowly We Rot\\" is their best...possibly my favorite death metal CD of all time.  It is perfectly evil.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Absolutely the worst piece of trash I've ever seen.  I promised myself I'd sit through it - with the hope that it just had to get better, but guess what?  It didn't get any better.    The infamous felatio at the end was gratuitous and unnecessary.  Worse still; any porno flick has better photography and technique.
B000000OQF|5.0|I love hair metal, but I've never been the most devoted fan to Guns N' Roses.  That certainly does not mean I don't respect them however.  How many bands have produced 3 epic classics on one album let alone their debut album!!!!!!! Thats incredible.  Not only do you have \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" \\"Paradise City\\" and \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", but you have other songs that are close to being equaly good such as \\"My Michelle\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone\\"  \\"So Easy\\" \\"Out ta get me\\" and \\"Thinking of You\\"  Come on people, This is a great album, the only reason I'm not thier biggest fan is because I'm into bands like Def Leppard, Scorpions and Journey.  If you're into hard well played aggressive rock, there is no better album to get then this one.
076790592X|5.0|I recommend reading this book for those who would like to live out their lives satisfied and happy. It is a remarkable creation of literature which gives lessons to writers using a personal example of the protagonist instead of excessively making-up unreal hero. <br />     Mitch Albom wrote his novel \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" to describe his teacher's last period of time after the insidious beginning of a fatal disease. Morrie Schwartz was a sociology professor at a university. Experiencing the slow progress of his dying, Morrie shared his feelings and thoughts about life and death with his friends. Having experienced his own life and having intellectually explored human relationships as a scholar, the professor instructed the future generation about culture and the meaning of life.  <br />     This novel deeply impressed me because Morrie was concerned about the same things that concern me - cultural problems. In America, people are really involved in consuming. There are many advertisements on TV, radio, and newspapers, which tell, people about money, purchases, and property, and associate them with happiness. This tempts people to buy more and more even though they don't need so much. In fact, even if they have everything, and even if they are very rich, they still are not satisfied or happy. Morrie gave us the answer as to how to solve this problem; people gain satisfaction from life only through love. Being surrounded by loving family, children, relatives and friends gives people feelings of happiness. Giving love and help to others makes people satisfied. <br />     The author arranged his book in a such a way that meeting with Morrie every Tuesday combines with his own memories about college. Because many years had passed since his graduation from the college and reuniting with his teacher, the writer describes some historical events, such as the Vietnam War and the \\"black revolution.\\" It is more interesting to read about this and observe the events troughthe eyes of the witness.  <br />     I like Mitch Albom's style of writing. It is uncomplicated and understandable to everyone even for young people. Although it might seem boring for teenagers to read philosophy of the old dying man, it would be not redundant to discuss this book in English classes in high schools. <br />     In my opinion, \\"Tuesday with Morrie\\" is one work among others novels which is worth reading for people who are not seeking for only wealth, reputation, or power, but who are concerned with human spirit and harmony with nature. <br /> <br />
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Charismatic and cute and talented and tasty. As I said in one of my album reviews if this was a meal it would satisfy the pickiest and hungriest of appetites. Dessert not necessary!
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd are an awesome band. Their 1973 album Dark Side Of The Moon is a classic, and I listen to it alot. In fact this is the best Floyd album and my favorite along with 1979's The Wall(being my second favorite album). Whenever I listen to this album I think about outer space, and the album cover is just a work of art. On this album you've got great vocals and nice guitar solos from David Gilmour, Roger Waters has got good backing vocals and great bass lines you can HEAR, beautiful atmospheric keyboarwork from Richard Wright, and good drumming from Nick Mason. The best song on here is \\"Time\\". Other great songs on here include \\"Money\\", \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\", \\"On The Run\\", \\"Us And Them\\", and \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\"(which includes nice vocals from Clare Torry). A must have for any Pink Floyd fan, classic rock, or just good music in general. Buy it now!<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Speak To Me/Breathe: 5/5<br /><br />2. On The Run: 5/5<br /><br />3. Time: 5/5(I love this song)<br /><br />4. The Great Gig In The Sky: 5/5<br /><br />5. Money: 5/5<br /><br />6. Us And Them: 5/5<br /><br />7. Any Colour You Like(instrumental): 5/5<br /><br />8. Brain Damage: 5/5<br /><br />9. Eclipse: 5/5
B00005JO3E|4.0|This is a well acted, quirky period piece with an unusual story line. Here, an English gentleman (Stephen Dillane) is looking for a weekend of fairly anonymous sex in hopes of fathering a child, as his invalid wife is not up to the task. An impoverished Swiss miss (Sophie Marceau) is desperate for money due to her family's circumstances. She passes muster during the initial interview with the English gentleman and is hired for the job of potential surrogate mother. Their nights of anonymous sex turn out to be a surprise for both of them, yet they part with the understanding that they will never again meet. Their union having proved fruitful, she ultimately gives birth to a child, their daughter, who is taken from her immediately after birth and given to the father, as contracted. For seven long years they are separated. They are then all brought together, causing upheaval and tumultuous changes in all their lives.<br /><br />This is a well acted drama with fine performances by the entire cast. The only wrong note is struck by the child who plays the seven year old daughter. She is simply odious and obnoxious, making the viewer itch to slap her. There is nothing that the child does that makes the viewer feel the child's desire for a mother. The other performers, however, more than make up for this one dimensional child actress. Moreover, the cinematography is quite beautiful, with stunning shots of a fairytale lake house. All in all, this is a film that those who love period pieces will enjoy.
0452282152|5.0|I have owned this book for 6 months and finally read it out of boredom. I started at 1030pm and couldn't put it down...I went to bed at 230am.  Now I want to read more by the author. I was engaged in Griet's plight. The descriptions were excellent, I had a visual image throughout the story, the clothing, everything - the only disappointing this is that I have the copy with the movie jacket instead of the painting. I actually feel as if I had a glimpse into a cultural history.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Several years ago, I purchased Band of Brothers on VHS format, and purchased again on DVD format. This is probably the only movie or HBO Series that I own both formats because of its excellent quality and a movie thats about as real as it gets.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|If this album were a meal you'd be going back for seconds and thirds and maybe even 4th helpings. Delectable and nutritious from first bite to last. Buble has the flavor and I'm lovin' it!
0345446798|4.0|I wanted to refresh my training skills now that I am a volunteer with an animal charity. Its been years since my current dog was a pup so I thought it best to brush up. Now I wish I'd had this book years ago! <br /> <br />The advice is practical, well explained, and from a fresh perspective. I've read many books that try to get inside a dogs head and study their behaviour, but this is the first I've read that studies OUR behaviour and tells you why you may be sending your dog messages without realizing it. <br /> <br />The first couple of techniques I tried worked a charm.  <br />I only wish the book were longer with more examples.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Having read many of the reviews of the 30th Anniversary Edition of JAWS, I can't help but wonder what many of the reviewers are thinking. First, this newest edition has more than just a couple of features not found on the 25th Anniversary Edition. The original sound mix is worth buying it! 5.1 Surround Sound isn't always the best way to watch a movie, especially one that wasn't recorded in that format to begin with!     Second, is somebody holding a gun to these reviewer's heads to make them buy this edition?? If you are that miffed about the newest edition, then DON'T buy it! As far as spending the money, I don't think it's such a bad investment to pay 14.00 (Walmart's price) every five years for a classic movie, even if it only has a few new additions to it. I thought the booklet that was included was very \\"special\\" and worth the price alone.    So...if you are having a heartattack over the 30th Anniversary Edition, just keep on walking when you see it on the store shelves. Universal won't miss your money.    p.s. How great will the JAWS Unleashed videogame be??!!! There hasn't been a Jaws videogame in more than 15 years, so all you \\"cost conscious\\" people can relax and enjoy what's to come on your PS2/Xbox on October 25, 2005!!!! :-)    CHOMP!!!!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan has done it again...maybe even better this time.  This album is awesome, it is incredible, it is fascinating.  Get it now, you need it.  His voice, the instruments, everything together is so smooth.  It's like buttah.  Up-Dang!
B00068NVI4|4.0|After reading many of the Amazon reviews for Songs From Tsongas, I was prepared for the worst, particularily with the audio...by the time I was finished watching it, my main question was \\"what are these people THINKING?!\\" The DTS Surround mix is superb on my home system, so I have no idea or explanation why other folks are having audio issues. The setlist pretty much covers Yes' entire career (although the Drama period was once again overlooked), dating all the way back to the pre-Steve Howe days. Diehard fans will appreciate some of the song selections, and should be pleased with the inclusion of the long-requested \\"Mind Drive\\". The performance isn't as furious as shows from the days of yore, but nevertheless the band is locked into a solid, comfortable groove with some occasional musical fireworks. Add the nice visuals & stage design, and you arguably have one of the strongest live Yes video releases to date.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Well, most of what I could say has been said by others, so... <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that this is one of the best productions--if not the best--ever to come from the BBC.  Strong acting, great tension, and a compelling storyline all combine to make what's become one of my favorite movies.  If you're a fan of quality historical drama, you really can't go wrong with this one. <br /> <br />
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This CD is excellent!  I am a new Jimmi Hendrix fan, but now I say: \\"where has this music been all my life?\\"  At the end of one of his songs(#10), he makes his guitar sound like seagulls taking off in flight.  I don't know how he does it, but it is amazing.  You will love every song!
B000077VR3|4.0|Moulin Rouge is like a dream.  A fresh, exuberant dream.  There are fantastical landscapes, caricature supporting characters that show depth at unexpected moments, startling juxtapositions.  There are recurring themes of truth, beauty, freedom and love.  There is the vibrant happiness that the 2 leads find in each other.  And of course the conflict that threatens to tear them apart.  Add fine acting, lively anachronistic song-and-dance numbers and stunning visuals, and you've got a film that's great entertainment.
B00007ELEL|4.0|Jeff Bridges is Jeff Lebowski, Alias \\"The Dude\\".  An unemployed, pot-smoking loser, he's the laziest person in LA - which qualifies him as one of the laziest men on Earth.  Released in the late `90's, but occurring around \\"Desert Storm\\", \\"The Big Lebowski\\" tells of The Dude's misadventures after being sucked into what appears to be a kidnapping involving his wife.  (During pot-smoking binges, little bits of The Dude's existence boil out - incl. his credit in some past Hollywood movies which doubtlessly provide for his meager and undemanding existence.)  Only, The Dude's never been married - the kidnap really involves the wife of another Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire who is everything the Dude is not.  While The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) rules from a palatial estate, The Dude's existence boils down to weed, \\"White Russians\\" and bowling with Donnie (understated Steve Buscemi) and Walter (Coen Bros. fave John Goodman).  When his rich doppelganger's complications spill over on The Dude (literally, on one of the Dude's favorite rugs), The Dude decides to take the fight over to the big man himself - necessarily getting himself sucked into Big Lebowski's machinations.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the best laid plans of mice, men and two Lebowskis are steamrolled by Walter - a one-man weapon of mass destruction.  Early on we see how far Walter will go to protect his ideals on bowling, and he soon buts his way into the schemes of the two Lebowskis to the frustration of everybody.  The Coen brothers's script tosses in a squad of nihilists (including indie rocker Aimee Mann), a master pornographer (Ben Gazzara), theft of the Dude's car, various hallucinations involving bowling, Big Lebowski's affected performance-artist of a Daughter (Julianne Moore) and a mysterious stranger played by Sam Elliot. <br /> <br />It's easy to dismiss this flick as a Coen Bros. version of \\"The Big Sleep\\" - the parallels are there in terms of plot and spirit.  (I prefer to view it an unofficial Coen Bros. sequel to \\"Tron\\", in which the ordered existence of cyberspace of the first movie has been eroded as mankind has begun to stumble into it via the worldwide web.  When you compare the people involved in programming in '82 to those involved in cyberspace by Netscape's IPO, it's not a difficult image.)  While others have easily written this off as a comedy of mistaken identity, it's more accurate to praise this flick as a shining example of the mistake-of-identity - nobody is what they seem by the end of the flick: despite his pot smoking, The Dude will experience moments of lucidity; Walter will adhere to Orthodox Judaism even though he's Polish Catholic, and by the end of the flick will give a eulogy for a character that has nothing to do with that character; Donnie will wear numerous personalized shirts - none of which actually bear his name; a flamboyant bowler named \\"Jesus\\" will be revealed to be a sex-offender; neither Lebowski nor his \\"wife\\" are what they seem; the nihilists aren't all that nihilistic. <br /> <br />At the heart of the movie is a conflict between the Chandler-style plot (which begins to unravel) and the movie's will to be another fun, if preposterous Coen Brothers movie in the vein of \\"Oh Brother\\" and \\"Raising Arizona\\".  At some point, the Coens win out over Chandler, but that leaves the winners with a hollow shell of a movie - which retroactively becomes as rootless and inconsequential as The Dude himself.  In short, it's a fun flick that you shouldn't be ready to look into as deeply as I have.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Quite simply this movie was a complete let down from the other two movies in this series.  Anthony Hopkins does a good job once again in his role as Hannibal.  Julianne Moore had some big shoes to fill trying to match Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  She fell far short of what I would have liked to have seen. <br /> <br />I must say this movie is better than the book.  It felt as though Thomas Harris had a deadline to meet and he rushed out a sloppy product.  I think while doing research in Italy he stopped for some absinth in the Czech Republic.  While researching in the U.S. he stopped in the woods of West Virginia for some moonshine.  I feel sorry for the producer because he was given so little to work with and thankfully changed the ending. <br /> <br />The premise behind this movie is that Hannibal is living the good life in Italy with a museum curator job that fits his tastes (well most of them).  He is discovered and put on the run again.  He is subsequently hunted by Verger, a former patient and victim of his.  Verger wants to see Hannibal eaten by a bunch of pigs, I guess he couldn't get the sharks with laser beams either. <br /> <br />This movie is not a thriller of any sort.  It goes out of its way to find disgusting scenes.  Where the Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs used the viewer's imagination this film puts it all on the screen.  To its credit it does have a lot of awesome footage of Europe. <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Whether you label her as Country, Pop, Rock...it doesn't really matter, the fact of the matter is that Shania makes fantastic music! <br />Very rarely now does an album fully come together in the finished form of something that is excellent from start to finish but Shania is one of those artists who can do that in her sleep. <br />Throughout this album Shania's vocals are emotional, soulful, packed with charisma and attitude and all of her songs have perfectly crafted slick production. <br /> <br />The timing of her Greatest Hits was easily due considering how many great songs she has under her belt already and I forsee many more Greatest Hits albums in her future.  <br />Everything about Shania is quality, from her music to her concert performing ability, no female does it better!
B0002OERI0|1.0|I dont understand why people think this album is so good.  1) Green Day started there genre of punk years and years ago and were popular because of it. they dissapear in in that time bands start merging out of every corner creating the same sound. Gree Day come bank and in my opinion are just one of those bands thrying to copy that old Green Day. i hope that mkaes sence.    2) Making an album about war and making fun of the President died out like 2 years ago, there a bit late on that fad!    3) the are all dirty old men with too much make up    justin pape  (...)
0062502182|4.0|When you read this book you can immediately realize that it is a very simplistic fable. However, the greatness of the human mind depends on its capacity to extract and link concepts seemingly unrelated. That is the essence of the human intelligence. I do not agree with those who harshly criticize this book. It is great, if are willing to grasp what the author is trying to convey to you. It is about following a dream and the power of will. I am convinced that everyone must believe in his/her power to achieve their goals and this book will definitely inspire you if you are willing to listen and if you are willing to relax when you read it.
B00005JLKN|4.0|A lot of people insist that the original movie Manhunter was far superior than this movie.  I am forced to disagree.  In this film the characters are far more gruesome.  Their is no real sense of fear or awe of Hannibal in Manhunter.  In the Red Dragon Anthony Hopkins reprises his role and does an awesome job of it. <br /> <br />Edward Norton plays Will Graham the agent that caught Hannibal Lecter.  He is brought out of retirement to hunt down the latest serial killer \\"the tooth fairy\\" played superbly by Ralph Fiennes.  Fiennes gives the tooth fairy the haunting presence that Manhunter sorely lacked.  The movie basically follows Graham's hunt for the tooth fairy as well as visiting with Hannibal on several occasions for help.  It is a good movie that would have deserved 5 stars if it were not for the Silence of the lambs being so superbly done.
B000002LGQ|4.0|like a prayer is one of madonna's best songs ever. actyually it probably is my favorite one from her. also the other big highlight on this album is &quot;promise to try&quot; its so...BEAUTIFUL! i love it, deinfitely her best slow song.  The other good songs are &quot;express yourself&quot; and &quot;love song&quot; and theres some other good htis too those are just the ones at the top of my head.  madonna's older work was definitly much better than her newer stuff  (i hate her song she does for james bond) but other than that she a telented artist!
B000002N3N|5.0|According to me Watermark, Shepherd Moons and The Memory Of Trees represent Enya's golden trio. They complement each other in a perfect way and her music is both beautiful and powerful. The CD covers are also very beautiful and poetic. My personal favourite on The Memory Of Trees is her well known hit Anywhere Is, but the album contains lots of great tracks such as the title track (perhaps her best instrumental track so far), Pax Deorum, Athair Ar Neamh, China Roses, Tea-House Moon and On My Way Home. The Memory Of Trees is perfect to play in autumn and winter when the darkness falls. I promise you it will be a moment full of feelings.     Here comes a short description of the tracks on The Memory Of Trees:     1. The Memory Of Trees - Instrumental; great, very beautiful, special*   2. Anywhere Is - English; great, wonderful, special*   3. Pax Deorum - Latin & Gaelic; great, pretty powerful, special*   4. Athair Ar Neamh - Gaelic; very beautiful, special*   5. From Where I Am - Instrumental; beautiful, relaxing   6. China Roses - English; very beautiful, special*   7. Hope Has A Place - English; very beautiful, relaxing, special*   8. Tea-House Moon - Instrumental; very beautiful, relaxing   9. Once You Had Gold - English; beautiful, relaxing   10. La Soadora - Spanish; beautiful, special*   11. On My Way Home - English; great, beatuiful, special*     * Hard to say why these songs are special, but perhaps because they don't sound like any other musical stuff. There's only one person that's able to create songs like these and her name is - Enya. You must hear them, but don't forget to try her other albums such as Watermark and Shepherd Moons.
0446677450|5.0|When I first read the title of this book, the first thing I though was... How do I classify my father? As rich, as middle class? It made me think so I bought it. In a nutshell, Kiyosaki says that whatever puts money in your wallet is an asset and what does not is a liability. This challenges the traditional view that things like a house or a luxurious car are assets. Many people would feel uncomfortable by hearing that, however, it is true. If you do not believe it or do not think he has a point, read the book. Kiyosaki also challenges many other views that make a lot of sense, things like getting more and more educated when looking for a better life standard or a greater income. This, as he points out, was the winning formula for the past few generations; however, today it is a different story. Fifty years ago, having a college education gave you great opportunities because many technical and scientific skills were scarce, thus the demand for those with education and greater skills was greater. This is not the case nowadays; the labor supply has gotten bigger and bigger so this cannot be a winning formula across countries. A different view and attitude is needed, especially an entrepreneurial one.  <br />I STRONGLY recommend it for everyone, especially for young people who are starting to study at college and who may dream of getting rich just right after getting their diplomas. <br />
B000002LMM|5.0|I first heard a song from this soundtrack (other than hearing it on the show and film) when walking in a local mall, and suddenly the crappy, lame mall became cool and surreal.  This soundtrack can do this for any place you play it.
B000069CWE|4.0|Alot of people consider this to be the evil twin of Hybrid Theory. You can say that but I don't care.  Reanimation is a bit more advanced then Hybrid theory and there's alot of underground musicians in here. Half of it is rock and half of it is rap But it makes it better.  Some of remixes are a bit worse then the original.  Some are about as good as some are much better. Alot of them sound even completely different (also with altered lyrics) then from the original hybrid theory as well.  <br /> <br />Ente E ND could have been better.  Its much more rap and has no rock feeling to it at all.  They changed the lyrics.  If you are really into rap you'll love this song.  But I was a bit disapointed since the orignal one was all the hype in the first one and I think it was much better.  The ones that I think are much better than the original is the bymself remix, with you remix, and the pushing me away remix.  They got a whole lot better. <br /> <br />My favorites are P5hing me A-wy, the my december, and with you. <br /> <br />Also a real treat is that linkin park  managed to add remix tracks from the japanese imported hybrid theory (my december, high voltage) that is not included in the U.S. ones.  If you are a linkin park fan I highly recommend you buy this if you have hybrid theory.  Remixes are nice to listen to for a change, and fortunetly this one won't be that disapointing.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful throughout which is undoubtedly due a combination of Harrison's own introspection and Spector's \\"Walls of Sound\\" production. For me, the album reaches its artistic climax with the \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp\\" (the title words are sung in a deep bass-line voice that nearly got lost on my '70's player). The album is punctuated with many lighter moods such as \\"Apple Scruffs\\". A \\"must own\\" classic.  <br /> <br />Even the bonus tracks are a great addition to the set and \\"I Live For You\\" is so outstanding and absolutely essential that I really don't understand why it was left out of the 3-LP released in 1970. <br /> <br />I actually love the much knocked \\"Apple Jam\\" third LP disc, which are in a way reminiscent of early 70, bluesy songs from group like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Derek& the Dominoes etc, but much more crafted. No freaking out and long, fast guitar solos, but really an excellent jam, with professional musicians, which did not annoy me. People didn't understand him - even today - the reason behind including the \\"Apple Jam\\". I Think George showed us with the \\"Apple Jam\\" that life is also fresh, spontaneous and worth delighting. <br /> <br />This reissue has been remastered, not remixed, making the sound clearer although the songs do not suddenly sound noticeably different, as on the recent reissues of John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and Imagine. Depending on your viewpoint, that is a refreshing change. I was very impressed with the remixes of the aforementioned Imagine and POB CDs but, then again, ATMP has been reissued exactly as George originally wanted us to hear it, and obviously how he still wants us to hear it. <br /> <br />Overall George Harrison shines as a brilliant songwriter the melodys are haunting, and the production exciting. This really is testament to the great songwriting talent of George Harrison, and out of the shadow of John and Paul, he produced THE Beatle-solo masterpiece!  <br /> <br />God bless George and Phil for lasting this long to remind us what great music is all about.  <br />
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World is a novel that with a girl's story explains how western philosophy was developed since its beginning. It is interesting to know how philosophy evolved over the centuries and who made the greatest contributions to this science. You certainly can skip many details of the story and make it a fast read if that troubles you. If you are interested in the history of philosophy this is a nice book to start with.
068484267X|3.0|Angela's Ashes is a great story of Frank McCourt's childhood in Ireland. The experiences and anecdotes that he tells the reader are horrific, hillarious and every degree in between those extremes. However, the way that McCourt recounts his story is done in a way that was tiring to me as a reader. The writing style is so bland. It has no color, no excitement and no way of holding my attention for very long. I had to take this book in very small doses. The writing in the first 15 or so pages is the only part of the book in which the reader is reading the writing of a mature adult. The rest is told through the eyes of an innocent child. Granted, this does have some possitive effects on the book, particularly when McCourt's parents withold the facts of life from their children. However, because of this writing style everything is a euphemism. Not sex, but knee-trembler. Not masturbating, but \\"going at yourself.\\" This makes for a tiring read, not an enjoyable one. For me, any books' enjoyment relies greatly on the writing style and the manner in which the author tells the story, not the story itself. That's why this book was just a little too bland for my tastes. A slow read, not because it was a hard read, but because I would grow weary after about twenty pages. If you really want to consider reading this book, take a passage out of the middle of the book and read at it for a while. If the writing style seems too childish, you won't enjoy this book very much.
B000957O82|5.0|Ok so you are probably wondering what I thought of this move ... I know I know .... don't hold back ... <br /> <br /> <br />This is a great story and the perfect vehicle for Will Smith to play the cool and world smart tutor for men who have no hope in the world of ever developing a relationship with a woman. Needless to say when he meets up with a hard as nails local gossip reporter all of his professional skils are tested to the limit ...... <br /> <br /> <br />This is definitely a 'date' movie or one could say a 'chick flick' but trust me it's a hoot and the viewer never really knows wher in the world the story is going ... <br /> <br /> <br />It certainly has been a long time since I thoroughly enjoyed a great story, great movien and great acting ....
6304119046|5.0|I'll just make a few quick comparisons with \\"the competition.\\"  Some of my criteria for \\"greatness\\" will be explicit, some implicit.  These, of course, are just my opinions, but that's what this forum is for: to exchange opinions.  First, I think a great film isn't merely escapist; it has to give us some insight into our reality, just as a great work of literature does.  For that reason, I'll drop popular favorites such as Wizard of Oz, It's a Wonderful Life, Star Wars, E.T., etc. out of the running.  Delightful as they are, they don't offer a whole lot to mature, reality-based interests.  Casablanca?  It features a wonderful script and acting, but the direction is nothing special and certainly not innovative.  It's a great film if you want \\"a good story,\\" but it doesn't offer much in the way of sustenence for the mind or cinematic artistry.  The American films that compete most directly with Kane in terms of sheer cinematic brilliance, such as Vertigo and 2001, are genre pictures with fantastic elements; they don't go to the heart of American civilization the way Kane does.  Ultimately, I don't think they offer as much, even though they offer quite a lot.  So what other film combines cinematic brilliance with thematic depth in such generous helpings?  The \\"New American\\" films of the late 60s and 70s give one a lot to pick from and certainly dig deep into the American experience.  Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown, and the first two Godfathers are all obviously great films, but all belong to clearly defined genres (gangster picture, film noir) instead of transcending genre the way Kane does.  And their view of life is more bleak and one-sided than Kane's is.  To my way of thinking, they aren't as grand or as generous.  The constraints of genre also apply to the great musicals like Singin' in the Rain and the great westerns like My Darling Clementine and The Searchers (which are very great pictures indeed!).  Nashville, The Last Picture Show, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull transcend genre and explore complex American realities.  But their subject matter is more limited and less universal (country music, small-town life, urban psychosis, boxing) than Kane's (politics, business, media).  And one-sided bleakness is again a limitation with so many of the better films from that era, which lack the comic and nostalgic elements of Kane.  It has been mostly downhill since, as we enter the age of spectacle over substance.  I might pick Raging Bull as #2 for its stunning and uncompromising brilliance, but LaMotta is a dwarf of a human compared to Kane--a truly great man (externally) and a fit subject for tragedy.  He's an American equivalent, if you will, of a Shakespearean antihero: articulate, charismatic, self-conscious, and deeply flawed.  Kane, by my estimate, not only surpasses the competition in terms of cinematic and thematic qualities (i.e., human interest), but it also has one of the great screenplays and an original one at that--not a mere literary adaptation like Gone with the Wind, Grapes of Wrath, etc. etc.  Then, add to that an innovative flashback narrative, a great cast of characters played by some first-rate actors, one of the great scores (by the very great Bernard Herrmann), and some phenomenal make-up artistry (Welles himself is aged so convincingly, it has held up completely over the years--give credit here to his immense acting ability as well).  So there you have a few reasons why I agree with those who rank Citizen Kane #1 among American films.  Actually, if the studio hadn't butchered The Magnificent Ambersons (Welles's next project) it would probably be the toughest competition: Welles himself thought it was the better picture.  But in its diminished form I don't think it can be considered as great, wonderful as its fragments undeniably are.  Is Kane a \\"thinking person's film\\"?  Yep.  The more you think about it and analyze it, the more you'll get out of it.  But it has a huge heart too, and that's what keeps us comingback.

B0000214F0|4.0|It all began by my being really bored in my High School Social Studies class, where the teacher would go on and on about the greatness of Western society, that finally made me really take a look at world history for what it was.  <br /> <br />In class, we studied the Greeks and the Romansd and the greatness of their contributions to a civilized society. I followed thius up with a long trip to the library and found out that greatness was produced by a bunch of freaks. <br /> <br />What this film did was simply put a visual action to the descriptions of their societies, buried deep within the stacks of the New York Public Library. <br /> <br />Each time I thought that I had seen the grossest thing possible, the next scene would top it.
B00006469V|4.0|This is the recording that Alan Bates as the hero of Simon Gray's play 'Otherwise Engaged' kept trying to listen to, but kept getting interrupted before he could get beyond a few bars.<br /><br />What he would have heard if he'd got to the end would have been perhaps the best sung of all Parsifals. The cast is a starry one (certainly for its time) and they all acquit themselves with more than usual credit.<br /><br />Top of the list belongs to Gottlob Frick singing this Gurnemanz as his swansong to the recording studio. If you think of him only as the pitch black villains of Walkure and Gotterdammerung or the authoritarian rulers of Lohengrin and Tannhauser, think again. This is a warmly wise mature Knight of the Grail whose every word and musical phrase is deeply considered and sung with meaning and understanding. No garrulous old bore, this. Fischer-Dieskau, too, brings all his experience of lieder singing to bear on the text and the music. This Amfortas is no mere cypher, but an honourable, flawed and deeply anguished man. Christa Ludwig presents all the sharply contrasted facets of this profoundly complex character to her portrayal of Kundry. Maybe she lacks just the last volt of electricity generated by Martha Modl in Act 2. The one slightly weak link in this estimable array is Rene Kollo, a rather bland Parsifal with insufficient distinction between the 'reine Tor' who erupts on the scene in Act 1 and the wiser, older, world-weary black knight who trudges into the final Act. A glance down the cast list reveals strength in depth right down to a list of Flowermaidens that includes Kiri te Kanawa and Lucia Popp.<br /><br />As for the conducting, Solti is Solti - exciting, precise, a little hard-driven at times and inclined to be episodic. As always, he draws ravishing sounds from the Vienna Philharmonic and his familiar Decca engineers do him proud by the standards of the day.<br /><br />This is certainly a candidate for a top recommendation Parsifal with its great singing cast and its (relatively) modern sound. Personally, though, I'd go back to the 1951 Knappertsbusch and settle for the more dated sound.at singing cast and its (relatively) modern sound.

B00003CX9E|1.0|Of course everyone has a right to their opinion.  If you love this film and revere it as many have done, wonderful.  If you don't like it, like me, then respect that opinion.  Not everyone is \\"intellectually minded\\".  There are those of us who feel with their heart and not with their head.  I am one of those people.  That's why I cannot get into Citizen Kane.  I tried to view it objectively and I just cannot get into the \\"art\\" aspect of this film.  I'm not going to say it is overrated or underrated.  For me, this film is not one I would ever want to see again or ever buy.  It took me 3 days to watch it as I could only watch it during 15 minute intervals.  That is all I could take.  Again, this is my opinion and I respect those that hold this film dear and love it.  I'm sorry that I'm not one of those.

Still, it was a page-turner. <br />
B00003Q43A|4.0|This movie has a really cool base plot, over-the-top special effects, and an ending that is nearly plausible.  The pacing of the movie is so fast that you tend to forget that the movie is full of far too convenient coincidences and more lucky breaks than any one race should deserve.  Regardless of how many times I have seen this movie, I am always up for one more.<br /><br />Our main characters see some strange things at the beginning of the movie.  It turns out that the strange things are aliens entering our atmosphere.  The generation that grew up with \\"E.T.\\" and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" decides that the best thing to do is to say hello to the new neighbors.  However, it appears that our alien visitors are more akin to the aliens of \\"Starship Troopers\\" than to E.T.  We eventually learn that the aliens have two things in mind; our extermination and the rape of our planet.<br /><br />However, because we have lots of macho, manly, men running about, we are not going to wait for the aliens to exterminate us.  We have President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman, who has had a number of experiences with a variety of creatures, such as reptiles in \\"Lake Placid,\\" scary dead people in \\"The Grudge,\\" ghosts in \\"Casper,\\" and Sandra Bullock in \\"While You Were Sleeping\\"), David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, who managed to hold dinosaurs at bay with biting wit in two \\"Jurassic Park\\" movies), Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith, who has more macho in his little finger than most guys in their whole body), General William Grey (Robert Loggia, who just exudes macho, in a grandfatherly sort of way) and Russell Casse (Randy Quaid, who has lots of macho, it's just hard to find), along with a cast of hundreds of other macho people (including some women) who gamely sacrifice themselves to beat off the alien attack.<br /><br />Things initially look pretty hopeless.  The aliens have a game play and they are sticking to it.  Everything looks like they are on a tight schedule, and the aliens smack our high tech equipment as though they were gnats, and ignore nuclear weapons as though they were nothing more than a brief puff of wind.  Ah, but we know something the aliens do not.  Well, a couple of somethings.  First, we have all the macho, manly, men.  Second, we have a spacecraft that crashed in Roswell, and it is kept in the place that does not really exist, Area 51.<br /><br />How can we combine the two things that we have and end up with an alien exterminating play?  Well, it helps to have wise Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch, who has little alien experience), David's father.  An amazingly simple statement by Julius suddenly triggers a brilliant thought in David, and bingo, a solution to the alien problem is created.  Of course, we need aspiring astronaut Captain Steve Hiller to fly the spacecraft to the alien mother ship so that David's computer (with homage to HAL-9000 on it) can talk to the alien computer.  They also are carrying a nuclear missile to attempt to wreak a little havoc on the alien mother ship.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is aerial battles and a huge self-sacrifice that makes you want to salute an American flag somewhere.<br /><br />This movie is full of corn and coincidence, and yet it is darn fun to watch.  The action is so fast that you rarely have a chance to think too much about the numerous coincidences, or that your emotions are being deliberately manipulated.  Unless you spend too much time analyzing movies, especially science fiction movies, and you like a lot of action, then I think you would absolutely love this movie.he aliens smack our high tech equipment as though they were gnats, and ignore nuclear weapons as though they were nothing more than a brief puff of wind.

I'll admit that I was not thrilled with the remixes (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but the entire CD is well worth the money.

0684800713|5.0|In a course I took on the American literature of the 1920s, the professor began his discussion of \\"The Sun also Rises\\" by calling our attention to a minor, sidebar scene: Jake and Georgette promenade in in Paris in the early evening past the window of the Herald Tribune offices.  Jake explains to Georgette that the clocks displayed in the window show the hour in each of the four time zones across America. Georgette, who is a prostitute from Belgium, looks at the clocks in the window and says: \\"Don't kid me.\\" <br /> <br />It is an odd little scene, and on the face of it doesn't make sense.  But it is the key to the book.  The novel is about time and death.  For Georgette and Jake, who are survivors of the 1914-18 war, time doesn't exist in the traditional sense.  For the survivors of the war, as for the dead, time is understood to be over.  <br /> <br />In the 19th century, most Americans considered the passage of time to be a metronome of human progress.  The equation of time with progress was a form of  boosterism, born from the great success of the industrial revolution and the Westward expansion of the country.  As time went on, things got bigger, better, faster, richer and further West.  Time and progress were synonymous.  <br /> <br />For the war generation, this naively optimistic view of time and industrial progress ended abruptly and in it ended in violence.  It seemed that industrial progress had paid itself off in the industrialization of death - the machine gun, the French 75s, the recoilless artillery of Krupp.  <br /> <br />The Great War was not a gallant, romantic, sabers on horseback conflict like that depicted in late 19th century newspaper accounts of the Spanish American war.  The Great War of 1914-18 came to be seen, from the point of view of writers in the 1920s, as an unfair fight between men and (indifferent, impersonal, efficient) killing machines. A highly mechanized slaughterhouse. <br /> <br />Hemingway's generation, the so-called \\"lost generation,\\" was lost in fact.  A generation died in the war.  The statistics of mortality were for those days stunning and incredible.  <br /> <br />The novel is set in Paris around 1924, six years after the armistice.  For the characters who were soldiers or survivors like Jake and Georgette, the daily circuit of the sun is a clock without purpose.  Time is meaningless to them, just as it is to the dead.  Hence, the sun \\"also\\" rises.  It happens every morning of course but it is an event that occurs off to one side.  It does not bring the hope of a new dawn, it does not mean \\"life goes on.\\"  In this novel, emphatically, life does not go on - there is no progress.   <br /> <br />The war survivors' perception of time has shrunk to the present moment, in which they live.  They elaborately avoid looking back - the war is just a huge hole in their personal stories -- and they cannot look forward, in the sense of \\"looking forward to\\" a superior future. For the survivors of the war, time has been turned around, flipped.  Death has already happened - it is behind them.   They do see the sun rise and set.  But although time passes, it does not really go anywhere.    <br /> <br />The passage of time into a brighter future, the progress of the sun through a succession of time zones across the US from east to west - all this strikes the Belgian survivor, Georgette, as utter nonsense. \\"Don't kid me.\\" She says.  <br /> <br />The war is the silent, unmentionable core of The Sun Also Rises, but the characters sometimes mention it inadvertently, in asides, and the reader gets tiny glimpses of what happened to these people the war, and what it did to them.   <br /> <br />They never move forward. Writers start, or fail to start, books that they never finish.  Love affairs lead to nothing, no marriages and no babies.  There is a constant theme of drinking to coast through the present and to forget the past.  Another diversion is an obsessive concentration on the sensual minutia of the present moment.  Jake, a former combat pilot who has suffered some sort of wound to his groin, never detailed, is outside of time in the biological sense that he cannot reproduce.  He has lost his \\"line\\", that is, the line of familial and biological continuity between past and future. <br /> <br />Conflicts in the book frequently arise as mutually amazed confrontations between Americans who skipped the war, and still have their 19th century sense of optimism and progress and honor intact -- and the \\"new\\" Americans like Hemingway - expatriates from American space but, more importantly, from the old American sense of time as something positive.  In what has probably become the most famous line in the book Jakes says: \\"I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together.\\"   As an American war veteran, Jake himself has a huge rip through his own story.  <br /> <br />This year, The Sun Also Rises is 80 years old.  Frozen in time, exactly as Hemingway intended.   A difficult, complicated book that is, nevertheless, very easy to read.  <br />

B0000A02U2|4.0|If Looney Tunes wasn't a cartoon, this movie would be the result. While I went to college in the mid Seventies rather than the mid-Sixties, I can identify with almost every aspect of this movie. I was surrounded by crazy characters who thought nothing of committing insane acts of mayhem for the sheer fun of it. We also seemed to consume massive amounts of alcohol but threw in a large amount of drugs. This is not a movie about being in college. It's a movie about surviving college. In the wildest fashion possible. I love this movie. I've been watching it since it hit the theaters, and I will probably never tire of it. It's a trip down memory lane for me.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I have had to express my thoughts on the most modern rock albums to people recently. On radio and other media outputs there is very little work that progress and push forward the arts and music. Incubus' Morning View album is what I find to be one of the best music complitations of the Modern Rock era.<br /><br />What has inspired me in my own musical recordings and compliations are Incubus' oriental/spiritual feelings from their songs 'Aqueous Transmittion' and 'Echo' - two songs that have keep their essence with me ever since the album came out.<br /><br />As a whole, the album has been beautifully recorded and mastered, levels are seemingly perfect, recording styles, guitar editing, and drums have similarily been done very well. I consider this album to be one of three modern rock albums to be the most amazing in comparison with what has been done in the last 10 years with modern rock. The other two would be Third Eye Blind's Blue and Coldplay's Parachutes - each with their own unique and heavily though-out recording and compositional styles. There are very few modern rock albums that compare with these albums, including the Morning View album.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I was at this show. I was very honored that Yes would film a special show in my home town. I have never seen them live before and, to be truthful, I didn't know what to expect. How many bands that have been around for 35+ years and still sound good without a second band backing them up? What? the Stones! Dream on. Everybody sounded wonderfull. Jon Anderson tenor voice was so nice to hear. He is also a very good frontman who knows how to talk to the audience and a very good back up musican. It was great to see Steve Howe, one of my favorite guitar players. He can still play. I was funny to see his slide guitar roll away from him. We all need a little Spinal Tap in our life. Mr.'s Squire and White provided a incredible rhythm section. I can't say enough about them. Rick Wakeman played very well. One of the best keyboardist of all time but he had a sour puss on his face most of the night. He did seem to lighten up during the acoustic set.  <br />What I like about the show is when they played songs I did not know I wasn't bored one bit. If you like this tour, pick the 35th A' triple CD. It's a great companion piece. <br />Again, I felt really fortunate to see this show. If your a fan of Yes at all, you will not be disapointed.

B000ASATYO|5.0|In the early 1960's, a serial killer named Johnny Charles Bartlett (played BRILLIANTLY by Jake Busey) scores himself a record of killings (\\"That's one more than Starkweather!\\", he brags), with the help of his teenage girlfriend Patricia Ann Bradley (played by Dee Wallace-Stone). Twenty-something years later, Dr. Lucy Lynskey pays a visit to Patricia, in order to doctor some of her wounds. Patricia tells Lucy about her past, and why she has to keep Johnny's ashes in her room. Patricia's mother snaps at Lucy, making her leave. Psychic-investigator Frank Bannister (played wonderfully by Michael J. Fox), who can see deceased souls thanks to a accident he was in 5 years ago that killed his wife, by the help of his ghostly friends, Cyrus (Chi McBride) and Stuart (Jim Fyfe), and an undead judge (John Astin), earns a living working cases that involve objects moving around the room, toilet seats banging, water faucets turning on and off, etc. One day, Bannister acidentally scatters his business cards all over the car, and winds up crashing into a fence. He meets the owner, Ray Lynskey, who is angry at what has happened. He makes an offer to pay for the fence while giving Ray his business card. Later on, Bannister's friendly ghosts decide to frighten Ray, and his wife Lucy. Lucy decides to call Frank over, and Frank does a fake test, scoring himself another paycheck. Bannister and his friends quit fooling people when he starts noticing real hauntings around town: citizens dying mysteriously. Frank can see a figure, who looks like the grim reaper, crushing hearts of certain citizens, and then places a number on their foreheads. Lucy becomes one of the unlucky victims of one of the killings. She believes Frank has psychic abilities when her husband (who is now deceased) questions Frank about what happend to him. Ray asks Frank to invite Lucy to dinner, in order to be able to speak to her. Lucy joins Bannister in order to get to the bottom of what's happening. However, all of the killings point to Bannister, but Bannister soon figures out that Johnny Bartlett is \\"alive\\". Enter in FBI agent Investigator Dammers (played by Jeffrey Combs), a paranoid man who gets \\"all of the fruity cases\\". While Dammers and Patricia try to stop Frank and Lucy, it's up to Frank, Lucy, and his dead friends to take down Johnny.<br /><br />In the late 90's, Universal released the theatrical cut of this film on a barebones DVD, so I for one am glad to see that we finally get to own the Director's Cut, which hasn't been seen since the director's cut of the film was released on Laserdisc in 1998. The Director's Cut includes approximately 12 minutes of additional footage. As far as I know, this DVD release is going to be a single disc. Hopefully Universal changes that in order to include all of the great laserdisc extras.<br /><br />Laserdisc special features:<br /><br />  * Director's cut includes approximately 12 minutes of additional footage<br />  * Feature commentary by director Peter Jackson<br />  * 4 hour documentary 'The Making Of The Frighteners' directed by Peter Jackson featuring cast interviews, rehearsals, storyboarding, miniatures and special effects<br />  * Deleted scenes and bloopers<br />  * Rehearsals<br />  * Theatrical trailer<br /><br />I hope Universal gives us the goodies. As for my comments on this release: \\"IT'S ABOUT TIME!\\"<br /><br />DVDanswers.com says this:<br /><br />This single-disc special edition will be released on November 29th. The runtime of the DC is 2 hours and 3 minutes. The film itself will be presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with an English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track.<br /><br />9/2/2005:<br />Just a little update on the extras for the Director's Cut of The Frighteners on DVD. The following is from davisDVD.com<br /><br />\\"Universal Studios has added the wording \\"includes over four hours of bonus material written and produced by Peter Jackson\\" to their listing of The Frighteners Director's Cut. Does this mean the DVD will include the complete documentary from the laserdisc box set? Very possible. There will be enough room on the DVD-18 (dual-layered, dual-sided) for the film and the documentary. However, if Universal counts the two-hour commentary track as part of the bonus materials, the documentary may be split in half. It's certainly happened before (*cough* Jaws), so it may be the case again.

B0000028M7|5.0|One of the darkest albums in the history of music, and without a doubt one of the real greats of the alternative movement as well as the greatest acheivement by the band, Alice in Chains' \\"Dirt\\" is an essential album, and one where all the pieces finally came together.  Seemelessly integrating the band's two sides, the album is a moody and dark masterpiece, exploring such topics as despair, loneliness, addiction, and suicide.  And yet, remarkably, the album avoids falling into any of the traps that such subjects can lead to. <br /> <br />\\"Dirt\\" opens similar to \\"Facelift\\", with a blast of metal in \\"Them Bones\\".  but something catches your attention right away-- the verses are sung in harmony, with vocalist Layne Staley and guitarist Jerry Cantrell singing in harmony.  It works, it makes the piece stand out, and it makes it quite frankly better than anything on the band's debut. <br /> <br />But \\"Dirt\\" isn't so much about driving metal as the debut is, but rather covers a number of different sounds and feels.  Take moody piece \\"Rain When I Die\\".  Now clearly any song with this title isn't going to be exactly cheery, but Alice captures something else-- vocalist Layne Staley isn't depressed, he's morbid, and the music supports this.  This is a common theme, with the suicide-themed title track, drug reflection \\"Hate to Feel\\", and the positively stunning \\"Down in a Hole\\" expounding upon this mood. <br /> <br />Still, while this record is never really a cheery affair, there's another side-- Vietnam reflection \\"Rooster\\" follows the Seattle-sound soft-loud formula to great effect, and \\"Would?\\" (about the overdose death of Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood) is nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of the best albums of the Seattle movement, and is essential listening.  Newcomers to the band should start here.  Highly recommended.
B000A158SI|3.0|Sure the special effects are discouraging but, who could of better been cast as the reluctant hero than Bruce Campbell? This film has cheaply thrown in nudity and unusual amounts of blood give it that early 80's horror film feeling, and an NC-17 rating. It's easy to pick out flaws and inconsistencies throughout the film, but thats not the point. The point is to make you laugh, and then scare your pants off.<br /><br />The UMD for this film presents the film in a hard-matted 1.78:1 ratio, which is fine for this film, due to the fact that this film was filmed in 1.33:1. The UMD doesn't contain any bonus features either. Basically, you're getting a barebones version of this film for PSP.
B000002B2X|3.0|Totally unprecedented by their debut album, Alice in Chains' \\"Sap\\", a four-song EP that preceeded the release of their dark masterpiece \\"Dirt\\", is a great little record.  Named due to a dream had by drummer Sean Kinney (he dreamed they held a press conference to announce their upcoming record, \\"Sap\\"), the band abandons the electric guitars and noise of their debut for acoustic rock full of vocal harmonies.  Guitarist Jerry Cantrell steps up and sings leads for the first time and the band is augmented by vocals from Ann Wilson (of Heart) and on one piece Chris Cornell (of Soundgarden) and Mark Arm (of Mudhoney). <br /> <br />Opener \\"Brother\\" sets the stage-- strummed acoustic guitars dominate the piece, and rather than vocalist Layne Staley's angry wail, Cantrell steps up and sings the lead, softly intoning his haunting lyrics, with Staley and Wilson providing support on the choruses.  Admittedly, for me the rest of the album doesn't quite live up to this piece-- \\"Am I Inside\\" is similar in mood, but isn't as strong a piece, \\"Right Turn\\" is a lot of fun, with Cantrell, Staley, Arm and Cornell all taking turns at lead vocal, and \\"Got Me Wrong\\" ended up being a hit a couple years later, but to be honest isn't one of the band's finest moments.  It's always struck me as kind of a throwaway. <br /> <br />The extra track is called \\"Love Song\\"-- it's a lot of fun, though I won't seriously discuss it. <br /> <br />Invariably, this album set the stage for \\"Dirt\\" as much as \\"Facelift\\" did, featuring a more introspective view of the band, and while I don't find the material particularly gripping (although when I first heard this, I played it to death), it's certainly an interesting detour along the way.
0515125024|4.0|Jack Reacher books are some of the most fun thriller books out there.  This one follows Reacher who happens to be next to an FBI agent who is kidnapped by some pretty crazy people.  They happen to nab him also, and he must use all of his skills to defeat these enemies.
B00000272N|3.0|Often regarded as their best album by metal fans, Alice in Chains' debut on album, \\"Facelift\\", is one that I've grappled with extensively over the years.  Taken out of context, it's a superb record, well executed, with great songwriting.  But taken in context of the band, it largely pales when compared to their other material. <br /> <br />Finding its origins in a Seattle glam band called Alice 'n' Chains fronted by vocalist Layne Staley, the band evolved into what we know as Alice in Chains shortly after Staley met guitarist/songwriter Jerry Cantrell.  The band, rounded out by bassist Michael Starr and drummer Sean Kinney, signed to Columbia and released this debut in 1990 (a full year before Nirvana or Pearl Jam would release their major label debuts).  This album is pretty much a straight metal album, although the hallmarks of Alice's sound are all present in some quality or another-- Staley's lyrics largely lack the tortured imagery that would be so prevelent on later albums, but his voice still carries with it a darkness and grief, Cantrell's guitar layers are here, albeit in somewhat more limited quantities than they would be, and the two part vocal harmonies so prevelent on later albums are also in some use.  What is missing, however, is that superb uniqueness of performance-- Cantrell's songs are pretty straight metal, they lack that uniqueness that later material had, and Kinney's drumming isn't recognizably him-- in fact one of the real strengths of the band's other records is that Sean Kinney is unmistakable. <br /> <br />Still, lack of uniqueness aside, there's a lot of great material on here, from angst-driven opener \\"We Die Young\\" to the goofy (a sound Alice would not pursue all that much in the future) closer \\"Real Thing\\".  Along the way, there's a breakthrough hit (churning \\"Man in the Box\\") and a couple signposts to what would come (black ballad \\"Sunshine\\").  Still, along the way, there's enough filler (\\"Put You Down\\", \\"I Know Somethin\\") to keep this one from being altogether overwhelming.  Nonetheless, for metal fans, this is often considered the best work Alice did, for alternative fans, it suffers from being the \\"album before 'Dirt'\\".  Newcomers should start with \\"Dirt\\", then perhaps come back to this debut.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino produced another masterpiece. Most of the people are comparing this movie with Kill Bill, they are totally different concepts. Sin City is the recreation of Frank Miller's pulpy comic books and digital techniques has been used for entire background of the movie. Black and white scenes and absurd colors make this movie very unique. Players (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen) performance are great. There are three stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) in the movie, each is very interesting. In the first story, Marv wants to find killer of his girlfriend just got from the bar. Secondly, Dwight protect his girlfriend from ex-cop and try to prevent chaos caused by him, and finally Willis try to save young lady who saved long time ago and got into jail due to her.  <br /> <br />This is another digital masterpiece and very creative story. It is possible to see Tarantino effect on it. As a Tarantino fan, I like the \\"Sin City\\" and suggest to everybody. <br />
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Lots of other people have commented; I just wanted to add that those of you who think the ending is ambiguous should watch it again, more carefully. Much, much more carefully; the things you're spotting are subtle and appear only briefly.
B000056BOR|4.0|A good movie starring a couple of the most famous actors of the era.  Grant is a very well-off businessman who begins taking Day to famous international vacation spots, but when the time comes for the \\"romantic\\" part of the night first Day and then after they are married Grant get rashes spoiling any fun.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Just like with the album The Wall, the movie version can take some getting used to. The Wall is not like any other of Floyd's albums. DSOTM is easily enjoyed on first listen, where it has taken me months of listening to the Wall for it to sink in. The movie is the same way. The great thing about the movie is that it helps explain the album in the easiest way: with pictures.  <br /> <br />I personally don't think it is that great of a movie, but it is enjoyable to watch, especially for a Pink Floyd fan. The animation is very good and are my favorite parts of the movie. <br /> <br />I say buy this movie if you are looking for something different or are a fan of Pink Floyd.
B000002ULO|4.0|I am a child of the 80's, but I was always into the Beatles... practically wearing out my vinyl copies of the red and blue albums.  So as McCartney released records that were rather high profile in the 80's, I was interested in finding that special something that Paul brought to those Beatles records - unfortunately, I just never heard that same magic in much of his solo work.  Not to say he didn't have some great post-beatle songs, but overall, they just didn't move me.  Fast forward to 1997... In a nutshell, \\"Flaming Pie\\" is the closest that McCartney has come to creating music that stands up to his work with the Beatles.  In a rather striking comparison to his other solo records, this one isn't packed with too much filler songs, and is actually engaging and enjoyable almost the whole way through.  A couple compositions fall a bit flat, but there are some great acoustic moments on this disc that are among the best songs he has ever written.  Check out \\"Little Willow\\", \\"Calico Skies\\", \\"Somedays\\", and \\"The Song We Were Singing\\" for some of the disc's best moments.  This collection of songs becomes even more poignant when you take into consideration that it was written and recorded while his wife Linda was nearing death - it pays her a fitting tribute.  A completely worthwhile addition to any music collection.
B000063UR2|5.0|I admit when I first watched the movie Legend on TV I was addicted. I was probably one of the minority that thought Ridley Scott did damn well with this fairy tale motion picture. But when I found out that it wasnt the version that he originally intended for the US audiences I began wondering why? The performances by Tom Cruise and, in my eyes the ultimate villain actor, Tim Curry(of Rocky Horror fame)as well as newcomer Mia Sara, were tremendous. I did feel skeptical as to the score performed by Tangerine Dream. Why put a rock type score in a fairy tale or fantasy movie? I then researched who originally did the score and was stunned to find out that it was Jerry Goldsmith who was the original composer. Unfortunately at that time the only release that was the US theatrical version. I was ticked off! But now I found that Ridley Scott released the Legend Ultimate Edition DVD. I only had one word, SWEET! Two versions of the movie, the original Jerry Goldsmith extended movie, and the US Tangerine Dream Theatrical version. Now we, the viewers can view the movie the way director Ridley Scott intended it to be. This truly is a cult classic to be treasured. I just feel it is a shame that Legend wasnt recieved as well as it should have. But I'll let you folks decide.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|When I stumbled across an upcoming DVD entitled \\"North & South\\" on Amazon UK's website earlier this year, I had no idea what was in store...I bought the DVD sight unseen, taking a chance that the BBC would do a good job as always: man, was I surprised!  This BBC series is absolutely fantastic!!  I have always been a huge fan of 1995's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", as well as other BBC (and other companies') period movies: \\"North & South\\" has endeared itself to my heart, and is quickly becoming my favorite period film in at least a decade!   <br /> <br />Margaret Hale's world is turned upside-down when her minister father gives up his Southern \\"Helstone\\" parish and moves her and her mother to the Northern industrial town, \\"Milton.\\"  Her first encounter with mill owner Mr. Thornton leaves much to be desired and leaves her feeling that \\"the North\\" is an untenable place to live.  After spending time getting to know the plight of the various poor mill workers and taking care of her beloved and now-ailing mother, Margaret begins to warm to her new town: but can a \\"Southern\\" gal as she ever truly feel at home in such an alien \\"Northern\\" place?  And will she ever be able to get past her initial dislike of Mr. Thornton?  <br /> <br />This is a fantastic, beautifully-filmed and well-done series (aired on BBC USA in July)!  The cinematography is so excellent and compelling, and the scenes wonderfully acted: Daniela Denby Ashe as Margaret Hale and Richard Armitage as Mr. Thornton are completely wonderful.  If you have seen this series, let me just say the train scene is one of my favorites of all time!  The content is kept to mild violence (of angry mill workers) and little else: clean and family-friendly, this great TV series will endear itself to your heart as much as mine, just give it a chance... <br /> <br />If you can find the time, read the book by Elizabeth Gaskell: I just finished it, and let me tell you, it is absolutely amazing!  BBC did a good job of adapting it (although some storyline and characters have been altered for the sake of time).   <br /> <br />Again, this is a wonderful series and well worth the time, effort and money you will spend!
B000066NW0|5.0|Most punk is trash, especially that stupid crap nirvana and other stuff.. [...] This album is great, every song appealing and outstanding.  I can't believe how rude people are to diss something when they have nothing to back it up.  Pathetic kid, get a life.. this is REAL music.
B00005R5G9|5.0|A fantastic family flick about true love travelling through the ages-literally! <br />Kim Catrell(Sex and the City, Police Academy) stars in this fun-filled adventure as an egyptian princess born in the wrong time period with a knack for adventure and a nose for trouble, she sets her sights beyond her days and travels the earth for one thousand years searching for her place. <br />Andrew McCarthey(St. Elmo's Fire, Pretty in Pink) costars as a misfit artist struggling to exist in modern day capitalist world. entering and re-entering the work force, McCarthey finally lands a job as a window dresser for the once-famed, now failing Prince and Company. order is destroyed and sparks fly as he is reunited with his best creation, a mannequin, or so he thinks,until Catrell inhabits the mannequins form as her portal to a new time period.  These star crossed lovers paint the town red, and throw societal norms out the window in their pursuit of hapiness with one another. <br />an all around classic..... one question though,  <br />WHERE'S THE MOVIE'S SOUNDTRACK??? <br />probably one of the best 80's flicks every created and the soundtrack is phenomenal to boot, but was never released with such hits as: Alisha's \\"Do you dream about me?\\", and Belinda Carlisle's \\"In my Wildest Dreams\\" <br />these classics need to be restored and re-released, or furthermore, released for the first time. <br />this is a true travesty people. <br />anyway, hope you love the flick as much as I did-Movie Matrix
0596000480|5.0|This book, tome almost, is well written, with clear, concise, and well indexed!  Thanks <br /> <br />Bob
0805066691|5.0|The book has not lost any of its hard hitting truth since I first read it in the '70's. <br />It is the true story from beginning to end of how the whiteman took this country by force from the Redman.  The Indians loved this country, the whiteman only saw greed and money.  <br />Read the book and figure out for yourself how much better off this country would be if the Redman still owned most of it!!! <br />My 11 year old son just read the book.  His questions to me were why?  Why did the whiteman kill the peace loving indians?  Why do we have to live in bad air, bad food and with bad attidudes?  THINK ABOUT IT!!!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Tired of getting up at 2 a.m. to watch Kirk pound on some alien? Too tired to appreciate Bones' witty retorts? Just buy the thing and be done. Good quality, but very irritating initial menu, you have to wait a minute or two just to pick an episode. Kind of hard to complain about though if you can afford to buy it when elsewhere in the world people are starving.
B000002I97|5.0|This was John Prine's debut album, and I think he established himself as a major influence among his generation's artists with this record.  Every cut is a winner.  Prine's insightful but rancorless anti-war commentaries seem to come from his personal observations of his time in uniform, and there is a substance to these songs that cannot be found in the music of those who wrote and sang but did not serve.  \\"Sam Stone\\" is a matter-of-fact but troubling and engaging song about a Vietnam veteran who returns home with a heroin addiction; the story is a snapshot of the period, and it works on many levels.  \\"Hello in There\\" is Prine's folksy ballad about an unremarkable elderly couple who had been swept along with the times, a factory worker and his wife, ordinary but somehow used up and sad; Prine asks that we not just pass them by.  I prefer Prine's down-to-earth recording of \\"Hello in There\\" to Joan Baez's rendition.  Prine also performs his \\"Paradise\\" in a manner that is authentic and genuine, in contrast to the late John Denver's pleasing but superficial version.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Truly a classic in creativity
0060528737|5.0|Under the earth a malignant force lies waiting, greedy for freedom from its ancient prison. As the Old Kingdom falls again into a realm of darkness and terror, the people turn in desperation to the Abhorsen, the scourge of the Dead, for deliverance. But Abhorsen Sabriel is lost, missing in Ancelstierre--possibly even dead.<br /><br />It is up to Lirael, until a few days ago merely a Second Assistant Librarian of the Clayr and now Abhorsen-in-Waiting, to stop the Destroyer's resurrection. But Lirael, Mogget the cat, the Disreputable Dog and Lirael's nephew Prince Sameth are trapped in Abhorsen's House by Chlorr of the Mask, who is in league with the evil necromancer Hedge, who has tricked Sameth's old friend Nicholas Sayre into helping him dig up Orannis, the Destroyer.<br /><br />Lirael and her friends must travel across the Old Kingdom in a race against time, battling Shadow Hands and dark necromancers to reach Ancelstierre before it is too late. In the end Lirael has to go deep into Death itself, much deeper than her sister Sabriel ever went. But what hope can one young woman, new to the Abhorsen's craft, have against a terrible evil with the power to destroy life itself?<br /><br />ABHORSEN is a thrilling and totally absorbing conclusion to THE OLD KINGDOM trilogy and I hope Garth Nix will create more novels set in Abhorsen's world. Nix admits that talking animals are his favourite characters, and he certainly does these very well.<br /><br />While it isn't necessary to have read SABRIEL to be able to follow this novel, I would recommend it, and it definitely is necessary to read LIRAEL first, because ABHORSEN is actually a continuation of LIRAEL, while SABRIEL stands on its own.
0399103422|5.0|I saw the movie years ago and I just finished reading this work of art.  I must tell you, it is so much more detailed and contains more background of all the characters which of course the movie could not do.  I am so amazed and proud to have read such a remarkable book.  Definitely a must buy!!
B00005JNTX|1.0|I can't believe that this film is rated so highly.  There were three types of males in this movie:  Bad guy, bad cop, and good cop with a bad attitude.  There were four types of females in this movie:  Hooker, dike, stripper, and whore. <br /> <br />What kind of a freak could like a movie like this?  Once again, Tarrantino is overrated because of his shock techniques, and not because of any viable talent.  When I realized that there was no plot to this film, I looked for art.  No art was visible.  Basically, this film is a freakshow that freaks will enjoy...GAG!!!!
B00005JNTX|3.0|I really wanted to see this movie... not because word of mouth said it was amazing. All word of mouth I heard said it was alright. I wanted to see it because it was something new. Making film into a comic book rather than movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman where the comic book is adapted to a movie. So my mind set was positive. However, this translation from page to celluloid gets annoying. True, some shots looked amazing with the black and white and bits of red. It really is cool in the beginning; however, the viewer becomes numb to it after a half hour and then you have to watch it like it's just another movie. And as far as movies go, it's not that hot. The film noir that the movie was going for seemed less like a movie of that genre than a spoof on it. The male leads were able to pull of some of the lines, but Frank Miller can't write a female character to save his life. I understand that Rodriguez and Miller wanted to stay rigidly true to the source material, but some of the lines should not have spoken. I'm glad Rodriguez was able to but together such good actors, because a group of less talented ones would not be able to control their giggles.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke shines as Marv, but his story is less entertaining than that of Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba. Clive Owen does a great job as Dwight, but the storyline is barely amusing.<br /><br />The greatest parts of the movie are the opening scene and Bruce Willis's final scene. Everything else is lack luster.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Pumping Iron to me was a huge step for professional bodybuilding.  It motivates me to go the gym when im just not feeling up to it, like theres no point, and it just gets my morale up.
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|As for the movie, the acting isn't god-aweful, the sets are interesting in a earlier than The Cube way, the killings are pretty run-of-the-mill and the bad guys are ok (the guy with the eye is pretty over-the-top, but my guess is he was told to act that way).  You do get a glimpse as to the idea behind the cube and the powers-that-be that run it.  You also get a few clarifiers to the original Cube. <br /> <br />That written, it wasn't great and it wasn't horrible.  I didn't find myself wanting to turn it off and I'll probably watch it again.   <br /> <br />Three stars
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I have purchased well over a thousand CDs in my lifetime. I don't burn copies from other people.  I like to make my own mix CDs and rip songs to put on my MP3 player so I can listen to them when I run.  Creating a disc that installs a detection/scrambling device on your computer so it can read others discs like that later on is criminal.  So I say to the Foo Fighters - You sure didn't release this in the fans' honor, especially the true music lovers who feel responsibility to pay for our music.  I won't buy this CD.
0375703764|4.0|I found this book bother over- and underrated. I liked it an awful lot--it offered some genuine chills, and the academic approach to the main story was both refreshing and rewarding. On the other hand, there were times when I found myself wondering why I couldn't just read the story myself or watch the movie. Still, I think this approach worked very well, and all the extras gave me quite a bit of bang for my buck. I'm not one to go through a book breaking codes or spend hours on end discussing it on the internet, but I had a lot of fun reading House of Leaves.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|First up this review is a very different review i will not be describing the story here but rather more of my points of views of stephen chow and his vision... <br /> <br />Having seem Stephen Chow's previous comdey films(hong kong films) i must admitt he's surprises me more as an director with in depth vision eastern traditions and all that is good from the chinese culture than just a comdian actor...  Since Shaolin Soccer which i absolutely loved he yet again produced another delightful film...  <br /> <br />I think he and the director for hero and house of flying dagger stands out of the group of chinese Actor/director trying to break into the western market, their approach is simple and pure almost all elements of the film is eastern, the chinese music, actors, story and action(kung fu), this is an aspect i admire about these actor/director becos its what it is and not purposely packaged for the western market... these films are made to reveal how the eastern world is, its rich chinese cultures and its customs... on the contrary, jackie chan and jet lee's films are designed for the western audience(which is fine) but loses its some of its orenital qualities...  <br /> <br />Stephen chow brings out all the great things chinese, kung fu hustle is the result of his passion for the martial arts...the script is very well written unfortunately subtitles can never do justice to the original language, there are soo many gags and funny dialogues that just disappear in the subtitles... oh well what can you do.. learn chinese  <br /> <br />being a chinese this film makes me feel good after watching it, its funny and touching not to mention at some stages totally crazy but its all what stephen chow whats to deliver ENTERTAINMENT...  <br /> <br />Stephen Chow i bow to you!
B00005JNTX|4.0|Simply stated this is the best Comic to Movie adaption ever produced yet.<br /><br />Usually Hollywood tries to re-create something that is already an established and popular media and ruins it in the process by changing the things that made it popular in the first place.<br /><br />Not here.....

B000068PQ0|5.0|I think that, like some other reviewers, this album took me a while to get used to.  But after a few listenings, the songs have become some of my favorites.  The quality of the lyrics rivals Robert Hunter at his best, and the instrumentals are new and creative without being too wierd. Give it a chance, and really listen to it, and I think you will love it.<br /><br />By the way: before you die, make sure you see the Lips in concert.  It's...awesome.
B00005JKG5|5.0|I've watched this movie several times since it first debuted in the early 80's, and I always end up being pulled in - even though I know the ending now by heart!<br /><br />\\"Flashdance\\" is about a young girl (about 18 or 19) who has the dream of becoming a famous dancer one day.  Up until this point in her life she has been self-taught, but she realizes that in order to make her dreams come true, she will need to find a way of being accepted into one of the well known (more snooty) dance schools.<br /><br />Since it doesn't look like this will ever happen, she takes a job as a welder by day, and does exotic-type dancing (not stripping) at night.  But her dreams of becoming a \\"real\\" dancer are never far away.<br /><br />In comes her welding boss - an attractive, older man who finds this young, tough, beautiful girl intriguing.  They begin to date and, as a favor to her, he pulls some strings to get her an interview at the best dance school in the area.<br /><br />When she finds out that the interview was set up by him, she becomes enraged - as she is of the belief that she needs to do it all by herself.  So the question is, will she decide to go through with the interview/assessment anyway?  If she does, will she get in?<br /><br />I won't answer these questions in case you haven't seen this movie yet.<br /><br />Overall, this is a \\"teen-type\\" drama that still has the power to draw in us 30-somethings - probably because it reminds us of our youth during the 1980's.  It has a good storyline & great music.  As a result, I would recommend it to those who are into dance, those who like teen dramas, and those who'd like to remember the fabulous 80's.

I've never seen anyone put so much of themselves into their music before, and the \\"electricity\\" was palpable throughout the show.<br /><br />Most people probably know Meat Loaf from the songs \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Lights\\" (which you can hear playing at nearly every bar/club EVERY SINGLE weekend), and \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\".  However, I have to say that I've never heard a Meat Loaf song that I don't like - they all have a story to tell, and he's an awesome story teller!<br /><br />If you like rock & rock-type love ballads, than I highly recommend this CD to you.  Who knows, it may become one of your favorites too!

Mark Hollis makes you feel his sadness and anger. <br /> <br />Hapiness Is Easy- Smooth and funky and with the children's chior verses you feel like you are in the music. <br /> <br />Living In Another World- A musical tour de force where all the instruments blend perfectly (love the harmonica) and of course another stunning vocal performance by Hollis. <br /> <br />This would be the last time Talk Talk would make what could be considered a \\"rock\\" oriented album as later releases were rather mundane minimalist experimental pieces mostly void of any song structures but they sure went out with a bang on this one.  <br /> <br />This is a must have.

B000002HRE|4.0|This installment from Metallica is one of their finest. It falls short of the likes of And Justice For All, but it's a different serving all together. Reload is Metallica moving on from their previous self titled album, and really hitting their straps. Reload doesn't hit you like a brick like their first four albums, and doesn't begin to bore you with repitition like Metallica Metallica, but it shows what a fantastic band they were in the mid 90's, as they mellowed out just a tad, and began to make some cool tunes. Thank You boys for Load and Reload.
067942850X|5.0|I think the book \\"Into The Wild\\", by Jon Krakauer, is an exceptional book that I would read over and over again. The book was based on a true story in which the main character, Jon Krakauer, describes the experiences of the character Christopher McCandless. Chris gave all his money to charity, burned all the cash in his wallet, abandoned his car, and invented a new life for himself in the Alaskan wild. His luck wasn't too good, because he had died, but his legacy had lived on. Everyone was dying to know what had happened to him. This book goes into great depth about Alaska and how people survive in it. I give this book a very good rating.
B0000028PI|5.0|\\"THE LAST TEMPTATION\\"    REVIEW:    This album is clearly one of the best albums of Alice Cooper's career. \\"The Last Temptation\\" can easily be put in the same sentence as such albums as \\"Love It To Death,\\" \\"Killer,\\" \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" and \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\". And speaking of \\"Welcome To My Nightmare,\\" 'Temptation' marks the return of the character 'Steven' in this concept album that is designed to be a morality tale. This time around Steven is tempted by the Devil and must search within to discover what is most important in life. Brilliantly written with the classic Cooper touches of dark wit, life and death situations and the search of oneself. Musically, the album has a classy, timeless rock and roll feel to it. I must say that all ten tracks are perfectly executed with my personal faves being \\"Nothing's Free,\\" \\"Bad Place Alone,\\" and \\"Cleansed By Fire\\".    MUSICIANS:    Stef Burns ... Guitar, Vocals   Greg Smith ... Bass, Vocals   Derek Sherinian ... Keyboards, Vocals   David Uosikkinen ... Drums    Chris Cornell ... Vocals on \\"Stolen Prayer\\" and \\"Unholy War\\"   Dan Wexler ... Guitar on \\"Lost In America\\"   John Purdell ... Additional Keyboards on \\"You're My Temptation,\\" \\"Lullaby,\\" \\"It's Me\\".     PRODUCERS:    \\"Sideshow,\\" \\"Stolen Prayer,\\" \\"Unholy War,\\" \\"Cleansed By Fire\\" produced by Andy Wallace.    \\"Nothing's Free,\\" \\"Lost In America,\\" \\"Bad Place Alone\\" produced by Don Fleming.    \\"You're My Temptation,\\" \\"Lullaby,\\" and \\"It's Me\\" produced by Duane Baron/John Purdell.    INTERESTING FACT:    1. Released in July of 1994, \\"The Last Temptation\\" peaked at #68 on the Billboard Top 200.    2. The working title of the album was \\"Along Came A Spider\\".    3. \\"The Last Temptation\\" was also developed by Marvel Comics as a three-part comic book series. It was written by Neil Gaiman and drawn by Michael Zulli.       PACKAGING:    Excellent album cover. CD booklet, lyrics, pics and a sampler of \\"The Last Temptation\\" comics.    APPROX. RUNNING TIME:    49 min. and 33 sec.FINAL ANALYSIS:    Add \\"The Last Temptation\\" to the list of \\"Classic Alice Cooper Albums\\". ***** out of 5.

B00003CXCW|5.0|\\"Sunset Blvd\\" is one of the biggest pieces of golden era of Hollywood, the craft use by all the crew and actors is palpable and objective, a great movie for anyone who wants to learn what it is to act and do Hollywood, Gillis: \\"You're Norma Desmond, You used to be big! Norma Desmond: \\"I'm A Big , is the pictures that got small\\", Gillis: \\"Uh Huh\\"....great movie I like that line better than \\"Alright Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup\\"....but that doesn't mean I don't give credit to the last one, as one of the best quotes in movie history. I don't understand how Gloria Swanson didn't got the OSCAR for this, or even the competitor Bette Davis for \\"All About Eve\\", anyhow  In a short sum...this movie is about the supposed glamorous life of the 50's hollywood scene...a loser writer, a fallen star, and a rising girl....a great movie for anyone who is wicked!.....

0765348780|5.0|Just having finished reading book 4 of the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, I really needed a more fast pace book/series to take a break from the slower paced Jordan. A friend reccomended this book. I ordered it off of Amazon and looking at the cover, I figured it'd be a teenager blood and gore fantasy flick but fortunately I was wrong. This book goes just as deep as Jordan but does it a bit faster, quickly bringing you into Erikson's world filled w/ refreshing new characters and creatures. You can't really describe the basic motive behind the book in a couple sentences. It isn't a Good vs Evil book, because once you get to understand the different perspectives, you realize that each cause has its own reasons for doing the things that they do, both good and bad. It is extremely refreshing to read Erikson's work because it is unique. You can't just read the first 20 pgs and instantly know how the whole series will unfold.  <br />I already ordered book two of the series and I eagerly await its arrival and once you enter Erikson's world, you'll know why. <br />An excellent book.
B000005HFH|5.0|\\"The Best of Chet Baker Sings\\" was also marketed as \\"Let's Get Lost,\\" the title of one of the songs.  Someone was reported to have said of Baker, \\"He sure sings nice for a boy who can't sing,\\" and that is precisely true.  Baker is often distressingly sharp or flat, and his tremolo is hesitant and cowardly, but the effect of these songs is consistently lush and movingly intimate.  The selection of songs is masterful, and Baker is well within his milieu.  His rendition of \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is probably definitive, and always brings me to tears.  There are many better singers than Baker, in terms of hitting all the right notes, but few can touch his warmth, sincerity, and ability to arouse a weary old curmudgeon like myself.
0792165020|4.0|I have seen this movie twice before buying it and when I need a mini vacation from daily life, the colors and sights transport you to another place and time--like leaving your living room without actually leaving it.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I've probably seen it a hundred times, at least. My family and friends sometimes exchange the dialog with each other: \\"Hey, Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?\\"  \\"No, have you?\\"  Etc. But, all these years it always bugged me why Ripley went back for Newt. I mean, she was a good as dead. Ripley was just commiting suicide. Everytime I would watch it, I would shake my head at Ripley's sudden insanity. <br /> <br />The director's cut restores the scene that explains why Ripley goes back for Newt. I'm in my 30's now and I finally can fully love and understand this movie. <br /> <br />P.S. Skip the one with Winona Ryder. That one is beyond awful.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|It seems that there are many that did not like Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  I am not one of them.  I would have had a difficult time picking Raoul over the Phantom.  I was shocked to find out that he has not had a lot of formal voice training because he was just that good.  He made me \\"feel it\\".  I saw the stage show in Florida and it was not the infamous Michael Crawford.  Still, I found the play to be confusing and disappointing that the Phantom was not present more.  That's what I went to the show to see.  The movie did not let me down in this way. The gaps were filled to explain how the \\"phantom\\" came to exist in the solitary loneliness of the opera house and we saw how he became the musically talented and obssessive man.  Emmy Rossum has an extraoridinary voice and an innocent beauty, but it was the Phantom that brought the sensuality to each performance. Gerard Butler may not be an opera singer, but his voice was very passionate and I was captivated.  I rented this video and watched it 4 times in a week.  I just purchased the 2-disc special edition and look forward to watching it now. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to those that enjoy musicals, appreciate beauty and intense emotions portrayed through song.  I agree that the opening sequence of the chandelier is breath-taking in itself.  The whole cast has talent, but it was the Phantom that became my \\"Angel\\".  What woman doesn't want to be adored and desired exclusively to the point of obssession?  O.K.  Maybe not obssession, but \\"The Point of No Return\\" made my mouth go dry.
0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, is a story about two high school students who find love despite their opposing personalities and upbringings. Jamie Sullivan is the minister's daughter and is shy and conservative, while Landon Carter is a rebellious teenager who desperately tries to be \\"cool\\" and fit in. The two students meet in rehearsal for the school play, and they slowly begin to fall in love with one another. It wasn't until Jamie confesses to Landon that she has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, Leukemia, that the struggles in their relationship emerge; it is a true test of their love.  <br />The reason I chose to read A Walk to Remember is because I heard great things about the book and I enjoy reading about love and romance. I truly enjoyed reading it, but at points it was a little TOO sad for my taste. I think Sparks did an incredible job with his characterization; as a result, I could precisely envision the Bible-toting Jamie and the typical teen rebel Landon. I read this book in only two days because I could not put it down! I thought, though sad, it was extremely entertaining and hopeful for those who believe in love and companionship.

B0002S94OS|5.0|Look, if you are looking for true, vintage, all american death metal, this is the right CD to buy!!! One reviwer below me, said to listen to true metal like: Limp Bizkit and Aetryu, I thought to myself how naive can a person be,... Limp Bizkit is MTV promoted nu metal crap, and Aetryu is metal-core, hey I like Aetryu, but they have nothing to do with underground death metal!!!  <br /> <br /> I like metal-core like Aetryu and Killswitch Engage, and some nu metal like: early KoRn and some Slipknot!!! The fact is......... I'm tired of people trying to compare this to different types of music!!!  <br /> <br /> Now, Lamb of God is one of the most popular Death metal bands around probably second to Shadows Fall, but what amazes me is that they signed with a major record company, and instead of selling out.... they became better than ever; when most bands sign with major record companies they usually become sell outs, with the record companies constanly trying to change their music and make radio friendly songs and the band usually becomes tangled in greed over money!!!  <br /> <br /> Bands like Metallica sold out in the early 90's , and The Rolling Stones were k.o' ed after trying to make a disco album in the 70's, and Pantera even uprooted their hair metal roots and changed to true classic metal(Thank God) to make the record company happy, which was a good thing though!!! You see between the record companies, and MTV.... they are ruining music!!! Lamb of God has signed with Epic/Sony Records and have still kept their death metal and agresive edge in tact, and are at top of their game!!!  <br /> <br /> Lamb of God, has fast and agressive music, with meaning,.... they sing about politics, and are pro freedom and are using their freedom of speech, while making their own unique sound: influenced by bands like: Hatebreed and Slayers agressive feel, along with the Metallica/Pantera classic guitar solos sound, and the awesome sound death metal like: Shadows Fall and In Flames,yet they have their own unique style which makes them stand out from the other bands!!! Hey, I'm not sying this band is a Shadows Fall or an In Flames, but they still bright future, especially with this album!!!  <br /> <br /> The whole album is great from Start to finish, but the highlights are\\"Laid to Rest\\"- an awesome, fast and agressive song that is fun listening to, and if you play it at a party it may cause a mosh pit, featured at Ozzfest!!! Then you have \\"Hourglass\\"- Starts with some great bouncy begging with a guiitar solo, best begging out of all the songs, and is fast pace and agressive, but starts to slow down towards the end, but the gutar playing was awesome!!!\\"Ashes of The Wake\\"- features a great guitar solos from: Chris Porland and Alex Skolnick from the band \\"Testament\\"!!! You also have \\"The Faded Line\\"- which is a creative song that keeps changing, and changing, ... obviously the most diverse song, going from their fast and agressive, to slow, with lots of raw anger and shrieks!!! Then, you have \\"Omerta\\"- (which is Italian for Honor) is a little slower but agresive and catchy, also fun to listen too!!! Then you have \\"One Gun\\"- Very, agressive and gives a few blows to President Bush even though they don't say his name, but you would know what i mean if you listened to it,.... but as a song is fun to listen too with fun guitar solos, and is fast in your face song!!! \\"Break You\\"- Great songs with wield shrieks, shifts from slow to fast like \\"The Faded Line, this song could encourage a mosh pit, well I guess the whole album could!!! \\"What I've Become\\"- which begins with a guitar solos and takes off, similar to \\"Break You\\" except is faster and has more guitar action/ solos which make this song shine!!! The album then ends with \\"Remorse Is For The Dead\\"- which was fitting to end the album, ending it with a bang!!!  <br /> <br /> The only song I din't care for was \\"Blood of The Scribe\\", but besides that the entire album is non stop action, and is most definitly one of the best albums released this year,.... I recommend this highly!!! 5/5 A Gem in my CD collection!!!
0800132343|5.0|The realism of Das Boot excels in drawing the viewer into the experience, feeling the confinement, the boredom, the danger, the despair, the comraderie. Everything about this film is great: the acting, the script, the direction, the cinematography. Comparing Das Boot to ,say for example, Hunt for Red October is like comparing real life to reality TV. Certainly one of the best submarine movies ever, if not the best. Highly recommended.
0446677450|3.0|...and who am I to argue? The book does have an admirable straightforwardness and clarity that I respect, hence the 3 stars. So much has been said about this book already, so I'll just make two points: <br /> <br />The author's straight up \\"money is good and more is better,\\" overiding apparently any other consideration, seemed to me to be completely amoral. I like money as much as the next guy, but is it really the only thing that matters in life? <br /> <br />The \\"rich dad\\" here is his friends father. The \\"poor dad\\" is his actual father, who Kiyosaki humiliates and ridicules throughout this volume. To engage in pop psychology here, it's almost Oedipal how viciously the author goes after everything his father stands for. His ultimate crime - he wasn't \\"rich.\\" How Kiyosaki's tale impacted his family relationships is hard to say. But it did make him a lot of money... and that is what counts.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Its an addicting album.  I have probaly listend to it about 15 times front to back.  Alot of good songs to put on but besides that its a fairly advrage cd.  If you have the money get the new big box set because it has all the songs of this album and more but if you can't this is a prety good album to.  Would give 5th star if it had just a bit more in it.
0393317552|5.0|This is one of the most thoughtful and provocative books I have ever read. It provides new insights into the nature of mankind, and brilliantly interweaves an extremely powerful and comprehensive theory of human development with a wealth of fascinating details. A lot of the debate in these reviews is whether Diamond's theory is correct; I would suggest that a perspective this radical and comprehensive could hard be a complete explanation. But it's impossible to consider any theory of human development that ignores Diamond's powerful and brilliantly argued thesis. Plus, this book was a pure joy to read. A brilliant, thrilling work of history and anthropology.
0380002930|4.0|This is one of the most unique and interesting books I've ever read. Richard Adams chose rabbits as the characters of his animal fantasy, a different and more interesting choice than most. The creation of the rabbits' society was well-thought and brilliant, along with the legends that the rabbits told one another.<br /><br />The story is aabout a group of rabbits, who decide they must leave their warren when Fiver, a young buck rabbit among them, has a strange feeling that something bad is coming. His older brother Hazel leads a small group of rabbits out of the warren, in search of a new home. But when they do find a new palce, they discover that they have no female rabbits, and they must find a way to bring some to their new warren.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone 12-up, and I only dropped one star because it is a little drawn-out in some places, but it is still gripping enough to keep you reading it until the last page. Also, the author never really explained how Fiver came to have his strange sense of foreboding. Since this is one of the most important elements of the book, I would have liked for it to be explained. But other than that, this is a wonderful classic that everyone should read!

0790731002|2.0|Ok first off all kids don't belive this Zack reviewer on any movie.Zack you call this the second best batman?! THis byfar is not the worst but is no where near the quality of Tim burton or Chris nolan's films. Joel Schumacher tried to make this a comdey action and ended up ruinning the series. Val Kilmer also is not the 2nd best batman his the 3rd best(Keaton being first, Bale being second, clooney being worse .Zack is to young to know the quality of good movies.All these kids only care about the movie having action. Do yourself a favor and watch the first two and batman begins(Zack if you watch the first two movies you will call them bad because you don't understand the concept of movies without special effects. Anything without them two you are bad probably).P.S. Zack you are grade A retard.
B00005JNTX|4.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly even though I have never read the comic. I am a comic fan but not generally a Frank Miller fan. This was just as advertised. Dark, gritty, and very unusual. I realize that many reviewers didn't like the way that it was shot but I found it to be fresh and bold. Yeah, I don't want to see many other movies shot this way but it was perfect for this film. Check this one out.
0789723107|5.0|I recently finished reading this book and I must say it is excellent. Steve Krug has done an excellent job in explaining everything you need to know about web usability. It is very well written and is easy to read. He does a really good job in making it not only very informational, but also fun and to the point. I recommend everyone who is in web development or thinking about designing webpages to buy this book.
1572814349|4.0|I have been following the Golden Tarot online before, and when I have finally decided to get my first tarot deck, I chose Golden Tarot. After I got the real deck, I was a bit surprised to see how \\"shallow\\" the images are because there seemed to be a lack of sense of space in the images. But afterall, they are made from collages of many other paintings. All in all, I am happy with the deck because the images are really pretty and they convey very deep meanings behind. <br />About the booklet, it provides basic and adequate information and instructions for the deck, but half of it was in fact references to all the painting images the author has used. If you would like a more in-depth tarot book for beginning learning tarot, you'd probably need to get another book instead of relying on the booklet in the package. <br />
B00005RDRO|3.0|It was weird, curious, mysterious and whacky, but it was not drop-dead funny.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This album is good for people who like Nirvana, but arent die hard fans. I'm wore out on these songs, though. By the way, the guy that says Pearl Jam was better then Nirvana is a toolbag. How many people, besides buttplug fanboys, ever breath the name Pearl Jam anymore? Eddie Vedder couldnt carry Cobains jockstrap. Thats the fact asshead. Go listen to your stabbing Westward albums, you fruit.
B000819PKC|3.0|Dynamite is funky and a great CD to drive to, and like the rest of Jamiroquai's stuff, perfect for listening to on your headphones while walking/taking the metro/riding a bus though the urban jungle. But if you're expecting an acid-jazz digiridoo masterpiece like Return of the Space Cowboy....then stick to Return of the Space Cowboy, because this isn't it. In fact this album is the most commercialized of their entire repetoire, and while it's better than most of the music Clear Channel pumps out over the airwaves, it's subpar for Jay Kay and Co.     Weather or not you will love or just like this album depends upon at what point you jumped onto the Jamiroqui Bandwagon.  \\"Post-Traveling Without Moving\\" fans will love this, \\"Pre-Travling...\\" fans will listen to this and long for more soul, better lyrics, and a more jazzy feel, and know that Jamiroqaui can do much better.    *****  ok, I've now owned this album for about a month, and like Beck's \\"Guero\\", it has gown on me....So if I had to rerate this I'd give it a 4 instead of the original 3. This album is a thousand times better then their previous effort, Funk Odessey.
B0000648WZ|4.0|I ignored this movie when it was released in 1997, because of the negative reviews it engendered.  Since then, I saw portions of it on censorious cable stations, which of course offered a butchered version of the film.    This film is worth seeing in its totality simply for the ideology that it examines.  Since 9-11 and the advent of the \\"War on Terror\\", this film seems almost prescient. It is a satire, and it may not be as pointed or as funny a satire as \\"Team America: World Police\\"--which clearly may have been influenced by it-- but it is a more thoughtful film, and worthy of discussion by collegiate film classes.    The CGI effects do nothing for me, and the human actors could have been used to make more salient points.  Still, I have to congratulate any artist who would stick his or her neck out to explore the disturbing things in the current 'American Psyche.'    The sudden dominance of Neo-Conservatism, the anthrax scare, the vilification of John Walker (the 'American Taliban')and the Dixie Chicks, and the continually inane blather of the American Press... with these kind of indicators,  WE NEED artists and writers to speak up, and speak loudly.    Watch this film at least once... and listen to the director's comments thoroughly.

0345350499|5.0|When I read this book, I had never yet read any Arthurian Legends. So it was my introduction to the genre. Who knows if I would have have been obsessed with Arthurian Legends all throughout highschool and middle school if I hadn't read this book? If this book was the fuel for my interest then it was potent. I went on to read everything from the standard versions to the whimsical to the sensational. I even had the Arthurian dictionary. This book not only introduced me to Arthururianism, but it also has great information about magic.  I have never yet seen a better description of scrying and how to scry-even in all the countless wiccan books that have come up. Also it explains that when you cast a spell on someone-you are forever entwined with their karma to some degree. (i.e. connectivity). If you haven't read this book yet you must immediately start! You will love it!
0380977788|5.0|Wow! If you have pre-teens who are unafraid of a challenging and truly spooky story, put this book in their hands! Beautifully written and suspenseful, don't be fooled into thinking this is only a book for kids! Be sure to leave the lights on when reading this one! Makes an excellent alternative to tooth-rotting diabetes-inducing candies for Halloween.
0156029065|2.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Also it's my first Uberto Eco book. I had high hopes of Eco as I had heard that he's a linguistics professor. There is always a possibility that it was the translator who made this book read with the fluency of a Dick and Jane novel. Either way, now I would have a really hard time reading another Eco book. The other reviewers make me feel that perhaps I might appreciate his other books. It would be hard to open another Eco book though. I admit I kind of feel a grudge against him for writing this book. I can actually forgive the tedious personality of Baudolino, it's the lowest common denominator writing style that really made this an unfortunate reading experience for me.
0380789019|4.0|You may well find the story takes a while to get properly wound, but the ending most certainly makes up for that. If you like Gaiman, you'll appreciate this work. BTW, if you haven't already read 'Coraline', make that your next stop in the Gaiman collection; it's a story primarily for pre-teens, but a fine and erie novella for all ages. Both are highly recommended.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|When i first heard they were making a new Batman movie, i thought, it won't be better than the old ones. That was before i went and watched the old ones again, as I hadn't seen them in years.  The first one in 89 was good, but after that, they all completely blowed.  I mean, they just sucked.  The acting was horrible, it was so stupid, it seemed like a comedy.   <br /> <br />Then I saw the trailer for Batman Begins, and it was amazing.  I have seen the movie 3 times so far, not to mention once in IMAX, and am going to see it again.  It was just awesome.  At first, i didn't like the different look of batman or the batmobile, but you grow to like it, and now i absolutely love it.  The acting was great, and Liam Neeson was a great actor for Ra's.  I liked the new,tougher, almost criminal, Bale as Batman.  He was a great actor as well. <br /> <br />As the other review mentioned, the music for a movie can destroy it, or make it incredible.  The old batman movies had freakin circus music and Prince, what the heck.  Hans Zimmer is amazing with this movie.  Already creating incredible soundtracks for Gladiator and King Arthur, for example, he was perfect for Batman.  The music makes the exciting action scenes 20 times better.  I honestly got chills when i watched this movie, it was so good.  For example, the final scene of the train, the music made the scene so much more action packed.  And the \\"scary\\" parts, or more disturbing parts with the toxin being inhaled by batman and other people, made THOSE scenes perfect as well. <br /> <br />The new batmobile is simply amazing.  When i first saw it, before i saw the movie, i was like \\"o no, not a dang tank!\\"  But i later loved it, more than the old crappy ones with the flimsy \\"wings\\" on it.  It is just more tough and has better gadgets, like the spike strips, or more spike balls, for that matter.   <br /> <br />Batman's outfit is much better in these movies.  It doesn't look like crappy rubber or stuff like that, cuz its not.  And the guy who said earlier that he can barely move his head, well, he moves it plenty.  Compared to the old movies, he looks like he isn't even wearing the cowl. In the old ones, there wasn't any head movement at all, he had to move his whole body.  Then there is his cape.  This is the best cape ever made. Batman doesn't have to hold sticks out to make it look like his cape is up.  He can actually glide on it.  Its just so much better.   <br /> <br />Anyways, that finishes my review. This movie was the best movie i've seen in a long time.  It makes me happy to know that it wasn't really associated with the old ones, and it isn't part of that franchise.  I wouldn't want to be known for those pitiful attempts.  I can't wait till the deluxe edition comes out.  I also can't wait till the next movie comes out, with the Joker and all.
B00006ADD5|5.0|This film tells the story of which too many modern minds remain totally and dangerously IGNORANT.  Lawrence of Arabia relives the birth of modern day western intervention into the affairs of the Middle East.  If one wishes to truly understand the \\"Hatfields & McCoys\\" relationship which has developed between the Muslim world and the western nations, then THIS, at the very LEAST, is how far back one MUST go.        <br /> <br />It is unsurpassed as an action film and a dramatic film, but also an educational film of incomparable value.  It is history and essential viewing.  The story that it tells CONTINUES to affect each and every one of us alive today.             <br /> <br />No lauditory words can do this film justice -- only viewing it with an open mind and clear understanding can do it any justice at all. Even if it were produced today, it would be regarded as a marvel of cinemategraphical accomplishment from every possible aspect.  Today's films cannot touch it.  It is a masterpiece.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|The other day, I heard the riff from \\"TV Eye\\" in a car ad. Times have indeed changed. Doesn't take more than 30 seconds to ruin a good song, does it? Atleast it was just the riff. I guess they needed the money.<br /><br />So is this brilliant piece of madness finally getting mainstream attention? I suppose Jack White's endorsement in the liner notes doesn't hurt matters. In any case, it's about time this was given the reissue treatment. As always, Rhino has done a top notch job here. Sonically, it blows the low budget Electra releases away. And they kept the mix, which is more than you can say for Raw Power.<br /><br />\\"Down In The Street\\" opens a vein of pure anarchy right from the start. And that's only the beginning. If Rock & Roll is all about sex & violence, then \\"Loose\\" is the poster child. The sound of repressed lust finally set free to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting world. A war cry for the sexual revolution, or just a tune about some crazy guy flashing chicks on the street? Either way, it's one of the best tracks on this album.<br /><br />As for \\"TV Eye\\", guess it's about dropping acid & being stared at by your cat, but who really cares when you're hit with what Ron Ashton's delivering. Proof you don't need formal training to be a guitar god. Or hell, even know what you're doing. Things may mellow out a bit with the gorgeously sleazy dirge, \\"Dirt\\" but then \\"1970\\" kicks in. If there ever was a song about being \\"outta my mind on a Satuday night\\", this is it. Rumspringa from hell. Enough scorn & dersion to almost be a satire on Teenage Wasteland. Or drunken suburban brats everywhere. As for the title track, they emptied out the asylum here. A psycho jazz freak out, thanks to Steven McKay's manic sax.<br /><br />Serious collectors & audiophiles can amuse themselves with the bonus disc of alterternate takes & there's even an unreleased gem in, \\"Lost In The Future\\".<br /><br />Critics will tell you this is one of the most influential records of all time. Without a doubt, there would be no Ramones. No Clash. No Sex Pistols. No Nirvana. Not to mention hacks like Red Hot Chili Peppers. But leave all that for journalists to pontificate on. Virtually ignored at it's release, bargain binned through the years---I guess that's the price you pay for being ahead of your time. The reissue of their debut is just as essential. Simply one of the most explosive & unforgettable records you'll ever hear.No Clash. No Sex Pistols. No Nirvana. Not to mention hacks like Red Hot Chili Peppers.

B000001E3V|4.0|Eric Clapton was hurting bad during the year 1970. It had only been a month since Jimi Hendrix's death, Duane Allman had died also in that freak road accident...Eric was still reeling from the shock and wanted nothing more than to lock himself away in his mansion.  Also he was insatiably in love with a woman who was somebody elses wife. You can tell during this concert that he'd ingested alot of substances including vast amounts of booze.He must've been shaking like a leaf. His voice is shot completely...barely audible at some points but this adds to the authenticity & atmosphere of the occasion. The songs are all wonderfully done. Eric plays it safe, he doesn't take any chances. Quite frankly i don't think he even remembers this concert because he is so juiced up.   But inspite of all this  Erics Fender Strat tone is incomparible to the thin one he has today and even though he misses alot of notes onstage his sound/style is on par with his idols Otis Rush & Buddy Guy. (especially on the version contained of \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman?\\") You almost feel compelled to reach out and embrace him. No designer suits and silk shirts here. This is Eric Clapton at his most sincere.       Clapton had the unenviable task of providing both rhythm & lead guitar during this session. Considering his frail health this must've been hell for him. They might've eased his load if they'd added a rhythm guitar to give Eric more space to breathe but nonetheless Eric struggles through admirably inspite of Bobby Whitlocks wrong key meanderings on the piano on certain songs.   But this album is musically historic & authentic in detail.You can even hear the hum of the Marshall amps. This was the way it was in 1970. Back then there was just so much talent and everyone had their own individual story to tell. Clapton told his very well..just listen to the pain in his voice. The music was richly intense whether it was folk, jazz, rock or blues, to match the world political scene. Today the music scene is tame in comparison and the talent is computerised & false.
B000002KAT|5.0|First time i listened to this, I though i had waste a complete hour... <BR>Second time, I though to myself: Yeah it's better this time.. Why not give it another chance??<BR>The 3 Time, Wow.. <br />It was wonderful... <br />I realized that the wonderful Song ''Madame George'' was not long enough even if it's over 8 minutes. <br />I was trying to feel The songs. <br />I knew Van Morrison one month ago and listened to the album moondance first.. It was also really good but now i realize that Astral Weeks is much Better. All songs on the album are at least 5 stars except for beside you witch i give a 4 star.<br />Everyone needs it. It's a kind of bible witch chords!
0425156842|5.0|I thought this book was awesome - though I do think that it would have been a bit \\"over my head\\" at age 14. As an adult though, I feel like it really brought a lot of interesting concepts together in a way that was very fun and interesting to read. The breaks between lessons and character story-line were perfect for breaking up the concepts into small, easy, parts.  <br /> <br />My wife and I took turns reading this book aloud on long car rides. If we came to a part that we felt like discussing, we would stop and talk about it. We had tons of wonderful conversations about the different ways that people have thought about life, animals, culture, psychology, creation, astronomy, etc. throughout history.  <br /> <br />I thought that the first half of the book was not as interesting as the second half. I think that it is probably very easy to get a few chapters into this book and never end up finishing it. Honestly, though, if you keep going, everything comes together in a wonderful and fascinating story overall.  <br /> <br />I noticed a couple of \\"I had to read this for school and hated it\\" reviews of this book - Throughout school, I always hated whichever book was assigned too. I think that I just hated being forced to read something that I had no choice in. This is a wonderful book though. I think that anyone who is mature, approaches it with a good attitude, and is thougtful about the world around them will really enjoy it.
0440111498|5.0|This is the only K.V. book I've read, but I've read it three times in the past five years. I'm scrounging around at Amazon now looking for other books from the man. <br /> <br />Cat's Cradle is not funny, not to me. It's scary and repulsive, it's deep and it's incredibly poetic. Good poetry is only as long as it needs to be; it crams as much sense and meaning into as few words as possible; it's ambiguous/open to interpretation, and it's timeless. This book does all that stuff. I hope all of K.V.'s books are as good. <br /> <br />The plot is actually quite simple, and also irrelevant. I think V. could have said what he wanted to say 100 different ways and all of them would have had the same effect.  <br /> <br />In the hands of a lesser writer, it could have become a top mystery/thriller, perfect, really perfect, material for a bestseller, to be made into a Summer Action Blockbuster. But the man chose substance over sales, social commentary over salary, which I supose is his MO, and we all profit therefrom. <br /> <br />With the U.S. in dire need of a smack in the public face from a big mirror, Cat's Cradle is as relevant today as it was yesterday.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book!  I, like many others, stayed up late to finish it!  I read this one and \\"Shopaholic takes Manhattan\\" in less than a week!  I am reading \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\" now and love it, too.  They are all great.  I am addicted to these books.  I hope that Kinsella continues this series.  Excellent!!
B000021XS0|5.0|I just have to, first right off the bat, say that Dream Theater is my ABSOLUTE favorite band of all time, and this is my favorite album by them, making it the best album ever written. Seriously, I could go on all day about how much I love this album. Okay, enough of this fan boy bull', on to the album. You see, Scenes From A Memory is a concept album (an album whose songs tell a story) about Nicholas and Queen Victoria. It begins with Nicholas at a hypnotist ahnd telling him that once he counts backwards from ten, hr'll be completely relaxed. Next, in \\"Overture 1928\\", it's an instrumental that has parts from \\"Metropolis Part 1\\" and other songs from the album. Up next is \\"Strange Deja Vu\\". Now, Nicholas is in a dream, and he seems to not know where is even is right now, hence the title \\"SDV\\". The lyric \\"There's a girl in the mirror/Her face is getting clearer\\" is refering to Victoria. \\"Tonight I've been searching for it/a feeling that's deep inside me\\" is now Victoria speaking, and won't go back to Nicholas until the lyric \\"Back on my feet again/eyes open to real world\\", and then, he'll be heading the words. Next is \\"Through My Words\\". It's just LaBrie singing, with Jordan playing a piano effect on his keyboard. It' a lead-off track into the next track called...\\"Fatal Tragedy\\"! I think the title is self-explainatory, as it's about Victoria being murdered. Next is \\"Beyond This Life\\". At the beginning of this song, James is singing the newspaper headline in 1928, when it was revealed that Victoria was murdered. It simply meant to be viewed from an objective standpoint, w/o any emotion, like a man reading the headline on a newspaper, which is what this track basically is, besides of course the chorus. Up next is \\"Through Her Eyes\\". Now, Nicholas is at Victoria's grave stone. Nicholas is in the cemetary that he was in in his dream, and it's all becoming clearer, that he knows where he is, and what he's doing. Next is \\"Home\\". In one point in this song, the lyrics switch from Julian's pint of view, to Edward's, to Nicholas'. J: \\"Shine-lake of fire/lines make me higher/my mind drips desire/confined and overtried.\\" E: \\"I remember the first time she came to me/poured her soul out all night and cried.\\" N: \\"Her story/it holds the key/unlocking dreams from my memory.\\" Next is \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" another instrumental. Not much to say about this track, except that the 7-string guitar provides its role in this song. Next is \\"One Last Time\\". This part of the story has Nicholas swerving off somewhere, and not knowing what's going on. Up until now, Nicholas thought Victoria was murdered, and thatb was pretty much the end of it. Now he realizes Victoria had an affair with Edward, and is now breaking it off with him... I guess you can say this song has two sides to it: one, where Nicholas uncovers more, and two, where Victoria ends her relationship with Julian's brother, Edward, to go back to Julian, hence the title \\"One Last Time\\". Now we're on \\"The Sprit Carries On\\" (don't worry, we're almost done). Here, Nicholas is saying the meaning of it all, the truth, and so on and so forth. After a segment, Nicholas has finally dealt with it, and his spirit will carry on long after his death, hence the song title. And now, the dramatic conclusion, in \\"Finally Free\\". Nicholas is back from his dream in the hypnotist's office. Afterwards, Nicholas drives home (pun) and his mind starts playing back the story. Edward sees Julian and Victoria kissing in the park, and then he kills them both, which explains how Victoria died. Before, we've been told Julian killed Victoria then himself, as Edward told police. The lyrics in the later part of the song explain howEdward killed them, with metaphors. Later, Nicholas is still in the hypnotist, and the hynotist says \\"Open your eyes Nicholas!\\", and then he kills him... <br /> <br />FINALLY! After I told you the story of this album. I'll not get into the actual album itself... <br /> <br />James LaBrie proves he is anamazing vocalist, particulary on this album. He also shows emotion in his voice, making you think he was the one as Nicholas or what other character he was portraying. <br /> <br />John Petrucci...wow. What hs been said about this guy that hasn't already been said? He's an amazing guitarist, plain and simple. <br /> <br />John Myung probably does some of his best work here. Since DT doesn't have a second guitarist, they count a lot of Myung to keep the rhythm while Petrucci solos. <br /> <br />Mike Portnoy continues to leave me in shock and awe. There are times when hsi drumming can be slow an dpeaceful, others fast and frantic. A brilliant drummer. <br /> <br />Jordan Rudess makes his debut with the band here, and what a way to introduce him. He doesn't just use the same old tired organs, strings and piano. He's the most inventive keyboardist ever, and this album really shows it. <br /> <br />Even though I simnply told the story of each song, here's what I think of them... <br /> <br />1. Regression - The intro with the hypnotist talking to Nicholas. James' vocals are good, and Petrucci has a peaceful guitar riff. 5/5   <br /> <br />2. Overture 1928 - An exllent intrumental! 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Strange Deja Vu - Good, catchy song, remind me of early Fates Warning. 5/5   <br /> <br />4. Through My Words - A great peaceful ballad! 5/5  <br /> <br />5. Fatal Tragedy - Really good song, LaBrie has some errie vocals. 5/5  <br /> <br />6. Beyond This Life - EXELLENT song! Nice double bass towards the beginning. 5/5   <br /> <br />7. Through Her Eyes - The bes ballad on the album! 5/5  <br /> <br />8. Home - THE best song on the album, not to mention HEAVY, HEAVY, HEAVY. 5/5  <br /> <br />9. The Dance Of Eternity - The better of the teo instrumentals. 5/5   <br /> <br />10. One Last Time - 5/5  <br /> <br />11. The Spirit Carries On - 5/5     <br /> <br />12. Finally Free - 5/5 Great drum solo at the end. It has static at the end which is continued by 2002's 6FOIT, withthe almight...The Glass Prison (the best DT song ever)!  <br /> <br />See EVERY song egts a 5/5! <br /> <br />If there was any TRUE justice in the world, here's what would happen... <br />-This album would have sold 7 million copies. <br />-It would be nomiated for \\"Album Of The Year\\" and won. <br />-\\"Home\\" would be nomiated and won the tile of \\"Best Metal Performance\\". <br />-\\"Finally Free\\" would be nomated and won the title for \\"Best Hard Rock Song\\" <br /> <br />I din't normally write reviews this long but this album is just sooooo good and long, I guess it deserves a long, well-thought out review. Botttom line: Just buy it, goddammit!

0670033375|4.0|If you liked \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" then you will probably like this book too.  It is a lot easier to put down, but I had to finish it like a dose of medicine that tasted bad so it must be good for me.  Actually, that sounds a little harsh and I really do recommend it.  It seems less inspired that \\"Guns\\" and a like a bit of exploitation of that former great success. Maybe I am a little depressed because this is the third book I have read recently that presents a rather bleak view of the future. It is definitely a worthwhile read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The network that cancelled this after 13 episodes has rocks in its collective head and an incompetent marketing department. Sci fi junkie that I am, I never heard of it while it was on. This series is so beautifully thought out. Top notch writing, really good acting, the artistic concept is visual and verbal. It's like the \\"Wild, Wild West\\" in that they use six-shooters and ride horses, when they aren't on a spaceship. They curse in actual Chinese. There is going to be a movie coming out this fall (2005) titled \\"Serenity\\" (the name of the spaceship). I'm hoping SciFi Channel will pick up the series and make new ones. And Malcolm (the hero) has a great tush. See for yourself.
B00005N53P|2.0|I'd heard a few Strokes songs on the radio, including Last Nite, and had filed them away mentally as a band to check out at some point, probably when i could pick up some of their stuff discounted or second-hand. Finally, a few days ago, i got around to buying Is This It at my local discount music store. I haven't been so disappointed since listening to Interpol's Antics. Both bands have been hyped out of all proportion to their talent.<br />One of the other reasons I was interested in checking out The Strokes is that i've seen them compared to the Velvet Underground, a band i love dearly. Frankly, i don't think the comparsion is valid. At times, the vocalist does sound superficially like Lou Reed, and occasionally there's a bit of guitar work that recalls Sterling Morrison, but these moments are fleeting, and the similarity doesn't go all that deep. Comparisons i've read here with other NY bands such as Sonic Youth, Television and The Ramones are even less justified.<br /><br />Perhaps their next record is better - i haven't heard most of it - but Is This It is one to bypass. There's a sameness to most of the songs and it just gets boring after a while. Admittedly Last Nite is a catchy single, but its way better than anything else on the album. I really tried to give this a fair go - i listened to it several times, but just don't see what the fuss is about. i suspect their success so far is based largely on record company support (ie they've been nominated as the 'next big thing'). Don't believe the hype...

The plot is very simple, the character development is mediocre, and the writing is okay. In short, I simply do not see why this book has become as popular as it has.  <br /> <br />Was it interesting? Sure, it was okay, but in my humble opinion it simply does not stand up to classics like Uncle Tom's Cabin, Tom Sawyer, The Lord of the Rings, etc.  <br /> <br />I do think, however, that everybody should read it. It's not that it is that amazing of a book, it is that it is once of the icons of American literature.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just bought the boxed set without having seen any episodes, and I was totally blown away. <br /> <br />This is simly the best science fiction TV show that I have ever seen. Space Opera doesn't just get any better than this. <br /> <br />The characters are great in both the writing and acting. The stories, sets, and the entire premise is amazingly well done. <br /> <br />I was actually sad and somewhat pissed off after the last episode.  <br /> <br />39 days until the movie debuts...
B00092ZL80|5.0|Rather than reiterate what everyone else has said by going through the entire concert, let me quickly say that these are two great bands that show they are true musicians. The best part of course is when both bands are playing together doing each other's songs. The horn sections were great of course (I played trombone) and have been following Chicago since I got Chicago II as my first or second album when I was a kid. I remember being a deejay in college and following a guy that was playing EWF so that was my first time I got into them. <br /> <br />I want to clarify what some people having been saying about the Make Me Smile medley. What they play in concert, of which Colour My World is part of the medley, is exactly what was on one side of a record in the Chicago II double album. I saw Chicago a couple times in concert but when they finally included this whole side of the record, I was elated since that was my favorite side out of Chicago II. The songs flow together brilliantly even though some people may not know some of the lesser known songs within the \\"medley.\\"
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I regard this as a ground-breaking release. It tops The National's previous work with the complexity and variety of the tracks and the professionalism of performances by all concerned. While remaining in tune with the kind of angst we expect from rock, it offers a kind of whimsical element unusual in the genre, while still allowing us to have an emotional wallow. It also throws down a challenge by expecting a sharper level of attention from listeners - the kind of intelligent focus you'd expect more from those who follow classical music. The National deserves as much.
B00005JNZ4|5.0|If a movie makes me cry...then it's a great movie!  You can put yourself in their shoes and the movie can really happen in life, not just a make believe movie.  The actors were wonderful and John Cusack is as charming as ever!
0385335482|4.0|This novel, in a funny and light-hearted way, teaches the basic economic principle of cutting back on consumption or increasing income as a way of getting out of debt and maybe acquiring wealth. I bet the economists will disagree to a large extent but it is still sound advice. Sophie Kinsella is an author to watch in the chick-lit genre.
B0002OERI0|1.0|uh, yeah this album kinda sucks. big time. Green Day think they're doing something so huge by writing this \\"rock opera\\". but what they don't realize is that nothing they do can top Dookie.  They are oblivious to this obvious fact, so decide to start wearing studs and eyeliner to appeal to the youth of today. very sad, I must say. But the main point is, the songs on this album are pretty dern terrible. Green Day have failed, as we all knew they would eventually. If you want a good rock opera check out the Who's \\"Tommy\\". Throw American Idiot away and purchase Dookie, or even that new Gwen Stefani cd, even that blows American Idiot away. <br />
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is indeed a force to reckon with in this literary genre...short story or whatever it is. He knows how to hold you in the story as he twists and turns and punishes you with a gut wrenching laugh that is painful and sweet all at once. I guess it is that rare talent that comes with left-handed people and the queer types.
B00009L1OB|4.0|I'm a Duran Duran fan from way, way back. Like many of the reviewers here, I always felt that one of the band's strong suits had to be Simon Le Bon's lyrics. Nowhere is his gift more evident, to me, than on \\"Seventh Stranger.\\" Here's just one example from that song: \\"A year of Sundays seems to have drifted right by, I could have sworn, in one evening.\\"  <br />  I do think the album deserves a repeat listen lo, these many years later. I always felt that DD got a bum rap, simply because they came in on the same wave that brought in other, very lightweight, synthpop bands. But listen to their lyrics, folks. Here, they are second to none in the genre. George Michael probably still broods that he couldn't come up with comparable lyrics while in Wham!  <br />  I wish the band had decided to include \\"Secret Oktober\\" (\\"Union of the Snake\\" B side) in this album--it would have been a strong addition. The song is just over 2 minutes in length, but is a finely crafted work--again with incredible lyrics. \\"Racing on a shining plane--tomorrow we'll be content to watch as the lightning plays along the wires and you wonder...\\" It's an exquisite image.  <br />  DD was an unusual band for many reasons, not least of which was that each member of the group was good at what he did. I think that's borne out in this album, and in \\"Astronaut.\\" Some bands have an instrumental weak link, but DD never did. But, because of some of the company they kept on the charts and in the clubs, somehow, a lot of the critics managed to overlook the talent, preferring to focus on their penchant for odd clothes and hair dye.  <br />  \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" is not a perfect album. But it is certainly in the top five of its genre. It also holds up surprisingly well this many years down the line. Even \\"The Reflex\\" really doesn't sound dated. The album deserves to be more than a musical footnote--it did define a sound. It's still worth a listen.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|listen guys. the foo fighters did not choose to have copyright protection on the album. it was the record company's fault. so don't go rating the album with 1 star or whatever just because you can't rip it or whatever. it's unfair for the band because they hate the copyright protection just as much as you do, apparently. so STOP GIVING 1 STAR REVIEWS UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE THE MUSIC. PLEASE. <br /> <br />that being said..the album is great. i'm not much of a review writer so i'm not gonna write much besides that the album is awesome and i suggest you buy it.  <br /> <br />i also suggest that amazon.com deletes all the reviews that are just saying \\"OGM COPYRIGHT PROTECTION SUCKS!!!1\\", but i don't know if they'll do that. oh well.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|A thousand years after the \\"Seven Days of Fire\\" destroyed human civilization and most of the Earths original ecosystem. Scattered human settlements survive-isolated from one to another by the \\"Sea of Corruption\\" (fukai, sea of rot/fungus in Japanese), a lethally toxic jungle of fungus swarming with giant insects-which come together only to wage war. <br /> <br />In the 1980's this movie was edited on HBO and it's only rated PG. All because back then disneys movies were for general audiences.
B0009VRHLK|3.0|Gallo is in the driver's seat, literally. This film is an exercise in patience. All of the shots through-the-windshield were a bit tedious. But Gallo does what he can to make you a passenger on his long, lonely journey.<br /><br />Sorry, no big explosions, witty one-liners, etc here. Instead, a man on a mission, a pilgrimage. Perhaps a second viewing with the realized ending in mind will effect you differently.<br /><br />By all means, not the worst movie ever. Just extremely personal.<br /><br />I still rank Buffalo '66 as my favorite Gallo film and one of my all-time favorites, period. If you haven't seen it, please do yourself a favor and give it the once over twice.<br /><br />Pass the popcorn...

B00004RKIJ|4.0|If you're looking for something more than was available on the Communards \\"Heaven\\" CD, you'll be somewhat disappointed to find the best tracks on \\"The Communards\\" also appear on \\"Heaven,\\" which came later.  Still, \\"The Communards\\" features some wonderfully upbeat music - classic synthpop in the same vein as Frankie Goes To Hollywood or Eurythmics.  Nonetheless, this CD also contains a variety of song styles that serve to showcase Jimmy Sommerville's unique voice talents.  For any true devotee of the 80s, this is one of those \\"must have\\" albums.
0790729652|5.0|It's interesting watching the first installment some 16 years after it's initial release divorced from the hype and the phenomenon it was.  I remember the anticipation and the dread it incurred from fans and non-fans alike.  The purists wanted it to go in the direction of it's comic book roots by going in a darker direction.  These acolytes loathed the 1960's TV series with a passion.  Jack Nicholson seemed the obvious choice to play the Joker.  Michael Keaton?  That light comedian as the Dark Knight?  And what of this young director, Tim Burton, who had two relatively successful films under his belt, \\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\\" and Beetlejuice\\"?  Let's just say that this is not Adam West's Batman.  What is most striking to me is the macabre tone of the film and that it got such an overwhelming reception from the general audience($250 million in 1989 dollars).  Michael Keaton gives an interesting reading as Bruce Wayne/Batman, a kind of stoicism with personal demons bubbling under the surface.  Nicholson's performance is downright inspired with him just chewing the scenery as the mirthful homocidal performance artist.  Much was made of the look of the film, which won an Oscar for art director Anton Furst (\\"Full Metal Jacket\\").  The look of Gotham City can best be described as decaying industrial gothic.  Unlike alot of films nowadays, with the exception of the \\"Spiderman\\" films, character and story come first here and that's the reason \\"Batman\\" holds up so well.  The most recent entry in the \\"Batman\\" canon, \\"Batman Begins\\", is the only one that I can think of that compares favorably to this one.
B000001EMW|5.0|This is one of the most unique albums floating around out there.  Four cello players from Scandinavia put together this debut album of Metallica songs.  The performance is strictly acoustic, although the intensity of the playing almost makes it sound like electric guitars. <br /> <br />These four cellos represent the two guitars, bass, and the melody of the vocals, respectively.  These guys also play all the guitar solos note for note.  On this debut release, there are some classics like 'Creeping Death,' 'Master of Puppets,' and 'Welcome Home (Sanitarium)'.  The rest of the tracks are mostly material from their Black Album, such as 'Enter Sandman,' 'Sad But True,' and 'The Unforgiven'.   <br /> <br />Typically, I prefer the older Metllica songs, but on this record, the later material fits the best when performed on the cello.  The older songs get monotonous, but tracks like 'The Unforgiven' sound beautiful here.  This is probably because they have a little more melody and less power chords and palm muting, as opposed to Cliff Burton-era Metallica.  These guys are masters of their instruments and the performance is extremely professional, especially in their use of vibrato.  If you're a Metallica fan, you will love this album.  I also hear their other material is great, although I do not own it.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The perfect accompaniment to the movie. An amazing, painful movie; much the same can be said about this eerie, melancholy soundtrack. <br /> <br />This is definately one CD you don't want to listen to if you're looking to be cheered up. The music captures so perfectly the mood of the movie, the disaster of addiction and love lost and lives spiraling out of control. Absolutely amazing cd.
B000002IHU|5.0|This is Ratt's very best album without a doubt. All the tracks are strong both lyrically and musically. If you buy only one cd by Ratt this is the one I reccommend most. No disappointments with this one.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Mars. Echelon. Provehito in altum. What do these words have in common? They're all words you should add to your vocabulary if you're a fan of 30 Seconds to Mars. <br /> The music rocks, and it rocks hard. There's some nice electronic touches in the music, but 30STM is good old rock. For those of you who aren't particularly fond of music with excessive screaming, or anything heavier than Tool, you're in luck. The sound is extremely melodic, and the heavier music they create is on about the same level as the softer stuff of Chevelle or Tool.  <br /> There's a handful of catchy songs on the CD;  \\"Capricorn\\", for example. Being a synthrock girl, I especially love songs with the spacey/synthy blurbs. \\"Buddha for Mary\\" and \\"93 Million Miles\\" are my favorite- the lyrics, vocals, and music is all extremely well composed and tight; on every song, not just those two, however. I can't say there's any songs on the CD I'd skip over, which is always a good sign. <br /> The band is fronted by Jared Leto (also a great actor), who also plays guitar and does synths, Shannon Leto (an incredible drummer), Tomo Milicevic (guitar) and Matt Watcher (bassist).  <br /> Their sophomore release, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", will be released August 30th.Mark that date on your calendar and go get the CD (and be sure to grab their first CD as well, if you don't already have it).
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|In television, realism is often jettisoned in favor of the unusual and surreal. The idea is that people don't want to see their OWN lives on their TV screen - they want to see moderately believable characters living out circumstances that those in the real world can only fantasize about and imagine happening to them. <br /> <br />Fortunately, we are occasionally graced with shows like the OC, which remind us that real life is just as good - nay, better! - than anything TV can offer us.  <br /> <br />This show is about several terrifically good-looking people who live near beaches that, evidently, only allow good-looking people to use them....come to think of it, everyone in this show is good-looking, with the exception of marginal characters who are either comic foils, or who eventually get proven wrong about whatever it is on which they disagree with main characters.  <br /> <br />As in real life, these good-looking folks always have something clever to say, so the dialogue is witty and taut. Sometimes, I swear it's my friends and I talking, because this is (as we know) how real people interact.  <br /> <br />True to its referent - real life -, there is always some sort of scandal or trying situation in SOMEONE'S life. I've noticed that, generally, there are two major situations transpiring at about the same time, with several smaller, sometimes comical, situations underway also. Since this closed group of people mostly sticks together, all of these situations interrelate in such a way as to gradually make the characters grow together and bond. This crazy dynamic seems to also result in MY bonding with the characters - I feel like I really know them! Perhaps it's because they're so realistic; they remind me of real people that I know in real life.  <br /> <br />One other small detail that I've noticed, that demonstrates the level of attention to detail these talented and intellectually profound thinkers have taken in developing this show, is that (just like in thereal world) nobody ever has to go to the bathroom. I never have to go, so it's nice to see that neither do these walking reflections of reality. <br /> <br />In short, this show is NOTHING like the bulk of television out there - artificial and unbelievable. No, with the OC, you will sometimes wonder just exactly WHERE the line is between truth and fiction.  <br /> <br />Thanks for reading my review! I'm off to the beach where only beautiful people go! Fortunately, my tan is PERFECT, but even if it weren't, I could always just take my exotic sports car to the mall instead, and spend the large sums of money that I earn from my job as a flashy and high-paid lawyer. That's what all of we Californians do. We make money. And live large. It's beautifully real.
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|Sometimes it's amazing what it takes to make a good album successful. I've owned, and enjoyed Colour the Small One for nearly two years. I've talked it up to friends (especially fans of the group Zero 7), but since it never got a domestic release in the US, the import price kept most people away. But now, after being featured prominently in preseason teasers and the final episode of Six Feet Under, \\"Breathe Me\\" has finally put some light on this unheralded artist. About darned time! <br /> <br />I initially became familiar with Sia Furler as one of the three highly distincttive singers on Zero 7's excellent debut record. Looking for more of the same, I purchased Healing Is Difficult, her first solo record. I was slightly disappointed. Although Healing... contained some great songs (\\"Drink to Get Drunk,\\" \\"Blow It All Away,\\" and especially, \\"I'm Not Important to You\\"), the record also contained a number of quirky, melodically weak up-tempo tunes. Colour the Small One is the better album. <br /> <br />Although informed by the blissed-out chill of Zero 7, Sia's second album has a certain sleepy appeal all its own. The lanquid music perfectly compliments the singer's soulful, semi-slurred delivery and introspective lyrics. Along with \\"Breathe Me,\\" the songs \\"Numb,\\" \\"Rewrite,\\" and \\"Sunday\\" perfectly capture the feeling of (to quote \\"Numb\\") \\"living in your head without anything to numb you.\\" Sia's occasional quirkiness remains, on songs like \\"Sweet Potato,\\" but seems more natural now. <br /> <br />The music people finding distinctive music to feature on Six Feet Under deserve credit for locating an undiscovered gem this time. It's really gratfying to see how many people have been moved by \\"Breathe Me\\" to seek out more music from Sia. And it's good to see an artist I've liked and recommended finally starting to get her due. I can't tell you how rarely that happens. But one final hurdle remains: the domestic release. Pay attention, Universal! Get this record out over here!
068485743X|5.0|I was intrigued by the title. As a writer, I am constantly searching to read books on writing, and I know that having a good title helps sell a book. This one hooked me from the first moment I saw it. The good news, is that it did not let me down when I opened the book. There is a lot of wisdom about the publishing process packed in this book, not always easy to come by in other writing books.<br /><br />Practical advice is easy to find here - like strengthening nouns and verbs so they don't need adjectives and adverbs, or leaving things blank, forcing the reader to use his imagination. What a challenging concept...forcing the reader to use his imagination!  It reminds me of a time in music class, where we learned about a famous composer who composed a modern piece - consisting of the pianist going on stage, sitting on the piano bench for a certain amount of time, then getting up and leaving. That was the composition. Speaking about using imagination!<br /><br />This is another splendid book to add to a writer's collection, and I recommend it highly.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I first heard these women perform on PBS and I was amazed by the beauty of their voices and talent. I still get goose bumps evertime I hear this CD.  My favorite songs are One World and Sing Me a Song.  They have great lyrics and are very inspiring.
B000003TBP|4.0|Beck is great. After all the years I've never got sick of him, There are times in life when you just need some crazy Beck stuff on the stereo. It comes in all forms too. This album is great, no doubt. It won him a grammy didn't it? Come on, Dust Brothers brought the same magic to the table that made BEASTIES PAULS BOUTIQUE a gem, I give them more credit for HIGH FIVE- Which is on almost every party mix I've ever made. And Beck is in full throttle here especially on HOT WAX, LORD ONLY KNOWS, and JACK-ASS. The thing is I am very bored with the rest of this album. Theres so much better stuff. MELLOW GOLD is so great, he made that album on the fly with like no production. ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, is a collection of basement tapes and after years I still can't get enough. I've had all I can stand of tracks like NEW POLLUTION and DEVILS HAIRCUT and if I hear those two turntables and a microphone again, I'm probably gonna YAAAWWWWWWWWWWN, then smash the bag out of my stereo. Beck is a genius, Dust brothers too, they did some excellent work and rightly I'll give the album credit (four stars instead of 5). If you're looking into something that'll hold up though MELLOW GOLD is the most interesting thing I've ever listened too and it's got all of MY favorites anyway. Check that one out. If you've never heard PAULS BOUTIQUE, the second album by Beastie Boys, Check that out too- You'll see all the crazy layered sounds that Dust Brothers produce on a much cooler platform for their skills.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|This is the best of Donna, simply!  It covers every note of her existance in the Divine Days of Disco -- never to be forgotten. <br />This is truly classical... Mozart, look out!
B0007M22TI|5.0|I'm a classical musician and usually detest these sorts of things but a good friend bought this and showed it to me. WOW. <br /> <br />I almost hate to admit it but I am truely blown away by this. The orchestra, choir and soloists really give a tour de force. <br /> <br />Particularly love \\"Send me a Song\\" with I think Lisa? singing. Also Marble Halls is wonderful. I could keep going here, great version of Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring, and even the ubiquitous \\"You Raise Me Up\\" is given a good airing. <br /> <br />With Christmas coming I would love a few of the classics given a fresh new treatment by this group, and in particular the arrangers. <br /> <br />Great job.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah's latest offering is certainly superior to her last few efforts, consolidated further by it's successful hit single 'We Belong Together'. However this is in no way mariah's most personal or 'emancipated' album. Sure, there is undeniably a return to form on Mariah's part, more specifically, in the vocal department. However, in many ways, this is Mariah's sellout album, in the sense that it just seems so desperate to be a hit. All the songs here are immaculately produced to radio-friendly perfection, with perfectly constructed melodies, and perfectly produced vocals (just listen to 'get your number'). <br /> <br />When it comes to to lyics, mariah seems more interested in wordplay, and hooks, than opening herself up. A good rhyme with a good beat seems to be the go here. <br /> <br />The bottom line is, no album will ever reach the hights that Buttefly reached. There is no 'Close My Eyes' or 'Outside' on this album. Those songs were emotionally charged, personal tracks which featured heart aching lyrics. Nothing this personal is to be found here, and considering this is her so called 'emancipation', this is utterly disappointing. <br /> <br />This is still a four star review though, for the simple fact that this album is good, and worthy of it's purchase, regardless of it's misleading title. <br /> <br />
0679735909|1.0|I tried to read this book.  In the end, the best part was that I was able to return it for a full refund.   <br /> <br />I have been an avid reader all of my life and I will give a book a chance; however, in this instance, I gave up before I even got to page 10.  I even tried reading ahead to see if I could find anything promising.  I read excerpts from those first few pages to others thinking that perhaps I was missing something?  If I was missing something, they couldn't find it either.     <br /> <br />Why oh why would anyone want to read this book?  It is nearly 600 pages long and several reviewers said the first half was boring.  Why would anyone spend their time reading roughly 300 pages if they thought it was boring? <br /> <br />There are so many good books out there; however, this is not one of them.  Maybe people felt that they should love this book.  Surely anyone who knows that many large words should be able to write a halfway decent novel.  It came off sounding like those sentences we used to write in school when the teacher would give us a list of words and we HAD to use them in a sentence.  The only difference is that this time those boring sentences had to be used in paragraphs - nearly 600 pages of boring sentences in even more boring paragraphs.   <br /> <br />Frankly, I would rather read the terms of my home and auto insurance policies than read this book.
0805066691|5.0|My mother first read this book when I was just 12.  I vividly remember her crying as she read.  Now, almost 30 years later, I find myself doing the same.   <br />CRIMINAL is only the beginning of how to describe the way that the Indian nations were treated by the US Government and their \\"Manifest Destiny\\" policy.  For anyone who has ever watched an old western or even has an opinion on the Native Americans, I suggest you read this book.   <br />It should be required reading for ALL High School students.   <br />I was deeply touched by the honor among these men who in changing times, still were willing to work with the US Government, even after the government and its army had shown that they were not honorable.
B000784WMW|5.0|This is the only version of Jane Eyre that I have seen that is word for word from the book text, not leaving out subplots or anything! <br />The sets are wonderful, the acting is very well done. I have only seen Zelah Clark in one other production besides this but she does an admirable job. I have seen Timothy Dalton in many roles and I have to say this was my absolute hands down favorite role of his. <br />It is so refreshing to see a screenplay not mangled by the screenwriter! The only thing that I would change about the DVD is to show it as a whole and not break it down into chapters. I have to admit it is easy to stop at the end of a chapter and pick up again another time. <br />I recommend this to all who love the book and hate the other screen versions!
B0007M22TI|4.0|I got the CD and DVD after seeing on PBS, I guess like most people. <br /> <br />Not sure which I prefer, I think the audio quality of the CD os better, but it's cool to be able to see all the Celtic Women in action. <br /> <br />I LOVE the fact they don't girate and dance around the place, I think the world has enough of that sort of thing. They just stand there and sing, how refreshing. <br /> <br />This concert looks totally live to me, though I wouldn't be surprised if they did some of it in a studio cause it looks like such a difficult sing for all of them, especially with an orchestra behind you! Anyway I don't care, I think they're brilliant, and not just the well-known music. I love all the other stuff I'm not getting to know really well. I've learned nearly all the words off by heart. <br /> <br />Love to hear them do the song from Titanic by the way.
B00009W0WM|5.0|What can be said that has not already been said.  The acting, the writing, the mood, all brilliant.  Like many movie fans, this is my favorite movie of all time and it just gets better with age.
B000A88EV4|5.0|The DVD release of this film is way overdue and I concur with the other reviewers that Thewlis is outstanding in the film, and to say the least, he deserved an Oscar award for it (given what an often vicious character Thewlis' character Johnny was, it's not surprising that the Oscars ignored this performance- after all, the Academy can't allow themselves to endorse a character who isn't Safe as Milk). His co-stars Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp also contributed strong performances.    The commentary track in this set is fascinating and thoroughly enhanced my appreciation of what I already considered a masterpiece.     I can't remember if a comment I read (or maybe heard in the commentary) about Johnny was made by Thewlis or Leigh, but it was that Johnny is a character that is just a little too clever for his own good. Take the sarcastic bitter side of John Lennon without the hope and you've got a miserable man- that's Naked's Johnny all over. Although we see Johnny do some horrible things, he is also an idealist who is enraged by how far the world (and probably he himself) falls short of his expectations.     I'm glad Criterion is giving this film the presentation it deserves.
B00009NH5W|5.0|Back in the late 80's I remember seeing Terence Trent D'Arby perform on MTV. He was and still is a great writer, performer, musician and artist.  His first album \\"Introducing the Hardline, According to Terence Trent D'Arby\\" is still one of my favorites. You remember \\"Wishing Well\\" don't you? Ahhh, to reminisce.<br /><br />After experiencing a lot of changes and hangups with the albums that followed, he relocated to Europe and recorded songs under the name of Sananda Maitreya.  This was his best move because he found himself creatively.  Being such a visionary, he crafts these songs like sculptures, making them so real in your minds that you can seemingly touch the words.  He embodies what a music artist should be.  Reminds me a lot of Prince, but with fewer albums and minus the hallucinatory fixation with himself.<br /><br />\\"Wildcard!\\" is an album that wraps you up and comforts you in its flow, continuing to snuggle you even after the final song. I found myself connected to the songs \\"Girl\\", \\"Shalom\\" and \\"Some Birds Blue\\".  Even so, if there ever was a perfect album, this is it. I find no fault with it, and I am greatly pleased with what Terence has created.<br /><br />It is definitely an album you can listen to from start to finish, crying or laughing or dancing or cuddling. Doesn't matter, because if you like good music, you'll love it.
B00005JNEI|3.0|A lot of other Amazon reviewers complain that the film is biased and doesn't show both sides of the issues.  It's true that it's biased, but so is any documentary.  \\"March of the Penguins\\" pretends that penguins are motivated by love, and that they share other character traits such as courage, determination, and faith.  That's an anthropomorphism, a controversial position in biology, and \\"March of the Penguins\\" never shows the other side.  That's OK there, and it's OK for Michael Moore not to show the other side either.<br /><br />To say something nice first: the movie is moderately funny.  Moore accomplishes his humor mostly through juxtapositions.  When he switches from one line of narrative to another, or juxtaposes images, it normally hits you fast and is usually funny.  He also likes to juxtapose music and narrative (such as \\"We gotta get out of here\\" when talking about the Saudis who fled the US after 9/11).  I didn't think those were very funny because the humor lasts only a second (the line \\"We gotta get out of here\\" in this example) but his clip from the song lasts significantly longer.  As a result, I found myself thinking, \\"enough already,\\" for most of the song humor.<br /><br />He also has some amusing but blatantly unfair sections.  For example, he shows a long line of Republicans getting makeup for the cameras.  This makes them look phony.  But, obviously Democrats also get made up for the cameras, and presumably they would look phony too.  So, it's a cheap shot.<br /><br />There are lots of cheap shots in this movie.  Moore has every right to take his cheap shots, but they are, well, cheap.<br /><br />Moore's central \\"argument\\" is that Bush is a doofus who likes to go on vacation, and whose family and friends make a lot of money from oil, connections with Saudi Arabia, and the defense industry.  OK, there are some grains of truth in that.  However, those facts do not demonstrate *causality* of anything.  Did Bush decide to attack Iraq so that his family could make a lot of money from defense spending and increases in the price of oil?  The movie doesn't even begin to *prove* that.  Moore prefers to *imply* or *insinuate* so that he can't be caught out as telling outright falsehooods.<br /><br />Moore worked much harder on his evidence in this movie, and he sources his evidence on his website.  As a result, he has moved beyond making \\"mistakes\\" (as in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\") to misusing evidence.  For example, his data on Saudi investment is either sloppy or misleading (take your pick).  Someone tells him the amount of Saudi investment in the US, and then Moore asks what that is as a ratio of GNP.  Well, that's a misleading measure.  Investment generates income, and GNP is income.  It's like asking your sister the size of her savings account (investment) and then comparing that to the *interest* that you earn on your savings account (income).  It's just the wrong comparison.  The answer to this for Saudi investment, by the way, is \\"5-7% of GNP,\\" which Moore then refers to as \\"7%,\\" which is gratuitously sloppy.  Moore needs to learn that such use of evidence does not help persuade us of his point of view.<br /><br />So, Moore isn't an economist or a lawyer.  He's a filmmaker, and here the movie often succeeds.  First, he's unearthed some great film clips.  Here are my favorites: (1) he shows us Al Gore gaveling House members out of order in the joint session of Congress when these members tried to object to Bush's electoral victory; (2) he shows us Bush in the classroom reading \\"My Pet Goat\\" while the planes hit the Twin Towers; and (3) he found film of Army officers telling business meetings how much money there is to be made in Iraq.  It's a shame that mainstream media do not show us such pictures (although the \\"Daily Show\\" does).<br /><br />The clips, like the movie, are subjected to Moore's voiceover, which I find annoying.  It sounds as if he's trying too hard (a) not to sound like an angry liberal but a reasonable man; and (b) to speak English at an eighth-grade level so that even a doofus can understand him.  It detracted from the film.<br /><br />In short, the movie is full of circumstantial evidence of various Bush misdeeds.  Where there is smoke, there is doubtless some fire, but Moore implies that there is fire everywhere.  He makes some interesting points but is too blatantly partisan and too unconcerned with proper argumentation to be effective.  Because it became an \\"event\\" film that everyone talked about, everyone should see it and make up their own mind.  As for me: if it were an undergraduate essay, he would probably earn a B.liberal but a reasonable man; and (b) to speak English at an eighth-grade level so that even a doofus can understand him.  It detracted from the film. <br /> <br />In short, the movie is full of circumstantial evidence of various Bush misdeeds.

B00082IJ08|5.0|Gorillaz grew on me.  The first album, which I just picked up this year, is really nice beyond compare, but this new album is something that sets itself apart.<br /><br />Apart from being produced by Danger Mouse with a host of guest rappers and entertainers from Roots Manuva to Dennis Hopper, this album is an experience from beginning to end exuding greatness.<br /><br />One thing that you will notice is that some of the songs tie into one another.  For instance, \\"Fire Coming Out of A Monkey's Head\\" ends with a bang and the next song \\"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\\" talks about fire coming out of a monkey's head.  After that, the next song is \\"Demon Days\\", which is sort of a segue from the previous song.  They all sort of blend together. Cool as hell, for real!<br /><br />I am in awe of these guys because they have produced two complete masterpieces without really going on tour or showing their faces, much like an earlier Steely Dan.  You will find that the lyrics are nearly incomprehensible but are so fun that you won't care.  I had to look up the words online to find out what they were saying.  \\"Kids with Guns\\" is a neat treat that you may want to look up.<br /><br />Cop this if you like N.E.R.D., MF Doom or Tricky.<br /><br />Beats: slicker than usual<br /><br />Lyrics: innocuously sound<br /><br />Lasting appeal: classic and masterful
0099267195|5.0|This is a superbly written children's book from the late 1960s and republished in the 1990s.  There is plenty of mystery and you never quite work out why Charlotte is mysteriously transposed in time back to the first world war until the last few pages.  I think it's one for slightly older children, perhaps around 10-13, as there are many elements in it around the history of the 1914-18 war which the imaginative teacher could include in class lessons.<br /><br />It's a great read and I found it difficult to put down, coming back to it fresh after last reading it in my own childhood.
0385335482|4.0|I read Shopaholic Takes Manhatten first, then this one.  Both were great.  You love Rebecca and think \\"what a dummy\\" at the same time, but the story is definitely entertaining and a great read.
0312319517|5.0|This novel was Forsyth's best yet!  It had the best ending ever!  I haven't been impressed by a book since Point of Impact by Steven Hunter.  I have bought at least 8 copies of this book for friends and family.  Excellent Read!
B000089RVX|5.0|Geez I really wish I could give the album 10 stars!!!! After hearing Bring Me To Life, I fell completely in love with their music. I bought the CD, and I fell in love with EVERY one of their songs!!!! Most of the other people's songs I've heard are like they sang to you, but Evanescence's songs feel like they are coming out of you, like you burst out your soul with every lyrics, beat, rhythm instead of absorbing them. And Amy Lee is simply amazing in all of her vocals!!! Evanescence is not depressing, it's soul baring. Most of their lyrics are just feelings described in a dark way, but not really describing a depressing incident. You want to hear depressing music, go hear Avril Lavigne's second album; it has TONs of depressing stuff in it. I heard Evanescence is finally gonna release their second album!!! Yay I can't wait!!! By the way, why does people always pick on popular artists??? It's like there's a group of people who watches for breakthrough artists and then to put them down! Geez, get a life will you guys.
0312995423|1.0|I thought Dan Brown was a truthful researcher. But after reading what he writes about Seville and Spain, I do know he has never been in Spain or maybe heard about it. He claims to have studied in Seville but I can hardly believe that, since he shows a complete ignorance and disdain on this great city and the Spanish society in so many aspects. Just for one: talks about the dangerous staircases up the Giralda tower. Well, Mr. Brown, had you been in Seville at least for a day visit, you'd know the Giralda has no staircases but ramps. This is fiction, I know, but man... Play fiction in other things, not on factual data. Just another token of ignorance and disrespect from the US (just like Tom Clancy's \\"Balance of power\\" or \\"Mission: Impossible 2\\" by John Woo).

B00005V0X5|5.0|Dave Mustaine has made some great albums.Killing Is My Business.....is Megadeth's best album even though there first four albums are five stars. <br />Megadeth is pure original. <br />Everyone knows what went on between Dave and gay Metallica,you know that was the best decision Metallica ever made was kicking Dave out of the band because then there wouldn't be Megadeth and besides Metallica SUCKS.This is a good remastered album even though I like the original cover better and I hate the bleeping of the swear words in the song These Boots. <br />Last Rites/Loved To Death is the best if not the best Megadeth song ever,all the songs rule on the album and trust me you would agree.The Skull Beneath The Skin will knock you out,Mechanix everyone knows that's Dave's song and crapy Metallica stole and used his song for the Four horsemen.Metallica kicked Dave out of the band so they shouldn't use dave's material,come up with your own fu.....material Metallica.The sound is good,all the riffs,solos and every thing on this album is pure original.
0380002930|3.0|My Middle-school is making me read this book over the summer, and since it is for school, it makes the book less interesting. Maybe if schools would suggest the book rather than forcing it, kids would find it interesting and a classic book. But rather, the schools are forcing children to read a book that at often times is confusing to some children under the 6th grade level of reading. The book has an interesting story line with many plottwists, but it seems to draw on about the same subject for too long and I often found myself fidgety while reading it. I recommend for enjoyment over a few months, but not have to rush and read it within 3.
B000002IKR|5.0|This is my favorite Testament album.Testament's original name was Legacy.Over The Wall is one of the best Testament songs ever,this song will give you goose bumps,what can I say all the songs rule.Alex Skolnick is a shredder,his solos are original,no one sounds like him.Chuck Billy rules at singing.Buy Testament's first four albums.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|The first cd of this double-disc album is classic Foo Fighters--interesting to listen to, catchy songs, although Dave Grohl's voice does make me want to hand him a lozenge after a few songs.  Nothing terrifically new about these songs, but that is not to say they aren't enjoyable.  The acoustic disc, however, is completely delightful.  Who knew \\"pretty\\" would be the first word to pop into your head when listening to the Foo?  This is a great album to get your hard-rock-lovin' boyfriend, gals--and get him turned on to something a little softer.
B000069HK2|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. I normally would get burnt out on most bands with this type of sound, but not The Used. I gotta say that these guys know how to grab the listener and pull them in. My faves on this album are Taste Of Ink, Poetic Tragedy, Blue And Yellow, and On My Own.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Love this CD. It has so much life and forceful musical strings. Some of the soft parts especially in the beginning are very difficult to hear; that would be my only critizism. Otherwise, it's fun, lively and will definately keep you awake and wanting more.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|So what's a band to do when in-figthing and turmoil threaten to destroy it?  For Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the music itself became the savior of sorts as the group abandon their neo-psychedelic fuzzery in favor of a more rustic, bluesy, and introspective musical pastiche on HOWL.  Gone are the noisy electric guitar waves, rampaging baselines, and Jesus and Mary Chain inspired walls of feedback.  In their place are convincing forays into blues, americana, folk, and yep, even gospel music, featuring chunky acoustic guitar, swampy harmonica, and even the odd addition of trombones.  There's even an unexpected piano driven ballad in the form of \\"Promise.\\"   More suprising than the musical make-over is the shocking agility and effortlessness that BRMC pull off in their performances of this material.  This stuff truly suits them.  Whether their stomping their black boots out of the delta on the album's first single \\"Ain't No Easy Way,\\" or sitting porchside on \\"Devil's Waitin'\\" or \\"Fault Line,\\" these rock n' rollers prove that their mighty comfortable without their amps cranked to eleven.  Some fans will no doubt be displeased with this sonic U-turn and many may be left asking \\"Whatever Happened To My Rock N' Roll?\\"  Maybe it just got a little older and wiser.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|I was looking forward something really strange after reading reviews.  This is a good CD.  It is very different from anything out there now.  Looking past the unusual story lyrics, the music never reaches folk, or alternative status.  There are rock, latin, jazz, blues and classical influences.  Overall I enjoy the CD, but only for background music, or the novelty of the lyrics.  Definately not a road trip CD.  Sufjan Stevens is very talented musically and I would love to see him matched up with a writer to create serious music.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold is a poet, stringing together a rhythm of words that grips and twists you. You get to see into the soul of each character and feel their emotion as they deal with loss. The plot moves quickly and is entrancing. I couldn't put it down! \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a work of art.
B00005R62K|4.0|When you look at Judas Priest's career you can almost see a parallel to the Scorpions.  Their first few albums are almost 'mystical' sounding, and then they proceed to get a little harder until by 1980 they become part of the British Invasion, along with Def Leppard and Iron Maiden (yeah the Scorps weren't British, but except for Klaus Meine's accent they might as well have been).<br /><br />So somewhere along the line, Priest had to evolve from 'Rocka Rolla',  'Sad Wings of Destiny' and 'Sin after Sin' to 'Hell bent for Leather', 'Point of entry' and 'Screaming for Vengeance'.  Ladies and Genltemen, may I present Stained Class.<br /><br />I was 14, (give or take a year) laying on my bed, listening to the local college radio station's Tuesday/Thursday dosage of Heavy Metal, when the DJ introduced me to the new Judas Priest album by playing 'Saints in Hell'.  I bought Stained Class the next day.<br /><br />Yes there are some weak songs on the album. the white heat, red hot chorus is lame, and I'm sure Priest had a B side that was better than 'Better by you better than me', but the rest of the album is awesome.<br /><br />Exciter is amazing, and the only problem with Invader, was that you had to get up when it was done and flip the album so that you could hear the crowning jewel of the album which is 'Saints in Hell' (thank God for CD's!!!!!!!!!!!) Had the DJ played any other song then Saints in Hell it probably would have taken me a week to buy the album, but I just had to hear that song again. and again, and again... 'Savage', 'Beyond the Realms of Death' and Heroes End are also great songs..<br /><br />So here you have it... the farewell to the old Priest and the welcoming of the 'British Invasion Priest' (enjoy it while you can, 'cause it went down hill after Screaming for Vengeance)..
0743455967|4.0|I had never read a book about writing books. After reading \\"On writing\\", it seems I still haven't read a book about writing. More than a lesson, it feels that Stephen King has invited you to a chat on his favorite armachair over the fireplace, the reader listening to him while taking a glass of wine.<br /><br />The book is divided in three parts. First, a short autobiography of the author; as always, SK wants the reader to feel the atmosphere, this time the atmosphere of his childhood, of his struggling first jobs and family life with wife Tabitha and how he broke through with \\"Carrie\\". Then there is a session of writing tips - more like a \\"DOs and DON'Ts\\" about the craft. In fact, Stephen King tells the reader how HE writes, and you decide if you want to take his advice or not. The last part is more like a personal release by the author, as he tells his constant readers about his near-tragic accident while walking the backroads of Maine.<br /><br />This is a light reading, never too deep, never boring. I think Stephen King's usual readers will enjoy this book more than people that are not acquainted with his work.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Once again, as I did with the first album, I'm starting out saying I am rating the music of the album, not Avril or anything she has or hasn't done. <br /> <br />Take Me Away: 5/5- This song really packs a punch for the first song of the album. It's a little short, being a little under 3 minutes but it is still a good song. <br /> <br />Together: 4.5/5- Another good song, the chorus is very catchy as are the lyrics. This is one of the songs you listen to then hum in your head. <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me- 4/5- Originally I didn't like this song, but after listening to it, I realized how good it was. But it took me a few listens for it to grow on me. It's probably on of the more average songs on the album. <br /> <br />He Wasn't- 4/5- This is a pretty jumpy, fast paced song which is more hard core than some of the other songs. The music is pretty good, but the lyrics weren't the best of Avril's. <br /> <br />How Does It Feel: 3/5- This is y least favorite song on the album. It never really struck me as being a good song. This lyrics are ok, as is the music. <br /> <br />My Happy Ending: 5/5- Rightfully a hit song, this one's beautiful music and lyrics really makes for a good song many can relate to. <br /> <br />Nobody's Home: 4.5/5- A slower sadder song than the others on this album, it's one of those songs you like to listen to when your sad. The music is very heartfelt as are the lyrics <br /> <br />Forgotten: 4/5- Another harsher song, this one's lyrics are basically about being \\"Forgotten\\". The music is almost haunting in the beginning and the song just seems to get darker as it goes. <br /> <br />Who Knows: 4.5/5- One of the more happy uplifting songs on the album, this one is telling people to not lose faith and keep on going. The music is definately more uplifting than most of the other songs. <br /> <br />Fall to Pieces: 4/5- This one, to me, seemed like a classical pop love song. It's music is good and the lyrics are ok, but for whatever reason, I don't really like love songs, so it lowered my opinion of it. <br /> <br />Freak Out: 4.5/5- This is another very fast jumpy song, almost fun to listen to. This song immediately grew on me and it is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Slipped Away: 5/5- This is my favorite song on the album, and probably the slowest song here. I don't know what it is with Avril's slow songs, but they always seem to catch on me. It is basically a beautiful song about losing a loved one. (In Avril's case, her grandfather) <br /> <br />Overall, I really liked this album and if you liked some of Avril's previous songs, you'll really enjoy this album.
0393061310|4.0|The read was brilliantly constructed by a multi-disciplined author.  His thesis is provocative and stimulating.  I kept feeling that had he been a trained theologian as well, the book's title might have been:  \\"Guns, Germs, Religion and Steel.\\"  Never-the-less it was well worth reading.
B00005GL0R|5.0|Bart Simpson has lived through about a thousand pranks. His greatest was fooling the whole town into giving him money and presents. He called it his &quot;Sgt Peppers&quot;. <br />To put it in a few words, this album is a testimony or rock. If we has lost speech by the time green men came around, and we had to show them something, we would sing these songs. Songs that are so carefully placed, John's rhymes and Paul's clever sounds echo into blissfull harmony. It's utter nuisance is music to my ear!<br />I can simply say this album is witty, uncanny and smart. But any good album would get that. This album, the Mona Lisa of music, is a milestone. (The invention of flight, the telephone, the TV, and Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band) To put it down without being spellbound is develish. <br />The Beatles recorded this, some say, out of pity. They had nothing to lose, really. Beatlemania was wearing down, and they knew that if they stayed normal, they would be no more than an average rock and roll band. This album showed their potential, not only as artists, but as people who knew, from the first note they played, that they were going to become ledgends. Nothing short.
B0001Z37HM|4.0|Firstly, anyone who takes this movie seriously has got a whole lotta issues! I love this movie! I grew up watching Red Sonja and thinking she was the strongest, coolest super karate warrior swordswoman on the planet! There are moments when it seems as if the entire movie just sort says \\"ok, that's all we got\\" and shows the surrounding country for way too long, (which is why I gave it 4 stars) but it was the 80's, people! If you're reading this review right now you're about 20 years too late to think the \\"special\\" effects are anything less than ridiculous! In an attempt to be honest, however, it is not quite worth the retail value price.Pay less for it or you'll feel kinda stupid (Best Buy- 6 or 7 dollars!) but no matter what, if you want a cheesy movie to sit and make fun of, and you're in the mood for some serious sword-swinging chick fight action, this is it! Buy it- if nothing else, it'll add a little spice to your dvd collection!
B000A7S4B0|3.0|with an album title like 'howl,' i was expecting a noisy record. when you make a career of thick, hazy, atmospheric, drug-induced rock, then do a 180 and release an album of completely ACOUSTIC mississippi delta blues-influenced rock, i don't know whether to feel incredibly disappointed or to applaud them for expanding their sound and trying new things.  while it's not as extreme as say, depeche mode releasing a lounge album or the flaming lips trying their hand at bossanova, it's still quite a departure. by the end of the album you'll be either scratching your head and thinking 'huh?' or pleasantly surprised, maybe even enraptured) at BRMC's softer side.<br /><br />ultimately, i don't think the album is a huge success. then again, maybe it is. it all depends on your point of view.  maybe i'm still in shock. i'm not quite sure.  i did a quick scan of the tracks when i first got the album and every song sounds generally the same--acoustic guitars, polite drums, the occassional harmonica, with narely an electric guitar in sight.  sure, the songs are acceptable, even passable (track 7, however, \\"promise\\" is a gorgeous gospel-inspired song and my personal favorite on the album); but by the end of the album you realize most of the songs sound very similar both melodically and sonically. having said that, the new pastoral sound isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a VERY different thing.<br /><br />it's a bold statement to release an album so completely different from past albums (and i give them credit for it), but it's not always a wise decision. then again, maybe it is. (can you tell i'm confused?) i hoped for some more of the gritty, grimy, sweat-soaked rock i was used to. instead, 'howl' sees the band taking a new direction (maybe the result of losing and regaining their drummer, visa issues, infighting, etc), with a sense of purpose unseen in past BRMC's records.  maybe the new BRMC will grow on me. then again, maybe it won't (but i hope it does).
B000AM4PBS|5.0|The people who are complaining and giving one star ratings about the fact that there is now a complete set upcoming with all seasons have it all wrong. The reason you are giving it a horrible rating is because you are jealous and have already forked out a lot of money (buyer's remorse). You are not actually rating this product, which is not a fair thing to do. Many of us avid fans have been waiting for a complete set because it was bound to come. If you know anything about DVD sets, you know that eventually a complete set comes out IE: Lord of the Rings, The Matrix series, etc. Nobody forced you to purchase all the individual sets. You forget that you have purchased the product and have been using it for many months now whereas many of us were waiting for this complete discounted set and watching friends reruns on tv. Giving this product a one star rating to complain is pointless... many of us have been waiting for this product and will certainly buy it. It is already moving up on the Amazon bestseller list. Only a few months to go...
B0009UC7H0|4.0|Before you watch this movie, one thing: Don't compare it with Indiana Jones. Everybody does that, while Sahara is it's completely own film. Of course Dirk Pitt is a bit like Indiana Jones: an archeologist who has the greatest adventures imagable.   But Sahara stands on it's own feed, putting Indiana Jones aside. It's adventure with a new name indeed: Dirk Pitt.    The story of the movie is losely based on the story of the book. It's a great story. It has lots of breathtaking action (a boat chase, an actionpacked beginning, a shootout, a clymaxing end, a trainjump and much more), suspence,  beautiful locations (The niger river, the Sahara desert, and others).   It has a great hero (Matthew McConaughey is perfect as Dirk Pitt), a beautiful lady (Penelope Cruz as the beautiful and sexy Eva Rojas), and a fun sidekick (Steve Zahn in a great hilarious part). But also the music is great to listen to, and bring even more excitment to the film (Clint Mansell has done a fantastic job creating a perfect adventure theme).   With other words: this movie is as hot as the Sahara itself!    Another thing that just can't be missed: the humor. McConaughey and Zahn have a great camestry which brings funny scenes and situations. For example: the escape from the riding car is hilarious!  The word is that there is a sequel coming. I can't wait!    So if you're in for a ride full of adventure, action, humor, romance and suspence: watch \\"Sahara\\".  It will give you two hours of pure desert heated fun!
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I agree with everybody that this is a great show.  I also agree with people in that those who bought the individual seasons got screwed out of the complete box set.  But, I don't get why you all are rating this product with low stars.  The rating should be based on the PRODUCT, not whether or not you got screwed.  You ruin the average rating with your low scores.  If you want to complain, then do, but give this box set its proper dues and rate it accordingly.  It's the complete Friends set in a great looking box.  With that said, I don't own this product, but hope to buy it because I'm a huge fan of the show and think this set would be a great buy for any Friends fan.
0743455967|5.0|Absolutely riveting book for anyone who even thinks they want to write.  Honest but grounded in the real world.  Challenges you to ask if you really want to commit to the process but shows you how to do so in real-world language with examples from his well-known classics.  MUST READ for wannabe writers.
0070511136|2.0|I can see where this book might make supplemental reading, but it is so obvious that the author and his subjects are not real sales people. <br /> <br />The most useful part of this book was the section on implication questions. The problem is it leaves you with some decent questions to ask, but, now what the heck am I am supposed to do? <br /> <br />And the concept is not new. Zig Ziglar has been teaching the same process along with his top trainer, Brian Flanigan. Ziglar calls it POGO and you can read about it in Zigler on Selling. You will also find more useful information th an what is available here. Perhaps that is because Ziglar and Flanigan are real salesmen and have taught hundreds of thousands of successful salespeople techniques that work now for over 40 years. <br /> <br />Perhaps Rackam took a Zig Ziglar seminar or bought his book and is trying to pass his ideas as being original. <br /> <br />If you want to see this book, go to your local library where you can borrow it for free or buy it for $2.50 or less at a used bookstore.
B000A5TJA2|4.0|I have no idea what the previous reviewer was griping about but I received the actual movie and it looks and sounds great! All the songs are in Dolby Digital and the movie looks good. I had been looking for this movie and now my Beatles movie collection is complete!
B000002UB3|5.0|WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO IT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AMAZING EITHER. AFTER A FEW LISTENS I REALIZED IT WAS. ALSO THERE ARE MANY CLASSIC SONGS ON THIS. THE ALBUM NEEDS TO BE RE-MASTERED BUT IT IS AMAZING.  <br />TRY IT OUT A FEW MORE TIMES OR HOLD ONTO IT FOR WHEN YOU GET A LITTLE OLDER.
0783230079|5.0|I have been LOOKING for this movie forever! I knew the movie itself, but for some reason, I couldn't remember the name of it! I'm so happy that I've found this. :) This has to be one of my favorite movies and my definate favorite of a Robert Downey Jr. film. This movie has it all...inspiration, comedy, nuturing, drama...you name it. This DVD will definately be my \\"next to get\\" DVD list. Anyone who has not seen this, you're missing out. Believe me, it's worth it worth it worth it! Just by reading most of the reviewers here tells you what I'm trying to say.  <br /> <br />You can't miss on this one! B)
0141301155|4.0|Ha, this book is great, and I am 28 years old. am fairly The high of this book is a sugar rush...lots of fun~ and I am not going to say, \\"I am reading it to my kids\\", as I don't have any! Roald Dahl was a great man and thank you to those quirky school teachers who had enough guts to read his stuff to us when we were young. Dahl is dark, but hey life is not all roses, so to those parents out there who \\"tut tut\\" over Dahl, and the \\"scary\\" images he conjures up...get over it and stop being so politically correct!
0316926345|5.0|Everyone is probably familiar with the PBS version of Evelyn Waugh's best known, and quite possibly best written, work.  This is the story of Charles Ryder's nostalgic narration of what he experienced years prior to the war....as an officer he finds himself stationed back at the old Marchmain Manor \\"Brideshead\\".  He recalls his meeting with the tragic Sebastian, Lord and Lady Marchmain and their daughter Julia...whom he wants to marry. Interspersed throughtout the novel is the subject of religion.  The Marchmain's had converted to Catholicism while Charles, having no religious upbringing, was Agnostic.  The 'Twitch upon a thread' metaphor is played upon as the Marchmains close in on the eternities.<br /><br />As he closes this chapter of his life, Charles reflects...\\"Something quite remote from anything the builders intended has come out of their work, and out of the fierce little human tragedy in which I played: something none of us thought about at the time; a small red flame--a beaten-copper lamp of deplorable design relit before the beaten-copper doors of a tabernacle; the flame which the old knights saw from their tombs, which they saw put out; that flame burns again for other soldiers, far from home, farther, in heart, than Acre or Jerusalem.  It could not have been lit but for the builders and the tragedians, and there I found it this morning, burning anew among the old stones.\\"<br /><br />Read this work and get Charles' perspective on this fierce little human tragedy and the rekindling of that old flame lit once again in his life.  Love can emerge from suffering.  After all the vicissitudes Charles endures, he still finds the flame burning anew in the old Chapel.  I guess you could classify this as Charles' epiphany.
B00008OLYN|1.0|The whole prog-metal thing is getting exceptionally old.  Europe continues to release these ridiculous bands that sound too much like bands that we already have here in America!!!  While I do understand that bands are traditionally inspired by other bands, I just dont think it works with all of these European acts.  We created Prog Rock with Pink Floyd and we created Speed/Death metal with Metallica.  Hearing another copycat is tiring and just plain pathetic.  The singer does have a great voice; his heavy singing is very reminiscent to James Hetfied and his light voice sounds quite a bit like Staind's lead singer.  I might give this band some respect if they had a gun to my head, but since they dont, I think they desperately need to find a new sound.  It may sound decent to virgin ears of American prog-metal, but to those who have eaten up the genre, its been done before.  If you would like to hear some authentic prog metal, check out Staind, Seven Mary Three, or even 3 Days Grace.  Peace Out-Franky

B0009QBLA8|3.0|I first found this movie from a friend, a movie fan. I later got a \\"bootleg\\" on VHS from a Laser Disk. In my more recent incarnation of movie binge buying, I decided to pick this movie up. Twenty years of my life has done this:  <br />1. I understand the movie better. <br />2. I like the movie less. <br /> <br />The movie is about...oops I don't want to let the cat out of the bag. The movie lacks real action, dialogue, and has the feel of an old, cheap plastic toy...classic, yet not intended to stand the test of time. Movie buffs will love it, people on drugs will love it, Lynch fans will love it. Most people will hate it. If you want a movie to fill in the blanks for you, Eraserhead is not your bag. The movie is not exactly rife with plot twists, but its completely untrodden ground, so you have no idea where you'll end up anyway.  <br /> <br />If you like movies that are visually and psychologically challenging, then Eraserhead is for you. <br /> <br />I was also disappointed to find out that the subtitles were Korean.  <br /> <br />I should also add that you couldn't make me give up my copy of Eraserhead for anything; it's quintessential.
0446672653|5.0|Brian Weiss is a credited psychotherapist and professor of psychology at the University of Miami. When working with patients, he specializes in hypnotherapy. Weiss is a strong advocate of the theory of reincarnation of the soul. He uses hypnosis as a key to get into his patients' past lives. Weiss analyzes the events that occurred and the people present in them that shape who they are in their current flesh. Only Love is Real is a book that explains how the soul creates an attachment to the people it has associated with in other lives, thus realizing the term \\"soulmate.\\" He explains how a soulmate can be in the form of a friend, mother, father, sibling, and most notably a lover. Only Love is Real is Weiss' log of the hypnotherapy between two patients from very different backgrounds that proves his belief on soulmates. Elizabeth was seeing Dr. Weiss to deal with the recent death of her mother and to find answers to her problems with relationships. Pedro was undergoing past-life regression therapy with Dr. Weiss to solve his personal troubles. The two were complete strangers to each other. While undergoing the hypnotherapy, Weiss made the shocking discovery that Elizabeth and Pedro were precisely describing the same lives. They were not strangers at all, in fact, they were soulmates. The two had lost each other during the transition of lives and their souls brought them together again under the therapy of Dr. Weiss. Weiss was to serve as the median between two long-lost lovers. In what could have been a career-destroying move, Weiss goes on to reuniting the souls after years of solitude, and proving that \\"Only Love is Real.\\" <br />  <br />     I had already grown a personal respect for Dr. Brian Weiss after reading his debut work, Many Lives, Many Masters, which explains and reinforces the idea that our souls have one purpose in the world, and go through many lives to achieve that goal. I feel one can only fully appreciate his following book Only Love is Real after being exposed to his beliefs in Many Lives, Many Masters. There is often controversy surrounding the validity and truthfulness to his works, but I think that is unimportant. I do not think his books are to be taken as a bible, but rather as mind-opening, spiritually-stimulating guides to help one realize that not everything may be what is commonly accepted. Because the fact is, people often use religion as comfort zones in order not explore what is unknown to them. I know because I was one of them. I was raised in a standard Catholic household. There was heaven if you were good and hell if you were bad, and that was it. I am personally attached to Weiss' works because, although I may not particularly believe in everything he writes about, they serve as internally maturing guides that help me realize what I personally have faith in, and not what people have been drilling into my head since I was baptized.  <br />
B0002TT0NM|5.0|I'm always amazes at J. K. Rowling's imagination. She is a superior story teller.I was on the edge of my seat from the first page to the last. I'm 72 years old and I can't think of any story that has fascinated me the way the Harry Potter Adventure Series does. I hope I live long enought to be able to read the last or the rest of her books.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I first heard Renee Olstead sing on a digital music channel on cable.  I was in another room from which I could barely hear her, but her rendition of \\"Summertime\\" was so unusual that I jumped up to catch the name of the singer while it was still displayed on the screen.  I purchased the CD based upon hearing that one song.  I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I was blown away.  Renee's vocal range, and interpretation of these standards makes her far and away the best female jazz singer to come on the scene in the last 10 years.  I was stunned when I learned after several listenings of her CD, that Renee is still a teenager.  I've since read criticisms that she lacks the chops to sing these classics from the American Songbook with true feeling.  Well, I'm sorry, but I've heard most of female torch singers who have lived and experienced it all, and they couldn't sing backup for this girl. If she is singing with borrowed emotion, she borrowed from the best.  On \\"Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?\\" her rendition is at least the equal of Dinah Washington's excellent version of the song. The key to Renee is not how she sounds like top singers from the past, but how she makes each song uniquely her own. Her interpretations are fresh and energetic.  Just listening to the first two songs on the CD, \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Taking A Chance on Love,\\" tells you that this is a very special singer.  When her next album appears, I'll be among the first to order a copy. If Renee stays in this genre, and I hope she does, she'll be at the top of the field for decades to come.
B000000W5N|5.0|When the Technicolour dream of the 1960s finally ended, it was time to face the reality of the new decade, especially for rock bands. The Beatles bowed out early, so their friendly rivals the Rolling Stones were left standing to sit atop the throne. However, that is not to say things happened to the band behind the scenes that could easily have caused them to go the Beatles' way.<br /><br />Former guitarist Brian Jones died mysteriously on July 3, 1969, and had been replaced by Mick Taylor only a few songs into the sessions for LET IT BLEED. December 6 of that year was the infamous Altamont free concert that officially signified the dream of peace & love was over. But instead of coming unglued, the Stones were merely softened (at least temporarily), and thus encouraged to become more introspective. 1971's STICKY FINGERS was certainly their lowest-key album yet, save for some obvious rockers.<br /><br />That STICKY FINGERS manages to be a uniformly outstanding affair is a wonder considering that the songs were recorded in different places at different times, rather than going for a certain ambience in that one studio. It also even had songs that were essentially outtakes, but went on to become classics all the same. That is right, \\"Brown Sugar\\" & \\"Wild Horses\\" had been recorded in Muscle Shoals, during the Stones' infamous 1969 American Tour. That they stand as some of STICKY FINGERS' hardest tracks comes as no surprise.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Brown Sugar\\" became the Stones' sixth #1 hit in America in spite of (or maybe because of) its questionable lyrics that were either racist, sexist, drug-related...or all three. Still, even the most politically correct listeners cannot deny that it is one of the Stones' gloriously rocking tunes ever, especially with Keith Richards' most inventive opening guitar riff until \\"Start Me Up\\". Jim Price & Bobby Keys' horns still manage to cut through the aural hysteria like a razor.<br /><br />Even the considerably more subdued \\"Wild Horses\\" has a pronounced edge to it, managing to sound heartwarming even with a vocal from Mick Jagger that was probably rough from cigarettes & alcohol. Sure, it only reached #28 & does not get the kind of airplay \\"Brown Sugar\\" still does, yet \\"Wild Horses\\" showed the Stones were still releasing quality singles at a time when AM Gold pop was reigning supreme.<br /><br />\\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is more like an embryonic song idea that is just the launching pad for a 7-minute scorching jam that is not unlike what Santana would have created on any of their first 3 albums.<br /><br />The only other song on STICKY FINGERS that equals the madness of \\"Brown Sugar\\" is \\"Bitch\\", once again with the horns practically being the main reason why it rocks so hard. Of course, the tendency is to assume a legendarily-chauvinistic band like the Stones is creating yet another song about a bad little woman. But however, the song basically is saying that life is a bitch, not a certain unnamed female. I wonder if calling the song by this name was rather revolutionary for 1971 (considering the eventual controversy over 1973's \\"Star Star\\").<br /><br />With a great part of STICKY FINGERS having been recorded at Mick Jagger's house with the Stones' newly-built mobile unit, there you have the reason why the album has a reputation of being one of their looser, less heavy affairs. The aforementioned \\"Bitch\\" was recorded there, but about everything else was more mellowed, yet uneasily so. \\"Sway\\" has a menacing vibe to it even with a rhythm that invites the title action rather than headbanging.<br /><br />The Stones return to their blues roots with Reverend Gary Davis' \\"You Gotta Move\\" which follows \\"Street Fighting Man\\"'s method of creating an air of terror without an electric guitar in sight. Aerosmith's recent cover has absolutely nothing on the Stones' take, showing that not all white boys have soul, but a few have been blessed.<br /><br />\\"I Got The Blues\\" is said to have been the song that inspired Jon Bon Jovi to start writing songs, and maybe he knows something other listeners do not because it is indeed one of the Stones' truly lost classics. Sounding like a lost Stax outtake, the horns again come close to stealing the show, alongside Billy Preston's trusty organ work. Oh, how people like Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett could have tore this one up!<br /><br />The drug exploits of the Stones in the 1970s (especially those of Keith Richards) are foreshadowed eerily on \\"Sister Morphine\\", partly inspired by Mick Jagger's then-girlfriend Marianne Faithfull's near-fatal heroin overdose. One song that is openly scary & not afraid to be so, even now, you may want to listen to this song only in the daytime, and even better, it may scare you off drugs for good.<br /><br />Towards the end of STICKY FINGERS, the nightmarish atmosphere somewhat lifts on the final two tracks. \\"Dead Flowers\\" sends up twang-heavy country music even as it manages to be a fine document of the genre itself. I cannot find a song that has a major Keith Richards influence (he had just begun to sing lead on a song or two per album), but given his friendship with country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons, I can guess this would be a reasonable antecedent. \\"Dead Flowers\\" also manages to be yet another inventive way of telling a mistreating mate where to go.<br /><br />The sun then finally rises on the closing \\"Moonlight Mile\\", which gives probably the best idea of the communal vibe that surrounded STICKY FINGERS & would continue onto 1972's EXILE ON MAIN ST. The strings & vocals may have been added later, but the rest of the music was done live, and the warmth it all radiates is palpable. After a nearly 40-minute long musical bad dream (but a glorious one nevertheless), \\"Moonlight Mile\\" is the song that helps you realize it was one after all.<br /><br />While the Beatles may have caved in before the decade was barely new, the Rolling Stones proved to be just at the beginning of their superstar period when STICKY FINGERS became their first #1 album in 6 years, and also was the first in an enviable stretch of 8 consecutive albums to top the charts. Some would say a few of those reached that position undeservedly, but you certainly could not include STICKY FINGERS in that category because it managed to rock like hell even when the menace was more seductive than violent.pired Jon Bon Jovi to start writing songs, and maybe he knows something other listeners do not because it is indeed one of the Stones' truly lost classics.

B00027JZ3E|5.0|What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?  GREAT story, great casting, great sets...JUST GREAT!!!  I was IMMEDIATELY hooked on Lost Boys from the second I saw it.  Too bad Keifer and Jason went through that \\"Julia\\" thing...I think they worked well together and had great chemistry in LB.  AND RIGHT ABOUT NOW KEIFER IS DA MAN!!!   <br /> <br />For me, THIS film is what attracted me to his acting (as well as the 2 Coreys).  LOST BOYS WILL ALWAYS BE IN MY TOP 10...THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER MOVIE LIKE IT!!!!
B0007NMKB2|5.0|...however I liked the different changes in tempo, sudden screaming, the bursts of guitar shredding that came with the previous two albums. This album is just a bit more refined. The production is cleaner, bass isn't providing its own harmony but mirroing the notes of the guitar, the punk/hardcore edge is tamed. Passion, anguish, and the aggression is still there, the band is just more restrained. If you're big on the first album this may take some getting used to as the songs don't meander into unexpected territory as was evident on the debut. You will enjoy this if you liked the other two. \\"Budge\\" and \\"Let It Ride\\" should convince you to buy this album.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I am a huge fan of Avenged Sevenfold. I have been listening to them since \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\". This CD is not dissapointing in respect to the lyrics in the least. It adds a new and energetic sound to A7X. The Reverand (drummer) definately stepped it up and, as a drummer myself, I just think it's incredible. The rest of the band puts in incredible music also.  Sidewinder shows that with the last 2.5 minutes switching from raging vocals and guitars to a Latin extravaganza with accoustic guitars (including an amazing solo), timbalis, and smooth lyrics.  There are no screams unlike A7X's previous albums but that was, in part, to lose the fans from the metalcore scene that A7X didn't want to be apart of anymore. The lyrics have changed a little, there has never been a Parental Advisory CD by Avenged Sevenfold (but this one is probably due to the fact that they are on a corporate label this time around). Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had a few f-words in it and Waking The Fallen had no swearing what-so-ever. All-in-all, if you're an old Avenged Sevenfold fan it will take a few listens to get used to the new style, but new fans should definately be able to jump right in.  I got the chance to see these guys live (and get their autographs) and let me tell you they are an amazing band, don't miss out!  If you've got the cash pick up this and \\"Waking the Fallen\\".
B00003CX9E|1.0|I consider myself an analytical individual.  If this film is for the intellectuals and analytically minded, then this analytical personality must be nine cents short of a dime in the cerebral department because I found this to be the most boring piece of schlock I have ever sat through in my entire life.  So for those \\"intellectuals\\" who think they are better than everyone else just because they happen to like \\"Citizen Kane\\", I'm proud to be an idiot who likes movies for escapism and not for analytical purposes.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I saw this movie without ever seeing, or knowing about, the original. That said, the first time I saw this movie it was such a laughfest, I almost went crazy and couldn't stop laughing. Without revealing much about the plot, if you are into comedies and sports, this is a must see.
B00004YB9Y|5.0|First, let me state I don't listen to opera singers that much; thus, don't expect a hypercritical review here. (Really, is there ANY field of music that has more hypercritics than opera?) I got this CD simply because Columbia House had it on sale for $2.99, and I wanted some new Christmas CDs.<br /><br />I found the CD delightful beyond words. It has some beautiful versions of well-known Christmas songs, as well as songs I've never heard before. \\"Carol of the Drum\\" and \\"War Is Over\\" are my two favorites, with \\"Sleigh Ride\\" a close third.<br /><br />Sure, there is some tripping over of words by these three great opera stars...but that makes it even more enhancing in my opinion. Pavarotti was particularly amusing when he was singing: \\"And all our friends are calling 'HOO-HOO'!\\" (Watch the DVD for Carreras' reaction to that one!) And let's not forget Pavarotti singing: \\"I'll be home for Christmas.  You can PLAY on me.\\"<br /><br />The children's chorus is great, the Vienna Symphony is great...and, once again, buy or rent the DVD so you can get the full affect of this astounding Christmas concert...the music, the lights, the colors, and the marvelous Steven Mercurio conducting it all.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|...you can't stop watching it.  Though many reviewers have tried, you'd be working way too hard to to try to ascribe some deep philosophical meaning to it.  It is what it is:  a mindless and mildly entertaining film.  It's quirky characters are quirky, it's snooty in-crowd is snooty and it it offers a number of quotable lines.  I wouldn't be surprised to see it become a cult-classic.  It's already water-cooler fodder.

0596009208|1.0|This book is not up to this publisher's high standards. It is full of pictures, looking more like a comic book than a serious text. Pictures (and not screenshots, either) serve the same purpose as blank space and pretend characters: they take up space that the buyer has paid for and expects to find filled with substance.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Saint Germain's Tourist is one of the really good albums to come out in the last few years.  Earthlink featured it for a week and it was worth it.  One of my media players classified it as \\"acid jazz,\\" which it is definitely not.  It is cool, has a semi-lounge feel and is almost hot in places.  It is definitely not \\"smooth jazz,\\" and though it is similarly relaxing, it could be used for party music or just to lay back and relax.  I've got it in my car CD changer and it'll stay there for a while.  If you buy just a dozen non-smooth jazz CD's this year, this should for sure be one of them.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Watching this movie for the very first time, I was awestruck at the computer effects used in this movie. Did you know that \\"Tron\\" was the very first motion picture to use constant computer graphics? <br /> <br />The sound effects were cool as well - reminds me of \\"On The Run\\" by Pink Floyd and \\"Threshold\\" by Steve Miller! <br /> <br />If you consider this a \\"really old\\" Disney movie (\\"really old\\" referring to 60s and 70s movies), then you will be amazed at the effects as well.

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The first time through the Bourne Supremacy, I was convinced it was better than the first.  The story and pacing were tighter.  There seemed to be fewer plot inconsistencies.  Unfortunately, there were still a couple of nagging points that, on second watching, are so egregious as to take you out of the supposedly \\"realistic\\" action.  In a film with a lower realism standard, the mistakes would be forgivable, but not in a film like this were everything depends on the credibility of the action. <br /> <br />First, the good points.  The DVD picture and sound are great.  The jerky camera movements and editing style enhance the viewing experience (but I can understand how those watching it in a theatre might come away motion-sick).  There are a few scenes of sublime brilliance - when Bourne tracks Joan Allen's character, the latter parts of the Moscow car chase (in the tunnel), Bourne threatening the Julia Stiles character.  These scenes highlight the intense action and energy of both the action set-pieces and the acting, which is top-rate throughout. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there are some of major problems: (a) there are too many (and overlong) car chases.  I like a good car chase as much as the next guy, but there's no way that poor car of Bourne's could still be running after all it's been through in the second chase scene.  Again, in a less \\"realistic\\" movie, it could be forgiven, but not here.  And wouldn't it have been more fun if the taxi he stole was a Lada instead of a Mercedes (as with the Mini in the first film)?  (b) By having Jason be alone through the film, there is little opportunity for character development because he has no one to talk with.  Granted, Matt Damon does a good job with his face and body language, but it's not the same.  (c) Most critically - why OH WHY?!? is the fight scene with the other CIA assassin in this film?  Nothing about the scene makes sense - How does Bourne know he exists? how does Bourne find him? why does he attack Bourne?why does Bourne kill him?  Obviously, the director (or writer?) decided the film needed a big hand-to-hand combat scene, and cooked this scene up even though it makes no sense.  In a Jackie Chan movie, this scene would be fine.  In this movie, it's like a comedy cartoon stuffed into the middle of a drama. <br /> <br />The extras on the DVD are somewhat entertaining, including some cut scenes which look like they were cut for good reason.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|dudes, this movie is like bladerunner meets stigmatta, or some sh**.  like,, i can appreciate the steppin out on a limb reinterpreting angels, the bible, hell, and all t he rules.  but, dude, when you make the archangle, like, a bisexual hoo-hoo, well, it doens't say a lot for the filmmakers sense of goodness in the world.  i mean, wow, what a bleak outlook on sh**.  like, time to do an intervention with that filmmaker, get him some help, dude.  but it did scare me, and i though it was tight, the satan dude rocked!  and the part at the end where the plot twist forced satan back down was awesome... what else... duede this review is too long... i'm out.  j.
0767827902|5.0|Along with \\"Paper Moon,\\" this is director Bogdanovich's crowning achievement, a poignant, evocative film about people and places that life has passed by, leaving a gnawing emptiness.  Ben Johnson won a well-deserved Oscar playing Sam.  Adapted from Larry McMurtry's book by the director and McMurtry.  Haunting, atmospheric, and deeply felt.
0486424510|4.0|This is the original murder mystery novel. It predates other mystery/crime giants such as Agatha Chrisite and Dorothy Sayers. I can understand that for someone used to today's style of writing, this book may seem a bit old fashioned, but it pays to remember that it was written in the late 1800s and is one of the reasons why this genre of novels is so popular today. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to all murder mystery fans.
B00005ASOI|5.0|Genuine chills and gore aplenty from shock-meister Dario Argento, \\"Suspiria\\" is anything but subtle, with some obvious dubbing work likely to cause some opening nervous chuckles. But you won't be laughing for long, as initial eeriness quickly segues to scenes of sheer terror. Not recommended for kids.  An ideal Halloween movie.
0895260131|5.0|Mr. Spencer knows his facts and is willing to debate any Muslim anywhere on the facts in his book.  I have listened to several of his debates and his Muslim opponents can't provide evidence that the Koran is accurate or dispute that Islam had its orgins in the pagan moongods of Arabia.  His book is excellent and he can support his facts with references to impartial academic sources.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Savage human drama wrapped up in an adventure film. Containing humor, suspense and action, its a striking meditation on the nature of greed. One of John Huston's (and Bogart's) best films, Huston's father Walter, also took home an Oscar that year for his superb performance.
B00023B1LC|5.0|The chief interest with this extended version is the new beginning and ending that can be played instead of the original.  Both versions are available so it is up to the viewer as to which to choose.  This is not a director's cut of the film since there is a message (or a disclaimer) that Doug Liman did not participate.  Prior to the start of the extended version is a discussion with the producer and writer as to why the extended version was issued and why, after September 11, the decision was made to tone down the film by removing explosions from the ending.   I found the discussion a bit long-winded and skipped out of it to the movie.  <br /> <br />The changes to the film relate the action in a flash back.  Jason is in Greece searching for Marie when he gets a positive identification from a tourist and is drinking a bottle of Orangina when he topples over.  Cut to the start of the theatrical version of the film.   I have not read any of Robert Ludlum's books so I do not know how they compare to the movie.  However, a direct translation of the books to the screen is not possible: there is far too much to include.    <br /> <br />I saw the Bourne Identity the weekend it was released and liked it from the start.  The intent of the film was to make a fast paced action movie but without creating sensational stunts that did not advance the story.   Still the fight sequences and the chase in the streets of Paris are extraordinary.  More important is the chemistry between the amnesic Jason and Marie, the hard-up German girl who agrees to give him a ride from Zurich to Paris.  As we get closer to knowing who and what Jason Bourne is, it is the developing relationship between Marie and Jason that holds our attention.  <br /> <br />After watching the film to just about the very end, you can switch to the alternate ending. The new ending has Jason Bourne waking up with Brian Cox, who had ordered the murder of Chris Cooper's character.  Mr. Cox seems rather avuncular in this scene and informs Jason of where Marie is but lets him know that Treadstone is not more and he can do the odd killing job if he wants to.  The alternate ending is a little too neat for me and I don't think it adds anything to the film; interesting but not necessary.  <br /> <br />Of the extra features, there is an interesting look at Robert Ludlum through interviews with the author and some of his friends.  We also get a look at some of the stunts, a professional diagnosis of why Jason Bourne developed amnesia and interviews.   If you already have The Bourne Identity on DVD I do not think you need to buy this version.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0312995423|2.0|Digital Fortress has the feel and packaging of well researched fiction. Set in contemporary times (at the time of writing, 1998) Dan creates appealing plot and pace. Unfortunately he sets the stage in a strangely depicted set. For example, I am not sure if the book is trying to suggest a fantasy country, but what's on the book is not 1998 Spain. Try somewhere else, or perhaps Spain in the 1950s or 1960s? After reading about the deadly steps on the Giralda and the urine smell in the hospital  I couldn't help but look at the writting feeling it didn't have a good fit and finish. It left a taste of very weak fit and finish. <br />
0962477060|5.0|I have followed the usual path many guitar players have gone down. However, like most, I came to a dead end. I would get bored, frustrated, and confused with the rote style of trying to learn this wonderful instrument. <br />I would let my acoustic guitar sit in its case for months, and sometimes years. On occasion I would take it out now and then only to play for a few months only to repeat the madness of this continuing cycle. <br /> I started with all the usual method books with which I am sure you are all familiar, took lessons for a few years with such books only to be playing Red River Valley, Michael Row the Boat Ashore, etc. In my case these were not exactly the kind of songs I was looking to play to amaze my friends. Yes, they taught me some music theory and I learned to read music, but it was all based around the piano without specifically applying it to the distinctive patterns of the guitar's fretboard layout. I managed to figure out a few licks note by note, the hard way with guess work, or the usual put your first finger here, second finger there mentality, but I still could not figure how to improvise and know where I could go to next without being limited inside some so-called box. As your typical acoustic player my range was limited to the open position and was lucky if I could do anything past the fifth fret. How many of you fellow acoustic players know exactly what I mean? <br /> I looked into the so-called \\"Rock Methods\\" out there along with the so-called learn these hot licks books. The books were solely based on one scale form in one box and maybe a blues box. Geesh, for crying out loud I wanted out of the box. I wanted to be able to play starting in the open position, from the 1st fret to beyond the 12th, and most importantly understand the logic and reasoning behind knowing how to do just that. I spent a lot of my hard earned cash on methods and chord catalogs that are now collecting dust in my closet. I even had many chord books given to meby friends who were overwhelmed by trying learn from chord books thicker than the phone book.  <br />Since I came across Fretboard Logic I can honestly say I now have a solid foundation with my guitar. I can play the length of the entire fretboard, I can improvise, build chords without referring to that book with hundreds of pictures, and I am able to start learning some of the riffs and songs that before were really out of my reach. I would highly recommend getting the videos to compliment the book for they are the icing on the cake. It is like having Mr. Edwards teaching you at home at your own pace and gives reinforcement. His website also has listings of teachers who use Fretboard Logic exclusively with their students if you are interested in finding one in your area. <br />Read the reviews PRAISING the book. This is not the best selling guitar book on Amazon because he was pulling the wool over people's eyes. The positive reviews far outweigh those from detractors. Apparently the negative reviewers did not understand what they were learning or else were angry because one part of this six-part series did not contain the contents of another. Because of the harshness of this minority of detractors, one might logically begin to wonder why they are posing as authoritative on these subjects with absolutely no credentials. I am particularly annoyed with the comment \\"it will set you at odds with how everyone else plays music.\\" I find this to be just the opposite. We are not reinventing the wheel here, I am now able to understand what the heck is going on and can communicate music-wise and understand what other players are doing and apply it to the guitar with complete confidence. The individual who quotes \\"\\"people should get this information from the Internet instead\\" particularly rankles. I really have a problem with that statement. Those Internet sites will show you one or maybe two scale forms. However, they also want you sign up for a fee to get the rest of the information in detail which are nothing but copying or should I really say \\"stealing\\" the intellectual property rights and taking credit for it. Plus they want you to buy their CD of jam tracks. Jam tracks are included in the Fretboard Logic videos. Check out for yourself the copyright dates (early 80s, meaning before the WWW), and you'll understand whose intellectual property rights all those internet me-toos and wannabes are violating. I don't know about you but I prefer to turn to the original source. I really had to shake my head at the websites selling how you can play like the guitar gods in a matter of weeks not years and then emphasize \\"this is not the CAGED system.\\" It reminded me of the dream away diet advertised on TV years back. A few detractors have mentioned it teaches no theory. I strongly disagree; he introduces the student to music theory beginning in Volume I with naming chords, scales, and the lead patterns, going into more depth in Volumes II and III. After laying a solid foundation with the guitar, as the student progresses, more theory is introduced that can then be built upon according to each student's interest and direction. You are not limited to any one music style or guitar type in this series. I am sorry, but those who say you need to teach reading music or deep theory first are not thinking outside of the box. You do not have to be a great note reader to play guitar or music in general. Look at Jose Feliciano, or Ray Charles or even the Beatles, for example. It is up the student to decide how far into theory he or she wishes to explore. This is surely the best guitar book I have ever owned. Fretboard Logic was the key that made the door of understanding the guitar open wide for me. It is now up to me, and hopefully you, when you make the right decision to use this book, where you want to go from there. <br /> It is true, no one book or teacher can make you a great guitarist. It takes self-motivation, plenty of practice, and most importantly, a strong desire in your heart. I urge you, especially the beginner guitarist and advanced, do not, let me repeat that, DO NOT, let the small minority scare you off from this book. The road to success is always under construction. If you want the proper tools to reach your guitar goals, with a keep it simple approach, I wholeheartedly recommend Fretboard Logic to have inside your guitarist tool chest. You won't be sorry. <br />  <br />

B0009VRHLK|4.0|Another review below has made the point that the critics started a process whereby this film has become vilified.  I won't rehash that, but it's unfortunate. <br /> <br />Gallo certainly does test the limits of his audience and, as a result, this film will not have a wide audience.  But if you're someone who appreciates the power of cinema you may well find something to like in this film.  Gallo makes things difficult on himself by forcing the film to rely almost entirely on a visual language.  Gallo's character says almost nothing.  What we know about him is what we see: his appearance, his motorcycle, his van. What we see him doing is less important than what we *never* see him doing: he doesn't seem to have a job or any fixed responsibilities or schedule, and he's certainly short on human contact. From his relationship with his ex-girlfriend we learn that others see something of value in him that he himself can't.  But while he seems fully isolated from the world, he also seems universal.  In his isolation he is like each of us, and Gallo steadfastly refuses to give the character any more personality than is necessary, so as to avoid interfering with the character's universal quality.  I think what makes the film so unsettling to many is that Gallo's pointless odyssey is not so different than the one many of the rest of us are on. <br /> <br />As to whether it's the worst film ever made, well, that's not even remotely accurate.  It's true that The Brown Bunny won't do the tricks of a mainstream Hollywood film, but it is powerful in its own way and never hits a false note.  It is far more deft, controlled and virtuosic in its own way than, say, a mess of a film like \\"Kingdom of Heaven.\\" It makes David Lynch look downright vaudevillian. With its echos of Bergman, Fassbinder, Wenders and Hellman it's quite an accomplished work.  (Those of you who can't agree with me should at least try the somewhat more communicative \\"Buffalo 66\\").
B0008ISM40|1.0|Please beware that the Amazon description does not make it clear that this Dualdisc album will not play in most cd players.

B00003CXCT|5.0|As a teenager, I saw the original film open in the cinemas, now I'm showing and explaining the films in this great epic to my five year old.  He's unable to watch all of episodes IV and V as they do have scary parts, but episode VI is perfect for him (under supervision only), and its also my favourite.  He's also enjoyed episodes I and II, but for me they are too grand and broad a scale for me to enjoy as much as the close action and character involvement of the episodes IV - VI.  My son was so sad to see yoda die, and he was so curious about the Ewoks.  I picked this set up at the shops yesterday for US$50.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Gold came out in the late summer of 2001.  The opening track, \\"New York New York,\\" became something of a rallying cry for me (and other New Yorkers and Americans) after 9/11, even though the song-- as one colleague described it, \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" played fast-- is about a girl, not a city.  (Adams sometimes writes about a girl by using the name of a city he associates with her; see also, \\"Dear Chicago.\\")  But the very fact that this tune evoked the familiar Dylan song is precisely what makes this work so compelling and timeless.<br /><br />OK, so given the timing, that tune sucked me into the record, in a very visceral way.  But the whole thing had masterpiece written all over it from the very first spin at my home in September of 2001.  As my wife so aptly said, \\"It has that sweet familliar ring of every album you ever loved as a kid.\\"  Which, if you are our age, means it feels like Van Morrison, Neil Young, Dylan, Exile-era Stones, like that.  It hits you in that \\"Into the Mystic,\\" \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\" place.  Do you like that place?  Yeah, me too.<br /><br />Adams is so prolific an artist that he is generally an album or two ahead of his fans; by February of 2001 he was playing these rockers to rooms full of alt.country romantics who wanted to moon with him over the Heartbreaker songs.  But now, four years on, \\"New York New York,\\" \\"Answering Bell,\\" \\"Stars Go Blue,\\" and \\"Rescue Blues\\" sound like songs you've known all your life, and are warmly greeted in concert as the masterworks they are.<br /><br />Adams is a polarizing figure; people tend to have strong opinions toward him, either way.  I obviously lean toward the \\"love everything he touches\\" camp.  But divorced from the public persona, the music on this disc stands up to the closest scrutiny, taps into a classic vein defined by the artists listed above (and more recently, by Lucinda Williams and Counting Crows).  I hate to compare one artist to others, but I find it a helpful construct in providing buying advice; its the \\"recommended if you like...\\" concept.  If you've read this far, I think you know whether you want to buy this or not.<br /><br />If not, I'll add that if I were to suggest a single title to someone interested in getting their ears wet with Adams, this would be the one.

031286504X|4.0|I AM LEGEND is one of the most important vampires stories written.  A lot of what hollywood has done with both vampire and zombies come from this novella.

If you like this kind of stuff then you need to read this.<br /><br />You need to read this before the movie comes out.  Too good of a novella to not be read before the movie makes a mockery of the story.
B00008S2VG|3.0|This is Madonna's least interesting album since just about ever, if you don't count soundtrack tie-ins as \\"real\\" albums.  It's not bad, it's just not all that good.  I guess some people agreed with me, because it's the first Madonna album not to feature a major hit single.  Anyway, this album was a disappointment for me.  Madonna can do much better than this, and I'm sure she will in the future.
B000002R48|5.0|When Dream & Day Unite(1989). Dream Theater's debut studio album.    Most fans already know the story of Dream Theater: how the band originally started as \\"Majesty\\" but had to change it at a later time due to another existing band already using the name, how it was formed by virtuoso musicians John Petrucci(guitars), Mike Portnoy(drums), Kevin Moore(keyboards), and John Myung(bass), and how the original vocalist Chris Collins makes this album's Charlie Dominici sound like Bruce Dickinson in comparison to him(trust me on this). So I won't divulge much on that.    The first thing I noticed when listening to all the albums again is how much each album doesn't sound like the ones before and after it, yet they still maintain the signature style DT is known for. The same applies with WD&DU. It certainly doesn't have the clean and polished sound that Images & Words(1992), Awake(1994), and any of their later albums have, and the band hasn't quite found their niche yet. Its low budget production quality may be to blame for the lack of a top-end treble and bass, but the decent remastering job does help this. There is a real rawness and a sense of \\"urgency\\" in the debut's sound that hasn't been prevalent since then, and for this you can tell that DT didn't take the music too seriously and just wanted to rock out. Though DT were certainly influenced by many different bands most of these influences hadn't surfaced quite yet, and so at this point DT carried a sound which resembled a mid-80s Rush with 70s Rush's songwriting style and Queensryche's metallic edge. The fact that Dominici sings much like a nasally Geddy Lee makes the band lean into this quality even more. James LaBrie hasn't come along yet and his range definitely outclasses Dominici's, but he still isn't bad at all.    Still, taken for what it is, this sound is definitely a GOOD thing in my book because I dig every era of Rush (Older Rush fans shouldn't slag off their 80s stuff because they don't seem to realize thatkeyboards have always played an important role in a fair amount of good progressive rock, but that's a story for another time... 'ahem' moving on..). Kevin Moore not only knows how to write outstanding songs and melodies, but his atmoshperic keyboard flourishes and solos are quite unique. And everyone knows about the excellent musicianship interplay between Moore, Petrucci, Portnoy, and Myung, so I won't go into that. WD&DU has its own unique \\"feel\\" generating from it and you can't really say that about a lot of music. Not only that, but the song compositions combining Rush and metal here were ahead of their time! Before their breakthrough I&W and Awake albums came along and spawned HUNDREDS of clone bands (not all good I'm afraid), there was hardly ANYONE doing this kind of stuff in the late 80s. Prog metal had Queensryche, Fates Warning, Crimson Glory, Voivod, and even some Justice-era Metallica to an extent, but I think Watchtower were the only other band that was making complex metal like this at the time.    'A Fortune In Lies' starts the debut off well, which is still a concert favorite to this day. By the end of the track, you have a clear picture on what DT is all about. 'Status Seeker' comes next and it's actually a personal favorite of mine, despite being underrated. Everyone who's seen DT live has heard the concert staple 'Ytse Jam' (that's \\"Majesty\\" backwards), which sports some stellar instrumental musicianship, and it never comes across as \\"wankery\\" which sadly the band is often accused of doing by non-fans. The best song on here has to be 'The Killing Hand', containing incredible buildup throughout its 8-minutes and is probably the closest thing to their songwriting mastery on the following few albums. There's some other overlooked material on here, such as the ever-changing 'Light Fuse And Get Away', the melodic 'Afterlife', and the dark and mystical sounding 'The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun'. 'Only A Matter Of Time' finishes on a strong note.    This album marks as a solid entry in the DT catalogue, yet a lot of their later material still surpasses it, so for new fans I would NOT start here. It certainly doesn't have the instant appeal that I&W, Awake, 6 Degrees Of Inner Turbulence(2002), or even the new album Octavarium(2005) contains. However, like a lot of DT's albums, its charm and genius opens up over time. Despite being remastered, there are NO bonus tracks on here! And I KNOW DT is fully loaded with unreleased material. In fact, they probably have twice as much of it as officially released stuff, so there's definitely a potential to make a massive b-side box set collection someday. Do make sure to check the debut out. No DT collection is complete without this one.    Other recommendations:  -Rush's \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" and Marillion's \\"Fugazi\\" (both are different prog rock, but contain a similar atmosphere to WD&DU).  -Any other DT album. ALL are worth hearing (despite what many ridiculously picky fans will tell you).  -Any of the last few Symphony X albums and Kamelot's new \\"The Black Halo\\" album.    (ALSO: If you really don't like Dominici's vocals, go to the ytsejamrecords site and get the bootleg \\"When Dream & Day Reunite\\", which is a 15 year celebration of DT's existence where they play the entire WD&DU album live with LaBrie at the helm and Rudess on keyboards.)
B000007OW1|5.0|It might be less polished but I enjoyed this Traviata much more than other famous recordings of this opera. It has an Italian bite that others lack.  <br /> <br />Devia's unique middle voice makes her stand out from other coloraturas who've tackled the role. It's in the second and third act where she really benefits from her gifted voice. She almost sounds like a mini Tebaldi! Act one of course presents no problems although she has hit better e-flats in her career, even recently. If the top note is what you're after however, it's there. The close microphones are also to blame for they don't provide the necessary space for the voices to bloom.  <br /> <br />Aronica is a tenor I haven't heard before (or since) but he makes a fine Alfredo. Vocally he reminds me of Tagliavini, Ramondi and Valetti without their more interesting phrasing though. Very pleasant Italian voice however. Germont isn't a role that requires much drama and this seems to suit the experienced Zancanaro well. We also get to hear the usually cut cabaletta (as well as other bars throughout the opera rarely heard!). Good, discreet support by maestro Callegari. If only the sound was a bit more spacious!  <br /> <br />I definitely join the praise of the previous' reviewers! If you'd appreciate pasta made at a local Italian restaurant more than by a posh international one, you'll love this Traviata!  <br />
B000000WA4|5.0|I first got into the Pumpkins in the early 1990's when I was in junior high and Siamese Dream came out.  I loved that album and was super excited to hear their next album would be a 2CD set.  This is the Pumpkins' masterpiece, in my opinion, followed very closely by Siamese Dream.  The 28 songs on this disc are super varied, from the majestic and beautiful Tonight,Tonight to the proto-metal of Where Boys Fear to Tread.  There is literally a bit of everything on here.  Zero and Bullet With Butterfly Wings are the most well known songs on here (and they straight-out rock even though Bullet has some cheesy lyrics) and 1979 is one of my favorite tunes.  I can remember cranking that song in the car with my buddies on summer nights out cruising for something to do....great song.  Some of the lesser known songs are just as great, such as Bodies, Tales of a Scorched Earth, and the absolutely majestic and soaring Here is No Why, probably my favorite song on the whole album.  I also really like Jellybelly, An Ode to No One, Thrity-Three, Muzzle, and X.Y.U.  In short, everything you've ever read about this being overrated and overblown are wrong.  It is over-the-top, but what great album isn't, to some extent?  Get this album, it's great!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|There is a riot going on in popular music right now, something called \\"New Folk\\" or \\"Neo-Folk.\\"  The practitioners don't really sound alike-- Animal Collective, Iron & Wine, Devendra Barnhardt, Stevens-- but together these artists comprise an important school of contemporary music: organic yet lush, in some cases challenging traditional song form, borrowing from the sounds of traditional folk and folk rock but assembling them in wholly new ways, and managing to avoid evoking James Taylor or Dylan or any of their forebears from before 1990.<br /><br />This album is a masterpiece of the genre (if Neo Folk is indeed a genre as opposed to a scene), and it is a true gem that will only get better with age.  You probably know Stevens intends to do an album about each of the 50 US states, and has already done one about Michigan.  Come On Feel the Illinoise is difficult to pigeonhole with \\"sounds like\\" comparisons-- acoiustic guitar, gentle vocals, quirky vocals, woodwinds, odd keyboard tones and off kilter rhythms drift in and out.  I'll try and define the epicenter of the sound by using these three points:  Brian Wilson's grander, more orchestral work; Joni Mitchell; and Phillip Glass.  But of course, that doesn't do the album, or the artist, justice.<br /><br />Illinoise is an album that demands to be heard in sequence, in its entirety.  Songs flow into one another, and the work is a singular one, not a bunch of songs assembled and released. You can play this in the background while doing something else; for friends at a social gathering; or on headphones while listening intently to every nuance.  It will reward in each setting.<br /><br />Indeed, this may not be the new folk at all.  It is so grand, so shimmering, so compelling, that it may just be the new classical music.

B0009S4IHY|4.0|What do you get if you blend a Jackie Chan movie, a Warner Brothers cartoon, the Matrix's wire work, some odd dance numbers involving men carrying axes, and a huge cast of Chinese martial artist actors?  I don't know, but it probably looks a lot like Kung Fu Hustle.<br /><br />If you're reading the above, you're probably figuring this sounds pretty lame.  In a way, it is.  But the entire movie is executed in such a way that you almost don't care that there's no story.  There is a ton of action, in the form of kung fu fights and Matrix-style wire work that lends a \\"much larger than life\\" aspect to it all.  There is quite a lot of humor (some of it perhaps unintentional) in the less-than-stellar acting, the Warner Brothers cartoon-style chase scene between the landlady and the young con artist, some great effects of \\"nearly invisible\\" flying knives, and some dance numbers that seem a bit out of place but somehow just \\"work\\" in the movie.<br /><br />I found myself laughing out loud at several parts, and finding it very hard to take my eyes off the screen (kind of like that natural need to look at a train wreck).<br /><br />I'm not sure I can explain why, but I think this may be one of the coolest and most interesting movies I've ever seen.  It's campy in places, flat-out weird in places, plain silly at times, and yet somehow it all works and becomes a true work of art.  My advice for someone watching this for the first time is to pretend it's a cartoon from overseas, played with live human actors.  This should put you in the right frame of mind to enjoy it.  Don't look for character development, a fleshed-out plot, or for parts of it to make any sense at all.  Just enjoy it.<br /><br />I had such an incredibly good time watching this that I have to give it about an 8.5 out of 10 (where 10 is excellent).  I'd rented it from Netflix, but I think I'll be buying it after I send it back.  It's that entertaining...
068987474X|4.0|It took me three days to read this book, simply because it was giving it to me straight.  Hilarious and it makes tons of common sense and helps you (man or woman) see things as they are... nothing more, no fillers of any kind.

Kind of a funny and rewarding sense of stupidity of oneself... don't know how many times I hit myself in the forhead. <br /> <br />Great insight that can truly help keep you from wasting time on the wrong person or situation.  In other words, VALUE THYSELF! <br /> <br />Fun read with lots to learn. <br /> <br />
B0000AUHPG|3.0|Jason Robards was the best character in here.  The woman should of been shot though.  Tramping around with the man that murdered her family.  I did not get the ending, what? was the woman longing for bronson? the next man to sucker.  Was harmonica too dumb to see her tramping ways.  Sadly the directors did not play more on this.  Happily Robards is seemingly the smarter of the bunch at this point in the movie, however he was much too gentle with her at the end.  They should of kicked her off the land and tried her for cavorting with criminals.    <br />The harmonica is WAY over done and the movie is too long.  Not enough character display by Robards and or Fonda. The murdering at the beginning was apparently unjust and unbelievable.  You are left feeling confused why the tramp keeps the land.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|..Unless you like craptastic movies  Clint Eastwood has said that if you're an actor, and you can't get the scene right on the second take, then you have no bizness being an actor, ie:(in one of his movies). This explains how the actors turn the characters into charactertures of human beings, by exhibiting over the top method acting. Warning! Ugly, inhuman, inexplicable final scenes. OK, explained by the fact that Ole Clint directed them just for the \\"shock value\\" DUH! To top it off...big old lettering at the end...\\"Music by Clint Eastwood\\". Making Clint a total legend in his own mind and in the minds of his adoring fans, who say he can do nothing wrong! He isn't a composer, and not much a director either.
B00003CXDG|2.0|Boy was I disappointed with this film.  While the first one was a wonderfully dense and relatively believable tale that could be viewed over and over for that little extra detail, this sequel just makes a one-dimensional superhero of Cruise.  You can't suspend your disbelief with this one as the plot is outlandish and Cruise can't do all the things that his character does.  There is no psychological depth, right down to the chick he conquers who also happens to be an integral part of the plot.<br /><br />Recommended as throw-away entertainment only.
B000002GB4|3.0|Styx has always been a guilty pleasure for me (I own 10 of their CDs). While others hear sappy arena rock love songs covered with lush synthesizers, and what some people claim epitomized the term \\"cheesy\\", I simply hear magic. Styx does not get the credit they deserve most of the time. \\"Crystal Ball\\" is a fine example of the brand of album rock these guys were all about. Styx has one of the more enjoyable catalogs of music as far as the mid to late 70s go, and \\"Crystal Ball\\" is the album that kicked it all off.<br /><br />The 7-minute epic \\"Clair de Lune / Ballerina\\" is worth the price of admission alone. This album was a tremendous leap above \\"Equinox\\" (their previous LP), and even a bigger step above the 4 albums that came before that. It showcases their skills much more than it's predecessors, which they would prove to improve upon throughout a string of 4 (big) hit albums to follow. \\"Crystal Ball\\" is the big one in the bunch, which reaches the heights of their later superior work. \\"Put Me On\\" serves as a hard rocking intro, but turns out to be one of the most soothing ballads towards the end. There is a lot of variety, lots of time changes and a lot of exercising in genres. DeYoung's \\"Jennifer\\" has always been an overlooked gem.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely one of the best albums in Styx's discography. But if you're looking for their best, I would recommend \\"The Grand Illusion\\", or \\"Pieces of Eight\\". Some will tell you that \\"Cornerstone\\" is just as good; and they may be right. Give credit where credit is due. Styx blended pop with progressive rock beautifully. Which resulted in some of the best album rock of the 70s.
0312995423|1.0|Has Mr. Brown ever been to Spain??? <br /> <br />First, based on Mr. Browns description of Spain I thought the book was plot in the late 30s... But when I realised he was menting mid 90s Spain... Well, I don't have words for such an outrage... <br /> <br />I think Mr. Brown should research more thoroughly before insulting a whole nation this way. <br /> <br />
1570422052|2.0|Ok, so I saw the DVD first, read the book book second, and then downloaded the abridged version thru iTunes. I definately recommend reading the book first, watching the DVD second, and then hearing the audiobook last. The audiobook starts with Morgaine being brought to Avalon. It completely leaves out the whole part of Igraine and Golois and then Igraine and Uther. This audiobook is a bit of a disappointment. I would definately consider buying the unabridged version of this (if they made it).
0440241413|5.0|As a person who is very particular about what I read, I can honestly say that Confessions of a Shopaholic is one of my favorites. I'm not a fan of British literature, but Sophie Kinsella is an amazingly hilarious author. This is the second book of hers that I have read, and I recommend the entire series, as well as Can You Keep A Secret, to anyone who enjoys reading a good comedy. It's great to read a story whose major issue isn't something dealing with violence, drugs, alcohol, or sex and is still completely realistic. The main character is loveable, though a little crazy, and any shopaholic can relate to her.
B000003TA4|1.0|\\"\\"A person insults Pearl Jam and a person gets mad. Some people need to grow up. If a person doesn't like pearl jam, they can say so. It's their opinion\\" <br /> <br />And if a person doesn't like Nirvana, they can just aswell state their opinion. Don't be such an idiot and a hypocrite. Grow up.  <br /> <br />As for the Pearl Jam fan, I agree with him. If you think Nirvana is anywhere near Pearl Jam, you have bad taste in music.
B00006IUL6|5.0|Christopher Nolan's \\"Insomnia\\" is a fantastic film, that manages to top the original. This police thriller is hypnoticly enthralling from beginning to end. Al Pacino has one of his best roles in years.(He's still the man!) Robin Williams was better in \\"One Hour Photo\\", but he's not glaringly miscast as others claim.The rest of the cast is first-rate, with Hillary Swank being particularly good. The credit for this film's greatness belongs to Director Nolan. He's created a tense,visually unique picture that transcends genre cliches, and stands as one of the best movies of the decade.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|First let me begin by saying that I am not the 12 years old kid that thinks TOT was great nu-metal material nor the old DT fan that is still expecting another Awake or Images and Words album from DT <br /> <br />TOT was awful, in fact I gave away my cd after a few days. But Octavarium is good, not the best DT album but in fact one of the best, how good it is??? Well everyone is different, but here is my Dream Theater ranking: <br /> <br />1)Images and Words <br />2) FII <br />3)Awake <br />4)Octavarium <br />5)Six degrees, change of seasons and Scenes <br />6)When dream and day unite <br />9999) TOT <br /> <br />So, IMO give it try, in fact I wasn't expecting a big deal after TOT, but I guess DT is back from the grave.
B000001E18|1.0|Ever notice the 'helpful' votes lean to 'no' most often when a review is a pan?   <br />I have much respect for the reviewer from Sydney; though many tout this U2 clunker to be terrific, he's the only one bold enough to give it 5 stars--misguided though he is.... <br />Going in a new direction is not synonymous with improving.  That U2 continued to lose their way by proffering new sounds to ever-restless fans is proof that they had run out of their greatest asset: songs of faith.   Now, faith is hard to hold onto, no doubt; but since this album (and the previous ACHTUNG), they haven't re-found their souls, try as they might to make spiritual statements.  \\"We were just ACTING the rock star persona, wink-wink.\\"  A recent mild return to their greatness is promising, but likely you will never hear an album like WAR again.  Remember Neil Young's awful 80's?  He came out on the other side with SILVER AND GOLD.  Remember Dylan's 80's?  He rose like a phoenix with LOVE AND THEFT.  Unbelieveable, really.  But U2 haven't yet hosed the stink quite off of themselves.

B00000IL26|5.0|Why should you even bother with Lee Morgan's \\"The Sidewinder?\\"  The reasons are plenty.  Because it's one of the finer releases on the esteemed Blue Note label.  Because it's one of the trumpeter's best albums.  Because you, the listener, will get to witness the awesome interplay between Morgan, saxophonist Joe Henderson, pianist Barry Harris, bass player Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Billy Higgins.  Because it's a one-of-a-kind album that belongs in any serious jazz lover's collection.  Check out the second track \\"Totem Pole,\\" in which Morgan gives each of his members a chance to shine.  Harris's great piano solo and Henderson's saxophone compliment Morgan's trumpet like butter on a hot biscuit.  \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" like the rest of the album, is a great uptempo number that will have anyone within earshot tapping their toes to the steady beat of Higgin's drum, supported by Morgan on trumpet and Henderson on sax.  This album was originally released in 1963 but was remastered 35 years later by Rudy Van Gelder.  Thanks to Van Gelder, the recording sounds notably crisp and vibrant, with the music projecting with a certain force that was meant to be experienced.  Morgan's catalogue is full of winners, but if you have to start with one album, many would agree that \\"The Sidewinder\\" is the one to get.
B0009P42S2|4.0|Veredicto: Soberbia!  <br /> <br />As es amigos, es una de las mejores pelculas animadas que he visto en mucho tiempo.  <br /> <br />Las razones:  <br /> <br />Steamboy, es una historia pelcula llena de accin y aventura; con una presentacion (diseo de personajes y ambientes) que supera las expectativas del ms exigente; adems, nos regala un sonido impecable, desde sus efectos hasta la banda sonora.  <br /> <br />Lo bueno:  <br /> <br />En Steamboy, uno puede poner pausa y sentir que en cada cuadro se contiene una obra de arte, despierta en nosotros una gran admiracin por el minuciosos y apasionado trabajo del equipo de produccin, quienes se comprometieron mas all de la norma y llenaron esta cinta de una vida y magia pocas veces alcanzaa en una cinta animada. <br /> <br />Lo malo:  <br /> <br />Si bien la histora es buena y tiene una buena carga de emociones accin y suspenso, me paece que la premisa fundamental que est en disputa  y que motiva el actuar de los personajes (sobre el ideal del uso de la tecnologa)es poco profunda y carece de fuerza. Esto para m es la nica queja, es el punto que le resta esa estrella de la perfeccin. <br /> <br />Lo nuevo:  <br /> <br />Una historia original y personajes realistas que son ms creibles que la mayora de los protagonistas de pelculas animadas debido a que no ecajan en los paradigmas tpicos del \\"Malo y el Bueno\\", sino que se perciben como seres humanos con distintas motivaciones, conflictos y deseos. <br /> <br />Cmprala si: <br /> <br />Quieres agregar un nuevo clsico a tu coleccin y quieres ver los que es llevar a la animacin a los umbrales del arte. <br /> <br />No la compres s: <br /> <br />Si estas buscando una pelcula para regalar a alguien menor a 10 u 11 aos. <br /> <br />En Resumen: Steamboy nos presenta un concepto redondo y original que quita el aliento a cualquiera, no slo de quienes gustan del anime. Un clsico instantaneo para adolescentes y adultos que no debe de faltar en la coleccin de ningn amante de la animacin. <br />
B000ANVQAA|5.0|I am so glad that this movie has got the special treatment it deserves after 7 years of waiting.  For a $200 million movie that could have easily been a flop, it managed to make $1.8 billion dollars in cinema and video sales, making this the BIGGEST movie of all time, because it touched so many people's feelings.  And, for all the people out there who say \\"oh, I detest this movie\\", or \\"it sailed, it sank, get over it!\\", think again of the amount of money it made, and the amount of people it touched. <br />Also, I'll be getting the 4-DISC version, because I'm from Britain.  So HA HA HA to the Americans and Canadians!

0385338686|3.0|I am a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's books.  Prior to this book, I had read all of the 'Confessions' books and 'Can You Keep A Secret' and I honestly loved them all.  Unfortunately, I just didn't feel consumed by this book like I have the others.  I did enjoy the plot & it certainly had me laughing out loud at some points but I just didn't feel it... if that makes any sense.  The good news is, I would still recommend it because everyone truly has different tastes in books and I am sure that there are people who will love it more than I did and hate it more than I did.  So, take a chance and read it.
B00009Z576|1.0|... you know that keyboard fade-in that kicks off track 3's rideout?  Well, when this track was remastered, the fade-in was not preserved.  Keyboards just kick in at full volume, thus ruining the intended gradual build up to the bass-driven rideout.  Other than this oversight, which knocks my rating of this edition to 1 star, the musical experience of Drama remains among my favorite of Yes.  Keep the Atlantic remaster if you've got it, or get this if you can tolerate the remastering error.  P.S., bonus tracks are inconsequential IMHO.  The Anderson tracks underscore the fact that Yes was due for a change in musical direction.  Enter the Buggles...
B0000025DV|5.0|It's been at least 25 years since I last listened to this wonderful album; suddenly I was singing all the words like I was still in high school.  Truly a timeless work - how Jeff Lynn and ELO have been ignored over the years is truly an enigma.  If it's been a while since you're really smiled freely, a few moments with this treasure will be more than the trick you need.  A must-have for any collection.
0440237688|2.0|This is one of the required books that have to be read over the kids summer vacation. I'm the parent and found it very interesting, but the children that I've talked to; >20 have found it very dry.  <br />Have your kids read it with plenty of water <br />
B0007M22TI|1.0|I saw this on PBS. This is so blatantly lip-synched. I guess I don't get the appeal of this. It is like a really elaborate cover-band. So, what I can gather about these \\"talented\\" women is:<br /><br />1. They don't write their own music;<br />2. They don't move on stage(except the violin lady but she also was not actually playing live!);<br />3. They don't sing.<br /><br />Wow. Really talented. When people accept things like this, go to the concerts, buy the CD's and DVD's, it just sends a message to the industry that a farce like this is O.K. and they will do it again and again, create these mock performances. It just brings everything down a notch every time something like this is successful. People need to be more critical of their entertainment. Remember when lip-synched concerts were first exposed? People were up in arms, demanding their money back, there was even talk of new laws so there would be full disclosure if a concert was using lip-synching! Slowly though, it's become accepted and no one utters a peep.<br /><br />Disgusting.
0805047905|5.0|This has been our little ones favorite book since birth.  We read it almost every day.  And each time, he sits and looks at the pictures, studies each animal and seems so interested.<br /><br />This along with Polar Bear Polar Bear are my 2 must have books.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|\\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" allows us to see what happens in a year in the life of Xavier (Romain Duris), a young man from France who has been promised a job in the French bureaucracy if he is fluent in Spanish. Thus, he applies to the Erasmus programme, in order to study in Barcelona (Spain) for a year.<br /><br />Xavier leaves his parents and his girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou) behind, but he meets lots of new people and survives to cultural shock. He also starts an affair with the lonely wife of another Frenchman, and goes to Economy classes at the university. But what will charm the viewer is the chaotic life Xavier will have in the apartment he will share with other foreign students. In a way, the apartment is a little piece of the European Union, with people from Italy, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Spain and France. Of course, there are lots of linguistic misunderstandings, but also an enormous amount of amusing situations and good-natured fun.<br /><br />I specially appreciated the fact that the scriptwriter and the director (Cedric Klapisch) managed to convey many of the phases a foreign student goes through. For example, when Xavier says that \\"When you first arrive in a new city, nothing makes sense\\", but \\"After you've lived here, walked these streets, you'll know them inside out. You'll know these people. Once you've lived here, crossed this street 10, 20, 1000 times... it'll belong to you because you've lived there\\".<br /><br />At the end, Xavier learns Spanish, but also about friendships, relationships and himself. In a way, watching this movie will allow you to be \\"there\\" with him throughout the whole process. And truth to be told, that is many things but never boring. Give this movie a try, I promise it is fun  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B0001IN07Q|5.0|What a package!  The CD is great and it offers a chance to compare studio versions with the DVD live versions of the same songs.  Mega bonus here....the DVD has three of the \\"sessions@AOL\\" songs! \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" will break your heart! <br /> <br />The DVD has one flaw which makes it appear that it was edited by someone on a really strange acid trip!  The constant cut aways from Michael singing on stage are a bit annoying but many of the cuts go straight to footage of Michael talking about many different aspects of his life and they are quite interesting.  The main fault is that when you do see Michael singing in concert, the cuts, superimpositions and the speed with which they are carried out left me with the distinct feeling that the producer/director/editor of the film footage did not feel that a straight-on shot of Michael could hold a Bubl fan's attention for more than three seconds.  Proof positive that they didn't know squat about Michael's fans and also that they should never be allowed to work on a video project concerning Michael ever again.  Fortunately the up close and personal shots of Michael talking about his life/career provide some redemption for the psychedelics of the editing. <br /> <br />It's beautifully packaged and on the inside, it has the famous photo of Michael showing off two buttons worth of his chest and it's 5X5!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I initially had heard of Coldplay prior to the American release of \\"Parachutes\\" because at the time I was infatuated with Radiohead and was consistently hearing Coldplay mentioned alongside them by the British music press (a comparison that I have never quite understood).  I bought \\"Parachutes\\" upon it's US release and was pleasantly surprised by what I found, an atmospheric, if not sometimes subdued, collection of beautiful songs.  I could never have envisioned that Colplay would ascend to such great heights in the coming years. <br />   When I first purchased X&Y, I knew immediately that I liked the album, but was unable to gauge how much.  The album has a ton of material on it, and at first it seemed a bit overwealming to process all of it.  But after a couple of weeks, I realized that I was listening to one of the best albums I had ever heard.  The music is so much more ambitious and grandiose than that of which is featured on the previous two albums.  It also has a more powerful, almost menacing, quality to it that had previously been missing.  It seems to me that whenever I purchase a new album from a band I respect, I am either dissapointed or merely contented by an average effort.  So often it seems that a particular musical artists' best years are behind them.  This is NOT the case here.  Coldplay are at the height of their game and charting territory rarely acheived by the vast majority of musical groups.  An extraordinary effort!
6304602944|5.0|I found this film 2 be quite enjoyable.Its clear that the writers were influenced by the success of Lethal Weapon as it is clearly evident in this film.I am very suprised that no sequels were ever made as I thought they could have made at least 1 more.Stallone was good in this picture but I thought Kurt Russell stole the show as Cash.Also Teri Hatcher was Good in this film also.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I find it very surprising that of all the lawyers praising this film, non of them know or if they know, never mention the fact that John Voelker AKA Robert Traver was a lawyer himself. As a matter of fact, he graduated from the University of Michigan law school supporting himself as a waiter through school, was prosecutor for Marquette County where this murder actually happened and he prosecuted this case. He went on to be appointed a Michigan supreme court justice in 1957 by  Govenor G. Mennen aka\\"Soapy\\" Williams and was re-elected. During that time he wrote the book \\"The Anatomy of a Murder\\" which was a feature  on the Book of the Month club selection. NO WONDER the guy knew how to write court room drama so realistically. This is a great film, its fun to see my mother's home town of Ishpeming which is where John Voelker actually lived, and cool to see the beautiful Marquette court house. But...I have to agree that Duke Ellington seems a little out of place if anyone is familiar with the demographics of the UP of Michigan. Love his music and him, though.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Bubl has enough written about his incredible ability to take older gems and make them his very own. Other reviews speak eloquently and truthfully on his behalf; the young man has everything it takes and more.  He also has the *&^%!! to take some not so old songs and make them gems, simply by the beauty he infuses into them.  Michael....please tell me that you chose the songs and not the A & R staff!! <br /> <br />The only song which gets totally messed up is Quando, Quando, Quando.  I was in heaven listening to Michael sing the intro; it was truly great until the first two words came out of Nellie's mouth! Like an electrical jolt, the song was pulled out from under Michael's feet and it was no longer his!  I don't think that duets will ever work well for someone with a voice like his.  With that said, his rendition of \\"You Don't Know Me\\" holds up to any version I have heard and loved over the years.  Seeing \\"(A)Song For You\\" on the track list made me nervous because my opinion is that Barbara Cook owns that beautiful Leon Russell song! Once again, a new rendition that can stand proudly, side by side, with Cook's heart wrenching version! <br /> <br />However,one song in particular on this CD which blows everything else into the background is Michael's very own, \\"Home\\"; (he does take credit for writing the complete lyrics in one of his interviews).  It upstages everything on the CD.  If you haven't seen the partial music video on his web page or the full live version on his AOL-sessions page, check it out.  Thankfully the song was included on this disk but to see him sing it in two different video formats brings a whole new dimension to the pathos and the pain he expresses from his heart. I can't wait till he introduces more of his own compositions into his upcoming releases if a song so beautiful as \\"Home\\" was lurking in his heart!  Michael has said in his DVD release that he has never lied in his entire life and \\"Home\\" takes the stand to bear witness to thefact! <br /> <br />Aside from the music, the CD insert has some extremely beautiful and sensual photos of a man who could make the hottest looking Armani models run for shelter!  Oh grow up, already, you music purists!  Do you think that if Michael still had his voice but looked like Andy Griffith that tens of thousands of screaming young fans would stand in line at his various venues, just hoping to touch him or get a kiss (something he frequently does)?  Let's face it, he's a 10++ and if you've got it Michael, flaunt it!
B00049QQHI|3.0|I wouldn't have sit through the entire movie if the story lacked but eventually, after it's shady opening, narrated by DiCaprio's character, i became interested in the actual plot of the downfall of the protagonist. The better scenes in this movie involves the induction of supporting cast Mark Wahlberg, who makes the movie even more realistic and hard-hitting. It's a simple story of a frustrated adolesent taking drugs in prep-school suffering the torments of phedos such as the Coach and his teacher.<br /><br />The movie overall was entertaining but leaves you wondering at the end where does the character go from now and where are the other prominent characters of the story. If you like drama based on true stories and actual happenings of teen life, pick up Basketball Diaries.
0884271153|3.0|In this other classic from Eli Goldratt you will see how some of the thinking processes are used to resolve business issues but also to address some personal matters.  The book is not a `how to' of thinking processes and it will not provide you with the necessary guidelines to start creating your own trees and evaporating clouds.  It will however provide examples of the contexts in which they can be used.  The general story line of the book is also interesting and makes for a pleasant read.
0316172324|4.0|Although the Author does not use these exact words, the book is all about how your Intuition, Sixth sense or \\"thin slicing\\" (as the author puts it) plays important role in our day to day snap decisions and also about how to guard against mis-reading your Intution. <br /> <br />The author enumerates this power with numerous examples ... for example ... how some experts can tell whether the marriage will survive based on just few minutes of interactions between the pairs ... how some folks can tell whether double fault is going to occur by just observing the beginning of the serve ... how some folks were able to tell that a statue was fake by just one brief glance.  <br /> <br />Additionally, the author enumerates different examples where \\"thin slicing\\" fails. He analyses and presents information which can help one from getting into the trap. <br /> <br />At times the chapter gets long and obvious, in such situations once you get the essence of the subject, you may want to just skim over some of the chapters . <br /> <br />Overall my take away was ... in times of quick action, do try to listen to what your gut tells. Don't totally rely on noise or so called facts that are being bombarded at you. <br /> <br />Definitely worth reading ... at least once :-) <br /> <br />-Sachin

1558216847|5.0|This was one of the most captivating books I have ever read.  Is it true?  I don't really care.  If you're like me you at least understand about the human ability to push beyond its normal limits.  Reading the words of this book tells you that this person experienced something that pushed his human endurance level way beyond the common man or woman.  Whether the stories are EXACTLY true or not is really irrelevant.  The soul of his story is stirring and encouraging.  I suppose in a hundred years there will be some that will scoff at the Aaron Ralston story (self arm amputation).  Some may doubt his story even today with all the evidence that is available.  But regardless, what was the soul of his story?  In both cases, human endurance can be surprisingly resilient and seemingly super-human when the desire for freedom and to live is strong.  I'd encourage anyone to read this story.  You will remember AND apply its lessons in human endurance for years to come.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This treasure chest of musical gems is entitled It's Time and I have to say it is impressive.

B000056N8X|3.0|Ok they did a pretty decent job of bringing the movie Highlander back together with TV Highlander.  The two met for the initial episode of the TV series but that was it.  Also they did a great job of erasing Highlander 2 and 3 from existence.    The storyline isn't too bad.  Connor has basically given up on life and has entered into a Watchers' sanctuary.  This was designed by them so there would never be only one.  Connor's past catches up on him and the sanctuary is no more.  Duncan pursues Connor's disappearance and finds himself wrapped up in the same problem.  Together they must fight an immortal that is much stronger than either of them.    As Highlander fans you need to be a little forgiving for this movie to work.  It definitely leaves the door open to future sequels as well.  My major beef with this movie is they make Connor look old, I mean really old.  You can argue his worries make him look old but I don't buy it.  They did nothing to counteract the natural human aging process, and in fact purposely made him look older.  Christopher Lambert does not naturally look as old as they make him appear in this movie. I could have given this a 4 but the age thing bothered me too much.
B000002HMH|4.0|You read it right.  Honestly, after all of these years, Load is the only Metallica album I still listen to.  Growing up I loved Master of Puppets and especially Ride the Lightning.  And Justice was a damn good album too (not as good as its predecessors though)  Then something happened.  Metallica released the Black Album, and to me THAT was the end of Metallica as I knew them.  I couldn't stand it, and wondered what happened.  A few years later, I was over the fact that they would never be that 80's band again, and Load came out.  I absolutely love it.  Ain't My Bitch, Bleeding Me, Until It Sleeps, Mama Said, and my favorite song of the 90's, Hero of the Day are absolutely incredible.  Just listen to the album, and try to forget that it's the same guys who made those prior albums.  For God's sake, that's what they wanted you to do (the haircuts and suits were the beginning of a new era my friends).  Great album that would unfortunately be their last.
0312263120|1.0|well, i really admire this author, i have read all his books so far and he seemed to have good sources and investigate at least a lil bit before he started writing. but hey, i come from spain, and i think this guy has never been to spain!!!! thanks so much for making my country look like an undeveloped country where all the hospitals are dirty and many other things i dont even want to reproduce. he even says \\"this isnt america, here there are no rules\\". I know it is fiction but MAN!!!! it is no good when you make fiction out of real places and make them look like that. And the worse thing is that i dont even think he believes it fiction, he probably thinks we are like that in spain, i feel sorry about his ignorance, and I hope he gets the opportunity to come to spain and see how wonderful and well developed this country is. please dan, dont insult a whole nation like that, you should apologize. BOYCOTT DAN BROWN IN SPAIN!!!!!
B00005RYL2|5.0|Everyone has there favorite movie and this one is mine.  This is a cult classic that some love and others hate.  It has everything one could want; sex, romance, martial arts, swordplay, history (well not quite), mystery, and beheadings.  Christopher Lambert is at his best in this film.  Sean Connery's limited appearance is a great asset as well. <br /> <br />The basic storyline is there are immortals that take other immortals power and lives by cutting off their heads.  Eventually there can be only one and that one will have the prize.   <br />
B00005JNJT|5.0|When Marvel comic books begin, their intro before the opening credits is a montage of images similar to those found in their colourful comic books. Marvel have had this intro since `Spider-Man'.<br /><br />Now with a resurgence of interest, if somewhat forced interest in<br /><br />Batman, DC Comics has a similar opening title. The previous, later four Batman films do not.<br /><br />I also feel `Batman Begins' is trying to add more to a story<br /><br />that does not need much if any back story. For instance there is no Rachel character portrayed by Katie Holmes. So here I think they are trying to give Batman a love interest and he didn't originally have one. I see `Spider-Man' again in the characters of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. Don't get me wrong I LOVE stories like this between childhood sweethearts, but here I don't think it really worked.<br /><br />I only saw this movie for Katie, who I enjoyed since I enjoy her<br /><br />other films. In this she is like a different actress. I was VERY<br /><br />impressed! I have seen all Katie's films except `Pieces of<br /><br />April', and `First Daughter'. I'm sure to see these movies one<br /><br />day. I am currently watching her grow up in `Dawson's Creek'. Like watching Ronny Howard transform before our eyes on `The Andy Griffith Show' and `Happy Days', I enjoy watching young actors grow up, and see where they go.<br /><br />I can relate more to Marvel Comics. Their heroes and villains exist in a world not unlike our own. While Gotham City exists only in one's mind. I can't really relate. It's not real. Sometimes it helps to be real sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />`Batman Begins' villain is `Scarecrow'. He feeds on<br /><br />the fear of the public and the fear of Batman. For Marvel fans think of `Daredevil's dilemma. He is sometimes called `The Man Without Fear'.<br /><br />I enjoy the other Batman films. I particularly like `Batman<br /><br />Forever' and `Batman & Robin'. They don't take themselves too<br /><br />seriously, and are funny. `Batman Begins' is a much darker film like Tim Burton's interpretation, but different. Instead `Batman Begins' adds credit to `Batman' with a Joker card and Batman's line \\"I'll look into it\\".<br /><br />There is a totally huge list of famous celebrities for this<br /><br />instalment of `Batman Begins'. Christian Bale (American<br /><br />Psycho) doesn't do much for me. Neither does Michael Caine but he suits the part of Alfred. The whole cast is impressive. I also was impressed with Christopher Nolan's direction. I was glad he was director because I had seen his previous film, `Insomnia', with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank and loved it.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw this movie. I love the image of Katie Holmes lying<br /><br />limp in Batman's arms. It really is quite beautiful to me.<br /><br />I'm sure this film will not disappoint fans of the comic books or<br /><br />previous films. No one has to go through dark times alone. I know Batman is a hero for many young children so all the more power to you all. Everyone was a child at some point in their life. I think it is important to never loose that child like sensibility. So no matter what you do when you're young keep it fun! You'll grow up before you know it!ny. `Batman Begins' is a much darker film like Tim Burton's interpretation, but different.

0553260111|4.0|I know what you must be saying. \\"What's a book review doing up here?\\". Well, sometimes you need a little change of pace. About a year ago my brother recomended the Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum . Mind you, I'm not what you call an avid reader. I seldom get past the first two chapters of something before I put it down and forget about it (you can thank the New Haven public schools and Ethan Frome for that). But the Bourne Identity was one of those rare instances that I thoroughly enjoyed a book from start to finish. Like I always say, if someone had recomended a book like this when I was younger maybe I'd be a better reader today.  <br /> <br />Jason Bourne is a man without a past. Washed up on the French coast near death he is found by a doctor and treated for his wounds. He makes a full recovery save for one part, his memory. His past shrouded in mystery may be a secret too dangerous for him to discover.  <br /> <br />The Bourne Identity is a great piece of probably what you'd call spy fiction. Mr. Ludlum's writing style is not only easy to read but it doesn't get bogged down in too many tedious and extraneous details. Everything is described using easily relatable terms. The thing I've always hated about reading was a writer's inability to get to the point of a chapter. Ludlum not only delivers but he also keeps you on your toes. He keeps the story compelling and moving, often at a break-neck pace. The action stays fast but not overwhelming at times. The story was full of twists in just about each chapter. New revelations abound. It's style of writing that made the book not only enjoyable, but practically a pleasure to read. At over 530 pages, the book doesn't feel like it's long and drawn out. Though there are times where the action was slow it wasn't without purpose. Almost providing a respite during a storm.  <br /> <br />One of the things I liked about the story was the chess match between Bourne and Carlos. Though Bourne had no memory of who he was or whathe was, he often reacted on instinct alone. Each manuevering, trying to out-do each other until the final climax. And when the end comes it was well worth the wait.  <br /> <br />This is only my second review of a book, and it's a book that I actually liked. Having not seen the movie version and not being able to state the differences I'm not sure on how to end other than saying that if you like a fast paced story that won't become tiresome, then I highly recomend the Bourne Identity.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|When you buy the soundtrack to a musical, it's reasonable to expect that you'll be getting the songs that were in the musical as they were?  I think so!  Well, you get this here...sort of.  Some of the songs that we all love are there, and others aren't.  Instead they're replaced by stupid pop songs.  You can get all the songs as they were (more or less) in the movie, BUT <br /> <br />you have to buy the second CD!  What a ploy!  I was mightily upset by this.  If you like pop versions and remixes, then the CD(s) will probably be worth your money, but if you want the original songs, you can probably save money by buying them off the iMusic store.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|When I first heard Muse's \\"Apocalypse Please,\\" I thought It was Radiohead. That is how much Muse sounds like them. With a more careful ear, they are a little different in many ways. You can hear classical influences especially on Blackout, Butterflies & Huricanes (my personal favorite cut) and Sing For Absolution. Muse also takes a little bit more of an agressive approach to their music, giving Radiohead's Britpop more of an edge. Some tracks lean more toward an Industrial Metal type genre (Time is Running Out, Stockholm Syndrome). Matthew Bellamy's vocals are outstanding. His falsetto is amazing and he interprets the musical lines similar to Yorke but still puts his own little twist on the interpretation. All of the songwriting is very mature, you won't hear much of anything else like it. Bellamy's lyrics are breathtaking, poetic and intriguing. How many other songs have you heard that use the word \\"asphyxiated?\\" In short, Muse is more than a darker version of Radiohead. They are a very original, fresh and evocative group of musicians that are not afraid to push the limits of modern musicianship. The production on the album is flawless, giving the wall of sound a whole new name. An amazing effort, I can't wait to see what they put out next.
B000000OQF|1.0|Reality check. <br /> <br />The Velvet Underground's first album was released in 1967 - This album inspired everyone from David Bowie to the Clash to start playing music, and has proven to be much more influential than Appetite For Destruction. <br /> <br />And if you think Appetite for Destruction is the best debut album of the last 20 years... <br /> <br />Reality check. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam's 'Ten' was released in 1991 - Is almost every band on the radio trying to sound like Pearl Jam? (creed; nickelback; default, etc..) or Guns N Roses? Exactly... <br /> <br />Best debut album of all time?  Not even close.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Okay, I understand some people don't like the hits from the Beatles and are more into the album tracks, but still, this album does EXACTLY what it says. It gets their 27 number one hits in the U.S. and the U.K. and puts them on one disc. What is to not like about that? The disc is in chronological order, so it starts with \\"Love Me Do\\" and ends with \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", their last number one. It shows their progression from teen pop idols to musical artists who tried new things. All the Beatles music is great in one way or another, and for the casual Beatles fan, this is a good way to get all the hits on one disc at a great price.
B000001FOS|5.0|I can still remember the first time I listened to Malmsteen. <br />It was the \\"Odyssey\\" album back in the summer of 1988. <br />It was a life-changing experience. I put the cassette tape on the player and pressed \\"PLAY\\". After 3 minutes of listening to the \\"Rising Force\\" track, my jaw had fallen on the floor. I had never heard any kind of guitar playing, like this before. <br />The arpeggios on this very first track were coming out of hell, executed with devilish virtuosity and unbelievable speed. <br /> <br />I can still remember the first time I listened to Malmsteen.  <br />The same night I was not able to fall asleep. My mind was flooded with millions of notes, scales, arpeggios, and guitar riffs played at an out-of-this-world speed. The effect was permanent. I became a fan of the most technical & most innovative metal guitar player of the world. <br /> <br />My opinion about \\"Odyssey\\": catchy & commercial, yes, classic & powerful yet. Stands the test of time. A blend of good song writing and impressive guitar acrobatics. A nice introduction in Malmsteen music. <br /> <br />I can still remember the first time I listened to Malmsteen.
B00001ZULV|5.0|This Genesis compilation has a great selection of music, 90% of it  post Peter Gabriel, hence the name \\"hits\\". However, two songs from the Peter Gabriel-led era, where the sound wasn't polished, slick pop/rock but complex progressive/art rock, are included in the reaggae like \\"I Know What I Like In Your Wardrobe\\" and the mystical, mythical \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\". Also included is \\"Congo\\", a single created after vocalist/drummer Phil Collins left the band in 1993. A great selection of music, and I like the shorter versions of the longer songs, as after a while the music becomes a little too much. If you like the Top 40 era of Genesis, pick up this album. Those who like the progressive/art rock era will be disappointed besides the two Gabriel cuts that made the playlist.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is proabably close to my favorite film I've ever seen.  It's just spendidly done and very well crafted, you just lose yourself in the film from open to close.  It also gets credit for being one of the only films (next to 'mystic river') that follows the novel so well.  I hate watching films that distract from the message of the novel by changing the story line so drastically they should have given it a different name ('Less Than Zero' was one of the worst).  I have to say that if you've never read the novel, you should read it ASAP.  I find that you can find more morality or at least more of a morale to the story when reading printed page versus watching the screen since we tend to get so wrapped up in the glitter and gloss (not much glitter in this film) that we get distracted from the real reason the story was written.  Our story revolves around a nameless narator (played BRILLIANTLY by Norton, another slam dunk for him here), an insomniac who, in order to find peace of mind, spends his time bounceing from group therapy meetings, sharing his fake stories and crying, he does a lot of crying, and all that release makes him, well, sleep...all until he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who is oddly stunning in this film, mixing well her 'come-hither' good looks with her 'go-away' attitude...she is repulsivly-beautiful if that is possible.  You see Marla, dispite her charm (if you call it that) is just another roadblock in our narators road to peace.  You see, knowing that there is another 'poser' in the same sessions as him, he just can't cry with her watching him and so he can't get that release and without that release he can't sleep and so our narator ends up back where he started...all until he meets Tyler (Pitt, who by the way does AMAZING here...I have to say that although I am always ragging on his 'lack of acting ability' to my wife, referring to him as a B-Grade actor, I still have to admit that he has talant, I just feel that he, like Leo alike, are widely overlooked because of their 'pretty-boy' stereotypes)...anyways...Tyler opens a door for our narator to release the stress that robs him of inner peace, and when his apartment is torched to the ground he has no where to go but to Tyler.  Everything is fine and dandy until Marla rears her attractive head and soon all hell brakes loose in a rollercoaster of a film that will leave you dazzled.  The first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club.  The second rule of Fiht Club is you don't talk about Fight Club...The third and most important rule is that you MUST WATCH Fight Club to understand the NEED for Fight Club...EXCELENT MOVIE
B000002KHH|5.0|I'm sitting on my sofa, the lights dimmed down, while the first crushing chords of War Pigs come pouring over me. Geezer Butler's throbbing bass lines and Bill Ward's hypnotic drumming keep me mesmerized untill... silence. And then a cry shatters the silence as Ozzy Osbourne makes his presence eminent. I sat in silence throughout the entire song, mouth hung agape as Tony Iommi spit rapid fire riff after riff of metal as we now now it. Then, with a sonic guitar line that built and built and built to a epic climax, faster and faster War Pigs ended with a final bang emitted from Iommi's SG. I stopped the tape and sat in bewilderment. That day that I had stumbled upon my father's music collection has significently changed my life, even to this day. Before that I had no interest in music and knowledge therof, I would listen to whatever was \\"in\\" or radio friendly at that point in time.  <br />  Well one day I was cleaning the house when I stumbled upon a stack of tapes, all appearing to be various album's from different groups. Most I didn't know but I would in time to come (Dark Side of the Moon, Exile on Main Street, etc.) and then I stumbled upon a very beat up looking tape bearing three scribbled words that read, Black Sabbath - Paranoid. I curiously put the tape into the stereo and gave it a listen. I was amazed in the sheer power I found in songs like War Pigs and Electric Funeral. I was hooked right from the start, I knew then that I had found music. Evey day as soon as I got off the bus I would rush to my room and listen to Paranoid the whole way through. Even whilst I was away doing other things I could still hear the thundering guitar in paranoid and the insane drumming that peppers Rat Salad.  <br />   Black Sabbath jump started me  into music, leading me to other bands such as The Rolling Stones, Cream, Hendrix, The Who, The Doors, Pink Floyd, and of course, the legendary Led Zeppelin. I even started listening to heavier metal bands such as Metallica, IronMaiden, Pantera and Black Label Society. This is an essential cornerstone to the history of Rock 'N Roll, almost every metal band you can hear now has burrowed most of their sound from early Black Sabbath. Here's a basic rundown of the tracks you'll find on Paranoid; <br /> <br />War Pigs: Introduced me to Black Sabbath. Thoughtful lyrics on war mongers and the meaning of such conflict. Bill Ward does some amazing drumming on this song and Ozzy's voice is nothing short of spectacular during the dreadful verses. <br /> <br />Paranoid: Sabbath's biggest hit, and one can see why; it's catchy as all hell. Iommi gets a nice power groove going during the verses and his solo is insane! Not necessarily my favorite song on the album, but only because the song is very short and is often overplayed on the radio. There are many greater songs on this album, still a great song though. <br /> <br />Planet Caravan: Allows you to catch your breath before going head on into more of the macabre madness. A slow gloomy song with vocals that almost appear to be sung underwater by Ozzy. A good song to relax to.(Check out Pantera's cover of this song) <br /> <br />Iron Man: A classic. Pure and simple, Iron Man will stand the test of time. To guitar players like me everywhere, instantaneously the oppening riffage in Iron Man will ring a bell even to someone who is not a fan of Sabbath. A classic example of their song structures, almost seems like two songs in one as later on the song speeds up and takes a new direction. A masterpiece. <br /> <br />Electric Funeral: Probably the doomsiest song on Paranoid, one that is filled with the horrors of chemical warfare. Great wah wah line Iommi uses throughout the first half of the song, because again this song speeds up midway through and becomes almost a different song entire. <br /> <br />Hand of Doom: My personal favorite song on the album, with the haunting bass line echoed throughout the verses and Ozzy whispering menacingly, \\"Push the needlein...\\" This song also follows Sabbath's song form, speeding up midway through. Right when you think the song will fade out Iommi comes back in with lightning fast guitar and then the whole song turns into the hand on speed. Ending then after softly with the haunting guitar line. <br /> <br />Fearies Wear Boots: A great Sabbath song, my second favorite on Paranoid. A song that will at times make you laugh, a stoner's tribute almmost. Amazing guitar on this song, Iommi's riffs and solo are amazing. Listen and find out the meaning yourself. <br /> <br />Rat Salad: A fun little instrumental with great guitar from Iommi and bass from Terrence and SPECTACULAR drumming from Bill Ward. All musicians demonstrate why they are all such a stellar trio together, a great way to end a great album. <br /> <br />   Well there you have it, my review of the album Paranoid. Words can't explain enough how great this album really is, you'll have to listen and find out for yourself. It may change your life, I know it changed mine.
B000050FEN|5.0|And I say the best because this movie is so much more than just your typical horror film.  This film has a bite that most don't, it has a sense of reality, a gritty sense of human emotion that gets left out of most horror films.  This movie takes the time to explain it's charactors, everyone from Somerset (Freeman) to Mills (Brad Pitt in his BEST role ever) and even your killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey, Brilliant as he always is).  I thought that was the best part of this movie, that it took the time to explain your killer, took the time to get you inside his head and see why he was the way that he was and to see the reactions that he had to others and the reactions that they had to him (especially Pitt...the scene of dialog alone between Pitt and Spacey in the police car towards the end is the best scene in the film)...So our story revolves around a group of murders in NYC all based on various 'deadly-sins'...opening scene is an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst.  So you see that our killer forces his victims to kill themselves via their sin.  (The most disturbing is lust, believe me!)  So even though the film never shows a murder take place you see the aftermath of each and each one in particular is disturbing in itself.  The while air to this film is creepy, eeire and puts you in a mood before the suspence starts.  You must know that this is not the 'jump out of your seat and pee your pants' type of film, its more like the type you think about later with the lights on and your covers pulled up to your head.  It's a pschological thriller that messes with your head, makes you think about why this man did what he did and may even make you wonder if he had a point.  There is a strong moral backdrop to this movie, which is also something that is lacking in almost every other horror film.  The killer had a reason, maybe not an excuse buthe had a reason that he was able to justify in his mind for doing what he did...a reason that he calculated out, that he meditated on and most importantly, it was a reason he BELIEVED in...it was a code that he lived by and he was convinced was right even though he knew it was wrong.  Kevin Spacey is so convincing in his portrayal of a disturbed man, a man plauged by a hightened sense of morality that forced him to be morally coruptable.  This is a movie I think everyone should see, if not for sheer entertainment, see it for the message it conveys, a message that can be contorted and twisted to fit anyones interpretation, I guess the only way to really appreciate this film is to watch it and interprete it for yourself.
B0009IW88A|5.0|A surprising soundtrack. You won't hear any real main theme. So it will be quite hard for you to remember any theme at the beginning. But what could be a weakness anywhere else isn't here. Zimmer and Howard succeed in creating a strong atmosphere that served wonderfully the movie. Fans will recognize some of Zimmer's drums and some of Howard's orchestrations. The result is a subtle yet strong soundtrack that should please many fans.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Before I start reviewing this album, let me clear something up for those who don't know: the Gorillaz are NOT, I repeat, NOT rap or hip hop of any kind. Just because they release a couple singles that feature rap artists (\\"Feel Good Inc.\\" and \\"Clint Eastwood\\") doesn't automatically make them a rap group. The Gorillaz by themselves are more techno than rap. I'd also like Amazon.com to know this and please remove the Gorillaz from the rap category.<br /><br />In fact, the Gorillaz are more along the lines of Beck, if nothing else. They're quite the creative bunch, using all sorts of things from synthesizers and gospel choirs to acoustic and bass guitars. There's even a 15 year-old Japanese girl named Miho Hatori (or Noodle, as most Gorilla fans know her as) here who does most of the guitar work. She's pretty skilled for her young age and adds a nice touch to the Gorillaz sound. Frontman Damon Albarn, more commonly known as 2-D, has dry and haunting vocals that compliment the many sounds on the album and even tries his hand at rapping on the single \\"Feel Good Inc.\\". Bassist Jamie Hewlett, also known as Murdoc, performs some essential bass work on tracks like \\"Last Living Souls\\", which also features a soothing violin arrangement appearing near the end of the song that carries on for the remainder of the track, not to mention some acoustic guitaring as a prequel to the violins. Another great track is \\"Dirty Harry\\", which features synth work and a young boy's choir that back up 2-D's vocals. But the song changes pace entirely about halfway through when Booty Brown drops an addictive verse. \\"Dare\\", a funky song in the vein of disco, is a great club banger and should be their next single, in my opinion.<br /><br />But along with the upbeat songs come more mellow tracks like \\"November Has Come\\", which features underground rap artist MF Doom and more haunting vocals from 2-D. \\"Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head\\" is somewhere in between the upbeat and the mellow, featuring Dennis Hopper telling a story that somewhat resembles that of humans. 2-D's vocal work on the chorus is arguably the best on the album and is backed up by some short-lived acoustic guitar. \\"El Manana\\" is a slightly depressing song with an everpresent siren in the background and great acoustic work. This song is a good example of what 2-D can do with his voice and is a quintessential Gorillaz track that wouldn't be too out of place on their self-titled debut.<br /><br />Now for the rest. \\"Kids With Guns\\" is a catchy song with a great beat and an addictive bass line from Murdoc. \\"O Green World\\" is a very odd song that opens with some strange synth sounds and a heavy beat with little chirps all throughout the song. \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" is also heavy and extremely catchy, though the beat lets up a bit during 2-D's verses. \\"All Alone\\" is a fast-paced song with a haphazard beat and an appearance by Roots Manuva. \\"White Light\\" is another heavy, fast-paced song with some catchy synth sounds and some choral vocals near the end. \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\" is a melodic tune featuring a gospel choir and some great vocals from 2-D. And last but not least, the previous song carries on into \\"Demon Days\\", the closing of this volume of the Gorillaz experience. It also has a gospel choir in it, and features some synth and guitar work until it fades.<br /><br />Overall, this album gets a 10/10. Very few albums in today's music world have this kind of creativity, and the sound is refreshing from other groups' tendency to have the same sound throughout the whole album. The only thing I miss is the presence of Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, whose creative rap verses brightened songs on the last album. But hey, \\"Demon Days\\" is still excellent.featuring Dennis Hopper telling a story that somewhat resembles that of humans. 2-D's vocal work on the chorus is arguably the best on the album and is backed up by some short-lived acoustic guitar. \\"El Manana\\" is a slightly depressing song with an everpresent siren in the background and great acoustic work.

B000AP04FG|4.0|Doug Liman is currently one of my favorite action directors and this mvie doesn't disappoint. On about the first quarter of the movie when Pitt and Jolie's married couple discovered each one's identity, there is a very refreshing memory of Danny DeVito's War of the Roses that occurred to me. It was the best part of the film, when one lead is counting the other's footsteps, you don't know exactly what will happen. The OC's Adam Brody is in here, and he pretty much played the comic goof he is in the TV series and did his part well. Its not that movie even needs more laughs, between Pitt and Jolie, the movie have enough of that amusing comic factor in it.
B000002UAX|3.0|The White Album  The Beatles  1968    I do believe that The White Album is a bit overrated. But no doubt about it, it is a good album.    The First Disc: It starts off with Back In The U.S.S.R. One of the best, most rocking Beatles songs ever. Obladi Oblada, another awesome one, that never gets old. Apperntly this is reggae... I don't see it. Anyway. While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Great song, somewhat dark, with Eric Clapton helping George out on guitar. Martha My Dear is also a great piano song. I Will is also a great song. Although the first disc holds pretty bad songs like Wild Honey Pie and The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill.    The Second Disc: Birthday is a pretty good rock song. Helter Skelter. This song is great, but insane. This is not your typical Beatles song at all. Although what is a typical Beatle song? This is a hard, grungy, metal song, screamed by Paul. Honey Pie is a very nice song too. A bit 40's I guess it would be. Revolution 1 is pretty good. And now comes the controversial \\"song\\": Revolution 9. Waste of space on this album. A 9 minute+ track filled with random noise. I gave it a chance. The first few minutes were interesting, but when it comes down to it, this is a ridiculous thing to put on The White Album.    This is a fair album, just for the mentioned first few songs on the first disc. The only reason it remains with 3 stars is for the price. For a random person, not for you. But for a Beatle fan: Essential.
0316168815|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I was given this book while I was grieving the loss of a loved one.  This book  described some of the things my loved ones and I experienced while going through the grieving process.  After reading this book - it gave me hope.
6305736650|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on a play entitled \\"Everybody Comes to Rick's.\\"<br /><br />This movie starts with the following narration:<br /><br />\\"With the coming of the second world war many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully or desperately toward the freedom of the Americas.  Lisbon became the great embarkation point.  But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.  And so a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.  Paris to Marseilles, across the Mediterranean to Oran.  Then by train or auto or foot across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco.  Here the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.  And from Lisbon to the New World.  But the others wait in Casablanca: and wait and wait and wait...\\"<br /><br />The story that can be described as a \\"romantic thriller\\" begins from here and takes place about a year after the Germans invaded France.  Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) wander into Rick's caf&eacute; in Casablanca.  The two are on the run from the Nazis and have come to Rick's to obtain exit visas or letters of transit.  But the German-controlled local government, headed by a \\"poor, corrupt official\\" Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) is on the move, and Laszlo has to act quickly to get the exit visas he came for, then escape.  Ilsa doesn't know that the \\"saloon-keeper\\" who runs the cafe is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), the one true love of her life whose heart she broke.  When the two meet again sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back.  So when Ilsa offers herself in exchange for Laszlo's safe transport out of the country, the bitter Rick must decide what's more important: his own happiness or the lives that hang in the balance.<br /><br />This movie is famous, among other things, for the song \\"As Time Goes By\\" played by Rick's piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) and first encountered by the lovers Ilsa and Rick.  Ilsa when she enters Rick's caf&eacute; asks Sam the following:<br /><br />\\"Play it once, Sam...Play it Sam.  Play `As Time Goes By'...Sing it Sam.  (The line \\"Play it again, Sam\\" never appears in the movie.)  Here are some of the lyrics:<br /><br />\\"You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply, as time goes by.  And when two lovers woo, they still say I love you, on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings, as time goes by.\\"<br /><br />The dialogue uttered by all the actors, especially by Humphrey Bogart is unforgettable.  Here are four of my favorite Bogey lines:<br /><br />(1) \\"Here's looking at you, kid.\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.\\"<br /><br />(3) \\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"<br /><br />(4) Rick is asked by an official what his nationality is.  Rick's reply: \\"I'm a drunkard.\\"<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal especially by Bogart and Bergman.  Special mention should also go to Clause Rains as the Captain.<br /><br />The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD (the one by Warner Studios, released in June 2005) is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has three extras: (1) a documentary hosted by Bogart's widow Lauren Bacall (35 min) (2) original theatrical trailer (3) other theatrical trailers of famous Bogart movies.  I found all these extras interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie has it all: good background music, great dialogue, an interesting story, good acting, and interesting cinematography.  Be sure to see it and discover why it was voted by the American Film Institute the second best movie of all time and why it won three Academy Awards (including Best Picture)!!!<br /><br />(1942;  105 min;  black and white;  36 scenes;  full screen)<br /><br />+++++ered by the lovers Ilsa and Rick.

0671027387|2.0|Dan Brown has hit upon a formula for his novels where (if you've read some of them) you will recognize the protagonist, the nomitive antagonist, a supporting character(s) who you are lead to believe is working for the antagonist and, finally (and near the end), the actual bad guy.  The bad guy's identity is usually a surprise in that the material preceding the finale is even handed and unbiased.<br /><br />Brown has followed this formula for at least 4 of the books I have read, and frankly it is wearing thin.<br /><br />He has always managed to serve up politically neutral material before this one, however.  But not here.<br /><br />He has taken pains to paint one political party as above board and sacrifing and the other to be featured by a self-centered, abusive personality.  He has even taken the opportunity to paint the nation's military in an unfavorable light.<br /><br />Altogether a disappointing book!
B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"Beggars Banquet\\" is one of the top 50 or so rock albums ever produced. That being said, I would still have to rank \\"Exile on Main Street\\" as the Stones' greatest work. From top to bottom this album is brilliant and perfectly displays what the Stones are all about. I won't say all the stuff thats already been said so I'll just share some of my favorite moments from the album. \\"Dear Doctor\\" always puts me in a good mood when I hear it and is a fun song to sing along with. This was also their first foray into country rock. \\"No Expectations\\" is a beautiful song with some great slide guitar by Brian Jones. The closer \\"Salt of the Earth\\" is a good precursor to the next album's \\"You Can't always Get What you Want\\". Finally, the highlight for me is \\"Stray Cat Blues\\". Never had a rock song been so nasty and sexual. To me this is the song that transformed the Stones. All of you know the hits so I won't bother. Buy this one first then check out \\"Sticky Fingers\\" before you bite into \\"Exile\\".
B0007M22TI|5.0|This is without doubt one of the coolest DVDs of music I've bought in a long time....whatever the begrudgers say, I guess that's what happens when you do something good, this is a class act. <br /> <br />Of course the girls, and the orchestrs and band, but on this DVD also the set and lights and sound is spectacular. Not usually a fan of this sort of thing but in this case I make an exception! I'm a Celtic Woman convert. <br /> <br />Thanks girls and everyone involved. It's obvious how much effort went into this, it just shines out of the TV screen!!!
B000AMWIVM|1.0|this review is not so much of the contents of this DVD release , as it is of the fact that Lions Gate is putting out a 'special edition' of the film not even a year but only 8 MONTHS after the currently available edition was released. As consumers we need to protest this 'double-dipping' in the onoly way we can: by refusing to buy.
B000021YQV|5.0|What genre is System of a Down? Originally I thought SOAD was Heavy Metal, but now I'm hearing Hard Rock? <br /> <br />Eh, well genre aside, I am so glad to have bought this cd. I'm a person who 5 days ago nearly hated Metal, screaming music. SOAD changed this for me. SOAD mixes catchy melodies with rythmical screaming. I am a permanent fan.  <br />This is most definately a cd worth buying, even if Metal music isn't your favorite. Especially now when it's an older cd and the price has dropped. <br /> <br />If you have Windows Media Player, a few of the songs are available in the \\"Media Guide\\"([...] If those songs don't sway you, then I don't know what to say.
0895260131|5.0|With all the scrutiny and the literally thousands of books and studies written about the new and old testaments and the Jewish and Christian faiths it most certainly is time that realistic and critical books be written about the most secretive and certainly most agressive of religions ... Islam ... <br /> <br /> <br />Most schools, students and authors (look around you if you wonder why} would not really touch this topic with a 10 foot pole. Other religions have had what we call the dark ages and before modern civilization took effect ... so as we see people bombing and cutting off heads of men women children, all in the name of Allah, all while praising Allah, what is the average Christian supposed to believe?  What are we to think of a religion that for all intents and purposes is happy to blow themselves and as many infidels (thats you me and our kids BTW)into total smitherines only to be rewarded by a guaranted trip to heaven where they get to spend eternity with 72 'hori' virgins....  <br /> <br /> <br />Trust me you are not going to get any of your Moslem friends to really talk much about their religion because they are not allowed to ... You are not going to have any of them talk much about the content of the Quran .. because they are not allowed to ...  <br /> <br /> <br />This book takes a mountain of misconceptions and outright falsehoods and debunks them in a clear easy to read style. The chapters are well laid out and considerable time is spent in refreshing our memories about why we had the Crusades in the first place .....
B000002VSN|5.0|Listen to this CD. Then you will understand why Whitney Houston is simply incomparable. There will never be another as she is. This gospel compilation is simply delicious, but also full of strenght, energy. My favourite tracks are: \\"Hold on, help is on the way\\", \\"Who would imagine a king\\", \\"I`ll go to the rock\\" and \\"I believe in you and me\\". <br />Whitney....we miss you....give us THAT voice again and again...
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Maybe that's the problem .... So if you can accept the fact of I guess a 'dark angel' with black wings telling Constantine that unless he finds accpetance from God for the good things he's doing ... well then he's 'f..cked'  I really thought was over the top ....  <br /> <br /> <br />For the viewers that are looking for Matrix like overdoses then this is probably a 5 star special .... certainly modern cinematography has done marvels to exorcism scenes ... but anyone looking for a storyline that is coherent as in 'The Exorcist' ... well forget it ....  <br /> <br /> <br />The storyline will make sense to only the most avid of fans .....
0140288503|5.0|If you liked the movie you will love this book! Mark Bowden places you in the midst of this historic account as if you were there with these brave men. It's an excellent read for anyone military enthusiast. He has found an interesting and original way to tell this non-fiction story. Opens your eyes to 'modern' day war, and a peak into the meaning of 'brothers in arms'. I've always been a military supporter but somehow this book has given me a much deeper respect and admiration for those brave souls who serve their countries. This book is also an honor to those who lost their lives in this battle. Mark Bowden is an exceptional writer ... amazing read! You'll want to read it in one sitting!
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka an ancient wordwhich tranlates into 'blessing' is very aptly named as a reminder to us of the intrinsic beauty of the world and all of Gods creatures.  <br /> <br /> <br />Filmed in 70 mm in 24 countries we get a birds eye view of the world around us without the unneccesary babbling of some idiot announcer telling us what we are seeing. Also we get no incoherent diatribe by politically correct idiots trying to put these wonderfull scenes into meaningless words .... The idiocy and the appreciation of beauty comes from your friends who may see this DVD with you.... I was was awed by the beauty of this DVD only to be surprised by one of my friends to find that she thinks the movie was 'depressing' ..... WOW ...  <br /> <br /> <br />It's not a DVD movie but rather an event or an experience .... a hust have for ANY video collection  <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Mezmerize isn't as good as SOAD's previous albums, but it's still pretty good. The first time I ever heard B.Y.O.B.  I honestly thought they'd taken a turn for the worst. But I've always been a big SOAD fan so I decided to go out and buy it before I jumped to any more conclusions. It turns out that this is a pretty solid CD from beginning to end. There was one song that really caught my attention though; \\"Question!\\". This is my favorite song on Mezmerize because it's very well written as far as lyrics go and I love the acoustic guitar on this track. I'm pretty sure the last song they used an acoustic guitar on was \\"Mr. Jack\\" from \\"Steal This Album\\". Anyways, Mezmerize is definitely worth buying, but I definitely suggest that you buy either \\"Toxicity\\" or \\"Steal This Album\\" in addition to this CD.
B000001G53|3.0|I really can't see this as a serious contender in the Parsifal stakes. It's all surface gloss without any depth or understanding. Karajan, as was his wont, went for beauty of texture and sound, an obvious temptation in this, the one opera Wagner wrote with the unique sound of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus already in his mind. And it has to be admitted that Karajan achieved it. The Berliners play like a dream. If that's all you look for in this opera, then fine.<br /><br />But Parsifal is a much more elusive animal than that. It has to do with being able to see the piece as a whole - it has its own rhythms, the way different rates of breathing, as it were, relate to each other, that goes way beyond mere tempos and metre. Knappertsbusch at Bayreuth in 1951 has it at very slow speeds. Toscanini, of all people, was the slowest in the Bayreuth records. Levine at slow speeds is just tedious. Boulez, with lighter textures and consistently faster speeds had it. Karajan doesn't.<br /><br />Then there are the singers. A dull lot for the most part. None of them would be first choice for any of their parts. Hofmann is too wobbly, van Dam too 'beautiful' for Amfortas' anguish, Moll too pedestrian - Gurnemanz can be a dreadful bore if he's not sung off the text with real conviction - Vejzovic sounds as if she's from another production. The most consistent cast is probably Knappertsbusch in 1951 again (a youthful Windgassen, a dedicated Weber, a no-holds-barred Modl and a really scary Uhde) or Solti (Frick, Ludwig and Fischer-Dieskau standing out plus a Premier Division team of Flowermaidens that includes te Kanawa and Popp). It's a great shame that Vickers never recorded the part of Parsifal - he was the best I've ever heard on stage (with Goodall no less) - does the BBC have a tape?<br /><br />The sound, too - no doubt supervised by Karajan in dictator mode - strives too hard for beauty at the expense of integration and depth. This, as I've said, is the one opera specifically written for the unique Bayreuth acoustic. To hear the first notes of the Prelude emerge from the silence and the darkness in that house is a special experience. Wagner's own design allows the instruments to blend and merge in an almost impressionistic way before they're thrown into the stage by the hood over the orchestra, there to blend with the voices (not create a wall in front of them) before they emerge into the auditorium. Strings acquire a special bloom: the heavy brass, buried deep down under the stage, do not get the strident edge so popular with modern producers. Kanppertsbusch's later Bayreuth performance for Philips probably captures this sound best, but his 1951 (mono) performance, recorded by Decca, is not a bad second.<br /><br />All in all, then, a disappointment on most fronts - unless you just want to wallow in the sound of the Berlin Philharmonic.written for the unique Bayreuth acoustic.

B00000I8UD|3.0|In 1999, over ten years after his previous solo album and masterpiece, \\"Secrets of the Beehive\\", several collaborative efforts with such figures as Holger Czukay and Robert Fripp, and at least one album that never came to be (several tracks from which ended up on the leadoff single for this album, \\"I Surrender\\"), David Sylvian finally produced a record in \\"Dead Bees on a Cake\\".  Supported by a pool of musicians of breathaking quality, including drummers Steve Jansen, Ged Lynch and Scooter Warner, tabla player Talvin Singh, guitarists Bill Frisell and Marc Ribot, bassist John Giblin, trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, and frequent collaborator Ryuichi Sakamoto, expectations were enormous for this record. <br /> <br />Perhaps it was a bit unfair-- after all, repeating the artistic success of \\"Secrets of the Beehive\\" would be nearly impossible, and ten years does have a tendency to heighten anticipation.  Still, the album doesn't quite meet expectations.  My suspicion is that without the presence of an outside producer, Sylvian wasn't editorial enough of his own work-- the album stretches around 70 minutes long, and with a number of pieces in the middle of the record that sound a bit too straight for Sylvian's work (dull ballads \\"Alphabet Angel\\", \\"Cafe Europa\\", \\"Wanderlust\\", and cliche ridden \\"Krishna Blue\\") present on the record, the album doesn't quite making it.  Were all these lopped off (or at least some of them....), the album would have been stronger.  <br /> <br />Still, there's quite a bit of good material on the record, much of which features Ribot in a strong context-- bizarre fractured rock piece \\"God Man\\" filled with broken rhythms, fierce blues \\"Midnight Sun\\" where Ribot provides a jaw dropping solo, and instrumental \\"All of My Mother's Names\\" (where Ribot's pedigree with John Zorn becomes clear) all stand out nicely.  For that matter, dobro (courtesy of Bill Frisell) and vocal duet \\"Dobro #1\\" is equally fantastic, with bizarre and esoteric lyrics and great open playing, and even overlong opening ballad \\"I Surrender\\" (where Kenny Wheeler shines on horn) features an impassioned and wonderful vocal. <br /> <br />In all, it's an ok album, not the best certainly by Sylvian, but listenable.  Start with the '80s Virgin material first, in particular \\"Secrets of the Beehive\\", then consider this record.
B0000042H4|5.0|Of the 15 or so complete Rings + numerous recordings of the separate operas that sit on my shelves, this was the first I acquired, originally bought as the sets were issued. So is it just because these were the performances from which I learnt my Ring that this is the version I still return to most often? Krauss is probably the best available performance, but the sound is fragile and friable. Windgassen and Nilsson are both more exciting in the live environment of Bohm's recording, but I'd like to shoot that prompter. Goodall is full, for me, of memories in the theatre and provides the best large-scale symphonic view, but his orchestra is good rather than great. Boulez is, as always, refreshing and elucidating, but let down by the quality of his singers.<br /><br />So I keep coming back to Solti. Not perfect by any means, but still the best combination of sound, performance, interpretation and production you'll find. The casting is top-notch and often inspired - from Flagstad's first glorious Fricka in Rheingold to Fischer-Dieskau's flawed and vulnerable Gunther (he once famously described Gotterdammerung as 'a family tragedy'). Rhinemaidens, Valkyries and Norns include many a future Brunnhilde and the like - the Waldvogel is no less than Joan Sutherland!<br /><br />Solti's conducting, much hailed at the time of release, has come in for increasing criticism over the years. Yes, he can be a bit hard-driven: yes, he can be too episodic: yes, he can pile pilion on ossa at some of the climaxes (though not as much as in the theatre). But he undoubtedly has a vision of the whole work which he sticks to. And he does draw the most glorious sounds and playing from the Vienna Philharmonic.<br /><br />And then there's the contribution of John Culshaw and his team. The sound, even after all these years, is still about the best you can get in these works - clean and analytical but also full-bodied with masses of depth and perspective. More than a match for later studio recordings like Levine and Haitink. And the production and effects still work, too - from Rheingold's anvils to that famous distant rumble of thunder on Brunnhilde's rock that had Solti looking out of the control room window - not to mention the collapse of the Gibichung Hall; a real cartridge-tester, that, in the days of vinyl).<br /><br />Put it all together and this remains the best all-round recommendation for a first Ring. 'The greatest achievement of gramophone history' it was called at the release of Gotterdammerung. Probably it still is. But I wouldn't want to be without quite a few of those other 14 versions on the shelf - it can get addictive, this Ring business.ordings like Levine and Haitink.

0393317552|4.0|Diamond makes a sound case with many examples to hold up his theory that there are no inherent biological advantages among human races.  While his premise that as agriculture develops, a kind of snowball affect takes place leading to greater and greater levels of complexity of civilization, and that some areas are better suited to the beginings of agriculture than others, that doesn't entirely account for the differences between modern cultures.<br /><br />Diamond's theory seems very reasonable when considering the origins of civilization and why the earliest complex societies were in the Fertile Cresent and in China, but he takes it a step further in trying to explain the differences between modern societies such as China, Germany, Brazil, Zaire, and the US..  I think it is obvious that modern societies have been heavily influenced by more than geographic barriers and ancient head starts in agriculture.  Also, I think it takes away from the scientific/unbiased feel of the book when Diamond keeps throwing around the term \\"racist\\" with all of its negative connotation for anyone who argues that there are inherent differences within the human race [and then he actually goes on the say that he believes his uncivilized islander friends are actually smarter than Americans], while there obviously are some differences (at least in looks) and very well could be differences in abilities as well.<br /><br />Basically, this is an interesting read that offers many insights into the evolution of global societies and may accurately explain why some peoples never developed or adopted advanced civilization's ways, but doesn't explain the persisting divergences between advanced, modern societies today.  It also doesn't prove that there are no racial differences that would give one group an advantage over another.

0743201140|4.0|Excellent book....a great way to look at peoples unique differences and abilities.  It's been a very enlightening tool for our department.  Rather than bemoaning what a coworker is not so good at, we are better able to push assignments to those who will enjoy them and do them well.  Everyone gets more opportunities to shine, and cooperation has increased.
0312330529|5.0|The best reason to read Shantaram is that it is BASED on true life incidents. And as you go through the book, you will enter a world and a life that is at once pitiful, pathetic, poignant, magical and mesmerising.  <br />As a non resident Indian reader, I found his passages of Mumbai and the infernal gangland wars and foreigners lives very fascinating. He writes like a poet after having lived the life of a criminal.  <br />And the 900+ pages hold multitudes of stories ...of the average man, the above average mafia leader, the friendships that turn into love, the humour that laces the incinerant hostility of living and loving a country like India, in the status of a convict. <br />People come alive in the book - you are mentally conjuring up images of the people who smile, discourse, love and hate...you are drawn into the politics, enticed into the exotic. <br />Wonderful book...it will leave your mind craving, your heart racing...to meet Gregory, the author...who lived through it all.

0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand's life, works, and philosophy still remain mired in dispute 23 years after her death. But you if you are reading this review page you are already knew that.  <br /> <br />My review will try to focus on the actual work in question instead of judging Rand's personality, affairs, intellectual ability, The Ayn Rand Institute, or gasp! Even her smoking (I have yet to meet somebody who had a problem with Sartre smoking). But this course of action is unlikely. <br /> <br />This book along with Anthem and Atlas Shrugged are morality plays. Just like The Scarlet Letter, Everyman, or even The Jungle (yes Virginia, socialists have morality too.).  That fact that this is a morality play is what turns some people off.  <br /> <br />The prose and plot structure turn off many people who demand \\"realism\\". I put realism in quotes because I really don't believe that this book is totally detached from reality as its detractors claim, each character is a moral abstraction. Taking bits of realistic human behavior and taking it to its logical and often ridiculous extremes. Keating is a bumbling everyman, Wynard is a Nietzschen/Stirnerien overman, Dominique is the depressed existentialist, and Howard is the Randian ideal. The only character that I would agree is totally unrealistic is Toohey, who is an abstraction for everything Rand views as evil.  <br /> <br />Now for the part you all have been waiting for, the commentary on the rape scene! My first comment will be totally off the record and totally not intellectual. \\"That's hot\\". Its no secret Rand liked to have her heroines get smacked around when they were having sex. As a male who would like his girlfriend to smack him around in bed I have no problem with this scene.  <br /> <br />Since Howard is the Randian moral ideal and he did commit rape many people assume this means that Rand supported rape. Rand also didn't help herself when she said she was a \\"male supremacist\\" and that no healthily woman would want to be President.(Well so much for not discussing Rand's beliefs). But on the same flip of the coin Atlas Shrugged main protagonist is a woman and Rand's newspaper endorsed The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. Eh I have gotten sidetracked, check out the book The Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand if this stuff interests you. <br /> <br />Well my review has gotten rather long I will end with some advice <br />1) Take all reviews on this book, including this one, with a grain of salt and read the damn book anyway. <br />2) Counting reading philosophy once you're done with the book. If you don't like Rand there are more fish in the sea. Try Camus, Sartre, Nietzsche, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, Popper, Ayer, Foucault, Thoreau, Plato, Aristotle, etc. I don't care just read some philosophy. You might learn something about yourself and the world you happen to live in.  <br />
B000094A6A|5.0|I love this movie, but the problem wasn't the movie itself, but the dvd.  The copy that was sent to us skipped in 2 or 3 spots.  It sucks when you pay good money for something and it doesn't live up to expectations.
B000002J09|5.0|I cant believe somebody gave this album one star this is one of the best albums ever, it is also the 4th best selling album ever recorded. It is a must have for any fan of classic rock.  <br /> <br />But in my opinion it is not the best zeppelin album either Houses of the Holy or Led Zeppelin I are the best.  <br /> <br />
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Why do we buy CD's?  So we can listen to them in our home, work and traveling environment, correct?  I tried to listen to this CD on my home computer that has some decent speakers (I don't have a stereo system) and the CD crashes my computer even though I have the recommended Windows XP like the back of the disk says you should have.  Most people listen to music via their computers, at home and work.  So now the only place I can listen to this CD is in my car.  That's fine and dandy, but I wouldn't consider this music really driving music, it's more of a chillin or background kinda music.  I'm tired of all this censorship and restriction.  Don't bother buying any protected CD's unless you want to be restricted to limited listening venues, meaning a portable CD player (not MP3) or your car or home stereo (sounds like alot, but at least half of the target market are younger people who only have desktops or MP3 players, not stereos or cars with CD players in them). As Napoleon Dynamite would say, \\"IDIOTS!\\".

B000AP04FG|5.0|Now, Mr. and Mrs. Smith isn't supposed to be taken seriously. It's a full throttle action ride, with a superb mix of comedy, action, domestic disputes, and of course, loud explosions. This is not a movie that will change your life. However, you're gonna have a hell of alot of fun for an amazing, utterly orgasmic two hours, reason being the incredible chemistry generated between the two leads, who are the HOTTEST on-screen couple in recent memory. The plot is basically what you would expect from your regular action/adventure film, but the script is sharp, and the dialogue between Pitt and Jolie is often hilarious and quite memorable. Doug Liman, in the tradition of Bourne Identity, has really crafted the assassin/marksman genre to almost utter perfection; despite the usual suspension of disbelief required for an action movie of this type, Pitt and Jolie are believeable in their roles, and they look like their having a blast, so it's no wonder anyone who wathces the movie will feel the same way. A must see, and one of the best action movies this generation.  <br />
0141439831|4.0|This book follows the life of two friends, Amelia Sedley and Rebecca Sharp in English society from about 1815 to 1825.  Amelia is born into a prosperous family, however they are soon to fall on hard times.  Rebecca, on the other hand, marries into a wealthy family, but her respectability is paper thin.  Amelia and her family try to make an honest living and are shunned by society while Rebecca cheats and swindles her way across Europe without censure.  The contrast in \\"Polite Society's\\" reactions to the two women show that social standing has little to do with honor and virtue, and is more at the whim of the elite. <br /> <br />It is a worthwhile read, despite several slow parts.  I think modern writers have forgotten how to write a novel (modern writers write screenplays) and it is a delight to follow an author through twists and turns that don't translate well to the big screen.  Groundbreaking at the time, this is an old story for the 21st Century reader.  We've seen many variations on this theme.  As you read, try to appreciate the effect this book would have had in 1848.
B00001QEG5|4.0|I hate to agree with some of the previous reviewers...the music on this album is very good, but it's not the kind of thing you'd expect Dee Snider to write. Most of the album pretty much implies sex (but not half as much as stupid rap does). If you don't know what I'm talking about when I say that the album implies sex, then you should look up the lyrics and take a good look at them. Does \\"do you wanna play\\" from \\"I'm So Hot for You\\" ring a bell? <br />All in all, I love the album because the music is so good, but it bothers me that Dee Snider would end up writing songs that are completely based on sex. <br />Another thing that irritates me is the lyrics that were included with the album. They look like they were written by someone who was on sleeping pills! I found that some lines were missing, and the wrong words were used in the wrong places. Also, lyrics for the bonus tracks were not included, which made it hard for me to make out the lyrics properly. <br />One thing that I really liked about the album is new drummer Joey Franco's style. He did a lot more on the drums than A.J. Pero did, and did a couple different beats. That's not to say that A.J. Pero is a bad drummer, because he's really good too.
0143034901|4.0|If words have a life of their own, in the pages of books and the the hearts of readers, then \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a story of that life; the way a good book can become a part of the reader and never be forgotten.  The story lives on in the minds of those who have read and treasured it, long after the book itself is dust.<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a rich novel, in every sense of the word.  It is peopled with passionate characters, filled with the lush landscapes of a Barcelona and Paris overshadowed by war, carried by a plot overflowing with intricacies, and suffused with the full, rich language of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a story about books, about a particular book but also about the magic that books can evoke, as here: \\"I leafed through the pages, inhaling the enchanted scent of promise that comes with all new books.\\"  Only a true book lover can recognize and write about the scent of books that way, and this is very much a story by a lover of good books, for other lovers of good books.<br /><br />The story concerns a singular book; \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Carax, and how it captures the attention of the narrator, Daniel, when he is only ten, after he discovers it in the mazelize haven of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  After falling in love with the book, he soon learns how a mysterious figure has stalked the streets and bookshops of Barcelona for years, burning any books by Carax that he can find.  Daniel makes it his mission, as he grows, to not only preserve the book that he loves, but to also find and read any other Carax novels he can uncover. The story that follows is full of dark twists and turns, family secrets are revealed and histories thought long-dead come to terrifying life once again. David's own story, as he searches for meaning in the story he is uncovering, becomes just as important, and his story and the story of Carax are told in parallel.  The conclusion of all of this is as satisfying as could be hoped for, dramatic and frightening and full of hidden danger.<br /><br />If \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" has any fault, it is that it may be a little too intricate.  While most of the side-stories told along the way fit in nicely with the main plot, there are a few that seem to meander a bit too long without much point.  Zafon tells these tangential tales with the same loving hand, and for the most part they are not a big distraction.  But for the concept of \\"stories within stories\\" to really work well, each layer should have meaning for the other layers, and that was not true all the way through here.<br /><br />Still, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a wonderful novel, tailor-made for those who treasure their books and the worlds the invite us into.  If it says anything to us, then it reminds us that words sometimes have a spirit, beyond the printed page, in the hearts and minds of those who love to read.  This is an important novel, for those of us who believe that words can have a life of their own.

B00008N6N5|5.0|This dramatic documentary taught me at least some of the key to live the one's fullest, though most of us cannot be as energetic as Larry has been. Courageous, honest, generous, fun, sad, resilient, and intense are how I describe this movie. It is too intense for light entertainment purposes, but otherwise it is a fine film to watch.
B000286RNY|5.0|This is a great film most ppl who watched it would agree... stephen chow is an extraordinary person in the sense he co-wrote/director/produced/acted in film that is funny, touching, action packed/ heart warming film that has well thought out characters and incredible special effects... if you haven't watched it go get it its worth it in everyway... <br /> <br />wow that was a really badly structured sentence any i am tired.. <br /> <br />I give 5/5 stars <br />
B000002572|5.0|No, really, how often can you call a rock album PEFECT?  There's not one dud or filler song here.  EVERY song can be commonly heard on any classic rock radio station.  That says it all! <br /> <br />With signature music such as this, it's almost no wonder the band felt they could wait so many years between albums.  Nearly 30 years and only five studio albums.  You gotta love these guys!
B000AM6MKU|5.0|Evreyone who said this movie was creepy was an idiot. this is actully one of the best christmas movies ever.
0441009425|3.0|This book was chock full of interesting concepts and characters.  I enjoyed the universe that Reynolds created.  However, this book needed an editor with a heavier hand.  The writing was difficult to slog through and at many times detracted from what was otherwise a great concept.  This is the first of his books I have read and his first novel as well, hopefully his skills as a writer will improve with experience.
B00005JNTX|5.0|When I go to the movies, I want to see stuff I haven't seen before. I don't want sequels, retreads of TV shows from my childhood nor anything with Matt Damon trying to be Jason Bourne.<br /><br />This movie is like nothing you have seen before and ( sorry to all the nay-saying reviewers ), simply ground breaking and fresh.<br /><br />Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez take hardboiled noir crime fiction and compact it into a diamond of a movie, shot through with hardboiled lugs, an honest cop and oh-so sexy dames.<br /><br />Let me address the movie's critics one at a time.<br /><br />a) No good guys.<br /><br />That is so palpably untrue. The three principle male character are all good guys - all trying to do what's right in the confines of the moral murk in which they find themselves. The bad guys aka the true murderers and the Mob all die - some really horribly in forms of almost karmic payback.<br /><br />b) The picture demeans women.<br /><br />No it doesn't. If they were all pathetic objects to be used and thrown away and potrayed as such, that might be an argument with some validity. The girls in Old Town are all in charge of their lives and are quite possibly the strongest group characters in the movie. Even Goldie makes a conscious choice when she seeks out Mikey Rourke's character. She isn't an objectified victim and he ( monster that he is ) loves her for the kindness she has shown him.<br /><br />c) Cheesey voiceovers.<br /><br />Some people never seemed to have heard of Chandler or Hammett. The dialogue fits perfectly to the movie. Like the line from Chandler \\"It was a blonde. The type of blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window\\". You can imagine both Bruce Willis' or Clive Owen's characters saying THAT line.<br /><br />Even Mikey Rourke's last line is so pitch perfect to his character. The entire dialogue is spot on for the genre.<br /><br />d) People are shot, pounded and pulverized and don't die.<br /><br />It's a movie, from a set of graphic novels. That's the genre. Heck the end of \\"The Wild Bunch\\" is pretty similar, but that doesn't detract from that movie being the greatest American film of the 20th century. And isn't it really what you want in a movie, the good guys to keep getting up and the bad guys to go down horribly? That's oh so satisfying on a fundamentally moral level. I'm not looking for \\"realism\\" in movies, that's not why I go. If I wanted that, excreable flicks like Gary Oldman's \\"Nil By Mouth\\" would have been a box office smash and people would have seen Ewen MacGregor's \\"Young Adam\\".<br /><br />d) Jessica Alba's relationship with Bruce's character.<br /><br />Disturbing? Yes. Probably meant to be and Bruce realizes it's wrong and ultimately does something about it. He does the honorable thing. As I said previously, all the principle male charcaters are essentially good guys and do the right thing in the end. Ms Alba's motivation? I can quite easily accept that her affection for the one man who ever showed her kindness could, over time in a place as morally bankrupt as Sin City, become something deeper for her ( and so more difficult for him ).<br /><br />e) The stories not connected.<br /><br />They are if you stay to the end. Just not in any kind of grand way. The characters all cross paths, that's all. That's OK with me. Everyone doesn't have to know everyone else.<br /><br />To conclude, this is one of the best movies of 2005, a perfect fit of style and more style.It's a movie, from a set of graphic novels.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|I enjoyed Kung Fu Hustle immensely.It is outstanding in many respects,but most of all it's nice to see a movie that is so creative and genuinely funny,funny,funny!It should have been in theaters much longer.Steven Chow has captured the light Charlie Chaplin,Buster Keaton,Mack Sennett,Preston Sturges,Howard Hawks and so many other early screwball directors had and even the zaniness of the Warner Brothers Cartoons.What a great time at the movies.I highly recommend it.
B000026C3T|5.0|Led Zeppelin are, without doubt, the utmost fantastic and brilliant rock band to come out of britain, nay, the entire world, it contains all the tracks casual listeners want to hear, and enough of Zeppelins greatness to satisfy the hardcore fans, and if you have never bought a Led album before, I reccomend this one, and if you dont like it, well, you simply have no taste in good music!    Tracks included are:    Disc one:    1. Communication Breakdown: pure hardcore jamming riffery, classic! 9/10    2. Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You: chilled and very spanish sounding guitar, very cool! 9/10    3. Good Times, Bad Times: one of my favorite tracks, head banging and finger tapping, Plant's vocals sound ace, and Bohnam's drumming on the intro is superb: 10/10    4. Dazed and Confused: great, offbeat and hardcore, well contrasted with the minor key upbeat good times bad times, 8/10    5. Whole Lotta Love: Absolute classic! As usual Page is awesome, pulling out all the stops on the track that any Brit will recognise (trust me on this) 9/10    6. Heartbreaker: Pure Rock, guitar orientated and brutal, yet upbeat, the minuite long solo in the middle is eye-crossingly complex and one of my goals as a guitarist is to learn it! 10/10    7. Ramble on: acoustic greatness, and once again Robert Plant is awesome, and at one point he sings about the lord of the rings' Gollum. (wierd but cool?!!!) 8/10    8. Immigrant Song: If youve seen The Scool of Rock with Jack Bleck you will recognise this hardcore classic war-rock tune, this is so cool! 9/10    9. Celebration Day: Plants Vocals are simply awesome in this upbeat tune, what I like to thisk of as \\"happy music\\" (ie. music I listen to when in a good mood) 8/10    10. Since Ive been loving you: depressing and uplifting song about the lost labours of love, with some awesome riffery on the part of Jimmy Page. 9/10    11. Black Dog: \\"hey hey mama said the way you move...\\" brilliant, climactic and offbeat hard rock! 9/10    12. Rock and Roll:Does exactly what it says on the tin, rocks you and rolls you untill you fall over, this is classic twelve-bar-blues style rock and roll of the kind introduced by Bert Wheedon in the early sixties, yeah! 9/10    13. The Battle of the Evermore: a little classic brit mythology coming into play here as one of Led's great obsessions, one of the more upbeat bouncy tunes on the album. 8/10    14. Misty Mountain Hop: cactchy and tuneful, a great song but simply no match for the awesome... (8/10)    15. Stairway to Heaven: there is no plausable way i can describe the brilliance and utter genius of this track, this is, by far, one of the greatest songs ever created, just listen to it, if you disagree you do not deserve this album, you do not deserve to listen to music at all this is so awesome! 10/10     Disc Two    1. The Song Remains the Same: The song with the longest intro ever, the actual lyrics dont start until exactly 1:29 minuites into the song, but when they do its worth the wait, tuneful and catchy! 8/10    2. The Rain Song: upbeat and catchy, a song about the happines of love, this is another example of \\"Happy Music\\". 9/10    3.D'yer Maker: captivating tunefullness, warning: this song WILL make you tap you fingers or drum on the table with a pencil, 9/10    4. No Quarter: another song about Led's obsession with mythology, this time more major key, and page's sawtooth chords add a contrasting edge to the softness of the synth background notes, climactic and brilliant! 10/10    5.  Houses of the Holy: \\"So Let Me Take You To The Movies, Let me Take You Take You To The Show\\" sings Plant at the climax of this tuneful catchy song about falling in love. 9/10    6. Kashmir: A beat reminiscent of of the lobby scene from The Matrix and accompanied by the most brilliant lyrics you can imagine, do the first two lines remind you of anything (in oceans twelve they were spoken by Matt Damons Toby, can you spot it?) 9/10    7. Trampled Underfoot: ooh soo different from the hardness of Kashmir, this upbeat synth-guitar love tune is accompanied by some raw and great vocals, once again from Plant. 8/10    8. Nobodys Fault But Mine: Man! that intro is Cool! just listen to it, its climactic and the beat works its way into you easily and its becomes of of those Final Countdown like songs (it doesnt sound like the final countdown mind) that never get out of your head. 8/10    9. Achilles Last Stand: tuneful guitar riffery and some great drumming from Bonham, this is a great song, and has some awesome lyrics. 8/10    10. All My Love: great Synth beat that almost dominates Page's Guitar implants but never descends into that Europe-esque Synth-pop that rock fans despise so. 8/10    11. In The Evening: strange and tuneful, page's guitar adds that once again nescesary edge to a song accompanied by a very different vocal style by Robert Plant, although you can still detect that essential Plantness in his voice that we have grown so accustomed to, a great tune. 9/10    that concludes our tour of one of the best albums in my collection and i hope this review was helpful to you and i hope you agree with my views on led zeppelin, if so maybe you acn email me, meybe we like the same bands?

B00006SFLV|5.0|\\"My So-Called Life' is a classic- forgotten as it was 'just TV'. The 19 episodes prior to it getting cancelled were classic- much better than the anodyne Hitler-youth utopia of 'Dawson's Creek' or the vile 'Party of Five'.<br /><br />It caught the era of teenagedom wonderfully- with a nod towards grunge music- but felt like a teen-soap that might have read 'Smithereens' & 'Generation X'. The characters were great- and one of the benefits of being a TV show meant that we could focus on any one at any given point.<br /><br />Jared Leto stands out as Jordan Cataleno- he would make an excellent transition to adult films such as 'American Psycho', 'Fight Club' & 'Requiem for a Dream'. Plus, blink and you miss him in 'The Thin Red Line'...Claire Danes is great as Angela- a likeable performance when it could have been irritating. What happened to her career?...Ricky is a dude- nice to have not only a homosexual character but one of mixed race- he popped up as a butler in 'Nixon'.<br /><br />I feel it was the presence of his storyline and the gay teacher that contributed to this being cancelled. It would happen in this country- where we have 'Clause 28' which prohibits reference to homosexuality in schools I felt this storyline was believable (unlike the one in 'Dawsons Creek') and would help people empathise with such a character...Rayanne was a great character- again, we were given a mess of a person- promiscous (a faker?), hedonistic and the worst kind of best friend (who meant well...). Sharon is Angela's slighted best-friend who develops wonderfully over the series. Plus Gram Chase's character is great- he is close to an affair with his business partner at the end- much like his affair Angela discovers around the pilot episode.<br /><br />The best character is Brian Krackow- the unrequited lover of Angela and king of the nerds. Kevin Williamson would rip him off for 'Dawson Leary'- though make him more utopian and therefore less truthful...The best episodes are the one with Buffalo Tom, the 'Weekend' episode (a handcuff populated farce which will remind anyone of teenage parties) and the fun Halloween episode. Love the fact we never see Ricky's cousin!...I've still got this on longplay video from 1997 and everyone I've shown it to has loved it...They ought to do a sequel for 'adults' on HBO- and get Elizabeth Wutzel to write it! Proof, along with programmes like 'Larry Sanders', 'The Sopranos' & 'Twin Peaks' that TV-drama can be fantastic and anything but a formula ridden distraction.\\"the one with Buffalo Tom, the 'Weekend' episode (a handcuff populated farce which will remind anyone of teenage parties) and the fun Halloween episode.

B000057NVH|5.0|So much has already been written about this title musing and pondering over this \\"format\\" and that \\"remaster\\" so I'll keep my words brief.I don't claim to be an audiophile nor am I an expert on the works of Mr.Oldfield but I do know a good recording when I hear one and this particular reissue of \\"Tubular Bells\\" sounds incredible.I am not old enough to have heard this recording in it's original Quad vinyl pressing and cannot see the need to spend money on a Quad Turntable(record player) so I can hear a few recordings from the seventies the way they were meant to be heard.Therefore,I'm more than happy to be offered the chance to hear these four channel mixes of some of the greatest albums of our time on SACD(check out Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\").Besides,I don't care how expensive your turntable is,you will still get surface noise and rumble coming through your speakers.Something you don't hear off a digital disc!So,if you are not too pedantic about how you listen to \\"Tubular Bells\\",this is the closest you can get to true Quad Sound in 2005!!! Fantastic!!!!
B000002V0Q|5.0|this is the follow up to rust in piece and megadeth's evolution into the mainstream metal that many a band has done, most notably, metallica's black album. it starts off with a bang with skin o' my teeth, which is a great song, one of the best on the album. next is symphony of destruction, which was the first megadeth song i ever heard. another stand out track is sweating bullets. its basically dave just being himself, aka a nut. awesome song and one of my favorites. all songs on here are solid, captive honour and psychotron standing out for me, but the last song, ashes in your mouth, is probly the best on the disc. perfect song. the album started with a bang, and ends with one too. a change for megadeth but a good one at that. the next album would continue this new sound, and continue it well... <br /> <br />overall, great cd if youre a megadeth fan, must have. not thrash, but still a good metal release.
B00009MEA5|5.0|Movies of this genre tend to be quite predictable, and so I try to avoid them; but under the impression that the ending had a unique twist, I gave it a try.  In the end, I find myself in a position where I have to admit that this is an excellent movie--and not only because the ending is not (thankfully) predictable.  The movie obviously has an agenda, and therefore will obviously have its diehard detractors, but objectively, it does make a strong case for why capital punishment is unacceptable.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|i have the original album and was looking at another megadeth album to buy and i said to myself, hey, i think countdown deserves being bought twice. i was a little scared when i first popped this one in as some of the singing in skin o my teeth sounded a little different, i couldve just been me though. sound quality is improved and that would be the main reason for getting this if you have the original, but the reason for me was the bonus tracks. crown of worms might have fit a little better on youthanasia but is still awesome to here on this one. its also pretty cool to hear the demos. the really dont add much to the cd but its nice to hear some of the original ideas for the songs. when i first heard the symphony demo i broke out laughing. dave sounds like he's chewing on a frog or something while singing the first few lines,(he admits that he didnt sound very good in that one in the booklet) but he sounds continously better throughout the song. another overlooked thing in these remastered albums are the booklets. they contain a lot of interesting info about what happened and how things went with the album, as you get to read comments wrote by dave himself. <br /> <br />overall, if you have the original, you might want to pick this up for the better sound quality or crown of worms and the demos, but if your not a die hard fan, you could probly overlook it.
0140072187|5.0|When this book came out was shortly after I had completed the very first AOBC (Aviation Officers Basic Course) at Fort Rucker. Following that is ORWAC (Officer Rotary Wing Aviator's Course) of course, so I read it while I was trying to learn how to fly helicopters.<br /><br />His descriptions of learning to hover were dead on (of course they didn't help, not much does) and that lent everything else the \\"air of authority\\". His style is very readable and his information is first hand and accurate.<br /><br />Excellent book and a must-read for anyone interested in helicopters, Vietnam or just a good military book.
B000002TPS|5.0|this album contiues the new mainstream sound that megadeth started on countdown. its not quiet as heavy. (very close though) it contains some of the best song writing ive ever heard on a cd before however. reckoning day is usually overlooked by me because of the following song, train of consequenses. easily one of my favorite megadeth tunes. so catchy. probly holds the record for most days a song has been stuck in my head. the main riff is also amazingly catchy. the album is solid the whole way through, a tout le monde is great, definatly a stand out track. many other good ones along the way and then comes victory. pretty funny song accually, somes up megadeths career using song titles. it also contains one of the greatest lines in a song EVER... not even close, not even close, not even close to overdose!!! awesome.    overall, great album, carrying on the sound developed in coutdown and featuring some great songwriting. contains some huge hits and is a must have for megadeth fans. thrash? nope. metal? yeah but pretty mainstream at that.
0385513755|5.0|'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown quite simply is one of the greatest books I have ever read. There is a very good reason why this book has sold millions upon millions of copies, and remains near the top of every bestseller list years after its release.<br /><br />Repeat, there is a reason why.<br /><br />In his novel, Dan Brown begins with a murder inside the Louvre and then goes from there to spin a tale the likes of which few authors have ever been able to create. The work that Brown does here is an opus, it's the kind of life's work that few authors hope to come close to reaching.<br /><br />I find it fascinating looking at all the reviews that have been posted, as there seems to be no middle ground when it comes to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Either one loves it or hates it, and for the most part, people LOVE this book. Like the movie Million Dollar Baby with it's controversial turn, this book looks Christians squarely in the face and when they look back in return many don't like what they are staring at. I am not saying that what Dan Brown writes is based on facts (he'll be the first to remind you that it is a fictional work), but one thing this novel will get you to do is think.<br /><br />I don't believe in giving away the spoiler moments of books, especially ones that I love as much as this one, and I won't break that habit in this review. I have written lots of reviews on amazon, but there are few things that I can recommend higher than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Many individuals don't like \\"following the trend\\" and reading/watching/listening just because the majority is doing the same exact thing, but this work is extraordinary and if you don't take the ride of reading this art, you will be doing yourself a great disservice.<br /><br />One of the greatest pieces of literature I have ever read.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B000005J56|4.0|This album is superb. If I could listen to this cd all day I would! If you enjoy this kind of music then I highly suggest you also purchase Angel Melendez and the 911 Mambo Orchestra's cd.It is absolutely superb.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I am pretty sure the wiggle is meant to establish a dreamlike state but it hurt my eyes after awhile. Other than that it was a great way to put together a set of interviews on pertinent questions by some great contemporary philosophers. This has certainly become a movie students like and tell their teachers about. So it must be good.
0060825219|5.0|The Zahir is probably the best book by Coelho. Mature, dealing with his own celebrity and talking openly about a History that people insist to hide from us. And, above all, talking about the force that moves stars and planets: love.
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|...backdrop for the final segment of SFU.  Kudos to the music producers of the show for making this choice and to SIA for creating such a beautiful, heart-wrenching song.  I am a new fan.
B00005JNTX|4.0|\\"Sin City\\" is a brutal and violent film.  It's a noirish look at a sprawling Metropolis, rampant with corruption, greed, gore and sex.  Just try and resist it.  Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) fuses the blunt brutality with a bold and breathtaking style, propelling the story through three loosely related subplots, connected mainly through their shared theme of the exploration of the dark and feral side of humanity.  \\"Sin City\\" grabs you by the throat and rarely loosens its' grip for the next two hours.  If its' a story about a hulking murderer (a mesmirizing Mikey Rourke) on a rampage to avenge the women who showed him a moment of kindness, you're engrossed.  If its' a story of a loner (Clive Owen) looking to help a gang of violent prostitutes from the mob, you're hooked.  If its' a story of a beaten down cop (Bruce Willis) looking to prtect a young woman (Jessica Alba) from a depraved and deformed sexual deviant, you're glued to the screen.   Rodriguez wisely chose to frame the films' visual style around Millers' original drawings and kept Millers' pulpy dialouge intact, which exposes the stories' wounded heart better than any screenwriter could have done.   And even though the film sometimes gets bogged down in its' own visual inventiveness, you will be floored again and again.
B00000K31V|3.0|If you like a sick movie, with no conventional ideas, this is it.<br /><br />Has a good director, and a god casting, even when its an old movie with low budget, but i recomend it like a cult movie for your sci fi colection.<br /><br />close to a B-movie<br /><br />have fun
B00028HBKM|5.0|I know others have said how horrible and sick this film was...  but so is scourging and torture and crucifiction.  That is what the Romans did in those times.  According to the scriptures, Christ's scourging was actually worse than depicted on film.  I am a Christian and have read and continue to read the Word of God regularly.  The public audience could not take everything that was done to Him.  This film made me weep for Christ and what He volunteered to do for me and for ALL of mankind on the cross.  No, it's too graphic for children but they do not need to see this film.  Thay have not grown up and become untrusting, skeptical, wounded and guarded as adults can be.  I cannot say i loved this film because as i heard one man say... \\"it's like watching someone you love being tourted for two hours\\".  But it was very well made and it touched me.  i highly recommend it as a reminder of what Christ went through for ALL of us.
B000957O82|4.0|I watched this movie on a whim in a hotel room a while back, and it turned out to be a nice little romantic comedy. It tries a bit too hard to feel like Jerry Maguire (there is even a scene where one of the characters is watching the famous \\"You complete me\\" scene), but Will Smith is admirable in the lead as a \\"date doctor\\" who encounters a little trouble when trying to find love himself. A movie like this does not require much analysis, except to say that it is well-crafted and there are a few funny moments, especially in some of the scenes with co-star Kevin James. One thing it excels at is defying most of the cliches of your standard Hollywood rom-com. The ending is a little hackneyed, but by that time the film had endeared itself to me so much that I didn't care.  <br /> <br />
0385338686|4.0|This was a great book... very sweet and funny.  If you like to know what happens with an epilogue there's none here.  That is the only thing that i would have changed.   <br />Very similar to 'can you keep a secret?' instead of the shopahoic books.   <br />Loved the characters and the story.
B0007M22TI|3.0|I saw the show on PBS which was closed captioned with the words to the songs underneath.  I bought the DVD thinking I could learn the words to the songs but found it has no subtitles so you cannot see the words on the screen - and the liner notes also have no lyrics.  I have not been able to find out if the CD has liner notes with lyrics.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I have not actually listened to this album, and I can't see myself doing so in the future on the sole basis that the album's first single, \\"Speed of Sound\\", has the IDENTICAL chord progression to Coldplay's last radio-saturating single, \\"Clocks\\", transposed to a different key. I would never be able to see this move by Coldplay as anything other than a contrived attempt to capitalize on the pop-music audience's ridiculous predisposition to buying whatever sounds familiar, or even identical, to whatever they are already listening to. It's a credit to any group that can pull of creating a hit song, but to abuse the notoriety that comes along with it by immediately regurgitating the song back into the market under a different title is shallow. For people like me who are interested in the historic context of music, this creates feelings of contempt, feelings that aren't alleviated by the obvious \\"Bends\\" influenced style of music Coldplay is already milking. It's one thing to expand on influences, but to wallow in them and recycle them over and over again is simply lame.
B0009K7QZ8|3.0|Somehow, the actors and even worse the writers comes across as really being up themselves. Since it's succes in it's first season, they know they're all that - and it's full of playing on things they 'know' works.  <br />Despite the unique chemistry between Seth and Summer, the season just fails to deliver, again. And the irritating 'harp incidental music' which tells us a scene is supposed to be funny, just grates once you notice how it's just placed on top of an otherwise humorless and dull storyline.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Pay no attention to the FEW and far between bad comments about this band and this box set. Jealousy is a nasty bug. This box set rocks! Just like the band does. If you don't like the set, fine...just say you don't like. Don't act like a child and call names and show your low iq. Just say it isn't your type of music or you didn't care for it. As far as this long time Jovi fan is concerned...it absolutely rocks!!!!! <br /> <br />Finally a band that doesn't just make a box set of all the songs you have already heard! WOW!
B0000020C4|4.0|I truly enjoyed this recording. It's billed as the \\"Dream Cast\\", and despite the conspicuous absence of Anthony Warlow, that's not exactly an empty boast: all of the principals give terrific performances (Philip Quast being perhaps the best of the lot), and the whole record gets a boost from the extra energy that is often present in live recordings (though listening to the audience applaud after death scenes is more than a little disconcerting). The main reason that I took one star off was because this is an incomplete recording-how much better it would have been if it had been the full show! This is definitely worth the price.
B000002ILG|5.0|I agree with everyone here, Vito (White Lion's guitartist) is  phenomenal on this album. I don't play guitar but know enough that the work on this album, especially on 'hungry' and 'don't give up' is unbelievably great and you'll never get tired of listening to these tracks. The first time I heard White Lion I was listening to every other hair band in the Eighties. But when I heard this album, the hair on my neck stood up due to the sheer complex and intricate style Vito brings to these otherwise simple songs. If you like George Lynch of Dokken, the get this album if only for the incendiary guitar solos.
B000002I53|5.0|I put off buying this heralded album for a while because of a slightly irrational bias towards the title cut.  Could even the great John Coltrane rescue the song from \\"The Sound of Music\\" that has become a theme song for the insipid and bland? As everybody else already knew, the answer is an emphatic \\"yes.\\"  Coltrane loses none of the joy of the original, and actually increases it. His virtuoso playing reaches new emotional depths, showing that one need not infantilize a song to express pure childlike glee.  Although the players give the album a generally unified sound--accessible but experimental, light and joyful yet emotionally dense--I review the cuts individually below.  Truly an outstanding album, recommended for jazz newcomers and veterans alike, and probably the best introduction to the post-1950's Coltrane, when the man really began his own \\"new thing.\\"<br /><br />My Favorite Things<br /><br />Pianist McCoy Tyner sets the pace and mood for Coltrane's lead sax. \\"Trane\\" gradually modifies the initial theme by varying the tone and note selection. Tyner trades leads on the main motif, and then, after experimenting with differently paced note repetitions, he gives the melody several twists--close to the original, but considerably fresher.  Coltrane returns with a stronger, more confident reading, as if he and the band, having paid homage to the familiar, are now free to do their own thing. Coltrane blows long strings of notes, sometimes pinching them (a little like Jackie McClain) and, at other times, cascading the sounds like raindrops.  Elvin Jones' tapping drums and Tyner's insistent piano add to this rainfall effect; one wonders whether precipitation is one of their favorite things.  Finally, Coltrane finishes with a glorious twisting profusion of notes, spinning around his backing and ending on a tone of celebration and renewal. The playing is not overtly spiritual, but it has a similar effect. Though the song is not at all \\"difficult,\\" it's definitely a great introduction for the Coltrane initiate.<br /><br />Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye<br /><br />Over a languorous background that recalls the Bill Evans trio, Coltrane plays this ballad with sensitivity and lyricism.  Tyner enters with a truly beautiful solo that emphasizes long strings of notes and superb chord dynamics.  I'm really quite taken with the shimmering quality of the piece, another rainy day atmospheric piece that deeply interplays dark and light moods.<br /><br />Summertime<br /><br />The band takes a more swinging, bold, and muscular approach. Coltrane reaches upwards with strong, rapid fire phrases, bassist Steve Davis is all over the map,  Jones adds boppish drum accents, and Tyner combines his percussive and melodic powers. Coltrane's at the forefront, however, his pure, from-the-gut blowing giving the cut its power and heart.  Tyner and JOnes continue in this strong, imaginative manner with superb bop playing.  Davis finally has a bass solo, his thoughtful playing bursts with creative impulse (although an appreciation of the bass and repeated listening will yield the greatest rewards). Later, Chambers duos with Jones  (sounding like Max Roach, but with fewer pyrotechnics) in an interesting, although not essential section. Coltrane closes the piece with some fierce playing, before leading the song briefly back to the melody.<br /><br />But Not for Me<br /><br />This has one of the most original opening riffs of modern jazz; it's like the famous Gillespie opening to \\"All the Things You Are.\\"  Coltrane restates the opening theme with some flat notes and a tone that is both sad and defiant.  Overall, it has an unmistakable Coltrane sound, including his rapid, whirling notes. The approach is dissonant yet within harmonically reach of the melody.  In other words, he expresses the melody through finding notes that mesh harmonically.  At times, the riffs and even the melodic restatement sounds a bit like \\"A Love Supreme.\\" As always, the rhythm section, especially the driving bass, brilliantly propels the song. During Coltrane's sax journeys, Tyner punctuates the sound percussiony accents.  About midway through, he breaks into his own version of the theme, then takes off into a fluid--but hard-hitting and slightly abstract--solo that takes side trips along Coltrane's territory.  The outstanding main riff and overall approach appropriately darkens the Gershwin tune, so that the brooding message (\\"they're singing songs of love, but not for me\\") is less the playful punning of lyricist Ira Gershwin, and more an acknowledgement and resistance of love's disappointment.<br /><br />An album you'll play over and over again, with fresh insights and continued enjoyment each time.driving bass, brilliantly propels the song.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series has some of the best writing and acting I've ever seen on television.<br /><br />The characters are all extremely well developed and multifaceted.  The dialogue and action sequences are clever, well thought out, and serve the overall story.<br /><br />If you appreciate quality science fiction or quality television for that matter do yourself a favor and buy this DVD set.  You won't be disappointed.
0060589280|2.0|This book was heavily recommended to me by an entire horde of people, so I picked it up expecting truly colossal writing, plot, and shock value. In the first one hundred or so pages, I realized that I was fooled; I was reading little else besides a run-of-the-mill supermarket paperback with a more detailed nod to anatomy.<br /><br />The book begins as a satire, which is refreshing. Coehlo doesn't take his heroine seriously, and regularly emphasizes just how pitiful, little, and self-indulgent she is. But somewhere in the middle, his amusing passat changes directions - and form - into downright self-righteous verbal trepanning. As the book progresses, we are supposed to feel more empathy towards Maria, an essentially unlikable character.<br /><br />Coehlo's attempts to philosophize about sex and love also emerge as inadequate. It is enough to watch one quality romcom or even listen to the zeitgeist to arrive at the same conclusion that he arrives at after needless reiteration.<br /><br />And redundancy is perhaps the book's most annoying feature. Coelho sees it his duty to repeat everything three or four times, often of a very predictable motif, such as that the protagonist misses her beloved when they are apart.<br /><br />I'm sure this book had incredible potential, but Coelho's zeal to write something \\"deep\\" about sex was what destroyed it. And I'm sure that if not for all the unnecessary interjections of \\"philosophy,\\" it would've been a hundred pages shorter and a few times better.
B0001LJC2K|3.0|On \\"Absolution,\\" mopey electric piano and opulent synth bass play tag team with the sometimes ludicrously fuzzed-out guitar of also-vocalist Matt Bellamy. And what a voice! Enough polling will yield descriptions ranging from \\"Buckley-esque\\" to \\"reminds me of that time I accidentally drove a nail through both my testicles.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Absolution\\"'s sound has a lot more to do with the songwriting and aural tricks of Showbiz, Muse's nearly universally derided debut (at least in the tiny universe in which elitist \\"they sound like Radiohead\\" Pitchfork-goers exist), with few nods to the spacey \\"Queen Bowie\\" sound they cultivated on 2001's \\"Origin of Symmetry.\\" \\"Absolution\\" is equal parts bombast and balls-in-a-vice balladeering, and this has served to land them a new wave of Radiohead comparisons even after absolving themselves with the interesting fusion of styles on \\"Symmetry.\\" <br /> <br />Since we're still sort of on the subject of testicles, who was it, exactly, that managed to get Bellamy by the balls long enough to convince him to use the godawful studio harmonizer at all? If the foppish orchestral plod of certain tunes here doesn't make you \\"Blackout,\\" you won't have to worry about being prematurely jolted out of the drool on your desk by the Scooby Doo outtake pre-choruses on \\"The Small Print.\\" Hearing Bellamy harmonize with his obviously digitally-manipulated, down-pitched self comes with a cheese factor that has to be higher than in a Mexican restaurant during lunch rush. <br /> <br />Elsewhere, \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" steals the thundering mojo of \\"Dead Star\\" (see Muse's b-side collection, \\"Hullaballoo\\"), throwing in even more nu metallish, overdistorted guitar for good measure. On the strength of its power guitarring, it has the most potential of any of Absolution's tracks to become a single aside from \\"Hysteria,\\" the record's best tune. <br /> <br />Additionally, the slow, more synth-laden tracks like \\"Endlessly\\" and \\"Time Is Running Out\\" show the band's flair for the coolly dramatic, even if \\"Endlessly\\" is basically the same ballad we heard on \\"Unintended\\" with dorkier instrumentation. \\"Time is Running Out\\" is a fingersnapper that propels its way into anthem territory for the chorus. <br /> <br />While a cult following will undoubtedly remain, \\"Absolution\\" is an absolute misnomer; Muse's inconsistency on this third album does more to incriminate than acquit. \\"Showbiz\\" fans might find something to like here, and the crossover potential from dancey synthwork is undeniable, but this record doesn't come close to challenging, let alone surpassing, the lofty goals and watermarks set by the stratospheric \\"Origin of Symmetry.\\" It's unfortunate, but it's clear that Bellamy still has his head on straight as far as technical prowess goes, and \\"Hysteria\\" is undoubtedly one of the best songs that will ever get played on commercial radio. As a mixed bag, I'm giving it 3 stars, or, as Amazon clarifies, \\"It's OK.\\"

B0006Z2KYI|4.0|The place is Warsaw, Poland just before the Nazi blitzkrieg. A troupe of actors is preparing for a new show. They are all hams of the first order. A young polish flyer is infatuated by the famous actress and she is flattered by his attentions. All of this falls away as the Nazis invade.<br /><br />The actors must now be very careful of how they portray the German overlords. The flyer has escaped to fight with the British. The Polish underground stirs up trouble.<br /><br />So far, this would seem like any war drama from that day and age but things get complicated when a Nazi agent in London gets the names of the underground people back in Warsaw. Included in the names is that of the actress, played by Carol Lombard. Her Flyer and would be paramour wants to send her a message by way of the agent, whom he believes to be a loyal Pole. When his treachery is found out, a mission is mounted to stop him before he can deliver the names to the Gestapo. Before it's over, all of the actors get involved playing German officials and even the Fuhrer himself as they try to control the damage.<br /><br />Jack Benny plays the leader of the Polish acting troupe. He is plagued with Nazis, his wife and her flyer as well as his Polish nationalism. It is a situation ripe with comedy and drama. It is a fun movie.
0060989157|5.0|The book The Dirt IS really the dirt. How these guys remember all the stuff that is in the book is amazing- because of all the drugs and partying they did. But aside from the sex, drugs, and rock n roll that is Motley Crue, Nikki, Vince, Mick and Tommy spill endless details of their personal lives. Its obvious why the teachers dont hand it out in schools but they really should, but probably only in high school or college.  This is a book that tells you basically what not to do. I give the Motley guys so much credit for putting all theese accounts on paper. I am a huge Crue fan and I loved this book, but even if you are not a Motley Crue fan, this book is DEFINITLY worth reading!!
B00008H2LB|3.0|this album isn't bad. i bought it mainly because i knew of atleast 3 good singles that they had released off of it. They're all good songs, but it seems that almost every song has the same kind of sound to it. and that gets boring after a while. oh well, judge for yourself.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I thought this album is one of the best put out in the past few years. Gavin DeGraw has such raw talent, it's not doctored up like other artists. He's not afraid to show grit and I love that in an artist. <br />Perhaps the best song on the album is \\"Belief\\". This song could be such a huge hit, just like \\"I Don't Want To Be\\" was. It has so much soul and love put into it. A song like this can really move a person. <br />Another favorite is \\"Chemical Party\\". The catchy chorus really gets stuck in your head. And the lyrics are quite interesting if you really listen to them. That song always makes me kind laugh because I think everyone knows someone like the girl in the song. <br />So in closing I would reccomend that if you haven't thought about getting it, think again. It will be money very well spent. And while you're at it pick up Chariot:Stripped.
0060930187|4.0|Plath's story may leave you with the sense that a sane and healthy mind is much more of a fragile thing than you expected.  By turns entertaining, funny, dark, and poetic; Plath's writing infuses her character with genuine humanity.  She allows us a unique insight into an unwell mind.  Strangely enough, I often found myself cracking a slow smile as I read the thoughts of a completely rational character whose descent into insanity seemed so natural and reasonable.
0739313126|5.0|The one thing to remember in reading this book audio or hard copy  is it's a Novel not a documentary. The author has done an excellent  job of making forgotten history interesting although his interpretation of the facts are for dramatic purposes.<br />I dare say more people will have an indepth opinion on the works of<br />Leonardo da Vinci than ever before.<br /><br />Also I will say this I found it a little odd that Dan Brown's murder victim<br />had to rearrange his own crime scene and remove his clothes just to leave a simple clue. Ever heard of a note.
B00006AUIG|2.0|Well, I ordered this DVD after I read a promising review on a horror movie website that I trust.  I was actually kind of let down by this movie.  The location was incredible, but that's about all I got out of it.  I mean, I was expecting a fair amount of chills to crawl up my spine, and I got none, and I mean NONE!  It's got a decent plot, but it drags on for too long and is just not what I expected.  Also, this movie took place in way too much daylight, which killed the suspense for me.  Things just really aren't that scary when the sun is shining.  I wish I could have made a film in that location, because at least I could have made a film that was actually creepy.
