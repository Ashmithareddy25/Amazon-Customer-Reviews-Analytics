EVEN FIGHT HIS BABY BROTHER. NOTHING LIKE GETTING EVEN AND BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF FAMILY AND GETTING PAID FOR IT.... I WISH I COULD DO THAT LOL JK
B0035Q4AFC|4.0|Great family movie. 10 and older. Probably not for action movie addicts. Lots of teachable moments, such as WWI, WW2 and McCarthyism.
B00BVYLBP2|3.0|The show has a  very good premise. Perhaps I need to watch more episodes to give it a fair chance.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show gets me and my husband laughing. We absolutely loved coming home and watching this together. Really makes the end of the day a treat.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Being a baby boomer, I've been a fan of Star Trek since the series first aired. I love the new series and found this to be very engaging.
B00338QENI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! The author did a wonderful job weaving the family story and history together. I really enjoyed it.
B00EVLU2F2|4.0|Goldfrapp moves away from the synth-sounds of Head First back to a sound more reminiscent of Felt Mountain with Tales Of Us.  Longtime fans should enjoy this album.  Those new to the band should start with Supernature or Felt Mountain.  Alison Goldfrapp's sensual voice steals the show as usual.
B00F91H666|3.0|Another Zombie flick ... and I wanted much more powerful aliens! If it had been Aliens destroys earth then everybody I know would have been informed.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|An incredibly good teen movie that appeals to all ages. Someone will argue about that but think about it, it's true as it ticks all the teen boxes.
B00E3D7WGU|1.0|Fans of Madonna who have watched the actual MDNA world tour live will undoubtedly be disappointed in the sound on this release. I saw her show in Copenhagen and it sounded nothing like the audio on this release. How can I describe the sound? Madonna's vocals are mixed way too loud, the music seems to burried deeply in the mix with a lot of instrumentation missing and audience noise is rather loud. This leads me to believe that the mastering went wrong. I suspect the center channel was mixed with rear surround channels and omitted the actual front channel sound - to create a faulty stereo mix. Using Dolby Surround on the stereo mix pretty much confirms this: the center channel is loud and contains the vocals (as it should) - however the left and right front speakers are very, very low. Nothing comes from the rear speakers.<br /><br />This is not a bashing of the actual show or the sound quality at the actual shows but this CD is not mastered correctly.<br /><br />If you want to hear how it really should sound, look at youtube for Madonna's performance at the L'Olympia.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|The music never fails to take me back to the 70's. Brilliant piece of light entertainment and easy to class as a favourite
B00009XITP|5.0|Amanda Bynes is one of my favorite actress. I have played this movie so much, I might have to purchase another one soon.
1439102813|5.0|Excellent! Read in one day and passed on to my 83y/o Mother caring for my 85y/o Father with Alzheimer's to read .
B000I3PERS|5.0|One of the best movies that I have seen in my life, very simple an natural, I felt that I'm living with them. This movie is full of sensation and a lot of passion especially in the sorrow scenes and similarly in the romance moments.<br />I appreciate Mel Gibson for his make and I am will to see other movies that he has roles in them.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|great movie... usually just download but just wanted a hard copy of this movie...love it the author/writer actors ...just love this romance!

B009EEFTMC|2.0|Not a fan of this version of the game! I have played this game on line and I loved it! This version is not fun for me anyway, but my 5 yr old loves it!
9382951008|4.0|I liked this book but less than the first other two by Hosseini. He is at his best when he writes about Afghanistan. He is a great author in any case. I am looking forward to his fourth book!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|If you did not know when this was written, you would not know how old it is.  It is very thought provoking and engaging.  I strongly recommend it.
0345803493|5.0|Read the first book and love it so I knew I had to read this one and I am loving it and the shipping was very fast!!!
B00DJ80VLS|1.0|This is what I said on my review on ADTOE regarding Mike Portnoy - \\"I agree, Mike Portnoy is right after all! Regardless of the selfish notion that he wants to hold the group on a leash, I believe he was trying to steer the DT boat to a right direction by asking them to have a hiatus and regroup after a few years. Rather than looking at that perspective, JP and the gang went to the more route of glamour, success and more self destructing ways of composing music.\\"<br /><br />I still stand on what I said and bluntly speaking, Dream Theater is needing some bad R&R pronto!!<br /><br />I just listened to the entire album and boy, this latest and worse, their self-titled album, does not deliver at all!<br /><br />There's only one thing they would have to do: Either dissolve or continue spiraling out of control with too much obscure prog-rock music they make!!<br /><br />Seriously, all members of the band really need to think SOLO projects instead of making songs that doesn't fit and even hurt the brand name.<br /><br />Far Worse, Mike Portnoy and his Dad (who did named the band), i feel, is terribly insulted by this music!<br /><br />(Just to let you know, Mike Mangini did deliver here in this album. The mics for his drumkit are horrible. I can barely hear the drums well)
B0091W10TS|5.0|Not many movies depict hell or demons and this one really delivers! A visually stunning movie with a great plot.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Enjoyed watching it for the 2nd time- the T. Rex scenes are gripping!<br />A great family pick for those dull Sat nights!
B005ES0Z9O|5.0|The fit is as expected and I love the traction sole which gives me great stability on wet/muddy surfaces. Highly recommend them.
1455523550|5.0|By far my favorite Nicholas Sparks book.  I read it in like 2 days and couldn't put it down.  Just loved it!  Then the movie came out and I did love the movie too but it is just nooo where near as good as the book, but isnt that always the case?  I'd recommend this book to anybody!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Amazing! Really loved it. Had a book hangover for days. Looking forward to reading more of Gillian's books. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Such an instant classic!  HIghly talked about by so many people I know.  Bought this set as a gift for my mom - who is a huge fan.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I just had my Monkey Lights put on today, and rode with them for the first time tonight. They are great. Even at low speeds they are still visible. I heard one person say how cool my lights were as I drove by, and the LBS who installed them for me said they wished they had more time to play with them, as this was the first set they had every installed and they loved them.<br /><br />All in all, a great purchase!
B00BQOC4X0|3.0|Jared Diamond has done some very original fieldwork and raises some interesting questions. If you want to read this to find out a mass of facts about different civilizations, your money is well spent. However, the book's central question of why civilizations or cultures collapse cannot be answered purely by geographical observations, and Diamond ends up bogged down in details. Notably lacking was any in-depth psychological perspective. Diamond comments on people's actions, whether wise or self-defeating, as based on rational choices, as in the so-called tragedy of the commons, a variation on the prisoner's dilemma. As an antidote to this lack of insight into human behaviour I would recommend George Devereux's Mohave Ethnopsychiatry, an account of a traditional view of the human soul in which different types of suicidal set-up are an expected outcome in certain situations. And as for why the Easter Islanders cut down the last tree, has no-one considered the possibility that they used the last ones for boats in a doomed attempt to find more land?
B00F2362IE|3.0|While I so appreciate how EASY it is to purchase videos/ books on my kindle fire, my nephew was just tapping the touch screen over and over which is how I ended up with $14 in purchases I didn't approve. I think Amazon should be more like Apple iPhone in that an apple password is required to download any application, even FREE ones.<br /><br />Thank you.
020530902X|5.0|Times are changed. The way we produce information is different. Keep pace with the time and find out the new elements of style. They change all the time. I love the way the authors keep pace with time and are not dinosaurs advocating the old fashioned method is the best when it is long gone. Technology is always going to be an exciting challenge. That is the point of advancing and learning. What is your style? What is your element? This book is also a must have on your shelf as a reference book. I refer to it all the time. The authors of this book got it right, they moved into the timeless mode that actually moves forward with the changes of our time.
B001V5ADS2|5.0|Repetitious...not the show...anything that I could say. I watch hardly any \\"fiction\\" TV and don't pay attention to reviews or hype so I completely missed this series until only a couple of months before the final episode. Even the less-than-outstanding episodes in Seasons 1 & 2 have left me scratching my head about how anyone could write and produce something so well. In any event, congrats to the cast, director, writers, crew, etc. for a well-earned \\"Best\\" in many Emmy categories. Oh...this is the first and only video I have watched on my nearly-obsolete Kindle Fire -- and it's been ideal for me. I particularly like the ability to easily stop, rewind, pause, re-watch -- whatever -- without having to mess with a remote. 'nuf said.
B000SVZIDA|1.0|tried desperately to watch this even went threw the over the phone consumer help line and still nothing worked. the movie was never able to have been watched

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Exciting enough to be a fast read, cerebral enough not to just be a mindless thriller.  Especially poignant are the emotions which flow through the first person narrative, combined with the cold analytical grand jury transcript. Very well done and highly recommended.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|Enjoyed the story lines and the different situations. Surprizes all the time  lolling forward to the next season. Thank you

B0067TQQI8|5.0|I've had the Astro2 8400 for a couple months now.  Many flights and trips later, and the device still works great.  It can easily do 4-5 full charges on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  It is small enough to be convenient, but a bit too large for pocket use.<br /><br />One attribute I think is great, is while using the 'lower' powered charging port, I can watch a movie on my phone and the device will still accumulate a charge.<br /><br />I haven't tried the 2 amp port, only because I've heard the GS3's can get very hot when using rapid chargers.<br /><br />I've already recommended the Astro2 8400 to a couple coworkers who travel frequently.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|OMG finally! I have been waiting for this for far too long! Keeping it true to their style, welcome back old friend!
B00F52YOPA|5.0|We play a lot of hidden object games and generally love them all.  We have played many from Tamalaki and again they were very fun.  This one though is an entirely new level of game.  A meaningful story, tons of game modes and a nice match3 minigame.  I particulary like how you build up the room with the money you make.  It's a lasting piece of progress as you play through the game!
B00F91G5BS|3.0|It took me 3 hours to watch this movie because the amazon serber was up and down so I kinda lost interest. Was going to try to watch Ironman 3 last night and the same thing on the trailer. So I watched it on VUDU instead with no problems.

B002N44XSG|5.0|I was waiting for the last Olympian when suddenly I found this. I idmeadiatly craked this open and started reading. I was SO amazed. The fictional character portraits were stunning. (Annabeth looked exactly how I imagined her to look :D) And all three stories were different, but fit together perfectly. Can't wait for TLO!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have enjoyed all three seasons and watch the DVDs over and over again.  I am hooked on Downton Abbey!
1451629192|5.0|Really amazing memoir. The author really gives us insight into her 18 year kidnapping (also many images of herself when she was a little girl) and tells the reader how she felt and what occurred from the day she went missing to the day she was found alive. In the ending, the author talks about therapy with horses and its very interesting though some might find it boring when the end gets near. Very emotional, truly a bestseller. The author is very admirable and demonstrates her will to survive. I personally like when she says she is not a victim because she survived an impossible situation. The author is strong and the few people who I personally admire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It lived up to the hype.  I couldn't tell where the story was going and it was nicely written.  It's a page turner!

B0092S4WLY|4.0|This app can be fun and frustrating.  There should be a way to activate hints.  Otherwise, it's too easy to give up and move on to the next app.
B005SAXZYU|5.0|This is the story of a warlord whose dying wish is to have his clan kept in power by having an impersonator take on his role after his death. The wish is fulfilled, with unforeseeable results. A fantastic exploration of the ephemeral nature of power. It cries out for a modern-day remake.<br /><br />This version is the one on which George Lucas and Coppola share a credit for &#34;executive producer of the international version&#34;. They were involved in preparing and distributing the subtitled print in the US, I think.<br /><br />Amazon: please make more Kurosawa movies available!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best puzzle app I have played.  Keeps you thinking and looking for clues. Can't wait for more, great way to relax after a stressful day.

B00E0G5S20|5.0|This is the album that should have come after Heartwork.  While I do enjoy Swansong and it remains one of my favorite Carcass albums, it wasn't a very good follow up to Heartwork.  Surgical Steel starts out with a really cool intro track and from there rips into a grinding death metal (melodic at times) masterpiece.  Track number 6 has one of the greatest song intro riffs I've heard in quite a while.  The production is killer and the guitar tone is huge and crushing.  I didn't expect much out of this album.  Most come back albums are typically luke warm efforts at best, but this.......this here is something special folks.  Easily one of my top 3 albums of the year.
0800184327|5.0|Recently I discovered  that I really enjoy Salsa dancing and many other styles of Latin dancing too. Not knowing what this tape would be like -- I took a chance. The story line is Fine, and the dancing IS SUPER. I really enjoyed watching it, and have watched it many more times since, and I'm certain that I will enjoy it for many years to come.
B0094M0DJS|5.0|For the money I've spent on pay per view on this movie, I should have just bought the DVD.  Either way, there are few movies that I can think of that make me want to watch them months later.  Or even think of them.  This is one of those movies that occasionally float back into my mind and make me want to watch again.<br /><br />Hollywood didn't treat this movie very well, but Aaron Eckhart plays a great character and it's a good action flick.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried throughout this entire novel. Simply a beautiful story about the purity of love and the finality of life. It will make you realize what is important in life and have you hugging your loved ones.

B0097HSS4M|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it was a bit slow to respond but that is probably my connection. I had a good picture of my husband and I and all the grandkids. I was able to crop it and enhance the clarity.  I have no skill in this area. This is going to make pictures even more fun to share. Thanks for the memories.

B002GIBVV6|5.0|By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com<br /><br />The best by far of any amazon.com reviews of The Secret Garden (no matter which version you like best) was made by Lloyd Newell September 22, 2013 on the Church of the Air, Music and the Spoken Word broadcast from Temple Square in Salt lake City, Utah. This was Newell's review:<br /><br />Over a hundred years ago, Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote The Secret Garden, an enchanting novel about a young girl, Mary, who is orphaned during a cholera outbreak and sent away to live with relatives she has never met. Her childhood has been filled with loneliness and neglect, but Mary's personality begins to blossom as she and a young gardener bring new life to an old, neglected garden.<br /><br />Though the garden seems to be nearly dead, the gardener helps Mary see the dormant life in it, which together they nurture to full bloom. The garden becomes a place of healing not only for Mary but also for others who are suffering--including her sickly cousin and her sorrowing uncle.<br /><br />It is a reaffirming, hopeful message of the resilience of life--that people can change, miracles can happen, and everyone's story can have a happy ending.<br /><br />In a sense, we each have a secret garden that needs tending. It might be a relationship that needs a little extra care, a decision that needs to be made, a hope or a wish or a dream that needs some nurturing. Our garden may seem to be filled with weeds and thorns, but it is also filled with the potential to become lush and fragrant and beautiful. Even when life seems dark and hopeless, with some patient care and attention, things can always change for the better.<br /><br />In the Broadway adaptation of The Secret Garden, a friendly chambermaid uplifts Mary during a moment of discouragement with this inspiring message:<br /><br />When you see the storm is coming,<br />See the lightning part the skies,<br />It's too late to run--<br />There's terror in your eyes!<br />What you do then is remember<br />This old thing you heard me say:<br />\\"It's the storm, not you,<br />That's bound to blow away.\\" . . .<br />Hold on, Hold on.<br />The night will soon be by.<br />Hold on<br />Until there's nothing left to try.<br />Child, hold on.<br />There are angels on the way!<br />Hold on and hear them say, \\"Child, Oh, child!\\" . . .Hold on!<br /><br />See all of my Reviews.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I rate \\"Hachi, A Dog's Tail\\" one of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />The film itself was beautiful, including the segments reflecting Hachi's view of things.  The setting (Woonsocket RI) was wonderful - I even stopped by to see the station when I was in the area in May.  The actors were very, very good.  They probably made the movie because they knew it was a great story, while recognizing that it would not be a blockbuster financially.  The message related to loyalty is extremely compelling. Finally, the music was outstanding.<br /><br />While most people like Hachi, the movie has some critics that don't seem to understand a couple of the issues related to the story.<br /><br />First, this is an Americanized version of something that actually happened in Japan.  Most cultures actually have stories of the eternally loyal dog, and these stories are based on fact.  They are inspirational. My point, though, is that since this is a true story, it had to be told pretty much as it happened.  Hachi actually did live life as what we'd call a stray, in Tokyo in the 1920's.<br /><br />Second, as must have been the case certainlly with the true Hachi, our Hachi was in fact taken care of by the people who knew him in the area around the train station.  This was not a case of Hachi going it alone, digging through dumpsters for scraps to survive.  It is a tribute to the community, which was intensely loyal to Hachi.  It was reflected well in the sequence in which Jasjeet tells Ken that the people around the station would always take care of Hachi, even to taking up a collection for Hachi if he needed medical help.  This is hardly a story of some abandoned dog.  And, keep in mind that we're talking about an Akita, a big and hearty dog that's not going to freeze in a New England winter.<br /><br />Third, I would have to agree that the adults in Parker's family were flawed, but that's consistent with what happened with the real Hachi, who was left in the care of Ueno's gardner.In the movie, Kate pretty much fell apart after Parker's death.  Andy had so much going on in her life, and probably didn't know what to do for Hachi.  I wouldn't have turned Hachi loose, personaly, but I have a different perspective on my dogs.  Remember, this is pretty much what happened to the real Hachi, so that was the story.  These people weren't evil, they were flawed - as we all are in some way.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe this movie to be monumental in its significance as a life lesson.  It is beautifully made and inspirational.  If you're going to show it to pre-teen kids, it might be a good idea to pre-view it yourself, and talk with the kids about it before having them watch it.
0062255657|5.0|I was worried when I saw how slim the book was. I needn't worried. It was perfect and Not A Kids Book.
B004BLTNM0|1.0|This is one of those films I used to go see as a budding philosophy graduate student in downtown Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon around 1:00 to blow off steam, along with Xtro, Cannibal Holocaust, The Thing and whatever else was showing. You know, the kind where half the audience is either stoned, asleep, drugged or recently released from Creedmore Asylum. Unlike fine wine, time has not aged this film for the better. What we have here would make Ed Wood roll in his grave it is so bad, so without drama, without acting, so without...redeeming value. I'd say pass it up or watch it on Netflix but don't part with your money for this shlock. And it is shlock.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|The author alternated from trying to discredit the truth of the New Testament and quoting  from it to support his claims. His goal seemed to be to make Jesus Christ seem to be more like a Muslim believer than the Savior, Son of God, Messiah, etc. that Christians believe.  I did not think it was a particularly scholarly work on the subject, but was rather aimed at the uninformed masses some of which are looking for any reason to question or even trash Christianity.  The stir that the book has created seems to indicate that he was successful at that.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Enjoyable to play - I haven't gotten very far into it, but it is good for passing the time.  I'm not in to it to the extent that I will pay for more coins.

140006922X|2.0|Writing a biography about Jesus is somewhat like writing a biography about Socrates. Both haven't left any written word, and the sources on both are fairly dubious. In Socrates' case, the main source is Plato, who probably used Socrates to convey his own views. In Jesus' case, we mostly rely on the Gospels that contain a very &#34;unhistorical&#34; account of Jesus.<br /><br />Aslan acknowledges that and states in the introduction that &#34;the task is somewhat akin to putting together a massive puzzle with only a few of the pieces in hand; one has no choice but to fill in the rest of the puzzle based on the best, most educated guess of what the completed image should look like.&#34;<br /><br />Aslan's main objective in this biography is to explore (one might say speculate) on Jesus the man, and not Jesus Christ the Messiah. In other words, Aslan is interested in who actually Jesus was and not all the hype that followed afterwards.<br />In this particular goal, I think Aslan failed miserably. Firstly, perhaps 80% of the book is focused on the TIMES of Jesus and not Jesus himself. Secondly, even the few pages that are devoted to Jesus are so speculative that it's hard to take them seriously. The fact that Aslan decided not to add footnotes doesn't help.<br /><br />Having said that, I did enjoy reading Aslan's interpretations of how the early church twisted and rewrote history in order to better fit its needs and beliefs. &#34;Jesus spoke about the end of days, but it did not come to pass, not even after the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and defiled God's Temple. He promised that God would liberate the Jews from bondage, but God did no such thing.&#34; And the list of unfulfilled prophecies goes on and on. &#34;The early church obviously recognized this dilemma...They mixed and matched the different depictions of the Messiah found in the Hebrew bible to create a candidate that transcended any particular messianic model or expectation.&#34; They basically wanted to createa Jesus that would have more appeal. This was also apparent in the &#34;theological enhancements&#34; of Jesus' death, which was probably a lot less &#34;Hollywoodic&#34; than the Gospels claim it to be.<br /><br />&#34;Zealot&#34; for the most part is plain speculation. Yet, it's fairly short and readable, and does offer an occasional interesting insight. So I guess it wasn't a complete waste of time.
0399159347|4.0|Thank you to the publisher and author for a copy of this novel via netgalley. (UK)<br /><br />My Darling Cecilia<br />If you're reading this, then I've died . . .<br /><br />The basis of this book being a letter discovered accidentally by Cecilia, it was an intriguing premise...just what did her Husband feel the need for her to know, should he die?<br /><br />Following several women (Cecilia, Rachel and Tess) in a multi stranded tale of love, life and the secrets we keep, this was a well written book, the kind I particularly like as you can't really see the connection between these three women at the start...until the author starts bringing it all together for you. An inital look would say they were three completely different people living three completely independant lives, but in a very six degrees of separation sense they are more connected than they realise...<br /><br />I loved the majority of this book - the slight downside being I did find it fairly obvious what the \\"secret\\" was - but because the heart of the story was more the fallout of discovery than the actual secret itself, this should not put you off at all...<br /><br />Some terrific characterisation (although personally I found Cecilia rather whiny!) and a fast flowing intimate look at the nuances of living day to day life especially when you are dealing with very real issues, this held my attention throughout. I thought the ending was particularly good and appropriate to the feeling of the book overall - so one satisfied reader here.<br /><br />Overall a well written, thoughtful novel and while there was nothing there that made me go \\"wow\\" I enjoyed it very much and will certainly read more from this author. A great book to curl up in bed with alongside a cup of hot chocolate. Comfort reading. I love it.<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!

B00563K3DA|4.0|The story is an easy introduction to eastern philosophy. The narrative is a bit cheesy, but you're reading for information. I enjoyed the Kindle edition with the ability to view passages that other Kindle readers have highlighted. It is an easy read with ideas that help you enjoy life and learn valuable lessons. Recommended.

B005OT2YVA|5.0|Very action filled & more transformers of course. This movie is about bringing Cybertron Planet to Earth. Thus making humans slaves or obliterating humans altogether. It takes Sam, Lennox, Epps & Simmons again to save Earth from the Decepticons. It starts with the Space Race in the 60's. When Armstrong (Apollo 11) sets foot on the moon. Their version is Kennedy & Nasa pushed this race to find out what landed on the moon. Armstrong & Aldrin explore the Dark Side of the Moon where the crash site of a spacecraft ended. They go home and we are taken back to present day. Autobots, Chernobyl, the Lunar walk all come together for the rest of the movie. New love interest in Sam's life does nothing for the Movie other than be &#34;arm candy&#34;.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|What is there to say?  Kings of Leon burst onto the mainstream scene with 'Only by the Night,' an excellent album of excellent sound and raw emotion.  Their last offering before Mechanical Bull, Come Around Sundown, was a pretty big departure for the band and was met with mixed reviews.  Although I personally liked it, I also feel it's their weakest album overall.<br /><br />I'm here to tell you that Mechanical Bull is a full on return to form for the Kings and that it is an excellent set of tracks.  Every song has a certain appeal to it and no two songs on the album really sound the same.  It's rare to have a band create what might be their masterwork so far into their career but, I have to say, this might be it.<br /><br />If you're a KoL fan, buy this album.  If you're on the fence, buy this album.  If you have any interest in blue grass/rockabilly/great sounding music, seriously, buy this album.  The only way I wouldn't recommend this album to you is if the band's sound simply didn't appeal to you at all.  Otherwise, this should be in your collection, without doubt.

B009LOJK1Q|3.0|Firstly - kudos to Mr King. As one of his early works The Shining has a mythical status of a classic from an era of horror that once was. Penning a sequel decades later is a challenge I don't envy.<br /><br />So the inevitable comparison: Dr Sleep is much more modern than The Shining, a sort of supernatural adventure, coming of age, redemption tale mixed into one. Where The Shining was the quintessential insanity inducing haunted hotel story, Dr Sleep reads more like a superhero story rather than an out and out horror.<br /><br />In common both tales are heavy on the gross style of scares (although that could be said about almost all Stephen King novels) and hinge strongly on the theme of violence caused by unnaturally induced insanity.<br /><br />The beginning of Dr Sleep was by far the strongest part of the book. King initially brings us up to speed on Dan Torrance, then introduces Abra as a next generation 'Shiner.' While the first few chapters lack a sense of direction and tension, just the vivid experiences of Dan's recovery and Abra's struggling family are enough to carry the novel, and when the True Knot are introduced they are freaking creepy.<br /><br />Somewhere about the middle of the book things started to stagnate, Dan's alcoholism becomes more of a token flaw as opposed to an important part of the story. Abra's difficulties with her psychic power are largely tamed, and the conclusion feels like the end of a lesser B grade action flick, it seems Mr King was too timid to hit us with a tragic or at least traumatizing finale and let things end without surprise or unfortunately any excitement.<br /><br />In total Dr Sleep is a good book, but will likely be remembered as just another Stephen King book rather than an equally classic piece as its predecessor.

B00F5FEZTC|5.0|Sir  Elton, like the best wine's, grows better with age. His last few albums - since Songs from West Coast, especially The Captain and the The Kid, have been great thoughrful records.<br />But it only with The Diving Board that Elton seems to have given up the \\"pop\\" sound for a purer piano based sound that matches well the more reflective lyrics and mature music. Brilliant and worth spending time with - great for close listening and reflection, as well as background bueatiful music.

B006RZFACU|5.0|When you are a kid, any change in weather is exciting. If you don't have to worry about driving in a fog (and kids don't!), then fog can become your own little playground. It's mysterious, \\"even the weatherman didn't really know why\\" it came over the town. And that's already funny to the kids -- an adult who cannot answer a question!<br /><br />Fog is different, and makes everything look unusual, providing plenty of opportunities for imaginative play. All adults are chiming in with their opinions, but nobody can explain what is going on, not the town historian, not the fire chief, and the town is immersed in hilarious chaos, with people mistaking each other for someone else, bumping into one another, and experiencing other kinds of confusion.<br /><br />Of course, eventually the fog clears, revealing a \\"beautiful sunny day.\\" A delightful story for young kids. Well-done!
B0031RS4UM|4.0|A typical Lee Child book featuring hero Jack Reacher with a good plot and action sequences, I enjoyed every page.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie had me guessing the whole time, the graphics and magic tricks were awesome. It reminded me of an old movie with Robert Redford and Paul Newman called the Sting , only this move is current century. Worth the money !<br />suntzzu
B006OFN0SE|4.0|My biggest problem with this DVD is that I couldn't play it in my DVD player. I had to play it on my computer. Had I known it only would play on my computer I would never have bought it. Other than that, it was an excellent movie and DiCaprio was brilliant.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting with many twists and turns.  I couldn't put it down....I was hoping for a different ending, but much like real life the ending wasn't at all what I thought it would be.  Great book....

B008JFLWLE|1.0|It dont allow u to fiinish writing before it tried to give answer which is wrong cause you weren't allowed to put in the whole question
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love reading Nicholas Sparks and in some cases the books start slow and it takes a while for the reader to submerge into the story. That was the only \\"fault\\" of this book. I watched the movie first and was excited to read the book.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Movie is a classic and a great lead in to the Avengers movie that would ultimately culminate from the separate character movies...a don't miss!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|It's worth the money! It's articulated in about every area imaginable. The paint is clean colorful and crisp and the figure is very detailed. The box came in perfect condition and so did the figure. I can't wait to get the other scouts, especially venus!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I have totally enjoyed British Drama and Comedy for decades... I found David Tennant's nuances as Dr Who fun and energetic acting and he has not disappointed in his exceptional acting ability portraying the character in this series.... actually the entire cast seems very well suited to their characters and have done a tremendous job of drawing the viewer in to the ever twisting  story line...
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Haven't really played it a lot t ok ma km e a good review into but it says I have to if I wanna carry on playing it, so I must be enjoying it for Mr to write the review.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Even worse than Snakes on a Plane. Brad looked grungy and weathered and an ill fit for an x-UN whatever. It's almost like he rolled out of bed after a few years and decided it was a good day to make a few more millions. Even though a SiFi, its premise was ridiculous nonetheless.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Speachless, utter amazment on how much i love this book &#60;3 It's full of action and mystery. YOU WON'T REGRET IT READ THIS
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|My family rented this to watch one night and overall the movie was an interesting take on the old classic. We had major internet issues the night of this movie so it took us 3.5 hours to watch the whole thing but my kids, ages 9 and 6, were glued to the movie the whole time.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Just a lovely experience!  Can't wait for next season! And many more seasons, for that matter! It's like reading a good novel!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Very good book!! Couldn't put it down!! The whole series was amazing and very well written. I bought them all!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This keyboard has been much easier to use than stock on my phone.  On the tablet not as easy but that could be hardware, darned new nexus 7! My one complaint, and it makes me mad,  is when I use non standard words or terms.  SwiftKey changes it automatically. Most time that's cool because I cannot spell for poop.  Other times it makes me want to kill the phone.  If you tell SwiftKey to use the word it remembers but sometimes it makes me see RED! For instance this last word I  all caps, SwiftKey is kind enough to default to only first letter capitalized when I really want all CAPS!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Awesome book!!..Really hope they get aroumd to making the rest of the movies soon!  Would love to see all the series brought to life.I saw the movie first but the books are very close
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is pretty fun. Its pretty awesome that its free too. Anyone who likes rpgs or action games would like this.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Wonderfully mindless fun. Unwind after work and challenge yourself.  3 levels to strive for on each play....not easy, but do-able.  Ads are minimal or between games. Just enjoy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Enjoyed playing. Nice graphics and storyline. Kept me interested in playing. Had a lot of fun with this in my spare time.
034580404X|5.0|I cant wait for the movie to come out.  Love the books and love who they have chosen for the cast.
B00DXP7L88|3.0|If you haven't seen the finale you should stop here. In my opinion all Dexter-seasons rank between very good and fantastic, including season 8. A good plot, turns and suspence through all episodes. But why do the showrunners have to come up with such a depressing ending ? I know, because it's finished, so they don't need to care about future viewer figures. Such an ending is far from  customerfriendly. Don't they care about their viewers ? The answer is simply NO. We see it in many TV-shows that producers and writers don't care (sometimes they make a cliffhanger even when they know that the show will be cancelled). And then this pseudo-psychological babbling from the producers (there is an interview in the net), that Dexter had to take the blame and the ultimate punishing. Death was too good for him, bla bla....<br />For me the weak link in this season was Debra. She messed everything up from the start. She even caused her own death, because she set the womanhunt\\" on Hannah in motion. Sorry to say, if anyone, then Deb got what she deserved. So why have the showrunners had to punish Dexter, Hannah and Harrison and by doing that punishing the greater part of their viewers (there are polls online) with an ending they don't like (which they knew). I like Dexter very much and have all the DVDs, but I make a stand and won't spend money on season 8. If people would do that more often, maybe the TV showrunners would think more customerfriendly in the future. But as long as they can do as they like and people will buy it anyway, why should they care as long as the money flows. I will take that all back for Dexter if they decide to produce a final final season or maybe a movie to wrap things up more anti-depressing (customer-friendly). 5 Stars for the Season, -10 Stars for the ending.<br />For those of us who'd like to have another season, there's a voting on screenrant com/dexter-season-9-discussion-preview/. For those who won't, stay away, you don't have to watch it, but don't have to spoil it for those who'd like it.
B0000DZEE3|1.0|.This dvd arrived with so many scratches that I had to keep fast forwarding it so I missed a lot of it.<br />I would appreciate it if you would sent me a new one.
B00F35BV64|5.0|It's ironic that Khan plays such an important part of this movie as well, but it really is a fun flick.  If you are a Star Trek fan I would have to think you will really like this movie.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I don't know why JT and Timba recycled material from previous albums and packaged it for this one, but it did not hit the soul.  I read an article that JT thought this was the best he's ever done.  It's not.  Besides having most tracks overextended (playing additional music that is not needed), this album lacked focus and depth.  Lyrically, it was not as focused and mature as previous works.  \\"Strawberry Bubblegum?\\" Really, JT?  You've produced so much better.  And I promise to leave alone \\"Mirrors\\" which sounds like a poor version of \\"What Comes Around.\\"<br /><br />I cannot rate 2 of 2 yet because Amazon won't let me, but it is leaps and bounds better than 1 of 1.  TKO, Murder, and Only When I Walk Away adds distinctive beats and lyrics that give you the impression that JT and Timba are truly creative artists.  The more out-of-R&B song was definitely the bluesy Drink You Away, the slower tempo Not A Bad Thing and personal favorite, Amnesia (deserves to be extended).
B00D6DVSAE|1.0|I think the album cover should say explicit lyrics on the cover as Jock the Singing Welder contains the \\"F\\" word a couple of times. It really did not sound right coming out of this classy guy's mouth, especially in its usage with God. I was very shocked and glad my children were not present when I was listening to the album. They know I have been a Sting fan since I was a child and I still am. I am just not a fan of this album. I really tried listening to it with an open mind and heart, reaching for that pure love that has drawn me to him through his previous work. And Yet was the only song that I really liked. If you want a cultural experience and to feel like you are listening to a musical sung in heavy accents, then you might enjoy this album. I highly recommend previewing it first on iTunes.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game will keep you motivated to better your score and beat your friends every week. Fun competition, very addictive!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It gives me a \\"time out\\" while my energy regenerates but I am always coming back for more! I totally enjoy it. Not to hard nor boring. Maybe the perfect hidden object game!<br /><br />shnnnw
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Just a fun, very watchable movie.  Enjoyable acting, moves fast but not too fast.  Thats all I really want to write
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I LOVE ALL THE BOOKS WITH HARRY HOLE. THEY ARE ALL EXCITING AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game. It is exciting to discover new rooms and gets more challenging the further you go. I am always up for a challenge. Everyone should give it a try.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I really like Fun, for the most part. Didn't realize there was profanity on this. Probably would've just bought the few songs I really wanted instead of the whole album, had I known that.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this App!! it totally diserves 5 stars from every review ( just wrighting so i could finish up the review)
B008NW67E0|1.0|As mentioned above, should've just gotten the song &#34;I Will Wait&#34;, not the whole album. Not a &#34;folk&#34; fan at all, which is the best I can think to explain this album. Nothing else on the album is really like &#34;I Will Wait&#34; - in my opinion anyway. Just my .02.  Music is so personal - just trying to help those out who like the &#34;I Will Wait&#34; - just buy that one.  Have a good day.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK I read it in 2 days and I don't like reading at all but I've heard a lot about this book and so I decided to buy it and I love it I couldn't stop reading I even cried and caught myself smiling a couple times<br />And it really made me really gratefully about the things I have and the people around me. I've already recommended this book to a couple of my friends
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Kinda liked this group, but actually really enjoyed seeing them perform (on tv), and have become a real fan now. Not sure who to compare them too, but good lyrics, and peppy - my opinion of course.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Had so much potential...  Everyone wants to take out zombee's...<br /><br />Spent a lot of money, did some neat special affects... but mindless zombee's?  Almost feel sorry for them...
B008J34466|3.0|Really enjoy a few of these songs. Never considered myself a Pink fan, but do like most of the songs. There is profanity, which I don't care for. May have just purchased a few of the songs I liked (without bad language), instead of the whole album if I have known this.
B00A27X972|4.0|A friend recommended this book and although I was a bit hesitant after reading the synopsis, I'm glad I read it. It starts out very light and you will laugh out loud at some of the observations of the &#34;humans&#34;.  It defintely gets more serious as the book progresses, but it holds your interest and really does get you invested in the plight of the characters.  I can honestly say it was enjoyable and I wouldn't hesitate recommending this to someone looking for a good read.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Very interesting book. One of the best authors with brilliant style, magnificent language. Perfect book, you will read it with real pleasure.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Wow, what a gripping tale. Tragic. Quite different than the Harry potter books ( although those had a lot of sadness too.)
B0012E2HRC|5.0|Arguably one of Clint Eastwood's best movies. Funny, sad and one you wont forget in a hurry. All Eastwood's movies are different and this one is a true one off for him and Meryl Streep. If you like either of the stars then this is a movie for you. Just remember the tissue box.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|wow. who would of thought turning this folk tale bed time story in to a movie would actually work. This movie is 5 stars all around

B00F52YOPA|5.0|I liked this game so much, I wanted to compose a video review and jump up and down on my bed! I've never played a game so fun on my Kindle, I'm obsessed, I was randomly browsing games I have another hidden objects game and wanted to get a new one.

B00DGGIXS6|1.0|Anyone who knows me that I love Cher and am a huge fan.  I loved her last album, \\"Living Proof\\", and had been waiting for 12 years for her to release a new album.  So you can imagine my disappointment of having waited 12 years for garbage like this.<br /><br />This album is flat-out TERRIBLE!  The music is so generic sounding and dated and the Auto-Tuned vocals on every song are horrific.  She doesn't even sound human on most of the songs.  The vocoder vocals may have been cool on \\"Believe\\" and \\"Living Proof\\", but in 2013, they are really getting tired thanks to the fact that almost every artist on the radio today goes overboard with the Auto-Tune.  Cher has a good, unique voice and she doesn't need this garbage.  But back to the music - the songs are plain and you can hardly tell when one song starts and when one song ends because they all just run together since they all sound the same.<br /><br />The lyrics are ridiculous as well - on \\"Woman's World\\", she sings about \\"dancing on the club floor\\".  I'm not ageist, but lets get real: it's silly for a 67 year old to be singing about going to the clubs.<br /><br />I can't imagine this album becoming a success - the first single \\"Woman's World\\" was such a flop that it only charted at #125, so that says a lot, especially considering it's the only decent song on the whole album.  Cher really should have ditched the generic dance music and Auto-Tuned vocals and went back to rock.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a nice game to play, and it will make you thing a little if you want to get all the stars.<br />Nice game for your mind
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. Love the challenges and rewards. I do wish energy wasn't an issue as I could play this game all day.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not much to this game but you can still have some fun with it.<br />You can only play it for a short time or it will get boring. A lot like the real thing.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|but WOW, sounds like they didn't skip a beat, and then some! I should write a long comprehensive review of every song, but frankly don't waste any time at all, and just order this! Get the vinyl cuz it's a beautiful purple and sounds perfect! Great pressing.. I'm just overwhelmed with Hope's voice and every song has a unique flair to it. Might be their best record when it's all said and done, and that's saying a lot! Ok, that didn't take too long, I hope you ordered yours by now :D

It requires effort from the reader to test his abilities and persistance.<br /><br />I found it and good read and learnt a lot that so far only assumed.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|The subtle difference between indentured servants and slaves becomes clear in this book...  I enjoyed the book immensely; it has everything a historical novel should: romance, jealousy, drama, & blood.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Despite its predecessor which was not bad but not great either, I found this one an excellent read. Plot twists madly, and the reader will find himself engaged and astonished on how things develop.<br /><br />Martin is cynical and manages perfectly to mix Middle Age with Fantasy.

So when you can just cleanly scroll through the weather hourly then smoothly flick over to the meteorologists and their words, you just feel ridiculously sophisticated. Get this app if you enjoy feeling like king of your domain.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is so much fun omg I love wasting time on games like this I've never had so much fun on my phone yay
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep is pure King magic from beginning to end.<br />The book ties in some great character's from past King favorites and,as usual,develops a new cast that evoke the incredibly strong emotions King is famous for. A great read
B00DGGIXS6|1.0|I've been a fan since birth. But I Have to say this album just doesn't sound good to me. It has maybe 2 good songs on the whole thing. I purchased the target edition to get all the tracks, and have to say the miley remake \\"I Hope You Find It\\" and the target bonus track \\"Will You Wait For Me\\" are the only good songs on here, the rest sound like she had old demos laying around and had someone redo the music to them like she said they did to her mothers album.[[ASIN:B00CIAIH1O Honky Tonk Woman]] I was really expecting more,but i guess i shouldn't have since Woman's World just didnt do it for me. What a waste of $20, should have put the money towards a Cher greatest hits or something to get decent music.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very entertaining and thought provoking. I like the story within a story concept. Clothes and accessories are awesome nothing I see on a daily basis
0893860468|1.0|If you are interested in a book with concrete examples, how to develop yourself, forget this writings. A lot of words, but nothing for your daily life. This man ist after my opinion not a really teacher, he's a story teller.
B0058SNI58|4.0|Loved the immediate comfort (no break-in blisters) and cute style.  Would have given a five but the first pair I got had a defective back strap (stretched out 1 inch longer) and had to be returned.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|The only thing that I would change is that I wish that I could go back (or if there is a back button, I have't seen it).
B005PK553C|5.0|Once I saw the first episode I was hooked!  Jessica Lange was wonderful in her role as 'the neighbor'.  A must see!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is really fun I enjoyed much. I would recommend it  anybody . It  is good for all ages. Download it.
0399255370|4.0|It was a cute book.just a little too advanced for the 3 year old. We will save it for later.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love Mahjong. It is always fun. Anyone who likes puzzles. Will like this. I have been playing this game for a long time.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Brilliant!  Entertaining for both children and parents.  Episodes are built around classic stories that all kids should know.  Later Mater!
B009ZQNN90|5.0|one of my favorites. bought it also 7 years ago as a gift and loved ot just as much then.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Couldn't put this one down.  The ending was kind or abrupt , but still an excellent read.  I've never read this author before, so pleasantly surprised.
B002GJU54E|1.0|I never bought this book
0425263924|5.0|I loved it, I love the characters and following this love story.it was well worth the read.  I hope you continue these characters for many more chapters.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft pocket edition is a great game but you have no food bar and you cannot sneak or run and you also cannot get texture packs or skins.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Got this for my son and he loves it. He likes the music and sometimes just turns it on in his room to hear it
0756655307|5.0|I got this for my son - because he is a comic character fanatic. He LOVES it. And with all the new comic book based TV shows coming out - he uses it as a companion guide while watching them. When a new villain is introduced - he looks it up in his books and gets the history and the details and sees how the TV show may have changed/evolved the character. Lots of fun - awesome pictures.
B0017UOU9Y|5.0|This could easily be the best funk album ever, released in 1971 now on 180gram in all it's funkiness glory the sound is amazing to say the least, got to buy this for your vinyl collection today and Big Ups to Amazon for the best in packing this vinyl Gem, and the Fastest Shipping ever! THANKS AMAZON!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this little ap/game. It is fun to figure out how to escape from a room and find clues - It kind of reminds me of the game MYST I used to play - but a lot more simple. I would LOVE if they expanded this and would def. pay more for a more complex story line.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Firstly, let me say that Iron Man 1, 2, and The Avengers are my three favorite movies. I've watched them all many times and will do so again: I liked them all that much.<br />That being said; this movie was quite a let down.<br />The high tech that we all loved about the suit in the previous movies has gotten out of hand. They actually have the different parts of the suit having their own rockets and targeting system that can find Tony anywhere. Little parts, like the face plate alone, has rockets and tracking that can fly across the continent and find Tony anywhere. Even to me this was purely unbelievable.<br />Tony is suffering from PTSD. The whole movie we see several iron man suits but Tony isn't in them. They've become drones that are controlled by Jarvis. All the action we see from Tony is out of the suit.<br />I suppose the effort was to make us see and like Tony as just one of us normals. There is a tiny bit of success there when he interacts with the kid, but it falls short.<br />We don't go see Iron Man movies for warm and cozy normalcy. It's high tech adventure we  have come to expect and want from this series and we just don't believably get it in this movie.<br />I'm not sorry I watched it but I am glad I only rented it and didn't buy. I don't want to watch this one a second time.
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|works well and is very fun in pranking people (: love pulling it up and friends houses and pretending um doing the hacking.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. What a great series. Held your attention . Throughout. Can hardly wait for the movies. I hope  's Collins can write something new just as good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it is fun and easy entertainment.  good relaxation at the end of the day.  app works well no gliches so far.  i would like to be able to select the game #  but oh well.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The game starts our fun but the more you play, the longer and more expensive everything gets.  Unless you're willing to fork out a lot of money, it's a waste of time.  For example, a t-rex will cost you $40... Totally insane.<br /><br />Graphics are cool hence the 2 start instead of 1.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Would be even better if game would stop freezing after every update. Also stop not giving credits when due. The other problem I have is just when I get Bingo and hit the bar game ends.
B000JU7NCE|5.0|Correct, it is heavily weighted in favor of the albums in which Porl Thompson was involved.  That only makes sense as these were his first shows with the band since 1992.  I'm betting he was interested mainly in those songs/albums and I can't fault him or the band for that.  The albums and songs (and gigs too) with Porl's contributions are definitely the best the band ever did (although I do LOVE the first album).  The stripped-back version of the band seen on this disc is truly lean and mean, forcing (in a good way) everyone to focus and contribute at all times and the result is stunning.  This is a small window giving a glimpse of what might have been had Porl not been shown the door prior to the recording of the first album.  It is also possible that I am completely wrong but I choose to believe the former.  The towering screaming guitar in place of the keys on songs like 'In-Between Days', 'Just Like Heaven' and even 'Plainsong' gives these songs new life, significance and above all POWER.  If you like your music stripped-back, dripping with hooks and melody while also distorted and powerful then this is for you (even if you are not a long-time Cure fan...this is a different Cure, it may alienate some but will bring far greater numbers into the fold...even if only temporarily...nothing lasts any more).  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Three months later...<br /><br />I had my favorite parts on this DVD but after watching it repeatedly I have to say that the whole thing is awesome.  For whatever reason, the early songs are particularly enjoyable.  This band may not have had the subtlety of the Smith/Gallup/O'Donnell/Bamonte/Cooper line-up or the psyche-deliciousness of the '92 band but they do have something over all the other line-ups.  This is a screaming spitting squalling swearing m*****f***ing ROCK BAND and I love it.  The first song they played together, 'Open' at Live8, was a nice indication of just how heavy they could be.  The visual effects were probably (somewhat) necessary to keep the whole thing cohesive.  When you've got video and film from a few different sources over the course of nine gigs I suppose it's necessary to put a little frosting on top in order to make it hang together.  Liner notes say that the disc is to be played loudly and with no additional lighting (other than the television) in order to experience it properly.  The liners did forget to mention that someone somewhere along the line took LSD during the production sessions for this DVD.  That's it, it's an 'LSDVD'.  I like that.ects were probably (somewhat) necessary to keep the whole thing cohesive.

B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Loved it!<br /><br />This is not a high reading level read, but nevertheless very engaging and thought provoking. Read the entire thing in one sitting and loved every minute of it.
B005HJU7HA|3.0|It took me 6 months to finish this thing!  I like reading them and trying to figure out the ending before it gets told.  The very end, are short stories by the author, not Sherlock, and they make no sense at all.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Great game and its fun but sometimes it won't work to connect to online games for<br />the kindle fire. :( But it works great for apple products. :)
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|The movie truly surprised. It has an all-star cast and stays three steps a head of the audience. The story line is well thoughtful, suspenseful, and well planned. Though the movie is PG-13, my nine year old son and aging parents loved it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game, great graphics!  This game is tons of fun to play, has a bonus pinball side game you can play for upgrades, using bonus coins from killing zombies. I adore this game, and recommend it for Kindle gamers who enjoy Japanese genre and slaughter of zombies. Beware no blood or Gore though
B0014JKJHK|4.0|I bought these clogs to relieve my aching feet. I'm a chef and I work long hours on my feet. When I tried these clogs on I felt like I was walking on air. I wore them in the kitchen the next day to see if they would be more comfortable for my type of work. Initially they were fine, but after a few days my feet began to hurt again. I don't blame this on the clogs, I blame it on a concrete floor. I actually bought a second pair of the same clogs to wear casually. They are perfect for that!
B003FM1MNO|5.0|I am a fairly devoted Tolkien fan having read and studied the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings for a few years now and I liked the film very much. It captures the high points of the story as well as some of the subtle themes in the original text.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|The graphics are clean and smooth running. Easy to learn controls. Been playing for a day; fun so far. Ps this is not the traditional tower defense that I was looking for
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|The game is really fun, but won't let you access your army tab to recover troops returning from battle.  Please fix this soon.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant to start this book. A rabid fan since Slave to Sensation, book #1 in the Psy-Changeling series, the last couple of books had left me slightly disappointed. Heart of Obsidian had been touted as the book to answer all questions and the best addition to date. I had enormous expectations, so of course I wanted to preserve my hope for greatness. Expectations met and exceeded!!! Wow, just freaking wow! Loved it! Want to marry it!<br /><br />Kaleb was such a paradox of good and utter evil that I was hard pressed to declare him as prime hero material. Nalini Singh, as a master storyteller, slowly extinguished all my doubts and made me a Kaleb groupie for life. The blending of cause and effect was truly brilliant and in my opinion a feat of magic worthy of Penn and Teller. In order to salvage Kaleb for the readers, he must have the perfect heroine to pull him out of the cold darkness he has inhabited for so very long. Sahara absolutely fit the bill, damaged but not broken, strong yet compassionate, and above all a piece of Kaleb's heart that will keep him sane.<br /><br />To incorporate this monumental love story into the complete upheaval of the Psy world and not slight either aspect should be a near impossible task, but Nalini handled it with panache. This book completely resurrected my dwindling love of this series and I applaud Nalini Singh's wonderful talent and her ability to capture the hearts and minds of millions.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Must have movie for the Star Trek fan. Great visual effects, great storyline typical of Star Trek. Highly recommended for what is sure to be a new classic.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I just read this in a marathon. What a great read, very inspiring with awesome details. I laughed out loud a bunch of times, thanks altucher.
B00F35BV64|5.0|If you don't compare this more to the old series, the movie is really great and full of action. Give it a chance.
031623480X|5.0|There is truly no more appropriate scientific professional to write a book about the most damaging effects of gluten than a neurologist.  According to the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, \\"Our finding...implies that immune response  triggered by sensitivity to gluten may find expression in organs other than the gut; and the central and peripheral nervous systems are particularly susceptible.\\" Another article in the journal Neurology (Vol 56/No.3 Feb 13, 2005) emphatically states that \\"Gluten sensitivity can be primarily and at times exclusively a neurological disease, affecting not only the brain and nervous system directly, but also cognitive and psychiatric illness.\\"  Few medical professionals actually appreciate this, and instead operate with the illusion that gluten-immunoreactivity is solely a rare enteropathic condition (i.e.,affecting only the gut).  Most fail to recognize that 8 out of every 10 Celiac patients (Celiac being only 12% of what comprises the whole of autoimmune gluten sensitivity) have no gastrointestinal symptoms whatsoever!  --Or that the incidence of celiac disease, alone has increased more than 400% in just the last 50 years, alone. As a professional that spends my own days in private practice working with the brain (and also doing immunologic testing and nutritional consultation) I can only concur with these aforementioned peer reviewed conclusions--as well as those of Dr. Perlmutter--whole-heartedly.<br /><br />Fewer medical experts, still, have a fully conscious appreciation of the devastating impact of sugar and starch upon the functioning and premature aging of the brain, or the price we have paid (and continue to pay) as a society for our chronic dependence on these non-essential, nutrient-poor and damaging foods.  We owe a debt to David Perlmutter for offering his widely respected professional and insightful voice to these frequently overlooked (and enormously foundational) issues.  He shows uncompromisingly that his commitment is to genuine health and not simply disease--and/or merely the treatment of the symptoms of disease with pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />Among neurologists there is no one more insightful anywhere to write this important book than David Perlmutter. Dr. Perlmutter seems uniquely capable among his peers of truly \\"connecting the dots\\" and transcending the limits of the  compartmentalized thinking that typically comes with medical specialization.  To date, this is easily the most important book written on the often insidious and far-reaching effects of the world's most common (and most under-diagnosed) food sensitivity and least essential dietary inclusions.<br /><br />~Nora Gedgaudas, CNS, CNT<br />Author of \\"[[ASIN:1594774137 Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life]]\\"commitment is to genuine health and not simply disease--and/or merely the treatment of the symptoms of disease with pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />Among neurologists there is no one more insightful anywhere to write this important book than David Perlmutter.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I know that I've seen all of season one, so I had to catch up with season two.  Some I've seen, some I had not.  &#34;Oh, that's what happened.&#34;  The story is fantastic, if you watch the show at all, and you like it, you would love to collect the seasons, and all the episodes.<br /><br />At the end of a disc, there is a selection of what you may want to watch, or listen to, for example, deleted scenes, or commentaries made by the producer, director and writer.  I enjoyed that while watching the episode over again.  And I thought it was funny that they have to keep reminding each other that they have to keep talking about the episode and not just get lost in watching it again.  Quite charming actually.<br /><br />Yes, my intentions are to collect more complete seasons.  It's good stuff.  K
B005544TRQ|5.0|Enjoyed it because its a fast paced show.  Tried to submit what I just wrote but........<br />I do not get this... they require that you write so many words on one of these.  Guess this will be my last review as that requirement is  insane.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is so much fun! Makes you think, observe, move quickly.  Good relaxation but fun to keep your mind open
0744014956|1.0|There are several problems with this guide.<br /><br />1. In the vehicles section, there is a typesetting error that switches Brakes and Acceleration stats on some pages so you have no idea which is supposed to be correct.<br />2. Total lack of any information on how to make money (the biggest thing I got this strategy guide for).  No section for stock market, no stock tips, no money making tips.  This game is about money, and a good strategy guide would show you how to make money.<br />3. Very low detail of strategy.  Most missions only have a few short sentences on what to do.  Only covers the most basic details of each mission.<br />4. Does not attempt to provide any play tips.  Some details like \\"Where is a good place to park the getaway car\\" are sorely needed and not provided.<br />5. General typos and spelling mistakes show this was a rushed job and not worth your money<br /><br />EDIT:  I have found even more misprints.  This guide is full of them.  It's incredibly frustrating to have to Google for the CORRECT information when I purchased an \\"OFFICIAL\\" guide.  BradyGames is skimping on quality control massively here.<br /><br />6. Collectibles are all over the place. Following in order will lose you hours of time.  Bradygames asks YOU to do the work THEY are supposed to do, and determine a good order in which to collect all items, do all stunt jumps, etc.  They put no time into calculating the fastest way to do everything.  They just listed everything in the order they found them in.  #5 will be in Paleto bay (farthest north), #6 will be in the airport (farthest south), then #7 will be in Paleto again, and so on.<br />7. Blips on maps (like stunt jump start and landing points) are often misplaced, yet they show you the screenshot of the correct place with the wrong map overlaid where the correct map would be (the in-game map), forcing you to google for the same screenshot, only without Bradygames' incorrect map blocking the view of the correct map.<br />8.  Missing missions.  It does not cover The Last One, or Mrs. Phillips.  SPOILER: These are the two missions that happen after the main storyline.  Still missions though, but missing from this guide.<br />9.  Missing easter eggs.  I thought there would be at least some mention of aliens, bigfoot, or ghosts. No mention at all.  No guide on how to get these easter eggs.<br />10.  No health / food item location guide.  This is very important as another reviewer mentioned.<br />11. Things seem to be crammed into the book.  The margins are razor thin.  It's like they were trying to save space.  Like they had a limited number of pages.  This would also explain why they also only covered the basics and there is so much missing.<br />12.  The text is very small.  The maps are very zoomed out and you will need a magnifying glass to read many of them.  Some maps are unreadable even with a magnifying glass.  Very poor print quality control.<br /><br />More to come. Don't buy this.  Use IGN and Google.  You will save yourself frustration and time.<br /><br />EDIT 2:  I am just stating facts... What is the deal with people saying this is not a helpful review?  This guide is full of major errors and I have pointed them out.  Why is that not helpful?  Bradygames employees probably don't find it helpful... but my fellow GTA fans definitely should take my warning.  This is a very low quality guide, and IGN and Google are your best bet right now.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Different plot twists, interesting characters, fast moving pace, have to pay attention to everything.  Would watch again to catch more of the nuances.  Few things little far-fetched.  Except for one of the opening scenes with one of the leads and a lady who is rapidly stripping down, everything is also kid appropriate.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This is awful my little sister downloaded this app she is 4 she crashes all the time. Make it easier.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|The acting is top notch in this terrorism thriller.  The show is very well-done and the plot moves quickly, with many twists and turns.  Once you start watching it, you will want to watch it straight through (which is, of course, the beauty of waiting for the DVD!).
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I had no idea this was even out there.  Couldn't wait to see the whole season.  I am going through with drawl now!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh boy...great read. I could not stop crying toward the end. I definitely recommend reading this. Such a great story line!
B00AO686MY|5.0|Roger Rabbit is one of my favorite classic films and it is still my favorite now. Who Framed Roger Rabbit had many cartoon characters like Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Daffy Duck, Droopy Dog, and Bugs Bunny. My favorite scenes are when the Toon weasels who cannot stop laughing to they die and the piano duel between Daffy and Donald. It is 1947 where Toons and humans coexist together, a Toon hating and drunk private eye (Hoskins) whose brother was killed by a Toon, had no sense of humor and was hired by a greedy and short tempered producer (Tilvern) to follow Roger Rabbit's (Fleischer) wife, Jessica Rabbit (Turner) who is \\"cheating\\" on Roger. He does not know that he will battle a corrupt judge with a dark secret (Lloyd) and his idiotic and murderous Toon weasel henchmen to free Roger of murder charges of a factory owner (Kaye). Who Framed Roger Rabbit is so funny and I promise you will not regret this recommend if you buy this funny film.
B009LDD54K|5.0|This was the best of the three seasons for Boardwalk Empire.  One of the new characters won an Emmy for Best Actor in a Series.  You must watch to appreciate all the new and old actors who make this a series you don't want to miss.
B008JFUO72|5.0|This movie was fabulous, plain and simple. And one of the interesting things about it is that it just shows you how much it means to be a \\"movie star.\\"<br /><br />I had just watched the Emmys a couple of days ago, and then watched this. There may be few people with less charisma than Neil Patrick Harris, but in this politically correct age, even without charisma, they let him host the Emmys. That said, watching Iron Man 3 shows you just what a movie star is, namely Robert Downey Jr.  Since I had just watched the Emmys, it really started the neurons burning about how great it is to watch a movie star do what movie stars do. Maybe next years the Emmys will get a movie star to host them so they can be interesting.<br /><br />Back to the movie, a couple of reviews say, \\"misdirection,\\" well yah sure, but it isn't cheating misdirection where they come out of left field and you feel cheated. It is \\"complicating the plot,\\" as one needs to do to have a complete story. One might also note that Don Cheadle was great and there wasn't any of that \\"oh we were slaves\\" that seems to be so popular today. Seriously, it would be nice if that could be packed away. Don Cheadle didn't seem to speak \\"black English,\\" was crisp and good-looking, macho, and overall great. Compare that to the whining Oprah in The Butler? Who doesn't want to be around Don Cheadle so shall we talk racism or shall we talk what kind of person we want to be around...<br /><br />What I really liked about it, if memory is correct, is that even though this is a Shane Black movie, I didn't hear the \\"f-word\\" even one time. If that isn't a cause for celebration what is? And Gwenyth Paltrow? Well let's celebrate having a woman as the female lead who doesn't have altered breasts. She coulda had another five pounds but hey, who can complain when she was competent, and actually wore the suit at one point.<br /><br />Good job to all and well worth owning so buy it and feel comfortable watching with your children.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|I never was a zombie movie fan, but I have to say that this exceeded my expectations.  Brad Pitt as an understated, rather uncomplicated \\"super hero\\" makes a superb performance, and the plot is unencumbered by any of Hollywood's typical romantic hogwash.  Excellent special effects.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|Four years ago T Bone Burnett-known primarily for his successful productions with Elvis Costello,Marshall Crenshaw,Roy Orbison,John Mellencamp added his charms to the production for Sir Elton's collaboration with Leon Russell [[ASIN:B003TWP5JC The Union]]. So it was decided he would produced Elton on his own. This year marks Elton John and Bernie Taupin's 45th anniversary as one of the most vital pop songwriter/lyricist combos in history. There's been many bumps along the way,Taupin being absent from the collaboration and Elton facing many personal demons. Now he's 66 years old-he and his husband with an adopted child settled into a comfortable domestic life. He is now the sort of musical icon who can say that the people he influenced musically are themselves icons who've influenced people. One thing about Elton that I've noticed however is new music from him never totally tapers off. He seems to retire for awhile. But the man has an apparently endless supply of music left in his soul,and Taupin an equal amount of lyrics to go with them. So here's Elton John,back with a new set of fifteen songs. And there's a lot of treasures to be heard.<br /><br />  \\"Oceans Away\\",\\"My Quicksand\\",\\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" and \\"Voyeur\\" are all powerfully melodic piano rock ballads-superbly constructed with that Elton/Taupin synergy that made them famous and respected all these years. These songs are a bit more nostalgic however-rather like poetry from a photographic diary than present tense experience. \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\" is a more moody and lightly country influenced song reflecting on one of the more infamous cases of homophobic bullying in history of the renowned poet/writer. The level of sympathy and pure storytelling from Taupin is of course outstanding. \\"A Town Called Jubilee\\",\\"Home Again\\" and \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" are beautifully soulful shuffles with a bouncing rhythm somewhere between the mid and uptempo's-full of gospel-style fervor and joy. \\"The New Fever Waltz\\" introduces the time honored love-as-warfare concept in a song that could definitely be taken two ways,but whose imagistic lyrics run the full gamut of the emotions themselves. \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight)\\" is a spunky nostalgic trip that musically finds Elton rediscovering the blues-and is one of my personal favorites here. The title song closes the album on a slowly swinging and jazzy note.<br /><br />  One thing people may notice especially strong on this album is the richer,more growling sound of Elton's singing. Its not a rasp. And often as renowned singers voices begin to age? They often,in all honestly,lose their appeal-especially on the technical end. Elton's voice still retains it's full power however. And because he's always had deep singing tone,the more seasoned tones he gets on his album makes what was already a powerful voice somehow even stronger-at least to me anyway. T-Bone Burnett's production didn't make this a dreary or overly dark album at all. John's melodies and Taupin's lyrics retain their imaginative qualities in full throughout these fifteen songs-all of which are extremely strong from start to finish in this reviewers opinion. One thing that does happen is that the five musicians playing on this album with him-including Raphael Saadiq on bass,are produced very slickly and clean. But the arrangements are very subtle without undue orchestration. So its a bare bones Burnett-type production that comes to life by virtue of Elton's spirited melodicism as well as that of the musicians. It is definitely a successful musical match. And should Elton wish to continue on musically after this? It wouldn't be a bad system to maintain. In all honesty one of Elton's best studio albums in years,perhaps even one of his strongest ever.oduces the time honored love-as-warfare concept in a song that could definitely be taken two ways,but whose imagistic lyrics run the full gamut of the emotions themselves. \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight)\\" is a spunky nostalgic trip that musically finds Elton rediscovering the blues-and is one of my personal favorites here.

B006S01GH2|4.0|A beautiful film full of fantasy, that helps us bear  our collective reality. Pay special attention to Amelie's last conversation with her father.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is a must see. It will leave you laughing for days. Pitch Perfect is hilarious.  My husband and I both watched this move and enjoyed it, great comic relief.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was younger and loving it. Now my kids watch it and they love it (and I still love it!). The thing I like about it is that it's a kids movie, but not so squeaky-clean that it's lame. There's a little profanity, but not so much that its tacky, which I think makes it more real. The props, the cast, the plot, are all top-quality. This movie is entertaining for all ages.
B0060D123K|5.0|This movie was one of my kids favorite holiday movies. My granddaughters now love it. They watch it every weekend!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Just Downloaded The Latest And Not Only Would It Not plAy Video Or Audio, My Youtube App No Longer Plays Video Or Audio!!! I Dont Know What These Bastards Did But Avoid This Update!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|(Note: I'm not Michelle Hardbarger, I'm her daughter, so, just wanted to clarify that).<br /><br />Honestly, what's the big deal?<br />I didn't find this book nearly as amazing as people insist.<br />Even the the things that did interest me weren't enough to make it anywhere near top notch.<br />Katniss is bland, unemotional, and difficult, and more than once I found myself ready to smack her.<br />Peta is altogether exasperating and almost aggrevates me as much as Katniss, and none of the other characters did much to impress either.<br />I think the whole star crossed lovers thing is what annoyed me most, but then again, that's just me.<br />Overall, the book just didn't deliver. It's hard to explain but it was just plain unimpressive and a major disappointment.<br />I will not be reading the rest of the series.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great entertainment! Love the story and the cast, recommend it to anybody who likes a good drama. Hope it's on for many more seasons!
B0013F1D02|4.0|Basic story: good vs. evil, but, with a fun, comedic focus... The special effects were excellent for the times and their resources.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|That is only worth 4 stars to me because it started out so slowly. But what the heck can you do about that?
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|This is the only photo editing program I use for my pictures. It's the only one I have found so far that I like. I love it!!!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I enjoyed this fascinating novel about race, immigration, hair, and the added bonus of a beautiful love story.  It was a page-turner for me.

B0036S4B6M|3.0|The Netflix show is much more exciting and characters very fleshed out, but this book tells the true story. People should read the book before watching the show.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup was a breeze with my ipad. Wireless reception is good with a wireless n router several rooms away.<br />Streaming Netflix and Youtube in 1080p without a lag and good picture. I have a 30mb cable connection and<br />with this device streaming hd I still have 20mb overhead for other tasks on the network.<br />You can of course stream almost anything with google chrome from your android phone or pc/laptop.<br />Unfortunately there is no support for IOS using chrome to cast to the device.<br />It will play my library files using chrome(minus sound for some .mkv files) at standard definition. It stutters and<br />freezes if you try to stream hd files in 1080p or 720p. for that you can get a good media player like kdlinks<br />or roku etc. Overall, for a device this cheap it's a winner.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really don't know what I can about this except that I really like it and find it very useful.
B009GED3HS|5.0|It's a digital stream. Hard to critique. The price was right and my wife was happy to be able to catch up on one of her favorite shows.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love this version of Emma. There is much more detail and the actors playing Emma and Mr. Knightly are wonderful!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great Book<br />I like Vince Flynn's cast and his story telling. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Good history, fair price and good for cinephiles collections!!!...It tells the true story of a lie the world swallowed for years...

B0011EU0NG|5.0|Loved this movie ever since I was a kid. What could be better a bucket of popcorn and to sit down and watch an old movie
B00371XIJE|5.0|I didn't cry when old yeller died. Hachi made me cry like an adolescent girl. Such an amazing and powerful story.  All dog owners must see this film.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Relaxing game .I rate it a 4 corals ,rocks ,colors are all pretty they need to give more pearls.so we can open the treasure boxes
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This gives a more realistic life context for disciples. Some of his conclusions certainly go against traditional believes. It would be interesting to hear an equally trained Catholic theologian respond to this book.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is an awesome app I haven't found any better it is accurate on the caliber of each gun my favorite gun is the bar
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was amazing! Just amazing! I can't wait to read the other two books. Thank you for writing these wonderful books.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I've long been interested in the historical Jesus, the \\"real\\" Jesus, and this book more than delivers. I found the book readable and credible--reflecting the author's deep knowledge of Christianity and Jesus' life.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|Kids killing kids is immoral, inhumane, depraved and sadistic. That is all you need to know. There are no redeeming qualities or useful message depicted in this movie.
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|What a great story! There really isn't another sports story out there to compare it to. A stellar job by the cast and an overall great movie. Now one of my hands-down favorite movies of all time.
B00846REIS|3.0|Too much like 50 shades of grey. If I had read this first maybe it would've been better. Just predictable
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is a fantastic book, entertaining from the start to the end.<br /><br />A hell of a debut by Ryan, cant wait for more!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the drama and the period feel of the show.  Great acting, interesting plot lines and wonderful scenery.  Love this series!
B00008NG5V|5.0|If you like Jack Jhonson ur going to love it and his other albums. Excelent work I would also recomend you to his live concert, that album shows he is a great artist
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun game quite addictlng.  I liked that it challenged me without being impossible to solve. Level 10 is definitely the trickiest.
B00594XOZU|2.0|At the begging it worked fine but now its all this is taking more than it should try again later dtuff like that it won't let me sign in im getting very mad now
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A little hard to navigate in the beginning...keeping track of characters and their stories....<br />Liked how it made me wonder where it all was leading...
B009FZHYKU|2.0|It's a pain to get to the next episode but other than that it's great. it's a little expensive for one season and you don't even download them so you can watch them when you're not on the Internet.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|whomever does not like this movie should be sent to an African refugee camp and have to wake up each morning to a bucket of pig slop splashed on their face for the rest of their lives raising honey badgers
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its sooooo fun i could play it all day it is soooo fun and challenging :) :)just got it on my iphone
B00DHHFKE4|2.0|I chose to order this book because the Netflix series by the same name captured my attention completely.  I can only begin to describe the disappointment I've felt upon realizing how dry the \\"real\\" story is compared to the screen version.  Kudos to the screen writer who transformed a dull tale into a series that has everyone talking.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book kept you interested and was a quick read.  Enjoyed the balance between the past and present.  Learning the meaning of flowers was enlightening.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Since I'm required to say something... I guess I can say it's full of action and almost as good as the last Star Trek. I say almost because for an old Trekie, I remember James Kirk taking Captain Pike, unable to speak and condemed to a chair without any body movement, to a planet where he could live out his remainig days with his illusion of being whole and happy. The indigenous people allow this to ocurr. The current movie takes away from that memory so doesn't really set well. There seems to be a few other conflicts as well although minor ones.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My android phone came with YAHOO weather, I hate it. Weather.com is more accurate, the temp on m yahoo is NEVER accurate for my location and I like all the features with weather.com.  Attractive and can watch videos, forecast etc.  GREAT APP
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was enjoying this series so much that I found myself TRYING to read the last book in this series slowly. Didn't work, cause I couldn't put it down. I'm so happy that this is not a trilogy!! Love Gideon and Eva, they truly are two halves that make them whole. Can't wait for the fourth, Captivated by you. Thank you Ms Sylvia Day for such a great read and I truly hope that there is a fifth and sixth. Many thanks!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is super fun it has really good grAphics too. The only thing is it has lots of parts involved so it's hard to learn.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|The first Minecraft Lego set sold out in a heartbeat and went on eBay for $100 plus around the holidays, so I struck early on this one.
B008602KQI|2.0|Why did the 100 + &#34;producers&#34; green-light the many &#34;directors&#34; to hire and assign scores of stylists or wardrobe folks to the weird, uninvited, unwelcomed, distracting enterprise of jazzing things up in terms of weird hair do's?<br /><br />Sci Fi doesn't need:<br />Ahead of their time hair-do's,<br />Brit accents,<br />Alternative lifestyle tolerance sub plots,<br />Racism morality play underpinnings or overtones,<br />Does it?<br /><br />Not hating. It just feels like an interruption to the story, a literary crutch, an artificially grafted patch --<br />like they do when they hire stand-up comedians to &#34;punch up&#34; occasional bland runs within the script with lame comic relief.<br /><br />It just tastes artificial. IMHO.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife will survive a Nuclear Blast!!! It is heavy and strong and awesome!!!  I stripped the black paint off which revealed the gun metal gray color which I like much better.  I wrapped the handle with tennis racket grip tape to improve grip.  (the handle is fine but a little slick)  The sheath is ok but I modified it as well.  I took the nylon belt loop off and installed a large Tek Lok.  I put a convex grind on the edge and it will shave hair easily.  Can't wait to get out in to the woods and put this thing through the paces.<br /><br />Update...10/12<br />Took my BK out on the trail for the first time and was batoning some logs.  First log went great, second log not so much.  The blade broke about a quarter of the way down the handle.  I was speechless when it happened.  I still can't believe this thick hunk of steel actually broke!  The knife is still usable as of know but I'm not sure how long it will last.  I looked at the warranty and read that batoning is not covered under Ka bar's warranty.  I will update again after speaking with Ka bar on the phone.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|During the first 2 chapters, it was going a little slowly, so I didn't think I would finish the book.  Then all #%&* broke loose in the story, and I was hooked!<br />Ms. Clare begins the writing as tho she is writing for 3rd graders.. not very many descriptive phrases, and just not what I expected from a popular book.  Later on I noticed that she stepped up her style, and it was much more interesting to read.  And the story line kept me riveted!<br />I am now in the 2nd book of the series, &#34;City of Ashes&#34;, and will complete the series, I'm sure!
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|Still the best movie of its kind even after 40+ years.remember what these guys did on the equipment they had next time your whining about your bike with fuel injection,14 inches of travel,half as much weight and twice the horsepower these guys had.also watch endless summer if you enjoy this! Ride on Harvey Mushman!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Enjoyed the book very informative,I had no idea he invented the things that he did.excellent story of his life but sad.
B00AEBEQW8|4.0|Funny, but the print is too small and get lost in the color background.  Bought the print copy for the younger kids.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I absolutely loved this album and still do....  It proves why she is still the one and only Queen Of POP.  It has some very catchy tunes plus the tons of messages she is famous for...  She put some of her anger into this album and it benefited her well.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The science is silly, but who cares?  It's just like a ghost story you'd tell around a campfire, but with the Required Hot Chick for a central character.  The Walter character is there for comic relief, but they try a bit too hard on that one.<br /><br />There were several writers, and each had a different take, making some of the episodes contain material that contradicts earlier material - again, it's a good ghost story, so who cares?  Incidentally, the third season is the final one that makes any chronological sense... the fourth season may have run out of synoptic material, and goes into alternate time lines, 3 copies of each character, etc.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I saw the show when she came to Atlanta and let me tell you no matter what, it was more fantastic in person than on video but I love the DVD all the same....  It takes me back to when I saw her just the weekend before Miami (and this was filmed) and love how not much was different (except a few of her speeches).  She is absolutely stunningly beautiful and incredibly talented.  Her shows are expensive but she gets out there does her thing (can't deny the lady still has it) and puts on the show of a lifetime, which definitely gives you your money's worth and she never fails to voice and show her love to her fans.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Because of all the BOGUS durability reviews fot this bag, that are more than likely left by employees of other RIDICULOUSLY PRICED bag manufacturers, I was hesitant to buy this bag initially. Now, after realizing how nice and reasonably priced this bag is, it really pisses me off that I almost got tricked into buying one of the rip off bags due to fake durability reviews left here. And just to be 100% sure, when I did finally buy, I decided to wait a year until I posted a review.<br /><br />So (almost) a year later, I can honestly say that this is, BY FAR, the best deal for a new camera bag that you will find.<br /><br />DURABILITY: Amazing! Don't believe the other reviews that say the handles and straps rip. I call BULL s***. I USE HEAVY PROFESSIONAL GEAR. The HEAVIEST pro gear you can fit in this bag. Full size pro bodies and full size pro lenses, and my bag is packed full! Nikon D3, 80-200mm AFS (the BEAST), 85mm 1.4D, SB-800, extra D3 batteries, etc, etc. All of my gear that I carry around in this bag is HEAVY. After almost a year, it's PERFECT. The zippers, the straps, the handles, the padding, everything.<br /><br />This is the best deal you will find for a professional style photography equipment bag, and YES, it's DURABLE.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS NEWER VERSION OF ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS! I HAVE TO BE HONEST, THOUGH, THAT IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS SINCE I HAD PLAYED ANY ANGRY BIRD GAMES BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN SUCH A LAG TIME WITH NO NEW UPDATES.  GLAD TO SEE NEW POWER-UPS AND AS ALWAYS THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT!
B009RH973I|5.0|I've had the orange version of this on my Kindle HD for about a year.  My wife recently decided to get her own kindle.  Since mine case worked so well, I'm in the processing of buying her the same case but different color.  Out of interest i read a couple reviews where one or two people stated a problem with over heating.  The first thing that came to mind is \\"What?!?!?\\" My kindle genetates almost no heat and this case has protected it very well.<br /><br />Even with a toddler in the house, this case holds its own.  We have loaded several apps on the kindle for him.  So when he manages to drop the HD it has suffered no ill effect.  Which is why I feel very comfortable buying one to protect my wife's HD
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is so well written, clever, funny and more importantly interesting. I have fallen in love with tv all over again.
B00AW57L96|4.0|Really interesting, lots of twists and turns, and challenging scenarios to process. Particularly liked the un-traditional ending  - highly recommended book club book.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I was surprised how much like real pinball this game plays. Tilt actions work like a real machine. All kinds of missions, multi balls, unlock puzzles, skill shots and targeting games.
6305132984|5.0|West side story has it all.<br />great story (modern romeo and juliet), gorgeous score by Leonard Bernstein, wonderful commentary on stereotyping and breaking the barriers that ignorance creates.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|The acting in this movie is great.  I like to be drawn into a movie, not feel like the actors are reading a script.  That's the emotion you get when watching this.  I won't speak to it's accuracy since I'm not an historian, but I was thoroughly entertained and riveted.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I've only played the game altogether about an hour... maybe. I'll tell u what, this game i can already tell there is alot of detail in it. Mulitple armors, weapons and i can't wait to...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app, easy searching, easy to navigate. I would certainly recommend it. I've used several Bibloe apps and this one is best by far.
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|I'm gonna be kinda brief. These guys are guaranteed to keep you on your feet dancing. Their thumping beats and swirling synths revive the best moments from 80s synth pop coated with the lushness of 70s disco. They deserve to be BIG!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire was an intense book with action from the very first page.  With the ground work already layed out from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the book had a quick start.  I couldn't put it down!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Great film.  Many people had problems with this film, be it for the way they presented the villain or the amount of time Iron Man was (spoiler) not in costume.  I for one enjoyed it as it lent more to the character development.  For those who know nothing of the comics, the way the villain was presented will not affect you.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I love it i am very happy with it. It is worth evry dollar i payid for it. The box is very cool
B00CTNUMPO|5.0|I had not yet purchased many Disney films, so I am grateful that I waited until now.  I truly enjoy the blu ray quality of this classic.  I recommend upgrading to blu ray even if you already have this on DVD or VHS.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this hopeful historical novel.  The Orphan Train is a fictional account of a period in our history we hear little about woven in with the story of a young girl growing up in the foster care system of today.  A story of heartbreak and sadness with the overriding theme of perseverance and resiliency.  I read straight through it in one day.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked this story - it was a fleshed out version of the novelette I read many years ago.  The author does a good job of writing characters that are easy to care for.  Quite a bit of thought went in to the creation of these books by a very talented author.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Okay wasn't happy so many characters are lost, but the ending left me shocked!!!! Is there a 4th book????? Ms Collins your writing another.... right haha
B0035JNTA6|2.0|I guess if you're looking for flick you can watch whilst brain dead, then this is the movie for you.  Very juvinile and childish.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't like the concept at first, but it was amazing I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to read the other two!!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|The story is fun and keeps you spellbound.<br />There is some crude language which detracted from an otherwise outstanding movie, which is fairly typical for movies recently.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't wait to read ,hooked completely.  Hope this has a good ending....gotta have the last installment...totally recommend this triolgy...on to the 3rd book
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Been waiting for this album ! Excellent overall. I wish there were less ballads , but I like the heavier / prog rock/ metal tunes . Stellar musicianship / songwriting !  Buy this !  If you likethis genre also Buy the MP3 Albums of these similar bands here on AmazonMP3 : Symphony X - Magnitude 9 - Kamelot - Fates Warning - Threshold
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Entertaining enough. As much as Michael Cane is a great actor you don't believe him as a unlike able rich guy. And the French actresses moles deserved their own lines. Plot was laughable but not the worst $4 I have ever spent.
B00008YNHD|2.0|Out of all the tapes I ordered, and my husband has played so far,this DVD does not work...like having a &#34;blank&#34; tape. It happenes to be one of my husbands favorite movies, and was a birthday gift. Don't know what to do with it or who to send it to???!!!!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Terrible don't waste the time. Any other actors and this would have been what they call a B movie.  aka terrible
0618918248|5.0|Great book.  Loved it.  I can only imagine how much better off our societies would be if we gave up subscribing to delusional reasoning born from superstitions and faith (absence of facts).  Thank you Mr. Dawkins, I choose reality!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a very good and useful app but lately it keeps upgrading with too many bells and whistles, ads which are distracting and annoying and slow it down.  I just wanted their excellent weather reporting and I get Weatherman U-tube with Ads.  Keep it simple Weather channel!
B00CL0J99K|4.0|First off this movie only garnered a 4 star rating with me due to the Blu-Ray Special Features. Iron Man 3 for me was lacking in what made Iron Man, Iron Man. I will say however I do get WHY they decided to go this route with the movie, however I think it was a little over done and lacking in certain areas.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-I LOVED the visuals in this movie. Some of the best I've ever seen.<br />-I liked the different twists this movie had to offer.<br />-I wasn't that big on comics, I watch a movie for entertainment value and AT the theaters I liked the Mandarin Twist.<br />-RDJ does his best Tony Stark yet, and the cast was a really good fit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-NO point for having war mach...I mean Iron Patriot in this movie except to use him as a plot device. WHY give him a big shoulder canon if he isn't going to use it.<br />-Not enough Tech. I know Stark is mentally broken after the events in NY so I DO understand his suite will have glitches as well as his home security (which by the way that scene was just phenomenal), but I mean ALL of his gadgets break?<br />-After re-watching the movie I saw that that the mandarin plot was dragged on for TOO long until the twist. They should have found a better way to deal with it. Mandarin was set up to be the biggest threat Tony ever faced yet they just used him as a gimmick for a guy that has a grudge against him?<br />-There is ONE deleted scene that should have made it to the final product and they dropped the ball on it. It was the scene with the kid and his bullies. THAT scene would have added so much more depth, character, and relationship to Tony and The Kid.<br /><br />Overall I bought it to complete the trilogy and I give it a solid 7.9-8.1 just because the Blu-Ray features made it a must own.
B00EQRP5LW|4.0|Good soulful r&b! Legend really brings back the legend from the 1st two albums. Not a lot feAtures and the production is good!
B008M721MS|3.0|For the most part, Skype works well on my Kindle Fire HD. Have tested it out in different locations and I've conceded at this point that my dropped calls at home are due to my questionable internet service provider. HOWEVER -- Skype ALWAYS crashes if I'm signed-in to Skype and (like most people) put the Kindle in sleep mode when not in use with it password enabled. When I receive a call and need to unlock my Kindle, Skype crashes and I receive an error message that simply reads \\"Skype has stopped.\\" I wouldn't even be writing this review if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME.Another small complaint is that it takes far too long to sign in. I'm waiting in excess of 30 seconds during the sign-in process. It takes a fraction of that time on the mobile version and the PC version. It is in my personal opinion that the Kindle version needs MUCH improvement.<br /><br />I'd be interested to know if any others are experiencing the crashing problem or if it's just me.
B007N8RULO|5.0|this is one of the best games there are. You just want to play it again and again. It's a great game for all ages. My grandson introduced it to me.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I loved it. I only tried it the first night but I'm hooked. My children always use music to fall asleep, but I think this is much more relaxing. Thank you
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|Big fan of Sting's.  Not so much this album.  It seems to be self serving in many regards and just 'blah'.  Save your money and buy only the songs that appeal to you.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Great movie depicting the relationship between a controversial, unconventional speech pathologist, Lionel and his rather unexpected  patient, King Albert George, VI.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This was a wonderful read. It crept up on me until I couldn't put it down.<br /> Quite fanciful but totally amusing with such likeable characters and a great sense of humanity.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Filled with amazing characters in a fantastical place is one of Miyazaki's best animated films. The heroine isn't on that you appreciate right away-she's bratty, and whiny. But being trapped in a world unlike anything she could ever imagine she learns to grow up fast and appreciate those around her.<br />This was the first Miyazaki film for me, and has gotten me hooked since.<br />If you enjoy fantasy with a little fun, and a great message, check this one out.
B007SGM084|5.0|These three books have had me captivated for two weeks unable to sleep eat or work normal. I am looking for my Christian Grey! What a beautiful romantic sexy  and on the edge trilogy! I can't wait till the movie comes out! Fifty Shades yes yes yes! OH MY!<br /><br />Thanks EL James Betsy three books I read in a long time!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John is so very talented in telling a story and pulling you in immediately. He is able to use few words to simply, yet very succiently convey a character. I compare him to Agatha Christie for that rare talent. A very fine tale, well told & believable. A lovely read from an inventive & imaginative author who never disappoints!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The movement on kindle(tilt),that you move the kindle the way you move and the direction that you are going in
B008M721MS|3.0|I have yet to do what we purchased the Kindle for, to contact our grandkids. I have gone to Skype Help (nothing) and Amazon Help twice and I still am fighting with this. The Skype and Amazon instructions, in my case were useless. Your folks tried to assist me, but I am still trying to figure out what to do. As you can figure out I am not a great computer person. When they say it is easy, not for all people.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game. Its fun and very easy. Not at all hard to play as long as you understand the basics of an rpg game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun! takes me back to my child hood and not too frustrating...just right for my old age!
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I like it, I'm honestly not sure if it's meant to teach you how to play or if it's just a fun game to play. However it keeps me entertained so I give four stars.
B00F2362IE|3.0|I got this game for my son on his Kindle Fire.  He absolutely LOVES it, when it works.  The only reason I gave it an &#34;okay&#34; review is because it usually takes 3-4 tries to get it to load.  He also has a problem with it randomly freezing or turning off in the middle of doing something, so he gets very frustrated.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|A convincing look at how chrisianity developed. The bible is fiction based on many many writers.  Each expands on rumor and conjecture and wishful thinking. A total fiction not based on anything said or done by the man Jesus of Nazareth.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've have never really afforded myself time for relaxing forms of self indulgence like reading. My husband had heard about these books and decided I might like to read them.  I started the first book on vacation and couldn't resist downloading the other two. I loved the story between Christian and Anastasia, and so many of the other characters brought to life in the books. The Story has also sparked more excitement into our relationship as husband and wife, so it has been effective on two wholly different levels.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|But then I was hooked. Really enjoyable read and a definite page turner. Looking forward to the Shift and Dust stories!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book. Hard to read in some areas, but completely and utterly beautiful in others. Shows the strength and bond of a true loving family.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is not normally my kind of book (on first glance it seems like chick-lit, but it isn't really), but my wife was reading it for her book club and the author is from my home town and went to the same university I did.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper is ultimately a mystery, and one with a very clever twist that is brilliantly disguised. Every time I thought I knew what the twist was, I soon discovered I was wrong. When it was finally revealed, it was stunning.<br /><br />I have two criticisms that make this four stars rather than five.<br /><br />The story is slow to get started. In the early chapters we get Laurel's internal dialog in excruciating detail. The author could easily have chopped fifty pages from the first third of the book without hurting the story or character development.<br /><br />The second criticism is related. In this early part of the story the adult Laurel is reflecting on events that occurred in her teenage years and yet she remembers everything (not just the murder) perfectly and with an adult perspective. Maybe it's just me, but at age fifty I don't remember anything from my teenage years in sufficient detail that I can have profound thoughts about what I was thinking, feeling and doing at the time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Simple to use. Not one that my daughter really goes back for often but she likes to play once in a while.
B00ENBS4GO|5.0|I have watched the entire Spartacus series and loved every minute of it!!  The first 2 seasons rank as my favorites, but McIntyre, who replaced the original Spartacus after his untimely death from cancer does a more than admirable job!  He had the most difficult job in replacing a character who we had all grown accustomed to and pulled it off. You can see him getting better in each episode until the final episode where he achieves glory in the ultimate finale!!!<br />  I will note a similarity between this and another of my favorite shows, The Walking Dead. In the WD, you would expect it to be about Zombies and gore, but it's not!!  The thing that makes the show are all the story lines taking place and the emotional attachment you make to the characters.  Same thing in Spartacus. You think of it as fighting and bloodshed. While there is more than enough of that to satisfy your bloodlust, it's the secondary stories and plots that are taking place that enthrall you and have you either loving or hating the characters. Sadly, this was the last season and I will forever remember Spartacus for all of it's glory!!
B002M9WW30|5.0|The rocky movies just never age for me, or maybe it is the nostalgia that I love. There is nothing more motivating than a Rocky day, watching these movies makes you feel like anything is achievable. Very happy with the bluray collection
B00495XR8E|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is one of my all-time favorite reads. This collection has them all. I have read them all several times and will read them again and again. It's great stuff so enjoy the adventure.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|This has got to be the best Cher CD ever! Her voice sounds amazing on every song from the high energy dance tracks to the wonderful power ballads. There is not a bad song on the whole CD. Every song could be a hit single and together they are a fantastic group of songs showcasing what a talented artist Cher really is. Standout songs are: Take It Like A Man, My Love, Dressed To Kill, Lovers Forever, I Walk Alone, Sirens, I Hope You Find It, I Don't Have to Sleep To Dream, and my personal favorite - Pride! Cher is back and she has never sounded better than on Closer To The Truth. The Deluxe version is a must for everyone due to the great bonus tracks. I bought the Deluxe version for several of my friends and they love it as much as I do!
B00003CXUM|5.0|I got this as a gift for someone who loves this director and he LOVED it. Great price and find.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and I love this game. It's different from the other run games, the mini games makes it the best.

B0063M22QO|5.0|It is a wonderful focus game. I can't stop playing. This is the game to challenge you and your kids to finish the puzzle before the time is up.
1452101248|4.0|My family & I are vegetarians, so we're always looking for new & imaginative vegetarian recipes. This book did not disappoint! I love the fact that these recipes are so different from what you usually find in books on how to cook veg, but some of the more unusual ingredients mean I usually have to plan ahead if I'm making a recipe from this book to make sure I get all of the needed ingredients. The dishes are rather impressive & quite delicious - they're wonderful for entertaining, or just when you want to make the regular nightly family dinner a bit more exciting. A must-have for any serious foodie who realizes that vegetables are more than just garnish for meat! The photos are beautiful & inspiring, and the overall look of this book is very attractive. Makes a great gift.
B005MLOOJA|2.0|The first season, the writing was so creative.  There were really well developed stories in each episode. Second season has gone from good stories to just gratuitous sex.  When you can't spend the time to write a good story just throw in sex that really has nothing to do with the plot.  Typical Hollywood crap, so disappointing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The first time I ever played this I could not put my kindle down! I played for over2 hours straight!! Very addictive and SO much fun!!!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Not what I expected, but it was great.  I don't really know what I was expecting come to think of it.  I actually cried.  Loved the music and all artists who collaborated.  Grohl has a fantastic way of telling a story and he didn't fail on this at all.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Got a little bogged down in a few places, but glad I finished the series.  Needed more closure with Dani.  Doll5647@sbcglobal

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE IN A TUNNEL.THE SLOT WHERE YOU CHARGE YOUR PHONE IS ONLY ACESSIBLE USING THE CHARGER THAT CAME WITH PHONE AND HAD HARD TIME USING JUST ANY EAR PLUGS TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC.I LIKE THAT IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND PROTECTS PHONE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR PERSON YOU ARE CALLING BEATS THE PURPOSE.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so fun. I can have a blast. playing why so fun for the person who made this love you so good
B000002QWD|5.0|I love the classic Christmas albums. Things just seemed better with them and it was about family and wholesome values. Shopping frenzies just don't come to mind when I listen to this. This music was around way before Walmart executives figured out how to make themselves rich while allowing their employees to struggle and besmirching the name and sacrifice of Jesus Christ! Beautiful, wholesome music.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|The best of the new generation of bluesmen in the perfect venue to appreciate his talent. Fantastic backing band also. Highly recommended along with his Royal Albert Hall recording.

1490313370|5.0|3 members of my family, including myself, are enjoying this book.  We've all read so many self help/examination books already.....but this is a refreshing read.  We won't be the same.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|I love this album - it has all the hits I grew up listening too and it was a good price. I really like these greatest hit compilations.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|Its about life. A great story to get caught up in and can relate to. One to watch over and over again.
B0054W4JQK|2.0|It might be due to my mood at the time, but I found the style of this book manipulative in the way I found Gone Girl manipulative, with unappealing characters who seem as if they were created solely to serve a high-concept plot. But both books were highly praised so I think I'm out on a limb here!<br />Just not for me.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie and we thought it was hilarious though somewhat sad. It is a must see for couples who enjoy comedies and can handle watching a lot of sexual scenes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning. I can't wait to start the next book! Much better than the movie, so much was changed or left out  in the movie which was a bit disappointing.
0486406482|4.0|I started this book one evening and simply HAD to put it away. There were more Mr & Mrs. characters, Miss characters, and others that simply boggled the mind. A week later, I picked up the book again & enjoyed it entirely. Once I settled down & got the first 2 chapters worth of characters straight in my head, I was able to keep up pretty well. I felt this was one of the more \\"crowded\\" books I had read. I had to remember that this book was not just about 1 female, but an entire village.<br />HINT: The Dover Thrift Editions can use very small print. If you want to read this & you don't own glasses, purchase a pair of magnifying ones!
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I thought the special effects and the story were entertaining. Sure there were some awkward acting moments.(I laughed and cringed a couple times...) It's a SciFi movie - not brain surgery or Shakespeare.  I found it light, fun and engaging enough to take my mind off things for a couple hours.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have one of these in each TV in the house.  If I'm using my Android tablet/phone or computer (Chrome Browser) and I want to send a webpage or on of the supported streaming sources to a TV, it's as simple as selecting the correct ChromeCast device from the ChromeCast list and switching the TV source to that HDMI port.  Easy as sending a print job.  For the price you can't go wrong
B000000WGL|5.0|This is one of the best albums I own. Fans of the Stones will love Keith stepping out and showing his roots and character. It is the best solo album by a member of the Rolling Stones hands down!

B00AEFY3MC|5.0|This review is based on having watched the film at home on both DVD and Blu-Ray. It is near the top of my list of all-time favourite films and IMHO is one of the funniest ever made (an opinion I share with Readers Digest, who have it on their list of the 100 funniest films).<br /><br />\\"Galaxy Quest\\" takes the mickey, very gently and sympathetically, out of science fiction TV and films in general and Star Trek in particular, of the actors who take part in them, and the fans who follow them.<br /><br />It tells the story of a group of actors who had been the stars of a former Science Fiction TV series, long since cancelled, who suddenly find themselves on a real and fully functional starship exactly like the NSEA Protector, the ship in their TV series, among aliens who think the actors really are the characters they played in the series.<br /><br />So the headline stars, Tim Allen, Alan Rickman, and Sigourney Weaver, are not really playing spoofs of Kirk, Spock, and a mix of Uhura and Deanna Troi, although the roles their characters played in the TV series within the film were clearly based on those Star Trek characters. Allen, Rickman, and Weaver are playing spoofs of Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and Nichelle Nichols/Marina Sirtis, and how actors who played their parts might react if they found themselves having to perform those roles for real.<br /><br />The fans are also a major part of the story and in fact the actors and their ship only survive because they are able to contact a fanatical group of dedicated Trekkies - sorry, \\"Questerians\\" (that's the word used in the film for the equivalent of Star Trek fanatics) - who know the details of the Enterprise - sorry, the NSEA Protector - so well that they can tell the actors how to fix a particular issue with the real ship.<br /><br />Many aspects of the series are lampooned on the show but in a sympathetic way - for example, Sam Rockwell puts on a hysterically funny performance as Guy Fleegwell, an actor who had a very minor role in the original show and keeps getting convinced that he is doing the equivalent of \\"beaming down in a red shirt\\" and therefore about to get killed. Guy's fears are the result of confusing reality with fiction, but sometimes they are fully justified, as when he prevents the other actors from doing something that would probably have got them killed for real with the words \\"Didn't you guys ever watch the show?\\"<br /><br />Similarly on realising that she's about to have to do for real something incredibly dangerous from one of the episodes, Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco (the Uhura/Troi figure) complains bitterly that the relevant episode was badly written, and later calls out in terrified rage, \\"The person who wrote this episode should die!\\"<br /><br />All the acting was excellent, and in addition to the three leads I would single out Enrico Colantoni who plays Mathesar, leader of a friendly alien race called the Thermians, and Justin Long as Brandon, a leader of a group of devoted Galaxy Quest fans with an encyclopedic knowledge of the show.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of this film is really spectacular, and I also liked some of the extras, particularly a \\"Galactopedia\\" reference facility which you can access while watching the film and which describes the universe of the \\"Galaxy Quest\\" series in great detail, just like the Star Trek reference books often put together by fans.<br /><br />I can only agree with J.J. Abrams who created the two most recent Star Trek films, when he descibed Galaxy Quest as \\"One of the best Star Trek movies ever made.\\"
B008AWBQGM|5.0|the album content continues the great legacy that is Lynyrd Skynyrd. Their southern  country rock  continues to excite their loyal fans and brings new listeners to their style

B0036S4B6M|5.0|It was full of insight and was thought provoking on the Federal Prison System.  It left me wanting to know more on how Kerman got acclimated to life on the outside and if she kept in contact with her inmate friends.  I enjoyed the book much more than the Hollywood version on Netflix.
B002SKZBQS|2.0|A bit of a jumble. It is king writing but the end could be concluded well before half way somewhat boring
B00E03ULJS|5.0|I love this album, and I'm sooooo happy it's finally out.  I've been a fan since around January I want to say.  Krewella personally made sure my younger brother and I made it to their Atlanta performance in May.  I was eternally grateful and shocked at how much they love their fans!<br /><br />I have never been much of a fan girl of any one group, because I normally like one song by an artist maybe a few.  But with Krewella I love almost every song they make.  When you listen to them and close your eyes, you can get lost in the lyrics and beautiful rhythms and melodies.  It's a very nice escape from the daily toil life can take on us.<br /><br />I love that they don't stick to one genre and write whatever the hell they want to.  I've never seen more 'real' artists, with such a passion for what they do.  They don't aim to be famous or rich, they just want to make music.<br /><br />Also thank you amazon for sending me the CD a day early :)<br /><br />Buy it, you won't regret it
B008ETOSYI|2.0|Nicolas Sparks is known for his romance orientated repertoire. Not many people are ever in the mood to cry and dwell on the fact that they do not have picture-perfect relationships, like the ones portrayed in his work. Some of his pieces are better than the others, and no doubt about it, the \\"The Lucky One\\" is not one of his best.<br /> The plot in general is truly not entertaining or anything we have not seen before. Logan (Zac Efron), is a U.S. marine on tour and somehow finds an untouched picture in the rubble of the aftermath of a bomb. How original. Not surprisingly, he hardly reacts or shows any emotion to this picture. If it were not for the dialogue, you would have no idea how he feels about this woman. Through unrealistically surviving a series of events, he considers the woman in the picture a good luck charm so he sets out to find her when he returns home. As if it is easy, Logan simply figures out who this woman is and walks, yes walks, from Colorado to Louisiana. From this point, anyone who has seen a movie with a man looking for love can predict how the movie will play out.<br /> It is not only the same old boring plot, but the actors themselves contribute to the hackneyed story. Beth (Taylor Schilling), the woman in the picture, and Logan do not connect nor have that chemistry you would hope a romance movie would have. They are complete opposites when it comes to passion and excitement. When they first meet, Efron is soft spoken and has a dull tone of voice that does not change as the story line continues and attempts to heat up. He also holds the same quiet, tiresome facial expression throughout the movie, even during the rare parts you are dying for some emotion from such an attractive man.  Schilling, on the other hand, acts like the average human being, with appropriate reactions to what life throws at her, but what affect does she have when Efron is unemotional individual who is not holding up his part.<br /> Because it is in the romance genre, the connection is presumed to be between Logan and Beth, but Logan appears to be more concerned with winning over Ben's (Beth's son) friendship than Beth's heart. When Logan visits their house, Ben is almost immediately in the picture and Logan tends to be more caught up in playing with him. Logan smiles, laughs, and his face and eyes light up, which becomes uncomfortable when he shows more compassion towards Ben, when Beth is in the background watching it all, wishing it were her getting that attention. Sure, it is charming to see a handsome man bond with a young boy, but not when you are looking for a powerful relationship between two lost people, subconsciously looking for love.<br />The worst part is when you have to admit you actually look forward to Ben's father, Keith, make his appearances. He is a malicious man with a remotely small part but he brings drama and stimulation the movie is desperate for. Nothing new there, divorced parents and the father playing the bad guy. He becomes jealous of Beth and Logan's so called, relationship, and taunts Logan. Of course Logan does not defend himself, which does not aid in the lack of thrill.<br /> The actors in the movie are not poor actors, but they are not well suited for their parts in \\"The Lucky One\\" by any means. The plot is one that can relate to many other movies, just add a few small, uneventful twists and you get a feeble, unoriginal movie that more than likely will not keep you interested enough to stay awake.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|Interesting character for Mr. McConaughey and he did it well. I enjoyed this movie. Not an academy movie or performance however.

B009NX409M|4.0|DeNiro and Streep are both engaging - hard to take your eyes off of them. However the love story seems unfulfilled. It is also a bit confusing as to why they got together - both being so different. Mostly it seems that they come together because they are unhappy in their current lives.
0761171703|5.0|This book is so inspirational  With the world &#34;today&#34; this book shows you in pictures what you have forgotten what it was to see the world through innocent eyes.  If you're happy, sad or just want a lift for the moment.  This book is a must have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow!! I just finished the very last sentence of this novel and I am in awe!! What an original story, set of characters, and imagination! I'm a sucker for GOOD science fiction and I take pride in being very selective, so I finally broke down and decided to read this novel and see what all the fuss was about. Can I say that I was an idiot for not reading this sooner and I am not ashamed to admit it?<br />I was hooked from the very first page and I gobbled up the story like I haven't done with any other novel in years. I'm a US Navy submarine veteran and the author perfectly caught the atmoshpere of living and working in a world without fresh air and sun where the drone of life support machinery, electronics, food preparation, and conversation is a constant background noise.<br />I can't wait to read the other \\"Silo\\" universe books and you can count on me as being a huge Hugh Howey fan. BUY this book!!!!!

So different from us yet he allows us to see that inspite of these differences we all have that need of love, family and a sense of self.

Different language, different customs, different God yet &#34;the basics&#34; are all there and we're not so different or far apart afterall!

111846446X|4.0|Originally picked up a Raspberry Pi to do the &#34;Retro Pie&#34; project.  While I got that working, I was also thinking of other potential uses for the Pi.  There are loads of ideas out there on the internet but I wanted a book to sit down and go over because I like paper in my hands.<br /><br />A lot of subjects are covered by this book.  How to get started, installing an OS, simple projects to do, etc.  This is a good book for somebody with little knowledge of Linux and hardware but it will not turn you into a guru.  It is easy to follow, there are some pictures, and there is a wide range of project ideas listed.<br /><br />The biggest drawback of this book is that the chapters are short and don't go into extensive detail past the initial project setup stage.  That's OK because the whole idea of the Pi is to explore computing without worry but if you desire more details you will be left wanting.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  It'd be a good companion purchase if you are gifting the Pi and wanted to ensure that your giftee could easily get into it.  If you already own a Pi or are comfortable with terminal/command prompt then you will want to look for another book.

So, if you liked their last album, you'll love this one too, trust me you won't be disappointed.

1476727651|5.0|While I'm an avid SK fan, I wasn't sure what to expect of what can be considered a sequel, or a continuation of the story of Danny Torrence.  It had been years since I read The Shining or had seen the movie.  When I preordered the book, I decided to re-read The Shining to prepare, but work and home life took precedence.  Then suddenly a couple days ago I received my preorder shipment email.  Too late now...<br /><br />With that said, I really enjoyed Doctor Sleep.  The story was very compelling...lost quite a bit of sleep the last couple of nights trying to knock it out.  The first night, after 1AM and having to work the next day, I realized I was already (only) half way through.  Too much left to read for that night.  Last night I stayed up until 2AM to finish it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the pupil-becomes-the-teacher story arc.  I enjoyed some of the twists, even if they were foreshadowed a bit, but not so much so that it was obvious.<br /><br />If you are looking for classic SK chills, gore and frights, this is not that type of book.  The tone is different than I recall from The Shining.  However, the storytelling is still top-notch with higher-brow suspense instead of scream-in-your-face shock and horror.<br /><br />The conclusion(?) of the The Shining storyline was well worth the wait.

B00D6DVSAE|2.0|For an artist to sway from the course of expectations and to create something new and fresh, something that strays from past formula, is to be applauded.  Unfortunately, this album strays so far from the path of Sting's previous endeavors that it really should have been sold as a soundtrack to the theatrical presentation (as explained in other reviews).  As someone that is a HUGE Sting/Police fan, but does not really enjoy Broadway-type theatrical numbers, or pub songs (unless I'm in the pub singing them), this album came as a big disappointment.  I don't expect an artist to never grow, evolve their music, and I respect his desire to bring focus to a part of his life that is so important to him and his development; however, this is so far from anything that he has ever done before that it really should have been branded/sold differently.  I don't expect my favorite electronica artist to put out a punk album or a rap artist to suddenly release a country album, and this comes equally as a shock.  I guess I should have known better and actually listened to samples first-- my fault.  But come on-- this album strays so far stylistically from everything else that he has ever done that it really is confusing.  As other reviewers state, \\"REVIEW\\" before buying.

0143121421|5.0|The Spy Who Came In From the Cold was John le Carre's third published novel and the one that thrust him into the literary limelight.  It's told in the third person and features a protagonist named Alec Leamas.  Leamas is a veteran officer in British Intelligence whose recent sojourn as a spy network coordinator has proven to be less than successful.  He agrees to accept one last assignment, a difficult and dangerous one.  If things go according to plan his efforts will result in bringing down East Germany's feared and ruthless spymaster, the loathesome Comrade Mundt.<br /><br />This is a suspenseful, page turner of a book which shows the ambiguous world of espionage in an extremely ugly light.  The actions of the good guys are often as immoral as those of the bad.  A must read for all afficionados of spy novels.  Dark, exciting, exquisitely plotted, groundbreaking.  Very highly recommended.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|The brief synopsis sounded like a good movie, but when we sat down to watch it, it just was not very good at all. It jumped from story line to story line, but not in a way that made sense. Kind of disappointed because do enjoy watching Tom Hanks most of the time.

B0089LOG02|4.0|3.5 of 5 stars,<br />Molly, a seventeen-year-old foster child with an attitude is sentenced to community service, helping an elderly woman clean and organize her attic, rather than being sentenced to juvie. Ninety-one-year-old Vivian became road The Orphan Train as a nine-year-old to find a family after hers perished in a fire.<br />While going through boxes, Vivian shares her story with Molly, and the two form an unlikely friendship.<br />Normally, I don't like historical fiction, but I enjoyed the parts of the Vivian's story set between the 1920s-40s. When I was a young girl, I watched a weekly TV program called The Orphan Train about this fascinating slice of American history. I, however, could not connect to Molly and her bad attitude, even though I empathized with her circumstance.<br />While the story kept my interest, because of Vivian, the writing felt at times uninspired, with too much telling and not enough showing.  I'd read other books by the writer if the topic interested me, I'd search for bargain kindle prices.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I've been a hardcore Dream Theater fan since shortly after the release of their landmark 1992 release \\"Images & Words\\". I greatly enjoyed the 1994 followup \\"Awake\\", didn't care all that much for the \\"A Change of Seasons\\" pesudo e.p., greatly enjoyed 1997's \\"Falling into Infinity\\" (a very underrated release in my opinion) and also thought that 1999's \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory\\" was a very strong and focused released with only a few weak moments near the end.<br /><br />After that point starting with 2002's \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\", the band began to lose me as a fan. I thought that release was bloated and with the exception of the first couple of tracks on disc one, uninteresting and boring. 2003's \\"Train of Thought\\" was a bit of an improvement but I still found it lacking in any sort of general songwriting prowess. 2005's \\"Octavarium\\" was much more commercial and streamlined and I found it to be a most pleasing release. However, 2007's \\"Systematic Chaos\\" would repeat a lot of the same mistakes that I felt that band had made on TOT and SDOIT. Finally, 2011's \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\" which would be drummer and co-founder Mike Portnoy's final release before quitting the band had some strong moments but was bloated beyond belief and consisted of nothing but self indulgent wankery and laughable lyrics in my opinion.<br /><br />If appears though with 2011's \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\", that Portnoy leaving the band being replaced by the wonderful Mike Mangini was the creative shot in the arm that Dream Theater needed. Gone were the annoying mall core backing vocals that Portney seemed to try to throw into every song and that attempts at trying to be heavier than they should be and intead it was replaced by a renewed sense of songcraft, melody and purpose. It was my favorite release since 1999's Scenes from a Memory. The band though didn't include Mangini in the writing process for the album as they wanted to prove to the world that they could do it on their own without Portnoy in my eyes.<br /><br />Now, with the release of 2013's self titled release, Dream Theater have clearly completely gotten their mojo and creative sense of purpose back with a vengeance. Mangini was included in the songwriting on this album and it shows. Like ADTOE, the band has a sense of melody once again that had been lacking for a while. Also, with the exception of the epic 22 minute closer \\"Illumination Theory\\", most songs fall around 5 minutes to a little under 7 minutes in length. In fact, the opening symphonic opening track \\"False Awakening Suite\\" is under 3 minutes! The album also features a fantastic instrumentel as track 4 \\"Enigma Machine\\". But even the multi-part epic closing track on the album is well written, arranged and just well though out. Lyrically, it's also one of their best to date as well.<br /><br />Vocalist James Labrie turns in another fantastic performance on this release as with ADTOE, he just seems comfortable in his own musical skin again and is playing to his strengths at this stage in his long career. Guitarist John Petrucci and keyboard Jordan Rudess reign in a bit the overly complex and jarring dual lead breaks and instead use them to spice up a particular track at the right moment. Bassist John Myung has a crisp and very commanding tone throughout and gets several moments to shine. Mike Mangini also turns in a fantastic drum performance showing once again why he was the perfect replacement for Mike Portnoy.<br /><br />The mix on the self titled release is better than ADTOE and in particular the drums sound greatly improved. The album also wasn't brickwalled during the mastering process so the music is allowed to breathe so actual dynamics in all of the tracks are easily discernible.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this new release stands as one of their overall best releases and completes their return to form that began with their previous studio release. This is a perfect album that shows whyDream Theater is the acclaimed band that they are and also works as a perfect entry point to somebody just getting into the band. It stands proud amongst their greatest classic releases and shows that they are still discovering new tricks over 2 decades into their career.<br /><br />Highly recommended!Dream Theater is the acclaimed band that they are and also works as a perfect entry point to somebody just getting into the band.

B00BHWG3GU|4.0|...it seems like something like this would have been done already, right? I mean, the idea is simple: Plop Allen Toussaint down at a piano in front of a lively but appreciative audience and let him loose. The result is positively charming for the casual listener, an invaluable history lesson for the neophyte, and an absolute master class in New Orleans R&B for the dedicated.<br /><br />Do we really need to go into the backstory? Toussaint is a titan of New Orleans soul/R&B, writing, producing, and arranging a seemingly endless stream of classics hits for way too many artists to list here...his impact on popular music is vast, but much of it bears the name of others. He always seemed content to work in the shadows and let the spotlight shine elsewhere. He was coaxed into a solo career in the late '60s and '70s, as documented by Rhino Handmade's \\"Complete Warner Recordings\\" set...<br /><br />Over the years, Toussaint's  own records have been hit-or-miss for me: His voice isn't capable of the grit of someone like Lee Dorsey or the emotional whallop of Irma Thomas (both of whom he wrote and produced some tremendous records for), and sometimes the performances lacked a certain spark. Still, he's such a witty and imaginative writer and absolutely majestic pianist (giving the rollicking syncopation of Professor Longhair a certain regal grace) that he's rarely dull. And in concert, he comes alive -- the '70s-vintage live set on \\"Complete Warner Recordings\\" was by far the best part of that package.<br /><br />This disk features live recordings cut in 2009 during his many solo gigs at Joe's Pub in New York City, where he was residing post-Katrina (he's since returned to New Orleans). His voice just grows in honeyed richness, and the live setting beautifully conveys his generous spirit and relaxed elegance. It's rare to hear Toussaint, usually in such complete control, relax and cut loose, playfully teasing the crowd and sprinkling his playing with all sorts of surprising riffs and runs...<br /><br />Naturally, most of the repertoire focuses on his classic tunes, and to hear them in this stripped down setting is a delight. Only occasionally does the presentation falter (\\"Yes We Can Can\\" feels a bit hurried). More often than not, the great man's warmth, intelligence, and simmering soulfulness shine through bright as day. And his pianism is fleet, nimble, and funky as ever. There's a bit of new material here, too -- all homages to New Orleans, which in less masterful hands would come off as cloying, but here just sound winsome and poetic. The elongated \\"Southern Nights\\" is captivating, too, as Toussaint gently accompanies a tender reminissence of childhood days.<br /><br />So yeah, buy it. The deluxe edition has more songs, and doesn't cost that much more (plus it has a DVD I've yet to watch), so I'd spring for that.<br /><br />I do have to say that Rounder/Concord really blundered the marketing and presentation of this music. The rather tepid cover -- a studio portrait of a zombie-like Toussaint at a piano -- does not convey the energy and grace of the recordings, nor does it inform the consumer that this is a live disk (you gotta read the back to figure that out). Also, Ace Records released a fine compilation called \\"Rolling with the Punches: The Allen Toussaint Songbook\\" a while back...why this disk had to have a near-identical title is beyond me. Hey, Rounder, it's called \\"Market Research.\\" Google it. Google anything, really...like the titles of your albums before you release them! Lastly, the packaging says that the \\"Certain Girl\\" medley contains the tune \\"Fortune Teller,\\" which is not heard as part of the medley. So maybe the Rounder folks should listen to the music too.<br /><br />Ok, enough rant...despite the lukewarm attention to detail in the packaging, this is a great disk and is already notching up a considerable number of plays at home and in the office...check it out!

B00F35BV64|1.0|If you want thrills, chills, and spills, witty dialogue and super special effects, then you're in for a treat.  If you want Star Trek - that very special saga of flawed but heroic characters working together to explore the unknown, to seek out new worlds and new civilizations, to show us the best of what we should aspire to become - then you've got the wrong movie. I was willing to go along with Abrams' update in his first movie, but this one just goes where.... actually, it goes nowhere, except to profitability and bastardization of what was once a true gem in television and cinematic literature.  Sure, there have been other movies and television episodes with the words \\"Star Trek\\" in the title that weren't so good; some of them weren't really Star Trek, either.  This movie is simply the most spectacular product to join that sad list.

Don't listen to those complaining saying it was nothing like the book. I read the book and it was about 80% same as the book and that's a lot. Most movies based on books are so altered. This one was only slightly altered and I liked that because after you read a book, you don't want the movie to be exactly like it because then it won't be as enjoyable because it would be way too predictable! And those saying it was Sleeping with the Enemy...no it wasn't! This one was a beautiful love story, Sleeping with the Enemy was just okay.<br />If you like movies that pull at your heart-strings, then this is a good one for you!

B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The shining is one of the scariest books I ever read. It caused me many a sleepless night. Unfortunately, although this is Danny, the scares just aren't there. Mr. King mentions, at the end of the book, that people have changed, as has he, since the original work. I actually felt like he had taken some sort of bet about being able to make anything scary. Unfortunately this subject, RV travelers, was never scary, and he was unable to make it so. In this book he trades the terror of the Overlook Hotel for a band of traveling oldsters. Of course, they are not what they seem, but they are also never terrifying. I read the book in a little over a day. Mr. King's writing style is still superb and he makes an excellent book, but this one Falls short of even the lowest expectations. I believe that another factor that diminishes any scares is that the little girl in the book is too strong and you are never really afraid for her. Unlike the helpless and vulnerable Danny, she is almost godlike in power so you never develop the type of worry for her you had for Danny. I had high hopes for this book and though I'm sure Mr. King did not want to simply redo the scares of his original, I believe he may have been better off, and better served his readers, by doing so.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Would recommend it to anyone, easy to use. Easy to understand.  Go ahead, download it, you will like it - I promise
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Out of the three movies made on Iron, this is by far the worst in poor editing, writing and plot. A kid in third grade could do a better job. It is obvious that this movie was created for the purposes of making more money from this movie series.  There is no plot and very little substance. If you want to watch this movie, wait for it to be release from a major network like FX, so you can watch for free. For now, I hope that my comments will prevent others from suffering from a terrible case of buyer's remorse for renting this movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This app has a lot of free puzzles and puzzles on sale. The app is great! Keeps you busy and never gets old.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick, you've done it again. Well written, suspenseful, action packed. Definitely one of my all time favorite books I have ever read
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I was skeptical about this movie since I don't care for superhero movies. When I actually watched it, it turns out that I really liked this movie! As a girl, I recommend it for everyone and it is fun to watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really great game. Very addictive and good for the whole family. Kids loved this game. Love the new levels that have been added.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is challenging, but so much fun. I could play this all day. I especially like to play the same people in multiple games. This is a classic game for all
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Metallica always brings it live. I have seen them twice and they will blow anyone off the stage. The soundtrack is awesome and I cant wait to see the movie. Keep it up Metallica.
B0024RID6U|5.0|Some of their most memorable music is on this CD/Album. The quality couldn't be better than &#34;Get Your Ya-Ya's Out&#34;. My favorite is Keith Richard's &#34;T and A (My Sweet Little Rock and Roller)&#34;. The earlier Stones will always be my favorites. New, fresh and relatively without the later drug destructiveness of their music.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Why don't they make more moving movies like this these days instead of all sex and murder, blood and guts.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|If you want to build your music library and don't know the name, singer, group, alblum, or title of the song, Shazam will tell you all of that at the touch of your phone and fast. For a free app, Shazam is great!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A fun, interesting and wonderfully done movie I gave as a gift to a friend who is housebound.  He absolutely loved it and wants a sequel.
B00F5PS5P2|5.0|I was really looking forward to hearing this album, based on the strength of the singles that preceded it, all of which stuck firmly in my head after a single listen and have held up to repeated listening.  I wasn't disappointed, and now have a full album of great melodies, beats and lyrics stuck in my head!  Catchy on first listen, all the songs are solid, and layered both musically and lyrically.  The spotlight on the band often falls justifiably on Lauren's vocals, but the full album really shows off the contributions and range of all three members, and their ability to craft great music.  This is intelligent and carefully constructed pop music.  It feels like the band has taken notes on all the electronic music of the past 30-40 years, from Moroder through the pop & industrial of the 80's and 90's, up through contemporary hip hop and EDM, and found a way to put the best of that together with the best of pop music in general, with a spin of their own, and just the right balance of instrument and voice.  Sounds that could be tongue-in-cheek retro references by another band here sound perfectly placed and of the moment.  The songs that have been released earlier remain excellent, yet don't distract from the album, as nearly all the new songs match them in quality.  Tether is especially gorgeous, and songs like We Sink, Under the Tide, Lungs and others are irresistible, driving and kinetic.  Don't miss out on the bonus tracks, Strong Hand and Broken Bones.
B0094M0P4G|4.0|She makes this movie great with her singing the other young lady is good but goes to far with the waredrob malfunction and sleeping with men.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I used and cleared a lot of internal memory that needed to be cleared.  so far so good we will see how it continues to work out
B006PIXKVW|3.0|good story decent casting for the characters and has its moments I would watch it again but it was fine the first time
B004MC0FO8|4.0|It has correctly identified every song i've tried it with.  Amazing technology.  It may have one bug, need to try it our more.
B00722Y1EK|2.0|I paid $1.99 but must have received the FREE version, since my version shows Ads. As a 'always on' the screen display, it is far too small to be of use. If you make it larger, it affects currently running App. Might be ok for a full size DeskTop or LapTop screen. Not that effective on Smart Phone or Tablet. So overall, NOT that cool...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Regardless if you like Stephen King's writing or the subject matter or even the characters, you have to admit that he knows how to tell a great story. I have read every book Stephen King has ever written and I started reading them at age 12. The one thing that I found remarkable even then was his ability to tell a good story. Doctor Sleep is no exception. The book is very different and isn't so much a sequel to The Shining, but a new story created because of The Shining. I started reading this book and haven't been able to put it down.<br />It was not particularly scary in my opinion but it was very spooky if that makes any sense. I think when people think of a \\"Stephen King book\\" you automatically assume it's going to scare the living day lights out of you. This book was more the phantom whisper that you hear in the night and not so much the banging on the walls that wakes you up.<br />I don't want to give too much away about the plot or story line but I will say that the book is very engrossing. The characters are so well developed and the actual story-telling ( which is what I consider Mr. King, a story teller) is very good. If you're like me and you have a very vivid imagination and a love for story-telling you will no doubt enjoy this book. Just one disclaimer: Please don't compare this book to the move or expect it to be a continuation of the Overlook Hotel's story. While a book dedicated to the people of the Overlook and their demise would be AMAZING, this is not that book.<br /><br />Constant readers enjoy!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|My husband and I have seen this movie a few times and have always enjoyed it. I had read the books and am anxious for the next movie...
B00007ELEL|4.0|This movie will never get old. Always refreshing to look at months or years after seeing it for the first time. You must watch to appreciate.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|My son and his friends all have this app and love it!  He said it has helped him to be a better magic player and understand the cards. He reccomends it to anyone wanting to learn.
039472903X|4.0|I was never much into advertising, but after mad man I found myself pulled into wanting to know how the other side lives. This was an interesting first hand grash of how it goes in the ad world.
B00DM11LV6|5.0|It's about trust and being true to yourself. Not usually a fan of lesbian movies. The two came into each other's lives unexpected.
B00003003R|4.0|GNR will always be relevant. It is because of the people who bought their cd's in the 80's and continue to rock to their lyrics and tunes.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Kids loved seeing this movie and we loved the flash back to our own child hood's. We'll be looking for more movies of yester-year to share with our kiddos.
B00065MDRW|4.0|I am a late arriver to KC. They are different, yet I am very connected to their music through Bruford and through their lryics. I am glad I made the move to KC.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|this movie is awesome graphics too the possibilities of what can happen in the world  are just endless a must watch movie
B00007KWHP|4.0|Something to add to my collection. Big Bruford fan and have accumulated some early, some mid and his most recent music. He is quite the artist as are the other members of Yes.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Much daughter loves to play this very interesting game. I also like playing. I think the graphics are wonderful, and I love the way it teaches about the different fish
B00F35B8F8|3.0|One of the worst Amazon streamed movies that i have watch, the beginning was almost un-watchable, even after reseting my equipment, but it did get better as it played but certainly not the best.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I just like that all. And it is fun game I considered a profesional app for any<br />Caín ofrece of person.
B0041D843M|5.0|I read this book in conjunction with &#34;Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease&#34; by doctor Esselstyn. very compelling description of how food affects our health. I have now started to eat vegan and my children have changed their eating habits also.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Want to read everything he writes. Lots of plot twists. Just wonderful. Great characters. Always unexpected.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|You will want To plAy this game for hours . I know because i have.try this game  ifyou enjoy playing an action game.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|It's not a new story, but it's very relevant to our modern world.  Raises some interesting questions.  Do we need competition?  What about all those kids connected by their smartphones?
B00915G6R6|4.0|Good season, but wish I'd gotten a better deal on the price. Hard to re-sell it, so wished I'd waited to get it cheaper.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|McConaughey terrific as a man living on the fringes, fending for himself on an island. Incredible performances by the young boys who discover Mud and try to help him. You will be bowled over by the older boy, Tye Sheridan. This film leaves the viewer with a real sense of what life might be like somewhere in the deep south backwater.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Got on sale, so very pleased with the sale. Good first season, looking forward to the latest season on TV for free!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this story. Can't wait to read more. Very intense. Even a little love story in there. Highly recommend!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First I lived it, then I stopped living it because I knew I loved it. I really butterflying loved it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a great story. Me daughter read this for summer reading and it touched at her heart strings. I had to read it and it did the same to me and my wife.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|I said I was not watching one more zombie movie however I caved to watch this one and the storyline was a little more interesting than most.  I'm still not building a bunker or storing 10 years worth of food and water in preparation for the end of the world.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|All good for the kids and adults to. They are all having a ball eith this games and keeping busy when bored
B006LSZECO|1.0|I hoped this would get better but it didn't.  I hated everything about this book!  Honestly it deserves 0 stars but I cannot post without at least 1.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My daughter loved this book and has discussed it several times with us and her friends. They enjoy talking about it.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|If you like Jack Johnson, you will love this new release! He stays true to form. Unlike some artists that seem to feel the need to reinvent their style or sound, Jack keeps it consistent and consistently good. The lyrics are catchy and resonate. The tunes and guitar playing sticks in your head. I can't get Shot Reverse Shot out of my head right now. :-)<br /><br />If you have listened to Jack Johnson in the past and don't care for his clear lyrics and fundamental guitar playing, you won't like this collection either. But I'm an avid (amateur) acoustic guitar player and think he's great. I hope he tours in the San Francisco Bay area soon!
0425170349|5.0|This book kept me iterested all five days it took me to read it. I was on vacation and read it while on the beach. Great one.
B00CKH9WOQ|4.0|Catty Noir Is Purrfect In Every Way Except Her Hair Feels A Little Greasy & It Is Really Knotted. Also She Only Came With The Bar Of Her Stand, No Base. How Is Does That Happen? Her Packaging Looked Unfaultered So I Have To Think While Being Put In box The Person Failed To Insert The Base. Over all Doll Is Perfect except Greasy & knotted hair with no base.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I have to admit, I'm one of those (or maybe the only one) who wrote the release date of this CD on my calendar!  I became a fan of Avenged Sevenfold back when they released &#34;Nightmare&#34; and came to town to do a show.  The song &#34;So Far Away&#34; was played constantly on the local rock station and I loved it from the start, then when listening to the DJ interview M Shadows, he just totally grabbed my interest and the hunt was on for any bit of A7X I could find.  Strangely enough, my son gave me his copy of &#34;City of Evil&#34; to load to my iTunes and the rest is history. He laughs at my obsession with them, but I'm quick to remind him that he helped fuel that fire! Okay, on to &#34;Hail to the King&#34;, and I'm not reviewing the songs in any particular order...you are immediately drawn in by &#34;Shepherd of Fire&#34; and the genius doesn't stop until the last song.  Oh, but then that is not even the end because of the downloadable bonus track &#34;St. James&#34; that isn't on the disc.  I'm hard pressed to name a favorite song on this CD because they are all so amazingly written and played.  &#34;Doing Time&#34; is just fun and, I believe, is the only song with any profanity, which is unusual for Avenged.  &#34;This Means War&#34; has hints of Metallica, in my opinion.  &#34;Crimson Day&#34; and &#34;Acid Rain&#34; are the closest things to ballads, &#34;Heretic&#34; is upbeat and grabs onto you, and this quickly became one of my favorites, as did &#34;Coming Home&#34;.  &#34;Planets&#34;, &#34;Requiem&#34; and &#34;Hail to the King&#34; round out the line-up of this completely amazing collection.  Be sure to download the bonus track &#34;St. James&#34;, which is a tribute to the Rev.  Matt Sanders' voice has never sounded better, Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance collaborate beautifully and the bass of Johnny Christ is felt as deeply as new drummer Arin Ilejay's intense beat.  Arin is filling big shoes taking the place of Jimmy, but I can see on thisCD that he will have absolutely no problem making his own way as a drummer.  He's awesome!  My first thought was that this CD was so much harder and darker, but after having listened to it about a thousand and one times so far, it's still classic Avenged.  These guys totally rock and are just getting better and better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best! You can find ideas on Anything. I absolutely Love how easy it is, then is gives a bunch of similar suggestions.  One fall back is you may sit and search for an hour or so without even knowing it. I would recommend Pinterest to any and everyone!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|My wife, who hates zombie films, actually enjoyed this ride.  Aside from the necessary implausibilities, it kind of worked, and it was nice to see more than the typical slow-moving, people-munching zombie-types
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game lots of fun and very addicting. only thing bad I have this add that keeps loping up and it wont clear unless I back out the game and it keeps doing it over and over every time I get on now. very annoying.
0061122416|5.0|is been translate to a lot of languages and theres no doubt about it this shows how to follow your destiny be strong be patience persistence and at the end you be reward for it and many ways this book is so deep that theres no enough words to describe it you just gotta read it and read it all till the end and then become your own hero take it as a fantasy book take it as auto help book take it as an a true story  it doesnt really matter you will love it anyways.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|Love this new album and was so excited to finally get another great JJ track.  There haven't been any songs by Jack Johnson/Ben Harper that I haven't enjoyed listening to at some point.  Kick back, relax and enjoy the beautifully simple sounds of Jack Johnson.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|This game, whilst quite addictive, is terribly slow going unless you are willing to spend real money, and that can add up surprisingly quickly. Also very repetitive. Sorry g5, I don't really think it's worth the effort.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The packaging is weird and a little cumbersome, but not at all inconvenient (and it takes up less space this way!). I haven't seen this show since it first came out and only watched a few seasons at that time. This is such a funny, laugh-out-loud show!!!!!! I am so glad I have this in my collection--in my opinion, a true classic!!! Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal are AMAZING actors!!!
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|I felt a part of the story and action all the way through the movie, good story line, great direction.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my first book by author. Now I want to read her others. I read this book because of good things I heard from a good friend of mind that read slammed and Point of no return.
B0037YOMWS|4.0|I needed a replacement for my HP 10B after many many years of faithful service.  I wanted another HP product.  The HP-30B is way more horsepower than I will likely ever need. In my world I tend to do more complicated financial or mathematical work on a spreadsheet. Everyone's phone has a simple calculator.  Did I really need the 30B?  No, but having said that I really like the look and feel of this calculator. In time I will learn to use more of the functions.  The price was reasonable.  So for now I would say that I am pleased with this purchase.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I just finished reading this book for the first time and plan on reading it several more times as well as sharing it with my 11 year old granddaughter who is an avid reader. Loved it!
B007EC27QM|4.0|It performs the four basic functions, has large easy to read keys, fast processing and the review of entries is essential.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show! New twists and turns with each episode. Characters are developing nicely with some great depth to what initially appeared as one dimensional characters.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|In I don't know how many books Reacher, an MP, says he was trained to deal with trained killers.  He kicks ass (literally).
B000MXJ7LS|5.0|I beleive this is nicolas cage's best acting performance.great cast all around. years from now people will agree.give it some time...
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like it, it's my first time playing but it was easy to use and figure out how to play. It's a lot of fun.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|I didn't actually install this one. As soon as I saw what it wanted access to, I stopped. Beware folks! Your privacy is worth much more than a free app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is by far the best game out there!!! It is so much fun!! I cant put it down!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Such a great book, enjoyable reading for both women and men.<br />Fantasy story that we all dream of happening to us.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Keeps me busy &amp; de-stresses me. I can count on the game being there especially when I need time for &quot;me&quot; so I don't turn into a raving nut to others. We all need sometime for ourselves just to get our minds off of things that we just want to either alone or to clear our heads. That is what I am able to accompolish when I play Spider.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Having listened to all of Aim and Ignite and this album, and seen Fun. in concert, I'm excited to see what they will release next.  As a classic rock fan, I'm a bit older than the demographic that Fun. usually sees, but there are definitely parts of various songs on both albums that remind me of ELO and Queen.  I love &#34;Carry On.&#34;  Although &#34;One Foot&#34; has not gotten radio airplay, I find it catchy. (it's a good song to run to).  I love &#34;Why Am I the One?&#34;  And, of course, &#34;We Are Young&#34; and &#34;Some Nights&#34; deserve their popularity.  Even &#34;All Alright&#34; and &#34;All Alone&#34; which I think are the weaker tracks on the album are still good songs.
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Most of the reviews I have read have been rating Jalen's acting as so bad but the script is bad.  It seems so childish in many ways, particularly the scenes with the large bird and when it protects him, come on, that is too far fetched.  The movie just doesn't convince you that is it is real as a good movie should, whether it is scifi or a crime drama, etc.  I am really disappointed.  I gave it a try because I read a few good reviews, now I wish I had waited till I could have rented it instead of bought it.  My bad.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|So cool but they say a lot of bad guess words and they say it when they don't need to but I still like it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent book! Read this for bookclub and it made for a great discussion. Surprising ending and great style of writing.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This movie was great fun and enjoyable to watch. Loved the characters, actors playing them, the plot, and overall the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book! I immediately was enthralled with this book and found that I couldn't wait to get back to reading it anytime I had a break in the day. Very hard to put down. Looking forward to reading next book of series.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I going to remove it from my phone, I have to recharge my phone before noon, and I haven't even been using it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book tells the true story of a young woman on an adventure that most would never consider doing. Very well written, and hard to put down. This was a book club read and it made for great discussion.
0470913029|1.0|There's a lot to talk about here, but I'll be brief and give you some direction as to where the author want you to think. It talks about protein A LOT but to claim our ancestors didn't eat ANY dairy or nuts in the past is just lame. Sure, some things like eggs and nuts are not as high as turkey and venison in protein, but to say you can't eat what WAS available back then is utter bull____. I got halfway through this book and put it down, swearing not to finish it. I don't know what the author's influences are, but they are wrong, nuts and berries existed 10,000 years ago as well as fresh eggs and pork. This newly revised version of the diet looks to be heavily influenced by an outside source (perhaps she found a sponsor with an agenda?) and makes no common sense. There are many dietary recommendations that conflict with each other day by day. One day THIS could be bad, but the next, it's healthy for you. Stay away from this book as I've found the secret to dieting: put the effing fork down. There, I'm shedding weight already.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|One of my favorite books since I was a teenager.  With the digital edition, now I can jump into it whenever I feel like visiting Thornfield Hall. Richer than any video adaptation out there.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|it is a very nice game when I was playing my child had seen me playing this game she forced me to download this game in her kindle also ;)
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This book is a must read if you want to be more effective in your job, in your relationship and in life!<br />Everyone I know should take the assessment test and use the book to better themselves
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I first looked at reviews for this game, I fought it would be a very hard game for me to play and I wanted to delete it.  As I began to play Temple Run 2, it became very clear to me that is was going to be a suspenseful game filled with action and thinking skills.<br /><br />This game is great, and it also keeps me aware of the big monkey behind me!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice App. I've always liked Accuweather for its accurate weather info, seeing the same I the Android app. However, again cannot help comparing with the iPad app that I've used earlier. The tab option on that app which you can slide to see the hourly weather is cool. Missing it in this app.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|Very informative and step by step instructions on hair styling and maintenance. It helped me to understand how to take care and style my curly hair!
B00499NHLC|5.0|The cases are complex and perplexing.  Watching Sherlock work out the solutions keeps you on the edge if your seat.  Benedict Cumberpatch is mesmerizing as Sherlock Holmes.  Don't miss this show!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Marcus Zusak is and amazing writer. His books are difficult to put down, beautifully written and you fall in love with his  characters.<br />I just found this story terribly sad. His other book, I Am the Messenger, is a must read.
B00E0SXNE8|4.0|i rated this film four stars because the movie shows the value of family and the love for family and accepting change for the family's sake.+
B000B5XOQQ|5.0|This is the original cassic version of the beauty and the beast and probably the first to use a landmark as a base (the Empire State Building). It ha spawned a remke and the basis for another scie-fi movie.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|Thank you for Making a release date for Despicable Me 2 on December 10, 2013. And there is a new cover.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Made on a back lot at Warner Bros this piece captures the essence of the early &#34;40s, with a poignant love story woven into the story. Wonderful acting by all involved, especially Bogart.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|very funny, interesting, witty I like the bantering with Mike and Harvey and Donna.  Rachael and Donna's friendship.  The bnatering of havery and Louis
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series.......never know what is coming next.  Who would have thought a soap from the 1920's could be such a draw!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old girls and I love it and so do the girl's so I would 100% Chance buy it
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Awesome.  CLACE!!!  MALEC!!! SIZZY!!! I ship it (them). Super good. Now I am on to book # 4  Yay !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In subway surfer world tour you're in Moscow,Russia and you have to collect these nesting dolls ever week. After you collect them all you get a random prize. Sometimes it's keys, or mega head starts, or anything.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Personally I enjoyed this read, it had a good pace and I enjoyed the dark personalities featured.<br />You find yourself backing both protagonists at different parts of the adventure, but overall neither of the characters are particularly likable.<br />The ending could have been a little more definitive, but I can understand the authors reasoning.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so fun but the shark gets too hungry for me but still it's better than all my dress up games!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really makes you use your brain. The first couple of levels are pretty easy. Then they really start making you think. I highly recommend this game.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|I bought this cd for my daughter because she is a huge fan of Big Time Rush.I was very pleased with it! It came sooner than I thought and it is in a very good(excellent) condition!She loved it! It's one of the buys that are worthy of the money.Her friends usually come over and listen to it 24/seven..(literally!)
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is awesome I love it btw get the moon it is 175000 coins on the game but its worth it
B0079XPUOW|1.0|Parodies are a difficult thing to do.<br /><br />I got this book a while ago based on another authors recommendation, but it wasn't worth the time to finish.<br /><br />I am glad I didn't know it was the same author as \\"Old Mans War\\" otherwise I would have never read the series based on this book, and that is a damn fine series.<br /><br />I'll give some of his other sci-fi or action a chance, but pass on any further attempts he has at humor.
1848549245|4.0|I have read several motivational books over the years but few have struck the chord with me that \\"The One Thing\\" did.<br /><br />I was actually a little skeptical about even reading the book at first. The authors did not necessarily seem to have the credentials that would lead me to believe that what they had to say was significant or important. But I quickly realized my fears were unfounded.<br /><br />By following the strategy of \\"the one thing\\" you will learn how to reduce the complexity of making decisions in your life. You'll eventually learn how productive it can be to reduce what seems like overwhelmingly complex choices by focusing your time and energy on \\"the one thing\\" that is most important.<br /><br />The approach sounds simplistic and the reality is, it is a bit simplistic. But fundamentally the simple method of focusing on \\"the one thing\\" helps you reduce the clutter that would otherwise obscure your path and complicate the decision making process.<br /><br />In short, this book motivates you and helps you become focused on what you need to do to get things done, move forward, become successfull and get the results you desire.<br /><br />I was provided a reading copy of the book in exchange for my fair and honest review.
031606792X|1.0|Seriously, the whole series is terrible. It's just really, really awful. But I read the books when I was in middle school, which was the last time I was able to truly appreciate them. Then this book came out. The series I had loved was ruined forever. This book did more to make me hate Twilight than even the movie, and that's saying something. It's just awful.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a very good writer and his harry adventures have been a pleasure for both my wife and I to read.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|This album is fearless! Great production by Dan Auerbach coupled with the folky-bluesy-country-gospel stylings of Valerie June and her funky banjo uke or lap steel or guitar. I am blown away by the breadth and honesty of these performances and the atmospheric sounds of this great album. Couldn't recommend it more highly. Support this kind of non-auto-tuned, unpolished, real music!

B00D2CYU2W|1.0|Disgusting -- aside from making money, this film serves no purpose. This reminds me of tabloids that understand that sex sells. People are still cashing in on gossip about Liberace long after he is dead.<br /><br />Confession: I don't like lurid celebrity exploitation films in general, and in particular I thought Mike Douglas just could not pull off the role of Liberace and that this was an insult to Liberace's fans and to his memory.<br /><br />My grandmother was a great fan of Liberace and so when I was young I watched him a fair amount with her. Frankly I thought he was a joke and that his audience appeal was a big joke. Yet I did enjoy the music. And I have to say that I understand his personal appeal, even though it did not work for me. He came across as sincerely warm, gentle, playful, loving, and in a certain way he was his own man. For example he was not afraid to love and be devoted to his mother openly at a time when men were much more reserved about their feelings than they are today. He came across as an unashamed mama's boy -- and that was brave in those days, as were his glitzy costumes etc. The campy glitz and glamor were largely props or embellishments and what carried his fame was his personality.<br /><br />Douglas' performance conveyed none of that to me. There was almost always something cold and calculating behind the eyes even when he was performing. He did not seem like his own man. He seemed like a guy in drag trying too hard to prove something, to be something he was not but wanted to be. He played a gay stereotype more than the Liberace we used to see on television, who came across as a real human being -- though even a kid could see that he was probably gay and had a complicated and unhappy side behind the candelabra.  He seemed to be putting perhaps his best foot forward, and that is what people try to do. Nobody is all good feet. Did that make him a phoney? Not necessarily. Douglas may have worked his butt off to play the role and it wascertainly challenging, but that does not mean that his performance worked. it did not for me. It was too much a stereotype except for a few short scenes. Largely because of Douglas' unconvincing performance the film left one with the erroneous impression that Liberace had appeal because of the glitz alone, and not so much because of his warm and loving public persona. This angle would have been enough to ruin the film for me. But there is more.<br /><br />it did not take long for me to suspect that no one knew enough about Liberace's carefully closeted life or personal life in general to cast his character the way that they were doing. They were fleshing out freely their stereotypes of effeminate gays and of celebrity boy-toys. These were Hollywood show-biz easy characterizations, not necessarily the truth about specific human beings. Yes the Hollywood Las Vegas scenes are a mess, but still not everyone can be painted with the same brush. Was this a revelation about Hollywood using the name and superficial image of Liberace or a revelation about the flesh and blood Liberace?  It was only a few minutes into the film that I started wondering what I was watching.<br /><br />I did some googling. The facts were correct according to interviews with Scott Thorson, the boy-toy. Well, maybe and maybe not. Thorson seems terribly unreliable according to several sources, for example a May 10, 2013 New York Times article  [...] \\"He's not a bad person,\\" said Mr. Pelicone, who has a swirl of brown-blond hair and a cigarette habit. \\"He's just twisted and kind of cutthroat.\\"<br /><br />How much independent verification is there of the material in Thorson's book? Why should anyone care enough about his questionable book to make an expensive film and hire famous actors. It was a lot of work and money for what??? To cash in on lurid gossip about a most awkwardly closeted celebrity.<br /><br />But it is not the alleged facts that bother me as much as the spin that was given to the alleged facts. There can be several ways to present a fact. The plastic surgery matter sticks in my mind. The film left the impression at the moment when the subject came up that Liberace wanted Scott to look like him because of insane vanity. Then later there was the quite vague suggestion that he wanted to be able to pass him off as his son. Thorson has said that this was in fact the motive all along. None of this makes sense to me and this critical fact needs much more interpretation than anyone has given it. If Thorson is telling the truth, how was an unmarried celebrity supposed to have explained a biological son who was then to have been adopted?  Or was this as the film implies an act of insane vanity imposed on Thorson by Liberace? Or is there some secret that we cannot know that it was actually \\"twisted\\" Thorson who wanted to look like Liberace because he was star struck and wanted to be his sone and look like his mentor? Nothing adds up in the stories we are getting about the plastic surgery.<br /><br />It seems that no one can say much about Liberace and his boy-toy other than that Liberace was a tortured gay celebrity, closeted perhaps to the point of \\"paranoia,\\" and that he had a dependent close companion who was pretty screwed  up himself, and sometimes they probably did have sex. Scott was perhaps more conflicted about this than Liberace. One has to dig pretty hard to get this out of the film. Though one could argue that it is in there, I feel that it was a clumsy and un-artful exposition at best of a complex creative person and an unfortunate relationship.<br /><br />The actual historical situation could have been explored in much more depth and with much more sensitivity than it was in the film. To me the film just came across as yet more exploitation of the Liberace name -- first his managers and now the film makers and publishers of Thorson's book.<br /><br />Oh. Damon's performance was not bad.<br /><br />And Oh -- the \\"making of\\" feature on the discwas not bad. But again it was superficial and pandered too much to the sexual aspect, like \\"what was it like kissing a man and having your bare butt filmed?\\"

B008EKMB82|5.0|This was very entertaining and easy to read. Very enjoyable! Great writer and story. Two stories at the same time.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|The way the DVD was put together was terrible.  Side one which has the majority of the film when the boys were growing up and side two has the boys now adults getting back at the guards at the reformatory.  To watch the film in its entirity, it is very difficult to have to get up and flip the DVD over to play side two.  Each side is less than 4.7GB and it could have been recorded on one side for less than 8.5GB.<br />At the conclusion of the film there is a disclaimer by NY politicians that the film is purely fiction and that nothing about it ever happened.  The Author and Screenwriter disagrees and that he was a victim eventhough the characters, place, other characters are purely fiction.
B00AEBBADG|4.0|Thought I knew what I was buying, but got the 'ultimate director's cut' instead. Had I read the reviews before my purchase I would have looked for the original cut. As far as I can tell, everything is the same as the original except the added comic book segways. The movie didn't need these, but they aren't as terrible as some reviewers make them out to be. Still a good watch.

B00C6BA4SE|5.0|With well over 2000 reviews of [[ASIN:B00C6BA4SE Serenity (Steelbook) (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)]] it's unlikely that mine will even be read, but I wanted to add my voice to the legions of fans of the series [[ASIN:B001EN71CW Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]] and the film. I hadn't even heard of Firefly when it first aired, but stumbled upon it and with all of the positive reviews, took a chance. I was not disappointed. I spent the next two days watching the entire series and on the third day, watched the film. This is quality writing; witty, well thought out and consistent. I cared about the characters deeply, which is the mark of not only excellent acting, but quality writing. I would highly recommend that potential viewers first watch the series, then complete their experience with the film. The blu-ray has excellent video and audio and the supplemental package is also worthwhile. As a stand-alone film, Serenity is very enjoyable and itself deserves a high recommendation.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|Why make a kids game that you cant even get past the first level. don't you want people to beat your game and anticipate version 2? Stupid people in charge of writing this game. When you get a vehicle it gets faster and faster making it impossible to use it longer than 10 seconds. You will fail and lose your job if you haven't been fired already you will be so they can get a new game designer and programmer who will make this game fun and exciting and as popular as PVZ, a game worth playing and beating and making it's users cash cows when PVZ 2 came out! cant say the same for Jetpack something or other.........
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The only bad thing about NCIS is you get sucked in to the point where you start thinking you actually have relationships with these characters.  No matter how implausible, it's believable.  You care what happens to them.  It's like a soap opera for guys.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The genre of science fiction includes a lot of very ordinary writing which we wade through because we're mesmerized by the ideas, the novelty or -- admit it -- the spaceships.  When you run into a book that is truly well written -- think Stephenson, Stross, Banks -- it is such a wonderful experience.  \\"Wool\\" is that kind of experience.  The author actually knows how to paint with prose rather than just plod through a narrative, and for that alone I am grateful.<br /><br />Beyond that, this is a beautifully conceived and structured book (I read the Omnibus edition, so regard it as a single narrative).  The setting of the silo(s) is brilliantly conceived, and the author resists the temptation to explain it all for us up front, instead ladling out hints and pieces throughout the narrative.  The characters are complex, sometimes flawed, always interesting.  The plot is just plain riveting.  Action, suspense, surprises laid on top of a social structure whose complexity gives dimension to them.<br /><br />Just bought \\"Shift\\".  Can't wait.

I cannot think of any other book that would \\"work\\" so well, both with children and with adults.  It is a wonderful combination dramatic excitement and a sense of pure innocence.  You would have to be inhuman not to enjoy it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Not having heard of Firefly when it first aired, I just stumbled upon it here on amazon and with the mega-positive reviews, decided to give it a chance. I was not disappointed. All thirteen episodes are extremely well written. The characters are well developed. The special effects are pretty good for a television show. But what really kept me interested was the attraction of a space-western. It has all of the elements that we love. Heroes, villains, honor, duty, action, drinking, etc. just set in space. Clever concept. I was sorry that there were so few episodes. I would have gladly watched more. Better thirteen than none. Highly enjoyable tv and highly recommended.

140006922X|5.0|I came to this book having seen all of the coverage it got on the major networks. I have read few books on the subject of Jesus' life prior to this, but found it to be very rewarding.<br /><br />Aslan's argument, that Jesus was a \\"zealot,\\" meaning in essence that he was for an autonomous Jewish state as well as for purification of religious rituals, seems fairly reasonable based on the evidence, both from various historical events of the time and what can be gleaned from his life through biblical passages, as well as subsequent scholarly research which Aslan cites meticulously.<br /><br />For newcomers to the subject, Aslan's explanation of the historical context within which Jesus was born is crucial, and is often lost when reading the New Testament.<br /><br />Overall, a positive experience. Highly recommended to anyone with minor interest in the topic.
B0029LCJJS|1.0|Too much drama and talking talking talking but oh wait their going to war..... oh wait there is more talking and the king is desecrating other men's wives and getting caught and the husband doesn't do anything.. oh were they going to go to war and actually have a battle scene? well watch a few more sex and talking talking talking scenes while you wait for some fighting medieval sword action. Only to find out there will be more talking and drama and the French killing the king and just hear rumors about what the new sex addict king is going to do about it! We need a show about medieval wars and awesome battle scenes that will rival Lord of The Rings!

B0089LOG02|5.0|.....of hardships interwoven across generations, and told through parallel and disparate experiences of two orphans, seven generations apart.  One of the best books I've read this year!  The stories recognize the darkness of human experiences at its worst, and the impact that a kind gesture can have....like ripples on the surface of water.  The Author reports on the horrid conditions endured by one rider ( of the titled Orphan Train) in particular without descending into icky over-sentimentality.  An eye-opening read about one girl's journey told in two voices.  Read this!  It is engrossing and damages to be uplifting in spite of the toughness.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love the lighthearted feel of this book. It's interesting that I found this book online after becoming interested in the law of attraction and manifestation. All the exercises that I did worked (and they continue to)<br /><br />The yellow butterfly experiment particularly got my attention. I had dropped off my dog at the vet's for a tooth removal and as I was walking out the door I felt sad that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to him (the assistant took him from me without me realizing that he wasn't going to be back until after the procedure). A HUGE yellow butterfly came flying above me as I walked out of there! Then, that evening, I got a card from my boyfriend that had two butterflies on the front. Coincidence? Maybe. But the other experiments also worked.<br /><br />In the past, situations and events have occurred that I have had a certain &#34;knowing&#34; about and I've often wondered &#34;did I know that was going to happen, or did I make it happen by thinking about it'? After this book, I'm much more convinced that it's the latter and that my thoughts do in fact create my reality. Try it and see for yourself!

I don't feel I'm a worthy judge<br /><br />I found the ideas interesting, but the storytelling quite boring.<br /><br />None of the characters felt alive to me.<br /><br />More clinical and scientific exploration of science and religion as opposed to a great story.<br /><br />The use of Portuguese followed by the English text inflated the word count, but did nothing to progress the story or ignite the imagination.<br /><br />The overly worded explanations and retelling of  past events added to the tedium.<br /><br />In Ender's Game I shared the journey with Ender. I felt him. There wasn't a single character I could relate too in this book.<br /><br />Everyone did what was expected. No surprises.

0446572985|1.0|Warning:  Spoilers below<br /><br />I've liked most of Baldacci's other works, but this one was quite bad. Where to start...<br /><br />-- Robie supposedly assassinates an Arab terrorist in the beginning and we find out later that Robie's agency has an \\"inside man\\" planted in the terrorist's inner circle.<br /><br />-- For nearly the remainder of the book, it is assumed the terrorist was killed. Eventually, Robie and Robie's agency figures out the terrorist survived. In the end, the inside man helps arrange the capture of the terrorist.  Wait... if the inside man is still there... how did Robie's agency not know the man was still alive?  He obviously had contact with the agency, since the capture was arranged at the end.  This is a HUGE mistake.<br /><br />-- So... somehow the terrorist is able to pay off about a dozen well-paid government employees and find out Robie was the man who tried to kill him. Rather than simply kill Robie, the terrorist orchestrates a complex plot that puts him on a bus with a 14 year old girl named Julie and then has a man go after Julie, KNOWING that Robie will intervene and they both will get off the bus, and then the bus will blow up, and now Robie is linked up with the only lead that can ruin the terrorist's ultimate plan.  What?  The character of Julie was of no value and there was zero reasons for the bad guys to keep her alive.  None.  But, that's okay because...<br /><br />-- Later on, the terrorists jump through more hoops to blackmail a woman into saying she saw two African-Americans get off the bus, therefore \\"toying around\\" with Robie.  What?<br /><br />-- Secret Service agents and officers don't carry 9mm pistols.  A detail missed.<br /><br />-- The bad guys send \\"compromising\\" photos of Robie sleeping with a woman who ends up being an assassin.  Why are these photos compromising.  She fooled everyone.  They were two adults having sex. There are no grounds for blackmail here.  The entire photo exercise was pointless.<br /><br/>-- Robie's mysterious agency, as well as the FBI, and the White House were all compromised by the terrorist.  Forgetting for the moment that this is impossible, Robie sends Julie off with FBI Special Agent Vance to the Washington Field Office where she will be safe. Right.  Oh, and Robie continues to trust his boss, \\"The Blue Man\\" throughout the book when he has no reason to.  Awful.<br /><br />-- Robie is a highly trained operative. The best the country has to offer. However, throughout the book he is continuously followed, listened to, photographed, and his every move is anticipated. Even his escape route that NOBODY knows about is compromised from the beginning.<br /><br />These are just a few examples of the errors in this book.  I'm all for suspending disbelief, but this book was really, really bad. I'm shocked at all of the positive reviews. I hope Baldacci ditches this series soon and brings his novels back down to Earth.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|I like Zombie movies, especially this time of year with Halloween right around the corner.  I've loved Zombies since my first Zombie movie &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34;  when I was a kid growing up in Pittsburgh.  There's an unusual twist not usually seen in Zombie apocalypse films.  I've seen both versions, the rated and unrated.  I recommend the unrated version.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|Overall this appears to be a light-weight work to me - besides the 10K hour rule, and the cultural impact on success (including the PWI), I don't get much. It made you slightly less motivated to chase our dreams, since you are presented with all of the stories and analysis about the critical success factors that are out of your own control in a way. It is a good book to spark some thinking and conversation over dinner table. However I won't want to read it again because there is no need - you can finish it quickly and understand/remember perfectly the straightforward points the author wanted to convey. I would give it 3.5 starts if possible.

0385535147|3.0|The story is kind of weak by John Grisham standard. It had some good suspense, but the ending is too perfect. It was too smooth. IT wasn't his best work, but I did enjoy reading it.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Note: this review has Spoilers.<br /><br />I'll preface this by saying that I finished this book very quickly. It's enjoyable enough in that typical King way that I wanted to go back to these small town characters and find out what they were up to, what happened to them, and how they would feel about it. Unfortunately, by the end I felt that I was caring more for \\"ghostie people\\" (Abra's word for spirits) than actual characters; their author seemed to have abandoned them to a rushed, predictable, and too-neat ending.<br /><br />I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the beginning of the novel, which introduces us to Danny and his struggle with alcoholism. Danny is a dark, wounded character, weak in the grip of addiction at first, but with enough self loathing and empathy for others that we pity rather than hate him.  King is at his best when he has his characters struggle with their inner demons and weaknesses. That is what really great horror can do - externalize all those invisible evils like insanity, mortality, alcoholism, and remorse - make them into grinning, dripping ghouls that we brush up against, fight, and sometimes win out on. But in the BEST horror, winning out never comes without a terrible price.<br /><br />So where does Danny's struggle go? He goes to AA, gets straight, and that's it. Now he's all good guy. All of the things that Danny was drinking to forget or to dull seem magically to disappear. Sure, he has one semi-pathetic Dark Secret, a Dark Secret that honestly isn't Dark enough really to help us understand how tortured he feels. I mean, what he did was totally awful, don't get me wrong. But. . .it should have been worse. Nearly incomprehensible. And in the heat of the battle against the 'bad guys', the Dark Secret, as well as the terror he felt at his father's attack, should have come back and threatened to finish him off. All of his old guilt should have been used against him. He should have wound up drunk again, fallen off the old wagon. Something.<br /><br />There needed to be some Human Cost in this fight - never once, not once, did I feel that a character that I cared about was truly in any kind of danger. In the best King novels, people die (he used to especially like to pick off people's offspring - as in Cujo or Pet Semetary); people lose their minds. Otherwise, and I'm asking this seriously - what's the point? If we don't feel this is truly life or death (of course, we are \\"told\\" it, many times, but never did I *feel* it), why am I reading this? Real life actually IS life or death. It is horrible. People are dying, or losing loved ones, or going out of their minds, every minute. The reason we, or at least, I, read and watch horror is because it allows me to feel, examine and process the terror and pity and remorse that I simply can't feel in real life, because I wouldn't be able to bear it.<br /><br />Another reviewer called this a supernatural adventure story.  But I didn't feel the adventure, either. By the end, I knew pretty much exactly what was going to happen. Nothing was discovered or learned about the good guys or the bad guys; there was no twist whatsoever. And as a sequel to The Shining, which was one of the scariest stories of all time, we shouldn't have gotten a supernatural adventure. We should have gotten good old fashioned terror. What it seemed we got instead of either was King \\"protecting us\\" from anything too harsh. But we don't read horror to be protected; if we wanted a happy ending with no catch, we would have rented a rom-com. . .<br /><br />I won't even go into the problem with supporting characters that seemed too flat or added nothing, too many tangents, etc. If we'd had two strong main characters - Danny and Abra, who were struggling with serious demons and in danger of not making it out alive, I would have forgiven him the two-dimensional Billy, the wasted story line of Lucia, David and Concetta, etc.<br /><br />Ok, all that said - I feel like I'm being a little harshon King. Again - I finished, and mostly enjoyed, the book, because King has a great imagination and admirable skill in hooking you in to his world, even when you basically know what is going to happen is a great big Happy Ending.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|And frustrating at the same time given the state of our healthcare!! Good acting. Recommend this movie. It's not to long, just the right amount of time.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I cannot wait to order the next one,this order as always was prompt and efficient. Cannot wait to order the last season.
B00F35BV64|5.0|As a devotee of the original TV series I was worried that I wouldn't like them changing the original storyline. They have done a good job of tweaking the original story arc and making it very entertaining, while educating us on the young Captain Kirk.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Cute and funny movie.  Do not hesitate to purchase this movie.  Great for the whole family.  Saw it in 3D and now the HD version is also good
B00CATSONE|4.0|While I wanted this book to learn more about Nikola Tesla, I found myself intrigued with Sean Patrick's thoughts concerning imagination and geniuses.  By using Nikola Tesla as an example for Patrick's hypotheses, I not only fulfilled my desire for discovering more on Tesla, I also found a thoughtful and logical method of understanding the individuals we deem genius.  The book is short, but filled with a great deal of information and conceptions which are easily comprehended.  Read it and enjoy for it is a fantastic book.
B00CCCF4NW|4.0|(I originally gave this 3 stars; after another listen, it sounds better: 4 stars. Original review below)<br /><br />If your primary taste runs toward well-engineered recordings of powerful, deep bass beats strung out in endless, monotonous, unchanging, unchanging, unchanging... ummm, sorry, got caught up in the listening experience there, but anyway then you'll like this. There are moments of beauty here, however, which seem even more beautiful than they really are because they occur as vast moments of blessed relief just at the point when you're about to turn to something else and the veil of monotony finally lifts for long enough to let a breath of fresh air sweep in. Awesome, yeah. Hopkins has apparently worked with Brian Eno and some other significant and worthwhile artists, but probably should also put on his agenda a stint with Ryuichi Sakamoto or someone like that so he can learn to push the monotony out and let in more imagination--which he does seem to possess.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fun and intriguing read that quickly pulls you under to enjoy a new perspective and world mixing mystery and magic.
B008KE3960|2.0|This game was very boring. wa not a challenge at all.I already uninstalled it. Would not recommend it to anyone.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Great book. My third time reading it in 10yrs. Probably read it again in a few more years.  Clancy ROCKS!
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Without ruining anything, all I can say is that this was not the best movie ever made, but it is fun, fast-paced, and has an interesting twist.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Gritty and interesting show has a great bunch of actors involved. The story twists and turns remind me of 24 hours, which also kept my interest of the run of that series.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love shows that deal with the over imaginative concepts of life. My inner child really loves watching this show.
B00005RDRO|5.0|There's nothing to say. It's a classic spoof with the best actors of that time! My favorite: Peter Sellars is genius!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Good writing. Fast paced action. Good story line. If you like Star Trek in general, this film will be fun to watch.I really enjoyed it!!
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|There are not too many free sites.  This one is alright due to fact that it doesnt cost unless you want to upgrade.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It is fun to play the bad guy sometimes. This version of Birds is a little harder to manage as the navigation is hidden more.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|SEE THE ORIGINAL W/STALLONE (WHICH IS NOT THAT GOOD BUT BETTER THAN THIS!).  Although rotten tomatoes gives this one a higher rating, imho Stallone's version is better---better stars in it and better comic relief.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Its still a Brad Pitt zombie movie but the story was pretty good and it had some intense moments.  They did a good rendition of fast zombies.  Not thrilled with their \\"answer to infection\\", but it beat the hell out of another time sucking episode of the Walking Dead.  CG did not suck.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I was cautiously optimistic about the book, being such a Stephen King fan. My opinion is the story starts like a bike on training wheels; shaky, unsure if it's going to crash or take off. Luckily the story takes off.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book was very unique and kept the reader's interest. Seeing the world through the eyes of the child in this book was a very effective choice.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|It was a little cheesy but I did like the movie. Some interesting stars showing up<br />Stallone looks old, Swartz too
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I enjoyed reading Elizabeth Gilbert's writing as it felt like a diary, a book about marriage, and a history book. I learned a lot in this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who is going to marry! And finally, I fell in love with Felipe, the Brazilian. God bless you both - Greek and Hebrew.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Pretty good movie, which brings to the conclusion of the tesseract saga and ties into to Captain America and Thor.  However, I don't understand how Thor returned to Earth without the bifrost bridge to open the way?
B00F35BV64|5.0|I think this movie was a lot better than the first one. I enjoyed very much. I would like to see a third one
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it. It starts a little slow but it make up for it with good storyline and great action scenes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good game to play when you are waiting in the doctor's office or when bored. Brain exercises on the go.
1250010403|4.0|I enjoyed the book but was frustrated with the ending  not having realized that there were several more books to read.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I loved the movie it was very good; however the problem was with the quality of the image.  I paid for HD quality but got very poor standard image.  This is the second time this has gapped with Amazon On Demand.  I hope this is not becoming the norm.
B0055MBQOM|3.0|I was able to calibrate pretty easily the first time I used it, but I wanted to see if I could get it closer so I tried again. And again, and again... about 6 times more, to be exact. Each time take more than 5 minutes, and it kept telling me that it couldn't get a good reading. That ended up being a serious time suck. You do have to make sure the device is sitting perfectly flush and the counterweight should help with that, but that's really not too difficult. I'll try again when I have time to sit and focus on that, and I'm hoping it behaves this time. As far as manual calibration, it is much faster, easier, and gentler on the eyes that trying to fumble through the monitor's calibration program. The results were also vastly different!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I like science fiction and good visual effects. Very well presented and enjoyable. I loved how Jack defeated the giant with two head
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|DT has done it again. They have delvered another great album as good as anything that has  come before. I don't know if i could call this a classic but it wont let you down.
B00CP4GSGO|5.0|Just an awesome soundtrack and the Vinyl version just makes it so much better. Came in great condition and all the vinyls played without a problem
B0053YGYO4|3.0|Do you remember those earlier coldplay albums in which you'd have a really great hit or maybe 2 and then about 8 or so songs written by a five-year-old?<br /><br />Well, this album is the same thing except without the hits. Just a bunch of filler tunes.
B005HSL626|5.0|we love this app. My whole family loves to play it. (Amazon wants more words but I don't have anything further to say)
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This one was an instant hit with our kids. The story, the music, the animation... just incredible. I ended up grabbing this during one of those amazing flash sales, so I saved a bunch and still got the Prime shipping. This has both Blu-Ray and standard, so we can take on in the car with us to keep the kids happy. Unlike some of the other movies they've produced in recent years, this one is relevant and timeless, and a great movie for mothers and daughters to watch together. The song \\"Learn Me Right\\" was actually written by Mumford and Sons for the movie (listed on their own album as \\"Not With Haste\\" and both versions are so beautiful. This movie is a sure winner!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is a movie that keeps you entertained from beginning to end. I did not expect the end to be as it was. I love this movie very much.
1600243916|4.0|Apart from the epilogue, this book kept my complete attention and interest throughout. I find Gladwell's thesis refreshing, plausible, and less humanistic than most of his contemporaries. His thesis is that success is usually a product of more than self invention. Rather it is a combination of incredible opportunity, heritage, culture, and luck. Where you are from, says Gladwell, really matters.<br /><br />His method for the first half of the book is to walk through cases of extreme success. He examines the success stories of Canadian hockey players, the Beatles,  Bill Joy, and Bill Gates. He also examines questions about why Asians are good at math, why pilots from certain cultures crash a lot, and how the 'culture of honor' lingers for generations.<br /><br />Perhaps the most constructive point of the book for my personal development was the 10,000 hour principle. He suggests it takes about 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. Though I'm not sure if this is discouraging or motivating.<br /><br />Another strength of this book is that it constructively critical to the humanistic psyche of the American spirit, a criticism I welcome. Hard work is essential and is usually rewarded, but you do not control your own future. The sky is not the limit. You cannot be anyone you want to be. You have to be hardworking AND lucky. What Malcolm attributes to luck, I would call providence. As I read this book, I read it through the lens of my Christian worldview and am reminded that God makes men what they are. \\"Every good and perfect gift is from above...\\"<br /><br />While interesting, I can see how many won't take this work very seriously. His interaction with data seems to be loose. Claiming correlation is one thing... claiming causation is quite another. Sure there may be a correlation between rice farming and persistence on math problems, but how strong of a correlation is it? Oddly enough it the book seems to suggest that we consider alternative reasons for what leads to success.<br /><br />So what's the takeaway? I'm not too sure. Success isn't a formula. Work hard and hope you get lucky? Maybe. I know one thing's for sure, my daughter may be doing some math exercises next summer.ds to success.<br /><br />So what's the takeaway? I'm not too sure. Success isn't a formula. Work hard and hope you get lucky? Maybe. I know one thing's for sure, my daughter may be doing some math exercises next summer.
B009R54MGW|5.0|A really engrossing read which shows how fear and power may turn people into monsters. I don't agree with the view that the Irish would have cared about any of the feuding British royals.  If they supported any of them it would have been for profit or just for the hell of it!
B0099114WO|2.0|Purchased this movie based on all the hype and it was a big disappointment. Can't believe that these tow stars who have been in such great classic movies, allowed themselves to be talked into this one. Definitely a waste of money and don't even think I would watch it if it was broadcasted on regular TV
B00846REIS|2.0|I did not like this book. It was too similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. I wonder had I read this one first if I would have liked it? I put this down after only a few chapters. Could not finish.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It keeps you guessing and is wonderfully disturbing.  The only negative is that there is really no light moments so it's hard to watch more than a couple episodes without having to watch something lighter like Modern Family.  :)
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I like the movie because I am a fun of the rock. However I did not like the guy to die. I thought the white ninja was dead because what happened to him in the first part. I think they could have done better.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|I've been a hardcore \\"Dexter\\" fan since day one and agree with everyone that after season 4 it was almost all down hill from there. I was hoping an praying that with season 8 they would make something fantastic and send Dexter out with a bang.....boy were my hopes shot down, bang bang bang. I don't know how they managed to ruin one of the best shows on tv but they did and they sure put the nail in the \\"Dexter\\" coffin with the finale. I thought the \\"Weeds\\" series finale was bad but Dexter's finale takes the cake by far. It irritates the hell out of me, it makes me angry......if I could take it all back I would stop at season 4 and pretend the next 4 season never happened. I won't reveal any spoilers for those that haven't watched but the ones who have watched know. So that's it I'm done, I can't write anymore about this, so long \\"Dexter\\" thanks for the many hours of enjoyment and a series finale full of painful memories.
B005LAII44|5.0|The movie was ok, not as good as the 1st, but it was ok. Movies r not the same anymore
B001LMAK88|5.0|Love this movie. I have seen this movie many, many times and never grow tired of it.  While the movie was released when many of the characters had yet to become famous( Kevin Costner, Danny Glover, Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn) , it now has become one of my favorite movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a good book. I loved it. Definitely one of my faves. Have recommended to others and they loved it as well.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AMAZIIINNNGGGG! IT LITERALLY TOOK ME ONE DAY TO FINISH!THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!NOT LIKE YOUR TYPICAL CORNY \\"CONTEMPORARY\\" BOOKS.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing. This story was so intriguing, so emotionally intense. Strange that I grew to like the narrator so much, knowing who he is and all. Everything from the point of view to the characters and the way the story was told made this novel unique. The characters felt so real to me. Their story is deep, tender and painful. I laughed, I cried. Stories with some historical truth like this one--especially those set in the Holocaust era and the like--always make me cry. So unjust. So sad. This is a story I will remember.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Yesterday I awoke to find Doctor Sleep loaded into my kindle.  The urge to skip work was great after reading just the first few lines. But off to  work I went.  Tried I left the book alone last night but this morning I dove in. Not much work has been done at work today but I've had the best read I've had intra
B007VUA7VO|3.0|It works, but I just thought it would work in the back ground and it doesn't.  I just open it when I need it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I can't wait to read more of this author! I loved nearly every word! I will be reading more and more!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I did not think this movie was very well done at all. Especially considering all the hype. I do not recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for the next season. Was so shocked by the end. Can't wait to see what happens. Don't want to give anything away
B001DTTG16|5.0|My delight in this film is immense as dance here is a lovely offering of ballet to hip hop all set in a sweet story set for me into enjoyable backdrops of urban verismo..
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it and can't wait for the next book to come out! I need more Mrs.cross please hurry up and don't keep me waiting
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good science fiction read looking forward to the next book in the series, exciting approach on wasteland post apocalyptic world.
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|I've read plenty of military books, none of which capture a fight for survival quite like this one. Slow start but great fast paced sequence right through the middle.
B0018BB20W|5.0|Great instrumental/rock tunes when jogging through the lake trails at the park.  I never knew this kind of music existed.
B0045OHUNM|5.0|I like all 3 albums about equally (Visions, Halfaxa, Geidi Prime) even though Visions is the one I was introduced to first. Some parts of Halfaxa sound distraught, some parts ethereal, others ghastly. I still need to give it a few listens over to cement the songs in my head, but I can tell I won't be disappointed.
0744014956|5.0|I absolutely love this guide.  It is nothing special as far as guides go, but nothing beats having a hardcover guide with some bonus art.  I thoroughly enjoy it, and will use it plenty in the coming months.<br /><br />Shipping, however, was a nightmare.  First, the product was delayed past two day shipping, and then, when I finally received the package, pages were warped (from what may be water damage) and corners of the guide were knocked in a little.  It is nit-picking, but if its your job to deliver packages on time and in retail condition, then getting a hardcover book wet and bruised is a failure.<br /><br />I contact customer service again (I already have for the late shipping) and attempt to replace the guide, but I'm just content with finally having it.<br /><br />I will note that this isn't the first time I've bought a book and received it with wet/warped pages.  Its making me think twice about buying books here on Amazon.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Before purchasing this book, read the expose in Esquire.  I hope that Dr. Alexander experienced everything described in his book, but he's not the right person to tell this story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is such an amazing book. It is probably my favorite book. I will probably read this book over and over again.
B001F6ZIXW|3.0|The show is great but amazon instant streaming really sucks. Only works when it wants. Gets stuck on &#34;buffering&#34;. I ended up just ordering the DVDs.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to work out the logical portion of their brain. It's fun but more importantly it makes you think critically. A great game, I'm hooked!!
0060872675|5.0|As soon as I found out about this book, I ordered it, as it is by my favorite author. My 2 1/2 year old has not read any other of Pratchett's works, but found this book amusing nonetheless. Quite a nice book, I would recommend it, heartily.
1401201911|4.0|This trade collects the entire Superman: Red Son story (#1-3).<br /><br />I never been a huge fan of Superman stories in general, but when the core character is properly explored or challenged great things can happen. Loeb's For All Seasons examines the difficulties the Superman we know would face as an outsider, and is told by key people throughout his life.  Busiek's Secret Identity is an outside the box look at a \\"normal\\" Clark Kent who has faced a life of teasing for having the same name as the comic book hero, and is in for quite the shock when he develops powers himself. Both are amazing, and most importantly, built on strong characters and emotional challenges.<br /><br />I'd heard a lot of good things about Red Son, and the concept of turning the iconic American hero into an ideological opposite is brilliant, so I decided to give Millar's twist a try. Whatever I expected, this most certainly wasn't it. But it's definitely still a great multi-layered story with a lot of the same intangibles I mentioned above.<br /><br />The premise is simple - the rocketship carrying the alien infant that will become the most powerful being on the planet crashes not in Kansas, but in the Soviet Union. The story opens with a dramatic power shift in the cold war as a Soviet reveal a weapon \\"more effective than the hydrogen bomb.\\" Superman has been raised on the ideals of Stalin and socialism, and is here to protect them.<br /><br />Millar shies away from a lot of the directions I might have guessed this story would take.  Or rather it blends them into something distinct and engaging.<br /><br />Red Son does not go for the full bore \\"reality\\" of the previous stories I mentioned. It revels in it's over the top superhero roots and has moments of impossibly high stakes and bigger than life figures. But it's still firmly rooted in historical touches and a very even handed look at differing ideologies.  That latter is one of the book's greatest strengths. Lex Luthor is not suddenly anice guy because he represents the United States efforts to counter Superman and this Superman is not evil simply because he believes in Socialism. There is a nice variety of points of view and motivations in this story and the conflicts created and the way the characters react create deep and meaningful moments and themes.<br /><br />Another nice combination Millar chooses is the degree in which the rest of the world he's created differs from what we know. Generally alternate history tales start by changing one thing and see how everything else is affected without changing them otherwise, or they reform everything around a central concept and recasts all events and characters of importance into roles relevant to the new tale. Here we have careful selections of both. Lex Luthor and Lois Lane are presented largely as we remember them, just displaced in time and without Clark Kent's influence on their lives. Some other key characters are reimagined in the same way as Superman, with new origins that feel true to the characters we know but tie directly to Millar's tale and or the Soviet setting. It's a great approach that allows the flexibility to make everything fit the story being told and resonate on several levels.<br /><br />Millar ties this story in knots in wonderful ways. The imaginative twists and reveals cover all three issues and continue to the very last page. There were a lot more surprises than I expected going in, which I enjoyed.  They still fit logically and the lengths to which Millar is willing to spin things out in unexpected directions really worked here.  More issues would have been nice to develop certain things more, but there's a ton of story jammed in without rushing much.<br /><br />The art is very slick and matches the larger than life feel to the story. The facial shapes won't appeal to everyone but I thought they were good enough and the art in general solid. A single penciller for all three issues would have been better but their work isclose enough some won't even notice the switch.<br /><br />Red Son is almost certainly not what you'll imagine when you here the concept of a Soviet Superman, and that's a lot of the appeal of Millar's tale. It's different, well executed and quite compelling.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|action, drama, and comedy all rolled into one, great movie, I could watch it again and again. Can't wait for the new one
B006LSZECO|3.0|Husband says it was &#34;ok&#34;, but by that he usually means it was good, not excellent.  I have yet to read it myself.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I really like everything about this mouse.<br /><br />- It fits in my hand very well<br />- The custom profiles are great for multiple people or different games<br />- Mapping keys to buttons allows me to use my left hand solely for movement in WASD games, which is awesome.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say, and it's extremely minor, is that even with all the weights added I personally find it light.  I wouldn't mind a little more weight, but again, that's just me.  I like my mice to have the density of iridium.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was very good.  The author had quite a few small stories within the story.  The stories intertwined and made the overall book good.
030789701X|5.0|This book is fantastic to the fans of Elder Scrolls V. All necessary information are collected, and many beautiful figures are kept as guidance as well.  The quality of the paper is nice, smooth and green. I have not read through the book yet, but the first view of it is quite satisfied to me. I will post more review information when I finish reading.
1401227821|5.0|amazing art work from Adam Hughes, and he shows some sketches and humorous thought process about each one.  for DC fans is a must have.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|First off, if you were expecting Carcass to make Reek of Putrefaction or Symphonies of Sickness- you'll be disappointed.<br />Yes, there's even a part of me that wishes for at least one track in that vain, but we can't get everything we want, can we?<br /><br />Having said that, Surgical Steel could possibly be the best thing I've heard in 2013. That is, because I was one of those people that didn't cringe post Necroticism. I accepted each evolution this band has made with each record. And while I like some releases more than others- (I didn't like most of Swansong, although even that release had a few cool moments) the strength of Surgical Steel is at has all of what's cool about each Carcass release without  plagiarizing themselves.<br />It's not a 'walk down memory' lane record- it's relevant- especially with the gore/grind that's basically followed post Carcass' inception. Take for example a track \\"Noncompliance...\\" which seemingly is another throwaway track hearkening back to Necroticism's geeky medical dictionary inspired subject matter- only to have it be poking fun of all that's arrived in the wake of what Carcass' was doing. There's lots of moments where Jeff Walker's lyricism seems to be taking the **** out of the genre of death metal all the while- playing some pretty visceral but melodic death metal...<br />Bill Steer who in my opinion is one of the most under-rated frets-men in metal in general- really has out done himself on Surgical Steel. One could say on Swansong- his riffing and lead playing was turning more towards 'rock n roll'- but on here- he's just shredding- grinding and all the while making it look very easy. As a guitarist, let me tell you, it's not...<br />Sadly, the only the thing that makes me sorta bummed when listening to this album from beginning to end is the absence of Ken Owen's distinctive drumming style. No disrespect to Dan Wilding - who did an absolutely amazing job- but there's just no replacing Ken- and perhaps the band knewthis going in. The spirit of Ken is definitely here- who does actually make some<br />backing vocal appearances along with Bill Steer. (Welcome back to the vocals Bill!)<br />Some might cry foul that Mike Amott isn't present on here as well- but as much as I would have liked him to be included- he really was only on two studio albums. Oh well.<br />Most of the record borders between pretty damn good to absolutely amazing. I have to admit that a couple like \\"Mount of Execution\\" I'm still taking in. But there's so many highlights that it's hard to name them all when they happen. Direction-wise if I had narrow down what I thought this album was- it's kinda the missing link between Necroticism and Heart Work. Definetly good company. It might not be my favorite Carcass album- but it's still damn good.<br />Highlight tracks: \\"Thrasher's Abattoir\\", \\"Unfit for human consumption\\", \\"Captive Bolt Pistol\\"...

B0093H8HXS|5.0|I haven't stress tested this CPU, but it has done everything I asked of it quickly and efficiently.  Even with the stock heat sink, fan, and thermal paste it remains cool and manageable.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Closer to the truth, Cher's 26th studio album is a great one!  From the beginning track, all the way to the end, it soars.  All the songs are great, especially \\"Favorite Scars,\\" 'I Hope you find it,\\"  and \\"Dressed to kill.\\"  But especially the ballad, \\"Sirens\\" based on the events of 9/11.  I have never heard Cher sound better!  If you are a Cher fan or just a fan of good, fun music, purchase this album!
B005CTME76|4.0|Great shoe, but not as good as the trail glove for my needs. It is extremely lightweight, fairly flexible and has great traction on the trails.  The forefoot also has a thicker sole than the road glove which help to protect against roots and rocks bruising the soles of my feet.  It's upper is not very flexible compared to the trail glove though although it is warm and waterproof. It has the exact same sole as the trail glove though.  This runs big so order a half size smaller than your normal shoe size.  The only significant downside to this shoe is that it has terrible traction on hard wet surfaces.  If you are ok with the tradeoff of flexibility and for waterproof and warmth it is a great shoe.  It's still far more flexible than the vast majority of other trail shoes though but just not quite the barefoot feel I'm looking for.  Returned and kept the trail glove.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Unlike so many movies coming out of Hollywood these days this one delivers.  We have a story that follows Joseph Campbell’s ‘Hero’s Journey’ which makes the storyline enjoyable.  They took their time to build up the story line and get us to care about characters in it.  We get to see Captain America in a modern city alone with Stark whom I think is the child of the girl Captain America liked in his first movie.  No, I haven’t read the comics.  We get to see Thor come back, yet it’s not explained how with the rainbow bridge destroyed.  The Hulk returns with a new guy playing him.  I like the other guy better from the last Hulk movie.  He played a David Banner closer to the TV series than anyone else as of yet.  Yet, the new guy will do.  We also get introduced to other new characters whose storyline was considered too ‘lame’ to be put into a movie.  Which is why we're missing ‘Ant-man’ and ‘Wasp’ movies.  There wasn’t even a mention of them anywhere.  This is a great movie if you want action, storyline, and depth meaning.  It draws on all the previous movies and paves the way for future ones.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|A simple story of grit of one individual who goes about this his life in his own determined way. I loved it.
8866135887|5.0|I really like this planner because it has plenty of room for each day of the week. I feel like I can write everything down, even little things.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is full of surprises that keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat wondering what.'s around the corner. I take my kindle everywhere with me now so any spare moments I have I can return to where I leleft off.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I watched this after reading the books. I enjoyed the story the books told, but felt that the writing left much to be desired. It isn't just the genre - I have read intelligently written YA lit - but this is not that. So this is a movie based on a poorly written story with a rather annoying voice, but about an interesting idea/concept and one that bears looking into in both book and movie form.<br /><br />I felt the movie was particularly lacking in its portrayal of the Capitol's citizens. It felt like the people who made the movie were almost afraid to portray them seriously as they were in the book because it might've been too much like Hollywood (on LSD...)? I'm not sure. But there was rich material to work with [in the book], and it was a missed opportunity.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I loved all the history on the adoption train, I have researched it and this brings to light the information I have read.  I also liked the story about a girl in currently in foster care.  I enjoyed the book and read it in two sitting.  Couldn't put it down.  Will look for other stories by this author.  Usually do not read these types of stories.
B00DCRE83S|2.0|You know what this album is good for? -When I'm rocking out in the garage working with the motor, and I can't hear a damn thing, including this album.<br /><br />For an ex-member of METALLICA, I expected more. The lyrics are meh !!!AT BEST!!!, and the lead vocals are about more than I can handle after any two songs... The style reminds me of 80's metal like Megadeth, which is not what I anticipated or desired. I suppose I just wasn't on the same page. After the first listen and a half, I generously rated this 2*. Nocturnus has the most appeal to me. We'll see if this grows with additional listenings, whenever that may be, but for now, I wouldn't call these guys the Kings of the Underdogs, but I have faith in Jason Newsted and his crew to produce something with much greater presence.<br /><br />In sum, give it a go or sample if you're into 80's/Megadeth sound, but it's not for me. Perhaps I'll visit back on the next release to see what surfaces.<br /><br />14JAN14 update: it remains 2/5* at best. -Who is rating this album 4/, or 5/ of 5*? -His crew?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Damn book made me cry. If nothing else, it was worth the read to make you appreciate your life, health and loved ones.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love the game but when you play for many weeks and build your coins up it never ever seems to go down.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The cast has great chemistry and I enjoyed the quirkiness included in the dialogue.  Spock was great fighting against Khan.  I was not disappointed. I recommended it to my Dad and he purchased the DVD and enjoyed as well as my Mom.  I hope there is another one coming.
B00A77II0U|5.0|One of the first games I bought on my kindle and one of my favorites still I enjoy the fact that it is a hide and find with a great story line and it has alot of activites in it to do.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great flow!  Corruption, politics and love, career and family, the Good Wife has it all.  Lawyers struggling between money to stay within the law is what attracted me the most.  It's not violent, the action not that predictable, you get into it and it's entertaining and relaxing after a stressful day.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I am a syfy buff and liked the first Dredd movie with Stallone.  The movie is worth watching time and time again.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|I am not such a huge fan of Selena Gomez but I do enjoy her music. Her new CD surprised me in a good way. It had a mixture of different song types. Her emotions were well expressed. Multiple of the songs boost your mood and I think Selena has grown to discover other types of music her voice works well with. Good job Selena!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Cute. Awesome. Heart warming. Funny! Love watching this with my nephew! Keeps us both entertained. Had us laughing a lot. Great story.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  I knew the movie would be completely different, but I couldn't complain about that without reading the book first.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I got this book.  It's a great way to tell this story.  I really like the many different stories of how people survived the zombie war.

B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Addictive doesn't even start to describe this game or the hilarity it has. Funny quotes and mayhem await. Great purchase to kill time.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Good storyline which kept my attention. Great variety of puzzles which were fun to solve with one exception -- sometimes the puzzles fail to recognize a correct response and you feel as though you're out of options and require Help. Then it turns out that Help tells you to do exactly what you just did! Were it not for that, I would give this app a solid 5 *****
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|Super amazingly awesome one of the coolest games I have played so far. It's the bees knees I swear yo.
B00284BNKC|5.0|I'm a big movie buff but somehow this movie slipped through the cracks for me. I just recently saw it for the first time and bought it shortly after. I really love this movie. Great performance from Ellen Burstyn and a great story. Recommended for sure!
B005LAIIHG|1.0|My mom bought me this movie and I sat threw and watched the whole thing. I was so bored to tears and plus it was too sad. I was crying  the next day and My mom asked me the next day if I had to go live in a stress center and I said \\"no\\". Sorry Folks! but I'm thinking of giving my copy away or selling it. I don't know. I do love animal flicks though. In my opinion, this movie was like an Asian version of \\"Secondhand Lions\\" (Which is a movie I did love). If you enjoyed \\"Secondhand Lions\\", and \\"Wild America\\" alot better (Like Me), Then stick with those movies. Thanks for reading. Peter Smith
B00F91RYL8|4.0|BY the title I mean that this movie starts off with a bang.  There's no wading through an hour of character build-ups you just get right down to business, which is great because we're not watching this for character back story we just want to see the end of the world.  So the movie gets started fast, keeps you going on a thrill ride fairly well without any lags in activity. Pitt does a good job with his character.  Overall a decent zombie movie with big budget effects, nothing particularly new to the genre, but not bad overall.  I would say I'm glad I rented this instead of paying big bucks in a theater, as a rental it makes for an entertaining evening at the right price.  Is it like the book, no, only loosely.  It goes with the typical Hollywood Action/thriller script, one fairly average guy just wanting to protect his family thrown into overwhelming circumstances and only HE can save the world in the end, thank god.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  It's a zombie movie, but it's not all that gory if you're really not into zombie movies normally. It's definitely better than a grade B flick, has a good budget for effects is overall entertaining and Brad Pitt as the hero.  For the price of a rental it's definitely worth it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|... Ow. My feels.<br /><br />Thats all i have to say. That, and don't read this book in class like me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does what it's supposed to. I keep it in my favorites. When I need to figure anything out,it's right there. On my KFHD the buttons are nice and big, you can see all your entries and review them to be sure they were entered correctly. It's a keeper, with a great price. I don't even notice the ads....does it have any?  ;)
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is amazing a love it you can take pics and videos how I said before amaziiiiiiing love it
B004ZH66XO|4.0|UPDATE 11/14/2013: This review is still relevant. They still have not added in app purchases or adds. The reviews complaining about the bait-and-switch are no longer relevant. This company's integrity has apparently begun to Grow.<br /><br />You can no longer spend extra money on the game after buying the game so that means you now get the whole game right away. There are no actual ads in game anymore either. This really helps to create a more immersive game.<br /><br />That being said, we can now talk about the actual game. The game has cute graphics that may slow your device down a bit with lag. The sounds are peaceful.  The game play extremely simple but fun. I've only really run into one unforgivable problem: the very last stage in the very last world force closes the game on me every time.  Every time.<br /><br />Still a pretty fun game and well worth the download.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|Boring, boring, and did I ever mention boring. I rented this on demand one friday night and I thought it was just a sucky movie. What else can I say? It was just flat out boring. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL BE DISSAPPOINTED. Peter Smith
B000T433CO|5.0|Good movie to put you in a good mood. Light hearted. Great actors. Cute storyline. Definite must in our movie library
B007L6VR12|4.0|Excellent movie that you will find yourself completely immersed in. Acting is superb especially by the young leads. Fraught with humor and unexpected quirks, Moonrise Kingdom will leave you with a smile.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Very well done, good action, good tech for a TV show, keeps the viewer engaged, like how it weaves in the movie facts.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The characters are excellent, the story interesting and engaging.  I really enjoyed this series and continued to watch all four years.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|Katy Perry is a new talent to me, and I knew very little about Katy Perry before I watched this program.  I knew she had pink or blue hair, but I learned that is only a very small fraction of the person Katy really is.  Katy impressed me with her talent, devotion to her fans and to the people who have helped on her journey, and the love she has for her family.  All of her family may not appreciate what she is doing, but she respects their opinion.  I wanted to cry when the film documented her sadness when her marriage dissolved.  That segment was so sad, but she was so courageous to perform for her fans instead of wallowing in self pity.  Katy Perry has a new 'older' fan.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|REVIEWS<br /><br />Having watched the movie was the strongest reason why I didn't feel the need to read the book. It always bumped in my mental vault, the fact that someone had come up with such a powerful and compelling idea, executed it impecably on screen (Norton's and Pit's acting was phenomenal; perhaps Pit's finest performances). I finally gave the book a try. I was surprised to see that the book was short. It didn't put me off at all, it was just an observation, especially after having watched the movie I expected a lengthier book.<br /><br />As I read through the pages I was aware of the nuances with the movie, something that made my neurons glitch from time to time, for I expected one thing, yet found something else. Yet, Palahniuk's mastery of his unique style and narrative kept me reading and reading, constantly trying to decipher why the writing style was so good and so bold and so... damn original.<br /><br />The story itself is strong, consistent to the bone and detail oriented without being overwhelming. I figured Fight Club was very successful because it defined a putrid, rotten world that exists within the human realm. Fight Club gave this world a face, a personality, a tangible morphology we could finally grasp. This world occupies the mind of the bluest, the raw material of hatred towards the organized, paved by those who seek to control through the creation of rules that determine a beings reality. This reality has a big blind-spot, and the world Palanhniuk described in Fight Club defined this blind-spot and exploited it. This blind-spot is an individual's need to feel unique, and yet, the opposing desire to feel he is part of a movement, a group, to be part of a collective. To be part of Fight Club one had to slay one's reality, to lay naked midst the ugly and emerged reborn, only to join a new set of dogmas. This is portrayed as the idea of propagating organized-chaos, an idea that spread through the mediocre like a virus. The virus lived among society cloaked under the veil of working men, men who seemed to follow a set of social rules; the virus unveiled during the night, during Fight Club. An integrant of Fight Club was a menacing soul in search of freedom, from social expectations and the boxed-in sensation felt by binding rules of how one must supposedly behave midst peers. The soul within Fight Club sought freedom, even from itself, only to be lured by its desire to belong, to be part of the clan: the paradox of wanting to be unique and yet, the inevitability of desiring to be part of cult, to be part of the change. Man's demise is served cold in Fight Club, for example, when Tyler makes soap out of fat rendered by liposuction--society's shame--, sold back to the thinned as soap, purchasing what once was thought as biological waste, now regarded precious and a standard of &#34;high society&#34;.<br /><br />To leave aside the story, I would like to mention Palahniuk's writing style. To achieve the deliverance of a message so profound, in such a raw manner, using short sentences and explicit imagery is indeed a literary achievement. I truly enjoyed this read, far better than watching the movie. The movie, however, is also an achievement in itself.society cloaked under the veil of working men, men who seemed to follow a set of social rules; the virus unveiled during the night, during Fight Club.

B00DWHWOFC|5.0|I love all of the Graphilogic puzzles. I have quite a few of them on  my phone and was happy to see I could get some of them on my Kindle Fire. Since the screen is bigger it is easier to solve the larger puzzles.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|As far as scary movies go that have you on the edge of your seat and make you jump, I'd put this up there with some of the classics. My girlfriend was peering through her fingers and genuinely screamed a few times. The directing is good and the camera work matches up well with an eerie soundtrack.<br /><br />I feel the last 10 minutes could have been done a bit better, but overall I'm looking forward to seeing Insidious 2 now.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show and all the visual appeal.  The settings, scenery, costumes, and details of that era make it a show I can watch multiple times getting something I'd missed the time before.  The characters acting make it a believable show that seems to be catching on everywhere I go...people love it!  Me too!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|it not tell complet story why space want wipe human and who make it titen ? to watch it cool not bad sci factoin
B00CSV7AFC|5.0|I love every song on this album. Definitely in my top favorite bands! My favorite songs on it are &#34;Need it&#34;, &#34;Nerve&#34; and &#34;Call me in the afternoon&#34;. :)
0765334798|5.0|I bought this book because it won the 2013 Hugo Award for the Best Science Fiction Novel AND because it vaguely related to Star Trek. I read it in two sittings. By about page 100, I couldn't put it down. The book is a quick read and very funny and entertaining (especially for Trek fans.) But it has several unexpected plot twists and is very moving, especially at the end. I absolutely loved it. Highly recommend - one of the best of the genre.
B009CG25JM|5.0|I loved it because of that movie we own a 1932 Ford the movie is a classic that's for sure
0500542872|4.0|(So, this is me coming up to speed on Stephen Shore.)<br /><br />At first I didn't get it. Page after page of what seemed snapshots except for the high level of detail. I was ready to dismiss it as a mystery-- \\"The Case of the Missing Point\\", to be precise.<br /><br />HOWEVER, some of the shots brought me to a stop-- evocative far beyond the apparent ordinariness of the image. This made me suspect that I had missed something in the images I had dismissed. I didn't learn until the interview at the end of the book what he had been trying to do, or that he was using a view camera to do it. All these shots were 'deliberately trying to look casual', but were also very deliberately composed, with some kind of hook, usually in the detail.  Aha. My second time through the book was much more enjoyable.<br /><br />So if you are studying photography, this book is like a textbook in at least one way: It has some of the answers in the back-- Read the interview first.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I purposefully avoid short stories because I prefer a deeper and more involved treatment of topic and character.  The only author whose shorts I've liked is Philip K. Dick.  But then I read a wonderful, free little short by Brian Sanderson, Firstborn.  That gave me the incentive to read The Emperor's Soul.  I'm glad I did, because I enjoyed this work on several levels.<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul is pretty much a work of art.  It's a novella -- a slightly beefier short story -- that reads like a full length novel.  The characters and the environment in which they interact are wholly genuine and have meaningful depth.  The novella format offers very little time to present the main characters.  Yet each feels whole nonetheless, as those facets we do see are so believable and so perfectly essential to the story itself.<br /><br />The story is surprisingly complex for its length, with various related threads of ethical issues, political maneuvering, widely disparate character motivations, and engaging (and in some cases subtly profound) character interactions.  A unique system of magic, coupled with the initial event that kicks off the story, exposes an interesting treatment of the nature of the human soul.  The story also compares and contrasts the concepts of artisan and craftsman (art vs construction).<br /><br />I'm frankly a bit in awe over the level of talent Mr. Sanderson puts on display.  So much content so well integrated in just under 200 pages.  I have heard that The Emperor's Soul recently won a Hugo award, which is not surprising.  I've only found Sanderson's works, and look forward to reading more.
B004VWH3KI|4.0|Very different yet interesting style, one that I had not come across before. The whole book is basically a bunch of short stories, each one with different characters. Only a few of them reappear in additional stories/chapters, or at least mentioned again.<br /><br />It's also very obvious that this book was written in the '50s. The lifestyles, the racism, the threat of nuclear war. Not that's a bad thing; I always enjoy seeing how past generations had envisioned their future/our present. It makes me wonder if, 50 years from now, the science fiction we write today will come across as...cheesy? Archaic?
B00DQR26EC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I am already playing through it a second time! Someone should take my kindle away from me...
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I found my new favorite christmas movie<br /><br />Its so cute and I was just so filled with emotions, I know it sounds sappy but buy this movie its great
B008133MDK|5.0|I love the way how the show combine modern science and technology with Sherlock's wit. Cant wait for the third season!!
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|This movie was beautiful - the clothing, the locations. But there was no depth. This could have been ten times more interesting but for most of the well-trained actors there was no character development, the movie flip flopped around the plot a lot which was confusing, and I honestly was bored for most of the movie.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|I love this stuff. Too fun. Easier to clean up than I imagined. My son loves it and I am pretty sure I love it even more because it is kind of mesmerizing.
B00BB8T9FC|4.0|This is a good story with great acting. The love story reminds me of pearl harbor a little bit. I would recommend this movie to everyone
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Not as good as his previous books.  Beautifully written but with too many narrators all speaking in the first person making it difficult to know whose story you are reading.
B00CM4VC7M|3.0|The box was damaged upon arrival just like the posts before this one. I was really disappointed with that since I didnt want the box to be opened for collector purposes but yeah. Ill remember to ask them forvbubble wrap or just look else where
B004EF65QA|5.0|Based on a novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, this tells an initially sad story of a family, the Hales, moving to a bleak northern UK town. The local cotton mill pollutes the air, reinforcing the dark atmosphere of workers laboring for long hours in exchange for low wages. There's no warmth or fun on the horizon, as the climate is colder than in the south.  So, there are no beautiful flowers or pastoral views.  There's a lack of educated society, so Miss Hale takes tea with the mill owner's sister, while her father offers educational sessions to the mill owner whose father died when he was quite young.  Miss Hale is outspoken in front of John Thornton, the mill owner, because her father was a clergyman who has raised her with a strong sense of right and wrong.  Miss Hale dislikes Thornton in the beginning, but begins to notice that John is a fair boss who tries to makes good decisions for his workers.  There's also a labor leader who plans a strike for better conditions, whose daughter becomes one of Miss Hale's best friends.  Sadly, the strike talk leads to violence. When Miss Hale bravely stops the violence, she gets injured in the head by a brick, so John feels obligated to offer her his hand in marriage.  She turns him down, because her mother has just died and she doesn't want to leave her father alone.  She also can't let Thornton in on a family secret, that her brother is hiding from the law, since Thornton is a magistrate for the courts.  Sadly, Thornton sees her hug her brother goodbye, deciding incorrectly that she is behaving shockingly with a lover.  As time goes by, Miss Hale's best friend dies, as well as her father.  While steeped in grief, she finally inherits a house, plus some money.  She decides to offer John capital to re-start his mill, so he can re-hire all the starving workers.  John finally finds out that the man Miss Hale was hugging late at night was actually her brother.  The gentle climax to this love story is that Thornton takes a train down toher old southern town, hoping to re-connect with her.  She, going north to help re-open the mill, ends up at the same train station.  She first offers him money as a business proposition; he offers her a flower from her home town while opening his heart to propose to her again.  What follows is one of the most poignant scenes in the history of love stories.  Instead of him grabbing her aggressively and taking charge of this meeting, he gently slides his hand across to cover hers, and starts to kiss her sweetly by leaning towards her.  She starts to wake up to the thought that he really does love her, that she is finally free to decide to marry, and that it's allowed for her to lean towards him.  John next sees her run back to the man escorting her on this trip -- so we worry she'll ruin everything by turning him down again -- but she's only gone back to the first train to collect her luggage.  By joining John on his train going north, she signals that she is prepared to sit side by side with him for life, and that they are going \\"home\\" as an engaged couple.  This ending is carried off brilliantly by actor Richard A., who conveys an uptight, brooding man longing for the hope and happiness love can bring better than any other actor working. (While he loves to play villains, he is a tall, dark, and handsome leading man who is perfectly cast as a romantic hero.) He appears to be a great kisser, and a patient lover who will wait for a woman's full consent.  Women in the audience will like the way Miss Hale finally achieves a marriage which includes equality and partnership, instead of her having to marry a wealthy man in order to gain a position in society.  The recent deaths of so many key characters allow both Thornton and Miss Hale to realize that life is short, so any possible happiness must be seized, or lost forever.  This is a very soft, very romantic, very satisfying ending.  (USA directors would have made John's character use a John Wayne accent, grabbing MissHale and forcing her on to the correct train, saying something like, \\"Get your ass on this train; I'm planning to marry you... NOW, bitch!\\" etc.)

B001UW58WW|5.0|So enjoy listening to this CD...David Garrett is, to put it mildly, a genius. The music on this disc is a mix of wonderful songs.<br />Buy it and enjoy!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I'm 41 and I love this game. The hardest part is not reaching into your pocket and pulling out real money.  If you have patience your village will grow.  Very kid friendly.  Enjoy.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very very addictive. I can't stop play this game, its a fun way to waste some time.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was not at all what I was expecting.  The take the author has on vampires is unique.  I enjoy how she focuses on them being predators and developing that part of their nature though out the plot without loosing the characters personality.  I also enjoy her spin on witches.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Spielberg's animation was amazingly life like!  My grandchild and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Would recommend for a family movie night!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great quality!  Clear smooth sound.  These headphones are what I expected for the money. Fast shipping, no hassle, no regret.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the most compelling books I've ever read! I found myself grabbing a sentence or two every chance I got. I would never have read this book had someone explained the setting beforehand. I bought it blindly after hearing author Howey interviewed on NPR. I just bought the last two books of the trilogy and cannot wait to get started!
B003DWG29A|1.0|Don't waste your time with this one.  It was truly weird.  Need more variety on Amazon rather than these weird movies.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|George Benson might be aging, but he's getting better at the same time.  Despite many decades in the business, his guitar riffs are just as fast, stylish, and carefully crafted, and his voice just as clear, wide ranging, and sweet.  What a pleasure to listen to a skilled musician play a set of jazz and easy-listening standards solo or with a competent group of sidemen like Joe Sample, on piano; Harvey Mason, on drums, and Bob Williams, a new talent on the upright bass.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My grandkids love watching it with me on my ipad. Too bad there is only two seasons wish there were more available.
B00008BXJG|5.0|These remastered discs are excellent. I also like the inserts and how they show the original Aussie album cover art - which I prefer to the US version.
034544678X|4.0|This book provides some very basic understanding of the psychological and social differences between human primates and their canine partners. The most valuable thing I learned was how dogs approach each other to socialize and show affection (kind of sideways) vs. how humans do (full-on frontal to hug or shake hands). This alone has made me a better owner.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is a very good application and its alarm setting abilities are great. Wish it had more options for the alarm tunes, but that is fine.
068981528X|2.0|This story is wrong on so many levels. I give it two points for its twist of a familiar tale and for its graphic demolition scenes. But warm-fuzzy does not make good parody, unless it is served with a generous portion of irony, which is absent here. There is no credible basis for the pig's change of heart, nor does the story present any of the literary elements of redemption: suffering that leads to an awareness of the wrongdoing, real reconciliation, etc. If you think that beauty turns bad people into good ones, consider the Nazis, surrounded by fine art, great music and alpine scenery.<br /><br />In children's literature, the age-old formula of the villain getting his just desserts has survived because it works well, addressing our deep yearning for justice. Stories about universal goodness will probably not stand the test of time.<br /><br />Bullying is a serious problem that is best approached by setting firm limits while dealing with the bully's underlying problems. Teaching children that they can change psychopaths by showing them kindness and vulnerability is a recipe for disaster.
B0058SNKNS|5.0|Love these new Crocs.  I started wearing Crocs about 12 years ago when they were marketed as gardening shoes.  Since I have a multitude of health problems, I found myself wearing them more and more.  But they were big and clunky and just plain ugly.<br />These shoes are actually quite lovely, just like real shoes, but with all the Crocs comfort.  I could wear them anywhere, even with skirts.<br />The fit is fine for me.  I normally wear an 8 1/2, but they only come in whole sizes.  They recommend going up a size, but I have very narrow feet and felt I would walk right out of them.  So I ordered I a size 8 and it works well for me with my narrow feet, hammer toes and RA.  I also love the expresso color as it goes with 90% of my clothes.<br />All in all, a very worthwhile purchase for $23.  If there were more colors, I would order more.  It's wonderful to have all the Crocs comfort and feel comfortable wearing them in public.
B000089RV6|5.0|These remastered discs are excellent. I also like the inserts and how they show the original Aussie album cover art - which I prefer to the US version.
B005544TRQ|4.0|It does not have the lightness and speed  and  intimacy of WHITE COLLAR but it grows on you, and it has one of the villains you most like to hate, Pearson.
B009C7JS14|4.0|I like the way it has options for Fahrenheit and Celsius readings and the forecast available at finger tips. Anti virus software does say that this could be intrusive but I think that is because it has to know your location to operate.
B006O5YHUY|4.0|I liked it well enough. Not the best ever but definitely one of the better movies to come out in recent years.
B008602KQI|5.0|After reading the book, I was eager to see the movie.  I wasn't disappointed.  The film follows the story quite well.  The special effects were wonderful, especially the &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; clothing.  The acting was terrific even with a largely unknown (at the time) cast.<br />And Jennifer Lawrence did go on to win an Academy Award.<br />This is basically a story about violence, but I felt it was handled very well.  I never even had to shut my eyes.  All in all, it was a good story well portrayed on film.
1452126577|5.0|If you like grumpy cat, you will love this book. I was surprised at how much new material that I hadn't seen before was published in this book. Great coffee table book.
0756404746|5.0|I love this book. Love it for all the reasons others have said. I'm just writing to say that the synopsis on this Amazon page is silly. These books are delightful and fun where they need to be, deep and haunting where they need to be, but are never silly.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Rented it for my 5 and 7 year old boys.  They really seemed to enjoy it.  Looking forward to the sequel.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I loved the movie even though I was slightly disappointed by the Mandarin. I loved the first two the third is bitter sweet for me. I do believe that the story could have been a lot better. To top it off I'm sick of trilogies. That's great trilogies show the beginning, middle and end of a story. I'm tired of the third being a \\"Doom movie\\" for a character that I love.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This product is arguably one of the best applications out there for taking notes and such... and, if you can afford the yearly subscription, totally worth it.<br /><br />I recommend this for college students and folks who like to have their notes anywhere there's an internet communication (offline option available w/subscription I think). The automatic sync option also allows you to access your notes on your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop, making it super easy update your notes wherever and whenever you want.<br /><br />Four stars because of the $40/year optional subscription to access offline notes and 1 GB monthly memory limit (most people don't take that many notes, I do).
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This works great easy to use. This app doesn't use up the battery like others do. When I first used it I was amazed at how loud it was. My boyfriend could even hear it .
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a music designer and I love to play this while playing my music. I do not know why, but Minecraft. has always had a spot for me, and I loove playing it after a long days work on music. BUY IT NOW! :3
B00F91H15W|5.0|This is NOT an after school special. If you want a happy ending with a speech: \\"I guess I learned my lesson now, I love you mom and dad,\\" you will NOT find that here. As someone who grew up in Southern California and went to high school with people like those portrayed in the movie, I think \\"The Bling Ring\\" was spot-on. Sofia Coppola did a great job of making this true story darkly funny, visceral, and edgy, without trivializing the problems it presents.<br /><br />My best friend and I laughed A LOT the first time we saw this. We also cringed, gasped, almost cried, and spent hours afterward talking about wealth and materialism. The cinematography keeps you on the edge of your seat. The music coordinates perfectly with the mood of each scene, so even when you're totally against what the characters are doing, you feel like you are a part of it. The script is quotable and thought-provoking, and the actors are believable. Katie Chang is perfect to play the \\"ring leader\\", delivering her lines with such confident nonchalance that you understand why the other kids would follow her so blindly. Israel Broussard plays Marc, a depressed, misguided boy who is easy to relate to. Emma Watson plays Nicki, a drug-addled wannabe model, and does a very good job of delivering her hilarious lines in a convincing Valley Girl accent.<br /><br />I'm not giving too many details because I HATE when reviews include spoilers, but it should suffice to say that this film is equal parts jarring and fun. It will scare you, because the obsession with material wealth and social status is a very real issue, but it will make you laugh so hard you cry. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates dark humor and isn't afraid to think.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for kids and adults too, very fun to play! Could use some more levels but other than that it's great
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is a great game. It's a lot of fun and it's very cool that you can even play online with other players and it works fast. Sadly it takes a lot of races to get credits to buy and upgrade cars but it's worth it. Great graphics as well. You get so much for free. If you love cars and racing games download this now. :)
B007IUFBCM|4.0|This was a good album. I've waited a long time to buy it and i do not regret my purchase
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I thought this was a cute idea, but sometimes the alarm goes off, and sometimes not.  I was disappointed that the app was not more dependable as an alarm.  Good thing that I also set my alarm clock!
B000FCKPHG|4.0|The basic premise of this book( fixed vs. growth mindsets), is great.  I learned a great deal from the early chapters of this book.  I would really like to ideas on how to apply this in and educational setting with exercises to help students develop a growth mindset.  Unfortunately, the book becomes quite repetitive in the later chapters as same concepts are applied not only in education and on the job but also in romance and virtually every area of life.  It is as if the author claims to have found the solution to everything.  Just ignore the last chapters and get the good stuff at the beginning.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It Works so good it is the best if you have a hard time with fraction you need to get it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really liked it and I'm 10<br />years old I think it was riveting and spectacular.<br />Many people should read this book when they have a chance
B00846REIS|5.0|Just a great read, when you start you can not stop, Much better the &#34;Fifty Shades of gray&#34; hope we have some more books like this coming
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is simple, but entertaining.  I'm always looking for something to distract me when waiting at Doctors' appointments.  This is a great way to relax when you have time on your hands.  Good for young and old alike!
0307352145|1.0|I'm an extremely introverted woman(according to MBTI, I test as INTJ), but I could not relate to this book. I found that the author swept in too many other aspects of her temperament that were unrelated to introversion, and rolled it all into the &#34;introvert&#34; mash.<br /><br />I definitely can relate to needing alone time to process and recharge, and I also can relate to finding the clamor of large-scale social settings very unpleasant and exhausting. But the slow-to-think, unable to respond quickly, not assertive bits?? I don't relate to those things at all!<br /><br />Although people's first impression of me is that I am very soft-spoken and tranquil, the people who know me well know that I'm a  strong-willed, very assertive, opinionated person who just chooses to keep my thoughts to myself most of the time. When I choose to speak up, I am capable of speaking very authoritatively.<br /><br />I find that this author gives a very narrow distorted picture of introversion, based primarily on her personal experiences, without considering the full breadth of expression of  this particular trait. For a &#34;landmark&#34; book, I found it very disappointing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It definitely kept me captivated from the first page to the last. I never wanted it to come to an end!
B0063GORYU|5.0|2 decks, fast past and challenging. My new favorite game. I love it! You play against your self, so very challenging to better your time and score.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am happy to have Ebay on Kindle.  I don't shop on Ebay as much as I used to but I was really glad I didn't have to use my desktop.  I just browsed while anywhere in the house.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game challenges for everyone. Obstacles and chases get more intense as time elapsed and characters and awards add to the game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is reliable, consistent, not glitchy... I am very pleased with this app.  Excellent options within the app and easy to use.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was the first Lee Child book I've read. I'm a sporadic reader so if the book doesn't catch my interest pretty quick I will stop reading it. I did not stop reading this one, just the opposite, I couldn't stop reading it. With this being LC's first book, I would imagine they only get better. I will have to wait a couple of weeks to start another one because I shut out the rest of the world and heard about it from my wife.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This made me scratch my head forever because of how amazed I was dang another one down and one more to go
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game was one of the first things I downloaded when I bought my Kindle Fire HD. I am super addicted to this game. If you want to become a social outcast due to an addiction to a game, then this is the game for you.
B003VANOFY|5.0|When I first got the headset all setup and started using it, I was disappointed. The bass was way too high and made games sound muffled. This was quickly fixed by tweaking the bass and treble with the Logitech software for my tastes. After using this headset extensively for the past 5 days I can say without hesitation it is the best headset I have ever purchased. The sound quality is amazing, the 7.1 in this headset is as immersive as you're going to find for gaming. In Tomb Raider for instance I have been hearing sounds I've never heard before, from channels I didn't even know existed in-game before I got ahold of these badboys.<br /><br />The wireless range is amazing, actually reaches out a bit more than the specified 40ft before I get any audio interference or hitches. Being able to listen to music or talk to friends while nowhere near my PC is a great benefit. After having my Sharkoon 5.1 headset(also a great headset) for about 2 years I decided I wouldn't be buying a wired headset again, it just feels to restrictive. The headset has a good battery life, the charging dock's cable spool is also a great touch, no need having more USB cables tangling up with each other!<br /><br />The only thing that is SLIGHTLY lacking with the headset is the mic quality. It's not bad by any means, just a step down from my previous headset in terms of noise cancellation. The voice clarity is an improvement over my previous headset though, it just tends to pick up more background noises than I'd like. My old headset didn't pick up much background noise at all, couldn't even here me typing on my keyboard. With this mic I have to turn down the mic volume to try and counter-act the lack of noise cancellation. This mic will pick up keystrokes,mouse clicks and pretty much everything else. Setting it at half volume seems to have helped that issue a decent amount, at least by making it less obnoxious.<br /><br />Overall this is an amazing headset and getting it at $105 feels like it wasa major steal. If you're looking for a new headset and want great quality sound, large wireless range and good battery life look no further!
B001EYU1VO|5.0|Wasn't expecting too much, I plain on spending $450 for a different one soon tho. I ended up buying this to see what games work well with joysticks and how much fun it would be.<br /><br />I've found works best with BF3. Can't get enough of the Helis in there.<br /><br />Only negative so far is the big gap that appears when you adjust it for bigger hands. Realistically, the longest setting is for a mans hand, while the smallest is for a child. So you may run into the same problem I did. However, please note that I play aggressively.<br /><br />I ended up putting caulking in the gaps so my hand wouldn't be in pain while going crasy
0071636080|5.0|It is very interesting and it is a good book that tells about his own ideas and his secret life.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book is clear, it walks you thru all the steps. It is a great guidebook and I highly recommend it.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|If you have played any of the Scribblenauts games in the past then this game is for you. I have played them all and this is probably the third best. It's simple write down a word and it appears. Use the object to help you obtain the starite and win the level. I highly suggest you use wings to reach high places, or put a saddle on Cthulhu and ride him to the North Pole to invade Christmas Land.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book really reaches inside you and gets into your core. The characters are all as real as real can be, and you are back there with them experiencing the atrocities of WWII from an up-close perspective. Very well written, and very uniquely presented. You will not be disappointed in this book!!!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Every season has topped the other. The cast, the story, action and of course the &#34;scenery&#34; :) is just unmatched when it comes to these mini series. Wish it would never end.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game is pretty difficult for my daughter to get through even the first section. Should be more kid friendly.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|Amazing album. I bought this A few days ago, only planning to buy this one, but it was amazing and I couldn't resist buying another evanescence album.if you're a rock fan, a metalhead, or just a guy that likes music, then this album will blow your mind. This is my new favorite band
B0089LOG02|5.0|Held my attention -- a true story from America's past.<br />Never knew this had happened in our past.<br />Enjoyed reading.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I held back buying this Reacher book after hearing that Tom Cruise played him in a film. I enjoy the character but this decision virtually emasculated the picture painted by the author of the Reacher character. It was a bit like asking Lindsay Lohan to play Margaret Thatcher. The book flows well as does most of Child's past versions of this character.<br /><br />This encouraged me to purchase 'Never Go Back' since the downloads are now more reasonably priced.<br /><br />I was upset that 'Deep Down&#34; was attached as a freebie since I had purchased it two years ago.
B00F5F0208|2.0|There was no warning in regards to this and being it is digital no way of changing as far as I know
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Not a trek fan but this movie was good. A lot of action, a lot of twists and suspense A+!
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Cute game with good graphics and I love the playing the game, but I can't add friends. I am playing on a Kindle Fire and when I go to the Add by Farm ID mine is grayed out.  I have been working with Fun Plus Support and tried everything they have suggested, but nothing has worked. I have no problem logging into facebook, I just can't add friends.  I would give it a much higher review if this was fixed. Hopefully the problem will be fixed soon because you need friends to complete tasks.<br />Please add me I am a daily player! My ID: EAPGXGD Farm Name: Doolittleville<br /><br />Thank you
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I really loved this game. Challenging at times, I absolutely LOVE THIS GAME! Especially since it was free. I enjoyed being challenged and winning trophies.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Got this app for my daughter to play with and she only really messed around with it.  She came pretty bored after a while.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|I have to admit, for the most part the Aps for Kindle have been disappointing. Many require GPS and Kindle doesn't have it. Many are of just poor design. Worst is the inability to search for pages in Kindle; you are forced to go page by page until you get the one you want. For reading a book, Kindle is fine but I wouldn't recommend it for any other purpose. I've given up on the Aps.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone! It was amazing! Keeps you wanting to read until you have read the very last word.  I loved how it wasn't predictable.
B00DJXSKWU|3.0|I got this game and it was Great,BUT there was a bug when ever I played the game it went upside down and when I tried to flip it the right side it went upside down! 3 stars
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|Got this app for my daughter because she's all into Doc McStuffin's.  She loves being a little nurse.  Perfect for those little 3-4 year old aspiring nurses.
B00AEFY552|5.0|I think it's great this product!<br />It works great! is very practical!<br />Excellent graphics! pictures are great! the movie is fabulous
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've used kik on my kindle fire for months, and I never had an issue until now. It used to work perfectly.<br /><br />When I try to log into my kik account, it loads and loads, and loads. Then a message appears and says &quot;an error occurred, logging in is taking longer, try again in a bit.&quot;<br /><br />I've waited for two days hoping it would fix, I thought it was just getting an update, but nothing happened.<br /><br />I've tried deleting all my content, even deleted kik numerous times, I  tried creating a new kik account. Nothing worked.<br /><br />Someone needs to fix this issue, it's annoying, because I deleted all my kindle data and kik still doesn't work.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have read all of Sanderson's books and this one held me enthralled the most. What I appreciated the most about it is that there is closure to the story. Some of his books leave you frustrated for the next one and while I understand the &#34;hook&#34; to buy the next one, it would leave me frustrated. This one closes nicely while still leaving a plot to continue the story in the next book. Highly recommended. My family was irritated that I could not put it down. Great story.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Dont need to watch Star Trek The Wrath of Khan to enjoy this.  It will help a lot tho with if you did.<br />See R2D2 in the movie ?
B002UD56I6|5.0|I think it's great this product!<br />It works great! is very practical!<br />Excellent graphics! pictures are great! dances are excellent!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Not all math problems are shown how the answer was arrived at but often time knowing the answer gives hints to how it was found.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I loved the apocalyptic feel and the characters! Got to love a short read and it was different from all his other stuff.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for. Downloaded several apps to help clear up some memory and they weren't as effective as this one. My KFHD has been acting a little buggy lately and I'm still not sure if there's malware or what on my device but I'll keep this app handy until then.
B0093QE37S|5.0|I just love Hepburn, Grant and Stewart in this movie.  It is fun to watch this great trio working together.
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|I had heard the book was good but nothing about the movie. I did enjoy the story line, but it was sad.
B00EO2I6XS|4.0|As a former student of Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein, whose expertise regards the Holocaust, the theological implications of the Holocaust, and decades of studying mass murder and genocide, this film was a must see for me.<br /><br />Fortunately, All Saints Cinema in Tallahassee, Florida, our independent films site, showed the film last weekend and will be again this upcoming weekend (today being Wednesday, September 25th).<br /><br />The film provided me with a deeper knowledge of Hannah Arendt, the trial, and the aftermath for her professional reputation.  Substantial raw footage of the trial was a critical aspect of the film.<br /><br />Her books include \\"The Origins of Totalitarianism\\" (1951). Revised ed.; New York: Schocken, 2004. (Includes all the prefaces and additions from the 1958, 1968, and 1972 editions.); \\"The Human Condition\\" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958); \\"On Revolution\\" (New York: Viking, 1963); \\"Men in Dark Times\\" (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1968); \\"On Violence\\" Harvest Books (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1970). (Also included in Crises of the Republic.); \\"Life of the Mind\\", unfinished at her death, Ed. Mary McCarthy, 2 vols. (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978). ISBN 0-15-107887-4; \\"Love and Saint Augustine\\". [her dissertation] Edited with an Interpretive Essay by Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott and Judith Chelius Scott (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1996/1998).<br /><br />\\"In her reporting of the 1961 Adolf Eichmann trial for \\"The New Yorker\\", which evolved into \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\\" (1963), she coined the phrase \\"the banality of evil\\" to describe Eichmann. She raised the question of whether evil is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions and inaction. She was sharply critical of the way the trial was conducted in Israel. Shealso was critical of the way that some Jewish leaders, notably M. C. Rumkowski, acted during the Holocaust. This caused a considerable controversy and even animosity toward Arendt in the Jewish community. Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Shoah, also known as the Holocaust.<br /><br />\\"Due to this lingering criticism, her book has only recently been translated into Hebrew. Arendt ended the book by writing:<br /><br />  'Just as you [Eichmann] supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations -- as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world -- we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you.

B003QTSMXE|5.0|At first it was hard to fathom robots in our world, but it is not so strange now to think they could be around.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I'm 23 and can't help loving this album. Its pulling me back to the 90's and early 2000's, not to mention the girl can sing. My favorites are Honeymoon Avenue, Baby I, Piano, Almost Is Never Enough and The Way. Reminds me sooo much of early Mariah Carey, let's hope the pressures of fame don't corrupt a promising talent. Buy this album!!
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|Their music speaks to a maturity you do not see in EDM music. You can hear Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson influences. I can't stop listening to it, although I wish they did not lead off with \\"fire starts to burn\\". It's my least favorite, so I needed to rearrange the playlist.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|They Took the old and outdated D. and made him into a Hero of Today. Chris Eccleston was perfect, and I think it sad that he played it for such a short period
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I honestly wasn't expecting much for the price but I was very pleasantly surprised. I won't give spoilers but the characters are well developed, I loved the plot twists and the world created by Hugh Howey is frighteningly real and terrifying.
1476734941|3.0|Having watched the BBC documentary (free on the internet), I found this book little more than a re-hash of the info there.<br /><br />The diet is simple: two non-consecutive days a week of a calorie controlled (600 calories for men, 500 for women) diet. The diet itself is not so much about weight loss, but more a holistic lifestyle with the added benefit of weight loss.<br /><br />The book does include a few tips of how to get through the 'fasting' days, and some basic calorie information, but was it worth the money? It really isn't much more than a re-hash of the documentary.
0865478767|4.0|A collection of short, accessible essays on translation.  Some defend the translator's work against common prejudices; some describe how translation is practiced at the UN and the EU.  Bellos, the author, is skeptical of what I, in laymen's terms, would call linguistic reductionism, or the idea that languages can be reduced to vocabularies and grammars.  Bellos glories in the different human languages, but still firmly believes that communication is possible among them.<br /><br />Worth reading.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great presentation based on historically accurate facts.  Excellent directing and acting.  I would have liked to have known Abraham Lincoln.  The movie did a great job of presenting a most interesting man with great patience and unusual interpersonal skills and powers of persuasion.  He was a a real gift to America that kept it as the United States.  I shudder to think that the United States could have been permanently divided, and that slavery and the hardships of African-American could have been extended for a much longer time.  I plan to see this movie many more times.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Game is challenging and fun. Kind of hard to navigate on own but thank goodness for the quick refill hints.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is a fun, easy to play game despite the low visual definition. But the kicker is, the music!!! The music is atrociously hilarious!!! The music sounds like the background music to a corporate anti-sexual harassment video, filmed in the 80's!!! Nothing too special about the game itself, it has the special power-ups for matching 4 or 5 of the same jewels. Basic, but good! It's just the music though! I'm sure if you get this game, you'll laugh and know what I'm talking about!!! Enjoy!!! (If not the game, then the horrible music)
B006GWO5NE|1.0|still is loose.  Does not keep charge on Kindle for any length of time. This was a gift and I only had the unit a month and a half before the cable stopped working. I had to pay for shipping for a new one . Very disappointed
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I am so glad that Eric Blehm conducted such detailed research on the life of Adam Brown.  It goes to show that no life is ever totally wasted or not able to be redeemed.  An amazing man whose actions should be preserved in our history to show the good side of being an American hero.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a great read-aloud book with your kids. It brings up so many issues that kids face in school and in life that our conversations have been phenomenal.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Val Kilmer was overlooked for the Academy Awards.  What a great performance.  Visually stimulating and fun to watch.  You just can't go wrong with a western, you just can't go wrong with great performances, and you can't go wrong with incredible costumes.  Sam Elliott of my you are a COWBOY take it from this cowgirl from Texas
1904633005|5.0|Love this book so much.  If you're a woman, it's a &#34;must read.&#34;  Love everything about Jane Austin....her humour, wit and clever observation of human nature.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The books are incredible and I'm so looking forward to the third. Amanzon says that 8 more words are required.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Decent story, solid acting and a script with a hint of the movie Outbreak. Overall, a fun and action-packed movie!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|great cast, uplifting and funny.  Alan Rickman and Emma Thompsons story line was real and heart wrenching at the same time.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Really good design, normal size, good quality. Fits everything related to my camera. You get much more for the price.
B00F91FRTO|1.0|Boring. I don't know why I thought this would be a good movie; however it was junk. Time I'll never get back
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is probably the best version of temple run out there<br />lots of power ups and it keeps things fun.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Neat tricks, good twist on the edge of your seat! I wanted to see this the second it came out in theaters! Not saying anymore to spoil the surprises.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Visual is very clear. It is easy to play. I will play this a lot because I like Mahjongg games. I would recommend it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a great mouse. I was worried the side buttons might get in the way but they're actually well placed and convenient. The driver software (which you download from the Anker site- there's no driver cd in the box) is easy to use and lets you program all the buttons on the mouse. It even lets you change the color of the Anker logo or turn it off completely if you don't like it. This mouse is lighter than my last mouse (Sidewinder X8) but not terribly so.<br />Don't let the price mislead you, this is a nice product.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Hilarious movie. Great quality streaming by amazon as usual. I didn't know that Anna Kendrick had such a good voice.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|A little sad, but, entertaining. Cruise is always interesting to watch. It had a happy but, weird feeling ending with the &#34;replacement&#34; cruise, but, it is what it is.....a baby always makes it cute.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|Cameron Diaz was irritating.  The story lacked what was needed to turn it into a heartwarming story, even after the babies were born
B00DYEBM3I|4.0|A number of years ago I was dealing with the death of a friend, the departure of a girlfriend, and a generally bleak outlook on life. At the time, I happened to hear \\"Into Dust\\" on a TV show, and I bought the album \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\". I've loved Mazzy Star ever since for the hopeful melancholy that helped me in a dark time. Even after my outlook changed I kept listening to the album, and years later I still enjoy it. This most recent album is a solid continuation of that. I was actually surprised with how much like their previous efforts this album sounds. Too often a band feels the needs to change a winning formula, to dramatically alter their sound in order to gain new fans. While I did notice some small changes (I never hear a slide guitar in their previous efforts), overall, this is a worthy successor to the previous albums. If you like their old sound, you'll like this. While there is no clear, catchy single on this record, the overall quality does not suffer for the omission. For someone new to their work, I'd recommend \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" as a starting point, but you could do worse than to pick this as a second choice. For diehard fans, this is definitely worth picking up.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|packaged well. Great toilet. Flushes everything down fast.This replaced a round bowl and fitted in same smsll area so it does not hit door
B00F35BV64|3.0|I really enjoy the Star Trek movies, I don't think they are garnered for new younger generation fans, as a lot of the jokes are really sentimental and the character familiarity is based on what we know from watching the originals. But, I enjoyed it, &#34;Damit Jim, I am doctor&#34;, makes me laugh everytime. I love the action, the acting is great, top notch and I love the humor. It just needs to connect a little bit more with the characters when they are not in bar fights or on the ship.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I think that the studio did a wonderful job on this movie. It is probably a little scary for the little folk.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Very entertaining and funny! Our 8 year old son and us love these characters! We've been watching over and over!
B00EN8OAGU|1.0|I thought this would be a fun read instead it was filled with foul language that did nothing for the story.  The preview was misleading - I did not finish this book - waste of money.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I am the first to admit that I LOVE inspirational, feel good, happy endings! World War Z is none of these! However, even though I am not the gaga usual type over Brad Pitt...the man can act. I think this was well written, well executed and somehow seems feasible. There are some, did that really just happen moments. Some Wow, that makes sense moments and one, really?? moment. But, overall I am glad I saw it and really quite satisfied with the story. Like I said, this is not a GI Joe action flick, it is more of a thinker action flick. It goes fast, starts immediately, which ads to the intensity. It does not slow down for you to have that sensitive moment....there is no time, THESE ARE ZOMBIES MAN!!!!
B00CIU3IVS|4.0|What a fantastic collection for such an epic film. This album definitely introduced me to some new favorites. Loving this soundtrack.

B003XRELGQ|5.0|Amazing book. Every sentence is either a deep insight into the nature of things, or a sharp satire. You won't regret reading it
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This charming YA book really got me on the emotional level. John Green is such a talented writer and he does a great job portraying the voice of a teenage girl.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|Seriously. The most intrusive ads I have ever seen in an app. Free isn't a low enough price. A video ad followed by a popular picture ad. Good grief!

B007SGM084|5.0|What can I say...this is a must read. You will NOT be able to lay it down until you are finished. Very sexual and keeps your attention.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I ordered this boxed set because it was the only version of the original trilogy I could find for less than $100. But when I sat down to watch one of the movies with my roommates, I found that not only does it have the strangely modified versions of the movies, it doesn't have an option to watch the original version. I am going to do everything I can to return these DVDs or pawn them off to someone else, as I ordered a set of movies from my childhood, not some 3D CG movies. For those of you looking to buy, it is a lot cheaper than many other boxed sets, so if you don't mind the original movies being tweaked with brutal CGI, feel free to buy.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|This movie was just awful. I'm sure it was designed to reach an audience who reads the book, and I don't. The dialogue was trite, the action was silly, and the acting was wretched. Tom Cruise at his worst.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It is so wonderful to have an app like this. As a student I never got very far in other languages other than English, in Spanish everyone else spoke it at home too, and I took Japanese for all the wrong reasons. Now I am trying to learn French just for fun (it's free so why not) so going at my own speed I have a better grasp on what I'm doing and can practice what I don't get without fear of being left behind by the class.<br />Plus it's fun! With a exp bar, levels and points. Though I do wish it meant more than just bragging rights. It is cool however to be the one leveling up rather than a character meant to be you and gaining a real skill as you go.<br /><br />In short duolingo is free, fun and  effective and considering how much something like this cost usually either at college or the ridiculously over priced roesseta stone why would you pass this up? If at some point you decide the language you started with  isn't you change it or stop and lose nothing than find that out in the middle of a semester  .
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really love this app!! It's so accurate! Especially since I planned my trip to northern cali I was able to dress appropriate!
B0089EHWQE|3.0|This story was very well written.  It was entertaining and engaging! I enjoyed the female main character immensely. The ending of this story left me torn.  I really liked the book, but I was not impressed with the way the story ended. To me it felt unbelievable. I probably would recommend this book to those who read a lot.  If this is one of the few books you read in a year I would skip this one.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I read this book again.  This time was different for many reasons: I am older, I am the mother of a terminally ill child, and I read it as an E-book.  However, Morrie's life lessons ring true and are ever applicable.<br /><br />If you have not read this book, please do.  Then, you can lead a richer life.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|I went to see it in theaters as soon as it was released I was so exited! And I wasn't disappointed at all! The animation is spectacular, the plot is captivating, and there's plenty of witty action from start to finish. They really did The Adventures of Tintin justice with this movie. From start to finish it had me quite interested. A must buy for anybody!!!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|I thought this was the &#34;House of Cards&#34; that everyone was talking about so I settled in looking for Kevin Spacey. Immediately I fell in love the the British humor and the cast and decided that it was too good to turn off. I watched all four episodes in one sitting! I will say that I was surprised how it went from entertaining to very creepy by the end of season one. I will watch the next season though.
B000P407K4|5.0|Wonderful movie. Peter sellers is brilliant, playing several roles, and George C Scott is over the top. Writing is clever funny, and subversive. Slim Pickens and the rest of the casting are all perfect. A movie ahead of it's time, and still relevant for it's satire.
0156034026|5.0|Wonderful read. The thought of one man, talking to another man, and keeping me hanging was great. The book is very thought provoking, leading me to wonder who are we? And what are we doing in this world to cause so many countries to hate us? The ending left me hanging, which our Book Club totally hashed out with no real ending that we all agreed on. Still, it was very stimulating and a totally deep book.I highly recommend it.
B00F91H666|5.0|This is the best movie I have Seen all year it puts you on the end of you seat begging for more!!!
B00DQVSTCG|4.0|I almost hate to be that annoying guy who comes on here and smugly proclaims \\"Everything worked fine for me!\\" but the truth is, this Blu-Ray really did work just fine for me, lol. In fact, anticipating the horror to come after reading so many bad reviews, I actually bought the DVD version as well, and now that I've had to chance compare them both firsthand, I must say that  the Blu-Ray really does put the DVD to shame in nearly every way. (Well, maybe not every way. The disc menu is a total nightmare to navigate and it took maybe a minute of random button pushing just to get the thing to play at all, but once it did, we were kosher.) Now, I don't know a thing about surround sound or fancy speakers or anything like that, but as far as just popping the disc into a standard player with standard settings, everything looked and sounded wonderful. True, there's a good amount of grain that's noticeable when the image is predominately dark, mostly with audience shots, but that's pretty par for the course with Blu-Rays today, and when focusing on the stage and Madonna herself, the colors are bright and vibrant and crisp. At times the audio also sounds \\"off,\\" like perhaps it was re-dubbed post-production, but I'm inclined to say that's due more in part to poor editing choices than actual technical defects. At least it was clear. Now I'm not saying that the other 95% of the people complaining here are mistaken in their concerns, since obviously enough people experienced legitimate problems to warrant an official recall of this product, but who knows, maybe I just got lucky.<br /><br />In regards to the concert itself, it's just phenomenal. I'm a lifelong admirer of Madonna - with the tattoo to prove it, lol - but have also learned to look at her with a more objective and critical eye in recent years. The Hard Candy album was an embarrassing, awful mess on every level, and MDNA was a mixed bag to say the least. (The songs that are good are REALLY good, but the songs that are bad are REALLY bad.) The subsequent MDNA tour, however, proved once again that in spite of her waning musical inspirations, she is still unmatched as a live performer and you can't help but be left breathless. In fact, I even left the show with a newfound appreciation for some songs that up until that point I only considered filler, such as I'm a Sinner and Turn Up the Radio. Most of the \\"Madonna classics\\" such as Vogue and Express Yourself are played straight, as opposed to the Sticky and Sweet Tour where everything was remixed beyond recognition, which I admit was a nice change this time around. Like a Virgin was slowed way down, and in conjunction with the nearly acapella Love Spent, made for the most poignant segment of the night - although I absolutely hate the way that part was edited for home release. (Still photos? Really?) In fact you'll probably find the editing in general to be a bit jarring at first; I don't think any single camera shot lingers for more than one or two seconds at a time. It's definitely a fast-paced flurry of images that perhaps tries a bit too hard to be stylish, and the \\"feels like I'm there\\" concept is totally tossed out the window, but it's a fun ride while it lasts and you'll still appreciate the fact that when it comes to live performances, even after all these years, Madonna truly invests everything she's got and doesn't settle for anything less than epic.d are REALLY bad.)

B006PFC2S2|4.0|Fun movie. Love the dancing and the musical numbers. The songs stick in your head all day wish the images were a bit more sharp
B00DL47ORO|5.0|These are animals. No matter how well trained or loved from cat, dog or whale things will happen unexpectedly. I found this to be interesting and have never really been fond of zoos, not that they are necessarily bad, but the boredom of the animals drives them crazy. Through this documentary and there a similar one Fall from Freedom, it's quite terrible how they go about the capture of the wild animals and if you watch or read enough about the specie itself. These are pretty bad conditions to keep something intelligent in and their families.<br /><br />I'd recommend this a watch. It's not a happy doc for sure.
B000FBJF3M|4.0|Pompeii tells a great, thrilling story! I am really looking forward to reading more of Robert Harris's novels.  Great Roman historical fiction.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed the premise of taking the old adage that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely; and turning it into a great story. I found this book fast paced as well as thought provoking. I hope the rest of the series is as poignant.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|It's a great show. I've should had watch this long time ago but it's better this way Amazon Prime has given me the complete season it's great.  :)

006220629X|2.0|After having read The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game, I was very disappointed in The Prisoner of Heaven.  While the first two reads took me on a somewhat surreal flight of mystery through old Barcelona, with interesting and intriguing characters, this book seemed to fall flat almost all the way through.  I felt that the characters were never developed to the extent that they were in the earlier books.  In fact, most of the same characters rose to the surface in Prisoner of Heaven, but the circumstances didn't seem to match their development in the earlier books. It made events feel unconnected, as if this book might have been created by a different writer, using the same characters without much regard for their prior situations.<br /><br />I found it nearly impossible to fix my mind's eye on just how old Fermín Romero de Torres was supposed to be.  And how he came to be the best friend of Daniel Sempere seems one of the biggest, if unintended, mysteries of the book.<br /><br />Many of the events seemed contrived, including the visit to the cemetery of forgotten books.  And so many loose ends are left hanging in the story.  The fact that a suitcase could remain to be found in a railway locker for twenty years, or that one character would keep a key for which he has no use whatever in his pocket for twenty years during which he was in such dire straights as to be lucky to even have a pocket (and in fact, at one point didn't!), are other mysteries that plagued me more than the ones intended by the author.<br /><br />And the ending is left hanging, a clear entree to the next story.<br /><br />Apparently, this book appeals to some, and not to others.  I'm in the second camp. While it was engaging in sections - mostly the prison scenes - it was disappointing overall, and left me feeling like I could have spent my time better with another book.  This one could be stashed on an obscure shelf in the cemetery of forgotten books, as far as I'm concerned.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Jenna's character is surrounded by even more awesome characters.  This comedic portrayal of an average teenager is not so average in its content.  It is quirky and definitely has an underlying tone of realness amongst the over the top drama.  There is a character for everyone to identify with in one way or another.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's easy to use, and I love how their prices are usually the cheapest around! Worth downloading, I mean it.
1469984202|5.0|I found Hugh Howey's Wool a refreshing change from the typical post-apocalyptic writing. The storyline is unique and the characters are fully developed and very believable. Each chapter draws you further into the depths of the silo leaving the reader wanting more. Thank goodness Mr. Howey didn't stop with Wool! His Shift Series is equally intriguing.  Unlike many book series which tend to loose their momentum, these works keep getting better and better.  Real talent from a real writer.  Keep them coming.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book was excellent but I am not surprised. Preston and Child are counted on my short list of favorite authors. It was fun finding out a little more about Constance Green! Take the time to read all of Preston and Child's novels including their novels as individuals Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston. They are all excellent!
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|I first saw Shane as a child shortly after it was released to local movie houses. The movie impressed me then and now nearly 60 years later it still hits the mark and fulfills as one of the finest westerns ever filmed.  At the time, it was a western like none we had ever seen and I believe it changed the genre, in the best of ways, forever.  The new blu ray does not disappoint.  The detail in the film is remarkable (costumes, set design and decoration, the script, etc.) and the cinematography is still beautiful and propels the story forward.  George Steven's direction is dead on...and the understated performances make for very real characters.  If you are a fan of western movies, this blu ray is a definite must and, if you, like me, already have the dvd and wonder if it is worth the upgrade....believe me, once you see this you will be very glad you made the purchase.  The use of the Grand Tetons as the backdrop for this story is shear pleasure....it just adds to the beauty of this film, but does not take away from the reality of this perfect western.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I've always been interested in reading the many children's books about the orphans who were shipped out west from eastern cities.  This is the first book for adults that I have found and I recommend it.  Set mainly in the 1930's at the end of th,e orphan train era, this story of an Irish orphan who relocates in Minnesota is very heartwarming.

B00BLF9FOK|4.0|I dont understand why this movie got so many bad reviews. It has plenty of action, some humor and violence which is classic Swarzeneggar..Sure Arnie is way past his prime \\"Commando\\" days, and at 66 years he gets it done nonetheless.  And it's got a plot a 3 year old would understand but who cares..Arnie movies are meant for entertainment and this one doesnt disappoint.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Command and Control reads like a techno-thriller.  Eric Schlosser takes the most destructive and scary nuclear accident in American history and uses it as a needle to thread a narrative about the sloppiness and inflexibility of America's nuclear weapons program that almost guaranteed that nuclear weapons accidents were fated to occur.  That we haven't had a vast, deadly, nuclear weapons incident is due mainly to luck and God - and mostly to God according to some weapons analysts.<br /><br />The scariest incident occurred in 1980 when a Titan II missile exploded in its silo in Damascus, Arkansas (back when Bill Clinton was governor) and blew a live nuclear warhead over 200 yards into a ditch.  He tells this story in detail through eyewitness accounts and good research and interrupts the story throughout the book with sections on nuclear weapons history, other incidents, and a superb explanation of American and Soviet nuclear strategies in the Cold War.<br /><br />Schlosser shows how ramshackle the atomic weapons program really was and how and why these weapons were eventually removed from civilian control under the Atomic Energy Commission and turned over to the military (and it's not because the military were more competent).  He traces this history back from the 1940s right up to the Obama administration's lukewarm proposal to ban all nuclear weapons.<br /><br />He shows that we have come through some pretty tough stuff in atomic history and we are a little further from the brink - but we should be very afraid when we consider that India, Pakistan, China, and the other members of the nuclear club may have less ability or incentive to try and contain atomic weaponry as we finally learned to do.<br /><br />He doesn't preach or analyze. He is a brilliant reporter and has written a gripping and fascinating story.  And it's all true.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Still one of the best series for the past years. And the last 2 movies were just unbelievably awesome. You need to finish your harry potter collection if you dont already own this
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book with a passion. Recommend it to anyone over the age of thirteen. Beautifully written with a great plot line. A book that really makes you think. Five stars all the way.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I was expecting much more...not a bad movie but I should have waited for it to be on Red Box.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|After downloading this app, my antivirus app flagged it as adware. I uninstalled it immediately. Other users have noted that this app shows ongoing pop ups for other products.
B008220AVW|5.0|must have for any katy perry fan. Its one of my favorite documentaries of an artist, and I got a look inside her life finally.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Ok, now I totally understand why they call Mr.Martin the American Tolkien. As a monster fan of Tolkien' s Lord of the Rings(seriously, I've read it about two hundred times, no joke) I did not think I would ever find another series that would even come close to it. This does. Is it as great as TLOTR? Not quite but close enough it hardly matters. Let's just say I NEVER buy books, I always look for free ones and I have over five hundred since December. I just BOUGHT all five in this series and don't regret it a bit.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Got this a a gift for my minecraft addicted child and she loooooooooves it.  Good quality, just like other lego sets.  I didnt pay attention when I ordered it and thought because of the price it would be a lot bigger, but the whole kit came in a pretty small box.  Well worth it though even at the price, I am sure it will get hours and hours of play and will likely buy the other two sets on here.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl brings us the real deal here. This rockdoc has inspired me to start a new music venture at 56 years old (you're never too old to rock and roll!).
B001NLL93W|5.0|I absolutely love TMI series! It is very addicting that I have read the whole series 3 times! Just patiently waiting for May 2014 to get here for the next book!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's so awesome and if your not  Adam  spoiler alerts look away.now. Rowley and a girl named Abigail start dating at the end.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|. It's soooo fun and nothing is wrong with it, like no glitches or loading problems. Most free games like this try to sell you stuff or make a level cost money but none off that and add free. This is so addicting  that I could play for hours . If you get this game a promise you will be impressed!! :)
B0089DQBQC|3.0|I suspect this was more edgy back in RLS's day.  I was expecting it to start getting to the good stuff and then the book ended... Maybe I've been desensitized.
B002VWNID6|1.0|The DVD does not play all the way through. Some type of glitch that stops it half way through it.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|F.M.J is a movie that i will enjoy and have everyone in my family enjoy forever. one if not the greatest film!!!!!
0465068367|5.0|I was a mediocre student of history. Never really finding history interesting enough to keep my attention. Iris Chang, takes a horrific period of time, and makes it so I cannot put it down. Her research, her writing, makes the reader a part of this great tragedy still not fully atoned for. It brings to light another episode of mans inhumanity to man that was swept under the carpet and hidden. If not for Iris Chang, I never would have known about this. But also she does a follow up for the main characters who were the good guys and lets you know how this tragedy affected them. It is truly a sad story, but written by a superb author who was taken from us to early. This book is truly a must read for people who believe that there are people in the world suffering cruelty beyond imagination who have no voice. This book gives a voice to those people and creates discussion.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I liked this book for a few reasons...<br />1) it challenged my beliefs on diet...I plan on trying to add more plants to mine<br />2) Scott isn't afraid to discuss the hard things in life like death, depression and suicide<br />3) some great running stories (I love running)<br />4) Minnesota!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|I love Zombies which it why of course I wanted to see this movie in the first place. While it was a good film I felt it was very slow at some points. It did look great in 3D with all the high flying zombie action it does have regardless of the slow bits.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|enertainment for everyone. always enjoy no matter how many times i watch it. a must see and pass on to younger generations too watch!!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|it's fun but I keep getting stuck. if I tap on to share on Facebook, it won't give me coins.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Flowed nicely. Jobs was jerk but a smart man and you have have to give him recognition for his contributions to technology/society.<br />Learned a lot by reading this book.
B00797MB0O|5.0|This movie is mesmerizing to me because my high school experience was the exact opposite of &#34;the most popular girl in school&#34;.  I cannot relate to the main character, but I like trying.
