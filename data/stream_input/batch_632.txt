B000JLTRJ0|3.0|If you like the titanic, then this is for you. <br />The titanic was also a horrible event, with large amounts of victims, if not more. <br />Both movies get into the personal lives of the casting members, although 911 was very deliberate, both titanic and trade center events took place due to neglagence and not just human error. <br /> <br />If your attempting to do research on some historical facts pertaining to the events surrounding 911, then I DONOT recommend this flick. <br /> <br />It is also unfortunate to have a male cocassion playing the role of a black marine who went on a night vigil for victims to resue. <br /> <br />It would appear that this is just another hit-piece made to order by the global elite who wish not to be known for owning the financial institutions of this present evil world. <br /> <br />OPERATION MOCKINGBIRD (Google it!)

B000002J2F|5.0|It took me a while to warm up to this album, being I was introduced to their pre-trio stuff before it. I hated it at first, but now it's either my #1 favorite or second behind Selling England By The Pound. Either way, it's a must-buy for any  Genesis fan because they're not really prog, but not sappy, bland pop like Invisible Touch. Time for my traditional song-by-song review:    1. Behind The Lines -10/10- I'd love to see them open their reunion tour shows with this song and follow with the rest of the hidden \\"Duke suite\\". I can't get enough of Duke.    2. Duchess -10/10- Their first song featuring drum machine (I think, but I'm not sure) and it's got a great result... This time. I think the drum machine eventually led to their slow decay which I believe came full-circle by Invisible Touch.    3. Guide Vocal -10/10- Emotionally charged lyrics and vocals. Very short, but it's kind of like canned orange juice. It's condensed. And when you add water (the rest of the Duke suite) it's awesome.    4. Man Of Our Times - 8.5/10- I loved this song at first, but now the coda kind of irritates me. Otherwise, it's good.    5. Misunderstood -10/10- Insanely catchy. That's all I can say.    6. Heathaze -10/10- Brings you back to the days of Wind and Wuthering. Kind of melancholy and quiet.    7. Turn It On Again -10/10- This song used to annoy me mercilessly, but now I really like this song. Maybe it's because I found out it's in 13/4 time. I'm such a prog snob.    8. Alone Tonight -8/10- Not bad, but not one of my favorites.    9. Cul-de-Sac -10/10- This has a very unique energy to it and I really can't compare it to anything else, other than other Duke songs. It's not like A Trick of the Tail or any albums preceding this  one, but it's different from anything from Abacab on. I guess it could fit on Abacab.    10. Please Don't Ask -N/A/10- I'd rather not rate it because it's BAD. I never listen to it. I like to just remove it from my playlist altogether because it interrupts the flow between Cul-de-Sac and Duke's Travels.    11. Duke's Travels -10/10- INSANE keyboard solo. Woohoo!!!! The vocals add a lot of emotion to it. It's like adding chocolate chips onto a chocolate-frosted chocolate cake. Awesome. Then you add a cherry on top with the little flute-thing at the end where it goes \\"Do. Do. Do do do. Do do do dooooooooo... Do, Do. Do. Do do do. Do do do do do do do do...    12. Duke's End -10/10- ...BAM!!!\\" And now after that chocolate-frosted chocolate cake with chocolate chips and a cherry, we get a sweet coda that mimics Behind the Lines. Perfect way to end this supernova of a Genesis album.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|I haven't quite listened to every Dream Theater album yet (still haven't heard Falling Into Infinity) but I can surely say that this may very well be the best of their works.  In fact, the title track is worth the price of admission. I'll go into it song-by-song of how great it is. <br /> <br />1. The Root of All Evil - 10/10 - The newest in a series of songs about the 12 steps in the Alcoholics Anonymous program. Genious main riff, awesome solos, and great lyrics. One of the highlights here. <br /> <br />2. The Answer Lies Within - 9/10 - It gets a bit cheesy about 2/3 of the way through when he sings \\"...You're gonna shi-i-i-i-ine!\\" Otherwise, it's a fairly well-written song. <br /> <br />3. These Walls - 10/10 - I always find myself singing along to this song. Catchy, but prog. <br /> <br />4. I Walk Beside You -10/10- I don't care how commercial it is, a great song is a great song. I applaud it. <br /> <br />5. Panic Attack -10/10- Another big highlight for me. Heavy, with a sweet shred solo from Petrucci. This one recalls Train of Thought. <br /> <br />6. Never Enough -8/10- It's grown a bit stale, but it's still pretty good. A bit weaker of a song. <br /> <br />7. Sacrificed Sons -9/10- Had lots of potential, and even though it's a good song, it could've been a bit better. <br /> <br />8. Octavarium -[off the charts]- AMAZING. The Continuum noodling is cool in the beginning, then we get Medicate Me, which holds you in suspense for what's to come ahead. The keyboard solo is too fast for me to air-key to, and that's pretty remarkable. Then, it goes into Full Circle (which mentions GENESIS!), a little instrumental, then Intervals, which ends in an emotional burst of \\"TRAPPED INSIDE THIS OCTAVARIUM!\\" and it couldn't be sang any better. Then, the beautiful Razor's Edge comes. This is always the part that gives me chills down my spine. It's just amazing. <br /> <br />Overall: The first 7 tracks are pretty good separately, but they're way better when listened to together. The last track is just mind-blowing and I don't understand how you couldn't like it. This is close in the running with Scenes from a Memory as my favorite Dream Theater album. GREAT FOR DREAM THEATER BEGINNERS! This is what I started with and now I'm addicted. Awesome album. I always come back to it. 10/10
B000ION23A|5.0|I thought that I had already seen the best of the 13--that's right 13--CGI animated movies of 2006 when I saw Ice Age 2: The Meltdown. The Ant Bully is right on par with Ice Age 2 if not a bit more enjoyable.<br /><br />The story is one of friendship and setting your moral priorities in the correct order. It's a nice family film with the all important adult-asides. But nothing too grown up that kids would pick up on.<br /><br />The picture is just awesome; this computer generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.<br /><br />The voice-cast is terrific. I went into The Ant Bully without reading in advance who did the voices, and I'm glad that I did; it made it more fun. I'm about to say who did the voices so if you don't want that spoiled skip to my next paragraph. Ya ready? Okay...What a surprise to see in the rolling credits that Julia Roberts was Hova. I wasn't sure, but I thought throughout that Zoc was Tom Hanks (who was actually a producer for The Ant Bully); I was wrong. Zoc was indeed Nicholas Cage. And perhaps my biggest surprise was that Fugax wasn't Tom Arnold...it was Bruce Campbell! (If you don't know who Bruce is, let's just say he's the star of a famous Sam Raimi [Spiderman] directed, cult, not-for-kids flick on my Amazon Listmania List of \\"15 Flicks Guaranteed To Leave A Permanent Impression\\".)<br /><br />Another cool trivia tidbit from The Ant Bully: Listen to the sound played in the background as Zoc marches towards Lucas' bedroom to deliver the diabolical potion. Did you recognize that sound? If not, you're too young or I'm too old. It was the sound that the ants made when in attack mode in 1954's classic giant ant attack movie (starring James Whitmore) THEM!<br /><br />Oh yes, and the last bit of trivia...the 13 CGI movies of 2006: Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, The Ant Bully, Hoodwinked, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away.<br /><br />But the overkill of computer animation in 2006 should not sway anyone into missing The Ant Bully; it is #1 or #2 of all 13 with the other top runner being Ice Age 2. Shame on Warner Brothers for not marketing this excellent children's book turned animated feature film better.<br /><br />Add it to your cart.not sway anyone into missing The Ant Bully; it is #1 or #2 of all 13 with the other top runner being Ice Age 2.

B000JJS8TM|4.0|Well, lets face it. The Beatles are the greatest band ever.  And, without question this is the best fidelity release we have ever been privileged to receive of their music.  But, the truth is that DVD-A is a far inferior format to SACD, and this release, and any future 5.1 re-issues Apple plans to release should really be put on SACD.   This is music clearly deserving of the best possible playback, and SACD is it, particularly on projects originally recorded on analogue tape.  With all that said, while I generally hate remix type projects that detract from the original songs written by the artist, this DVD-A disc is absolutely incredible, mainly because of the clarity of the sound, from tracks that have never sounded as good.  Lets face it, the English CD releases are really pretty bad sounding -  much worse than the LPs.  The Beatles, of all groups, deserve better, and I hope that all the parties involved can finally figure out that there is going to be a huge demand for high resolution 5.1 recordings of the entire Beatles catalog.  I'll purchase the entire catalog again, as will many others. <br /> <br />Lastly, the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because Amazon says 5 is \\"the best\\" and frankly I know that if this were on SACD it would be much better than DVD-A.  Otherwise it is a 5.  If you are any kind of Beatles fan, and have a 5.1 home theater system, you owe it to yourself to buy this disc today and share it with anyone who loves the Beatles.  Its that good.
1400076943|5.0|This book is a wonderfully crafted piece of fiction that pulls the reader in immediately.  Set in modern day Africa we are brought into the very private and abusive family life of Kambili, her brother Jaja, and their parents, Eugene and Beatrice.  Eugene is the product of colonialism and the Catholic missionaries having come into Africa, and it is within his own family that the circle of abuse continues.  The story is told from the view point of his daughter Kambili who is neither bitter nor angry, but is merely a timid young adolescent trying to understand her place in this world.  Themes are beautifully interwoven thoughout this masterpiece.  Color is a constant thread and often the harbinger of things to come, and the hibiscus are also used in similar manner.  If you are looking for a worth while piece of fiction this is it, and if you are looking for something more you have come to the right place, since I feel this book appeals both to the scholar and the casual reader.  I was unable to put the book down once I got started and would recommend it to anyone.

B00000331V|5.0|In the history of the J Geils Band, \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" is their definitive live work. This record came as their Atlantic years were ending. No one knew but soon the EMI America years would start and the fame of the band would be achieved but, at the time of \\"Blow Your Face Out\\", Geils was still struggling to become the great success they later attained. So, we can look at \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" as their summing up of their struggling years and showing the road warrior mentality and experience that all those years can provide on a record. <br /> <br />It's full of their old material and captures their well known knack as a live band. As someone who saw the band in  that era, this live record is as close as it gets to having been at a show in the 70's. <br /> <br />\\"Monkey Island\\" was their final studio record for Atlantic but, in reality, \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" was their real swan song to their past at that point and shows a glimpse of the greatness that was to soon come at EMI America. <br /> <br />Buy the record. You'll love it.

0393327655|1.0|I have made a career of being critical of religion, and have published a good deal on religious violence. So, at first, I greeted this book with interest as something that might have been consequential. Instead, the author never goes beyond being a naive juvenile rant. The scholarship is practically non-existent, nothing new is said, but what is said reaks of prestentiousness.One measure of the shallowness of this book is that the author never makes any distinctions among kinds of religion. I think I threw the book in the trash.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|When I first heard the CD was being made I thought ok this just another Beatle 1 or Anthology which I found boring and stall since I own all the original albums on CD and some on vinyl as well. After reading the story behind the Album, I took a change and bought it. All I can say is \\"Wow what an album\\" then I let my mother listen to it who has been into the Beatles since day 1 and she was blown away and wants a copy for Christmas.  <br /> <br />I have read a lot of the reviews here and find that some people are not judging the music fairly.  You may dislike Jackson, Yoko and even Paul but I don't think this really is something needs to be discussed when reviewing an Album. In the case of realties I really don't think that's the reason they did this, because Michael is the only one needing money and with all the pirated copy out there none of then will make that much. Get over it.  <br /> <br />As for releasing it just before the holidays that the way it's been since the beginning and that the way it always will be. Leave it at that!  <br /> <br />For the people who say they could have made this with a computer and mp3s, I would love to see you try it way harder then it looks. Even if you could, your copy will never sound be as good as using masters like George Martin did.  <br /> <br />And finally for the Tool who said he is would rather have them re-master the catalog them this, all I have to say is get a life. If you are like me and own all the studio albums from 87 releases, you will most likely not re-buy all the albums again. Even if you do buy all of the re-mastered you better have a $5000 speaker system or you will never really hear the difference.  <br /> <br />I think you all should be happy with anything that sounds fresh and new because this is the only way it will even happen again.  <br />
B000J3EEBY|5.0|The last decade has been the poorer for the lack of a new album by the only female singer I enjoy.  Her return is worthy beyond the reach of mere others: the songs meaningful and haunting, the production as nearly flawless as mere mortals may hope to achieve.<br /><br />Were I to make any comment that might be construed as less-than-enthusiastic, I'd comment that the ambience of this album is very like \\"Book of Secrets\\"--though that is no flaw.  Admittedly I might have been ever-so-slightly-better-pleased to hear a groundbreaking new sound; but--Hey!--after what she's been through, could any other artist accomplish as much in a return?  I very much doubt it.  Most artists become moribund by a second or third album.  Christmas, somehow lacking in the three years since the final installment of Lord of the Rings, once again has something new and fresh to remind me of the renewal that is the hallmark of Christmas.  Thank You, Ms. McKennitt!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Strip, double over, augment, splice, jumble, slow down, speed up, morph, blend, spike. Make us feel like solicitors of whores, and make us like it. We'll buy anything and everything. George Martin and Son have shown us that there is virtually nothing you could do to this music that would devalue it for us. Its authority is that mystical. Its boundaries are that flimsy. It seems like it can withstand anything.  I guess what they've done is psychadelize what we already know. They've made it all one song, essentially, 80 minutes of nonstop sound. Songs transition into others by way of other songs. Older songs provide the background for newer ones, and vice versa. It works. I thought it was strange they didn't find the analogue between \\"Because\\" and \\"I Want You\\" and blend the two, but both songs are represented in other ways. Most of the material, naturally, is from the post-Help! era, with the exception of \\"Help!\\", \\"What You're Doing\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\". Oh, and the opening chord of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", which blends gorgeously into Ringo's drum solo from \\"The End\\".   A real standout is \\"Strawberry Fields\\". It starts with John's early takes, then grows step by step... instruments added, vocals added, until it takes its ultimate shape, and then the final mad procession marches along, and brings with it seamlessly interwoven echoes of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Hello Goodbye\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", and \\"Piggies\\".  The Indian theme is dealt with accordingly. Ringo's hypnotizing drums from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" provide the backbeat for George's \\"Within You Without You\\"... and then sends its Sonic Seagulls to merge with \\"Lucy in the Sky...\\" Ringo gets his day in the sun, as he begins \\"Octopus's Garden\\" against the lush strings of \\"Good Night.\\" George, too, is well represented, both Indian-wise and otherwise. Indeed, one of the wonders of this project is how all four voices are melded.  Some songs are left alone for us to appreciate them in surround sound for the first time. For the most part, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"I Am the Walrus\\", \\"Something\\", \\"Mr. Kite\\", \\"Lucy in the Sky\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", \\"Come Together\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"A Day in the Life\\", \\"Hey Jude\\", and \\"All You Need is Love\\" are intact, minus a verse here and there. It's a wonderful disc.  As a side-note: I remember everybody referring to Oasis years ago as the second coming of the Beatles. Real perceptive. Now the only time we hear from those clowns is when they have something ugly to say about their quasi-progenitors. The Beatles had ten years, and they gave us a cosmos. Oasis has had ten years, and have graciously given us nothing.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|When you first listen to these tracks, you may probably think \\"Well, I spend another 14 bucks on songs that I have heard so many times before.\\"  But after repeatedly listening to the tracks, you also may start to notice little differences.  For instance, did Martin fuse the electric keyboard in the Anthology version of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" to the vocal track in the original version?  That track, despite a recent Newsweek article on it, is different then the original.  Or, is the track \\"Gnik Nus\\" \\"Sun King\\" done backwards?  One of the highlights is Martin's version of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\" With this version of \\"Strawberry\\" Martin starts out with Lennon's haunting vocals originally made for a demo track, and then melds effortlessly into another Anthology 2 track while ending with a more enthused and revealed orchestral accompaniment.  Although on some songs the differences between the original and these are barely perceptibly, \\"A Day in the Life\\" is still remarkably triumphant.  It is no wonder that Leonard Bernstein once said of \\"A Day in the Life\\" that \\"three bars still sustain me, rejuvenate me, inflame my sense and sensibility.\\"  This re-mix album should proudly stand beside the current Beatles catalog.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was in my early twenties. It has touched my life ever since and I always think of this movie as one of the best movies ever made.  Not because of some big movie budget but because it is about everything in life that makes all of us strive to be good people.  A true classic that revolves around God, kindness and the the way everyone of us should strive to live our lives.  I will wach this movie during the holidays as much as 10 or 20 times.  I often wish that I could have friends like George and that I could touch as many people's lives as he did.  It is a pleasure to watch as he discovers his Life really is wonderful.
0060574216|4.0|Gray's short book, first published in 1992, is now considered a modern classic.  It is thought of as the first in a long series of books focused on the theory that men and women respond differently to things.  This, in and of itself, is nothing new, but the way in which Gray presents it is very persuasive and compelling.  Since the 70's, with \\"I'm OK...You're OK\\" the self-help movement has had its ebbs and flows.  Now, with the baby boomer's offspring starting to have their own offspring, self-help books, DVD's and other media are ubiquitous.  Gray's book started this second wave in the assault of self-help literature.<br /><br />When this book first came into print, the last throes of the counterculture movement where coming to an end with the Anita Hill hearings.  What those hearings revealed was the fact that in a professional setting, men and women's natural differences must be respected in the new age of sexual harassment laws.  Gray's book provided a good antidote to this new world where the sexes struggled to keep up with their now consistently fluid gender roles, in not only the workplace, but also the domestic front.<br /><br />Although not groundbreaking, much in this book is very persuasive.  Gray writes that women have an understandably genetic tendency to mother their spouses.  This in turn makes a man feel emasculated.  Gray writes \\"although a man may appreciate caring and assistance sometimes, too much of it will lessen his confidence or turn him off.\\"  Gray's simple advice is to stop mothering.  In the same way, men have a genetic tendency to go into their `cave' to work out a difficult problem, leaving their spouse turned off, and feeling unappreciated.  Again, Gray's simple advice is to just let the men work out their own problems and in time, they will be back.  One of the highlights in Gray's analysis is pointing out the fact that men are constantly trying to fix things.  Not fix things around the house, but instead to offer a best practical solution to a matter that a woman is talking about.  Gray contends that when women talk about a problem, they are not asking for solutions.  Instead they are asking for just someone to empathize with what they are saying.  When a man resists this impulse to put on his \\"Mr. Fix-It Hat,\\" Gray contends, and I agree, that a much more polite conversation then ensues.  Overall, while his theories on gender differences are not groundbreaking, they do need to be mentioned to men and women who may not have necessarily have grown up with a good relationship.cal solution to a matter that a woman is talking about.

But the Zappa I've heard, I like a lot. Here he divides his time between sarcastic pieces of social commentary (Hungry Freaks, Daddy; Who are the Brian Police?; You're Probably Wondering Why I'm Here; Trouble Every Day) and hilarious love song parodies (I Ain't Got No Heart; Go Cry on Somebody Else's Shoulder; Motherly Love; Anyway the Wind Blows; How Could I Be Such a Fool?) and he pulls it off either way. Oh, and the twenty-minute sound collage that ends the disc is bizarre, but it's also friggin' hilarious and so ahead of its time, it's jaw-dropping.

079073639X|1.0|This movie is bad and it's the kind of bad that makes movie fans ask, \\"What in the world went wrong?\\"  You start with a Michael Crichton novel, add Barry Levinson, a cast featuring Sam Jackson, Sharon Stone, Peter Coyote and, yes, Dustin Hoffman...and you end up with an inexplicably bad product. The special effect look expensive...and bad.  The plot starts off ok, if somewhat formulaic and then just falls apart. Dustin Hoffman's performance, even, is laughable...something that just is never said of Dustin Hoffman. There just HAS to be a fascinating backstory to what went wrong and if someone would film the backstory, THAT would be a good movie, I'd bet.

And Christmas - who amongst us does not have special memories of this time of year.  And so the combination of the two for me is perfect.  His rendition of \\"Blue\\" is alone worth buying this CD. His version of \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" is very special indeed. For me the weakest song is the duet with Natalie Cole (\\"Baby it's cold outside\\") - too coy for me, I'm afraid. I always play Sinatra's Christmas album at this time of year but now  there is real competition with this album.  Buy with confidence, as they say. You will not be disappointed.

Lord, how John would have loved this creative effort (please, please no more \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums - these are \\"The Beatles\\" for god's sake).  \\"Love\\" forces you to realize beyond a shadow of a doubt that the real \\"5th\\" Beatle was (and still is) Sir George Martin.  If you are over 50 years old, if you really do remember Beatlemania (you didn't get the fever second hand through the Anthology cds), it's ok to go out and buy this album - you have my word it's not another Walmart Greatest Hits (ie., \\"1\\") production.  Brothers and sisters, when you hear the original cut of Strawberry Fields and you get those goose bumps because you know this is our John at his original best - don't blame me if you get a lump in your throat.  Peace.
B000J4OYRW|5.0|Quite simply, THE definitive documentary spaning the Pet Shop Boys 20 plus year career.  This DVD consists of interviews of the boys, both individually and together, footage of perfomances from throughout their career, and some celebrity and music insider commentary on various aspects concerning the PSB. Of particular interest is how gragarious Chris Lowe is during his individual interview, but how he retreats to his more stoic, silent personality when he joins Neil for the interview. Also addressed, the decline of the Pet Shop Boys career in the United States.  The music industry is held to account for not playing their records (which is true) because of the sudden surge in popularity of grunge rock  (thanks to Nirvana). Also held responsible is the American music buying public, who are not known for being the most tolerant of people \\"who don't fit in, who follow their instincts and are told they sin\\".  Their loss.  No other band or group has ever been able to make me feel as many different emotions while listening to their  music as the PSB (and sometimes many emotions within the same song). The Pet Shop Boys are a duo who have been consistently underrated, but maybe not so much anymore.  As time goes on, more and more people realize the depth of their songwriting, the poignance of their lyrics, and their innate ability to consistently supply great and addictive pop \\"hooks\\". This DVD examines the PSB's career in an honest, sometimes critical, but mostly complimentary way.  And why not? They deserve it!  Highly recommmended and a must have for any Pet Shop Boys fan (and playable in US DVD players by the way).
B000IU3Y3W|5.0|From opening note to last, their isn't a weak spot on this album.  Crazy Horse settles into an instant groove, and Young's guitar is dead on throughout.  It's really tough to point to any specific highlights of this album because it's all great; a real treat for guitar lovers.  With reference to the attacks on Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown and Wonderin' they're both good songs, and their inclusion on this set shouldn't surprise or dissapoint anyone who knows that Neil Young is about more than delivering already familiar hits to his fans.
1400049628|5.0|I have read mutliple uneducated reviews that set forth the idea that this is some sort of \\"comedy.\\" What most fail to realize, is that Max Brooks has successfully thwarted the non-believers attempts to reject this book. Since it is \\"funny,\\" your average non-believer will be more tempted to pick up this book and read it to its conclusion, while the educated who know better will pick it up to better educate themselves to survive the imminent Zombie Apocolypse.<br /><br />In either case, believer or not, Max Brooks foray into the survival guide genre is a resounding success. There are a few rough spots in the pacing, but when your life is on the line these moments can be forgiven. This non-fiction book also provides the foundation for surviving any level of zombie encounter. Further, this foundation of knowledge and preparedness works to make the reader better capable of countering any number of disasters, whether that be simple floods or earthquakes, terrorist attacks, or our other looming threat the imminent Chinese Communist Invasion.<br /><br />For similar education material (though, unfortunately, without the Zombie focus), I would suggest the non-fiction documentary \\"Red Dawn.\\"
B000J3EEBY|4.0|It's compelling and exciting to encounter that singular artist with a distinctive and deft sound that merits being deemed a sensibility. McKennit retains that distinction, demonstrating again on `An Ancient Muse' a remarkably comfortable, intimate feel for her quite unique aesthetic, which yields a blend of sounds from where the boundaries about the Middle East, Africa and Europe become less distinct, anchored by a Celtic base. On the best parts of this album, it seems exercised like a rapturous instinct, an ear for turns of melody and rhythm so naturally keen that her creative spirit might well have emerged - an almost corporeal force pulling the bow across the violin or playing the Turkish clarinet. It's a muse that hasn't aged all that seamlessly: After the breathtaking inspiration of `The Book Of Secrets', a certain thinning becomes evident. But, as characterised by the plaintive moan, as of the hollow drone of a wind, that sounds occasionally through these nine songs, it stays restlessly peripatetic, and shows little sign of antiquating.  <br /> <br />This is perhaps McKennit's leanest and most consistent album since `Elemental', and, in spite of the lengthiness of a few tracks, counts as a comfortably stimulating listen, especially when considered alongside other efforts dominated by epic compositions, such as `Dante's Prayer' and `Night Ride Across The Caucasus' on `The Book Of Secrets', and `The Two Trees' on `The Mask And Mirror'. The production has taken a small step towards a tone more spare, hence very little here is reminiscent of the lush intoxication of, say, `The Mystic's Dream' or `Marco Polo'. Occasionally, a song feels like it might have benefited from fuller instruments and stronger beats - `Kecharitomene' falls short of being this album's `Marco Polo' as a result, just like `The Gates Of Istanbul' doesn't quite arrest with an invigorating enough groove. What catches one's attention as a result, however, are the songs strengthened by the paring down; and `The English Ladye And The Knight' stands out, probably her best setting of poetry to music because nothing burdens the pace of the ballad, unlike `The Lady Of Shalott' with its real dampener of a meter that her soaring vocals seem to labour through, allowing her lovely melody to lightly permeate the world sketched by Sir Walter Scott's words like a forlorn lament.  <br /> <br />Not all the ballads fare as well, however. `Penelope's Song' is unremarkable, in that nothing aside from the lyric distinguishes its particular inspiration: A fairly pedestrian melody driven by piano goes hardly any way toward specifically identifying, let alone depicting, a certain perspective, of a certain female character with a certain experience. Likewise, `Never-ending Road', similarly composed, plays like a quotidian, almost cursory, postscript reassuring the willing listener of future exploits of the like. That they're so unmemorable, however, is precisely why they do not hamper your enjoyment of the album's other, better parts. <br /> <br />More exacting and discerning listeners might charge McKennit with self-plagiarism here, more than that which was committed, inadvertently or otherwise, on earlier recordings. This listener, at least, would rather credit her with effective, discreet echoes on this album, knowing glances back at the earlier days of her cultural odyssey as if in appreciation of the knowledge she acquired from them, occurring frequently enough to make some of these songs personal paeans of nostalgia. Listen closely to `Kecharitomene' and strains from `Between The Shadows' become detectable; indeed even a resemblance in form shows itself like a spectre, subtly nodding to journeys past, a perspective on which has been renewed with time, in the light of experience accumulated since. `Beneath A Phrygian Sky' seems to call out across the years to `The Bonny Swans', seeking some timeless realm where they might commingle and share their respective stories. They possess one common undesirable trait, that of the inexplicable use of a jarring, jangling electric guitar that has never been rewarding. Indeed, this mini-narrative, of McKennit's itinerant persona being gripped by a vision of conflict conjured by a zephyr, a transient gasp from the depths of history, begins unpromisingly with crackling metallic strings exacerbating a tenuous, limp, dated-sounding synthesised beat. Patience is tested slightly before a more organic beat is layered on, buoying a sombre melody that envelops simply telling lyrics. There is a mild thrill on hearing the intriguing and, at least sensibly, helpful tip of the hat to `The Bonny Swans' in the form of the latter's familiar guitar chords, nicely accenting the progression from one verse to the next. <br /> <br />McKennit's signature delights are, thankfully, still to be found: `Caravanserai', though unsurprising, and slightly repetitious-sounding for want of a stronger melody, is evocative enough, especially in its rich instrumentation, to send the sand up before your eyes; and, following the quite stirring `Incantation', the opening beats and twangs of `The Gates Of Istanbul' wash over you with the heady, rousing warmth of revisiting an old friend, a reintroduction to the glory of McKennit's craft that brings a smile of familiarity to the avid listener's face. The aforementioned hollow drone is well placed in tracks like `Caravanserai', reminding the listener and the narrator of how it restively lusts after drama in history, that there is turmoil and impetuosity outside the straightforward, reassuring affirmativeness of songs such as this. It may not be as impressive as incorporating that thematic idea of the turbulence and implacability of the past into the composition itself, but the aural embellishment certainly serves its purpose. <br /> <br />This is a most pleasing record that should bear repeated listens; and those being introduced to McKennit's music by way of it may be afforded something to look forward to in the discovery of her earlier, better work, which they will likely be prompted to. Fortunately, this muse has not gathered dust on the travelogue shelf.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|Jump straight to track 5 and use that to adjust your settings. Keep the treble low (you'll see why when you reach track 15). When you're ready to sit back and listen, start with track 9, and you will enjoy a wonderful experience. Believe me, if you let track 2 play on your first run-through, it may ruin the entire thing for you. Giles Martin is no Elliot Scheiner/Brian May/Mickey Hart when it comes to surround audio. His peaks are too high and many songs near the beginning have WAY too much treble.  <br />Enjoy
B00005AREQ|1.0|First the BAD news. <br />Though Max Middleton's keyboards are serviceable, the Fender Rhodes/electric piano sound tends to date this record; hence four, not five, stars.  <br /> <br />If you can deal with that, you can proceed to the GOOD news which is that Jeff Beck is a blues guitarist of the first order, and since the blues is the music that morphed into jazz, one can hear in this LP the willingness to explore and take risks that characterizes jazz players. <br /> <br />Nobody--neither contemporaries like Clapton or Page, nor descendants (of which there are tons of pretenders), play like him, and by that I mean, nobody seems quite as willing to push the envelope. He is as ballsy as they come. <br /> <br />Moreover, while guys like Ritchie Blackmore (a personal favorite) tend to be classified as poster boys for the Fender Stratocaster, no other guitarist has gotten more out of this make and model than Beck. <br /> <br />This is a good starting point for the listener who wants to find Beck beginning to venture on his own, with other players who embraced his vision of where improvisational guitar music of the 70s could go. He has his own unique voice and never compromises. For that, in this age of looped and sampled, corporate and manufactured computer tones, is something for which we may all be grateful.

B000BNX3B4|4.0|Surprised at the lack luster reviews for this charmer.  It was predictable-- so what!  Aren't most romantic comedies?  The dialogue was fresh and intellegent.  The acting was fine.

B000AP04L0|5.0|Office Space highlights the absurdities of the modern day workplace, and the high tech workplace specifically. Everyone at computer software company \\"Initech\\" hates their jobs, especially Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who feels trapped in a treadmill of nonrewarding monotonous work as he rewrites and tests other people's software to insure it is Y2K compliant. Simultaneously, he feels equally trapped in a relationship with a woman who treats him like an unsatisfactory employee. Peter represents all of the 25-35 year old white collar workers who know they are not doing what they want to with their lives but simply find initiating a complete career change as too scary, as if anything could be worse than what they are putting up with already.<br /><br />I'm positive that someone involved with this movie has a deep understanding of working in software, because I easily recognized each of the various types of people represented in the cast - even the psychotic coworker, Milton, who keeps coming to work when they move his desk to the basement and stop paying him. Gary Cole's performance of Bill Lundburg hits the bullseye as the boss that understates in a calm voice everything that he wants, but then has no problem firing people if they don't meet his understated demands. What seems like a post-it note is actually a subpoena, in Lundburg's eyes. One of my favorite scenes is when he is having everyone come in and basically beg for their jobs by justifying their positions. One older worker only seems to have one function - to carry the requirements from the requirements writers to the software engineers. When the bosses try to probe more deeply into his skills he gets angry and bellows \\"Are you blind! Can't you people see I have valuable people skills!\\".<br /><br />Ultimately, Peter and his coworkers bungle a scheme to embezzle from the company by writing a program that extracts fractions of pennies per iteration. Instead of producing many very small checks, the program winds up producing one huge check that is bound to attract attention. Thus Peter goes to Initech to return the check. His return of the money coincides with psychotic coworker Milton finally making good on his mumblings of \\"burn down the building\\". The end result is that, with no Initech to return to, Peter takes a job in construction and realizes he enjoys working outside and with his hands and is thus finally happy in his work. As for Milton, in spite of being without a paycheck for weeks, he seems to mysteriously have found the money to have taken up residence in a tropical resort.g one huge check that is bound to attract attention.

B000GYI32M|4.0|Though the OC season three isn't as good as the first two seasons, it isn't terrible. The third season made a good transition from the second season. Sure, there were some bumps along the way, and the writing is not as good as before, but the OC is still a great show. The good news is, the fourth season is better than this season, the storylines revolve minimally around Marissa since she's no longer in the show. New faces have come to stay in the fourth season, mainly Taylor, Kaitlin, and a small appearance by Volchok. If you like the first three seasons of the OC, don't forget to watch the OC at Thursday 9/8 central on FOX.
B00008973Q|3.0|Ran, by Akira Kurosawa, is indeed a masterwork but I feel some scenes were overly dramatized and therefore am not a huge fan of the direction on this film.  In this film, an elderly Samurai lord, Hidetora Ichimonji, passes the lordship to his three sons asking only in return that he be welcomed in their castles and allowed to live out the rest of his days.  His three sons, Jiro, Taro, and Saburo have differences in opinion.  Mainly Saburo thinks that Hidetora's decision is partly due to him becoming senile and therefore doesn't agree.  As a result Saburo is banished and the two other brothers unite to conquer and attempt to kill Hidetora by cornering him into a tower in hopes that he will commit seppuku or ritualistic suicide.  However, Hidetora escapes and later joins back up with Saburo, who forgives him.  In an epic battle, Saburo joins forces with another ally to defeat the united forces of Jiro and Taro.   <br /> <br />While very lengthy with what I felt as sometimes too much of a focus on drama, this film is very authentic in that it presents the true nature of the samurai in feudal japan.  This film is so full of subtleties about the samurai culture that are neglected in other samurai films.  In comparison to movies like The Last Samurai or others, this film is as authentic as it gets.  From shaved eyebrows and elaborate male hairdoes to kimono attire, this film captures it all and isn't lacking when it comes to maintaining accuracy in depicting the samurai world.  I really found it interesting and unique how the director used the different colors to denote which army was which.  Also the irony in a samurai lord who is forced to seek help from a boy who he had ordered to be blined with a hot iron cannot be ignored neither can the comparision when Hidetora and the jester are roaming aimlessly, without hope or home, in the ash fields to being lost and alone in damnation.  In sum, while I found Ran to be very intersting and useful in depicting the actual culture and way of life of the Tokugawa era samurai (the samurai in this film were using rifles which were adapted and traded from the dutch and other western merchants during the last last days of the Tokugawa rulers), I felt that quite often scenes were drawn out sometimes repeated when not necessary to the plot.  This is a very intersting move, but I feel that sometimes a drama/epic movie can risk being flawed by over dramatizing certain parts that don't necessarily need it, drawing out scenes that could take seconds to get the point across into several minutes. <br /> <br />    If you prefer drama combined with epic or are really looking to take a glimpse into the life of samurai in the last days of feudal Japan, then this is the film for you.
B000002HRE|3.0|That's the best way I can describe this album.  Ever since the Black Album, Metallica switched gears, playing grunge music with more intelligent lyrics than bands such as Nirvana. <br /> <br />Really, how you like this album hinges on your expectation.  If you expect a thrash album akin to Kill 'Em All, then you'll hate it.  If you expect something on the border between melody and thrash like the Black Album, you might warm up to it after several listens.  If you're a Nirvana fan, this might be beyond your comprehension... <br /> <br />The lyrics are rather dumbed down from the gem that was ...And Justice For All.  Instead of \\"Back in the womb it's much too real,\\" a metaphor for being on life support, we get, \\"Give me fuel give me fire give me that which I desire.\\"  The most intelligent song on this album is Low Man's Lyric, which is kind of sad because the lyrics are trite (you would expect Blayze Bayley to sing this instead of Hetfield). <br /> <br />Luckily, music stores are only to be happy to be rid of this travesty, and the chances of finding it used are quite high.  So, if you are a completist, or you're tired of music that makes you think, then this album is okay.  I use it for background music, kind of like the Quake II soundtrack. <br /> <br />Or, you can go out and get Metal Black by Venom, because that's the closest thing to thrash that has been released recently.  Gone is the day of thrash and intelligent lyrics, unfortunately.  But oh well.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|<br />If you wish to embark upon a journey of pure Christmas magic, please DON'T believe a word of the few negative reviews of this movie posted here. Instead, BELIEVE in the plethora of glowingly positive reviews here, and rush to order this DVD (preferably the wide-screen version if you can find it)! This movie is a sheer joy and a true classic for the whole family! I discovered this film as a 36-year-old, when my beloved mom and I watched it on TV together a few years after it came out. We both adored it from the start! <br /> <br />Everyone in the family will delight in the first 45 minutes of the film, which re-tell the legend of St. Nicholas and how Santa Claus came to be. David Huddleston and Judy Cornwell, the actors who play Santa and Mrs. Claus, respectively, are the total embodiment of the warm, wonderful Santa and Mrs. Claus of my heart and imagination! The depictions of the far-away, wintry North Pole--the elves with their various personalities, the amazing toy factory, the magical flying reindeer, and everything else--are the stuff of my eternal-inner-child dreams! <br /> <br />The film then moves from the times of legend to the present. Two subplots that eventually intertwine constitute the rest of the film: a rather touching story involving a starving, homeless boy and the well-to-do little girl who helps and befriends him, and the other subplot, involving a renegade elf (played by Dudley Moore) and a comically villainous toy mogul (played by John Lithgow), who wants to exploit him. While all is told in a way that youngsters will find truly entertaining, older children and adults will also find meaningful (but not preachy) observations on everything from the crass commercialism that has seemingly overwhelmed Christmas (at least in the U.S.A.), to the decline of workmanship and quality, to the true meaning of charity, compassion, and kindness--and yes, even forgiveness. <br /> <br />In short, it's a winner, and I predict you and yours will enjoy thismovie together as a family tradition-of-the-season for years and years to come!

B00004RF9B|5.0|A little dated in some respects, this is a MUST-SEE film.  The Shakespearean plot and the psychological subplot have far greater depth of content than most of what studios churn out today, and the Krell matte paintings are iconic.  While it lacks the seamless realism of CGI imagery, little of what's being put out know approaches its matte paintings for artistic quality.
0761944524|5.0|Andy Field rocks!  He has done the seemingly impossible: written a thorough, logical book on statistics that is not only understandable but entertaining. I'm a PhD student and this is one of the best books on my book shelf - I use it constantly. And - I crack up every time I think about 'Mahlanobis thinking of his distances' and 'Kolmogorov wishing he had a Smirnov'..... <br /> <br />If only more scientific and technical writers could write and teach like Andy Field!!!
B000JVT09C|5.0|Aside from the fact that this movie is very well done, the underlying message and philosophy Superman represents is very inspiring. I'm glad that it kept true to the original superman comics and films while bringing a fresh new perspective. Not sure if anyone cares, but superman's story in this film has a lot of parallel with teachings in Christianity in a universal nature of God.  <br /> <br />The only technical annoyance that I have about this movie is that it's shown in widescreen aspect ratio instead of taking advantage of the entire HD screen (like anamorphic DVDs). I prefer to have high-def content shown on every pixel on my 3k dollar TV, makes worth the investment. Other than that the extra features are worthwhile as well.
B0000507R2|1.0|The music N Merchant plays is beautiful! But that I knew before I bought this DVD-Audio. <br /> <br />The sound is dull, not transparent or detailed nor portrays a wide image. To make matters worse, the 5.1 mix adds nothing to the listening. Most of the mix is geared at the front central speaker. Shame on the engineer who called this an audiophile recording!
B000J103N4|5.0|Catergorically one of the greatest records out of rock, and the very best of all the various CSNY efforts, this remarkable work has been incredibly remastered and restored to deliver a sense of awe. From the smeary beginnings of \\"Music Is Love\\" through the haunting paean to Christine Hinton ,\\"I thought there was somebody there...\\" this is every bit the revolution in recording that DARK SIDE OF THE MOON & SGT PEPPER were, and in many respects, for its organic fundamentals, perhaps an even greater accomplishment. The story is well told by Stephen Barncard in the accomapnying DVD interview. He was an assistant engineer on DEJA VU, who took this opportunity, at first reluctantly, to an entirely new level, one not entirely imagined even by the protean creative genius that is Crosby. It's in the small details that make this so amazing: the blurring and phlanging of source tapes that were sonically dirty into epic western tales, the layering of polyphonic vocals that pre-date the lofty and profound works of Part, the little found sounds of setting up a recording on the fly, as it were, to capture every possible sound - a concept only Miles Davis was using at that point. In fact the collaboration between Barncard and Crosby is very much akin to the sympatico between Miles and Teo Macero. And it is just as amazing in what has been produced. <br />As a guitar album, it also vindicates Crosby's understated talents. Almost every note, chord and lick on this disc is by Crosby. Garcia and Lesh added pedal steel and bass, Kreutzman drums, and Joni, Slick, Nash and Young notable vocals, but all of these contributors were on a cameo basis. The main tracks all the way through were Crosby. The writing is sophisticated, the vocals incredibly powerful, and the sheer \\"sound\\" of the recording revolutionary, especially for rock. This is a high water mark in every respect. <br />I would encourage you to pick up the DVD audio version of this release. In 5.1, as well as in the cleaned up stereo remastering, this is stunning, jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring. It wouldn't be so were the material not the measure of the task, but since it is, this is honestly one of the CDs I hope survives for generations into the future. <br />And the great thing, Crosby was just getting started.... <br />
B000002AGY|4.0|This CD has the reputation of being Jim Hall's best.  Since it's my first Jim Hall CD, I can't speak to that.  It is, however, a very good CD.  The style is mainstream jazz.  Though it came out during jazz's \\"dark ages\\" (1975), this CD with a few small sound quality adjustments could have been released anytime between 1960 through 2006.  Jim Hall's guitar playing is tasteful and virtuoso.  The centerpiece of the album is \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\" which is opens recognizably like Miles' version, but the next 18 minutes go in a different, jazzier direction.  The five gentlemen playing with Jim Hall all do a top-notch job.  Despite age and stylistic differences, they mesh superbly.  A very good CD.

0618551050|1.0|I can not claim that I have read all existing popular science books, but I think I have read enough to say that most popular science books try to spark interest in the writer's field of research from people outside the scientific community by explaining that field of research in a language that laymen can understand. In contrary, Lee Smolin tried to spark people's interest in loop quantum gravity, by bad-mouthing string theory. Reading other reader's reviews, he might have been succesful to some degree. Nevertheless, I believe that there are other people, such as myself, who because of Lee Smolin's approach become skeptical of loop quantum gravity. <br /> <br />If loop quantum gravity is truly more promising than string theory, then I do not see the necessity of giving string theory a bad rap. Lee Smolin could have explained the problem of joining general relativity and quantum mechanics under one theory, and then explain how loop quantum gravity could solve that problem, without pointing fingers on competing ideas in that research field. Lee Smolin's effort to make string theory and string theorists look bad tells me that deep inside Lee Smolin himself does not think that loop quantum gravity is a better approach to quantum gravity than string theory.

In fact, I loved Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole.  However, I was disappointed by this one, it started out alright, but then went horribly wrong. In the beginning I loved the Roman angle and the statue of Rose mystery.  What I did not like was the last half, it was poorly written.  As through the author did not understand about time paradoxes and yet was still trying to write about it. I still gave it three stars only because a day reading about a Doctor Who adventure is always better then not reading about a Doctor Who adventure.  I would read this one when you have finished with the others and there is nothing left to read.
B000007RYQ|5.0|I am a Mahler fan - and I don't like jazz! So I was rather nervous at listening to this first time around. But I found it simply stunning. The resurrection symphony slow movement, complete with screeching solo violin emulating a searingly distorted electric guitar was, in fact, profoundly moving. And the sheer musicianship of the performers, in the more sensitive sections earned my utmost respect. This album is shocking, unbearable, gripping, lighthearted, exciting, mocking, reverential, tender - everything Mahler was. Fantastic buy!
0670038040|5.0|Rumpole of the Old Bailey is so inseparable from Leo McKern, in my mind, that I hear and see McKern whenever I pick up a Rumpole novel.<br /><br />This latest novel is every bit as enjoyable as its predecessors. John Mortimer writes so effectively that a series of complex events and relationships can be described, dissected, deliberated and decided in less than 200 pages.  Brevity can be a virtue.<br /><br />Long may Rumpole continue to appear for the defence!<br /><br />Rumpole fans will enjoy this, and so should other readers of well-written, entertaining fiction.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
0375714669|4.0|Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return, by Marjane Satrapi, is Satrapi's second installment of her graphic novel autobiography.  After reading it (can the experience of a graphic novel be adequately described as \\"reading\\"?), I felt that it was an important and vital addition to the first Persepolis installment.  In Persepolis 2, Satrapi is sent to Austria for an Ayatollah-free education.  She meets people unlike herself, and unlike the other Iranians she knew.  She thought she was a free-thinking liberal, but that was in the context of Iranian culture, not European.<br /><br />I think this book needs to be read after Persepolis 1.  There is a boxed set, and the novels should be circulated together.<br /><br />The detail in 2 is much greater than in 1.  I would guess this is related to the richer memories of adolescence and adulthood.  Satrapi is very open and blunt about her vulnerabilities and transgressions.<br /><br />I feel that I need to read a Persepolis 3.  That is not a bad result for any author!
B00005JPCA|5.0|I recall that many a naysayer ranted and raved when Michael Keaton was hired to play Batman/Bruce Wayne in the first of the big-budgeted exploits of the Dark Knight. How could the actor, known to moviegoers as \\"Beetlejuice,\\" possibly get away with playing the legendary superhero? However, Keaton excelled in the role and even returned in the first sequel.<br /><br />Well, the same crowd was probably upset with the hiring of Daniel Craig as the new 007. The guy is blond and more than likely is the shortest actor to assay the role. And Craig had never carried a film on his name alone.<br /><br />After seeing the film, I can attest that Craig should have no problems with being a headliner now. His interpretation of the role has brought life to a franchise that was becomingly increasingly far-fetched and somewhat boring. Pierce Bronson, Craig's immediate predecessor, had done well in the part but he was saddled with two good films (\\"Goldeneye\\" and \\"The World is Not Enough\\") and two mediocre ones (\\"Tomorrow Never Dies,\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\").<br /><br />It was, indeed, time for a \\"changing of the guard.\\"<br /><br />Craig's Bond is a combination of virility and vulnerability. He is appropriately strong yet shows weakness, especially when his superego gets the best of him. One can't imagine Connery ever losing a card game, as does Craig in this film.<br /><br />Craig obviously worked hard to buff himself up for the part, physically and mentally. His confident swagger as he enters a room is enough to make all heads turn.<br /><br />As far as the film is concerned, there are two extremely exciting chases: an unbelievable (and quite long) romp through a Madagascar city, filled with a jaw-dropping fight above on a construction crane and a fast-paced race along the runways of Miami International Airport.<br /><br />The stuntmen really earned their respective paychecks for both of these.<br /><br />Kudos must be given to director Martin Campbell for keeping the two-hour-plus film moving at a brisk pace.  And the screenplay co-authored by Robert Wade, Paul Haggis, and Neal Purvis brings new life to a character that has been around since the early days of \\"The Cold War,\\" to borrow a line delivered by one of the key players.<br /><br />There is homage to earlier Bonds, direct and subtle. Craig wins a somewhat familiar '64 Aston Martin in a card game. And at the climactic game between LaChiffre (Mads Mikkelson) and Bond, there is an extremely large African-American player at the table. One might wonder if his presence is a tribute to the late Orson Welles who played LaChiffre in the earlier Woody Allen/David Niven Bond spoof.<br /><br />Even David Arnold, the composer of music for each of the Brosnan Bond films, seems to have intentionally constructed a score eerily similar to the classic ones composed by John Barry.<br /><br />As far as the other performers are concerned, Dame Judi Dench is again authoritative and impressive as \\"M,\\" while Eva Green is captivating as \\"Vesper Lind,\\" Bond's associate and eventual conquest. Hopefully, Jeffery Wright will be better used in the next film for his part is no more than a glorified cameo.<br /><br />This Bond is the film of which all its successors will be measured and Craig is, undeniably, the best actor to inhabit the role since Connery's departure.<br /><br />And I hate to say that 'cause I'm a big fan of Roger Moore!!!Robert Wade, Paul Haggis, and Neal Purvis brings new life to a character that has been around since the early days of \\"The Cold War,\\" to borrow a line delivered by one of the key players.

B00000IQW3|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time as a child and continue to find it captivating and entertaining.  The special effects don't hold up and the the story is kind of silly, but it is a fun movie.  It is not a complex dark sci-fi, but almost a fairy tale in space.  If you watched it as a child I'm sure you'll still see the magic.  If you have kids this would make a great family movie.  If you just like light 80s movies like War Games and Starman you'll probably enjoy this movie too.  It is definatly worth the time.

They sang well and when they sang you listened carefully because their music and their message were invariably important. This CD proves it.<br /><br />The CD starts off with the classic \\"Mrs. Robinson;\\" this song was featured in the 1968 movie entitled The Graduate. The musical arrangement is very well done and their ability to harmonize to perfection makes this song a classic. The CD then switches gears for the slower paced love ballad \\"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her.\\"<br /><br />Other classic songs on this CD include \\"The Boxer;\\" \\"The Sound Of Silence;\\" \\"Scarborough Fair/Canticle;\\" the song \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" with its opulent orchestral musical arrangement; \\"America\\" and a very rockin' song entitled \\"Cecilia.\\" \\"Cecilia\\" is a strong song; it offers an upbeat melody that does not match the story of frustration a man feels about his girlfriend. Nevertheless, this song shines and it is a fine choice to end the album.<br /><br />\\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" deserves special note as one of the greatest ballads of all time. I can hardly think of another song that is so soothing. The singer promises comfort, unconditional love and support to his partner whenever it is necessary. It boasts a grand musical arrangement and Simon and Garfunkel perform this song with such sensitivity that you won't easily forget it.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent and the pictures of Simon and Garfunkel are nicely done. Art's choirboy voice actually has a fairly good range to it and Paul Simon's voice is strong and vibrant.<br /><br />One reviewer comments that they didn't care for the applause at the end of two songs. There are live tracks on this album. \\"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her,\\" \\"The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)\\" and \\"Homeward Bound\\" are live tracks. In addition, \\"Kathy's Song\\" has applause at the beginning of the song but not at the end--was the ending applause edited out of this track? It's a small point, however, as the quality of their work never diminishes because of the sporadic applause on this CD. I personally like the way they chose some live tracks along with some studio tracks for this CD.<br /><br />The liner notes don't offer much; then again, Simon and Garfunkel sing so clearly that you hardly need the lyrics written down for you. A brief essay about their work together would have been helpful but again this is a small point.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD as an excellent single CD retrospective of Simon and Garfunkel's best work when they performed together.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Many left-leaning people like myself were disgusted at the deliberately misleading elements in this film; for example, Michael Moore's cruel and completely slanderous attempt to imagine verbally George W. Bush's thoughts as Bush is informed of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center. Moore suggests that Bush was thinking only of Saudi oil investments. None of us knew what was going on in those early minutes of the terror strike on the Trade Center, as the unthinkable took place. Anyone who has taken an introductory course in Logic learns of the fallacies of making logical assumptions based on innuendo. I was just revolted by Moore's completely immoral, hate-filled screed of a 'film'. Moore also insulted the intelligence of the American people by assuming that they would believe his innuendo-filled comments. And this is where he went wrong: the American people were/are not as stupid as Moore believes them to be, and many people were insulted by Moore's arrogant attitude and assumptions, as he spoke down to them as if they could not think for themselves. And in their disgust at Moore's condescension, and ad hominem portrayal of a man who, whether you liked his policies or not, just happened to have the job of president of the United States at the time of the horrific terror attack, many viewers of this movie quite likely voted FOR George W. Bush, not against him. I truly believe that this shoddy film actually caused more people to vote FOR George W. Bush in November 2004, than against him. Moore's arrogance and carelessness boomeranged on him. If Moore had not made this movie, perhaps G. W. Bush would not have been reelected.   I had somewhat enjoyed Moore's simplistic earlier effort, 'Bowling For Columbine', and was expecting much better than this trashy attempt at money-making through slander-based controversy. I should have known better; Moore is an entertainer, and not an insightful political analyst by any stretch of the imagination. Thank God that many Americans (including left-leaning ones like me) have something called education and/or common sense and can recognize lies and deception like the kind Moore attempts to foist off on the public.   An interesting related read is 'The Trouble with Islam. A Wake-Up Call For Honesty and Change' by Canadian Muslim lesbian author Irshad Manji, who also dismisses Michael Moore.   That Moore's trash won the 'prestigious' Palme D'Or film award in France is only because of the ever-present and fashionable anti-Americanism prevalent in French 'intellectual' circles, and yet another symptom of the cultural malaise that France has experienced in recent years, and about which much has been written.   Note also political commentator Andrew Sullivan's creation of the 'Moore Award', for &#34;divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric&#34;.
B000J10ERO|3.0|I wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the previous Superman Films. <br />I felt that the cast was dull. Perry White, Lex Luther, Jimmy Olsen were supposed to be fun and interesting.  <br />I didn't get that from this movie.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|I was disappointed basically because of all the hype. The \\"film\\" did not meet expectations, nor was it better than the theactrical release. Hoever, I did enjoy viewing it in the manner I enjoy watching alternate/deleted scenes/endings given as special features with other movies. In the end, however, that's all it was for me.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|A very enjoyable solid Dylan offering which has music increasingly sounding like Mr. J.J. Cale.
B000IJ79V6|1.0|Just to be clear, the actual movie I'd rate a 4. It's the idea that this edition is supposed to be \\"special\\" that I'm rating so low. <br /> <br />It seems that the actual movie presented here is the same theatrical version that I bought for $4 back when \\"Superman Returns\\" hit the theaters, instead on the extended version shown on TV back in the 80s. I don't understand why the bonus material is worth an extra $15 more than the movie alone is apparently worth. <br /> <br />If I'm wrong, and it is the extended version, then the packaging is poor for failing to say as much (I would certainly get it if I could be certain it was the extended version I remember.) Based on at least one reviewer here, I'm betting I'm right, though.

0618680004|4.0|this book appeals to the frontal lobes, the logical part of your brain. the author is so dominated by these spheres that he misses the point of religion, spirituality, and community. looking at the apparent world objectively, the scientific method, being open to the results of our experiments, planned or unplanned, has enabled us to move from berry pickers, a life behind a plow to writing books like this one, discussing ideas and more than doubling our life spans. the book is intelligent and well argued. if it had been popular during the inquisition and witch trials, many innocent people would have been spared.   if you like exploring fundamental ideas and don't mind having your most cherished values challenged, you will probably get something from the book. but it's not for the feint of heart. my grandmother, a devoted catholic, probably wouldn't have gotten past the first page. my uncle, a benedictine priest, probably would have enjoyed it thoroughly -- he was open to all kinds of ideas, those that supported and those that weakened his belief system.   emotions are running strong now and we are witnesses to the primal and medieval mindset in many parts of the world. religion and psychotherapy can help begin to probe your emotional truth and cope with the trials of being a human being. this book doesn't treat those parts of life very kindly but to accept differences it can only help to struggle with the ideas in this book. it's a perspective on intellectual truth and it can be scary and lonely -- i'm sure this book is terrifying or irrelevant for many. i found it very liberating in some ways but rather disturbing in others. the popularity of this book is a sign no ideas are sacrosanct in this period we live in and that a counterpoint is needed to extreme irrationality that builds walls between people and breeds intolerance.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|After watching this movie I have become convinced that good movies are a thing of the past. This is a truly ridiculous movie. I'm not talking about subject matter as far themes go. The story is rather unbelievable, and frankly, I just couldn't feel sorry for two men who cheated on their wives, and neglected their children for what, 20 years? Also I found the dialogue and special effects to be quite laughable, the worst example being the fake looking glued on beards used to age the characters.On th e upside, the cinematography and scenery were quite beautiful.  Also, I couldn't understand how this movie was promoted by gay advocates since this movie seems to promote negative stereotypes of gays. I couldn't understand why, if the characters were in such deep \\"love\\", Jake's character cheated on Heath's character with a prostitute in Mexico. I think this movie, as a whole, was unsatisfying, and could have been much better.  I REALLY couldn't understand how this movie was given so many positive reviews and touted so much in the media. Some people loved it. Me, not so much.
B000002L9M|5.0|Throughout the '80s, the times saw Depeche Mode growing as a band. Alan Wilder's inclusion on \\"Construction Time Again\\" turned them from a group to a great group, the next one showing they weren't teeny-bop with somewhat shocking (for the time) tracks like \\"Master and Servant.\\" This may not had any big hits, but that also doesn't really mean it's ungood or esoteric. It is neither of these. It is perceived as DM's foray into goth which went into the next two albums. This can be heard in tracks like \\"Fly on the Windscreen -- Final\\" and \\"Stripped,\\" a sign of the arena-size ambitions of the group. Martin, the song-writer, sings on four of the album's 12 songs, and most of them have some great emotion in them. \\"A Question of Lust\\" is one of the highlights, a brilliant track which shows that DM have a great deal of substance and are more than a fad. I love the musical arrangements; something comes off as aural bliss about tracks like \\"It Doesn't Matter Two\\" and \\"Dressed in Black.\\" While it may be dark, it's not gloom for gloom's sake, and sometimes it can be happy too. For instance, the title track is an admiration of seeing good even in the darkest days, \\"I can feel your warmth and it feels like home,\\" sounds like a good-day sentiment from \\"Here Is the House,\\" and more importantly, there's \\"But Not Tonight.\\" 20 years later, \\"Black Celebration\\" should be viewed of as just as good an album. I kind of would like to hear what a re-mastered version would sound like. A fan favorite and rightfully so.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|Well...I watched it a couple of days ago. I have to give the movie just an \\"ok\\" rating. It really wasn't as good as many made it out to be. I thought that it was pretty predictable. When I saw the woman run by the hop scotch game that was labeled \\"Heaven and hell,\\" I pretty much knew what was going on. <br /> <br />The movie,at least in my opinion, was a bit too long to have had the ending that it did. To me it just sort of drug something out that could have come to a climax about 40 to 50 minutes sooner. The movie had sort of a \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" ending to it...  <br /> <br />I thought that the overall cinematography of the movie was decent. Although, a bit too dark in some spots and it seemed as though the producer was having camera problems at times. If you pay attention, the video will become dark and then all of a sudden brighten up in certain spots.  <br /> <br />Given the end to the movie,I think it's pretty safe to assume that there will be no sequel to this one. That,in all honesty, is fine by me because I wasn't that crazy about this one. Like I said, it was \\"ok.\\"
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I'm going to get one thing clear: While this may be a double album, it is not really that shocking of a release. It is also not my favorite RHCP album, as I like \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and \\"By the Way\\" considerably more. That being said, some of the moments on here are amazing, like \\"Desecration Smile\\" and \\"Hard to Concentrate,\\" the former showing that they can make the perfect pop song and the latter showing they've still got the funk in them. I don't actually get how people who didn't like the last two albums would jump over this release, but if you're okay with this sort of thing, it's totally fine. It's a little bit overlong for me and plenty tracks ring to me as just average, but it's worth checking out and not too bad of a double-album price.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|\\"Thank you for smoking\\" is an easy to digest \\"Black comedy\\"(I use the term loosely) that seems to use precise as a snipers shot methods at minorly offending traditional PC norms.  Although those methods are often the bits that keep the story moving along.  It should only really offend those who are extra sensative about being politically correct, or who are stuck in a pre 1995 pop culture mindset(so any politican).<br /><br />The story itself is rather predictable, but I think its meant to be, and thats whats comforting about it.  The pace of the story keeps good, and the way the film is shot vaguely reminds me of much of the cinematography of Fight Club, which is a good thing.  As far as comedy's go lately this has been one of the few of late that hasn't made me feel brain dead due to endless frat boy humor.  The comedy is sharp enough to keep the attention of your more jaded movie goer, but not so sharp that the previously mentioned frat boy would be left out in the cold.  Also the narration in the movie is a nice touch, I believe this movie comes out of a novel, so i'm not suprised at the amount of narration given.  My favorate moment of the film is when he explains that when he flys on company buisness, that if he can convince one person to start smoking, he has paid for his tickets round trip.  Once again..very \\"fight club\\"-esque in its dark humor nature.<br /><br />Check it out, this is one that people will be discussing for quite awhile.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Man, it's mind-blowing how good Tool has gotten with the past few albums. The \\"Opiate\\" EP was decent, but on \\"Undertow\\" there came improvement and the next two albums proved the band was at amazing things. Those records deserved each bit of success that they got. I don't know if I'd recommend this thing to someone who didn't like \\"Lateralus,\\" but for everyone else: This release is just as strong as the past two. Each song on here is wonderful, even the interludes being nice enough on here. \\"Lost Keys\\" is beautiful in the music, even if I don't particularly care for the patient/doctor dialogue to be honest. The second half of this album shows growth in the band, with interesting percussion through \\"Right in Two\\" and possibly their trippiest track yet with \\"Intension,\\" which is quieter without feeling forced. Another growth is in the single \\"The Pot.\\" When I first heard that, I thought, \\"Who's that singing in the intro?\\" On top of that, the whole album shows that Tool's musicianship has not died down from the years. \\"Wings for Marie (Pt. 1)\\" and \\"10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2)\\" are an amazing piece together, showing a maturity and emotion through the track. True, people won't all enjoy Tool, but they're all simply missing out. Those of us who do, let's enjoy what they're indulging in the music.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I just watched it tonight and I notice something new every time!  It's a great holiday tradition!
B000000WZ4|4.0|This album seems like an album people both love and hate. For me, I am closer to the love side, but then again, it's DM, and some of these tracks make the album more than worth owning. Martin sometimes sings on some of the weaker tracks, but not on this album. His two tracks are some of the strongest on the album. The only thing that brings the album down a little bit is that the instrumentals don't really do much, even the closing (unlisted) \\"Junior Painkiller.\\" It has my favorite DM song, \\"Freestate,\\" which has this kind of worldly and trippy feel, and shows a great maturity of the band. I think I prefer \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\", but as it stands, those are my two favorite DM albums (but I also like a few others more). While it may not have the kind of lively energy that made everything from \\"Black Celebration\\" to \\"Songs\\" great, it works perfectly fine on this record. Some mourn the loss of Alan, but for me, this group never put anything bad, and while I feel he is what turned DM into a great band, I wouldn't disregard everything else in particular. Totally worth a listen.
B00003BDXG|1.0|I'm not opposed to watching a violent movie.  I love the Godfather and the Sopranos, The Warriors, and many westerns and assorted other movies (Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, e.g. Dirty Harry) with loads of violence.  I'm also aware that this was a satire, a parody, a statement about the sick obsession with violence, blah, blah, blah.  Bottom line, you either like the movie or you don't and I found it pointless.
B000ION23K|1.0|At what point in man's progress did bratty behavior in children become the standard by which all are measured and parents became bumbling idiots who need aforementioned brats to save them from themselves and their stupidity? Also, when did cartoon movies (semantics aside) come so fast and furious and so maddeningly short on originality? If you want more evidence of the monkey see monkey do dilemma killing Hollywood, I submit:  Madagascar vs. The Wild.<br /><br />Enter this movie. First of all, are there no other insects that behave socially? Was a third movie featuring ants really necessary? Do bees demand more at the negotiating table?<br /><br />As for the brats, the \\"star\\" of this waste of time is a bullied pain in the rear who deserves nothing but the grief he dishes out with such glee and malevolence. He never really apologizes with anything approaching sincerity and the lesson he learns (being a brat isn't always a good idea) is one I think he's should've learned long before. This punk gets beat up by the local thugs, so he then decides he needs to take his pent-up anger out on ants until they shrink him down to size to teach him a lesson. Whatever.<br /><br />The last problem with this garbage is the actors who provide the voices. Some actors have the dynamics to really bring life to cartoons. Nicholas Cage is not one of these actors. I really like Cage's work, but his voice is monotonous, death to voiceover work. Ditto for Julia Roberts. I'm sorry, but if you're not getting folks like Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres, e.g., then you're wasting everybody's time. Even the omnipresent Owen Wilson in this year's best (although still far from the mark) cartoon movie \\"Cars\\" has more vocal range than Cage or Roberts.<br /><br />This is a bad movie with no redeeming message, no heartwarming moments, no comedy, and no creativity. There is only one good bug movie, so do yourself and your family a favor and pull \\"A Bug's Life\\" out of closet and watch it instead.
B000059TEP|5.0|This movie has a little everything that will appeal to just about everyone.  There's plenty of comedy, lots of romance, a bit of action and suspense and a more or less happy, tear-jerker ending.  Not to mention the beauty of a young Demi Moore.  And as a plus, the paranormal aspect gets plausible treatment.  If you haven't seen this, I say you 'must'.  Go out and buy it to watch over and over.
0880793589|5.0|I think everyone should have a pack of this cards because everyone sometimes feels stuck with a problem to the point that he is unaware of other possible solutions.  The ideas in this pack help to look at the perplexing issue from many different perspectives. Sooner or later one may see the light, an open door, most likely many, many doors leading to numerous possible solutions.  These cards are a valuable tool for brainstorming ideas, prompting the person to think of ideas that might have never crossed his mind otherwise.  The wonderful think about coming out with creative ideas is that you also have lots of laughs while you're doing it because you begin to think of wild, whacky and outrageously fun things.

If you thought 'permenant vacation' was bad ('pump' had its moments) this is even worse. It includes 'crazy' another of Tyler's dreary ballads and so bland that Bon Jovi would kill for it, as for the rest it is down the line stadium rock, no passion,none of that Aerosmith intensity that made 'rocks' so great,dumb music for the dumb MTV generation. Lost my custom boys!

B000JJRIO8|1.0|WHY DOES AFENI KEEP EXPLOITING HER SON'S MUSIC. SHE OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT PAC WAS REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT HIS MUSIC. SUBSTITUTING THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL AND PUTTING FAKE ARTISTS ON THE SONGS BRINGS THE QUALITY DOWN BIG TIME. I USED TO HAVE THE ALBUM THE PAC AND BIG YOU NEVER HEARD, WHICH HAD THE ORIGINAL VERSI0N OF PAC'S LIFE AND ORIGINAL VERSIONS OF FRIENDS, ALL OUT, HAPPY HOME. THATS THE ALBUM YOU SHOULD BUY. EVEN THOUGH THE QUALITY ON THAT ALBUM WASN'T THE BEST, AT LEAST IT WAS ORIGINAL AND BETTER THAN THE GARBAGE THAT KEEPS GETTING RELEASED.

B00070Q7VO|3.0|I like Michael Buble. He has a nice, pleasant voice and great taste in music. Compared with the noise we've been getting recently from Barry Manilow and Rod Stewart, Buble is a breath of fresh air, and he sings on key. But to those few overly enthusiastic fans who favorably compare Buble with Darin and Sinatra....well, let's just say these folks need to take a valium and pull themselves together. Darin and Sinatra had command of the standards, incredible presence which came out in their singing, and much, much stronger voices than Buble's. BD and FS could hold a note seemingly endlessly without their voices quivering or falling out of key. They also had passion and maturity (despite BD having died so young) that Buble is not close to possessing. My guess is that lots of reviewers are young and not familiar with many of the great singers of jazz and pop standards and, therefore, have few if any points of comparison by which to measure Buble's talent. Again, I like Buble and his takes on songs like \\"Save the Last Dance For Me\\" and \\"Foggy Day\\", but let's be reasonable in our assessments. Buble, like Harry Connick, Jr. and Peter Cincotti, are refreshing presences in pop music because they appreciate great music and attempt to emulate the true masters of yesteryear. But ranking any of them with Bobby Darin and Frank Sinatra is like mentioning Peter Max with Rembrandt and DaVinci in the same breath. For those youngsters who like Buble, good for you! You have great taste. But I suggest you also listen to any of Sinatra's Capital or Reprise albums or Darin's classic albums like \\"Oh, Look At Me Now\\" \\"That's All,\\" or \\"Love Swings.\\" Listen to Bobby sing \\"A Nightengale Sang in Berkeley Square,\\" \\"Try To Remember\\", \\"Artificial Flowers,\\" or \\"Beyond The Sea.\\" Listen to Frank sing \\"Witchcraft,\\" \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams, \\" \\"Night and Day,\\" \\"There Used To Be A Ballpark,\\" etc. I think you'll then understand why legends like Bobby and Frank don't come along quite as often as you mightthink.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Having just watched the Richard Donner version of \\"Superman II\\" twice (once with his commentary with 'Creative Consultant' Tom Mankiewicz), I can say that I prefer the Donner version, over Richard Lester's...but with reservations.<br /><br />Other reviewers point out redundancies, over-long scenes, and character development problems in the Donner version, but these aren't really fair arguments; what you see are the basic scenes, originally shot; Donner, himself, admitted that had he continued on the film, he would have had to do reshoots of several key scenes, and, of course, would have been involved in the editing process (which couldn't be accomplished to the same degree, in the 'restored' edition). The 'turning the world back' resolution was intended for \\"Superman II\\"; when the Salkinds chose not to end the first film with a cliffhanger ending, Donner shot the Lois 'death' scene, and Supes turns back time to save her...so repeating the same resolution in \\"Superman II\\" was simply a case of using the original film conclusion, which Donner would have changed, had he continued with the film.<br /><br />There are plotholes, and leaps of logic; as the film stands, Luthor is apparently in the Fortress of Solitude when Superman destroys it(!); Clark's 'revenge' against the diner bully makes no sense, since, after winding back time, the original confrontation never took place; indeed, the Jor-El 'farewell' scene would have been unnecessary, as well, insomuch as Supes rewound time back to before he lost and regained his powers. And what ever became of Miss Teschmacher?<br /><br />All this having been said, there are moments where I think Richard Lester's lack of understanding of Superman and his Universe makes me stand in Donner's corner; he introduced abilities Supes never had (Saran-wrap symbols...what exactly were they supposed to do?...the 'Kiss of Forgetfulness'...turning Metropolis citizens into comic buffoons, during the climactic brawl...the whole British-accented town sequence, when Zod 'introduces' himself to the world). Other critics have panned Brando's 'Jor-El' in the Donner sequel, praising the Salkinds for dropping him, and increasing Susannah York's involvement, but she seems totally out-of-place as the 'final authority' figure in the Lester version. Maybe he was overpriced, but I think Brando was essential, and the film certainly would have been big enough to offset his paycheck.<br /><br />I think the Donner version has more 'heart', and reverence to Superman, than Lester's broader, more comic 'take'. Even with the abrupt transitions, logic lapses, rough edges, and redundant resolution, a vision of what \\"might have been\\" emerges, and it was a pretty terrific film!'introduces' himself to the world).

B000H7J9RQ|2.0|First of all let me state that I am a big fan of this performance. I had ONE VOICE on Laserdisc and I have it on CD. Barbara Streisand puts on a phenomenal show. But the DVD presentation of ONE VOICE is really terrible. There are only 2 audio soundtracks, Dolby Digital 2.0 and Dolby Digital 5.1. Both of these soundtracks have very poor sound quality, they suffer from severe compression of the data stream. The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is really bad, the whole concert seems to come from the center speaker. Although the Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack is severly compressed and sounds like an MP3, this is the best of the 2 soundtracks that are included on this DVD. The whole concert is only about 90 minutes long, so there is plenty of room on this disc for an uncompressed PCM 2.0 soundtrack as well as a high resolution DTS 24/96 soundtrack. Why Sony even released this disc with the terrible sound that it contains is a mystery. This performance deserves a much nicer audio presentation than this DVD contains. I watched this disc twice and I will never watch this DVD again, the sound is just terrible. I will stick with the Laserdisc.
0553383663|4.0|This tells the story of the most exciting business venture of the past decade, the rise from nowhere of search- engine Google. In 1995 two Stanford doctoral students began to develop the 'search-engine' which would become the homepage of a good share of the world. Their story is told here and a general picture is given of what Google has done and intends to do. Now the number one search- engine of mankind it hopes in the future to put the 'library of the world' at the disposal of every human being on earth. It also hopes to make major contributions to genetic medicine. Its young owners are a dynamic duo who continue to cooperate and build their fast- growing company.<br /><br />Google whose motto is 'Don't be evil' has made certain compromises with its own principle in time, primarily through allowing certain countries most notably China to restrict and censor content. Google also has tried to find a way of profiting from pornography in a not too indecent way. It has not resolved major problems of the 'Internet' including the massive amount of disinformation, hate- literature, and Terror - knowledge disseminated on it.<br /><br />The story is told clearly and well, if not very deeply. There is an appendix of twenty- three tips on how to better navigate Google .

We were all thrilled with its beauty, and came out singing the songs. The only weakness was the storyline but the visuals and the music were so magical they made up for that. Our youngest was enchanted and went into a penguin drawing frenzy for the rest of the weekend. Bravo to the artists, the director, and all who put Happpy Feet together. It is a masterpiece.

B00005JNS0|5.0|I doubted whether a story populated with cars could actually make an interesting movie, but boy was I wrong. Once again, Pixar has come up with a story that is both engaging and meaningful, whose characters are endearing with effects that take animation one more level up. I actually fell in love with the little red racecar named Lightning McQueen. Now, I know guys are supposed to love cars - but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />Lightning is in love with himself. He thinks he doesn't need anyone else, even a pit crew. As the fastest rookie on the circuit, he thinks he's got everything he needs. He three-way ties for first place in the Piston Cup race and has to do a race off in California with the two other fastest cars: ego maniac Chick Hicks and good ol' boy The King. But on the way, he gets lost in the Arizona desert and ends up in a little forgotten town on legendary Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he tears up the pavement on the town's main street and has to serve time repairing it. In the course of events, a little tow truck named Mater befriends him, as do most of the rest of the town, and he discovers there's been something missing from his life that he kind of likes: friends. He's been in such a hurry to be the fastest car on the track that he hasn't taken the time to enjoy, or realize how much he needs, other people - er, cars.<br /><br />It's a great story, and masterfully directed by John Lasseter (Toy Story I & II, A Bug's Life). Owen Wilson's voice is perfect for Lightning, as is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. The writing is superb, and the animation - whew! The Nascar experience is perfectly reproduced with everyone participating as a vehicle - including the audience and announcers. There are even some actual racecar drivers playing themselves as cars, like Darrell Waltrip and Mario Andretti.<br /><br />The Route 66 experience is equally compelling, and actually the best part of the film, in my opinion. The underlying message is that there is something missing in our fast paced lives that if we would just slow down we might recapture. Thus, the metaphor between the race track (as well as the Interstate) and Route 66, which used to be a very scenic, well driven road that represented a more gracious time in our history - a time when friends and family were more important than getting ahead and winning the rat race.<br /><br />It's a great movie and a great DVD - a little slim on the extra features, but still well worth the money. I hope you fall in love with Lightning McQueen as I did.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithast paced lives that if we would just slow down we might recapture.

B00006SFLV|5.0|A loyal fan of MSCL in high school, I still love it at 26. I don't think there's anyone who can't relate to 15-year-old Angela Chase, trying to make her way through the superficialities of high school without losing her mind. As she moons over handsome popular Jordan Catalano, attempts to fend off annoying little sister Danielle or geeky neighbor Brian, Angela's voice-overs simply state out loud what any of us might be thinking in a similar situation. <br /> <br />Angela is also expanding her world through her friendships with gay Rickie and outrageously rebellious Rayanne. Not everyone is what they seem at first, she learns, and everyone has something to teach her. <br />
6305252572|5.0|Eddie Murphy's popularity on NBC's Saturday Night Live led to a film career. The same applied to his predecessors such as Dan Aykroyd,the late John Belushi,the late Gilda Radner,Chevy Chase and Bill Murray. Here is Murphy's starring film debut overall,opposite Nick Nolte about a cop and his apprentice about to apprehend wanted criminals. Plain clothes cop Jack Cates(Nolte) and his apprentice Reggie Hammond(Murphy) are just the right pair for the job. There was a catch:they had only 48 HRS. to do the job. Also Jack has been having disputes with his girlfriend Patti(Annette O'Toole). However,the police job landed Reggie in jail since he was a criminal himself and an escaped convict. Great support from the late Brion James who was Jack's co-worker Sgt. Ben Kehoe. This popular film inspired the 1990 sequel ANOTHER 48 HRS. In between the two films,Murphy starred in other popular favorites such as TRADING PLACES with Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis,BEST DEFENSE with the late Dudley Moore,BEVERLY HILLS COP,THE GOLDEN CHILD,BEVERLY HILLS COP 2,COMING TO AMERICA and HARLEM NIGHTS with the late Richard Pryor. Also in between,Murphy became a recording artist and released an album in 1985 spawning the Top 20 hit PARTY ALL THE TIME. This film and the sequel were directed by Walter Hill and distributed by Paramount Pictures.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game was purchased last Christmas as a \\"family\\" gift, and we still enjoy it a year later.  My boys are 12 and 13, but even younger children would enjoy it.  My husband and I don't mind when this one is pulled out for family game night!  I like that it requires thinking spatially, planning strategy, etc.  I found it in a children's catalog where it was recommended as a top game.  Don't be afraid to buy this one!!  Enjoy!

Yes Ozzy re-recorded the drums and bass (It is not badly done at all) and that is wrong, I agree...But Randy Rhoads guitar sound is FREAKIN AMAZING ON THIS ALBUM VERSION and if you can only get this version don't deny yourself a masterpiece. And FYI I have BOTH versions and this one sounds superior to the unbiased ear.
B0000A12H2|1.0|This movie (shown on TV recently) is without a doubt the most stupid, inane movie I have ever seen.

Why the picnic tables? and on and on and on!!!!
B000J10ER4|5.0|Regardless of what others write about this movie, I loved it and know that my kids will too.  Superman is portrayed much more like his comic book counterpart, an other world alien desiring to live life as a human, but knowing that his tour in this world is larger than his own desire. <br /> <br />Superman is viewed a little darker than the super hero brought to life by Christopher Reeve (a character we all loved) by newcomer Brandon Routh.  The story begins a little awkwardly with Superman's return to Earth after a five year hiatus.  But movie watchers quickly learn why he left and also learn of another secret kept by Lois (Kate Bosworth), presumably from the last of the Reeves portrayals of Superman. <br /> <br />The \\"new\\" Superman's costum is much more like that of the comic book hero; his cape appears to be made of a rubbery type of material giving it a more cartoon-ish look, as well as his boots being \\"squared\\" much like the brogans shown in the DC comics. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will watch again with the same enthusiasm!

B00006AW2F|3.0|I thought that it was, widely, known that Oldham took the tracks that were , mostly, unfinished tracks and brought it to Trod Nossel studios in Wallingford,Ct. and had studio musicians add the final touches [on some tracks a lot more than just 'finishing touches' were added]. Andrew Loog Oldham just wanted to cash in on the \\"gravy train\\" that was \\"The Rolling Stones\\", who had become a machine, only the likes of Col.Tom Parker, could fully appreciate. Not that I feel bad for the Stones. Anybody who has followed them for all these years knows [or to be honest, we can only surmise] that Michael Jagger was not concerned about the quality of this material but that he would not get moneys gathered from sale of said album. Let's face it, Jagger is one of the cheapest bastards on this planet. So when The Stones, actually Jagger, pleaded for fans NOT to buy this album because it wasn't up to Rolling Stones standard,it rings as major league insincerity. Jagger cares about Jagger and $$$$ first and foremost, not the fans. Don't you ever believe different.<br /><br />  I'm not a 'half-empty' guy by any means, I'm usually quite positive about most things in this world, but sometimes you just have to call a spade a spade. Long live Brian Jones!

She is totally captivating as Elisabeth and I became an instant fan of this actress. A great support role also by Benjamin Whitrow as Mr Bennet. A definate one for the collection.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|First let me start by saying, I am a massive fan of the Superman films. Superman The Movie is one of my favorite films and Dick Donner did a brilliant job. Superman II was my favorite of the all the Superman films. I saw it eight times in the theater when I was a kid, wore out a VHS version and bought the DVD as soon as it came out. As much as I loved Superman II, I always thought it had big problems. Some scenes were over-the-top, badly cut, lacked continuity and just plain campy.  <br /> <br />When I heard that the Donner cut was being released, I figured that all the good stuff from the theatrical cut would be married to Donner's vision. How wrong I was. There are so many people reviewing here that say Donner's cut is better. It's not...not by a mile. It's interesting, but it feels like an incomplete, shadow of the theatrical Superman II. Some of the scenes that made Superman II so exciting and gave it emotional weight are now simply gone. <br /> <br />***Spoilers Ahead*** <br /> <br />I knew this cut was in trouble when the entire Eiffel Tower sequence was deleted. This was one of the best parts of the entire film and to see it gone was heartbreaking. Now we have Lois drawing a pair of glasses on a picture of Superman, suddenly realizing Clark is Superman and jumping out the window of the Daily Planet to see if Clark will turn into Superman and save her. It's as campy and ridiculous as anything that was in Lester's cut. As a matter of fact, all the reviews that say the \\"campy\\" dialogue has been removed are incorrect. The stuff between Lex and Miss Teschmacher on their extended visit to the Fortress of Solitude is so over the top it's almost embarassing. Miss Teschmacher using the FoS toilet? Oh, please! It's horrible!!!! <br /> <br />The 80 percent removal of the Niagra Falls setpiece destroys...and I mean destroys...the revelation moment that Clark is Superman. It's replaced by badly lit screen test footage of Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve that was obvioulsy shot a year or two before. Reeve is skinny, has different hair in each cut away and Kidder doesn't even resemble herself as Lois in the film. Then, Lois shoots Superman with a gun...that just happens to be in the hotel desk...and he admits he's Superman? Say what? While the Niagra Falls honeymoon suite was campy and silly in Lester's version, the whole sequence where Clark's hand is burned (or not burned) in the fire and he admits to being Superman is so beautifully done. There was such chemistry between Kidder and Reeve and it's totaly lost here.  <br /> <br />I don't even want to get into the ending. It's such a cop out and has no emotional impact at all. The \\"magic kiss of forgetfullness\\" is gone (which I thought was stupid back in the day), but turning the earth backwards again, the General Zod and Co. being put back in the Phantom Zone so that the whole story never happened? Eeeek!!! Horrible, Horrible, Horrible! Didn't work on \\"Dallas\\", really doesn't work here. <br /> <br />So what does work? Marlon Brando's scenes with Christopher Reeve are a treat. Jor-El comes across as a kind of a bastard and the emotional interplay between Reeve and Brando is top notch. Also, much better is the fight sequence over Metropolis. It's lean, mean and scarier than the Lester version. But that's really all that works. <br /> <br />While I admire Donner, I have to say Lester comes out the winner here. I need to go watch the theatrical cut again just to cleanse my pallet.
0679746323|5.0|Western college graduates are usually aware of Mao's tyranny, including the mass famine in the Great Leap Forward and the killings, imprisonment, and humiliation of innocent people during the so-called Cultural Revolution. <br /> <br />Jung Chang's goal is to demolish Mao's reputation INSIDE China, where all university students are taught about the great leader, Mao Tse Tung. Chinese university students are taught that Mao was a great man who defeated the Japanese Army, won the civil war, and united China. They are also taught that \\"Mao made many mistakes\\", which the west would call crimes. <br /> <br />Since she grew up Mao's China, Professor Jung Chang had the ability to understand Chinese culture (not an easy thing to do), interview Chinese eyewitnesses (who don't readily trust westerners), and comprehend Chinese documents (also not an easy thing to do). For any student of Chinese history, this well-researched book with source notes for every single page is must reading.
B000HKYNQA|4.0|This Amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it. They should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out. Could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and I don't see how to download it again. <br />Update: Most of the problems I experienced were with my Sattelite connection. After 175 MB they start to throttle the speed way down. I upgraded and this helped. I can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours.

B000GFLKF8|5.0|Every once in a while you come across a movie that has you on the edge of your seat for parts of the movie. In the case of Inside Man, don't expect to feel the back of your chair any time between when the bank robbers roll into the lobby and the end credits. Actually you may not even lean back into your seat until long after the credits finish rolling as you sit and try to comprehend what just happened and ponder if you should watch it again. Granted if you listen to the opening soliloquy (the dude even tells you to listen carefully), the ending shouldn't be at all puzzling. <br /> <br />So what we have here is your basic bank heist. Guys (and a girl) go into a bank with guns waving; soon the cops arrive to make sure they get don't get away while making sure none of the hostages are harmed. But you quickly realize this isn't your ordinary game of cops and robbers. On one side you have Denzel Washington (Remember the Titans) as a detective and negotiator assigned to the case. Naturally he has some skeletons in his past namely some money that went missing from his previous case. On the other side of the law is Clive Owen (Closer) as the ringleader of the robbers who give a powerful performance despite spending the majority of the movie behind a mask, sunglasses and hooded sweatshirt. <br /> <br />At the peripheral of the case is Christopher Plummer (Must Love Dogs) who owns the bank yet seems to care less about the money inside the vault than something locked away in a security deposit box. That's where Jodie Foster (Freaky Friday, no not the crappy Lindsay Lohan one, the original) comes in, she's the person you call when you need something done, and done discretely. Almost a character despite never seen on screen is director Spike Lee turns the bank robbery into a bigger issue that also deals with race, class, and sex and is still able to feature his longtime collaborator, New York City itself even though most of the action takes place in the bank and a police trailer. And Spike had plenty to work with thanks to Russell Gewirtz, who throws in plenty of one-liners in between all the tense scenes leaving you laughing only to then wonder if you should have or not considering the overall tone of the movie. The best of which is Owen's dislike for a Grand Theft Auto type video game the youngest hostage is playing.
0714844659|5.0|I noticed the book Breakfast, Lunch, Tea by Rose Carrarini being mentioned in the Lifestyle magazine that came with Sunday The New York Times newspaper.  The idea of little meals caught my eye. Over the years I have handpicked cookbooks into my small collection, but I'm constantly on the market for something that I might like or might not have imagined.  The latter appeared in the form of this book.  I ordered the book, opened it on a random page and - it took my breath away, literally, with its structure, beauty (needless to say - Phaidon press)and a promise of finer things, food included.  I opened it on a back flap, which quoted Rose Carrarini saying \\"Life can be improved by great food.\\"  Oh yes - they are my kind of people!  The Carrarinis prefer and prepare their food simple and natural, preferably, but not necessarily organic.  They put vegetables above meat or fish with ambition to blur the line between home and restaurant cooking; they have put together menus, and based on them, a cookbook that is too filled even to be read in many sittings.  Rather, it is to be enjoyed by tiny morsels that make your lunch, snack or day. A thousand thanks for this masterpiece!
B00000JXVK|5.0|I was so excited to see this movie on DVD! I remember as a kid watching with my dad and humming that familiar tune, I love it. For all you motorcylcle lovers, I don't think I need to tell you that this one is a classic. There is however one problem: I can't find their soundtrack anywhere. If anyone knows who does the music or how I can find it, I would really appreciate it.

B000JVT092|4.0|I was not overly impressed. <br /> <br />With that said, it was a good movie. Maybe the hype I've been hearing since before the movie hit theaters had built it up too much.  <br /> <br />Superman/Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) returns after a five-year search for his home planet. He comes home to find Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) with a kid and a boyfriend living with the two. Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is out of prison and hatching another diabolical plan that would endanger billions of lives. And the man of steel must reintegrate himself into the life of a superhero and a reporter. <br /> <br />I like the direction that Bryan Singer took the movie in though. He modernized it in a way that fits in better with my generation. However, he lost me on the Justice angle. There wasn't much of one, unless it was supposed to be implied. The few bits from Jor-El helped it a little. But not enough.  <br /> <br />He focused most of the film on the Superman/Lois story, which is what many of us wanted to see anyway. Singer portrayed it well, and didn't fall into a Hollywood-love-story-cliché.  <br /> <br />Routh's performance was on. He was the embodiment of Superman. But, Spacey was better. Mostly, because I was never fond Gene Hackman's performance as Lex in the previous films. Bosworth played Lois' character well enough. And I feel a bit sorry for James Marsdon, who played Lois' boyfriend. Singer keeps putting him in these roles where he can't keep his woman. <br /> <br />It is another great story in the Superman saga. Not as great as Christopher Reeve's Superman I & II, but a story worth seeing.  <br /> <br />3.75 Stars
B000I0QK74|5.0|James Taylor's Columbia holiday set is a gorgeous and friendly set that brings the smile of friends and good times to disc.  Chris Botti's trumpet is lovely on the opener \\"Winter Wonderland\\" with James' voice oozing that warm friendliness that makes him sound like he's in YOUR living room singing just for YOU!  James' voice is lovely on the gospel favorite \\"Go Tell It On the Mountain,\\" \\"Shepherds watching over their flocks by night, out of the darkness shown a heavenly light.\\"  \\"Jingle Bells\\" is recast as blues funk track with some tasty lead guitar licks.  The teasing duet with Natalie Cole on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" polishes the lovely melody with their voices playing well off each other.  Joni Mitchell's classic \\"River\\" from her album \\"Blue\\" has now firmly become rooted in the Christmas cannon of modern singers with James' lonesome voice tailor-made (pun intended) for the tune.  \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" is stunningly beautiful with the melody boasting its hopeful cheer and James' voice a dear lament for days gone by.  \\"Some Children See Him\\" with Dave Grusin's piano is beautiful in this sparse musical setting.  \\"Who Comes This Night\\" is a new song penned by producer Dave Grusin that first appeared on James' limited-release Hallmark set.  With my family attending to a loved one who is all too quickly passing this holiday, its lovely message brings tears to our eyes, \\"Who sends this song upon the air to ease the soul that's aching, to still the cry of deep despair & heal the heart that's breaking.\\"  It is simply a lovely melody, superbly sung.  The set ends with a classic version of the great New Year's song \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\"  James Taylor's \\"At Christmas\\" touches the heart in ways only his music could.  Treasure this one!  Enjoy!
B0007R4TAS|5.0|<br />Me and my mum went to see this several times at the pictures when it first came out.  We're from Yorkshire and It captures Yorkshire beautifully as well as the brutality of the times.  I thought both main players were wonderful - not glamorous and true to the book.  (Perhaps it is something to do with the the cleverness of film-makers in the 70s as Wuthering Heights with Timothy Dalton as Heathcliffe is also one of my favourite films).  Music also excellent.  Delighted that it is now out on DVD so we can enjoy all over again.

B0007GAEGC|2.0|I saw these women (and entire ensemble) on PBS and at first it was great.  I was mesmerized by the lights & setting of the show.  However after a while I got extremely bored (I know so many may disagree but if you are honest with yourselves you have to find this true).  Every song starts to run into each other and the girl with the violin comes running out jumping around playing what seems to be a similar solo over and over.  I am a musician, these are great musicians but the way they have done these songs seems...overdone.<br /><br />Now the CD gets even more repetitive.  With PBS at least I was watching things, now with the music it got repetitive after 3 listens instead of 7 like on TV.  I love Celtic & Scottish music and can listen to bagpipes/Harps all day so don't trash my opinion here.  But there are NOT enough dynamics and color to this group.  There are so many other wonderful Celtic musicians I can think of that have so many more colors/dynamics and variety.<br /><br />The dresses were awesome...that is true, but there is more to music besides fluff.  Overall I would not recommend as many albums as they have, it gets real tiresome.  The main theme here is my title...when you have heard 3 songs, you've heard them all.
1400082773|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book because Barack returned to his \\"roots\\" in Africa and reconnected with his father's side of the family. The similarities of life in Africa to life on early St. Croix, Virgin Islands of my youth was profound. I felt transported on the same journey to the earlier years of my life, especially the similarities in people, culture, community, politics, economics, and class structure.  Also, I think that it is an important part of who Barack is if he does make a run for the Presidency.  It helps to identify and position him in the political world of his people, the Democratic Party. <br /> <br />When Barack decided to include his black ancestors it gave him a stronger sense of community and a wider connection to the global community of the world.
B000FVQYYK|3.0|Okay.. I wish I could give them 3 and half stars but I can't. I have all of their released works. I regard the Muse as one of the most original, creative, talented, inspiring bands of my life-time. Their scope and versatility are amazing. I have to say that Black Holes and Revelations is not as good as any of their previous works. Having said that, it is still good, and there are still some great tracks on it. I know that they have always had the odd cover track on their albums, but it is a little worrying that the number seems to be increasing. Whilst their songs that they choose to cover are always superbly done, I feel a bit uncomfortable when the CD does not make clear what is a cover song, and what is original. I think that the boys need to take a break, and re-charge their batteries. Maybe have a few kids, give them a different angle on life. I believe that they are going through a transitional period. I will still buy every future album that they release...
B00005JPCD|3.0|\\"Happy Feet\\" is fun, somewhere between Bambi for penguins and, as many have said, a musical version of \\"March of the Penguins\\" with a social message.<br /><br />What it is not is lasting. The best animated movies, like \\"Aladdin\\" (also starring Robin Williams), \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" \\"Snow White,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Bambi,\\" have more going on than shtick. \\"Happy Feet\\" relies too much on shtick. This makes it entertaining the first time through, and probably not the second.<br /><br />The animation is often much better than \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" The wry humor is as good as, or better than, the best of the Veggie Tales shorts (way better than \\"Jonah: The Veggie tales Movie\\"). The music will make an interesting soundtrack.<br /><br />What's the shtick? A dancing penguin. Great premise, but the animation's timing is weak. The sound of the tapping does not equal what is on screen. The dance routine becomes exactly that, routine. We see it once, twice, three times. The fifteenth time, I was bored with it.<br /><br />The food chain is explained well, as is the competition for food. Penguins, birds, humans, all eat fish. Some birds also eat penguins. When humans eat more fish, birds eat more penguins, and the penguin population naturally declines.<br /><br />When the penguins suffer, they look for solutions. Some ideas are silly, and blame the conservative side of penguins -- very 1950s-style Soviet communism (with a dose of Native American animism and a weaker dose of 1890s Christian revivalism). Others are survivalist, requiring endurance of characters. Mumbles becomes an unwilling solution finder. He is not looking at the big picture, he presses naively through hardship to ask simply if the humans (he thinks they are aliens) can help.<br /><br />Survival of the fittest is clear here. The struggle, the ingenuity and resourcefulness of survival is played well.<br /><br />The music, especially the introductory songs, are great fun. It will appeal mostly to fans of late 1970s and 1980s music. Its brilliance is in the mixing of songs so well that a first time listening might not realizing it is a medley.<br /><br />Williams is better than he has been recently, especially with his Barry White styled guru penguin, Lovelace.<br /><br />Characters are not always well-explained. They come and go, occasionally for no reason. This could be bad writing or editing, but, either way, left me confused.<br /><br />\\"Happy Feet\\" could be considered a movie in which the main character tries to find himself. Or, if the audience wants to think more heavily than intended, Mumbles the dancing penguin is Martin Luther, an artist, an unwilling revolutionary, or a gay activist. It flirts with all of this, but never enough to dominate the message.<br /><br />I saw it once, had fun, should have waited for the DVD. Should you see it? Sure. You too will tap your feet, laugh a little, but it is no great animated movie.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.commixing of songs so well that a first time listening might not realizing it is a medley.

B000JSI7AI|2.0|If Universal is smart, they will delay the release of the \\"SPECIAL COLLECTORS' EDITION\\" until they can add something with more \\"meat\\" to it.  Brokeback Mountain fans are very disappointed.  This is evidenced by the lousy reviews given this edition here at Amazon.  Many of us were hoping for the inclusion of the legendary \\"hippie\\" scene that was deleted from the original release, as well as a director's commentary, and possibly a commentary with Jake and Heath.  Maybe when this \\"special\\" edition doesn't sell, Universal will sit up and take notice.

0880389052|5.0|I remember it so well, I had just finished The Return of the King and a friend recommended the Drizzt series. He let me borrow his copy of Homeland, and I was absorbed by the book. The fast-paced fight sequences, the insight into the politics of the drow, and of course Drizzt. The book amazed me. This book is a great start to a great series and you won't want to put it down! When you eventually have to, you will Immediately want to pick up the next book in the series, Exile.
0743298020|5.0|It's quite a treat when an author can write something new that feels as if it was penned years ago by one of the literary greats she references so frequently, like Bronte or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.'Tale', is a gothic ghost story about a reclusive, blockbuster writer who requests a young biographer to hear the real story of her life, and the dark secrets that are buried in her past. However, along the way, our young biographer has her own secret to contend with, and one that might link her to her dynamic and mysterious employer This was a great read that not only has a plot that that gave no clues or insight as to where it was headed, but also is a love letter to bibliophiles, and their quiet obsession with the printed page.
0060763280|5.0|Easy to read. To benefit you must have an open mind. You must admit that you don't know it all and be willing to change. If you can do this, you can hardly fail to improve your situation and quality of life as well as your net worth. I can't imagine an investment with a higher return. There is no magic here but a lot of common sense. We are all held back by fear and erroneous preconceptions. This book tells how to overcome these obstacles enabling you to percieve the boundless opportunities all around you, whatever your particular situation.
B0000A7W14|5.0|Boyz in the Hood is a movie that evokes strong emotions 15 years after its release. This movie is hard-hitting and obviously very real since it was a brainchild of a man (John Singleton) who grew up in Inglewood, CA (South Central, L.A.) <br /> <br />The other sad reality about this movie is the real life violent end of some of the cast members.  Dedrick Gobert who played the pacifier sucking friend, Dooky, was shot and killed in 1994; Lloyd Avery II, the guy who shot and killed \\"Ricky\\" became a murderer and was killed in prison, and the guy that played \\"Mad Dog\\" is also dead. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to the review.  Yes, there is quite a bit of cussing, but that's real life in the \\"hood\\" so if you can get by that and really look at the deeper mean of the story, you'll do all right. <br /> <br />Anyway, BNTH is an excellent movie depicting the inner city life of childhood friends and how their lives turn out. You will not be disappointed.
0525476881|4.0|After my 14-year-old daughter finished this book and thought it was wonderful, I thought I would see what all the fuss was about.  What I found was a wonderfully well-written and refreshing novel.  It is light-hearted and fun, yet it has some very tender teenage emotions involved.  In order to get over his heartbreak after being dumped by Katherine XIX, Colin attempts to find a theorem to figure out how relationships work and if you can formulate when one person will be dumped by another person.  I found the math rather complex but the story was wonderful.<br /><br />Colin is a loveable nerd who does anagrams all the time and knows endless amounts of trivia as well as useful facts and figures.  He thinks of himself as a \\"has been\\" but I found him adorable.  His character is quirky, as are all the characters in this book, but sincere and very likeable.<br /><br />Hassan, Colin's best friend and sidekick, is one very funny guy.  I found myself laughing out loud and wishing some of my friends were more like Hassan.  Hassan and Colin are a great pair and together along with a girl they meet in Tennessee named Lindsey the book moves rapidly.  In fact, I thought the story started out strong and just kept getting better.<br /><br />Disregard the YA rating for the book, it is a good read no matter what your age.  In fact, I'll be looking for more books by John Green in the future.
B000056OBA|5.0|As one reads the earlier reviews of this Beethoven set, it seems that there are a wide variety of opinions about von Karajan's rendering of this version of the Beethoven symphonies.  For what it is worth, I see three versions at the top of the heap--this one, Toscanini's NBC Symphony version, and Georg Solti's Chicago Symphony series.  Period.<br /><br />Obviously, other versions have their advocates and make their unique contributions, whether Bernstein's, Furtwangler's, Klemperer's, and so on.<br /><br />This version, though, has tension, has a pace that creates excitement, has clarity in the manner in which the various instruments manifest themselves.<br /><br />The 5th is crisply rendered, with a luminous sound.  The 6th is elegaic.  The 7th and 8th are appropriately energetic.  The 9th is one of the best versions of this great work.  Furtwangler had a version, which he conducted during the Second World War, that is chilling in its energy (and its idiosyncracy), unlike other of his versions of Beethoven; Toscanini's 9th is ethereal in its rendering.  Von Karajan's version ranks up there.<br /><br />All in all, this is a \\"must buy\\" if one wants a full set of Beethoven's symphonies.

0671004107|4.0|Science fiction/fantasy written by someone who knows science is refreshing.  Reminds me of Asimov. Or a more accessible Feynman. I mean that it the best way possible. <br /> <br />The book touches on many subjects, including academic egos, technology, religion vs science, science vs government, government vs government.  The book revolves around the means that some totally unthinkable culture might communicate a complex message.  The latter was of course Sagan's passion and was the whole reason for the book. <br /> <br />It also touches on issues such as Your Sneaky Government, sexuality, and sexual bias with a 70's academic slant (not in an in-your-face way however.) <br /> <br />Basically, everything Sagan had to deal with is represented.  He says the characters aren't real. I think he's lying :-D <br /> <br />What happens in the book? Sometime in the mid-to-late 80s, a dedicated, brilliant, and somewhat boring radio-astromomer is Director of a radio astronomy facility.  One of her dishes gets an interesting signal. Of course, things snowball. The novel finishes sometime in the beginning of the new millinium... That's all the spoilers you get! <br /> <br />How did it read? Pretty good. The characters tend to be a very believable mix of pettiness, heroism, strength, brilliance, and quirkiness.  Even the heroine has her share of issues. <br /> <br />Recommended.  While I rated it a 4, it was more of a 3 in a literary sense, but it is a _worthwhile_, thought-provoking book. It made me want more science and didn't give it. Sagan's such a tease.
B000I5X824|2.0|I'm was a Staind fan from the beginning and first of all they left out so much of their great early stuff, instead they only put the radio songs that made them popular, and second off all, greatest hits albums should have 20 songs, and forget covering other bands, no one can cover a great song like the original. Here's my list of the greatest hits, and notice about 95% was left out of the album:<br /><br />1. Open your Eyes  2. Suffocate<br /><br />3. Come Again  4. It's Been Awhile<br /><br />5. Tolerate  6. Yesterday<br /><br />7. Just Go  8. Pressure<br /><br />9. Devil  10. Devil<br /><br />11 Mudshuvel  12. Falling<br /><br />12 Me  13. For You<br /><br />14 Nameless  15.

B000005JU3|4.0|The basic Greatest Hits album from the Rolling Stones was \\"Hot Rocks,\\" a compilation of their greatest hits from 1964-1971.  A fair number of other compilations has been developed over time, but \\"Jump Back\\" is the closest thing to a Hot Rocks II (not counting their \\"Phased Cookies\\" album) that we have.<br /><br />Numbers come from the albums from \\"Exile on Main Street\\" (e.g., \\"Tumbling Dice\\") and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" (e.g., \\"Brown Sugar\\") to \\"Steel Wheels.\\"  The CD shows that the Stones were not as productive as their first decade (in terms of great hits per year), but they were still capable of some pretty strong rock and roll.  Among the rockers that are worthy of the Rolling Stones on this album are: \\"Start Me Up,\\" \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Harlem Shuffle,\\" \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"Miss You,\\" and so on.<br /><br />Needless to say, one could wonder why other songs might not have been included. Other songs strong enough to have been included: \\"Shattered\\" (one of their treasures), \\"Going to a Go Go,\\" and \\"Twenty Flight Rock,\\" among others. Nonetheless, this is a representative selection of top notch rock from the early 1970s on.  Rolling Stones' fans will enjoy this CD.

B000000OU4|5.0|As a HUGE Pat Metheny Group fan, I own about 8 of his CDs and listen to them regularly.  \\"We Live Here\\" is one my favorites...along with \\"Still Life Talking\\" \\"Letter from Home\\" \\"Secret Story\\" and \\"Speaking of Now\\".<br /><br />The group's membership has changed composition over the years, with Pat Metheny (of course) and Lyle Mays the only two core players that have been on every PMG album since their self-titled release in 1978.  Others have come and gone, with some mostly staying (such as drummer Paul Wertico and bassist Steve Rodby).  On this album, we've got those four plus David Blamires (vocals, brass, guitars, and misc others), Mark Ledford (brass, vocals, whistling, mallets, guitars, and misc others), and Luis Conte (percussion).  With 7 guys, it's the largest of the various iterations of the PMG and in contrast to the PMG of early days when it was simply a quartet, these additional members allow the group to achieve sonic textures that simply couldn't be achieved with fewer players...particularly with the multi-talented Ledford and Blamires adding so many little nuances like marimba, flugelhorn, and rhythm guitars.  Their voices blend quite nicely as well, contributing that signature \\"oo ah ee\\" stuff to Pat's signature guitar work.  It's just one of the many things I like about this album.<br /><br />The group also adds some things not heard on other albums such as strategically placed sound effects (thunder and rain, along with an approaching subway train and an electric motor) which again add some interesting texture and complements the music nicely.  It never feels forced or results in a sound that is over-produced and unachievable outside the confines of a studio...as can be witnessed by getting a copy of the DVD by the same title...the group flawlessly replicates on stage what is heard on the album.<br /><br />I particulaly like \\"Red Sky\\" and \\"To The End of the World\\" (my favorite), but every track is good...with none meriting the \\"skip\\" button.  It is a fantastic album when you just want to unwind after a hard day...with a glass of wine and the fire crackling.  I also like to take this album on road trips.  There's nothing quite like winding through the curves of the Pacific Coast surrounded by this music, creation, and a powerful car.<br /><br />While a lot of people within my circle of friends are unfamiliar with Metheny, when I put on one of his albums they invariably say, \\"this is GREAT music...who is that?\\" (including my 70-year old mother).  The music appeals to such a wide range of ages and tastes because in so many ways it defies categorization.  It's jazz, but without falling into the cheezy \\"smooth jazz\\" genre and yet not falling into the traditional jazz category either.  The PMG is a group that has really defined its own sound and carved out a unique niche in the world of jazz.<br /><br />And it's a niche that I love.  I think what I like best about the PMG in general, aside from the beauty of the music and the obvious talent of the musicians (these are guys who take their craft extremely seriously), is that it's just plain interesting music...never boring.  I also like the fact that the group departs occassionally from the 4/4 rut and ventures out into some unusual time signatures, always navigating them effortlessly and grooving them fluently, led by Paul Wertico's amazing abilities...particularly his cymbal work.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this album to PMG lovers and newbies alike.  You won't be disappointed.ou just want to unwind after a hard day...with a glass of wine and the fire crackling.  I also like to take this album on road trips.

B000J10ERO|3.0|Plot Synopsis:<br /><br />The famed man of steel returns to Earth after having been absent for five years in a search for exploded Krypton. Upon his return he finds his old flame, Lois Lane, now has a fianc&eacute;e and a son to boot. Meanwhile, Lex Luther is at it again with plans to build his own continent out of crystals stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. The ritualistic battle between good and evil ensues with Superman eventually coming out on top.<br /><br />This is not a bad movie as some would indicate, but is by no means a great one. There are many pluses and minuses throughout the film. First of all, this, less even than the other films, is not true to the DC comic's character at all. It is a world that the scriptwriter made, not DC comics. Second, the film covered old ground of Kent growing up and confuses us somewhat. Is this supposed to be a sequel or a remake of the original 1978 film? Third, Lex Luther is again portrayed but does not act as the comic version did - besides, why all the infatuation with Luther? The comics Superman had other villains such as Brainiac. I, for one, would like to see some variety here. Fourth, same old tired sequences of Lois and Superman flying together. C'mon screen writers ... the comics Superman had three (count `em, three) girlfriends and was not this hung up on Lois Lane.<br /><br />And by the way, Let's get the Fortress of Solitude right. In the Superman dogma it is a mountain cavern in the far north with a huge key disguised as an airline marker. No crystalline structure at all. It was more like the Batcave in that it housed Superman's trophies, momento's and the shrunken city of Kandor. I hate the bastardization of the comics I loved as a kid. With today's CGI effects, we can duplicate anything we saw in the comics. The phantom zone for instance (it did not look like someone trapped in a plate of glass .. convicts lived in the real world but as an invisable ghost who could not touch or influence it).<br /><br />Yes, there is some positive here. The film is dark - much darker than any of the other previous chapters. The photography is more compelling thanks to advances in technology. Brandon as a choice for casting is a good one in that we don't have to get used to a different looking Superman/Clark Kent - but he's a little more wooden than Chris Reeves was. Kevin Spacey is good as Lex, but as I said, it's time for a new villain.<br /><br />Technically speaking, there is nothing to find fault with the dvd. The visual is crisp and clear, the audio track superb. Lots of extras on the disk itself.<br /><br />&lt;Sigh>  This should have been a better film, but is tired because of all the ground it is retreading. It is confusing in spots and really stretches believability (Superman and Clark disappear for five years, return at the same time and no one makes the connection? Duh!). Same villain. Same plot. Same action. 32 available as new/used by third party vendors in so short a time after the dvd release should give an indication<br /><br />Buy it and enjoy, but don't expect anything really great.<br /><br />~pjm~film is dark - much darker than any of the other previous chapters.

B000J3EEBY|3.0|For some reason this album just didn't move me. Yes, it is ably produced and LM has worked hard to evoke a certain mood, but much to my surprise, I actually yawned through it. I have her previous releases, but this one...it's a soundtrack suited for background music in new age shops and massage parlours used to create a \\"magical\\" atmosphere, but ultimately doesn't reach the heights of before. Either that or there's to much an air of pretension that overrides her good intentions. It will remain in my library - for now.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|-- \\"Love is the same thing that DJs do all the time! The same as amateur Beatles mixes! Just repackaging the songs yet again!\\"     Not at all. This was multiyear project that includes elements from 130 Beatles tracks, remastered and remixed to create an entirely new organism that, as it so happens, sounds fantastic.      -- \\"Once again, they're cashing in on the Beatles catalog!\\"    Um ... what cashing in is this? Sorry, I must have missed the glut of Beatles re-re-issues. The original albums were digitally released in the late 1980s during the early years of CDs, and this release shows that, if anything, the band is waaaay overdue for remastering with today's technology. Unlike, say, Lucas with the Star Wars movies, Apple has been relatively restrained given the popularity of the band. All the posters obsessed with the profit aspect rather than noticing the artistry at work here are saying a lot more about themselves than about the creators of this CD.    -- \\"It's perverting Beatles music!\\"    How is that possible, exactly? As producer George Martin said, \\"no Beatles songs were harmed in the making of this CD.\\" So calm down. The originals are still there.     -- \\"The Beatles songs are perfect just the way they are and any tampering is a terrible idea!\\"    Any artist will tell you, there's no such thing as perfect. Just because you, as a fan, love the previous versions that are wrapped up in your own nostalgia, doesn't make them \\"perfect.\\" In his 1980 Playboy interview, Lennon said that there's not a single Beatles song that he doesn't wish were different some how, some way. That all he hears are the \\"mistakes.\\" So who's to say that \\"fifth Beatle\\" George Martin, now free of having to deal with the egos of four musicians and having better sound technology, won't make some songs better?

B000I2J5UG|5.0|\\"The Black Parade\\" is an album that, in my opinion, demands a lot from the listener. It's interesting to note a lot of reviews posted soon after it came out, in particular those that slagged or dismissed or seemed disappointed by the songs. Just like a fine wine or great work of art, time is a crucial key to gaining both an understanding and appreciation of what is being offered. MCR have crafted a very fine and intricately detailed album that i don't grow tired of listening to.  <br />At first, their choice of track listing (ie: opening with \\"The End\\" amongst others) was a little off-kilter, but, the more I listen, the more I appreciate/understand. Gerard has chosen to present the tracks in the fashion of a dying man's recollections of his life, life flashing before one's eyes. In fact, this reminds me of Grant Morrison's (comic) \\"Invisibles\\" , Vol. 1, issue 12 wherein the story is presented as a series of non-linear scenes that are ultimately revealed to be the dying visions of a token bad-guy who had been killed by King Mob, the main character, back in issue 1. Now given Gerard's professed admiration for Grant Morrison's writing, I'd say it's no mere coincidence, more a case of subliminal inspiration, if not an outright tip of the hat. But I digress..  As for the songs, manoman what a collection. It's hard to pick a fave overall, but \\"House Of Wolves\\", \\"Mama\\" and \\"Sleep\\" stand out especially. \\"Sleep\\" (to me) seems like a natural album closer, but that goes back to the choice of track-listing. Not so much dashing expectations as breaking rules and conventions, which really is brilliant - so much of these songs owe a debt to \\"classic rock\\" forms, but MCR also choose to keep the rig barelling in a post-modern/forward direction, pedal full to the metal. Bravo! <br />MCR really are an inspiration. I'm 33 and these guys (among others) give me hope that good/great music is in safe (new generational) hands, and not in danger of being completely homogenised (ie:IDOL-ised)into putrid stagnation. <br />Also, Liza deserves a special mention. So much bad press about her inclusion on the album. Typical of what Henry Rollins once referred to as \\"hack writers\\". Bravo, Liza! And Bravo MCR (Gerard especially) for such gracious consideration of her. <br />Now, I really only have one tiny criticism of \\"The Black Parade\\" - \\"Cancer\\" is just too short! Call me greedy, but it needed at least another verse or something more. Cool song, but! <br />And the Box Packaging is just exquisite. James Jean rocks as does black velvet. Now, if I can only have MCR agree to headline MY funeral one day, that WOULD be a black PARADE! LOL. <br />Looking forward to seeing MCR live in January and also can't wait 'til their NEXT album (Not to forget THE UMBELLA ACADEMY comic). Peace! <br />Oh, and one last point - \\"John\\" : man I don't know whether to pity you or hold you as an inspiration. I mean, Keith Urban - putting yourself through THAT much torture in the name of musical appreciation, that takes stones! I suggest Celine Dion next or maybe even John Tesh. As for your quip about MCR being the biggest posers, well, I still ain't bought YOUR CD yet (It IS on the wish list, though) so I guess the verdict is still out. LOL.
0446677450|5.0|While \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" isn't meant to somehow transform your situation into the financially free state that most of us strive to be in, it does its job where everyone needs to start: in your own mind. \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" is about getting you into the frame of mind you need to think outside the financial box most of us tend to be trapped in. I found that it helped me think in a more entrepreneurial sense and get me into that mind frame. And as the saying goes \\"You have to think it before you can be it\\", meaning if you plan on being successful, then you first have to have the mindset of being successful. <br /> <br />In Mr. Kiyosaki's book on Investing, he gives you good advice that you have to invest the time in order to find yourself becoming successful. You have to invest in educating yourself on the tools and techniques you have at your disposal. He gives examples like learning how to read financial statements of businesses.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, Mr. Kiyosaki's books alone wont make you into the next Bill Gates or Donald Trump, but it does set you on the right path in my opinion. <br /> <br />-Rugar (Student and eBay Business Owner)
B000002O4X|2.0|John Barry's compositions are pleasantly sweeping. There's nothing wrong with this album, just not really enough to recommend it. <br /> <br />I was puzzled to learn that some time between my buying the LP record and the issuing of this CD, the track \\"The Music of Goodbye (love theme from Out of Africa)\\" was omitted. It's not that this song, sung by Melissa Manchester, is a must-have; it's more that it's sneaky to leave off tracks when you reissue a soundtrack in another format.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I'll begin with stating where I stand as an Incubus fan:  <br /> <br />- Fungus Amongus was a very young but still very talented and impressive album.  I'm a fan of Incubus' funk side.  I don't care if most of the songs are about smoking weed and aliens.  They were 17 or so.  Considering that, it's amazing. <br /> <br />- S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was their best CD in every way shape and form.  Explosive, funky, heavy, beautiful, talented, progressive, and a whole slew of other complimentary adjectives.  Just get it if you haven't already. <br /> <br />Then along comes their transition.  Their Make Yourself album begins what I consider to be a 3-album long transition from S.C.I.E.N.C.E. to Light Grenades.  Instead of sticking with their common heavy funk, they started to grow into something a bit more pop.  That's not horrible always.  It can be done right.  But the transition wasn't always easy to stomach and left me longing for the early days.  Until now.  <br /> <br />Before I get to the \\"now\\", let's talk about the growing pains of this 3-album long transition.  In this period, Incubus schizophrenicly switches from trying to be a funk-metal band, to trying to be a jam-band, to trying to be Red Hot Chili Peppers, but spends the disappointig majority of their time trying to make radio hits.  Some songs embody this kind of painful experimentation.  \\"Miss You\\" on Make Yourself was a growing pain.  On Morning View, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" was what I'd call a growing pain, as were songs like \\"Priceless\\" on A Crow Left of the Murder.  They're either awkward or sickeningly blatant calls to the radio station.  \\"Hey, would you guys play this junk?  Hey thanks for the check.  See you in 2 years with our next single.\\"    <br /> <br />These 3 transition albums have also yeilded utterly amazing songs though.  Namely: \\"Pardon Me\\", \\"Stellar\\", \\"Warning\\", \\"Echo\\", \\"Aqueaus Transmission\\", and on the A Crow Left of the Murder album, some really brilliant work with the self-titled track, and the 3masterpieces right in a row \\"Talk Shows On Mute\\", \\"Beware! Criminal\\", and \\"Sick Sad Little World\\".   <br /> <br />Unlike some of the other reviewers on Amazon, I actually really liked A Crow Left of the Murder.  That album was the last of what I consider their transition albums and came really close to making a full transition into something new and mature.  No longer were we given FANTASTIC funk metal (probably the best you'll ever hear in that bastardized genre), but that's okay, as long as what you present us next will be good as well.  And it took them almost 10 years, but we got that next good thing: Light Grenades. <br /> <br />I preordered Light Grenades and have listened to it about 15 times or so now.  I must say that I am thouroughly impressed.  As I've alluded to, Incubus seemed to have been trying to achieve something unique every time they came out with a new album.  It was never quite successful until now.   <br /> <br />How is it unique?  I'll use what little knowledge of music I have to try and explain.   <br /> <br />Overall, the album has an utterly striking mood.  It's the biggest aspect of the record and the hardest to explain.  The whole album has almost a feeling of urgency and grandeur.  I'm not sure if it's the progressions, melodies, or particular note sets they're using, but something's up.  Something's special about the mood.  Since I could go on for paragraphs trying to explain it, suffice it to say you need to hear it to know what I'm talking about.  <br /> <br />Musically, we're seeing a better balance between a more Prog Rock sound and Pop Rock.  Their 3 transition albums we're an awkward balance between Prog and Pop.  This album allows the two ways of approaching music to compliment each other.  The songs are complex enough to hold a musician's attention yet effective and very, very catchy.  They achieve exceptional musicianship no matter how you look at it.   <br /> <br />As for lyrical content, Brandon's always a genius at how he words things, but we're not given much more than 10 or so different takes on love and relationships.  There ARE a few songs on the album I precieve to be about society and deeper things, but it's a whole lot about love.  That's fine too, I suppose.  It takes a very ecclectic stance on love, at least.  Gone are the days when we get a song about pot, though.  Perhaps a good thing. <br /> <br />Song-to-song analysis: <br />1. Quicksand - Welcome to Light Grenades.  Buckle your seatbelts because this song introduces you to this vivid worldly atomsphere that nearly every song will possess.  It is the BEST \\"intro song\\" I've ever heard.  It is ONLY an intro song, though.  Thus not worth a perfect 10. - 9/10 <br /> <br />2. A Kiss to Send us Off - Don't mind the name, this song rocks!  We start off with some use of strings that were left over from \\"Quicksand\\" that slip ever so perfectly into one very jamming song.  It's a powerful tune that kind of introduces you to the \\"urgency\\" I sense throughout the whole CD.  Listen to what the guitars are doing, especially during the verses.  It's intense, it's anxious, and it plays into their mood. - 10/10  <br /> <br />3. Dig - A bit less intense, a bit ballady, but has a very pretty melody.  The song is kind of cute, actually.  He writes in the lyrics that when his ego grows, the person who has to deal with him should sing this song to him.  \\"We all have a weakness\\" but who he's singing to will \\"act as a clever medicine\\" to reveal the \\"better part of (him)\\".  The music is pretty and the lyrics make me smile. - 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Anna Molly - This song was a very good idea to have it as their first single.  It's what got me to preorder it.  I sensed there was something special going on and my senses were correct.  The sense of urgency continues as we focus on Brandon's obsession with some woman he can only see in his mind's eye.  What an anomaly!  Yes, that was the play on words. - 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Love Hurts - Okay.  So this CDisn't perfect.  This song is why.  The title says it all.  It's pretty enough, I suppose.  But it's a ballad, through and through. - 5/10 <br /> <br />6. Light Grenades - WOW!  Incubus certainly is back!  The interesting thing about this CD is they sound like they've always sounded, they seem to simply utilize the different aspects of themselves and assemble them more coherently.  This song utilizes some of the explosive talent we remember from \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" which was my personal favorite Incubus album.  It's a fast, clever, and lively song.  One of the best on the CD. - 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Earth To Bella Pt.1 - These songs aren't bad.  They continue with the mood on the CD, but the meaning of these songs gets lost on me.  They're beautiful songs, utilizing what sounds like an accordion, and a neat progression on the acoustic guitar.  It's got loud and booming parts too.  An interesting song, but not the best. - 6/10 <br /> <br />8. Oil and Water - Even though the 'Bellas is the only 2-parter song on this CD I think Oil and Water & Dimonds and Coal are 2 parts to the same song.  This song takes a bit of a pessimist view on a relationship and the next takes an optimist view.  This song comes out better than Diamonds and Coal because it feels so big.  It feels like such a big production, especially with whatever piano-like instrument they're using.  Very cool.  Catchy, too. - 8/10 <br /> <br />9. Diamonds and Coal - Kind of a corny song, but fun too.  It's the optimistic version of \\"Oil and Water\\".  This is a guilty pleasure. - 7/10 <br /> <br />10. Rogues - An energetic and hopeful song about revolution and transformation to something better.  This song is 'Progressive' in more than one way if you know what I mean.  It means a lot to me.  Brandon provides the powerful vocals on this song but the band as a whole is almost more important than he is.  Kilmore, Einziger, and Pasillas especially.  The timing is extremely important. - 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Paper Shoes - A very sophisticated melody and I'm not sure but I think Brandon contributes some procussion.  Boy, is this song interesting!  Listen to the weird reverb on the drums, the use of piano, the almost dream-like mood of the song.  Very nice. - 8/10 <br /> <br />12. Pendulous Thread - The album probably should have ended here.  This song is such a high note that it sends chills up and down my spine.  With an anticipatory build-up of cacophony, this song explodes into harmony.  Again, as this whole CD displays, there is a sense of urgency.  This song has it more than any other song.  The bass line is really funky.  There's a maddening guitar solo.  Kilmore seems to be trying to get us to go insane.  This IS the climax of this album.  Amazing, stuff. - 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Earth to Bella Pt. 2 - As song 12 fades out, this one fades in.  I guess it's a pretty punctuation mark, but it is really in no position to be following up \\"Pendulous Thread\\".  There's some interesting stuff going on the 2nd time around, though.  We get an organ instead of acordion and prettier vocalization by Brandon.  I suppose this is the better half of the song but it's \\"meh\\" compared to \\"Pendulous Thread\\".  - 6/10 <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, this is the new Incubus.  They've worked hard at showing us they can successfully transform their band, and I think their work paid off.  The only reason this CD isn't a \\"5\\" is because S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is one of the best CD's ever made.  It will be impossible to ever touch that album.  But honestly, after hearing this album, I'm glad Incubus didn't quit while they were ahead.  Were I in the band, and had I just made S.C.I.E.N.C.E., I might want to cut my losses and get a real job or something.  But ultimately, I'm glad Incubus chose not to.
B000K5LBVC|4.0|This is a very good, well acted movie. The story centers around a general in the Roman legion who is enslaved and becomes a gladiator of reknown, called the Spaniard.<br /><br />The general, Maximus, esteemed by all the legionaires that he commands, is a favorite of the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. The Emporer has a son, Commodus, and a daughter, Lucilla. While Lucilla is clearly the worthier of the two to inherit her father's empire upon his death, she cannot by virtue of her gender. The Emperor knows his son to be unworthy to rule in his stead, as Commodus is totally devoid of character and craven. So, Marcus Aurelius, knowing that his health is failing, tells Maximus of his wish to declare him protector of Rome upon his death, in hopes of returning Rome to the people, as a Republic. Unfortunately, Marcus Aurelius makes the mistake of telling his son the same, thereby bringing about his death at the hands of Commodus.<br /><br />Commodus, now Emporer, extends the olive branch to Maximus who refuses, knowing that something unsavory has happened to Marcus Aurelius, for whom he had great affection. Rebuffed, Commodus has Maximus arrested with an order for his execution, as well as the ravaging of his lands and the slaughter of his wife and small son. Maximus escapes execution, but does not make it home in time to save his family. Captured by slave traders, he is sold and becomes a gladiator known as the Spaniard. This is all I will tell you about the plot. Watch the movie and see for yourself.<br /><br />Suffice to say that Russell Crowe gives a masterful and powerful perfomance as Maximus. Yet, I think Joaquin Phoenix gives an extraordinary performance as the the evil and sinister Commodus. His role is not a majestic, heroic one, but for that reason alone, his performance is, to my mind, the more compelling one, as it is stangely moving. If there are any Oscar recognized performances to be eked out of this film, he should certainly receive strong consideration for best supporting actor. As to the special effects, I was disappointed because, at times, the special effects were noticable; that is, you could occasionally tell when special effects were being employed. It does not necessarily detract from the film; it is just a little jarring to be aware of it.r best supporting actor.

Its a Sci -Fi Thriller set on 25th century earth, and Buck Rogers it is not.<br /><br />Man has colonized the galaxy under the guidance of the UN Protectorate, and The UN has created the Envoys to deal with special problems. Technology has changed the definition of life itself. Peoples consciousnesses can be downloaded in to a cortical stack, so that a person's body is no more part of their being than their car, or home. Something that they make be attached to, but can be changed, upgraded, or even sold. For those with the means death merely becomes a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />Takeshi Kovacs is on the stack doing a 120 year sentence, when he is freighted to Earth via needlecast to go to work for Laurens Bancroft. Bancroft is a meth, a Methuselah, one of the privileged who have extended their lives for centuries. Bancroft had his head, and his stack blown off, the police have ruled it a suicide, Bancroft doesn't buy it. That's why he has brought in Kovacs. The investigation throws Kovacs into the middle of a far reaching conspiracy. He must find a way to solve the puzzle, while saving his skin and those of his friends.<br /><br />Morgan weaves a complex tale of mystery, adventure, and betrayal. His world building isn't extensive, but as the story takes place mostly on the San Francisco, he doesn't need much. He does create a very interesting back story of colonization and the UN Envoys. Characterization is strong. Kovacs is a very memorable complex character, the supporting cast is strong as well.<br /><br />Fans of sci-fi or detective stories should enjoy this book. It evokes comparisons to the work of Phillip K. Dick. I loved this book and highly recommend it. Broken Angels has moved to near the top of my to be read pile.<br /><br />9 out of 10
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|\\"Blowup\\" was the English-language debut of already famous Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni, was a massive success upon it's release, still ends up on lists of Great movies, but is rarely seen by today's audiences. Sad, since this is a great movie. It's great because it leads us into a plot where we think we know what's going to happen, then it doesn't. Not only does IT not happen. Nothing really happens. It deserves comparison to Antonioni's \\"L'Aventurra\\" a movie in which a character disappears, setting up a mystery about what happened to her. Instead, that's it right there. She disappears and is never heard from again. In this movie, a photographer believes he has witnessed a murder and, at one point, even sees the corpse. But did he really witness a murder? Did he even really see a corpse? Is it a dream? This movie actually (something I've never heard anyone mention) seems to be an inspiration to filmmakers like David Lynch; We're presented with images that don't really make sense, but intrigue us nonetheless and don't take away from the story. David Hemmings plays Thomas, a popular London photographer, who spends his days taking photographs of \\"birds\\" who crowd outside wanting to get their pictures taken and, possibly, seduce him. Thomas isn't a particularly likeable guy; He holds an unexplained contempt for women and is rude to people around him. One day, while walking through a park, he spots a woman (Vanessa Redgrave) and a man and begins lurking around taking pictures of them. This scene gives us no hint of what he's going to encounter later. As he takes pictures of this woman and man, the woman spots him and chases after him. She asks Thomas to give her the film, but he declines and leaves. When he gets back to his apartment/studio, she appears. She takes off her shirt, tries to seduce him, he succumbs and gives her the film, and, finally, she leaves...She leaves, of course, with the wrong film and as soon as she's gone...Thomas develops the pictures. After a quick interlude, in which he has a sexual romp with two women who want their pictures take, he returns to the photographs and notices something odd. He blows the photos up, does it again, and then begins to believe he has witnessed a murder. There appears to be a gunman hiding in some bushes, the woman appears to be looking towards him, and finally he appears to have photographed a corpse. The pictures are abstract, but seem clear enough. He returns to the park later that night and sees a corpse...This scene is completely misleading. This isn't a shot where he appears to see a corpse in the distance, to make the audience ask themselves <br />\\"Does he really see it?\\" There's a close-up of the corpse that seems to leave no other conclusion except that there is one. Then we get a haunting scene where he stops his car in front of a club and sees the woman standing there. She turns, takes a couple steps, and is gone. She literally disappears into thin air. By the end of the film, we realize that the murder isn't even the point of the film. Odd since that's exactly what the movie leads us to believe almost to the final shot. And the final shot is a great one. If you've seen a movie by Antonioni (I've seen L'Aventurra and The Passenger), then you know that he's not a director that cuts to the chase. He paces his film very slowly. So slow, some people have called his films dull. This movie is not dull; it's fascinating...Whether you have any idea what's going on or not. It's not an extremely entertaining movie, but I didn't find it dull or boring and I frequently found myself glued to the screen. I'd have to watch the other two again to be sure, but as of now I'd say this is my favorite Antonioni film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-
B000JCXMYU|4.0|I first saw this film when it was released in the mid nineteen seventies. Though somewhat abstract, is pretty terrific, as it is not just a science fiction film with a twist. It is a film that explores themes that are timeless: desolation, alienation (no pun intended), and loneliness. At times, these themes are palpable, due to David Bowie's wondrously androgynous performance, which is heartbreakingly moving at times.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. An alien, Davie Bowie, leaves his family on his dying and arid planet in search for water. He lands on earth and begins his project to send water to his devasted planet by amassing the wealth that he needs to do this. He patents numerous lucrative inventions which eventually find him at the head of a world wide conglomerate. He joins up with a kindly, though stupid and vapid woman who drinks gin like a fish, Candy Clark, with whom he begins a liaison of sorts. Yet, he is always lonely and melancholic, and like her, begins to spiral into an alcoholic haze, sometimes sidetracking him from his purpose here.<br /><br />At some point, excruciatingly sad and lonely, longing for his family, he reveals himself to her for who he truly is, shedding his earthly appearance, only to be met with absolute horror and repugnance by her at the sight of him. She ultimately tries to understand him, but it is truly beyond her ken. He is infinitely sad at this and longs all the more for home.<br /><br />On the threshhold of returning to his planet and loved ones, he is kidnapped by corporate raiders who take over his holdings, and it is here that the movie begins to disintergrate somewhat. Yet, it remains strangely hypnotic and compelling, and becomes a sort of \\"Lost Weekend\\" of betrayal, booze, and promises which will never be kept. A parable of wanting to belong, yet knowing that you truly never will. A story about wanting to go home, but knowing on some level that you truly can never go home again.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Even girls like this movie! I first saw Sergeant York when I was fourteen and I was thoroughly entertained! At first, it starts off a little slow and you may wonder where in the world it's going, but just stay with it because it gets VERY interesting. It's an incredible story! It's also funny to see what a great job the entire cast does playing mountain people. You can tell a lot of research was invested in the movie because it seems so authentic! You would swear the actress playing Alvin's mother was dragged right off a mountain to Hollywood! I still can't believe she's actually an actress!! And Joan Leslie, who plays \\"Gracie,\\" is one of my favorites! She's adorable. And if you listen closely, some of her lines are a scream! \\"I don't know . . . I done a heap of sleep'n while you was away.\\"  I heard someone else remark that what they enjoy about her acting is the innocence and freshness she brings to her character,  unlike modern actresses who lack sparkle and seem like they've \\"been there and done that.\\"  Sergeant York is truly a classic you'll want to watch again and again. I'm only shocked and disappointed they didn't release this in COLOR!!
B00004TH6O|4.0|Though this cd doesn't come very close to matching the quality of their next cd, \\"Songs for the Deaf\\", \\"Rated R\\" is defenetely worth buying if you enjoied SFTD. It is probably their second best out of all of them, including their newest, \\"Lullibies to paralyze\\".
B00003CXB2|5.0|\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is a legendary movie. A biopic, that's about 20 minutes shy of 4 hours long and is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#5). When talked about, most people mention that this movie (to be truly appreciated) must be seen in a movie theatre. Roger Ebert said \\"[It is now] on video, where it crouches inside its box like a tall man in a low room.\\" Watching the film and it's imagery, it's clear that a movie theatre would do the best justice to it...But few people will actually have a chance to see this in the theatre. When the movie came out in 1962, it won a slew of Oscars including Best Picture but was almost lost forever. The original negative's were found in crushed and rusting film cans and have since been restored to what it is now. Hard to believe since the picture in this film looks so good, it could have been filmed last year. The movie stars Peter O'Toole as the title character T.E. Lawrence. I'd heard of O'Toole before seeing this movie, but had never seen him in anything. He's an actor like William Hurt or John Malkovich. He has a very peculiar speech pattern that fascinates you the first time you hear it (and sometimes even the 100th time). The movie opens with Lawrence getting into a motorcycle accident and dying. At his funeral, people discuss him...Saying nice things about him and less-than-nice things about him. But no one truly seems to have known him. The movie flashes back and we learn that Lawrence was a soldier in Cairo, who was sent into the Arabian Desert where he would lead a revolt against the Turks. Despite the fact the movie is, essentially, a biopic...It's not big on plot. There is a plot in the film, but there's not a whole lot to write about on the subject. Along the way, Lawrence befriends Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif, who's terrific) and Prince Feisal (Alec Guiness, barely recognizable). And even Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). Claude Rains (Louie from Casablanca) is also in the film. In my personal opinion, Lawrence ofArabia is, above all, one of the most beautiful films ever made. Its cinematography is almost poetic in the way it pans over the vast desert landscapes. The score of the film is almost ironic. It's an over-the-top heroic score that would seem more suited for a movie like The Mummy Returns. It works here though and makes these scenes even better. The movie is well acted and truly deserves the title of \\"one of the best films ever made.\\" Whether I'd ever watch it again, however, is a different story. If it played at my local multiplex, I'd definitely go...And it's not a reflection on the movie itself that I wouldn't watch it again, merely it's length. It's easier for me to find time to watch 3, 2-hour movies than it is for me to watch 1, 4-hour movie. It's a great movie, though, and one that people should definitely see. If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend renting it first and then making a decision on whether you should purchase it or not. <br /> <br />Grade: A <br />Cinematography: A++ <br />
B00007ELEL|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  I loved hanging out with The Dude for two hours...  Next time I watch, I'm going to make myself a Kahlua and cream.  Jeff Bridges just MAKES this movie.  It's a classic...
B000J10EQU|4.0|I had read many reviews about this film and decided not to see it in the theatres. My mistake. This was a very good film and story line. It may have dragged initially but once it got going it flew(sorry for the pun). There is much action and great special effects. I really liked the plot and how it doesn't try to retell the same story but takes off on the fact we all know who Superman is but he has just been away..<br /><br /> I want to keep this short so let me say I am looking forward to the sequel to this one..The cast by the way is very good including the title role of Superman by a new comer Brandon Routh..I must add there is not a fully wholesome plot that includes a out of wedlock twist..enough said..
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have kept up with John Mayer's music for the past few years, and am so pleased with this album. It's amazing to see the growth between ROOM FOR SQUARES and HEAVIER THINGS, then from there to his live jazz trio album, and now again in CONTINUUM. He's really coming into his own and is now an artist I know I'll be listening to when I'm old and crotchety.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I totally agree with you Carlos. I know this movie won't get any Oscars or Grammys or anything of that sort but who cares. I went an seen the movie twice I thought about a third time but never got back before it was taken out of the theater. I was thoroughly entertained by the movie it took me away from reality for a couple of hours which was nice, granted the cute boys helped out alot there to but that is neither here nor there. Everyone has their own taste in movies so to make your decision soley on what people say on here you may just miss out. I've looked at what people have commented about things I'd considered buying an they may have the worst reviews but I decide why not go an buy it. Then after watching or reading what I decided on buying I enjoyed it and am glad I didn't let the poor reviews sway my decision. So for those of you out there that are on the fence about this movie just go out an rent it. And try to remember that its not an A-List top of the line movie but it does have some pretty sweet graphics and effects. But I'm pretty sure if you rent it an don't like it then it probably isn't the first or last your gonna rent an not like.   <br /> <br />An yes they need to make a 2nd one and of course with the original cast to show the other 3 ascending into their powers. An I have to say my best friend the one in our group that is most critical on movies the one that thought I was crazy on alot of the movies I like, she enjoyed it alot. So when January 2nd comes around I'll definately be buying this movie and makin a space on my dvd shelf for it.
055358202X|4.0|I do not mind really long books. I almost never mind deep dives into minor characters. I love this series, and respect and admire Martin's writing. I really enjoyed the vast majority of this book.<br /><br />All this praise notwithstanding I'm kind of dreading the next installment. I was with him through this book, but I was given serious pause when I realized that the next book would follow the same time frame but then with the Along the Wall characters as opposed to the King's Landing characters. I get why Martin made this choice. I understand that he basically had a choice to do it this way and to achieve some complete character arcs or to split it with a big old \\"to be continued\\" down the middle. I have to admit, however, that I might have preferred the \\"to be continued\\" option. Perhaps I am dense or unimaginitive, but given that there will be most likely a year's gap between readings for me and given that there are so many characters I have a suspicion that it would have been difficult enough in a linear narrative to relate the events to each other. I have a bad feeling that I am going to be kind of lost when we get to the second book.<br /><br />Like I said, I respect and admire Martin, but I have to wonder if this issue could not have been worked out more effectively with his publisher. This way feels like a bit of a bad compromise. At least for the reader. I mean, the publisher is happy-- they get to not bring out a 1500 page book. Martin is happy since he didn't have to do violence to the character arcs. But is the reader really happy with this solution? Not so sure if I am, at any rate.<br /><br />Anyhow, I will definitely be giving the next book a read. Nothing will make Martin less than one of the best working fantasy writers. I am just confessing to being a tiny bit dubious about this approach.
B00004LN16|5.0|Review #273. Still waiting for Angus Young and crew's follow-up to this superb 2000 CD release. Just all around top of the game Australian meat-and-potato heavy metal.Some say that 'Stiff...' is JUST as good as their 1980 break-through 'Back In Black' album. I tend to agree with that. Tracks here that I found myself playing repeatedly were the title cut \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", \\"Meltdown\\", \\"Hold Me Back\\", \\"Satellite Blues\\" and the outstanding steady rocker \\"Give It Up\\" (should've been a million selling single). Simply a must-have.
B0009WQ3P0|5.0|Ideal gift for someone who really loves Fleetwood Mac.  This disc set has many of their old and best sellers.  I lost my cd box set to my 23 year old son so now i am retrieving the set.  This is the first time I have found this set in over 4 years are better.
B000301YY8|1.0|I'm sorry, but James Blunt has no singing ability.  He's concidered amazing over in Britain, but here, i don't think that he's concidered even remotly good.  His lyrics are completely too deep for the music industry.  No one want to have to have everything explained to them while they're trying to listen to a song.  It's all basically about suicide, and what kind of a message is that sending to our public.  <br /> <br />Everyone for everyone who does like him, i'll admit, for a while i was also oblivious to his obvious lack of talent, and found him to have just some type of special raspy voice.  His messages are a little dark and twisted, which again i was, and untill i found better music, like Snow Patrol and Jack's Mannequin, i was gravitating towards James Blunt more and more.  It was almost like some really freaky hypnotism and that was like the worst part about it. <br /> <br />So overall, it's not the best music out there.  It's not completely horrible, but there are plenty of other artist that you could be listening to.  James' voice is raspy and hard to understand, and his lyrics have a dark message to them, so for any emo people out there, you would get a lot out of the lyrics, but i feel that even you whould hate his voice.  It's really hard to concintrate to even the beat through the nastyness of his voice, so i give Back to Bedlam by James Blunt a 1 out of 5 stars.
B000J10ERO|3.0|Superman Returns is a strange movie to watch.  Gone is the square jawed linebacker sized hero.  Instead, newcomer Brandon Routh gives you a Superman that is more like Michelangelo's David: an almost sylph-like figure, that floats beautifully above us all, watching, protecting.  In doing so, the movie conveys, intentional or not, a great loneliness and vulnerability in the Man of Steel, but also, always, the sense of Duty.  Essentially, I liked Routh's version of the great hero.  But the rest of the casting is not very good.  Spacey and Langella, two really fine actors, are miscast.  They never seem to capture the elusive \\"whatever\\" that director Bryan Singer was able to capture with Routh.  Spacey is viscious at Lex Luthor, but he has no style.  Luthor has to have style, but Spacey gives us a villain that is just a dead eyed figure belonging to another genre: noir. Langella seems like he's on medication, and not the hyper editor we should expect.  Only Parker Posey, as Luthor's associate and babe Kitty, seems to remember that this is a story based upon a comic book.  Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is also miscast.  There were times I felt most of the supporting actors were sleepwalking through their roles. The story itself is somewhat incoherent, but I chalk that up to the film being something of an intended re-introduction (and grab bag) to the characters and elements of the Superman story.   However, despite all of these missteps, weirdly, the film works.  I guess, perhaps, because we all want a Superman up there, watching, protecting us all. And Superman Returns does remember that One Essential part of the story, and returns to it, smartly, again and again.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is simply a wonderful compilation representing the essence of musical talent of the Beatles.  Despite having tracks, this collection can only be appreciated in its entirety.  There are no individual songs but a continuous stream of music, songs and sounds taken from every stage in the evolution of Beatles music.  From Beatlemania to the mystical to the breakup, with all the joy and sadness in between.  It is so perfectly blended together by Sir George Martin that this is truly his greatest gift to all generations of Beatles lovers.  <br /> <br />As you listen to this beautiful work, go back through your old albums, CDs or singles and it will evoke memories of events surrounding the Beatles and in your own life, if you were there to hear the beginning. The songs from various stages in the Beatles evolution are put together according to the style of music they contain.  In between are fragments and pieces from other works that fully complement adjacent songs. The songs and sounds become an emotional link to the past. <br /> <br />When I first heard the entire work in streaming format, it was hard to tell that the stream had looped and played over.  In reality, I didn't care because I could have listened to it all day.  I hope others will listen to this wonderful musical work and appreciate it for the masterpiece that it surely is. <br /> <br />Thank you so much John, Paul, George, Ringo and Sir George Martin.
B00005JPCA|5.0|Bond is back; he's a dirty blond with eyes as blue as lapis on a sunny day. Mr. Craig is the best Bond in years and may be as good as the original Sean Connery although I haven't seen one of his James Bond movies in a long time. Even though we know that Bond will always survive, Craig's Bond is more vulnerable, more human and not as slick as some of his predecessors. And even though he wears Brioni suits and cuts a dashing figure in a tux, he can be a bit rough around the edges, another nice new touch as well.<br /><br />The plot has all the twists we expect from a first rate Bond film, the special effects and stunts are about as good as they get. There is a great scene in Venice where one of those stately old buildings comes down. Making this movie must have cost a fortune.<br /><br />Finally, the opening credits are a work of art. Make this film a pleasant two hours of great escape from all the bustle of December.
B00005JPCA|4.0|It's long and loud, and for much of the latter part of it, it's difficult to see just where \\"Casino Royale\\" is going, but it's still irresistible.  \\"Casino\\" has Bond out to stop a cold, calculating and compulsive gambler named Le Chiffre from bank-rolling hundreds of millions for terrorists.  The story occurs just as Bond has first received his \\"stripes\\" as a \\"double-o\\" agent for MI6 - a promotion he earns in a gritty pre-credits teaser by taking out a turncoat spy in Prague.  Sent to Madagascar to track a web of bomb-makers and their financiers, Bond instead assassinates the bomb-maker inside of a foreign embassy - an act of war unfortunately caught by closed circuit TV.  (Luckily for us, it also involves a dynamite foot-chase which has to be seen to be believed in and around a construction site.)  While M believes the mission a bust, Bond instead picks up the trail of the bomb-maker to Le Chiffre, figuring that the gambler's fortunes are tied to terrorism.  Hardly a believer in the causes he finances, Le Chiffre uses the millions of warlords to leverage his own schemes.  After Bond foils a spectacular scheme involving an airport and the maiden voyage of an airliner even bigger than the A-380, one that would have made millions for Le Chiffre, the terror-gambler is now stuck to earn his clients' money back.  For the West, it's a golden opportunity to catch Le Chiffre.  Unless he wins a multi-million dollar Poker Match in Montenegro, he'll have to surrender to Western intelligence or face the wrath of his ruthless clientele. (Bond's masters are betting on surrender.) <br /> <br />That's about all I can say about \\"Casino\\" because it is definitely a plot-thin, attitude-thick movie.  Craig plays a Bond who seems new to the role of killing people, but looks to be anticipating the bruised soul that his new job will come with.  He bonds with Vesper Lynd, in ways that previous Bonds haven't pulled off with their women.  This Bond makes do without gadgets or even many funnycatchphrases.  He gets bruised and beaten and he doesn't always have the steel resolve to insist on having his Martini shaken.  In other words, it's camp-free Bond - it's humorless but not without its share of wit.  It may not be your idea of a Bond movie, but it can't miss as a streamlined and efficient thriller.
B00005JPCD|3.0|This is the perfect example of how Hollywood tries to preach their message of liberalism and wacko environmentalist junk to the world, disguised in an apparently cute movie for kids. <br />Due to the trailer and previews we thought that Happy Feet would be a nice enjoyable flick. Well, there was initially somewhat of a good message in this film like it's okay to be different, especially if you can't help it, meaning if you were born that way with e.g. not a singing voice amongst Penguins, but instead with tap dancing feet. But let me tell you that there is some suggestive humor in the film that is not suitable for younger kids. In this film you'll find a distortion or even hatred of religion/Christianity, ... and last but not least you'll find an environmentalist agenda knocked right into your face ... so eating fish as humans will produce the result of starvation among the Penguins? <br />The expectations were great for this film to see perhaps a wholesame nice Saturday afternoon flick for the whole family, BUT it wasn't like that at all ... what a letdown.
078681859X|5.0|How I can I put into words how much I enjoyed this book, let alone the entire series? It seems impossible, but I feel compelled to spread the word about this remarkable trilogy that I accidentaly stumbled upon in my local bookstore. <br /> <br />I expected the story to be entertaining in the least; what I didn't expect and was pleasently surprised to find was a new voice in the somewhat convoluted genre of young fantasy. Stroud offers his readers a complex novel that explores themes of human corruption, enslavement, and finding an identity in a world that so desperately wants to define who you are. His take on this tired genre feels new and exciting, a feat that is definitely hard to attain. <br /> <br />The novel is rich in character development, something I feel many young adult novels sidestep in their rush to get to the action. You'll fall in love with the easy banter, as well as the sidesplitting asides, that Bartimaeus the djinni provides throughout the novel. His character alone is worth picking up this book for -- I have not been this entertained by a single character in a very, very long time. I eagerly awaited the chapters told through his perspective.  <br /> <br />The plot is likewise engaging. Stroud creates a world that is refreshingly darker and more cynical than the other more lighthearted, frivolous worlds found in this genre. I applaud him for his creativity and am amazed that a book aimed for an audience significantly younger than myself had me thiking as deeply about politics and human nature as this book did.   <br /> <br />If you are hesitant to pick up yet another wizard book (I admit, the plot sounds familiar: a young wizard pitted against a power that seems so much greater than himself), I wholeheartedly encourage you to push that doubt aside, immediately grab this book (along with the others in the trilogy -- hey, why not buy a boxed set?), and prepare yourself for a novel that never fails for a moment to keep you laughing and entertained.<br /> <br />A must read!!
B000I5X80G|4.0|This is great-sounding stuff, and it's a treat to have excellent live versions of less-familiar material like \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" and \\"Winterlong\\" not to mention the nifty early version of \\"Wonderin'\\" ... but there's no reason Neil couldn't have made this a double-CD.  There is a lot of other material from those Fillmore shows that should have been included.  That's the only reason I don't give this 5 stars, because as far as the SOUND goes, this CD is a gem.<br /><br />One point about \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\": it is the same recording that appears on \\"Tonight's The Night\\" except that on TTN, they edited the chorus (removing an extra line and a couple of bars of music).  To be honest, I prefer the tighter, edited version to the full one included here.<br /><br />The two long jams (Down By The River and Cowgirl In The Sand) are both stellar.  Neil works his Les Paul like a master, telling a winding story with his notes.  Gorgeous, essential readings of classic songs.<br /><br />MORE, Neil!  We need MORE!

B000JBXXZ4|3.0|First off , I own all of the Incubus cd's with (light grenades)   I was expecting way more \\"funk\\" but the more I listen to it the more I like it. It fits in as more of the Incubus experience overall than by an album by itself seems like it is aluding to another harder album   1.quiksand and 2.a kiss to send us off: starts off well kind of a beginning of a listening journey like incubus is known for.  3.Dig - kinda pop-ish but still ok.  4.Anna molly - very good try to pick up the irony of the title and the way the name is pronounced in the song.  5.Love hurts - pretty good for the slow part of the cd but...  6.Light Grenades-   hard core Incubus, this pendulous threads and anna molly are kinda what I was expecting.  7.earth to bella - I thought this title was a throwback to SCIENCE , WRONG seems weepy aludes to a serious jam but never really gets there until part two (duh)  8.Oil and water- a good song may have fit in on ACLOTM.  9.diamonds and coal- really pop-ish ok but no incubus funk at all  10.Rogues- An Incubus song with harmony good stuff.  11.Paper shoes - starts off acoustic with an off time drum ,stays off time  almost jazzy incubus, would be great purely acoustic kinda like \\"Mexico\\"  on Morning View.  12. Pendulous Threads -This is Incubus good stuff this will probably cause serious \\"bouncing\\" at a concert, if you've seen an incubus video ,especially \\"certain shade of green \\" you know what I mean\\"  13. earth to bella part 2- a good way to end   Taken as awhole with the other incubus albums there all good and If you listen to them all in a series It is a trip not a single statement.    Note: This is the last decent Incubus CD, the new one for 2011 titled : If not now, when?  is best left on the shelf...

0399241523|5.0|I've loved anthony horowitz seince the first alex rider book. This one is great it is a little slwo but still amazing. I like the hole outer space thing very well thought out, but the one down side of the book is that it was another millionare i would like to see more diffrent bad guys like a gang or something. It is still one of the best books ive ever read five stars all the way!!!!!!!!!
B000IZJZLM|3.0|Well, I really like Il Divo for their voices and style, but I have to say that the cookie cutter approach their producers are using is getting rather staid. <br /> <br />If you own any of the previous 3 releases Il Divo has churned out in less than 3 years of existence, then you have already heard this new album! <br />Same musical approach, same vocal arrangements, and yes...same languishing musical selections.  <br />The only thing that is different of course are the actual songs....all of which are covers made famous by other major artists before them. <br /> <br />My biggest problem with this CD is not the fact that it is only 41 minutes / 10 songs long...though that does seem odd in an age were 12-16 tracks is the norm. <br />My real issue is in that they covered CARUSO, which is one of my favorite songs and totally butchered it...literally! <br />Most of the people listening to this CD will not know the lyrics to this song by heart as I do, but they have chopped up the lyrics in a way where the song makes no sense at all anymore. They've cut entire sections out of the song and transposed it down so low that it lost it's dramatic effect...much like Josh Groban did...but at least he sang the WHOLE song...as written. <br /> <br />Oddly there were also a number of linguistic errors with this song and other Italian songs on here. Seems their Italian pronunciation has fallen by the wayside since their initial release. Again, this will not keep the average Il Divo fan from loosing sleep, but it bothered me. <br /> <br />The major saving grace on this CD is of course their voices....Carlos' deep and powerful bari/tenor sound seems to dominate over the other guys and really adds to each song they sing. <br /> <br />I really hope that with the next release, which I imagine to be due in less than a year given the current production record, they will be allowed to take some risks and venture into more artistically challanging directions, perhaps following Bocelli into theLatin standard field, or embrace some mid-tempo groove type songs such as Luther Vandross was known for. <br /> <br />I hope they get a chance to change their approach in the future, but as long as legions of middle aged house wives buy their products in droves, this may be nothing but a idle notion for the time being.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Didn't expect the movie to be as good as the book, but the scenes are beautiful and the casting is perfect.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I don't really want to take the time to write an extensive review.  I'm in 100% agreement with ALL of the positive reviews that have already been written.  As with EVERY Incubus album, you should go into Light Grenades with no expectations.  Each of their albums has represented a change in sound, and a forward progression in maturity.  Keeping with this theme, Light Grenades is a slight departure from the Incubus that you've gotten to know since 1995.  But in NO way is that a bad thing.  It would be a disgrace to creativity and innovation for them to create another album like Fungus, SCIENCE, MY, MV, or ACLOTM.  As such, this album comes out of left field and gives you strong punch in the nose.  Simply Amazing.
B00006CXSS|5.0|for me! Love this series could watch it over and over. Hope my wife gets it for me for Christmas.
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|I had done a review on this some time ago and I must admit I'm ashamed to say I gave this film a really bad review. I actually fell asleep the first time watching this movie. I was with friends and we had a few drinks and we were not expecting such a deep film. So with that in mind we were all waiting for this film to get going. I decided I needed to give this film another chance and I would watch it in my home theater(which was not built the first time I watched this movie).<br /><br />This film is a comic book geeks dream come true. There is so much attention to detail in this movie that it takes an hour before we see The Batman. I am sure this is what put some people off who didn't like this film, but I found myself engrossed in this man's personal journey. To be fair to mainstream movie goers, I was a big comic book reader in my youth and I still love super hero films and collectables to this day, so this film might be a tad bit tedious and dark for a person who really isn't into comic book heroes.<br /><br />Although I did enjoy this film it seemed to be a little too serious for my taste. A casual movie go-er might want to try Spider-Man, it's got a great story and it's a lot of fun....something I expect from a superhero movie. OK, all you DC fans I'm bracing myself...............;-b
B000E1MTY0|4.0|As other reviewers have already mentioned, this is a great movie.  Nolan makes not just a great superhero movie, but a great movie in general.  And the HD-DVD version of the film makes it all the more better.  On other resolutions I felt like the movie was almost lighted too dark, that I was somehow missing things.  But in the stunning high definition I felt Gotham was a city I've been to, its details were so sharp, but without losing the darkness and moodiness the movie needs.<br /><br />My only complaint with this, and the other HD titles I've purchased so far, is this..<br /><br />Where are all of the fantastic extras we were promised?  Part of the technology is the storage capabilities, so they should be able to just pack these discs with hours and hours of HD extras.  High tech extras that have more interaction with the disc.<br /><br />In some cases with the HD movies I've purchased so far, there aren't even as many extras on them as the DVD versions of the film, much less more.<br /><br />I know they're trying to build this new technology and get some momentum, so why not take advantage of all the new technology has to offer and stuff these things with extras, the very types of things that DVD enthusiasts already enjoy?<br /><br />Great movie and I recommend the technology to everyone, just hoping that they start making something bigger and better out of these discs than just a higher resolution and sound.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I really wanted to love this movie, but it's really hard to point out it's good points. Clocking in at 2hrs and 40 minutes, you might think this was 'The Godfather'! This movie has two serious flaws....it's not much fun and it's very boring at times. They don't even have the excuse of getting the origin out of the way. This is supposed to be a sequel....right? Why do Lois and Clark look younger now than they did 20 years ago in the first two movies? I know it is only 5 years time in movieland, but they look like they are ten years younger not 5 years older. Jimmy Olson still looks like a high school kid though.<br /><br />Brandon Routh had some big shoes to fill and the truth is, the kid does a pretty good job imatating Reeves....maybe too good, it only made me miss him all the more. Kate Bosworth's Lois is flat and without the quirky charm of Margot Kidder. There are several silly action scenes too....Superman gets blasted with a gigantic gun that could blow holes in a battleship and when there is no effect on him, the thug pulls out a hand gun and shoots him with that too!(OK the bullit in the eye was pretty cool!) The action scenes are very well done, but the scenes with Superman and Lois floating around are not romantic, but yawn inducing! I also found it ridiculous that Lois's body would stay perfectly and effortlessly straight horizonally while flying with Superman, just by having his arm loosely around her waist.<br /><br />I know this is a comic book movie, but if you are trying to make the characters realistic, then I'm going to question these types of things. Some good news is the new Superman costume is cool. With some serious editing this could have been a great film as there are some good ideas in this uneven comic film. In the end, it just isn't very fun and it lacks the heart that Christopher Reeves brought to the role!(Shouldn't all superhero movies be fun???).....and I thought 'Batman Begins' was too serious!...Hoo Boy! ;-( ......at least that film had a brain!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I seen this movie for the first time last Christmas (2005) with my brother and his family. I purchased for myself even though I have no children, but I do love holiday classics. I have read some of the reviews from this movie and sometimes people over analyze things. This movie is just best watched purely for its entertainment and spectactular effects. Tom Hanks gives you a special nostalgic feeling of Christmas of our youth filled with magic and anticipation along with a humanistic value to think of people less fortunate than ourselves. A purely classic Christmas time favorite.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Although Whitney's performace on this CD is not as perfect as ALL of her other work, we must consider she was working with L.A. Reid, the head of Arista at the time and as with the CD Just Whitney... it is just a different kind of sound and production than what Houston usually delivers.  Even on Whitney's worst day she can, AND DOES out-sing any other performer living or dead.  My favorite track has to be Little Drummer Boy, I love the arrangement and Whitney Rocks.  I am so glad Whitney has dumped that loser of a husband and I have no doubt she will rise to the top again.  Whitney is and will always be the greatest vocalist to ever live.  God has blessed her, and has blessed us with her talents.  THANK YOU NIPPY!!!
0393061310|4.0|Having traveled extensively, I've often wondered why particular groups and cultures were not more successful.  It's clear to me that regardless of race or culture, no particular subset of humanity averages smarter or \\"better,\\" and yet, some are tremendously advanced while others are still trying to jumpstart their societal development. <br /> <br />Diamond does a great job of explaining how various factors of geography and agriculture lead to the beginnings of civilization and spread in various directions at various rates.  The check on the theory, of course, is the Mississippian Culture of North America, that achieved cities in the tens or hundreds of thousands, only to collapse under the logistical strain and hygiene issues they were not placed to resolve.  I'd never been a supporter of the extermination theory of Ice Age megafauna, but Diamond presented it in such a way I'm forced to concede the point, and I'm notoriously hard to sway. <br /> <br />I can't give it four stars, because I would liked to have seen more figures and references rather than the overview given.  It's certainly detailed and thorough, but is more a public presentation than scholarly.  This does make it more accessible and readable, and is clearly what was intended, but I would have appreciated a more technical work. <br /> <br />As others have noted, reviewer Agnew, who ironically boasts degrees in literature and law, clearly has not read the work, because his criticisms are directly addressed in the text.  One would hope that someone so trained would give a full read and a complete analysis before commenting.

B000GG4KTU|1.0|She sounds like a bad impression of a young Nancy Wilson. There is no melody, no lilt or song to her voice. She doesn't dip and possesses a very short range.<br /><br />When she sings she sounds like she's talking or just shopping and humming a ditty. I honestly gave her a chance and really listened to her. I've heard a live performance and I just didn't get her appeal. Then I thought, oh, some individuals are looking for a jazzy European woman. She's attractive. She wears her hair wild for attention. That's why she's called classy. But what do your ears tell you?<br /><br />If you want to hear REAL singing check out singers such as Patti Austin, Nnenna Freelon, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Diane Schuur!<br /><br />Diana beats anybody in her category? Name names. Because I have heard other singers and Diana is the only one who absolutely cannot sing. Do you listen to other voices? Do yourself a favor and listen to some samples of Patti Austin, Diane Schuur, Nnenna Freelon, Sarah Vaughan and Karrin Allyson with your eyes closed then listen to this cardboard.<br /><br />It's obvious she's using sex to sell the CD. She's lying down on the cover with her hair splayed as if she just had a wonderful night with her husband. There is no need for that if the music is good! Even her true fans have abandoned her because I think they actually listened this time.
B000002OMN|3.0|The music on the CD is defiantly a A Bat Out Of Hell Series Classic but the overall quality of the sound is sad; I felt as if my Bose 501 speakers had a bowl of Rice Krispies inside and as soon as I played the Bat Out Of Hell 3 their was a noticeably pleasant sound coming from the speakers;Quality!each Cd was purchased from Amazon,NEW...
B000JJS8TM|5.0|To really appreciate The Beatles Love(CD+AudioDVD) one has to get over the notion of tampering with the sacred fab catalog.This new colleection produced by George Martin and his son Giles,presents a new listening experience to familiar Beatles classics.By using the latest technology such as PRO-TOOLS AND ADDING INSTRUMENTALS FROM OTHER BEATLES SONGS,THEN MIXING THEM TOGETHER OR IN TRANSITIONS BETWEEN TRACKS,CREATES a fun new way to hear these songs.Both discs are revelatory but the DVD-Audio actually seems to reach out and grab you.Also,many of the tunes have never sounded better sonicly as with (A Day In The Life,I Want To Hold Your Hand,and Hey Jude).Combining (Drive My Car) with (What Your Doing) or(Mr.Kite) with (She's So Heavy) works in a wonderful way. Many Beatles fans understandably are leary of tampering with the sacrosanct catalog,however,this new set is a labor of love by the producers and alot of fun.Until the Beatles catalog is revamped in the next year or two,Love is the only way to hear(26 songs) the Beatles in 5.1 surround sound!Ultimately,this new set is both an audiophiles and Beatles fan's delight.

B00005JLWN|5.0|As it appears by a majority of the reviews on here, I stumbled across this movie by accident.  I do see now why this movie was overlooked and at points discarded...it is not for lack of effect.  Equilibrium does what a lot of movies do - it retells a tale that's already been told.  The comparison to THE MATRIX is a fleeting one, in terms of the story.  THe only connection this film has with the other is the look.  And while I have seen MINORITY REPORT and BRAVE NEW WORLD listed as reference to this movie, EUILIBRIUM's greatest source/inspiration has yet to be listed...1984.  From the daily propaganda speeches to FATHER to the love interest that sparks personal insurgence, this movie owes its greatest debt to George Orwell.  While I will not go so far as to call this movie a rip-off or poor man's 1984, the similarites to the two are incontrivertable.  The best summation for this movie would be what I have titled this review - 1984 UPDATED.   <br />If you want to see a (graphically appealing) retelling of 1984, then this is a movie that you should see.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|This album continues a distressing pattern of behavior begun during the Anthology project: the cutting up and reconfiguring of songs that were already perfectly good and in need of no repair.  While it's possible that such an endeavor could yield intriguing and semi-satisfying results, it's not likely.  I remember being disappointed by the historically unjustified, slapdash treatment given \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"A Day in the Life\\" in 1996 for the Anthology, and God only knows how anyone could believe that the vocal part of \\"Because\\" is improved shorn of its metric and harmonic underpinning (although I suspect \\"This Boy\\" or \\"Nowhere Man\\" might fare better).  That stripped-down version of \\"Because\\" is repeated here as the opening track of LOVE.  Apparently the Martins liked it enough to whittle a verse of \\"Sun King\\" likewise, running this new one backwards for good measure.  It IS interesting, but doesn't succeed as John's reversed vocal in \\"Rain\\" had so beautifully back in 1966.<br /><br />There are for me two ideas here in LOVE that almost work.  One is the overlay of Paul's vocal \\"What You're Doing\\" into the verse of \\"Drive My Car\\".  Here we have identical metric/harmonic structures and the result is initially, at least, surprisingly good.  They did have me tooling along with that one - until the whole thing crashed with the forced introduction of Paul's guitar solo from \\"Taxman\\" which, having been tailored specifically for a drone harmony, sounds painfully crude and out of place over the I/IV chord alternation.  The other is the splicing together of the four versions of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  You know the ones: John and guitar; Take One with the mellotron; finished Record One; and finished Record Two with the trumpets and cellos.  This is good - very good, in fact, until various bits of nonsense from other songs, such as Paul's \\"Helter Skelter\\", are rudely and pointlessly interjected.<br /><br />Three other ideas that fall particularly flat: 1) anorchestral sequence from \\"Good Night\\" used as the backdrop for the beginning of \\"Octopus's Garden\\" - Ouch!! What a discordant mess!! 2) Eric Clapton's legendary solo from \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" hung out to dry in some alien musical territory so that poor Eric sounds tone deaf and oblivious to what's going on around him, and 3) a loop of squealing noise, I believe from \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\", which follows every chorus of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" - Eeyow!!<br /><br />And will someone kindly tell me just what is gained by opening \\"Yesterday\\" with a bit of the guitar from \\"Blackbird\\"?<br /><br />There are some good things to be said about this recording. The sound quality is lovely and clear - parts of \\"Help\\" and \\"A Day in the Life\\", for instance, have never sounded better. Also, George Martin's new string accompaniment to the early, acoustic recording of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", although honestly adding next to nothing, is nevertheless pleasing.<br /><br />Even so, I came away from my three days of listening to LOVE feeling that here is a kind of Frankenstein Monster.  Even in stretching boundaries as \\"the boys\\" did, they thought logical and reasonable musical thoughts. Every one of these songs had been done, pre-LOVE, in some manner which was fitting and proper, exhilarating and immortal, so what exactly was the point of doctoring them? Where was the necessity?<br /><br />Contrarily, so much of what is here is unnatural, illogical and (yes, it must be said) painfully unmusical.  I'm certainly glad to have heard it, but if I never do again, I can live with that.  I can't say that I find these results of Giles Martin's labor to be a worthy addition to the Beatle catalogue, but this being a soundtrack of sorts (even if not a very good one), I could be unfairly judging not having seen the Cirque de Soleil production.  It just may be, however, that irrelevant press paeans to George Martin notwithstanding, after four decades the Beatle well has finally run dry.
044100590X|5.0|Dune has clearly cemented its place in the Sci-Fi and literary canon on the legitimate strengths of its deep plot and intricate internal philosophy, the fact that it also includes a deep political underpinning only adds to its ability to insinnuate itself into the zeit-geist of the day.  What I find odd is the seeming lack of uniform assent that Dune and Paul Ateides stem from the story of T.E. Lawrence.  The connection to the desert setting is obvious, less so is how the abiding love that Lawrence has for the beautiful austerity for the desert and the discipline it engenders is incorporrated into Paul Atreides and Liet Kynes and resonnates outward thoroughout the course of the story.  Even though the vision of Paul Atreides and Liet Kynes is the transformation of the harsh landscape, all of the \\"prophets\\" of Dune see the need to maintain the deep desert of Arrakis for the faithful.  The maintenace of the desert, on the surface, is a concession to the economics of Dune, the giant sandworms require the deep desert for the chemical catalyst of the spice menlange, the drug that stands in for petroleum as the center of the economic commentary portion of this masterpiece.  Stangely lost in the economic strategy is the complete lack of effort by anyone to synthesize the drug despite the presence of a scientific cult race, the Ix, who's best effort to break the economic monopoly is to smuggle young sandworms off-planet.  The meaning seems clear, like Lawrence, Dune values the desert for the way it alters the character of those who live in its presence.  Other signs that Lawrence was the inspiration are not hard to find: a \\"voice from the outside\\" that serves a leadership roll for a hiterto fragmented band of nomads (the bedouin for Lawrence and the Fremen for Paul Atreides).  The manner in which Larence created a guerilla force that attacked and moved, attacked and moved, is matched exactly by Paul Aterides in Dune.  For Lawrence, the opressing forces were the Turks and the subtle and political overseers,the British, for Paul Atriedes they are the Harkonnens and the Bene Gessirit/Great Houses.  The end of colonial imperialism is a fact for both Lawrence and Paul.  Both men, powerful and visionary though they are, have no desire to hold onto power or godhood, they both want the people to be responsible for their destiny.  Although there are many more similarities, suffice it to say that, for me, Dune certainly serves as a paen to the indominitable spirit of T.E. Lawrence.  Just one more facet of a book that works on so many levels.
B000002QWD|5.0|I love the season's atmosphere, so I'm in love with Xmas songs, and I have many cd's... so why, oh why, I keep listening to this one alone year after year?<br /><br />BECAUSE IT'S LOVELY, that's why!! :)))<br /><br />a good mix of slow traditional songs and merrier modern ones... I'm particularly fond of Mele Kalikimaka... I know Xmas is on its way when I find myself singing this one under my breath, totally unaware of what I'm singing :))))
B00005JPBJ|5.0|your time is running out...if you haven't seen SAW 3 in the theater you have to because the big screen adds to the experience. <br />i can tell you this as a fact i own saw and saw 2 dvd's and i didn't see them at the theater, and i did make it to saw 3 at the theater and it was awesome and the big screen added to the movie. <br />so i strongly encourage saw fans and horror fans alike to get to the theater before it is no longer playing near you.
B00006I53S|4.0|This is a good deal for the money. Image Quality is good, zoom range is great, build quality is decent (some wobble still). IS actually works correctly. <br /> <br />Now in the age of DSLRs, this lens is probably not wide enough for general purpose walk around use. It also uses the \\"old style\\" IS which cannot be used in panning mode. This lens also doesn't have as great of IQ as L glass such as the 24-105L, 17-40L and 24-70L, namely lacking in color and contrast. Also, f5.6 at the long end is somewhat dim.
B000I9X54Q|5.0|I loved this movie. I watched it on a DVD though and not through Amazon's movie service. I like to own my products and if I can't save it to a DVD then it's pointless because I can watch it in a movie theater for less. <br /> <br />Can I put these on a DVD after buying them? Then I'd do it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really enjoy certain DVD series but this one at first did not seem appealing to me at all.  My brother kept encouraging me to watch it and I kept putting him off, eventually I finally watched the launch episode and I was hooked, I watched like 4 more episodes that day and finished off the rest of the series that week... Awesome Series, Perfect gift for any Sci-Fi Fan!!!!
B000AL51OO|5.0|One of the best bands I have ever heard. Tarja Turunen hot as hell <br />
B00005JPC7|5.0|'Stranger than Fiction' is a cracking movie and I thoroughly recommend it. <br /> <br />Like a good book, it draws you in and is a movie you won't want to put down. You get the feeling that (just like a good book) every scene is essential to the plot. There are no throwaway, knockabout or unessential scenes in this movie. Everything is important and worthy of your attention. <br /> <br />Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are, as always, excellent, while Maggie Gyllenhaal is efforvescent and totally believable as the baker who falls for Will Ferrell's character the IRS agent. But it is Ferrell who is the most outstanding, giving a superb performance. We are big Will Ferrell fans in our family, but I for one wasn't sure that he could pull this one off. But his performance is maganificent. His deadpan delivery is outstanding and his transformation absolutely believable in this great movie. <br /> <br />The message of the film 'live for today' may be familiar, but the method of delivery in 'Stranger Than Fiction' is clever, original and very entertaining. <br /> <br />Although it's a comedy, it's not laugh out loud, but it will make you smile alot and you'll leave the cinema thinking 'that was a good movie'.  <br /> <br />It's often easy to try to read too much into movies and over-intellectualise. Just enjoy this as a good story, well told and superbly acted. I'll be looking to add the DVD to my collection as soon as it's released.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is the first Muse album I've listened to, and WOW! This is what alternative rock should be -- it's phenomenal. Many of the songs are piano-infused rock, which may sound unusual at first but is actually quite powerful. There is something likeable about each of the songs, and it is an especially good album for singing (or belting out at the top of your lungs) in the car. My favorite track is \\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist,\\" although interestingly it seems to be among other reviewers' least favorite.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Many popular artists stray from their usual format into the realm of Christmas music, but few pull it off well, or garner much attention doing so.  Sarah puts her own delecate spin on it until it sounds magical and ethereal.  Many of these songs have been done again and again by countless other artists, such as \\"River\\" and the old classic \\"Have yourself a merry little Christmas\\" but Sarah has taken every track on this album and made it her own.  This album is definitely my new Christmas favorite!
B0002KVUL6|3.0|Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Were it not for these two gifted performers, this movie would be beyond silly. As it is, the plot is almost pretextual for the special effects.<br /><br />The Eye Candy factor is high, though. Hugh Jackman as the tortured hero, filmed in the dark all of the time, makes us weak in the knees. Kate Beckinsale does magnificent physical feats while squeezed into a corset.<br /><br />The story: Van Helsing (Jackman) is essentially a bounty hunter of supernatural monsters, a job he took on at the request of the church as apparent penitence for sins he cannot even remember. As a reward for his centuries of service, he hopes to make his way to Heaven instead of Hell.<br /><br />Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is the last survivor of a family of Transylvanian vampire hunters. Her brother has become a werewolf and she is conflicted about whether he should live or die.<br /><br />Naturally Anna and Van Helsing team up to rid Transylvania of the evil vampire overlord. Van Helsing has a tool kit Batman would envy, and Anna maintains an arsenal of monster-killing weapons that would make a survivalist proud. Between the two of them, the monsters don't stand a chance.<br /><br />Put your mind on hold, suspend disbelief and intolerance for the occasional leap of reason, enjoy a slightly randy friar (Van Helsing's sidekick), and go along for the ride. Van Helsing is a great Sunday afternoon video.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|it almost seems like critics have to slop his name over anything to get pulp fiction fans to rave about it. next your gonna hear someone passing by you saying to someone \\"oldboy, yeah, its directed by tarantino\\"...<br /><br />yeah, just like how he directed hero & hostel, right?<br /><br />alright rant aside. this film is one of the best films to currently be coming out of the east. i believe it is one of the best(and one of the more original) revenge thrillers out there. the story is amazingly sinister, the settings are both beautiful & grim, and the acting is top quality, especially the lead of Dae Su, i cant recall the actor's name at the moment, but he created a truly colorful, yet cursed character who really grows onto you through the film's progression, all the way to it's disturbing finale.<br /><br />one thing i'll give tarantino credit for is his appreciation of films like these as well as the tons of others you probably wont ever see. i just dont understand why people must emulate \\"his\\" movie interest, oh well i guess that just makes people feel more \\"original\\" *rolls eyes*<br /><br />i also recommend checking out takashi miike's black society trilogy or the infamous ichi the killer if your into the gritty underworld of asian cinema.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Some people crack me up; punk rock is over thirty years old and we hear the same old arguments. They are selling out! It's poppy! WTF? Punk music CREATED what \\"pop\\" music would become--it was a way to sell mediocre bands for massive amounts of money, a.k.a. the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. And do not even try to argue that these later bands were musically talented. They were fun, but they were not Mozart. God. So please, do not even bring these \\"sell out\\" arguments into analyzing The Black Parade.  <br /> <br />MCR was out to sell an album, but they were out to sell a GOOD album; they were out to make a musical composition. The Black Parade flows, and it all works together. It is not one or two good songs and a bunch of filler. It has a theme, and the music is correlated and emotional. Is it as dark as their other tunes? Probably not, but who the hell cares? Why do we have to be \\"as dark\\" in our music as humanly possible? What's wrong with a little bit of sweet melancholy?  <br /> <br />Music isn't about being an identity or a culture. It's about making music. If it sells records, it doesn't mean its a bad album either. If you can listen to The Black Parade five times in a row and still not have it memorized, and still find yourself impacted emotionally, its a five star album. I think I've listened to this piece 8 or 9 times and I'm still loving it. So Buy it. Or download it. Whatever you do, don't knock on it because it wasn't what you expected. <br /> <br />If it wasn't what you expected that should be a GOOD thing. It means a band is experimenting, and MCR is taking this in a good direction. They're more developed than they used to be, and they're more musically complex. If a band isn't experimenting, they're dead.
6302886228|5.0|This is the greatest album I have ever owned. It steered me onto artists that I didn't know before. Oh all the wonderful hours I have spent playing the tape over and over. I too am ready for a new visual medium (DVD)
B0000AOV85|5.0|\\"The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon\\" was originally an episode of a TV series called \\"Classic Albums\\", which looked at the making of various albums including episodes for Queen's \\"A Night at the Opera\\", U2s \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and Cream's \\"Disraeli Gears\\". They are all authorized and featuring original band members involved. I have seen this particular episode a couple of times before, but it's worth picking up on DVD, because there's at least half an hour of extra footage provided as special features. I'm more of a Syd Barrett-era fan, but I do enjoy this documentary quite a lot. <br /> <br />In the documentary, there's interviews from Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright, along with producer Alan Parsons, among others, reflecting on themes, origins of ideas, and feelings of the time. There's also a couple of unique perfomances of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" tracks, a couple of Roger Waters' home demos from the 1970s, and a demonstration of how various sounds on the record were added and mixed. The sample loop for \\"Money\\" was cleverly done, I thought. You get a feel for who they are and what they were doing, which is cool too. <br /> <br />Worth a look for Pink Floyd fans and lovers of classic rock.
B00005JPC7|3.0|Stranger Than Fiction reminds me of the kind of profound thinking that doesn't seem quite as trenchant after you've had a chance to sober up.  The writers have to be very young to think this stuff has weight, but therein lies the charm of the film.  Stranger Than Fiction is a blast from the past for middle-agers like me. It is glimmer from a time when you any thought seemed brilliant, and just the fact that you were asking the big questions was exhilarating. Pure nostalgia, in other words.<br /><br />The central conceit of the film is rather trite, and inconsistently utilized, but provides a vehicle for a pretty nice bit of romance between Will Ferrell and a remarkably sexy Maggie Gyllenhaal. With Ferrell looking defiantly youthful, and Gyllenhaal looking sweet, but haggard, they come out feeling about the same age, and there's some nice dialogue and chemistry between the two. Dustin Hoffman does a nice turn as a rather gross English professor, despite having to muddle through mainly half-baked and incoherent expositions that serve no purpose other than to force the movie to press ahead to its conclusion.<br /><br />The conclusion, sadly, is a maudlin and monumental failure, redolent of Hallmark and American Express commercials. It fishes up the old cliches about what gives life meaning, and spoons them back to us in big, syrupy chunks. Sadly, it diminishes everything that came before, and left me feeling more queasy than redeemed or enlightened.<br /><br />I think Stranger Than Fiction deserves a 3 for some nice acting, but a largely forgettable script dampens the whole affair.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|This movie is definitely worth watching. There is a cruise ship called Poseidon and it is hit by a rogue wave. This is a movie in which there is one location and the characters are trying to stay alive in their location. <br /> <br />There is good acting and each of the characters did their own stunts. The two things I did not like were the abrupt ending and the fact that they show the ship captains as suddenly startled about what is happening.   <br /> <br />Overall I think the good points of this movie out weighed the bad points. The movie is a non stop thriller.   <br />
B00005NOOH|5.0|Many of the reviewers have mentioned that this is one of the best, if not THE BEST documentary treatment of World War II ever released. I would have to agree. Part of this reason is the fact that the interviews in this documentary are with many major and minor participants who generously granted interviews on this particular subject. Most of whom are no longer alive. The primary source material of these individuals: Generals, Ambassadors, Statesmen, and soldiers who participated in the events leading up to the war, during the war, and after the war give an insight to events that are lacking in many other documentaries of this horrific war.<br /><br />I remember watching these films each and every sunday night; and the haunting music and footage stayed with me for a long, long time. This is without a doubt the most comprehensive documentary of the second world war around. This documentary is for now the definitive history of the war. There have been some very good documentaries that have been released in recent years which focus on individual battles, however, as far as the scope and vastness of the \\"World at War\\" nothing compares or comes close to this outstanding documentary. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]
B000002UTY|2.0|Having read several reviews after purchasing and listening to this thing I have to say I am mystified by the devotion and false hoopla this cd has generated.  Parts of it are worthy of a second listening but much of it is some of the most boring tripe put to record - not avant-garde or ahead-of-it's-time or even very good psychedelia.  Just tired old hippie-stoner droning drivel.  Certainly it's devotees are lost in the foggy halcyon days of yore, fondly remembering their first time listening to it - sitting around their dorm rooms high on hashish, which may have made this much more listenable.  Perhaps I should try that! <br />A very disappointing experience.
B000HIVO64|4.0|As long as Beck has been in the game, he's allowed for some breathing room, in the sense of he gets to use sounds he's already used. On The Information, it starts out with Odelay and goes to Guero and moves on to a number of his other albums but it makes for a solid product. Most other musicians couldn't do this, maybe for a few reasons but the main one being that they aren't good or cool enough. With influences reaching from one end of the musical spectrum to the other, Beck uses moderation in the greatest way possible, bringing everything together for one hell of a dance album or just one hell of an album all together. Sad, happy, sad, happy, back and forth, the whole time. Whatever, it's Beck, he does what he wants.    Listen to Cellphone's Dead and tell me that it doesn't sound like Lyrics Born.
B00005JPCC|4.0|The film has already got positive reviews from many critics, most of which are more or less based on the film's new James Bond image. We must give due credit to Daniel Craig for reinventing Bond, making him a tougher and meaner super-spy. Of course some people just don't want re-inventing it, but even they would admit Bond series needed something refreshing. At least Martin Campbell did it successfully, but totally in a different way from in `GoldenEye.' <br /> <br />Many reviewers have rightly pointed out the differences of the newer Bond. You will notice (and perhaps regret) the absence of gadgets (and Q or R) in the film, but actually the most notable one is that they set the plot in the post 9/11 era. The story is about the earliest days of 007, but the changed setting lends considerable power to the intense actions, some of which are more violent than you expect. And there is one torture scene. <br /> <br />`Casino Royale' contains three big action sequences, and they are all really thrilling ones - the first one at the construction site includes lots of eye-popping stunts - but as I said, there is something dark and serious undertone in some of them. While watching Pierce Brosnan's Bond (which I like), I never took anything seriously. This cannot be said about `Casino Royale' where one long action sequence takes place at airport. <br /> <br />Not that the film is free from escapism, In fact the main story involves a silly idea about the confrontation between a terrorist banker and a British agent at a card table, and the latter being backed up by the government's money! Eva Green plays Vesper who is in charge of the money, but in spite of the beauty of Ms Green Bond's romance with her is the least effective in the film.  <br /> <br />`Casino Royale' marks the successful return of James Bond with Daniel Craig in character, but not all fans would love it. But that happened many times before, and will in the future. It's destiny of popular series. The point is `Casino Royale' played for high stakes by creating a darker image of most famous spy. Probably whether or not the filmmakers will ultimately keep on doing that depends on the results at the box-office. But anyway I bought a ticket, and enjoyed the film pretty much.   <br />
B00005NB8K|3.0|Calling this movie \\"The Doors\\" is misleading. It would be more accurate to call it \\"Jim Morrison and Those Other Guys In the Band,\\" since that is how it's presented.<br /><br />It's always tempting to latch onto a rock legend in these rock biopics, and Oliver Stone clings like a limpet to the ghost of Jim Morrison. Acid-soaked scenery and mysticism are in every scene, but Stone seems content to wallow in the rock'n'roll debauchery rather than get into Morrison's head.<br /><br />It opens with a voiceover of Jim Morrison's poetry, as we slowly fade into a stalled recording session. Then it flips back to 1949, as Morrison's family drives through the desert. The boy catches a glimpse of several Indians by the road -- and one of them dies as the family leaves.<br /><br />Then it flips ahead to Morrison's (Val Kilmer) years at college -- he crashes a party for a pretty girl, makes arty films, acid-trips, and devotes himself to poetry. Then his pal Ray Manzarek (Kyle McLachlan) creates a rock band, with Morrison's poetry and voice as the centerpiece. Soon The Doors become a fixture in L.A. -- and then a famed band.<br /><br />But as the Doors become more famous, Morrison increasingly loses himself in the messianic-Dionysian-rocker role that has been set out for him. He weds a witch-journalist (Katherine Quinlan) but loves his fey girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). And when he outrages the authorities with the threat of public exposure, the spiral starts that will only lead to death.<br /><br />Stone certainly knew how to evoke the golden ages of rock'n'roll. Lots of sex, kinetic concerts, and bizarre behavior where Morrison jumps up on platforms and screams, \\"I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!\\" The whole movie just kind of sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />And Stone is quite brilliant with the direction. The movie is filmed like an acid trip -- shifting multicoloured skies, Indian ghosts, shadows on the sand, and eerie lighting. And it touches on other aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic. The other Doors are relegated to a frame for Morrison's bizarre behavior, and after the first half hour, they basically fade away. And he gets too enamored of his own style with the Indian ghost, and the arty \\"dead man\\" final scenes.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a shockingly good job with the languid, unpredictable energy of Morrison. He sings well too. Sadly, his performance is stuck in a one-note character -- Stone opts to potray him just as a random, sleazy, wild jerk, and we don't get a single insight into his thoughts. Sure, Morrison could be horrible. But this is Jim Morrison as rock cliche, not as a human being.<br /><br />And sadly, none of the other actors get much chance to expand on their roles -- the other Doors actors, including MacLachlan, basically play slightly annoyed accessories, and Meg Ryan plays a sweet girl without many other dimensions. Although Crispin Glover has a tiny, memorable role as Andy Warhol.<br /><br />\\"The Doors\\" opens into a beautiful psychedelic movie, but Stone fails to give it a soul.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Easily one of the best concert DVDs around. The chemistry between the band members is evident. The ease with which they complement each other is truly a sight to behold. Joe Walsh is his usual talented laid back self. Glenn Frey can barely hold his laughter in - this guy laughs easily, which is a lot of fun in itself. The tracks are not all Eagles - there are some solos from Henley, and Walsh. On the whole a very enjoyable concert. One thing nice about watching it on TV, is to be thankful that I'm not behind the 3 very annoying girls in the front row who insist on standing up, and dancing (indoors - go figure). I'd hate to be the ones behind these three bimbos. Another annoying thing is Timothy B. Schmidt begging for attention. \\"Please sit down - I'm about to sing\\", or when he's trying to make an entrance in one of the featurettes - Is this guy so emotionally unstable that he needs to call attention to himself constantly, or does he have deeper issues. Not our problem, since he's a good bass player. <br /> <br />Anyway - it is an incredible DVD, and if you like the music of the Eagles, it belongs in your collection. The sound is superlative. The concert is rendered in both Dolby 5.1, and Stereo versions. But, be wary of the wanna-be audiophiles who talk about surround sound being everything. Remember, in a concert, the band is in front of you, and not around you. The stereo rendition of the concert is the only true one. As such the sound is engineered very well. Keep the bass turned a little low, and you'll see why the Eagles have lasted as long as they have, in a world of one-hit-wonders. Beautiful solos, especially the solo on \\"One day at a time\\". Joe Walsh has to be one of the most talented guitarists around. The interviews, and special features are pretty good too. On the whole - a very well put together production. Long live the Eagles!
B000066HI4|5.0|I'm an avid music fan.  I've listened to quite an array of rock and pop throughout my life and I can say without hesitation that this disc is unlike anything I've ever heard.  All of BPB's work is incredibly interesting.  He's taken folk and worked in blues, rock, country, all with undertones of both melancholy and joy.  In my opinion, this is his definitive work, the one you MUST have if you want to get the complete Bonnie Price Billy experience.  I must admit that I cannot listen to this stuff very often because it is such a strange, intense experience.  Every once in a while, an artist creates something beyond his medium.  Will Oldham has done that here.  This is more than music.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|The so-called Donner cut is an interesting version of the second film. <br />It fixes some of the major problems with the Lester cut: <br />1.  The three villains' crime seems to be the killing of a guard and <br />    breaking of a red stick; <br /> <br />2.  They were arrested, judged and sentenced within what couldn't have <br />    been more than ten minutes;  <br /> <br />3.  The sentencing is restaged without Jor-El when from the first movie  <br />    we know that he described the villains and was the deciding vote in <br />    the judgement against them;  <br /> <br />4.  The Max Fleischer-like cartoon that represented the distintegration <br />    of the phantom zone plate that incarcerated the three super villains <br />    and left shards of crystal in space;  <br /> <br />5.  Would Clark Kent really be smarmy and ask Lois about the sleeping  <br />    arrangements on their \\"honeymoon\\" assignment? <br /> <br />6.  The literal Freudian slip that has Clark accidentally put his hand  <br />    in the fire.  Lois thinks maybe it happened because he wanted it to <br />    happen.  Given that he can think at superhuman speed he must have  <br />    really really wanted it to happen.  So his \\"I don't know why I did  <br />    that\\" seems self-deluded. <br /> <br />7.  The levitation/tractor beam superpower eminating from the fingertips <br />    of General Zod; <br /> <br />8.  The magical red beam that allowed the three to change Mt Rushmore in <br />    mid-flight as they flew across the scene on the TV screen (if it had <br />    been heat vision they would have had to hover and carve the mountain); <br /> <br />9.  The special effects used to change Lon Chaney, Jr. into the Wolfman <br />    were far better than used on the deconstruction of Kal-El and the  <br />    transformation of Clark Kent from simply a secret identity to an  <br />    earthly man. Apparently the super suit was also transformed into  <br />    seventies fashion.  <br /> <br />10. The sudden unexplained regaining of Superman's powers (as big a  <br />    cop out as the turning back of time).  Whatever he did to get his <br />    super powers back also got him his super suit returned. <br /> <br />11. The amnesia kiss!  Where did that come from? <br /> <br />But while resolving some problems, this cut continues ones from the  <br />original movie and creates new ones.  Donner's vision of the Superman  <br />mythos is flawed: <br />1.  Both movies suffer from mysoginist tendencies. As good as Marlon <br />    Brando's scenes are, Susannah York should have been used more. <br /> <br />2.  There's a difference between comic relief and camp.  Donner seemed <br />    to prefer the latter.  The comic book Lex Luthor is a genius as  <br />    well as an ego maniac but he's a serious villain--physically and  <br />    mentally.  Power and revenge are all-consuming for him.  Gene  <br />    Hackman's Luthor is lazy, out of shape and always talking about how  <br />    smart he is but seldom acts that way.  He seems perfectly happy just <br />    putting down people of less than average intelligence.  How did he  <br />    expect to control the super villains? Should he have gotten some  <br />    green kryptonite? <br /> <br />3.  We are to believe that Kal-El has supercontrol of his orgasms so as <br />    not to kill Lois. <br /> <br />4.  After consummating his relationship with Lois, the scene with Kal-El <br />    (sans glasses in a white shirt and black trousers) pleading his case <br />    to Jor-El has some mighty bad acting by Christopher Reeve. <br /> <br />5.  If he's done it before, why doesn't he simply turn back time as soon <br />    as he gets his powers back.  It seems three super villains on a  <br />    killing spree is much more important than whether Lois remembers his <br />    identity or not.   <br /> <br />Michael Thau has done a remarkable job and provided us with a glimpse of <br />the direction the Donner film was heading.  But given the problems with  <br />this new cut, I wish Donner would have been given the opportunity to  <br />finish the film. Reshoots, alternate cuts, etc. would have made it a much <br />better film despite the camp.  The resolution to Lois's knowledge of  <br />Superman's secret identity would have been most certainly different,  <br />particularly because a repentant son would not go against the rule--it  <br />is strictly prohibited to interfere with human history--given to him by <br />his self-sacrificing Dad, a second time.   <br /> <br />IMO...Superman Returns is a much better film than the Donner/Lester <br />films.  And despite, the lukewarm reception that Brandon Routh has  <br />received, he seems much more believable as Superman/Clark Kent than  <br />anyone since Kirk Alyn.  The thing is that Superman Returns would have  <br />been very different if Clark and Lois had never been intimate in the  <br />second film. <br /> <br />
0321213351|5.0|I've looked over some of the other reviews on here and disagree with much of the criticism. This book is very easy to navigate and use and a book that will help teach you patterns in a most practical way, by helping you find which pattern to apply to improve bad code when you need it. I've used this book frequently to find better solutions to bits of code that I just know could be improved and have expanded my knowledge of patterns in the process in a way that I never could by picking up a book on Design Patterns and studying them. If you enjoy learning in a hands on way, I think you will come to learn patterns and improve your code by having this book on hand at your desk to turn to. The patterns listed in this book are the ones that Software Engineers can use on a daily/frequent basis. These are patterns an Engineer should know well enough to just apply to code when they see the need has arisen. I think this book is very useful to Engineers who would like to learn software well enough to just be able to crank out good code when addressing daily problems.

B000244FDW|5.0|Each year at Christmas I read P&P, my favorite book and I remember when Masterpiece Theater ran this for the first time in the 80's.  I fell in love with it, not because it was a great visual masterpiece, but because it is true to the book.  The dialogue is almost totally the same as the book.  There is only one small section, when the girls go to meet the youngest after she marries that is left out of this version.  This movie has not been souped up to show Colin Firth getting out of a pool naked, etc.  It is six hours long.  For those who are true lovers of the book, this is the best.  When I watch the other versions I see only Hollywood trying to sell what it thinks we all want to see and not the way the book truly comes across.   <br />Just remember when watching this version that you are watching a book made into a movie, not a movie loosely based on a book.  This version is charming and while it will never get an Academy Award, Jane Austen would I think be very pleased with it. <br />Oh, don't bother with the version from the 40's.  I began watching it and it is set in the 1840's and made out to be like a Dicken's story.  It's way too far off base.
B00005JPGM|5.0|MOVIE: Edward Zwick's films always strike a good chord with me because of their incredible emotional impact. The Last Samurai left such a grand impact on me that I was in tears at its incredible and emotional climax. The Blood Diamond does the same thing by establishing strong central characters with a clear objective that makes the film gripping and tense. The story revolves around Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) a local fisherman whose village is raided by local militia who are at civil war over the control over the diamond fields. These events took place in the late 90's and it serves as the backdrop of the film. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian smuggler who works for a corporate diamond company in London he also works as a mercenary. He smuggles diamonds to the corporations so that they can remove them off of the market thus keeping supply low and demand high, that way they spike the prices. After Vendi is removed from his village and his family separated, he is put to work in the diamond fields where he comes across a pink diamond so rare that it could change the fate of not only his life but a nation's. Vandy is able to escape his imprisonment by the rebels but is put in prison by the police, and in prison he meets Danny Archer who now wants to set his sights on the hidden diamond. When Archer meets Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist, she believes that his story holds the key to revealing the truth behind the diamond corporations.  When Vandy's son is recruited by the rebels he sets out on a quest to find his son while Archer wants the diamond so that he can leave Africa and start his troubled life over. Arnold Vosloo plays a general who is also after the diamond. So we have four people after one small stone for four different reasons.<br /><br />The film has many sides to it. At times it's a dark look into the social and economical conflicts of Africa, sometimes it becomes a burning commentary on the nature of man, but overall this film is an intimate story of three characters placed within the setting. The main objective of the film is to tell the story of the characters where as in films like Tears Of The Sun or Black Hawk Down it's more about sending a central message. I'm not saying the latter films are bad, I enjoyed Tears Of The Suns and Black Hawk Down immensely. I'm also not saying that Blood Diamond is not trying to send a central message either. It's just that Blood Diamond really tries to tell a story, just like Zwick did with The Last Samurai. While the film portrayed a civil struggle in Japan it was more focused on Tom Cruise's and Ken Watanabe's characters so that when tragedy struck it had a strong emotional impact on the audience. Blood Diamond is not only emotional but it's incredibly tense and thrilling. There is lots of action in the film and the final air raid was executed perfectly. The story is solid and the film is an immense accomplishment. The reason why I knocked off half a star from my final rating was that I had two minor problems with the movie. There were places where a few tweaks could have heightened the emotional impact of the film and have kept the pace of the film more consistent. However, it is whithout a doubt that the film was superbly edited. The pace and structure were very consistant and strong. I was pleased by the script, Charles Leavitt did a fine job with the screenplay even though he has taken a long break from writing since his last effort with K-Pax. The second thing that bothered me was that once the movie ends and the credits start to roll we are hit with this hardcore rap song. I was absolutely shocked and disapointed with the decision to use rap in the end credits, it ruined the lasting effect of the film within a split second.<br /><br />The film also displays some incredible artistic efforts. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. There is a very good chance that Eduardo Serra should be one of the directors of photography nominated this year at the Oscars. Some of the shots were truly breathtaking and of course you have to give credit to beautiful landscapes of Africa. The film's score was composed by James Newton Howard who relied heavily on African vocals for the amazing score. I have to mention here that Hans Zimmer is the pioneer of incorporating native sounds into a film's score based on location. Zimmer made African vocals his speciality with films like A World Apart, The Power Of One, The Lion King, and Tears Of The Sun. You have to acknowledge the Zimmer style in the score, but James Newton Howard makes it completely his own and delivers an amazing score.

Some of the shots were truly breathtaking and of course you have to give credit to beautiful landscapes of Africa. The film's score was composed by James Newton Howard who relied heavily on African vocals for the amazing score. I have to mention here that Hans Zimmer is the pioneer of incorporating native sounds into a film's score based on location. Zimmer made African vocals his speciality with films like A World Apart, The Power Of One, The Lion King, and Tears Of The Sun. You have to acknowledge the Zimmer style in the score, but James Newton Howard makes it completely his own and delivers an amazing score.

B000GPI2EK|4.0|If anyone is actually expecting this to sound like Mars Volta, then learn how to read, this is Metal, brohams. This ground and pound, gut busting, face melting, power stance, bang your head metal. Yeah, it has a guy from Mars Volta, doesn't mean anything. Even Homme from QOTSA is on here and it doesn't make a difference. This is real metal and if you want to rock out then spend the money to do it in style. It's got real cajones, something that I can't say that often nowadays but I'm glad I can throw the term around every once in a while when it comes to a band like Mastodon and an album like Blood Mountain.
B00005N6KG|4.0|My only gripe with these wonderful headphones (and other similar models) are that the wires at both ends eventually go bad at 3-6 months of really heavy use (I'm pretty ruthless with my equipment).  Otherwise, I can't say enough good things about these -- the cord is of ample lenght, fits in your ears well, fits your heads well, good sound range, low profile, goes well with the black ipod.  Its too bad these aren't available at more places, but they are very reasonably priced at Amazon.  I'm scared they will be discontinued at some point -- I'd be crushed.  Four stars for the flaw at with the wire connection at both ends.
0446615625|2.0|It has been mentioned by MANY others already, but I had to voice my displeasure of the book. <br /> <br />The plot has so many forced twists and suprises it takes away from some pretty intersting parts of the books.  1/2 of them are pointless to the story, it seems like Baldacci just couldn't help himself from adding 1 more twist.  Then he could help himself again.  7 twists later the book ends. <br /> <br />Also, some things are just not plausible even for this type of book genre.  I can't give it away but for those who read it - it could never happen. <br /> <br />This is my first Baldacci book.  Others have said his earlier works are good, but it will be a while before I go back to him, if ever

Strictly reviewing the movie, it was well done (although I could have used the occasional relief of \\"their is still hope\\" a little more often!) and not at all a snoozer.   <br /> <br />If you think this is just about Gore trying to win himself the presidency, I recommend you go back to school and get an education about the subject.

And you know it is good:  adventure, action, escape, burdens, lost loves, and survival under harsh circumstances.  This is a mix of Robinson Caruso and The Count of Monte Cristo (while Dante is in prison).<br /><br />Federal Express manager Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is shipwrecked for four years.  This story related to his life before, during, and after.  And believe it or not, at the very end, I'll bet you will be wondering about the next chapter as well.<br /><br />Cast Away is a movie investment... you'll want to see it about every third year.
B000002AGN|5.0|Dave Brubeck was in Houston for a concert last night, and we were listening to this album on the way there. A classic album, a classic artist. Though there was no Paul Desmond at the concert, it was fantastic to finally get to hear Dave in person.<br /><br />It's hard to pick a favorite tune from this album, as they are all wonderful to listen to. \\"Take Five\\", the main hit from this album, sounds great on this remastered version, and it sounded amazing as his 85 year old hands tickled the ivories at the concert. Bobby Militello filled in well and amply for Paul Desmond on sax at the performance, by the way.<br /><br />In addition to \\"Take Five\\" and \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk\\", I also enjoy \\"Kathy's Waltz\\" and \\"Everybody's Jumpin'\\", with the Sax lead opening and Dave's piano answering, and the following exchange and counter point.<br /><br />Also, if you have not heard any of Dave Brubeck's choral arrangements, I would highly recommend them. They were played last night with the Dave Brubeck quartet, the Houston Chamber Choir and a brass section. Simply amazing. You can find them on his albums \\"The Gates of Justice\\" and \\"To Hope\\".
0446678430|3.0|Many know that I am (proudly) an advocate of the teachings of Kiyosaki.  However, that does not mean he can get off without some constructive criticism every now and then as I see it.<br /><br />First the positive: Retire Young - Retire Rich (RY-RR) is an solid (but not necessarily essential) component of the RDPD series of books/products.  Within RY-RR one will review the key components of his prevous books and add to the base the important role of leverage and how it accelerates one's goal of becoming financially independent/wealthy.  As I have stated in previous reviews, he begins his books after RDPD with a sound review of previous lessons and fundamentals and ends with new thoughts/introductions to new concepts.  Within RY-RR leverage is applied/incorporated to the teachings of the first three books of his RDPD series and when combined - accelerates wealth-building.  Specifically, he introduces an explanation  (backed by sound references - primarily by government sources) of the passive-portfolio income levels. Second, he discusses in-depth that retiring young and rich is not about thinking differently, but thinking the opposite of how the poor and middle class think.  Next, in Section III (until the end), he goes into the leverage of passive and portfolio income strategies that will accelerate one's goal of becoming financially independent while you're still young enough to enjoy it.<br /><br />However, there are flaws.  This book, if you read the first three books in the series (and maybe the fourth, which I don't consider in my reviews because of the target audience, which I am not a part of) will be slow - Sections I and II were forced reads.  One may find the need to read hoping to catch every gem of wisdom and thought of a powerful force in the finance/investment world (Kiyoaski), but may find it slow.  Having read the first few books in the series, the power and discussion of leverage may seem a bit late - either because you know about it and/or discovered it if you are an action-oriented reader.  Also, I agree that the concept of leverage is important - it is a KEY ingredient to beooming financially successful and independent.  This book would have been better placed within RDPD and CFQ with Section III being incorporated within Rich Dad's 'Guide to Investing.'<br /><br />Now if you are only a casual reader of investing and finance then let me disclaim and insert a spoiler: Read pg. 104 and you have what you're looking for.  But if you really want to continue in building your millionaire mindset influenced by Kiyosaki - read the entire book and have fun with Section III.<br /><br />The good news as the reviewer of this book is that Kiyosaki stands firm and I believe in his concepts because they are many of the concepts I utilize in my investments.  Furthermore, a financial paradigm shift is a on-going process.  Sometimes redunancy is good - but again, in this particular book, it goes on too long. Allow me to give you some key points to focus on:<br />- Serving more and more people with less and less effort<br />- Adhearing to and following your plan even during times of disappointment<br />- Conepts of shorts, puts, and options - don't gloss over this: If you are a \\"doer\\" in this section, you may disagree with Kiyosaki points (some of which I do), but the concepts are well-explained in lay terms.<br /><br />Bottomline: Is RY-RR essential reading in the Kioyaski series?  The answer is \\"no,\\" plain and simple.  Is it worth the read?  To use one of Kiyosaki's favorite phrases: \\"It depends.\\"  It depends on where you are financially, your knowledge base, and your understanding and application of his previous work.  But just as important: It depends on your patience to get through the first two sections of the book and overcoming what I am confident will be a shared opinion: Your willingness to hear the same message again with the topic of leverage appearing two books too late.<br /><br />Oh - least we all forget: Kiyosaki, as of the placement and order of this book within his series, does not give you a blueprint.  So, if you're reading hoping that it's written with concrete steps of how to reach the affluent-super rich categories then don't buy - I will argue that you will be disappointed almost with every book written by him.  But if you seeking fundamentals and looking to increase your knowledge level and expand on the mind-set format of which he writes for a practical $18.00 value - you may enjoy (all points considered in the review above).ok within his series, does not give you a blueprint.

0688170528|3.0|The first Jodi Picoult book I read was \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" and it blew me away.  Since then I have ready many more of her books with a 50/50 result.  Liked \\"Salem Falls,\\" hated \\"The Tenth Circle,\\" etc.  I gave \\"The Pact\\" three stars only because it was very readable and I could not put it down, but ultimately was very disappointed.  I am finding several ongoing problems with this author's books: <br />1. Parents in her novels are almost always clueless, dysfunctional, self-absorbed, and/or just plain stupid.  I realize teenagers can be hard to read (I have two), but it's difficult for me to believe that the parents in \\"The Pact\\" can be this out of it.  Example:  one of the fathers comes home and finds his young (13 or so) daughter making out with the neighbor's son, and his reaction is to quietly go away because this is want the two sets of parents had wanted all along.  Hello?  Any parent I know would have turned the lights on and sent the boy home.  I found the whole idea that the parents basically planned for these kids to be together from the time they were born to be fairly creepy. <br />2.  The son, Chris, is portrayed as extremely intelligent and caring, yet he knows that his girlfriend, Emily, is suicidal and tells no one.  Again, hard to believe, as several other reviewers have pointed out. <br />3.  Ms. Picoult often just does not know how to end her books.  The ending of this one was a case in point...utterly unbelievable, implausible, and unsatisfying, leaving me wanting to throw the book across the room.  There is just no way that a jury would have ruled the way they did in this case.  The ending of \\"Keeping Faith,\\" was another one that had me confused.  Please, Ms. Picoult, I realize that life does not always result in neat and tidy endings, but give us something!!!!  These are novels, after all. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I like the way this author writes but am often sorry that I took the time to read the book.  I would like to read \\"Plain Truth\\" asI saw the movie and this seems to be a book that everyone really seems to like, but that will probably be the last Jodi Picoult novel for me. Sorry, but I'm done.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|The original issue of this album on CD was lacking on a couple of levels.  The track list was cut to squeeze it onto one disc and the recording was dumped without any remastering.  Some albums do quite well without retouching, but this particular recording suffered from either bad equalization, too much compression, or a combination of both.  The remastered edition takes care of both problems.  The track list from the original album is restored and the remastering job does much to bring this otherwise challenged concert to life.  The performance is impeccable of course.  Some songs that are somewhat laid back in their studio versions get the \\"live\\" treatment in a big way.  The condensed version of Thick as a Brick used to feel a little short, but the way they punch out its boiled down essence has grown on me over time.  Another highlight is the updated take on A New Day Yesterday which sounds heavier and much more serious than the studio version.  There are plenty of moments like this throughout the album.  Jethro Tull was a force to be reckoned with in their time and an album like this is a great snapshot of a band in their prime.

0321344758|5.0|This book is a must read when it comes to web usability. It is not very long and an easy read in one afternoon. It covers all major design elements and provides good examples to visualize the issues and solutions for them. That fact makes this book a good read for anybody who is involved in any aspect of a websites operation, Web Developer, Marketing, Sales and Management (from mid level to upper level).<br /><br />Most of the tips about how to go about things like testing etc. are very practical and can be adapted to any project quickly.<br /><br />The book does not address in detail conflicts between pure usability and other aspects like search engine optimization, development processes etc.<br /><br />I recommend to get additional material for those issues.

I lost the interest, Because most the movie was slow Pasted! I was accepting like spiderman series, type a high tank action, but was way to far, they push the damn love story to it to much makes it more drama then comic action hero flick!!!!!!!!!!Anyway not all that. I guess just a rental worth and seen just once, nothing more C+
B000683VI4|4.0|The Notebook is a movie to give hope to the idea that people can still be in love when they are old. It is a tale of true love that never gives up, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, and in youth or old age. The love that Noah and Allie share clearly would convince anyone that true love will last the test of time. A movie with this message is needed at a time like this, when people fall in and out of love all the time and hardly believe in love. It gives hope, joy, and expectancy of true love.
B00081H018|4.0|Thus you should like it or dislike it depending on whether or not you enjoy psychological, steady-paced, well-plotted mysteries, such as those by P.D. James and Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine).  People who want a speedy, thrilling, more violent page turner like the Alex Delaware books, may be in for a disappointment (which I believe is reflected in many comments here).  I do like the Delaware books (though I confess my favorite characters are Milo Sturgis and the city of Los Angeles; I find Dr. Delaware often whiny and Robin a total you-know-what -- and I'm female), but I liked this one as well.  It's just different, that's all.  To me the central mystery wasn't about the serial killer, it was about the Conspiracy Club, and whether or not they were actually steering the psychologist protagonist, or perhaps he instead is losing it emotionally and mentally.  Is he being persecuted by the police, set up by the Club (for good or ill), set up by the killer, or just insane?  The medical references, often involving cancers, surgeries, and serious activities (Tumor Boards, the Morbidity and Mortality Boards, etc.) to me added an ominous, building sense of inexorable tension to the atmosphere of the story.  Very finely done.  I couldn't wait to see what happened...the best recommendation for any story.  If you're looking for a roller coaster thrill ride, however, you should probably wait for another Delaware book.
B00003CXTG|1.0|A film based on one of America's darkest hours, Pearl Harbor, is not one of any true value. The plot consists more of a crappy love story, then of any historical importance. Even with its strong supporting cast including Ben Affleck, Josh Hartinett, Jenifer Garner, and Kate Beckinsale; the story's poor character development and uncaptivating performances hinder enjoyment of the film. If I had to pick some decent part in the film, I would have   to  say it's when they show the devotion of the troops to defend the country after the attack, and near the end when the bombing run of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is shown. Other than that this film is nothing more than a waste of time and money.
B00005JPBP|4.0|Christopher Nolan's \\"The Prestige\\" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation -  a tale of two master magicians in turn-of-the-century London whose bitter rivalry leads to deception, dismemberment and eventually murder.<br /><br />Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are two up-and-coming magicians who part ways when Alfred is deemed to be partly responsible for the death of Robert's beloved wife (while functioning as a magician's assistant) in one of their acts on stage.  Consumed with the desire for revenge and spurred on by professional jealousy, Robert spends the remainder of his days working to undermine and destroy Alfred's career and life.<br /><br />With the help of some first-rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co-writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel.  The solid production values - meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography - offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core.  More than anything else, the film is a tribute to the stagecraft inherent in the art of magic making.  The movie provides not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight-of-hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi-level time structure and its I-never-saw-that-coming, turnabout ending.<br /><br />The performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.<br /><br />On the slightly negative side, the film might have been more successful had it remained entirely in the realm of the real world of magic making and resisted the temptation of turning to science fiction to help move its plot along.  Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment.rtainment.
B00000272N|5.0|Although lumped into the Grunge genre, AIC's debut makes them stand apart from their fellow Seattle peers of that era.  Although it has an '80's \\"guitar album\\" feel  more akin to Van Halen or some of George Lynch's work, it is full of the imagery, tempos, and vocal styles that became AIC staples.  There are sludgy, gloom songs (Bleed the Freak, It Ain't Like That, Confusion, Love-Hate-Love, I Can't Remember) but there are also shredders and up-tempo songs, as well (Can't Put You Down, I Know Something).  Not to be forgotten is the radio hit \\"Man in the Box\\" or the now-prophetic drug song \\"The Real Thing,\\" a taste of things to come from the \\"Dirt\\" album and a view into the problems that would plague the band clear up to Layne Staley's tragic death in 2002.  Several of these songs were staples in the 2006 tour and rightfully so...you must have this album!

This shows that we all have different tastes in music.  <br /> <br />This CD's music selection is creative and fabulous.  The song Awake is beautiful, and should have been on the regular CD too. For that, the CD/DVD is a great buy.  I love the DVD.

The shift from \\"Book of Secrets\\" is subtle and becomes more apparent after repeated listening.

B000J10ERO|4.0|I must admit, I only have a working knowledge of Superman.  I haven't seen the previous movies or the various TV shows.  Still, I know who all the characters are and was quite anxious to see this movie.  While that means I missed out of some cool cameos, I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />For five years, the world has been without Superman (Brandon Routh).  Now, he's come back to Earth and is ready to pick up where he left off.<br /><br />Fortunately, his alter ego, Clark Kent, is able to get his old job back at The Daily Planet.  While Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is thrilled to see him back, his reunion with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is very chilly.  During the last five years, she's moved on with her life.  She has a son (Tristan Lake Leabu) and is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden).  Seeing Superman again stirs up old feelings within her, so she's not exactly thrilled to be assigned to cover him again.<br /><br />Meanwhile, old nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has just been released from prison.  He's already planning his next bid for world domination.  It involves crystals, kryptonite, and creating land.  Will Superman figure out what he's up to in time to stop him?<br /><br />The movie is two and a half hours long, and unfortunately it feels it.  The first part of the movie is very slow with back story even this newbie didn't need.  Once the story got going, it was interesting and held my interest through the end, which again dragged on for a scene or two more then necessary.<br /><br />Much has been made of casting an unknown in the roll.  I liked Brandon Routh in the lead.  He has a commanding presence as Superman.  Kevin Spacey was great as well.  His Luthor was equal parts fun and menace.  The only real problem was Kate Bosworth.  She did a great job, but she looked too young for the part.  For this story to work, the actress playing Lois needed to be at least thirty, and Kate isn't.<br /><br />And, of course, there are the special effects, which are incredible and flawlessly fit into the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie, but not the great movie I had hoped it would be.which are incredible and flawlessly fit into the film. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good movie, but not the great movie I had hoped it would be.

B00005BCK6|3.0|If you are choosing which volumes to keep, this one falls under the \\"nice to have but not essential\\" category.  In the first episode, we get a comical episode as \\"Koirck\\" and then Spock attempt to pass themselves off as old-time Chicago-style gangsters with extremely humourous results.  The plot is admittedly far-fetched and full of holes and yet this is what adds to the humour of the episode which is never meant to be taken too seriously.  Overall a slightly above average episode.<br /><br />The second episode is also humourous although it is a little less so when compared with the first.  Aliens hell-bent on subduing the members of the Enterprise end up having to deal with human style sensations which ultimately results in their undoing.  It is precisely the way the Enterprise crew and especially Spock's role in making the Kelvan commander jealous is what makes this episode really funny.<br /><br />In conclusion, this volume contains two above average episodes which nevertheless fall far short from the heights achieved on other Season 1 episodes.
0618680004|3.0|I would never fly in a 747 that Richard Dawkins is piloting any more than I would read a book on molecular biology authored by the pope. So why does this highly intelligent man write a book well outside his understanding? The better question, is why would anyone read it?<br /><br />He is right in only one small respect. The irrational behavior of fundamentalists, whether Muslim or Christian, have poisoned logic and defy reason. But for the majority of religious people, grasping the intangible and realizing the existence of a power beyond the scope of their limited human reason is amazingly probable. While at the same time these same religious people can and do comprehend evolution, String Theory, and the Big Bang.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is no theologian and his views on God and religion are so obtuse and oversimplified they are as wrong as the fundamentalists he rails against. How ironic.
0060977493|1.0|I found this book to be a real disappointment. Overall, I think this woman needed to edit and revise her book. The characters were not people that I would ever want to spend time with and the plot was twisted around. At the end, I sat and figured out how the story happened, in order, but I don't think a writer should ever require so much work on the part of the reader for something that is just basic structure. Also, there was a lot of meaningless description that didn't move the story forward. I am sad that I paid money for this book and the only thing I can think of that would help me get my moneys worth at this point would be to use it to heat my home this winter! I gave one star because of the wonderful book that could have been, if she had revised a few times.   If you want to read good stories, skip this and go buy Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies.    Edited review on February 12, 2008   Well, it's a couple years later and this still stands as the worst book I've ever read. My husband didn't believe me that it could really be as bad as I said it was, so he read it. To make a long story short, at the end he insisted that we follow through with burning it, which we did.  This is the only book I've ever set fire to. It was just THAT bad.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|I admit I've never been a fan of re-mix albulms so I'm not surprised this albulm does not appeal to me.  Until now I've been fairly pleased with the products that have come out during the past decade to keep making money off of the Beatles, but not this one.  I borrowed it from a friend to listen to before I bought it.  Thank God I did because I saved myself $12-15. <br /> <br />I hate to criticize anything by the Beatles, but really this isn't their fault.  Now I just have to hope no one gets me this for Christmas.
B00005JPCD|3.0|But then the eco-warriors show up.  Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hugh Jackman, Brittany Murphy, and Nicole Kidman head up the cast of \\"Happy Feet.\\"  It all starts innocently enough.  A young penguin is born \\"different\\" and instead of having a song in his heart, it lands in his feet.  He's treated as an outcast and eventually gets lost during a first swim.  He runs into a group of Latino penguins (headed up by Williams) who show him that being different isn't all that bad.<br /><br />Then the story takes a dark, preachy turn.  **SPOILERS**  Our young hero finds out that evil aliens (humans) are taking all of the fish from his family's lands.  He sets out to stop them and ends up in a zoo, where he loses his song.  Eventually, he finds hope in the eyes of a child and just by dancing tilts the world on its axis and makes the big, bad fishing companies end all fishing!<br /><br />Unbelieveable, PETA-like propaganda, and a rather boring story make for a very dull adult viewing experience.  My daughter loved the parts where all of the cutesy-wutesy penguins danced, but became somewhat terrified by the \\"evil\\" of the humans.  It's amazing at how great the lengths were for this film to preach to the masses.  It's funny how they decided to teach their propaganda to a group of children at an age when they are most easily influenced.  This film would have been great if they had kept the atmosphere light.  Instead, they tried to push off their propaganda on the crowd.  Folks, I don't know about you, but when I want to be preached to, I go to church.<br /><br />One thing that amazed me was how they tried so hard to make man look evil for stealing all of the fish, yet no one spoke up for the fish in the film.  Also, why did that seal have to look so vicious?  I thought tree-huggers and the anti-fur crowd hated it when baby seals are clubbed to death.  In this flick, if any seal deserved a good clubbing, it was the one after our little hero.<br /><br />Others have stated that the music used in this film was sex-laden.  Yes, it was, but I don't think that was as much of an obvious thing to the kiddies as was the \\"man bad, nature good\\" sermon.  Also, I can see where many viewers saw a connection between Mumbles being different and a person being gay.  I also picked up on the whole anti-Christian bit, but it seemed as more of an attack on Catholicism in particular than Christianity as a whole.<br /><br />This was the first film that I've walked out of in a long time angry.  I felt cheated out of my money in order to hear how horrible man is.  I'll give it three stars since the animation was wonderful and the kids really loved the \\"dancing penguin\\" aspect of this film.  Otherwise, you'd be just as happy watching \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" as you would this propaganda-laden drivel.<br /><br />Not recommended.at the music used in this film was sex-laden.

006112429X|5.0|Nature or nurture? We all ask that question as we watch our kids grow and develop. But what if your child ends up committing a crime so heinous that there can be no satisfying answers? As the mother of \\"Kevin\\" strives to understand his actions in retrospect through a series of written letters, she brutally dissects herself, her marriage and Kevin's personality and upbringing with a starkness and honesty rarely seen in any literature. This book is not for the faint of heart (Kevin's antics are more than upsetting) and Kevin's father's unrelenting and unquestioning support of his clearly disturbed young son is enough to drive anyone mad. Shriver pulls these characters off beautifully...without blame, villains, heroes, apologies...or answers.
0156027321|5.0|I had seen this book on the books shelf and thought about getting it, but how original or interesting could a boy adrift at sea with a tiger be?  After reading a short review in Esquire praising this book I decided that I would finally read it, leading to a prompt cessation of all prodcutive activites in my life until after I had read the last words.  The narrator is a young boy whose parents own a circus that they decide to bring to North America, but a storm at sea sinks the boat, leaving only the narrator (Pi) and a few animals alive adrift a small life boat. However, Pi quickly loses the company of most of his animal companions to the appetite of the tiger who reamins the closest thing to company that Pi retains during his time adrift at sea.  The narrator also discusses his spiritual journeys devlving into some explicit discussions regarding religion and philosophy, but make no mistake: this is not same philsophy you got from the ramblings of a pipe-smoking college professor in a tweed coat.  Martel has shown with this book that a story about a boy adrift in a boat with tiger can be original, entertaining, and profoundly moving.
B000I5X824|4.0|It is kind of unique to realise that Staind has been around for pretty much 10 years since forming together as a band in the middle of 1996 with their first release 'Tormented'. During the last 10 years, Staind has evolved as a band, their music and individually as band members. It is great to see and hear Aaron Lewis' voice gather momentum and expand in range and emotional strength. For me 'Break The Cycle' was their best album with many songs becoming hits in their own right. There are several songs in this 'The Singles' release that are included.<br /><br />1 song from Tormented, 'Come Again'<br /><br />2 songs from Dysfunction, 'Mudshovel' & 'Home'<br /><br />The first surprise of this album comes on track 4 which includes a Live version with Fred Durst of 'Outside' which is a better version than the album version. Fred Durst and Aaron Lewis sound great together and have a complex but good chemistry together.<br /><br />5 songs from Break The Cycle, 'It's Been Awhile', 'For You', 'Epiphany' and 'So Far Away.<br /><br />2 songs from Shades of Grey, 'Price To Play' & 'Zoe Jayne'.<br /><br />2 songs from Chapter V, 'Right Here Waiting' & 'Falling'.<br /><br />At the end of this album is what most fans will enjoy the most. 'Everything Changes' is sung by Lewis acoustically live in concert and his talented voice ranges far and very well acoustically. For me I enjoy acoustic Staind songs better. The final three songs are acoustically sung cover songs including 'Sober', 'Comfortably Numb' and 'Nutshell'. These three songs are a pleasure to listen with the sound turned up.<br /><br />Overall this is a appealing album. It is definitely not the 'Best Of' but is a compilation of the well known singles of Staind with some added tossers that all Staind fans will love and truly appreciate.
0679731725|5.0|I watched the movie starring Emma Thompson and Sir Anthony Hopkins several years ago - long enough ago that I didn't remember anything but servants scuttling about in an old British manor. Now that I've read this excellent novel, I'll need to rent the movie again and see if I like it better. Ishiguro unwraps the main character, Stevens, in a first person narrative that draws in the reader in a most wonderful fashion. His descriptions of his driving vacation through English countryside make the reader wish for an open car and a few days to ramble to your heart's content. The further Stevens drives, the more deep his introspection delves until he's finally able to see things much differently than he had previously done.
B000I5X81A|5.0|These guys go together like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells. Five stars just for the song, \\"When This War Is Over,\\" dedicated to Bushie and the gang of squatters in the White House that got us into this colossal mess! Cale and Clapton shine; one of the best albums out lately. Thanks, guys!
0743289412|3.0|Lisey's Story, unfortunately, reads to me like a poor man's Bag Of Bones. The plots are similar: widow/widower grieving beloved spouse, who is attempting contact from beyond the grave, with some unresolved issues that are, of course, supernatural in nature. But as is usually the case, it's King's writing that saves the day. His characters are especially vibrant here, and though the plot will seem rehashed to Constant Readers, it's entertaining enough to keep you in the game. I don't regret this read. Even though it feels very familiar, it's like a great stretch of road in a different season - sometimes you notice different things in a different light.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock works wonders in relating what the actual movie audience does -- sit in a theater and watch events unfold througout a narrative sequence -- by portraying that in his film \\"Rear Window.\\" <br /> <br />Through the eyes of Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart), we see the events that lead up to the suspicion of a murder that happens across his courtyard. He sees the events unfold through the window of his apartment, just as we see them on the movie screen. <br /> <br />Hitchcock uses suspense, point of view and camera angles to suck the audience into his own little movie world, with just a little voyueristic flair thrown in.
B0007M22TI|2.0|I've just watched this on PBS (through my fingers, shaking my head in frustration.  The \\"Celtic Woman\\" gals' obviously canned voices are clear (if miserably overproduced), sweet, and pleasant; several of them apparently have already had successful careers as musicians, so I don't doubt that the voices one hears on the DVD actually belong to them.   <br /> <br />But that being said (and I'm trying to be balanced and diplomatic here), the producers of the show have done them a major disservice by dubbing previous performance recordings over this video footage -- what an insult to their musicianship to insinuate that they can't handle a live performance!  Think of how much better this would have been with these five beauties simply singing, without all the Vegas/Cirque-du-Soleil/Chorus Line business going on in the background! <br /> <br />I also have to ask -- in what universe is \\"You Raise Me Up\\" a Celtic song?  People, Celtic music has a long, rich history -- surely they didn't have to record this cheeseball popera hit to pander to the masses...
B000I5X81K|5.0|\\"I am not a hero, I am not an angel...\\", yes, Josh, that may be true, but you sound like one on \\"In Her Eyes\\" and the rest of the songs on this stupendous new CD.  Josh's artistic integrity is magnificent. The entire production is fabulous. For my taste, the most spectacular and absolutely the BEST intuitive music support I have ever heard on any artist's CD is the spot-on  \\"Now or Never\\" with Imogen Heap whose \\"less is more\\" arrangement of \\"clock works\\" sound FX and synth drive behind Josh's glorious voice is fantastic.  Like all of \\"the ladies\\" that Josh refers to on his DVD edition, I too adore \\"February Song\\".  The words just latch onto your heartstrings because they are so sweet and the melody is so pretty and Josh can showcase his magnificent range. Josh really understands song composition, how to deliver the lyrics and is so good on piano and drums in several of his songs.  Josh truly is a total package artist.      Another brilliant mention for this entire CD is that Josh stretches himself as an artist and increases his repertoire of song types he can sing with such seeming effortlessness.  More, he has the self assured maturity and humility, that accompanies ALL of the greatest artists, to give credit to others in the production effort who deserve it. In this case special props to his singing coach. Totally Classy.    I love that on the CD/DVD edition there are two more songs: \\"Verita\\" and \\"Awake\\" the CD title cut. \\"Awake\\" in particular is delivered with great mastery and authority. Josh's voice is exquisite and his tone is perfection.  I am in awe. I particularly love Josh's brilliant jazz collaboration with Herbie Hancock on \\"Machine\\". It is a song that makes you stand up and start groovin'.    And lastly, for this review at least, is Josh's powerful delivery of the two songs \\"Lullaby and Weeping\\" back to back.  \\"Gets you in the gut\\", for sure!  What a beautiful way to raise consciousness. In my humble opinion this is Josh's best work to date of all he has recorded, his voice has matured and has become even richer and more textured.  Josh has a transcendently beautiful voice. Josh and this CD is absolute perfection to my ears. I'm still in awe.
B000I0QL82|4.0|This is really one of Bing's best movies with lots of song and dance. I highly recommend it......HOWEVER.....please remember that remastered DOES NOT mean restored. This movie needs to be restored !!....on a 52\\" DLP HD TV is is not crisp and clear. There is a certain amount of \\"fuzziness\\" to the picture. We bought the Special Edition version and I am disappointed that it is not a real clear picture. We have other restored movies that are very crisp and clear. I just wish the studios would spend some money and RESTORE the movie before they remaster it.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|This CD is beyond words. The beginning with BECAUSE sounds like a celestial choir ocapella and only gets better. As pretty as the song BECAUSE is in original form, it becomes a hymn on this CD. The random cutting and splicing of ALL the Beatles music is a fabulos montage of the group effort on one CD. This is THE MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, this is a walk through STRAWBERRY FIELDS, this is what was on the other side of ABBEY ROAD. Sir George Martin and son have out did themselves in preserving the greatness, grandness, lightness and frivolity that was the Beatles. It's very similar to YOU KNOW MY NAME, LOOK UP MY NUMBER, yet 1000 times better. From the mix of GOLDEN SLUMBERS and Ringo singing a sad sounding OCTOPUS'S GARDEN to strains of PENNY LANE,NORWEGIAN WOOD this CD is without match in sound quality, richness in substance to a compilation never before produced and never will again. I say thanks to Sir George and son for their work of \\"LOVE\\".
B0006HXXBA|4.0|I have been listening to Kreator since the eponymous \\"Coma of Souls\\", but hadn't heard much from them for the last few years. It seems that since the resurgence in metal's popularity began a couple of years ago, many of the old classic thrash bands have made a comeback- some still seem to have it, some don't.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, \\"Enemy of God\\" proves that Kreator does. The German metallers were one of the first \\"mega-heavy\\" bands which really got me into heavier styles of music. Nihilistic, abrasive, intense and heavy as hell, Kreator are relentless and brutal, and this excellent new comeback release proves that they still hold their own in a genre now full of bands trying to emulate what they were doing almost twenty years ago. The disturbing artwork and clever album title are worth a tip of the hat, as well. Recommended.
B000002JSJ|3.0|I'm a huge Zep fan and this one rarely gets played.  Supposedly, the strongest material on this album is Achilles Last Stand and Nobody's Fault but Mine.  Achilles is a 10+ minute song that feels about four minutes too long.  John Bonham's drumming is spectacular but otherwise a decent guitar riff gets repetitive.  Nobody's Fault is one of the most overrated Zep songs ever.  Die hard fans love it but it does nothing for me.  The best tune here, for my money, is the bluesy Tea For One.  Everything else is listenable but nothing here ranks with Zep's best work.  If you're new to Zep and want to move beyond compilations, buy any of their studio albums besides this one.
B00003CX95|5.0|I never though i would be able to isolate my favourite film of all time but upon seeing Braveheart my mind was firmly made up.  This film has everything a person could ask for, romance, action, drama topped off by fantastic performances and a terrific score.  A real gut stirrer of a film and recommended for all.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|This movie is absolutely beautiful. I am not even going to go on about Edward Norton's performance-he is my favorite actor anyway ever since the \\"Primar Fear\\". I was pleasantly surprised how a fresh-faced teen Jessica Biel gave such a solid performance of an aristocratic lady. She has done an amazing job. Paul Giamatti's character offers an excellent glimpse into a soul that is divided between his open loyalty to the crown prince and his secret admiration for Eisenheim. Rufus Sewell does a mean, mean job of portraying the prince, you cannot help but hate the bastard, another great job. When the movie was over, I was speechless.
B000007489|4.0|Suicidal Tendencies remains a comma in a footnote in the history of rock, but they wrote one song, \\"Institutionalized,\\" which should forever imprint their legacy.  There are a few songs which capture the zeitgeist of their decade: \\"White Cliffs of Dover\\" in the 40's; \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" in the 50's; \\"The Times They Are a Changin'\\" and \\"My Generation\\" in the 60's; \\"Stayin' Alive\\" in the 70's; and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" in the 90's.  The song for the 80's could be \\"Institutionalized.\\" This punkrock paen to teen angst got sporadic airplay on alternative radio and the band still draws its loyal cult especially in native Southern California, but its canon remains relatively unknown and underappreciated in rock annals. But it will always have \\"Institutionalized.\\" Twenty years later, I still hear it on KROQ, and I suspect its longevity will in itself increase its importance. But it is the lyrics, arrangement and musicianship that preserves its legacy and enduring relevancy.  It is unlike any other rock song in history. Like very few songs (\\"Seven and Seven Is,\\" \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" and \\"Purple Haze,\\" come to mind), it explodes out of the speaker.  The lyrics are at once humorous, urgent and profound.  The brilliantly performed narrative channels J.D. Salinger, Jack Kerouac and Lenny Bruce.  The musicianship is amazing, especially the drumming.     Singer Mike Muir and his band have never capitalized on the potential that was demonstrated on \\"Institutionalized,\\" though many songs in their catalog are vibrant and dynamically performed. But they're still on the road, which is saying something for a band that never compromised its relentless, punk style. If you want to own an important piece of rock history, own any album on which \\"Institutionalized\\" can be found.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|This is an amazing film. Every moment of this film is excellent, from the performances, the score, the cinematography, etc.  This is also one of Ralph Fiennes greatest performances along with fine work by Juliette Binoche, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe.  If you are looking to watch a romantic, thrilling, thought provoking and ultimately  unforgettable film then look no further. If there was a rating higher than 5 stars this would get it.
0618680004|4.0|I have read all of Dawkins books and I admire his clear writing style. On the whole this is one of his better books. The better parts of the book provide some very interesting explanations regarding why people feel the need to believe in a God and in the majesty of the life and the universe and how science has allowed us to understand them. <br /> <br />The book is at its worst when it takes on religious fundamentalists. Although there are an astonishing number of Christian fundamentalists in the world and in the US in particular. People who believe that every word of the Bible is literally true are so clearly deluded that there is very little point in trying to point out all the inconsistencies to them. I dont believe religious fundamentalists would read this book and the kind of people who will read it are not that interested in just how deluded christian fundamentalists are. <br /> <br />I look forward to you next book.
B00004XMTJ|4.0|I was 14 years old when I saw Cats for the first time in NYC. It became my favorite musical and went to see it many more times over the years. This DVD does a great job preserving the musical for longtime fans and future ones.  However, one of the best moments in the show was left out. \\"Growltiger's Last Stand\\" which is a continuation of \\"Gus, The Theatre Cat\\" was completely left out. This was an amazing scene with great choreography, a spectacular set that literally came out of the backdrop of the stage, and an amazing Italian aria duet between the cats Growltiger(Gus) and Griddlebone(Jellylorum). I am sure there was a good reason for it being left out.  However, it would have been nice to have had the complete show preserved for video.  It is still worth having in your collection. Especially, if the show lives in your heart like it does mine.
0064471837|5.0|In an age when most new fantasy works tend to fall in a similar slump, Garth Nix surprised me by this innovative new idea. When I read the back of this book, I was not sure if I would enjoy it.  The whole idea of bells and death just seemed creepy rather than enjoyable. Instead, I found it to be quite the opposite.  I ripped through every page and, though it was predictable at times, the overall story was refreshing and fast-paced.  I would easily recommend this book to anyone wishing to expand their mind when it comes to the fantasy genre.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All~ Metallica is an amazing metal album from one of the best metal rock bands of all time. The guitar riffs are heavy and solos are right on the money without sounding lame. The music is filled with aggression, anger and so much energy that you can almost touch it. The album cover is a well done and the photos are very well done. The font in the book-let is right on the mark and is easy on the eye.  I also like the lyrics which are really well written and one has to say that this much better then the standard metal lyrics that seem to just as happy as to sing about nothing. I highly recommend this album and give it without a doubt 5 ouf of 5 stars.
1569242739|5.0|I've tried multiple recipes fromt his book, the apple cider cupcakes, the rose water cupcakes, your basic chocolate cupcake, fluffly vegan butter cream frosting. All of these recipes worked fantastic! Some cookbooks, it becomes painfully clear that the recipes were never tested. This is far from the case here, the recipes are fool proof if you follow the measurements! The photographs are lush, and the text is full of sass. I had to use the terrible phrase, \\"even your non vegan friends will love this!' but it is true!
B000002HRE|3.0|Reload~ Metallica is an all right metal album that should have been so much better since one demands a lot when it comes to Metallica. The guitar riffs are well executed, the vocals are right on the mark, but the lyrics are nothing close to such as the ones they wrote on the classic And justice for all album. The book-let is not that great and the photos inside are out of focus at times and look like they had no idea what they really wanted with them. This is an ok album and definitely not a shoddy piece of work, however, as written earlier when listening to Metallica one demands a bit more. The lyrics are not nearly on the same level as on their previous albums and they seem to be happy to talk about nothing on this album which is a shame since they can do so much better then this. Even so I give it 3 out of 5 stars.
B000002BQK|5.0|I love this album sooooo much!!! it had so many greta songs in it. I remember when i first got it I never tried to listen to any songs that weren't singles, so i would only listen to Honey, My All & Butterfly (i didn't know about Breakdown or Roof). One day i was bored and decided to listen to every song. All i can say is DAMN. i been missin out. I instantly fell inlove with breakdoown, roof, 4th of july, Whenever You Call, & The Beautiful Ones. Ever since then, every time i buy a cd, i listen to every song because i literally went months of only listening to the singles. Unfortunately i let someone (who loved mariah) borrow my cd and they never gave it back....guess who? my english teacher!!! every day she =had an excuse of why she didn't bring it or it was in her car! Now you now if a teacher would steal a cd from her student, than that cd is worth buying..Believe me, your missing out until you get this!
B00004KD11|2.0|Deep Purple started out in early '68 as Vanilla Fudge clones.   John Lord caught the Fudge in fall '67 when they played London and were one of the hottest bands around.  Ritchie Blackmore was more into Hendrix after making a living as a session player and in bands like Jerry Lee Lewis' back-up band.  When Lord and Blackmore came together in early '68 they agreed they wanted to become a British Vanilla Fudge with Hendrix overtones.  This is what they came up with......\\"Hush\\" and \\"Hey Joe\\" are the best tracks here.   They were still finding their direction, and only became \\"heavier\\" when Zeppelin's first album came out in '69.   For a start, not a bad album......but nothing like what they would become later.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|This recording was released two months after I started college.  It made a huge, huge impact on me and was likely the best thing released during my college years. <br /> <br />The crisp, clear guitar-oriented sound was so unlike anything I had heard before that I was intrigued and listened to it almost daily for months.  All these years later,  it still sounds delightful and never fails to mentally take me to my first apartment where I first heard these sounds, in between studying for physics and learning how to cook something more complex than macaroni and cheese. <br /> <br />Pure, classic, haunting, crisp.   Just buy it.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Watching the slow moving pace of \\"Capote\\" made me marvel at how much modern film making depends on rapid cuts and digitized sweeps to mark passages. I haven't seen this many single camera shots in a film in years...and guess what? They make the movie hold its moral center. Despite the way many less aware viewers seem put off by Phillip Seymour Hoffman's affected speech patterns, anyone old enough to remember Truman Capote's legendary presence knows that THIS IS WHAT THE MAN WAS LIKE. So, as a bio-pic, Hoffman goes way beyond imitation into making understand who Capote was as a man.<br /><br />That is the true focus of the picture. Truman Capote wanted to find the topic that would make him a giant in the literary world, and he found it in the Clutter Family Murders in Kansas. You see him charm a small town of Kansas citizens into giving him the story and, as he gets deeper and deeper into the minds of the killers, lose his soul. Capote was as manipulative as he was charismatic, and the scenes where he interacts with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.)and feels the twin repulsion and desire for this man, \\"Capote\\" find a conscious at war with itself. At one point, Capote describes his attraction to Smith's similarities to himself as men who \\"grew up in the same house....and he want out the back door, and I went out the front door.\\"<br /><br />As the years go on and the court case drags out through appeals (that Capote initiated), he realizes his work in progress - about these men he says he wants to make sure don't get portrayed as monsters (even as he realizes that they ARE monsters) in his novel - is actually becoming a monster that has swallowed his whole.

B000KJU182|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 10 years old and it never left me. I studied the book in University, and was given the VHS copy from England some years ago. What a classic! Lines such as \\" The Law will exist as long as man has a mind, and Justice as long as he has a heart\\" and \\"Goodbye old Rights of Man\\" stay with me to this day. Ustinov did such a brilliant job in capturing the heart of the novelette by Melville. The portrayals of each character were excellent, as was the tension between Budd and Claggart, not just black and white caricatures, but expressions of the complexity and complicity of the human heart. Terrence Stamp is totally believable in a role that would be very hard to portray, Robert Ryan as Claggart is so totally humanly corrupt and bitter that you feel pity for him even as you despise him, Ustinov as Captain Vere is palpably torn in his head versus heart conflict. Keep an eye out for a very young John Meillon (Wally in Crocodile Dundee fame for those outside Oz) and David McAllum pre \\"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" fame. A terrific tale on so many levels and one of real impact to those who believe in LAW versus JUSTICE. God bless Captain Vere!
B00004THAY|3.0|The Album Riding With the King has some really fantastic blues songs but is lacking the elements that would make this album worth buying. The 12 songs are all repetative and dull; they should have put some classic blues songs like \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\". You would think two notorious classic blues guitar artists would collaborate to make a better album. Spend the extra money and buy Eric Claptons live album \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\", its worth the money.This album definatly didnt meet my expectations. But what do you expect from a guy who refuses to play chords.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|After reading all these comments I bought the DVD just out of curiosity: to see the big screen star Chloe Sevigny in the (you know) scene. And I was totally surprised by actually being moved by the film and to find it so tragic. I think the movie is a good piece of art and the whole road part skillfully serves the purpose of preparing us to feel the depth of the main character's loss. By the way the scene everybody was talking about here that initially triggered my curiosity was not erotic at all (too much talking) but I don't think Gallo intended it to be.
B000J10ERO|4.0|\\"Superman Returns\\" is -- overall -- a terrific film. It has one of the most thrilling action sequences I've seen in a long time. It has a clean, spare script and Kevin Spacey's tightly wound, near-psychotic Lex Luthor. The story line not only connects logically with the first two films, but builds on the \\"Superman as Christ-figure\\" theme and brings it to a logical conclusion. Several scenes reference \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", a film with similar thematic elements. * Not to mention the outstanding cinematography and magnificent production design. And it has Bryan Singer's nearly perfect direction, reminding us that he also directed \\"The Usual Suspects\\", which the X films did not.<br /><br />So why haven't I given it five stars? Brandon Routh.<br /><br />George Reeves and Christopher Reeve truly inhabited the role. The brought to it an earnest intensity, acting as if they really believed they were this preposterous super-being. Note particularly the scene in the Donner version of \\"Superman II\\" where Reeve removes his glasses and stares at Lois, and he _is_ Superman, though in Clark Kent's clothes.<br /><br />Routh largely wanders through the film, an actor in a costume. We never believe he's Superman because _he_ never seems to believe it. When Luthor's goons beat him to a pulp, and Luthor pierces him with a kryptonite shiv, our reaction is more one of embarrassment than sympathy or pity. My attention was drawn to Superman's cape, which looks like a cheap vinyl shower curtain.<br /><br />This failing can be laid at Bryan Singer's feet, who cast and directed Routh. An actor playing Superman needs, more than anything else, \\"screen presence\\". Reeves and Reeve had it. Routh does not.<br /><br />Unless Routh dramatically improves, or someone finds a better actor, the future does not look bright for the Superman franchise.<br /><br />* After 28 years, I finally noticed that the three final notes of the opening section of John Williams' main theme (dah dah-da-da-dah, dum, dum, dum) are the Zarathustra \\"World Riddle\\" theme in reverse.ah, dum, dum, dum) are the Zarathustra \\"World Riddle\\" theme in reverse.
B00000GAIW|5.0|If I had only 10 rock CDs in my collection, this would be one of them. <br /> <br />Most people are familiar with \\"Locomotive Breath\\" - a excellent cut on this CD - and if that song strikes your fancy, then you'll love this CD. <br /> <br />Musically,  the songs are masterpieces with lyrics that explore topics rarely discussed in modern music.  This CD sounds as refreshing, current, and contagious as it did when it was released about 30 years back. <br /> <br />The world would be a poorer place had this CD never been created.
0307237699|5.0|Truth be told, 2006 was not the emergence of a revolution by the national Democratic Party. More like having the bully - in the guise of the Republicans - slipping on some wet sand to give the wimp just one more face full of sand, the Dems victory was lucking into a few more hours on the beach due to the arrogance and corruption of the Republican Party, not any new workout schedule to make the wimp bigger & stronger.<br /><br />And the national Democratic leadership has been running basically scared for at least 25 years, lurching around as Republican Light and scared to  present a new, energetic Presidential candidate who has ideas to truly set on a road to the future.<br /><br />Illinois Senator Barack Obama is that new Democrat and his beautifully written The Audacity of Hope possibly is the vehicle where the reader - no matter what the political association - can begin following what may be a Presidential run from one who wants this country to learn from the past to understand the present and step boldly on a new path in leading domestic and foreign policies.<br /><br />But solely reading the book as a prelude to a national campaign may mean the reader will miss nuances in this powerful message. Whether or not Barack Obama makes a run for President, he should be given the opportunity to have a larger voice in the Democratic Party. That is unless the Dem power-brokers think the respite from the flying sand is because of a bottle of expensive pills from a nutrition store that somehow scares the bully into stumbling and falling.
B000006NPY|5.0|After reading other reviews of this album, I had my doubts about it. However, when I finally broke down and bought it, I felt like I had found a true treasure. This is definitely the type of album that grows on you. The first few times you hear it, expect to be a bit under whelmed. But give it a chance, it's worth it. Now Adore is one of my favorite albums. But don't just take my word for it. Check out the different songs on You Tube dot com. I particularly recommend the following performances: <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins Tear   -   8:17  1998/05/28 <br /> This is an incredible performance! I wish I could have been there. <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins Pug - 6:12  Sao Paulo, Brazil <br /> All of the performances at this concert were great but this was   my favorite. <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins Daphne Descends - 5:01 Bilbao `98 <br /> Go James!! <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins Ava Adore - 4:27 music video <br /> My favorite music video of any group <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins Through the Eyes of Ruby - 8:46 mellon collie tour before Jimmy was nixed <br />Well, OK, I realize this song isn't on Adore. But it's my favorite song on Mellon Collie and this performance is just amazing. It starts out strong and just keeps getting better and better!  <br />
B000I5X81A|3.0|First, let me say that I am a HUGE Clapton fan, and then say that I have been disappointed in his releases over the past 10 years.  They totally lack emotion and are over-produced. <br /> <br />This is nice, pleasant CD, perfectly listenable.   <br /> <br />\\"Danger\\"  is nice ditty, and perfectly good toe tapping track with nice tasteful organ.   The fretwork is sub-par. <br /> <br />\\"Heads in Georgia\\"  is a nice JJ Cale tune, laid back and nice vocal harmonies. <br /> <br />\\"Missing Persons\\" is another toe tapping guitar tune, with a great rhythm but again, lacking in fretwork. <br /> <br />\\"When the War is Over\\"  is a New Orleans style rhythmic track with some good slide work by EC. <br /> <br />\\"Sporting Life Blues\\" is one of the best tracks on the CD.  EC has a hard time screwing up the blues, but is not particularly noteworthy but a pleasant track. <br /> <br />\\"Dead End Road\\" is a country song with a fiddle, which I believe is a first for EC. Great beat and very toe tapping. <br /> <br />\\"Its Easy\\"  is another blues song, and while particularly striking is OK. <br /> <br />\\"Hard to Thrill\\" is another blues song with a terrific organ opening, but goes down hill from there. <br /> <br />\\"Anyway the Wind Blows\\" is a shuffle blues track with a compelling rhythm and the only track on the CD with a decent guitar solo. <br /> <br />\\"Three Little Girls\\" is a quiet ballad. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Cry Little Sister\\" is pointless and is one of the weaker tracks on the CD.   <br /> <br />\\"Last Will and Testament\\"  is another blues song, and has some awful harmonies. <br /> <br />\\"Who Am I Telling You\\"  is a slow piece with the message of sorrow and pain.   <br /> <br />All and all this is a nice CD and certainly worth buying.  I can't say it is a great CD or anything close to Eric's half dozen masterpieces, but it is laid back, and toe tapping bluesy country CD.  As Donny Osmond once said, \\"A little bit country and a little bit rock and roll.\\"
0446615625|1.0|Would have given three stars if Baldacci hadn't spouted his anti-american rhetoric. Even if you agree politically with him you probably will find the story is only medicore.  Story about the kidnapping of a president is really implausable.  The Camel Club are group of conspiracy nuts that solve the crime. Honest to god, that is the story.  Now save your money.
0743289412|5.0|At Boo'ya Moon and I loved it. I've been a Stephen King fan since his first book came out and waited with anticipation for the next one. There was a period of time, when it seemed the stories were sketchy and the books padded  with endless descriptions; that's when I lost interest in running out to buy his books as soon as they were published but I've got it back, in spades!! This is the kind of book that I can't put down and yet dread the last page because I don't want it to end. Stephen King has gotten this one just right.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Ive been slogging through the earlier reviews before me, and I think there might be something wrong with me as I preferred this Awake compared with Closer or the debut cd. I have loved this cd from the first note, whereas I had to listen to multiple times before I liked the other ones.  <br /> <br />I am lucky enough to discover the CD/DVD combo in one of the JB hifi stores here in Melbourne and it's nice to see how Josh interacts with everyone around him. He seems so laid back, and I guess that translates to the music he does. The joy of doing what he wants and having enough status to go his own way must be really rewarding. The two bonus tracks of Verita and Awake are also more than worth the extra cost. So even though Ive already purchased the whole album from iTunes i still went ahead and bought the CD and so far no regrets. <br /> <br />My favorites are 'So She Dances\\" & 'In her eyes'. Both are just so emotion filled. Hopefully more people would enjoy this release on its own merit and stop comparing it with his other cd's. Wouldnt it be a dull world if every song Josh'd make is all just like 'You're still you'? I for one wouldnt care for that!
B000I0QK74|5.0|Trimmed the tree with this on and it was perfect!  Mellow JT.  Great song choices.  So pleased that this was one of two of my annual Christmas CD's
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is an outstanding piece of work.  Buy this DVD, save it, and look at it again in 30 years.  Hopefully, we will react better to this crisis in the next 30 years than we did in the last 30 years, but probably not.  The next 30 years is just going to be the same as the last 30 years...no action on our part.     <br />
0451167716|5.0|I read this thirty years ago and loved it. I picked it up again and started to read it, and could not put it down. It's a great story with amazing characters. It's funny, exciting and very poignant. The world of organized crime comes totally alive. I never reread books because there are so many potentially great books I've never read. My son passed on his copy of The Godfather to me, and I'm glad he did. My second time through, it was still one of my favorite reads of the year. An all-time favrite! It is certainly not dated.
0321213351|5.0|This book is an important contribution to the design patterns library, particularly for practicing programmers as opposed to theoreticians.  Most of the design books that we read deal with patterns in a vacuum, constructing toy examples which demonstrate the pattern at hand but have little in common with the kinds of software contexts that we are likely to encounter as serious programmers.  Typically we are not designing systems from scratch; normally there is some combination of new and legacy code that must be made to cooperate in some coherent way, and we may perceive that some pattern would be desirable, but executing the transformation of the existing systems to express that pattern well typically involves significant risk of regression.  That is a central focus of this book: how to break up this transformation into sequences of safe re-factorings.    Another important theme of the book is that the application of patterns typically entails various trade-offs.  A well-known pattern may better communicate the relationships and responsibilities of the various software components we are working with, but on the other hand the pattern may introduce extra complexity if the problem being solved is amenable to some simple and minimal approach.  Using the approaches of this book it is possible to introduce patterns if needed later in the development cycle, and in many cases it may turn out that the patterns are in fact not needed.  In these situations, the lengthy application of patterns upfront would have been a premature optimization.    And this brings me to the last point that I want to make about this book: its content is strongly based on real world experience, and presented in a way which fits what we need as real world engineers.  I thought it was interesting to see a negative review of this book where the complaint was that the author was talking about his own experiences too much.  The relating of the theory presented to actual past problems solved is one of the most valuable aspects of the book, in my opinion.
B00005JPCA|3.0|I have to say it was pretty odd seeing Bond being put under so much pressure and having to fight his way out of it to the extreme.<br /><br />Now the story is not the thing that is going to grab you in this movie but the action will.  The movie is unfortunately kind of a bore when there is no action going on but when it hits it is truly something special.  It starts out with a foot chase where Bond is trying to catch a man who he never should have started chasing.  This guy is doing some of the most dangerous jumps I have ever seen in a movie and he just flies through the air with such ease always knowing he will make a spectacularly easy landing.  If you have seen the French film 'District B-13' then prepare to be even more amazed!  Now the action itself in all of the scenes is absolutely brutal.  Definitely the messiest Bond movie and all the better for it.  This is not one of my favorite Bond movies ever, even from recent years, but Daniel Craig will certainly force you to recognize him.  I vote for Craig as the toughest Bond, by far.
B0002KVULG|5.0|The editorial review is WAY off on this one!  This is by far the best Dracula made to date.  The actors were perfect for their roles and the script and directing makes it a classic.  Frank Langella's portrayal of the character is sensual, alluring, and a perfect example of the bad boy you should stay away from but are inexplicably drawn to!  My sister and I can't watch this enough times!!!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This collection has a great deal of historical significance in my opinion, if for no other reason than the following: It showcases beyond question the intricate and essential role that George Martin played in the creation of the Beatles' music. Beatle fans have known for years that Sir George was responsible for a lot of their trail blazing arrangements and was the the guy who introduced the Fabs to many aspects of music that lay waiting for them outside the rock & roll periphery. But listening to Love, we finally get a chance to see just how influential he was.     My assumption here is that Martin's son, Giles, also given production credit for Love, was primarily on board to back up a man whose ears and hands are more than 80 years old. In other words, the feel of the project seems to be pure George Martin. (If I'm wrong, Giles, forgive me!) And what makes this collection so fascinating - and enjoyable - is that instead of hearing a work - i.e any other original Beatle album - which came from source material that occurred outside our awareness, we're listening to Martin's ideas about songs we already know quite well. Therefore, the Beatles' producer's mind is finally seen in full clarity.    Some of the material here is \\"merely\\" vastly improved remixing and remastering, such as Help. A few of the productions are a little forced at times - e.g., Octopus's Garden. But there's a lot of brilliance here and it's incredible, to me anyway, that a man of Martin's age still retains so much youthful exuberance in his vision.     As has been said elsewhere, Strawberry Fields is a classic, worth the price of the entire collection. My favorite part is when he's got Piggies and Hello Goodbye going neck and neck, the former changing the meaning of the latter's vocal melody because the chords are so different. If you've heard it, you know just what I'm saying. Another standout is Drive My Car, which has an almost Escher-like morphing process going, involving What You're Doing, Taxman, The Word and  Drive My Car. It's an amazing arrangement and it's SO essentially Beatles that we now get how much of that sound came from this man's imagination.    And taking a cue from their last recording, Abbey Road, the CD ends rather undramatically, with a clip of Lennon from the end of one of the Beatles' early Christmas records made for their fan club members during the 60s - \\"This is Johnny Rhythm saying 'Good night to yas all - and God bless yas!'\\" If you're at all into the Beatles, or have ever wanted to be, you'll be really glad you've purchased this CD.    This added after a few listens:     Another interesting touch is the inclusion of complete tracks that were only partly used on the \\"official\\" release of certain songs. For instance, the end of Back in the USSR reveals McCartney vocal ad libs that were left off the White Album. Also, I Am the Walrus features more strings than the original, although truthfully, that may be a function of how cleaned up these mixes are. Either way, the experience is new, which is a pretty big deal for (us) Beatle fans that have heard these songs 1000 times over the years.    And one more thought: The transition from Mr. Kite to I Want You is so inspired it makes you smile in disbelief. Too much...
B00004TS0E|3.0|The 1994 version of Miracle on 34th Street does not bear comparisons or accolades to the original 1947 classic.  The film had already been remade prior to this version, and one asks, why?  And also, why change a bit of the storyline?  John Hughes should be praised for his attempt at producing a holiday film, but it may be an attempt to compete with other films that came out in the early to mid 1990s, the Home Alone movies, Jingle All The Way, and the Santa Clause.<br /><br />The unique trait about this version is its comic book-like quality.  The film is fiction, and is based on Valentine Davies' book of the same name.  Indeed, Kris Kringle (Richard Attenborough) saves the day by substituting as Santa Claus for Cole's Thanksgiving Parade.  However, there is a villainous quality to the film with the appearance of the antagonist character of the film, rival retail store president of Express Superstore, Shellhammer (Simon Jones III), who wants to engage in a Cole's department store takeover.  Unfortunately, this is the unnecessary part of the film.  For a moment, one may think this may be a period film, which takes place about the same time as the original -- the costumes of the characters, and the all too familiar New York City scenes.<br /><br />However, that is not the case.  This is a present day version, which emphasizes quite loudly the meaning of Christmas; look closely at the concluding courtroom scene.  The main premise of the storyline is intact, but with minor changes.  Yes, the store name has changed from Macy's to Cole's, Fred Gaily (John Payne) has changed to Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott), and the courtroom scene where Judge Harper (Robert Prosky) determines if Kris Kringle is exactly Santa Claus has slightly changed as well.  And there are also the concluding scenes, which are questionable.<br /><br />Miracle of 34th Street attempts to engage the viewer.  The cinematography emphasizes much illumination, and the photography literally shows the characters, Susan (Mara Wilson) and Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Perkins), glowing like angels with the sun shining over them in order to depict a dream-like quality to the feminine characters.<br /><br />For many who enjoy the original 1947 version of Miracle on 34th street, it is best to avoid this version unless you happen to see it on TV.  It is deserving of three stars because of its holiday theme.) and Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Perkins), glowing like angels with the sun shining over them in order to depict a dream-like quality to the feminine characters.

0385247125|4.0|I was very amazed when I finished this book because it was very detailed. Michael Jackson explains everything about his life to the day when he found his dad's guitar and became interested in music to him releasing BAD. I personally loved this book because it was probobly going to be the closest I would ever get to the King of PoP. I recamend this book to every one out there who thinks Michael is a freak and who have nothing but bad things to say about him. YOU ARE ALL WRONG! In this book I found himself to be a very down to Earth and Caring guy.
B000GFLEB8|3.0|This movie was shot in a way to intentionally to appear grainy in a lot of frames.  Now the irony is obvious, what is the point to have a HD version of this movie?  I loved the movie.  Since I don't own the SD version, it's just a really pricy movie in my collection.  Catherine Zeta Jones looked stunning in a few frames, but I am not sure if she would look any differene in 480p.  It's a great movie, but you probably can buy it for a 1/4 of the price in regular DVD and you probably won't be able to tell the difference.
B000I5X80G|3.0|After hearing about the Neil Young \\"archives\\" since the late 1970s and waiting patiently ever since, this is what we get for the first release???  Sheesh.  It's only 43 minutes long!  Essentially 1/2 a disc.  Sure the sound is high quality, and the performance is great, but these shows opened with a solo acoustic set.  Where are any of those songs?  Why no renditions of \\"The Loner\\" or \\"Cinnamon Girl,\\" both of which were played in the electric set during this run?  Maybe there are valid reasons for this, such as old tape problems, but there are no liner notes explaining anything about how this was put together.  If -- as I fervently hope -- the next \\"Archive\\" release is from the 75 Rolling Zuma tour, PLEASE make it a 2-disc, full concert set.   <br /> <br />By the way, the music's excellent, there just isn't nearly enough of it.
B000J10ERO|3.0|Terrific attempt at trying to find someone to portray Christopher Reeve as Superman. Botched attempt to bring the legend up to date. Face it. Brandon Routh miscast, thinking that he is an actor. <br />    Superman a deadbeat dad? Lois Lane as single mom of an illegitimate child? Living in sin with a man not her husband. Lex Luthor just walking in to the Fortress of Solitude, Unchallenged and without difficulty. <br />    Lois forgetting who the father might be? Forgetting that she had sex with Superman? Then remembering that Superman is probably the father of her child. Then not remembering that Superman is Clark Kent. <br />    Instead of pretending that Superman III & IV didn't happen, we'd be better off pretending that this one didn't happen. Sorry guys. Back up and try again.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released and I've never had a movie impact me like this one. I was of the Christian faith (not really a church goer) most of my adult life but this movie made me realize it was time to return to my faith!! I DO believe Jesus died for our sins and historical inaccuracies or not(NOBODY was there)- all should see this movie that even recognize the goodness of a man like Jesus. I've never understood the controversy and never felt that the Jewish people were RESPONSIBLE for the death of Jesus --- \\"God sent his only begotten son...........\\" - it HAD to happen for the rest to be fulfilled.  Was it bloody and cruel?? Yes - sorry to tell you this but people are cruel at times and I'm sure crucifixion was not at all a pleasant, write home about it experience. <br />Most death sentences aren't. <br />I see no need to pick the excellent film apart no matter what your belief system is. \\"It is as it was\\" - Christ crucified.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I must confess that when I heard the title to this film I was not expecting much. However, I will say I have never been more pleasantly surprised by a film. Each character in Little Miss Sunshine adds a little more spice to the dysfunctional stew.  <br />The film begins with quick glimpses of each of the characters: the daughter Olive watching a beauty pagent, the son Dwayne discipling himself through exercise in his bedroom, the grandpa (Alan Arkin)cutting lines of heroin in the bathroom, the mother (Toni Collette) denying smoking as she is smoking in her car, the father (Greg Kinnear) finishing a lecture to minimal applause and of course the uncle (Steve Carell) who is looking off into space in some sort of hospital after a botched suicide attempt. <br />Unlike other dysfunctional family films, this film isn't afraid to be humorous yet heartfelt. The film focuses on the families dyfunction and misfortune in an effort to get Olive to California to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine competition. Each character was beautifully crafted and executed to perfection. Paul Dano killed in the role of Dwayne and hopefully we will see plenty more of him in the future.  <br />When I saw the film in theaters, the finale received a standing ovation. I  laughed past the point of tears and told everyone they must see this movie. If you're a smartass, you'll love this film.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I believe this will go down in history as one of Clapton's better albums. I am very stingy with the 5th star, but this CD clearly earned it. <br />The vocals are so low key and under-stated that it takes a few re-plays to appreciate all the great guitar licks that are going on. But there is plenty of great guitar to listen to, plus  a few guest appearances by guitar gods Derek Trucks and Albert Lee etc. <br />My one complaint is the meager liner notes, which  don't list which guest artist is playing on each song. Billy Preston is in there somewhere. <br />The song writing talent of JJ Cale really shines through, and probably explains why this collection of songs works so well.The first 5 cuts are particularly noteworthy.Then,  John Mayer contributes nicely with \\"Hard To Thrill\\" . \\"3 Little Girls\\" and \\"Last Will and Testament\\" also impressed me. For amateur guitarists, this is a great album to play along to and learn a few tricks
B00006399Z|5.0|This is a great release by a band that doesn't get near enough attention. The disc opens in high gear with a Medicated Goo that gets stuck in your head and is almost impossible not to dance to. Seriously, you'll be humming this all day long. Sad And Deep As You is just as addictive but in a mellow way. Chris Wood's flute on here is beautiful. 40,000 Headmen is magical in A very Traffic way. Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave has a great organ and guitar riff. Gimmie Some Lovin' and Dear Mr. Fantasy are the best versions out there. If anything, the only drawback is that the new version doesn't have any bonus songs. Still, what's here is excellent.
B000000JO3|5.0|There is no better example of Hardcore than Minor Threat's \\"Complete Discography\\". None. This record will be here long after we're dead and gone, and it's message will still be as powerful as the day these songs were debuted live. Songs like \\"Straight Edge\\" defined movements, songs like \\"Look Back And Laugh\\" incorporated intelligent thinking into Punk and songs like \\"Minor Threat\\" provided thousands of angry kids with a song to scream along to. You can't stop this record, because as they say, they aren't a Major Threat, They're a Minor Threat, and that's the easiest kind to let slip by.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is one BBC film that should not be missed. It's a splendid adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's book of the same title. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was my first time seeing either of the 2 main actors, but they were marvelous. This was a well-acted, well-written script, and a delicious piece. If you love British period dramas, you MUST see this film.  I think it has one of the best film endings ever...just wait for it!
0743298020|4.0|This book, like most that receive a great deal of hype, appears to have thoroughly polarized its readers.  I, for one, really enjoyed the book.  I thought the language used was beautiful, and it is obvious that Setterfield is a bibliophile herself.  One can tell based on this passage from the book:    \\"There is something about words.  In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner.  Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts.  Inside you they work their magic.\\"    Setterfield's words certainly worked their magic on me.  Perhaps there were small discrepancies with the plot, as other reviewers have said.  Maybe there were a few too many coincidences or open ends.  I didn't care- I was so wrapped up in the words, in the story, in the characters, that I never noticed.  The Thirteenth Tale is a modern gothic novel that delivers, and I enjoyed every page of it.  It centers around two women- one a fiction writer and one a biographer.  The one centers her life around creating stories (lies), and the other focuses on finding the truth in diaries, letters, and literary works.  The two working together make a novel that met my expectations in terms of plot development, and that exceeded my expectations in terms of writing style.    If you read and enjoyed The Shadow of the Wind, by Carlos Ruiz-Zafon (also highly recommended!), then I think you will also really enjoy The Thirteenth Tale.
B000J10ERO|4.0|Do people want a savior? Do we deserve one? Or, should we resign ourselves to the fact that things happen for a reason and we should accept them as our fates? As he hovers in the atmosphere with his arms out, so as to form a cross, Superman says he believes we want a savior because he constantly hears people pleading for one. (In this sense, his Superhearing permits him to be omniscient) The film seems to conflate \\"redeemer\\" with \\"rescuer.\\" Whereas a redeemer would save one's soul from an eternity of damnation, a rescuer would merely remove one from harm's way; these are hardly comparable. Having written that, however, I do appreciate the effort the filmmakers have put forth to bring a deeper, more meaningful aspect to the Superman mythos (even if it IS a distinctly Christian one). Jor-El, Superman's father, says he has sent his only son (Kal-El) to earth in an effort to affect positive change, clearly mirroring the way the Christian Bible indicates God sent his son, Jesus Christ. What to make of Lois Lane, along with her son and her man, rescuing Superman from almost certain death after he is stabbed with Kryptonite and plunges into deep water? It certainly deflates his importance and makes him more vulnerable. It is hardly coincidental that Jesus of Nazarene was also stabbed in the side and left for dead. Having someone or something in which to believe can make a positive difference for an individual because it provides hope when we need it most. Not many people actually believe Superman exists, no matter how good the special effects are. Logic does not permit it. For many people, however, Jesus Christ is very much a real person. Yet, no matter how much logic does not permit it, people still believe in Christ the Redeemer: believe in this person and ye shall have life ever after in the Kingdom of Heaven. Are the makers of \\"Superman Returns\\" trivializing the Christian religion, or overemphasizing the importance of the Superman character? I suppose the box office intake is one barometer for the legitimacy of this comparison. (Would it be fair to compare the two, given the vastly different age demographics? Considering the age of the average moviegoer, Superman would win every time.) Much like the Bible, both \\"Superman Returns\\" and the Superman legend make for nice stories, but what we glean from them is what is important. Are we going to rely on someone else for our happiness and, ultimately, our eternity? Or, will we wisely seek to shape our own fates, without reward in mind? The point is that people do indeed look for a savior because we all need help at one point or another. The irony is that each of us can be a hero, a savior or at least someone to help when needed. All it takes is being able to recognize the signals and the willingness to help. Does the world need Superman? Yes, it needs supermen (and women) to become involved and make a difference in our everyday lives. Holding truth and justice as ideal values is half the battle; we need only work for these daily in order to achieve them. Messianic parables aside, I find Brandon Routh to be a little too young to be believable as either Clark Kent or as Superman. He certainly has the body for it and he looks and sounds very similar to Christopher Reeve, yet he seems more boyish than mannish. Perhaps next time around he'll get more lines of dialogue to flesh out the character. The remainder of the cast is terrific, especially Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther. This is a good film, which unfortunately was not able to fully capitalize on its tremendous potential.take is one barometer for the legitimacy of this comparison.

B00006JJ51|5.0|NWA is the best group in gangsta rap history. Ice Cube(conscious gangsta), Mc Ren(the villian), Dr. Dre(rapper/maestro), Eazy E(the hip hop thugster RIP) and Yella(the DJ) breathed life into the rap game and took the world by storm. Straight outta compton set standards for what a rap album was supposed to sound like and NWA set standards for what a rap group is supposed to sound like. Standout Tracks: STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, F*** THA POLICE, GANGSTA GANGSTA, IF IT AINT RUFF(Ren kills it on a solo tip), PARENTAL DISCRETION IZ ADVISED, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, COMPTON'S IN THE HOUSE, DOPEMAN, 8 BALL, EXPRESS YOURSELF(the original and remix), QUIET ON THE SET, A B***H IS A B***H etc. Filler: None. Bottom Line: Straight Outta Compton is a classic that is needs to be in every rap fan's collection. The dope shock value lyrics, the tight productiion(provide by Dr. Dre and Yella) and the little insight that they give in certain songs are all reasons why this album is worth getting.

0743298020|4.0|Margaret Lea has been chosen by the reknowned novelist Vida Winter to document/write her life story.  Margaret approaches the task with none of the excitement that would be exhibited by most writers...and rightfully so.  For Margaret--the reclusive, only child of a bookstore owner and his eccentric wife--is much more comfortable writing about those long dead; additionally, she has no interest in fiction and had never read any of Vida Winter's work.  But soon she does, and finds her novels surprisingly compelling.  Of utmost concern to Margaret is also Ms. Winter's ability to tell the truth; it was a documented fact that there currently existed several different versions of the author's life story...told by none other than the author herself.  After being given a few facts by Ms. Winter regarding her life that were easily verified, Margaret is convinced that Vida is serious in this latest venture, and agrees to do the writing....and the shadowy past of one of the world's most beloved novelists soon comes to light.  It is a past told in Vida's own words, and filled with love, lust, violence and madness...as such is the legacy of Vida Winter's past. <br />A story best read by the fireplace with a cup of hot chocolate in hand...while the wind is whipping outside.  An absorbing read. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB

055380457X|3.0|David A. Vise and Mark Malseed - If you have ever heard of the term \\"Google Economy\\" and wondered what it meant, then this book is for you. Google is the Internet stock that changed the rules on how Internet stocks are stocked. The fledgling company had so much clout that they were able to write their own rules when they went public so that the average investor was able to participate in this boom (normally, only the underwriters of the stock and those that are Well Connected (TM) are accorded the priviledge of owning the stock upon its debut.) In everything that they do, the Google guys -- Sergey Brin and Larry Page -- ensure that they lived upto their motto (\\"Do No Evil\\"; although this has been sorely tested recently when the corporation dictated that the term Google cannot be used as a verb.) Nevertheless, the book is interesting to read, although some parts of it get a bit dreary. The book traces the lives of the Google founders and provides an insight in how Google makes money, and what its plans are for the future (search is just the beginning). As an added bonus, if you have ever faced the GLAT (Google Labs Aptitude Test) and failed miserably on answering those questions, you can find the sample questions answered at [...]
B000J10ERO|5.0|There is no bigger fan of the Chris Reeve Superman 1 and 2 films than me.  I was very skepticle heading in to SR because of my fierce love of the originals and of Chris's portrayal of Superman.  Brian Singer completely knocks this one out of the park though.  He showed great respect to the orginal Superman's while at the same time laying the ground work for future great Superman movies.  Brandon Routh was fantastic as Superman, he really sells you as the man of steel early on in the film.  The opening action sequence with the 777 plane rescue is dazzling and you are left almost speechless when it is over.  Kate Bosworth was good as Lois Lane not as good as Margot Kidder but she did well with the material she was given.  Kevin Spacey almost stole the movie he was so evil and believable as Lex.  You really feel his utter hatred and contempt for Superman especially towards the end of the film.  The original Superman score is there and it is wonderfully mixed with some new compositions as well.  Overall SR is a wonderful film that feels like an epic journey literally from start to finish.  Definately shell out the extra money for the 2 disc DVD because all the making of featurettes are worth it.  Especially if you are like me and love to see how big budget special effects movies are made.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|As a Rainbow tragic from way back, I have been waiting for this for many years. I was hoping for the \\"On Stage\\" line-up, but hey, close enough. Interesting to see Bob Daisley in one of his first big-time gigs - you can see he's having a great time & plays great too. <br /> <br />Sound is great. Visuals are 70's German TV. The camera angles tend to favor RJD for most of the show, with Blackmore tucked away in the corner. But in many ways RJD steals the show anyway - his voice is hard-rock supreme here & he revels in his own performance. His stagecraft still has some way to go, with his banter descending to hilarious farce at least once. Fortunately he got this sorted in the 80's. <br /> <br />Blackmore is his glorious, overblown, self-indulgent self. Rainbow were not the only ones guilty of extending songs to the detriment of the overall songlist - check out Zeppelin's \\"Song Remains The Same\\" & countless others. You can't have the good from the 70's without the bad.... <br /> <br />Frankly I was pretty disappointed with Blackmore's playing, which is generally very sloppy. It makes your realise how much work must have gone into \\"On Stage\\" to make it what it is. Much is made of the story of Blackmore being jailed for two days beforehand, wearing the same stage clothes as the previous gig, etc. This is all good for dramatic tension, and how true it all is I don't know, but his overall playing, the way he cuts the \\"Do You CLose Your Eyes\\" guitar demolition and the lack of flow at the end of the show suggest something is definitely awry here. It's not all bad though - his quiet classical musings are beautiful. Easy to see now that he was always going to end up in that place eventually. <br /> <br />Cozy Powell is a powerhouse & his 1812 Overture is the stuff a legend was built on. David Stone plays well, but you gotta feel sorry for the keyboard player in a guitar-hero's band. Having said that, the keyboards feature quite prominently in the sound. <br /> <br />The extra promo tracks are interesting in that they have re-recorded (or possibly even live) vocals. Ronnie sings great here too. Gates Of Babylon is totally sublime - one of my favourite Rainbow songs of all time (& well covered by Yngvie Malmsteen). Blackmore doesn't even try to mimic the recorded solo - as is his way.   ;-) <br /> <br />There are some great, long interviews, particularly with Bob Daisley, which give a great insight into that period of Rainbow, and indeed the scene in general. Very entertaining. <br /> <br />5 stars for Rainbow fans - who really should own this. I'd give it 4.5 if I could, but settled on 4 as I reckon Ritchie is not really on-song here. As the only available representation of the classic (IMO) Rainbow lineup, it's a \\"must-have\\" anyway. This dvd is beautifully packaged & is full of great stuff that fans of this style & era will really enjoy. <br /> <br />Steve
0767903862|5.0|My husband and I fought over this book while actually traveling through Australia Nov 2006. We laughed at his funny experiences and loved the history woven into the stories. We went to many of the same places that Bryson visited and had the same impressions.  We just loved this book!  It is especially wonderful to read it while you are there experiencing the magic of this amazing country.  We went all over Eastern Australia and the Outback and then went to NZ.  Sorry to say, NZ was pretty boring after Australia! Now we are reading Neither Here or There (even funnier) and A Short History of Nearly Everything.  E Lamberson

Speaking of 'whole paragraphs being out of sequence' I see this poster posted almost the same smelly review for Pavel's other products. This guy must not like borscht! <br /> <br />Pavel's stuff IS expensive, I would agree it's overpriced. Having gotten that out of the way, there is a lot of good info in virtually all of his material. Has the critic ever tried kettlebell lifting? Has he done 30 swings per side with a 55 or 88 lb kettlebell, or is he just throwing stones from the peanut gallery? Try it, genius, then if you don't like it, to each their own. Yeah, Pavel is living the American Dream.... like a few hundred million other immigrants over the past 200 + years. What is wrong with that?
B000J10ERO|2.0|For me, I couldn't get past the fact that the people who put this film together did a HORRIBLE job in casting Clark Kent/Superman.  It tarnished the entire movie for me.  Not for one SECOND did I believe that Brandon Routh could even come close to pulling off the character.  His look was all wrong, and his acting ability is pathetic.  While we're on poor casting, Lois Lane looked like she was 19 years old, yet Clark looked 30.  Looked like Clark was robbing the cradle!<br /><br />Special effects of the movie were great.  The storyline was boring and choppy at times, but overall, it wasn't TOO bad.<br /><br />I simply couldn't get past the fact that this cast was so poorly put together.
B000002N3N|5.0|I love Enya's music, and own several of her albums (albeit not all). This is my favorite by far. The track, \\"Anywhere Is,\\" is the quintessential seeker song. Every track on this album has moved me. This artist is a gift to the world, and this album has to be among her very best.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink had been on a haitus since the Mizunderstood album.  \\"Try This\\" was a failed experiment, and Pink pretty much disappeared from the charts for a number of years.  Pink went back to what worked for her in the past, a more pop oriented sound, with catchy hooks.  It worked this time around, more so than it has ever done.  During the \\"Try This\\" album, Pink started cursing for the first time and continues the trend with this album.  I like it.  It shows the type of person she really is, which is a no holds barred, strong female type of individual.  She's her own person, and does what she wants to do, regardless of outside influence.
0002171856|5.0|The range and detail of information in this book is simply amazing. This book is so well put together I apreciate it as a work of art just as much as a handy reference book in my library. It covers surviving a broad range of environments and emergency situations for long and short periods of time. Not only does the book offer multiple solutions to problems such as fire, shelter, food and being found, but it explains the concepts behind them so that the reader can understand and improvise as needed.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I believe that Josh Groban will be remembered someday as one of the most gifted and talented singers/songwriters of all time.  I was not disappointed in his newest release, \\"Awake\\".  Josh's passionate, and yet soothing, voice continues to stir my soul like none other.  Although I felt as though some of his own songs weren't quite \\"up to snuff\\", they were NOT horrible by any means, and I think that his skills in songwriting will improve as he grows in his career. <br />I HIGHLY recommend this special edition DVD to anyone who would like to get glimpses of Josh's personality.  His sense of humour can be absolutely hilarious.  And as I'm sure many Grobanites can attest to, the caring heart and friendliness he posseses always shine through to those around him. <br />Grobanites, we all owe Josh a HUGE thank-you for sharing his gifting with us.  He works much harder than we think in order to bring us the music we love so dearly.  Thank-you, Josh; you've done it again!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|It is very difficult to describe how amazing this album is. Though all of the songs are familiar, they have been reworked into an awesome feast of sound. I would recommend the CD & DVD audio version, the DVD sound is \\"toppermost of the poppermost,\\" as John would have said. I've rated this with 5 stars, because Amazon does not allow more.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|There was an episode of \\"The Odd Couple\\" TV series where Felix was supposed to be in a cooking contest, but he came down with an attack of bursitis so he couldn't move his arms.  Oscar agreed to be Felix' arms for the contest, i.e. Felix would give instructions (mix this, blend this, pour that) and Oscar would do the actual cooking.  Felix intended to make a classic beef roast.  When the roast came out of the oven, Oscar, klutz that he was, accidentally rammed an electric carving knife into the thing.  Before he succeeded in pulling it out, he had mutilated Felix' roast.  Thinking fast, Felix instructed Oscar to cut up the roast into dozens of pieces.  Then they whipped up a quick gravy and presented a beef stew instead of a beef roast - and won the contest!  Watching \\"Superman II:  The Richard Donner Cut\\", it's pretty obvious that something similar happened to this movie 25 years ago:  Richard Donner clearly set out to make a masterpiece, only to have the Salkinds mutilate his movie.  Richard Lester was then hired to carve up Donner's film into dozens of little pieces and re-package and re-format it, essentially turning a beef roast into a beef stew.  And to think, when this movie first came out in theaters 25 years ago none of us were any the wiser.    I have both films, the Lester version and the Donner version, on DVD.  I've watched them both back-to-back.  I don't think there's any doubt:  the Donner version of this film is clearly the superior version of this film.  I'll give Lester some credit;  his version of the film is clearly the better edited of the two.  Donner's version of the film has a rough-around-the-edges, cut-and-paste feel to it:  some scenes go on a beat too long, some scenes look more like a rehearsal for the scene than the actual scene itself.  Donner's cut doesn't quite have that final, polished look to it that Lester's cut does.  But I'm willing to cut Donner some slack here - he is, after all revisiting material that he left behind a quarter-century ago.  Donner's film is the better of the two for three main reasons:    1)  Lois Lane gets an I.Q. upgrade - in Donner's version, Lois realizes right off the bat that Clark Kent is really Superman and she is proactive about it:  she's trying all through the movie to get Clark to admit he's really Superman.  It makes Lois seem that much more intelligent and therefore that much more credible.    2)  The Three Kryptonian Criminals are much better realized - in Lester's version their malevolence is only hinted at.  In Donner's version we get a real sense of who they are and the danger they represent.  Check for the look of sadistic glee on Terrence Stamp's face as he rips a machine gun from the hands of a White House guard and starts indiscriminately shooting people.  In Donner's cut, General Zod comes across as a psychopath and a megalomaniac but as a brilliant and accomplished man with a deeply wounded sense of pride.  It's a great performance and it all got lost in the Lester version.    3)  Marlon Brando - Once you see his scenes you'll realize how utterly indispensable he really is to these films.  Indeed, in the light of the 2000 DVD reissue of \\"Superman:  The Movie\\" in which Brando's scenes as Jor-el were restored, it's not too much to say that the Brando/Reeve scenes are really the heart of the movie.  In \\"Superman II\\", Kal-el, after forsaking his superpowers for an earthly love, goes back to the Fortress of Solitude to beg for those powers back.  In Lester's version Kal-el screams out \\"Father!\\" and no one answers.  He's about to leave when he sees the mysterious green glowing crystal that built the Fortress in the first place.  He holds it up.  Music up with a swell.  And ... cut to Metropolis.  Superman soon shows up, cape, boots and all, to fight Zod, Non and Ursa.  How?!  In Lester's version there's just this great, big gaping hole in the plot.  In Donner's version that hole is filled in and mightily with a truly magnificent scene between Brando and Reeve, Jor-el and Kal-el.  I don't want to spoil it for you, but that scene - missing in Lester's version - doesn't just fix a continuity error.  It turns out to be the climax of the whole movie!  What a tragedy that we never got to see this scene in the film's initial theatrical release.  It makes sense of all of Brando's mumblings in the beginning of the first movie.  Indeed when you see Brando's scenes, you'll really get a sense of continuity between the two films, how \\"Superman I\\" and \\"Superman II\\" are really two-halves of the same film.  If only for that reason, the Donner cut, whatever other flaws it might have, deserves to stand as the true, the definitive \\"Superman II\\".    All things considered, this is still only a good movie, not a great one.  It never reaches up to the grandeur and epic scope of \\"Superman I\\".  But that's really the fault of the screenwriters, Robert Newman and Leslie Newman and \\"creative consultant\\" (i.e. script doctor) Tom Mankiewicz.  There are too many irrelevant discursions and digressions in the plot (a sequence on the moon, a sequence in Niagara Falls, etc.) and an utterly illogical and bizarre ending.  And when the three Kryptonian Criminals land on earth, instead of having them trash some anonymous middle-American town (identified in the film as \\"East Houston, Idaho\\") wouldn't it be more poignant if they landed in ... Smallville?  But I guess that's my cut of \\"Superman II\\".
B000I5X80G|5.0|Why, why why why? Thats all I hear. The recording rocks, plain and easy. We know all the songs, but here they are presented in raw live format, and including the legendary Danny Whitten of the original Crazy Horse. Of course it rocks out with nice really lengthy jams--- (which, these days is all I crave.. I know the tunes inside and out, I want to just drift away to some nasty Neil Young shredders.)<br /><br />There are so many Neil Young mysteries besides where the acoustic half of this performance is.. so everybody calm down. It is what it is, and I say five stars....<br /><br />WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS.... when the great live album TIME FADES AWAY from 1973 is gonna get released on CD. I wonder how many of Neil Youngs, younger generation fans, like myself, are completely in the dark towards the magnificent tracks on that album, like Yonder Stands the Sinner..... oh yeah! Reprise, the next order of business is to release that one!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is a review of \\"The World at War\\", 30th anniversary collection (2004 edition). There is an older 2001 DVD version of this series floating around, but be sure to get the 2004 edition.    Going by individual episodes, I would disagree with others' opinions that BBC's \\"The World at War\\" is the best documentary on the second world war. You can find more detailed and insightful documentaries on specific campaigns. A VHS tape documentary on Monte Cassino (also available at Amazon) comes to mind. But I will say that as a complete collection, \\"The World at War\\" is the absolute best.     This collection brings you the atmosphere of the times the events took place. The theme music is haunting as ever. You will feel that these events happened just yesterday. More importantly, you get first hand perspectives with the interviews of the participants who survived the conflict.     The overall perspective is mostly a British one which, on the Allied side, focuses on the efforts of the British, American and Russians but glosses over the contributions of many of the Commonwealth allies, including the Australians, Canadians, Indians and New Zealanders (not to mention the Free French, Poles, Yugoslavs, Kenyans and other nationalities). But it's a pretty accurate perspective nonetheless.    If you are a WWII buff, this series is a \\"must have\\" for your DVD collection.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Although I've always found that some of the most memorable moments in the theatrical version of Superman II belonged to Richard Lester, I have to say that after watching this 'cut', I actually prefer Donner's version.  Sure, the continuity's uneven and there's the use of screen test footage, but what we are given here is a rough draft of what was originally intended based on the final shooting script and if you watch it with that understanding, you'll begin to appreciate what Donner was aiming for:  an emotional resolution of how \\"the son becomes the father\\" with just the right amount of comic relief sprinkled throughout.  Given that Donner wasn't able to complete filming, he himself admits that there are some scenes that needed to be shot while others needed to be redone.    For this cut, I think that it would have made more sense to continue the Niagara Falls scene to show Lois uttering to herself \\"Superman happened to be in Niagare Falls and Clark is not around as usual.\\"  It would have segued better into their next scene together in the hotel room where she \\"shoots\\" Clark to prove that he's really Superman.  Also, the scene where Clark returns to the diner to get his revenge on the bully probably should have come just before he turns back time as Superman.    All in all, this DVD is worth it just to see what could have been.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|Loreena McKennitt returns after nine years with \\"An Ancient Muse\\", replete with all of her world/new age gusto. Similar to Enya, Sarah McLachlan and Dido with a dash of Sarah Brightman, McKennitt can't seem to break new ground with \\"An Ancient Muse\\". While the 54 minute experience is well-crafted, it is also sleep-inducing. After a hard day one could easily find solace, comfort and sweet reverie whilst listening to \\"An Ancient Muse\\".<br /><br />As with all McKennitt albums, there are key tracks such as the exquisite \\"Penelope's Song\\" or \\"Sacred Shabbat\\". I also enjoyed \\"Never-Ending Road (Amhran Duit)\\". While I admire everything about McKennitt from her unrelenting artistic vision, to her nomadic musical journeys and finally to doing everything herself in terms of production and distribution, it doesn't change the fact that since 1991's \\"The Visit\\" each album has just been a variation on the same theme. At times I'd like to reel McKennitt in and disperse her creativity. All of her albums are high quality ethnomusicological experiements, but she has yet to make a truly diverse piece of work.<br /><br />If you like McKennitt's music you will probably like \\"An Ancient Muse\\", but there must be some fans who want more experiementation and diversity, right?
B000AXSN5G|1.0|This album was disappointing, as have all of Neil's LPs since about 1975. This obsession with hitting the 'Harvest' groove again and again is really getting me down. He didn't even LIKE Harvest all those years ago, why has he spent countless albums (Silver and Gold, Harvest Moon, Greendale, this one, probably more!) trying to recapture something he himself said put him in 'the middle of the road?' Don't get me wrong, I am a massive Young fan, got lots of his records, from Springfield through CSN&Y. I rate his soundtrack to 'Dead Man' as his finest work of the last twenty years, if not longer, because it's different and interesting, not just him kicking back the cliches on the porch of his ranch house. Go buy any of the following albums instead: <br /> <br />Buffalo Springfield <br />Buffalo Springfield Again <br />Last Time Around <br />Deja Vu <br />After the Goldrush <br />Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere <br />Zuma <br />On The Beach <br />Tonight's The Night <br />Time Fades Away (vinyl only???) <br />Live At The Fillmore East <br />or any of his bandmates/related albums <br />Crazy Horse <br />Manassas <br />If Only I Could Remember My Name <br />Dead Man OST <br />before you even consider LISTENING to this new one. <br /> <br />I think Neil Young gave Stephen Stills a lot of stick for 'losing it', for forgetting what music is about. I think Neil himself has forgotten, truly I do. And I am a massive fan. I have bootlegs and bootlegs of his seventies stuff. Live at The Borderline 74, or any of the CSNY tour 74 songs are all preferable as well. So disappointed.
0743298020|2.0|I agree with the reviewer that said this book was over-hyped.  I was expecting an intellectual thriller about books and/or authors.  As a book lover myself, I thought 'what could be better than that'?!?!  The book started out as very intriguing, but in the end it just couldn't live up to the hype.  Extremely disappointed.
B000001GK0|4.0|Both concertos are played somehow slowly compared to what is usual. These are performances in which elegance counts more than excitement. If you don't like such well-mannered playing, please remove more stars.   The Grieg concerto suffers that way; it is very much pomp here, even with a considerable stress and agitation at chosen moments. The feeling is very much of sitting in a concerto hall among a lot of well-dressed people. Production values are high and Karajan knows very much about sound, this is however not enough to save me from boredom.  But this is not so much about the Grieg concerto. It is more about the Schumann concerto. Schumann was an uneven composer, who made many works that wouldn't be solid enough if they missed the stamp of Schumann, however is this concerto one of his few masterpieces, one of the most solid piano concertos made in the 19th century. It is a more introvert work, which I can take in many different performances. The slowness here doesn't feel slow to me, but somehow less meaningful than by the Pires/Abbado performance, which is even slower in the outer movements, but more meaningful.  This Zimmerman/Karajan is very elegant, and mysteriously warm. Although it wouldn't be my first choice, I wouldn't like to miss it either, as I return to it now and then.  A rougher and more exciting and concentrated recordning of both concertos is the Ormandy/Entremont/Serkin. This is perhaps the best Grieg and a very good Schumann, too. The sound is not state-of-the-art, anyway good enough to me.  The Michelangeli/Fruebeck de Borgos (Grieg) has too bad sound in my opinion.  Very special is the Vogt/Rattle, both concertos, a very expressive, almost dark Schumann and a brisk and easy Grieg.  The Pires/Abbado (Schumann) is a very consciously played, something pure, clean, rounder and less dark than the others, indispensable. That would be my first choice, if I had one.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I never cared for James Bond flicks. The megalomaniac adversaries who have billions of dollars and hundreds of private soldiers in silver lame` but not the common sense to simply have Bond shot on sight, the flying/floating/submersible Bond car that's tricked out with an assortment of the highest of hi-tech gadgets, etc. always seemed silly and shallow to me. I think one of the reasons Michael Myers' Austin Powers character was such a success was because he did an excellent job satirizing the implausibilities and tacky nonsense of Bond movies.<br /><br />Now, with that being said, let me tell you that CASINO ROYALE is a great movie that I very much enjoyed. I don't know but I've been told that this movie and Daniel Craig's Bond is the closest ever to the character in Ian Fleming's books. It was interesting how this movie offered some explanation on the origins of a few things surrounding the Bond myth, like 007's predilection for Aston Martins and his trademark martini - shaken, not stirred. Most importantly, however, it also delved into Bond's disposable treatment of women. Early on, an alluring Mediterranean woman, who could easily have become the next \\"Oh James!\\" cooing 'Bond Girl,' gets  killed, to be replaced with a more mature and independent female lead character.<br /><br />Craig's Bond is a complex character; stylish yet gritty, brutal but human. Not since Sean Connery has the franchise had such a believable 007. Bond's target too is more realistic this time around. CASINO ROYALE has no Dr. Evils living in underwater fortresses surrounded by legions of mercenaries. Instead, the adversary here is a much more menacing figure in today's world: a man who offers his investment and holding services for terrorist money.<br /><br />The ending assures us that James Bond will be back. If he's played by Daniel Craig so will I.
B0007OPKBS|5.0|This is one of my favorite dance movies.  It is funny, features some really terrific dance scenes, a fun plot, and great costumes!  I don't want to add spoilers...but the story takes place somewhere down under at and around a ballroom dance school.  There are so many unforgettable fantastic scenes!  This movie is one that I enjoy watching again and again, only to discover something else I hadn't noticed before.  The cast are terrific and it is just a total keeper of a film!

B0006GAI6O|1.0|After seeing the original production, produced in Japan, I was amazed at the contrast between the original and this Hollywood version knockoff.  Hollywood failed to deliver anything decent, despite the well made original movie they started with. This original story is tasteful, timeless and offers characters we can identify with.<br /><br />This plastic, Hollywood version of the same film showcases yet another uninspiring, typical Hollywood mysogyny mess filled with little more than the usual unmatched market-centered mediocrity.<br /><br />The Hollywood lead is the usual 'star' stud.  He pretends to be a middle aged, professionally advantaged, well-monied power monger who is bored with his life of excess and ease.  He decides to amuse himself and begins his clandestine diversions behind his wife's back.  He ventures into the ghetto, away from his peers and associates.  Here he enjoys slumming on the sly, in hot persuit of his target: a trashy, morally bankrupt, trampy, immature, barely legal dance teacher.  Their lines and interactions are vitriolicly vile in thier predictable, prepackaged, perverse platitudes.<br /><br />This original Japanese story gives far better.  Here is a man who is struggling to find meaning in a life filled with an emptiness he can't quite grasp. This original story isn't wonderlust, this is a shared sense of loss, futility, and disappointment that we can connect with.<br /><br />Hollywood plot changes aside, the casting choices were wrong.  Lopez gives the role a crass cheapness that crudely removes the ramining hints of class, elegance or distinction from the already disfigured indignity by Hollywood upon the original storyline.<br /><br />Here is a fine example of a beautiful story gone to hell in the hands of Hollywood.<br /><br />Hollywood doesn't make too many 'movies', mostly are little more than glorified infomercials, airbrushed extensions of playboy, and mindless marketing campaigns with idiotic dialog full of auditory advertisements and strict adherance to the \\"sex sells\\" standard.  I'd rather not support human objectification and sexual degradation in any form (no matter how subtle).<br /><br />My advice: Watch the Japanese original version of the film and forget about this remade wreck.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6304798466 Shall We Dance?

B000HT386M|2.0|This movie tries to be reminiscent of the great 80's movies. As the movie opens, a song by the Cars is playing, and Adam Sandler is playing the 80's dad lying on the couch with the kids running in to steal a Twinkie. All part of a ploy to capture the Generation X audience, like myself, who so worships the 80's pop culture. As movie unfolds, we realize that it is not the 1980's, but instead, Y2K+ a few years and Adam Sandler is the generation x dad trying to advance his career. The plot turns dark as he turns to technology, a remote control, to neglect his family and fast forward through his life. The nihilism of GEN X is so apparent in the theme. Nothing matters except quick results and worshipping technology. Then the movie captures the current obesity epidemic in America, as Adam Sandler's character becomes grossly overweight, requiring weight control surgery. The excesses of American pop culture and fast food are the culprits. The movie tries to end on a happy note as Adam Sandler's character looks back on his life and the decision to buy the remote control and has the chance to do it all again; right this time without the click. The movie's a depressing comment about the state of generation x and its values. Adam Sandler acts the part so well. I can say that having personally met him in a bar while in college. Sandler is a GEN X icon and this is a GEN X movie. If this is the best GEN X can do, I weep for the future...
B0009AM5I6|5.0|I'm new to the Opera, just getting into it over the last year.  This is a great DVD and to make it even better you get the Highlights CD which sounds great.  Any newcomer to the Opera will love the performance.  But it would be good to also have the libretto handy for the viewing definitely worth it...and keep me updated!
0375714669|5.0|Continuing around where the first book left off, Persepolis 2 covers the author from her early teens to adulthood. <br /> <br />The tone of the second book shifts from the first book in that the character seems to be muich more deliberate with her choices.  In the first book she was a wide eyed child trying to find her place in the world, in the second, she has become quite aware of how people see her and her circumstances and is at times resentful and rebellious.  In the first book you seem to have so much hope for young Marjorie yet you feel the detachement from reality.  But in the second it is much easier to relate to the character, however as a reader I felt frustrated by the limitations and binds placed on her.  <br /> <br />In most of the second book Marjorie is not actually living in Iran.  She is living independently in Austria, bouncing from home to home, all the while trying to find herself.  She then returns the Iran however at this point it is even harder becasue she has become detatched from the culture.  She has become someone who doesn't really identify with either culture she has lived in, which I think is a very interesting perspective.  <br /> <br />
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I love to claim that I was born in \\"The Year of Superman\\", meaning that being born in 1978, I didn't get to see Superman: The Movie on the big screen.  I grew up watching parts 1-4 on T.V. so I didn't know any of the back story about Donner and his Superman fiasco.  It wasn't until the 2001 DVD releases that I realized all of this.  So this is the angle I'm coming from with this review.<br /><br />It's obvious from the special features of Superman: The Movie DVD that Donner and company had a real love for the material.  I came to enjoy Superman: The Movie more after this and finally understood all the goofy moments in Superman II as well as the weird powers.  So I was looking forward to the Richard Donner Cut.<br /><br />(SPOILERS)<br /><br />It's a little strange to watch it in this form at first.  I actually watched it twice.  It definitely portrays Zod, Ursa, and Non in a more threatening manner (gotta love Zod firing a machine gun with that maniacal smile on his face).  I've read the original script for Superman II by Tom Mankiewicz so I know where they were going with part II once upon a time.<br /><br />That is why I say this is a glimpse of what could have been.  In the original script the villains caused so much destruction (destroyed a lot of Washington and monuments around the world like the Eiffel Tower from what I remember reading) that turning back the Earth was the way they wanted to fix it all (which of course is later moved to the end of Superman: The Movie).  Unfortunately, Donner never got to shoot all those scenes so all we get is the destruction of a small country town, some of Washington, and some of Metropolis.<br /><br />I do like the Marlon Brando scenes.  It really does suit the whole father/son story and it adds an interesting dynamic as we see Superman act selfish for once (which ultimately is why all this happens).<br /><br />Overall, if you go into this film knowing the whole story behind the film, you can forgive some of the content (although I had no problem with the Screen Test footage used, despite Clark's hair-style shifts ).<br /><br />I just wish there would have been a way to do an ending that would fit with Bryan Singer's Superman Returns more neatly.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />I will say this.  The fact that the villains survive at the end of this film, leaves it open for Singer to use, at the very least, Zod, in a future Superman film.  And in that respect, this film would lead into Superman Returns.<br /><br />(END SPOILERS)<br /><br />But all and in all, it was an interesting experience to see it, but I think Richard Donner says it best in the special features, when he says that had they been allowed to continue this saga with Christopher Reeve, it would have been an impressive series of films.<br /><br />Thanks for showing us a glimpse of what could have been, Mr. Donner.th the Screen Test footage used, despite Clark's hair-style shifts ). <br />I just wish there would have been a way to do an ending that would fit with Bryan Singer's Superman Returns more neatly.   <br />BUT... <br />I will say this.

037571457X|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this graphic novel.  It is surprisingly witty and more introspective then I expected.   The book is about the author's chilhood in Iran and covers her pre-teen years.  The book reminds you that although we all have our perceptions, the fundamentalism we see on TV represents the views and actions of only a small portion of the population.  Among the rest are people just like the rest of us who are very educated and just want the freedoms Americans or other parts of the world exercise.  <br /> <br />Persepolis give a look into that secret life and how those people live side by side with their oppressors.  I don't think the author intends the book to be a resource in culture as much as a place to spark interest.  The book is actually more of a coming of age story.  Where the main character at a young age finds herself questioning her own values and beliefs, torn between ideals that are pressed upon her by her culture and ideals that she is luckily encouraged by her parents to develop on her own.  The book is very well done and I would definently recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br />Also it's a very quick read so if you happen to not like it, you won't have spent too much time.  <br /> <br />
B00000GAIW|5.0|Ian Anderson doesn't see Aqualung as his best work. Of course all creative artists should always look forward and believe that they are continually growing  and improving their craft. But the fact is undeniable that every songwriter has one creative peak and this album is the peak of Jethro Tull. There was a lot of good music on This Was, Stand Up, Benefit and Living in the Past. But in Aqualung as well as in most of Thick As A Brick and the much maligned Passion Play, Ian was on a music making roll. Sad to say that, with the exception of parts of Songs from the Wood and Crest of a Knave, Ian has never been able recapture that spark. Sure his writing has changed to accomodate the fans, his interests and his diminished vocal resources. And while structurally speaking Budapest from 1987 may be as good as Ian likes to think it is. Creatively speaking, songwriting is a young man's game. What songwriter didn't do his best work during his first decade of recording?
0440243246|4.0|As you can see from my other reviews I have read several of Belva Plain's novels. \\"Evergreen\\", the first of this series had me glued to my reading chair. Sadly, this piece, \\"Tapestry\\", was the next one I read not realizing that there was a second book in the series \\"The Golden Cup\\", I already have it and I will read it soon. But back to \\"Tapestry\\". Taking place during WWII, Belva wrote eloquently about how the war affected the Werner family, living here in the states, as well as those unfortunate casualties of Hitler's regime living in Europe. I loved this book. Belva Plain can write the family saga like no one else. I understand there is a fourth book to the series and I most certainly will read that as well. I think that these are books that women will find most interesting, but as a man, I gotta tell you guys...they are great stories! I am anxious to find out what happens with the relationship between Paul and his daughter and to find out how his relationships with Isle and Anna turns out. A great book to read in front of the fire on a cold winters night. Highly recommended.
188736823X|1.0|For me to enjoy a book I have to be able to relate, on some level, to the characters and it was difficult for me to do that. It's not gender; I've read many books with male protagonists and still found them very enjoyable, but I just couldn't empathize with either of the boys' plights or thoughts or emotions.  Both boys were just so unoriginal and trite.<br /><br />More unforgivable than the fact that the two young boys were rather boring and cookie-cutter, is the fact that this book did not cause me to jump, feel shivers up my spine or feel my heart beat speed up in dread at all. I felt cheated of a scare. I was promised that this was a classic horror story and that I would never forget it, but unfortunately, the reason I will never forget it is because it was such a boring read.<br /><br />I don't understand it - carnivals can be one of the creepiest settings for a story, yet Bradbury allows this choice backdrop to go to waste! He focuses on the carousel, which is great because that can be a pretty scary ride, what with all the bizarre colors and expressions on the animals' faces, but the reason the carousel was scary in this book just did not do it for me. When I read it, my initial reaction was \\"That's it? THAT'S the 'big' baddie?\\" I don't need my horrors to actually be physically manifested in some demonic thing or thrown into my face with no subtlety, but I do need it to actually BE scary and that was just not the case here.<br /><br />There were numerous times when I had to go back and re-read passages that were convoluted just for the sake of being convoluted, that I nearly tossed the book aside in impatience.  Some authors write \\"complicated\\" novels well - consider Faulkner's Light In August for example - but Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes does not fall under that category.<br /><br />Doggedly I persisted and I finished this stupid thing and I wasted my time.<br /><br />Despite how much people seem to laud it (and that's fine - everyone's entitled to his/her opinion) I did not enjoy this book at all, would NOT recommend it if you are looking for a good read and would advise that you turn to Bradbury's short-story collections instead. I think that Bradbury is MUCH better at writing short stories than he is at writing novels like this one.veryone's entitled to his/her opinion) I did not enjoy this book at all, would NOT recommend it if you are looking for a good read and would advise that you turn to Bradbury's short-story collections instead.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is one of those bands that seem to spark endless \\"is this progressive rock?\\" discussions on many internet prog rock forums.  Is it prog?  Is it commercialized pop?  Is it just drivel?  To me none of that matters, this is a damn good album no matter how you categorize it.  I know some of these songs have been played to death on radio, but since I rarely listen to radio these days I never had the chance to get burned out on them.  Both the music and songwriting are strong throughout this disc and I personally do not think there is a weak song on it.  \\"Politik\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Green Eyes\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"Clocks\\", the title track \\"Rush Of Blood To The Head\\", these are all great songs.  This band sometimes gets compared to Radiohead and while I hear some similarities I think Coldplay is more melodic and in some ways better songwriters.  Over the course of their 3 albums the band has become media darlings with their faces having become teenage pin ups.  Don't let this throw you off.  Although this band has become very successful, and continually resides in top 40 radio, the music is still very good and in no way has this band \\"sold out\\" in my opinion.
0380820846|4.0|The first couple of paragraphs of this book are fantastic - light-hearted, amusing, witty - and I settled down for a gripping and brilliant read. Sadly I didn't get entirely that. This was a good book, like Ms Quinn's others, but it wasn't quite as good as some and because of that I was disappointed.<br /><br />This is the fourth book in the series (following \\"The Duke And I\\", \\"The Viscount Who Loved Me\\" and \\"An Offer From A Gentleman\\") and is the story of Colin Bridgerton, third son, and Penelope Featherington. Penelope gets mentioned in most of the other books and in fact there is one scene in \\"An Offer From A Gentleman\\" which features Penelope and Colin and is repeated in this book.<br /><br />In some ways I really liked the premise of this story - it's the good old friends who know each other for years and years and then somehow find themselves falling in love and getting married. It's so nice for the slightly dumpy and apparently dull woman to get the dishy man - most Regencies have beautiful debutants striding onto the scene and ensnaring wonderful men instantly. Penelope waits 12 years for her man - but she gets him!<br /><br />Penelope is a great character in this book. She's not particularly beautiful but she has brains and wit and somehow in this book she discovers a bit more self-confidence or gumption to change her life a little. Colin also is trying to step out of the shadows of his two older brothers and find a purpose in life - these interactions were well drawn and believable. In fact it's in character drawing that Julia Quinn excels and I very much appreciate the way in which her large cast of characters all have their own behaviours.<br /><br />A lot of this book is focused on Lady Whistledown - a plot device used well in most of the other books but probably rather outstaying its welcome. Fortunately Lady Whistledown is unmasked in this book - probably rather more of this was made than strictly necessary.<br /><br />This book also sets the scene for the next (\\"To Sir Philip With Love\\") which features Eloise who was Penelope's best buddy. I like the way the books are interlinked and that we can follow on with the relationships of those who've been married off in earlier books.<br /><br />Overall this is still a good book, much better than most Regencies on the market at the moment, but it's a little disappointing when compared with some of Julia Quinn's others in this series.he scene for the next (\\"To Sir Philip With Love\\") which features Eloise who was Penelope's best buddy.

B000J103N4|5.0|I really enjoyed the 5.1 mix of this rerelease.  But I have to use the dvd-video layer on the dvd as the dvd-audio layer doesn't produce any audio output.

B00000729S|3.0|Black Monk Time by The Monks is a reissue of the only album from this band that was released in Germany on the Polydor label in 1966. Like virtually of lovers of garage/punk music, I had been aware of The Monks and the mythos surrounding them for a number of years. A group of GIs formed a band that played in German clubs and, after discharge from the military; they remained in Europe and attempted to make a go of it professionally. As with any good legend, the details of what happened are murky. Did the group self-destruct amidst drug use and internal conflicts? Did anti-American feeling block their path to success? Did the US government interfere? Were they another great band that didn't get a break? Were they just not good?<br /><br />Regardless of the reason(s) for their dissolution, The Monks were little known in Europe and less known in the United States. However, through successful garage/punk renaissance periods between 1975 and the present, the cachet of this outfit grew. Comments were made that The Monks were the creators and emancipators of garage rock; that they were the trend setters for the later punk revolution with their short, blunt, politicized lyrics and near-free form approach to composition. And so, with great anticipation, I obtained a copy of this album in CD format with the obligatory inclusion of extra tracks in the form of their singles.<br /><br />The first time I listened I was decidedly not impressed; so much so that I wrote a scathing review - now deleted - in which I complained about a plethora of styles ranging from hard-core-like shouted lyrics through Lettermen harmonies to yodeling. I think my view was distorted by the hype and anticipation that this was, in point of fact, some sort of garage/punk Rosetta Stone. That view was self-inflicted and, with that being the case, my review was equally skewed.<br /><br />The Monks must have been quite a band performing live because you can feel the potential as you listen. That the potential is not realized is not so much the fault of the band as the fault of production. There have been many, many fine bands that - for a variety of reasons - have had less than satisfactory recording experiences.<br /><br />While not a Rosetta Stone of garage/punk, I do think The Monks are part of the connective tissue leading to that genre. Some of the tracks have a spoken word feel to them that looks back to beat poetry and free-form jazz while simultaneously looking forward to bands like The Fugs, The Stooges, Velvet Underground, Can and The Sex Pistols.<br /><br />And, like that band, one has to wonder what The Monks might have achieved had they continued.ot so much the fault of the band as the fault of production.

B000053VAZ|2.0|Benny (Aidan Quinn) is the brother of an autistic girl named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson).  He's a bit restrictive and protective of her. Sam (Johnny Depp), the \\"quirky\\" guy, moves in.  Hilarity ensues.  So, what's the problem?   The moviemakers were not content with making a funny, lighthearted movie.  Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc.  These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood.  Sam is portrayed as the truly wise character of the movie, while crazy old Benny is still stuck on backwards ideas like earning money to provide for yourself and caring for the mentally handicapped. <br />There were a few funny parts, courtesy of Johnny Depp, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.
B00004SCX6|1.0|honestly, all her songs are sexual in some way. the way she poses, moves, dresses is wrong and sends the wrong message across. she is unmodest, makes herself into some sex toy on stage and videos, cant sing to save her life. Rebecca St. James is definetly a good alternative that has enough self-confidence in her looks and voice that she doesnt have to wear a [...] outfit on all her albums or cover-up her voice with a computer. get her Transform album. Great pop/rock/teckno-style music with a good message, better voice, and in my oponion, better looking artist.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|Having seen Zero 7 tour in 2001, I kept the name Sia Furler in my memory and bought this soon after it was released. Although different from the work she's done with them, this is a delightful, soulful album that has grown on me. Tracks, including the opener, that didn't seem to hit the mark blend into the overall feel.  <br /> <br />The album develops an involving arc, that spans from the emotionally withdrawn 'Rewrite' to the near cathartic 'Where I belong', sharing many moments of discovery in what she's described as a very personal album. The intimacy that it develops is well maintained but does not stop the songs from varying. The charming, funny 'Sweet potato' and the almost anthemic 'Church of What's Happening Now' move the pace of the album away from predictability. It took a little while before I thought of it as a '5' but did warm to it immediately.  <br /> <br />Her success with Zero 7 and inclusion on the Six Feet Under 2 compilation suggests that her star will continue to rise, and I hope with the beauty and intimacy of this album. <br />
B000H305U0|4.0|Justin Timberlake is a star. However you feel about him, you know it's true. He has the whole package, and he's definitely working it. Future Sex/Love Sounds is well worth a spin. Like Justified, Future is a nice mix of pop/r&b/soul with blazing sex appeal. He indeed brings \\"Sexy Back\\", and while the radio has run it into the ground, it's an innovative pop song and is one of the year's best. Radio ruins everything though! The second single \\"My Love\\" is even better, and it's also the best song on the record in my opinion. It's so smooth and sexy and the beats are killer and fresher than anything out there right now. \\"Lovestoned\\" is another terrific track and is just as catchy. \\"What Goes Around\\" has been compared to \\"Cry Me a River\\" (such a classic!), but it stands on it's own as just a really good song. My only real complaint is that he could have went further with some of the stuff and made it a tad bit edgier, but it's only a small complaint. I don't think it's a major leap from Justified, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. A solo sophomore album is a scary and risky thing, but Justin pulled it off like a champ. He has a lot of ambition, he works hard and he is good at what he does. I just think he can always take it a step further and be more quirky and experimental than he is. I also have to say I love the booklet! At the risk of sounding like a school girl, he is gorgeous and I love the pics of him breaking the disco ball! Also the best cover of 2006 in my opinion. But focus on the music, then appreciate his beauty. He is a very talented guy with only brighter things ahead. Go Justin!
0739321005|4.0|In Kenya, Barack recorded a conversation with his sister's former history teacher. They were talking about foreign influence in Africa. She mentioned how her daughter casually spoke a mix of Swahili, English, and German with her friends. Commenting on this she said, \\"in the end, I'm less interested in a daughter who's authentically African than one who is authentically herself.\\" I eagerly anticipated that Barack would reflect on that statement...but he never did.    The book is an enjoyable read and Barack is a great writer; however, he becomes entranced in trying to be identified as African-American and seems to shy away from, and almost become critical of his Caucasian identity. In a book from a well-educated, bi-racial politician about \\"race and inheritance\\" I wrongly anticipated that Barack would help meld the racial divisions.
6304539282|5.0|Who says the special edition isn't as good as the original?  It's better!  I saw the films when they first came out--I saw Empire once a week until the employees at the movie theater knew me on sight--and I think the additions in the special editions only improved what was already a great series of films, as well as bringing out more aspects of the Star Wars universe.  And Jedi had a fine and compelling plot, the Ewoks were comidy relief.  Some critics should take a refreasher course in theator, drama, and the newances of plot.  Perhaps I'm not a tipical Star Wars fan--I liked Jar Jar Binks too--but I see no reason why the special edition should be considered any less than the original.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I like sci fi, but hadn't really been that interested in this series. On the basis of reviews from other people, I ordered the box set on an impulse. A great decision! Firefly combines interesting stories in a space frontier setting. I love it! Hey - even my wife liked it - a solid indication of Firefly's broad appeal.
B0002S947K|5.0|I resisted the urge to buy this cd when it first came out because of the overplayed song Trouble.  I liked the song, but it was on the radio every time I tuned in and I eventually got sick of it.  And so I waited.    I bought the cd a couple of weekends ago in a used cd store here in West Seattle, plopped it in my player and have been listening to it since.  Not only do I have a newfound appreciation for the song Trouble, the rest of the cd is quite amazing!  It is simply an amazing piece of art...the entire cd is beautiful.    I saw Ray Lamontagne on Austin City Limits this weekend and was blown away by his understated and quiet delivery of song.  He played a couple of tunes from Trouble and his new cd, Till the Sun Turns Black - which I'm getting today.    Highly, highly recommended!    Peace out.
B000002GJH|5.0|This is one of my favorite cd's. I am very bummed that this is the only cd they released. \\"Wooden Jesus\\" is fantastic, and of course \\"Hunger Strike\\" is great! I have a really hard time mentioning just a few songs because all of them are spectacular!!! This cd is a must have for every collection!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|A few years ago I caught a late-night \\"documentary\\" about vampires and werewolves. I use inverted commas because, as it turned out, it was not so much a documentary as a wanna-be Blair Witch-style promo for Underworld. It was slick, cheesy, manipulative and deceptive, and it gave me a low opinion of Underworld, which I decided I would never bother to see.<br /><br />Flash-forward a few years: I see a cheap double set of Underworld and Underworld Evolution, and, being in the mood for something spectacular and stupid, I buy it. I get more than I bargain for. While Underworld doesn't pretend to be anything more than a \\"ride\\", it's the best movie of this type that I've seen in a while. It doesn't treat the audience like kids, it has a unique vision well executed, and it has some fine performances (Michael Sheen in particular is a nice find).<br /><br />Although it is not a straight rip-off, it is not unfair to describe Underworld as \\"Matrix with werewolves and vampires\\". They do have similar looks (bluish tinge instead of green), lots of long black leather coats, and gunfights with rubble flying everywhere. But the setting and story are quite different, and there is less CGI. (Unfortunately, like the Matrix, the sequel is ruined by a bad script.)<br /><br />The story is an interesting update on the horror archetypes, with emphasis more on action than horror. (The special bullets are a surprisingly neat idea.) There are a couple of weak performances on the vampire side, but Beckinsale, Nighy and Sheen are good, and Speedman is okay in a part which doesn't have much depth written into it. There are a couple of misjudgements in the direction of the performances, but these are small things that most people won't notice, and it's still damned impressive for a first-time director.<br /><br />One thing, and it's not really a complaint, more a question of accuracy in advertising: The vampires aren't particularly \\"vampiry\\" - you know, that whole \\"living on human blood\\" thing. It would hardly affect the movie if they were called Atlanteans, say, or Illuminati, instead of vampires. This isn't really a negative, but it may annoy people who expect to see traditional vampires in this film.<br /><br />EDIT: Since this review, the third film, Rise of the Lycans, has come out. The critics hated it, but I loved it. First-time director Patrick Tatopoulos did a terrific job (he did FX on the first two movies). The result was very dark, intense and claustrophobic, but enjoyable because of the production value and the acting. In particular, it was great to see Nighy and Sheen back and chewing the scenery. Nighy was awesomely over-the-top (\\"You have betrayed me... to be with an a-ni-mal!\\"), and as for Sheen, wow, is that really the same guy who played Tony Blair? So I'd rank Lycans at least equal with the first film, and much better than the second and fourth ones.would hardly affect the movie if they were called Atlanteans, say, or Illuminati, instead of vampires.

0743289412|4.0|After reading some other reviews, I didn't find it as violent as I was expecting. I also didn't find it as \\"moving\\" as some of the celebrity reviewers (Nora Roberts, etc.) have found it, but I still really enjoyed it.   <br />The King jargon got really really annoying by the end. If I never see the word Bool again it will be a happy day. I did find the whole \\"alternate reality\\" thing to be very intriguing and Lisey is one of the stronger characters in King's body of work.  <br />Not his best, but not near his worst.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|Not too many artists around Incubus time are still alive and making interesting music. The whole wave of music from the late nineties is pretty much dead and/or extinct, save for a few small tours in towns with odd demographics and few transistor radios. There's a certain reverie for that type of accomplishment and Incubus deserves some merit.<br /><br />After what would seem like their peak with A Crow Left of the Murder, Brandon Boyd and his team of wavy styled musicians managed to carve up some decent tunes. Decent is such a bland word, but to be honest, it might work well here.<br /><br />For starters, songs \\"Anna Molly\\" and \\"Dig\\" (which happen to be the album's first singles) are the only tunes to really chalk up some life that seems to be reincarnated over and over again for most of the album's fillings. To say, \\"I'm waiting for these songs to grow on me\\" would be an understatement and to be quite honest, a thing of the past.<br /><br />\\"Light Grenades\\", the album's title track, sounds like something off of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. without the catchy riff raff that iced over past songs, \\"Vitamin\\" and \\"New Skin.\\" Meanwhile, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the annoying and bombastic, \\"Earth to Bella\\", which unfortunately is in two parts. Boyd's vocals, from start to finish, in this number come off as annoying and repetitive.<br /><br />However, \\"Pendulous Threads\\" is like swimming in the water to guitarist Mike Einziger's staple sound. Aquatic scales and affluent basslines really make out a killer tune that no doubtly sounds exceptional on any subwoofer. This is a track that is inherently a better live performance in the making and probably Incubus first driving fist in a long while.<br /><br />Influence or not, this album has some heavy Police undertones which should make any album worthwhile. Unfortunately, several of the songs are plagued with lyrics that are either forced or juvenile, especially in contrast to Boyd's previous works. One good example of this is in \\"Paper Shoes\\" which starts off fresh, albeit sounding musically like a Pearl Jam tune, but eventually drags on and on with the lyrics going nowhere.(This is the same guy who wrote \\"Sick Sad Little World\\" and \\"A Certain Shade of Green\\"?) It's disappointing considering Boyd is one of the best frontman and vocalists today.<br /><br />With all the negativity, then why the three stars?<br /><br />Songs like \\"Dig\\", \\"Anna Molly\\", the ultimately catchy \\"Love Hurts\\", the rocking \\"Pendulous Threads\\", and the very A Crow Left of the Murder-esque \\"Rogues\\" make the album worth the wait and memorable at the very least. Nevertheless, songs \\"Earth to Bella 1 and 2\\", \\"Light Grenades\\", and \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" are still ultimately disappointing.<br /><br />Is Light Grenades the follow up everyone has been waiting for since 2004? Perhaps. There is some growth in the songs, but not by much... which is usually a good thing. But, for some tracks, a few might be indistinguishable to their previous efforts which may lend light to why those few are actually catchy.<br /><br />In the end, I'd still much rather listen to A Crow Left of the Murder, but who knows? Morning View eventually grew on me, maybe this will. Call me a hipocrite, but I'll be at their first show.resh, albeit sounding musically like a Pearl Jam tune, but eventually drags on and on with the lyrics going nowhere.(This is the same guy who wrote \\"Sick Sad Little World\\" and \\"A Certain Shade of Green\\"?)

B000J10ERO|4.0|When this movie was released theatrically, I was extremely excited.  I've seen all of the previous Superman movies and grew up watching Christopher Reeve as Superman during the late 70's and 80's.  I remember catching Superman & Superman II when they were released to cable and home video.  I also remember going to see Superman III & IV at the movies and later on cable.  So, I have knowledge on the movies. <br /> <br />Superman Returns pays homage, not only to the Richard Donner's Superman and Superman II (cruelly credited to Rick Lester), but, also to Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder.  I found it quite easy to believe Brandon Routh as Superman because he looks so much like Christopher Reeve and his acting was actually pretty good.  I also accepted the fact that it was not Reeve I was watching, but, another actor picking up where Reeve left off (hint, hint).  It was also easy to figure out where Superman Returns actually take place.  I must admit that I first thought that it took place after Superman IV.  But, I remembered that in Superman IV, Clark Kent's mother had passed away.  So, I had to go back and realize that it took place right between II and III.  Having accepted that knowledge, I began to appreciate the film a lot more than I already did.   <br /> <br />The visuals are stunning.  The plot is fantastic.  The casting is great.  The only problem I have with the film is Superman's costume.  I wish the costume was brighter.  However, that's bearable because there's more to movies than special effects and costumes.  The acting, the visuals, the plot, etc. are fantastic and I can't wait to see what Bryan Singer and Brandon have to offer in the next Superman movies. <br /> <br />Buy this film.  It is, indeed a classic and a respectable homage to Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve.  It's also a great homage to Marlon Brandon as he makes a posthumous appearance as Jor-El in this wonderful film. <br /> <br />And to the people who complain about the film retreading old territory:  remember that the last Superman MOVIE was made almost twenty years ago.  I'm sure the director and writers made a conscious effort to make us (those who saw the other movies) remember what happened as well as educate all the new-comers on Superman's \\"movie history\\".  GET OVER IT or watch something else.
6305657947|3.0|This is a movie that moves in fits and starts.  Parts of it are a lot of fun, parts of it stumble. <br /> <br />Most of the stumbling is done when Rene Russo is the focus of the movie.  Admittedly, the script verges on the downright ridiculous, and she's placed in scenes that were simply hopeless.  (Some of the dialogue is so bad that this movie might almost have made its way into an MST3K episode.)  Still, a better actress might have made them...less hopeless.  I found myself groaning and rolling my eyes at her hamming.  And to hot things up, she's reduced to shimmying sans underwear in a see-through gown, and then providing plenty of topless footage.  It doesn't work.  The sudden, extended nudity seems kind of jarring, as if I just switched over to Cinemax without realizing it.  There are also scenes where Russo switches to the cartoonish character known as The Bitch, and she's not believable then, either. <br /> <br />Brosnan is also a touch ridiculous from time to time, but mostly he plays his usual suave, handsome character.  If you like that, you'll like him here. <br /> <br />Dennis Leary surprises with a low-key performance.  If I would have expected anyone to deliver a true hambone performance, it would have been him. <br /> <br />There are lots of shots of exotic locales, like a hilltop cabana on a tropical island, or a glider flying over a forest alive with autumn colors, that are nice eye candy.  We had just gotten our first widescreen TV and it was pretty nice to watch this movie show off the TV. <br /> <br />I found myself reaching for the remote a few times during this movie, telling myself, \\"OK, I've seen about enough of this.\\"  But I must admit, it held my attention, just barely, to the end.
B00005KB9T|5.0|I've heard some great albums, but few are better than Catch a Fire. This is Bob's masterpiece, and his best disc. It's better than even Exodus or Burnin'. There's not a single loser track on this album, and the first four songs (Concrete Jungle; Slave Driver; Stop That Train; 400 Years) are all pure gold. This ties Burnin' as Bob's most political album, but ironically the best on the album is a love song: Stir It Up, a true reggae classic. Really, I can't imagine any music collection, period, without Catch a Fire. Even the weakest song (Baby We've Got a Date) is far from bad. Most Marley albums, while generally good, have one or two filler songs. Catch a Fire has ZERO. Rush out and buy it. It's that simple.

B000002GXX|1.0|It's been a while since I bashed the Eagles, so I thought I'd get back in action. Anyway...<br /><br />Three of the most annoying Top 5  ihts of the '70's can be found on this disc: the title track, a crappy uptempo/pseudo-dance song that's even more annoying than Hotel California; the brainless Lyin' Eyes; and especially the sophoric, overly-orchestrated Take it To the Limit. I don't know how ANYBODY can put up with this group, but if I hear one more Eagles hit on the radio...
6304078102|5.0|This movie is excellent, both as a look at contemporary history and as a character study.<br /><br />Richard Dreyfus earned his Oscar nomination for this role as a music teacher.  The supporting cast is great.  This is a drama, but it has its lighter moments as well.<br /><br />People compare this to \\"Music From The Heart.\\"  I find this more satisfying.  I relate more to Mr. Holland than Meryl Streep's character.  I also prefer the bittersweet ending of this movie to the upbeat, underdog-saves-the-day ending of \\"Music From The Heart.\\"<br /><br />Without giving away the ending of a movie, I remember a conversation with a musician friend who hated the ending, and said most musicians do.  I am one musician who didn't.  I found this to be one of the most moving, tears-of-joy inducing conclusions, only surpassed by \\"Chariots Of Fire.\\"
B00008973Q|3.0|Akira Kurosawa's Ran, is an adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear, set in sixteenth century Japan.  Ran is the story of Great Lord Hidetora who has decided to step down and allow his three sons to rule, Taro, Jiro and Saburo, on the condition that he could live with them in turns as a guest.  The youngest son, Saburo tries to tell his father of the folly in this plan, doubting that all three sons would unite peacefully.  Hidetora is angered by Saburo's attempts to warn him and exiles him from the kingdom.  The oldest son, Taro, his wife Sué, whose family had been killed by Hidetora, and Jiro, scheme to take complete control away from Hidetora and drive him from the kingdom, and then they turn on each other for power.  Hidetora is driven mad by all of this, tended only by a faithful friend and the court jester.  Eventually Hidetora is brought to Saburo, who despite exile, helps his father.  The movie is slow and drawn out at times, but it is an epic tale of greed and the desire for power.  The fate of Hidetora is determined by those who he wronged in the past.
0440237688|5.0|The book \\"the giver\\" is a wonderful book, it is enchanting, and makes you think about the good things about what this life gives us. In this book there is a boy named Jonas who has to go through a transmitting of memmories because the commitee of elders would need help sometimes and would need advice, Jonas now gets to be able to understand birthday parties, and other wonderful things while others are not as wonderful.  he also has to see things that are horrible, while all of the other people in his community are going through sameness, and don't have choices, and colors and rudeness or even holidays, I would recommend this book absolutely.
0618680004|4.0|Briefly, the problem will a scientific theory is that you aren't allowed to ignore the data to buttress your pet ideas. Like a simple quack, Dawkins ignores that atheistic systems are at least just as and probably numerically more violent than religious systems. <br /> <br />The replicating robot known as Richard, a pleasant chap by all accounts, evades the protracted and technologically driven holocaust that was the 20th century. Where is the assessment of the non-religious violence of Stalin, Hitler, Lenin, Mao, Tojo, and Pol Pot to name just six. <br />Just the first two names Stalin and Hitler probably count for 40-50 million deaths... so getting typing !! That's a lot of death crying out for an explanation.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, were the WW2 bombers of Dresden, Tokyo and Hiroshima religiously motivated? Nope. Yet in a single-day these events exceeded the war deaths of many pre-industrial wars. And how was this macabre leverage achieved? Through scientific expertise and execution... Hmmm...  <br /> <br />Dawkins does not include these historical facts in his social theory and because of that omission his argument needs reworking to include atheistic and materialistic violence. <br />Obvious!
B000J10ERO|1.0|Shoot Superman with a huge gun then when that doesnt work pull out your hand gun. Yeah right! Doctors try to prick him with needles. Hello! Supermans been around for awhile I think they should know it wouldnt work! Superman lies in a hospital bed and the army, and government isnt there?! No one breaking through the security guards to see Superman! This movie was pretty much a rehash of the original but a horrible one! Lois way too young. Even though Superman looked way too young as well Brandon Routhe(?) did a great job as superman. Plane scene was awesome and the only scene that got me excited during the movie. I could say more but I think its all pretty much been said pro or con.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|This album is good, but not great.  It falls below Fallen and Origin in quality.  I really think something's missing.  Perhaps it's Ben Moody's influence?  Definately worth buying, but don't expect this to be better than Fallen because it's definately not.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Anyone worried about the price of this set? I was. Until I started listening to the CD's that was. This set (as well as The Two Towers) is well worth the money. Shore's score is beautiful. Anyone who is a fan of the movies or the original scores should pick this up. You won't be disappointed.

Back to Dire Straits now, On Every Street is music for people with great taste and it has the monster arena hard rock anthem 'Heavy Fuel' which I repeat. <br />Just listen to this and be suprised to hear 'Heavy Fuel' as that will make you BANG!!

B000F7CMRM|1.0|I'm sure this movie is much deeper than I am.  It has to be because I just didn't get it.  I absolutely cared nothing for any of the characters.  Not because they were horrible actors or even characters.  It's just because the writer and director didn't care enough about ME to get me invested in anyone.  I still don't know what Clooney was doing or his motivation or anything.  I think the message was to convey how corrupt Americans are. SO excuse me if I like lights on in my house and gas in my car.  I don't mind movies with a political agenda, I really don't.  But how come these type of movies never offer solution to the problem?  Real solutions.  Instead, Syriana attempts to make me feel bad for being an American and owing a car.  I bet you Clooney isn't walking to place to place either.<br /><br />This movie obviously a rip from Traffic, but Soderbergh did it sooo much better.  I fell a sleep on this movie the first time and then had to watch the film an hour at a time the next go around.  My recommendation? Watch only if you're having trouble going to sleep.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's And Justice For All is certainly their best. I'm not a huge fan of Metallica but I like this album as this one was their greatest. I think the songs Blackened and Eye Of The Beholder are anthems and they rock AND I REPEAT THOSE. This great album should present in every rock fan's collection and I highly recommend this. Metallica are great and they rock.

B000031WBV|3.0|Well, here's the good: Rubinstein is far more adept than you or I will ever be at interpreting these pieces. His playing is rich, yet rather restrained. A bit too restrained at times. Now then, the bad:<br /><br />1. sound quality is in dire need of remastery. I can't emphasize that enough. While not as thick with background noise as the Cortot Box set recorded in the 30s and onward... It's still pretty thick, which bothers the hell out of me, making listening straight throughh almost impossible at times.<br /><br /> 2: only 8 (!!!) of the minor key Nocturnes are accounted for. I'm sorry, but the minor key pieces are VASTLY more interesting and varied and sensual and full of sturm und drang than the major key pieces. Three are missing, though I'm too lazy to go picking through and find out which 3 they are. Still, that's about 1/4th of the minor key NOcturnes: unaccounted for.<br /><br />That plus the issue of sound quality: I'll stick with my Claudio Arrau set, hushed breath and all, which I have had to purchase twice and which never fails to take me where I need to go.<br /><br />I love the Rubins, but still: Buyer Beware.
B000HIVQK8|5.0|5 star album but 2 stars for the remastering.I don't know about the rest of you but I was expecting great things with this remastered version. I put my vinyl edition onto cd sometime ago and track for track I'd listen to my lp to cd edition ANYTIME over the cd. It's not that the sound of the remastered cd is bad but side by side my lp to cd copy just sounds fuller and richer with much more bottom end bass. The sound fills my speakers whereas the cd just sounds too sterile and flat by comparison. For me the only highlights are the extra tracks which I had not previously heard before. As stated in an earlier review , the dvd is way too short ..I mean WAAAY to short for what extra you pay for the 'Deluxe' edition. I have all of George's solo stuff on vinyl so Conclusion: Hold on to your vinyl as this remastering business just does not impress on this occaison.
1401302378|3.0|This is a very well thought thru book and makes a lot of sense. I definately recommend it to people doing business on the net. Examples are good but a bit repetitive.

B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA's debut solo album \\"Liquid Swords\\" is an undeniable classic. The album is of the first wave of Wu-Tang solos from 1994-1996 following the legendary group album \\"Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers.\\" On that album, GZA was shown to maybe the group's best lyricist, a metaphorical master who lived up to his nickname of \\"the genius.\\" This album boasts multiple classic tracks, and it's got such a great feeling. The dark, gritty production gives it a cinematic feel, which is heightened by the dramatic kung-fu movie samples throughout the album. RZA handles the productive and it is awesome, completely fitting of GZA's amazing lyrics. The production is very similar to \\"36 Chambers,\\" RZA showing his signature style on the mixing boards. This album is only 13 tracks, but the tracks are all complete and it's a perfect length, not at all overblown like some later Wu releases would be. Almost the entire Wu-Tang Clan makes a guest appearance at some point on the album, so it's a group effort in some respects, but GZA always shines. Lyrically he is a beast, and this album may be his shining triumph. He uses battle-type rhymes often, full of great punchlines and also uses a lot of metaphors. He stays very true to the original Wu-Tang style though, often referencing kung-fu and chess in his rhymes. \\"Liquid Swords\\" is in my opinion the best Wu-Tang solo and a classic album, necessary for any fan of 90s hip hop or Wu.<br /><br />The album begins with the title track, which has a great organ-laced beat and GZA displays his addictive flow and nasal voice, shooting lyrical bullets. \\"Duel of the Iron Mic\\" is hard-hitting and well-produced by RZA. \\"Living in the World Today\\" is musically simple and lyrically complex, GZA boasts of Wu-Tang's prominence and is full of punchlines. \\"Gold\\" is an almost mafioso look at his lifestyle. \\"Cold World\\" has an awesome, almost disturbing chorus and GZA takes the opportunity for great storytelling. \\"Labels\\" is very clever, he uses all the record label names he can think of to almost make fun of them, I like this song a lot. \\"4th Chamber\\" is one of my favorites on the disc, it has an awesome beat and great verses from the Genius and Ghostface Killah, this is a Wu-Tang classic like the other \\"Chamber\\" cuts of old. \\"Shadowboxin'\\" is another classic, a collaboration with Method Man where the duo slays MCs with their Shaolin styles. \\"Killah Hills 10304\\" is another simply awesome song preluded by a funny interlude. \\"Investigative Reports\\" is so cool to listen to, GZA tells a paranoid view of the world and crime life. \\"Swordsman\\" is a metaphor-heavy representative track of his character, and \\"I Gotcha Back\\" is another of my favorites, GZA telling an eerie philosophy (\\"I gotcha back, but you'd best a-watch your front / `cause it's them n....s in front, they be pullin' stunts\\"). The last song is my absolute favorite, \\"Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.\\" This track is completely unlike any other on the album, so it's good that it was last on the album. It's a very conscious and relevant song by Killah Priest that tackles racial and religious disunity, looking to the children of the world and trying to find peace. The beat has an awesome, relaxing sample and a great vocal sample. I love the hook, this song just ends the album perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Liquid Swords\\" is a complete, well-rounded, and diverse masterpiece, unique and basically unlike any other album I have heard. Even among the Wu-Tang classics it shines as a legendary work, one that would never again be matched by GZA. This is one of those albums that I find something new I like about it every time, and I really don't find that in many albums that are released today. I strongly recommend the purchase of \\"Liquid Swords\\" to all passing hip hop fans, this is even one of those albums that could sell rap to a non fan. This is one of the essential albums that built the legend of the Wu-Tang Clan.n think of to almost make fun of them, I like this song a lot. \\"4th Chamber\\" is one of my favorites on the disc, it has an awesome beat and great verses from the Genius and Ghostface Killah, this is a Wu-Tang classic like the other \\"Chamber\\" cuts of old. \\"Shadowboxin'\\" is another classic, a collaboration with Method Man where the duo slays MCs with their Shaolin styles. \\"Killah Hills 10304\\" is another simply awesome song preluded by a funny interlude. \\"Investigative Reports\\" is so cool to listen to, GZA tells a paranoid view of the world and crime life. \\"Swordsman\\" is a metaphor-heavy representative track of his character, and \\"I Gotcha Back\\" is another of my favorites, GZA telling an eerie philosophy (\\"I gotcha back, but you'd best a-watch your front / `cause it's them n....s in front, they be pullin' stunts\\").

B00005JPCA|5.0|I am a big Bond fanatic and had huge reservations about Daniel Craig taking over the 007 role.  Casino Royale is my favorite of the Flemming novels [edging out Thunderball], so I have been waiting anxiously for a proper film treatment of the introductory story in the Bond canon, which made me all the more nervous about seeing the blonde Bond take the licence from Pierce Brosnan.  Well, mission accomplished.  Craig turns out to be the perfect blend of rough around the edges in the movie's opening third and then grows perfectly into the sort of Bond that we're used to seeing as the character is promoted and eases into his new slate as a 'double-o'.  The story is similar to the original novel, with Bond having to outwit LeChifre at a casino, though character names and some details of the actual characters are updated and shuffled to account for modern political situations.  The action sequences that begin and end the movie are spectacular, whereas the middle portion is where the character does the most developing as an espionage agent  This is a very long film by Bond standards, but it only drags a little near the end before picking back up again.  My trepidations were unfounded as Craig and company pull off the story and add to the fledgling franchise quite nicely.  The omages and nods to the series' long past are especially well done [variations on the vodka martini, Bond's preference to married women and his favored choice of vehicle].  The title sequence and accompaning song are superb [regrettably the main title does not appear on the movie soundtrack].    Add note; the second viewing was even more enjoyable as I was able to catch more the second time around.
B00000IPKE|5.0|A very good sample of Janis Joplin and her amazing melodic combinations and blues rock. These are some of Joplin's best known and best loved works.<br /><br />Some of my personal favourites include the charismatic blues Piece Of My Heart , the breezy Summertime , the contemplative Try (Just A Little Bit Harder), the hard rock Down On Me and Ball and Chain and the folk-style Me and Bobby McGee . Janis Joplin played an important role in the evolution of rock.
B000GPIPSS|3.0|the film itself is comparable to 1931 acting and is good in itself, however, don't look to the film to understand what the story of the novel is; it is completely different.
0553588486|2.0|I know a lot of people who love this series, but personally I can't stand it.  The first book is very depressing.  I'm told the second book is a lot worse.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|One of the most eagerly awaited releases of the year?  Well, maybe for a Beatles fan.  To be fair to Mr. Martin, the Love CD is a mixed bag of revelations.  I was under the impression that the original intent of this project was to present the music of the Beatles in a new light--the same way Zappa was doing (and his estate currently is) with his music:  remixing different snippets to make whole new songs.  When the father and son team of Martin actually sets out to do this, the results are nothing short of revelatory.  You need only to hear the \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" sequence to see this.  Other highlights:  Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing-inserting the Taxman guitar solo right in the middle was brilliant; \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" sounds like someone having a nervous breakdown; \\"Get Back\\" is reworked with that awesome drum solo from \\"Oh Yeah\\" on the Abbey Road album.   For the most part, the rest of the music seemed to be remixes whose sound quality, though much improved, was not that much different from the original fare.  Sure there are snippets thrown on at the end of some songs that make for some creative transitions, but these parts seem more like afterthoughts put in at the last minute to meet the obligatory standards that had been laid out in the advertisement of this disc in the first place.  In short, the CD is still a worthwhile purchase, if for nothing else the improved sound quality, but don't expect a comeplete retooling of the classics.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Evanescence has been through a lot since its major label debut \\"Fallen\\" rocked the charts in 2003. Songwriter/guitarist Ben Moody departed from the band on account of personal and creative differences with lead singer Amy Lee and has since moved on to work with other artists (Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson), and Lee herself has been at the heart of a well-publicized sexual harassment lawsuit. At long last, however, the band's long-anticipated \\"The Open Door\\" has arrived, having debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts.<br /><br />While Lee is flanked by talented musicians, she is now the indisputable centerpiece of the band, which was inevitable from the beginning. She wrote all the tracks either solo or in tandem with the band's new guitarist, Terry Balsamo, and staking a clear assertion of independence. From her impassioned vocals to her forthright lyrics, it is clear to see she has a lot to get off her chest.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" seems at once like yet another Kelly Clarkson radio hit, but this actually works well, striding the line between catchy pop and mainstream rock. Constant airplay has not diluted the song's appeal as it continues to air out Lee's frustrations with Shaun Morgan, her ex-boyfriend and lead singer of rock band Seether. \\"Lithium,\\" the second single, channels Sarah McLachlan with piano/vocal simplicity before the guitar riffs surge, beckoning the psychiatrist's couch with its deep, dark gloom.<br /><br />The album's opening track, \\"Sweet Sacrifice,\\" however, is extremely radio friendly, with a downright awesome hook and sharp lyrics to boot. Meanwhile, the lower-key duo of \\"Your Star\\" and \\"Like You\\" ruminates with such cryptic observations (\\"I'd like to be like you/Lie cold in the ground like you\\") that comparisons to the psyche of Emily Dickinson would be justified.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Weight of the World\\" paves the path for a new future, finding Lee declaring \\"I won't be held down by who I used to be,\\" while \\"Snow White Queen\\" recounts sexual abuse.<br /><br />\\"You belong to me/My snow white queen/There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over/Soon I know you'll see/You're just like me/Don't scream anymore my love, `cause all I want is you.\\"<br /><br />The album concludes starkly with \\"Good Enough,\\" finding Lee at her most vulnerable as she puts her guard down, declaring \\"I've completely lost myself and I don't mind/I can't say no to you.\\"<br /><br />Listeners who enjoyed \\"Fallen\\" will by more than pleased with \\"The Open Door.\\" The songwriting might not be as refined with Lee steering the ship almost entirely on her own, but she more than compensates for it with ardor and artistic devotion.abuse.    \\"You belong to me/My snow white queen/There's nowhere to run, so lets just get it over/Soon I know you'll see/You're just like me/Don't scream anymore my love, `cause all I want is you.\\"    The album concludes starkly with \\"Good Enough,\\" finding Lee at her most vulnerable as she puts her guard down, declaring \\"I've completely lost myself and I don't mind/I can't say no to you.\\"    Listeners who enjoyed \\"Fallen\\" will by more than pleased with \\"The Open Door.\\" The songwriting might not be as refined with Lee steering the ship almost entirely on her own, but she more than compensates for it with ardor and artistic devotion.
B000268QB2|5.0|This album has been out for quite a long time (2.5 years) and I'm just now getting around to listening. I do, however, remember hearing \\"Somewhere only we know\\" on the radio when it first came out and really liking it. And then all the comparisons started. I was informed if I liked Coldplay and Radiohead, I would like this. Well, the only problem is I'm always disappointed with Coldplay albums (only a few good songs IMO) and I've always been ambivalent about Radiohead. Therefore, I did not purchase the album. Finally, a friend of mine had the CD in his car on a roadtrip and I have to say - I was blown away. Every song is impeccable.  <br /> <br />The piano/drums/vocal dynamic is capable of being lush and intimate at the same time, which helps connect the listener to the music on a personal level. Chaplin's voice is surreal, almost other-worldly to me. I don't get why all the singers today insist on falsetto (especially when most of them sound like kazoos when they get too high), but Chaplin really does sound beautiful up there in the stratosphere and he helps bring these already good songs up to the level of greatness. The lyrics are at once melancholy but then uplifting and all the moods are facilitated by lofting choruses and melodies.  <br /> <br />After doubting them for so long, I now stand corrected, and this album has become one of my true favorites. <br />
B000002HRE|4.0|ReLoad was the first taste of \\"new\\" Metallica that i listened to. Its not as bad as people make it seem, but it doesn't compare to any of their old stuff. Then again, what band does? songs such as Fuel, The Memory Remains, and Slither still show that they are heavy. altough you can clearly see they are no longer a thrash metal band, to say they've gone soft is bull. Metallica will live on forever as one of the greatest Metal bands of all time.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I've always been a fan of the first two Superman films ever since I was a little boy who ran around wearing a towel pinned around my neck with a clothes pin and dreaming I could fly like Christopher Reeve.  I used to think that there was nothing more that could be done to the first two films to make them better (and nothing to save Superman III, IV, and Returns from getting any worse.  That's right, \\"Superman Returns\\" sucks!).  But what more could be done to \\"Superman II\\" to make it better?  Would we finally see the fabled Richard Donner scenes?  I won't go into all the details of the Donner/Producers fallout.  You can get all that information from other reviews.  I also won't go into any spoilers since you can also read that from other reviews and online fan sites.  The important thing here is to remember that this was the first attempt in the history of film to restore the original director's (Richard Donner) vision.  And boy was it a great one. <br /> <br />Sure, the Donner's cut has continuity issues.  But so does the theatrical \\"Superman II\\" and the orginal \\"Superman The Movie\\" (after you reverse time what happened to Lex Luthor's missiles?).  Anytime you mess with \\"time\\" in movies there will be continuity problems.  But for it's few flaws, the Donner Cut is superior! <br /> <br />The restored scenes between Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve are gems.  Anyone who appreciates great acting and writing will be blown away by these scenes.  They add so much more depth to the characters of Lois and Clark.  And who can ignore the power and depth of the restored scenes between father and son (Brando and Reeve, Jor-El and Kal-El).  We finally learn what happened to Clark that allowed him to get his powers back.  And while the ending is similar to \\"Superman The Movie,\\" (which was supposed to be the original ending to Superman II) it makes more sense than a \\"magic kiss.\\" <br /> <br />All in all, anyone who is a true Superman fan should see this version to make up theirown mind as to which film is their favorite.  But one thing is for certain.  The Donner Cut is a far deeper \\"Superman II\\" and far exemplifies why Christopher Reeve will always be our SUPERMAN!
B000J10ERO|1.0|The movie was OK, but it seemed better than OK because of it's stunning visuals.  Unfortunately, this is one of the worst jobs at mastering a DVD I have seen in ages.  Compression artifacts abound, colors are blah and banded, and every dark scene (which is about a third of the movie) is plagued with botchiness and muddling compression problems. <br /> <br />What a disgrace to the Superman legacy.  I've seen home movies with fewer compression problems than this thing.
B000065PUE|5.0|Let me begin by stating that Doolittle is perhaps my favorite record of all time. There's not anything even remotely close to a dud on these 15 songs. From start to finish, Doolittle is outstanding. Roughly half of this album appears on the band's best-of CD, \\"Wave of Mutilation\\" and the other half of the album could have been included. The album is so remarkably, consistantly strong that there is no reason to talk about highlights. Anyone who has even the slightest interest in this band, or indie rock at all for that matter, NEEDS to own this album!  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|Somehow, THE LOVELY BONES is both haunting and beautiful at the same time. Alice Sebold has crafted a delicate tale of death and the after-life, as told by a young murdered girl observing her family's grief and the hunt for her killer from the heavens. It spans so many genres and should be a moving read for most readers. For a more traditional mystery that is also extremely well-written while dealing with the kidnap, rape and murder of a young girl, try Martha Powers' DEATH ANGEL. It focuses on the struggle of a mother to find her daughter's killer among a close-knit community that is suddenly full of suspects.
B000HIVQK8|4.0|This is one of George's finest albums, and was released when his stock was really high, following the tremendous success of All Things Must Pass and the benefit concert for Bangla Desh.  In that context, this album was a bit of a letdown.  It lacked the grandeur and backlog of songs that ATMP had; and it likewise lacked the star power of Bangla Desh.  All these years later, it plays like one his most confident albums.  The success of his career up until that time gave him the confidence to write from his heart and produce himself.  It's that confidence that carries the day.  Just over a year later he undertook a disastrous tour, and his confidence took a great hit, which, along with being successfully sued for copywrite infringement for My Sweet Lord, took a lot out him.  It wouldn't be until 1979's \\"George Harrison\\" that he would put out another collection that would rival this in quality.<br /><br />Despite (or maybe, Because of) Harrison's confidence, it is a flawed album.  A co-producer might have been wise, as some songs need some help.  The band is good, obviously, but the arrangements seem to lack inspiration, and the sound is somewhat flat.<br /><br />Which brings us to the release.  No doubt overdue, I am somewhat disappointed with the sound.  It just doesn't sound like a huge upgrade over the 1990 version.  Maybe it just wasn't there in the original master, in which case they should have done a remix from the multitracks.  It still sounds pretty flat.<br /><br />Also, as with Brainwashed and bonus disc with the Harrison box, the \\"special edition\\" extra disc does not warrent the extra cost.  It seems that the powers that be know that Harrison fans will shell out for the extras, no matter what.  Instead of piecemealing out the Japanese concerts, why can't they just release a concert DVD?  Irritating to continue to just have teasers from those concerts.<br /><br />At any rate, I am very happy to have a quality reissue of this album.  The packaging is very nice, following the ATMP and Brainwashed \\"box\\" theme.  Very tasteful, very George.  Just wish the sound was better, but don't be misled.  If you're not an audiophile, you will enjoy this release very much. And, if you have the money, you will enjoy the packaging, the Give Me Love 1 song concert video, and the first (authorized) CD release of Deep Blue and Miss O'Dell.<br /><br />That leaves only George's two weakest albums, Dark Horse (hoarse) and Extra Texture that remain to get the re-issue treatment.  It's kind of anti-climatic when you save the worst for last.  However, I hope for their release soon so all of us Harrison fans can complete our collection.very nice, following the ATMP and Brainwashed \\"box\\" theme.  Very tasteful, very George.

B000H6SXMY|1.0|If you are new to friends, there is another complete collection contains all 10 seasons in individual original boxes and a plexy glass limited edition total box. the benefits of that set is, you have all the original DVDs in original boxes which are very good and secure DVD case. <br />In this newly release, DVDs are in sleeves which are open to surface damages and the set itself can easily be torn. there is only one bonus, the comemorative book which is not a big deal cause it's available to purchase individually
B000EWBKLC|2.0|This movie has a great plot but as it was one of the first released titles on Blu-Ray it has poor picture quality.   If you want to show off your new blu-ray player try to get some of the more recently released titles as they have much better picture quality.
B000002TQV|5.0|I am definitely a late bloomer to the Radiohead fraternity.    I just got OK Computer 4 months ago and after wrestling with it for a while, I became hooked and awed by it's brilliance.    Now I see, albeit almost a decade too late, what all the fuss was about.    I was so impressed that I decided to get \\"The Bends\\" about a month ago and further explore this immensely talented band.    I am once again in AWE.    There is not one bad song on this cd.    As a late bloomer to the fanbase, I actually never heard any songs from this cd until I bought it.    I heard the name \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and knew it was considered one of the better Radiohead songs, but never heard or just didn't remember it.    Out of 12 good/great songs with no filler, it's kind of hard to rate the tracks or pick favorites for me, especially since I've only had the cd for a month or so.    But subject to further scrutiny, I would say that the 2 best songs are \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and the closer \\"Street Spirit(Fade Out\\".    I expected alot from \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" after hearing it mentioned by so many fans, so it had a hard time because it had to live up to the hype for me.    Putting it mildly, it EXCEEDED the hype.    I haven't cried for years and with the breakup of my long term relationship recently, that song just resonated with me in an amazingly powerful way.    It is an all time gem, the last lines \\"If I could be who you wanted all the time\\" reduced me to balling tears more than once.    Street Spirit is a mesmerizing song, amazing, haunting, chilling, but in the end it's a triumphant and uplifting song with the closing lyrics of both the song and the album being a heartfelt positive final thought \\"Immerse yourself in love\\".    What a great album, If I had a gun to my head and had to pick a favorite Radiohead CD as a relatively new listener, I would choose \\"OK Computer\\" but not by much.    \\"The Bends\\" is the sheer, purely beautiful and melodic Radiohead whereas \\"OK Computer\\" is the brilliant, fully realized monolith of a CD that they may never top.    I am so glad I finally gave these guys a chance, my life will be forever changed because of it.    I am now a true and eternal fan.
B000JVT09C|3.0|This is a great movie but has one of the poorest picture qualities of all released Blu-Ray movies.   The picture is very soft and colors are muted.  I am pretty sure this is the way the movie was shot and not due to problems with the blu-ray format as the HD DVD version has the same problems.   Definitely not a title to be used for showing off your new PS3 or blu-ray player to your friends.
0743454537|3.0|Jodi Picoult wrote a novel dealing with an issue that is very topical today. The idea of the plot itself was very good and had an opportunity to be great. However, I did not think it was well executed. One thing that threw me off especially was the idea to have multiple narrators including just about all the main characters. This seemed gimmicky to me and left me wanting to hear from different people when she had another character narrating. Most of the characters developed well throughout the story and seemed consistent with the exception of Sara. Jodi Picoult used her as the villain in her story when I think she should have made people sympathetic to her situation. All in all I was drawn into the story and very surprised at the ending, though some of the end could have been left to the readers imagination.
B000GY729M|4.0|catchy vocals, guitars and a decent edge make tthis a likable alternative rock album by the Killers.  Admitedly, the lyrics are standard Christian-rock fare, but let's face it, it a pretty popular trend among today's bands.  I imagine they should be good live as well.
B000003N7K|5.0|This is a real treasure.  This album is about as romantic as you can get.  There is not one second of this album that disappoints.  I never grow weary of listening to it, especially at night with my girl by my side.  The only thing that is disappointing is the fact that it's not a very long album, however, besides that small detail, you can't go wrong making this purchase regardless of what kind of music you enjoy listening to.  This is one of those absolute no-brainers!  If you don't own this, go out and buy it right now, you won't regret it for a second.<br /><br />There is no doubt about it - Johnny Hartman is the greatest singer that never became famous in the history of man kind!  Okay, so it's a bit of a stretch... but after you listen to this album you will see why I throw out such lofty praise.
B000G0O5N2|4.0|Forget the previous review  bashing this disc for using Mpeg2. It was written by an obvious HD DVD zealot who knows not of which he speaks. Just about every professional reviewer that has seen this disc has given it high marks for picture quality, and I concur. There is no DVD player or upscaler in the world that will match this Blu-ray disc in picture quality, and that doesn't even take into account the excellent, uncompressed Linear PCM soundtrack! Superb! Forget about VC-1. Why does everybody want to squeeze everything down into the smallest space possible and throw information away? Because that is what the VC-1 codec does. Can it look good? Sure it can, but so can Mpeg2 - and this Mpeg2, mind you, is not the same 'old' Mpeg2, this is a new version of Mpeg2 with new extensions for authoring HD content.<br /><br />On a 50GB dual-layered Blu-ray disc such as this (HD DVD maxes out at 30GB, by the way), high bitrate Mpeg2 transfers can be and often are excellent, and quite transparent. This transfer looks completely natural. There are no compression artifacts apparent, film grain is true, and real, colours are natural, the blacks are deep and shadow detail is superb.<br /><br />So forget about what video codec is being used (Blu-ray can use Mpeg2, H.264/AVC or VC-1), don't let anyone try to convince you of the  'inferiority of Blu-ray and Mpeg2 ', and enjoy this excellent film on this superior high definition disc format.<br /><br />One other note, Amazon incorrectly lists Vin Diesel and Samuel L. Jackson as starring in this film. They are not in this film. I think they may have mixed up the credits with the film Pitch Black.
B00005JPCY|1.0|Wow, what a daring approach to terrorism they must have spent countless hrs to work that in so that it doesn't - god forbid - offend anybody. A lonesom guy with no affiliation or believes that would explain that motivation, just another faceless cookie cutter villain.     My main beef however is that time machine movies rarely work (with maybe the exception of Orson Wells classic) because there are no consequences that stick and it becomes painfully ovious when you get to see the same scene for the second or third time (especially when it wasn't particulary interesting the first time around).     Denzel might have tried this 100 times like groundhog day before he got it right and it doesn't matter, because its not a compelling story and the car chase gave me a royal headache
B000GYI32M|5.0|Okay, so season three of my favorite primetime soap opera, The O.C., wasn't nearly up to snuff with the spectacular first season and the slightly less spectacular second season. But, despite that, I still tuned in every Thursday night and when the DVDs were released, I bought them and relived the season again.<br /><br />While the third season was a bit of a letdown in a number of ways, I will say that a month into the fourth season, The O.C. has regained its form and is shining. It's just too bad that it is up against the two strongest shows on television, CSI and Grey's Anatomy. Despite all that, season four is looking to be the best season since the phenomenal first season.<br /><br />My opinion on why the third season was a bit of a letdown is the fact that creator Josh Schwartz seems to have taken a back seat in this season. He was the one with the vision for the show and its fantastic inaugural season and without him in his prominent position (or so it seems), the show wasn't quite the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the show continued to introduce unlikeable characters in the third season, much as they had in the first two seasons. This takes away from the great relationships that make the show so good, the Sandy and Kirsten, Summer and Seth, Ryan and Marissa and Julie and her man of the week, storylines.<br /><br />Season three picked up a short while after the shocking season two finale left off. As we left them, Marissa (Mischa Barton) had just shot Ryan's (Ben McKenzie) brother Trey (guest star Logan Marshall Green) as the two brothers fought. Fearing for Ryan's life, Marissa pulled the trigger just moments before Seth (Adam Brody) and Summer (the absolutely gorgeous Rachel Bilson) walked through the door.<br /><br />Trey had been nothing but trouble since his arrival in Newport Beach in season two. He had betrayed Ryan and the Cohen family, attacked Marissa and gotten into a boatload of trouble. The gunshot didn't kill him, but left him in a coma. Marissa's role in the shooting was questioned, as Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke), still reeling from the death of her second husband Caleb Nicol at the end of season two, tried to pay off Trey to implicate Ryan and spare Marissa. The ploy didn't work and Trey rode off into the sunset on a Greyhound bus.<br /><br />But, the implications from the shooting lived on, as both Marissa and Ryan were expelled from the Harbor School. While Ryan was readmitted, Marissa spent most of the season at Newport Union, the local public school, where she met even more people that would play a significant role in the rest of the season.<br /><br />The start of the season also found Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) in rehab, where she had been admitted at the end of season two, as Sandy (Peter Gallagher), Ryan and Seth tried to cope with her out of the house. Kirsten met Charlotte (guest star Jeri Ryan) in rehab and she would also play a big role in the early part of the season.<br /><br />The Marissa-Ryan story line again took some strange turns, as has been the case in the first two years. Her banishment to Newport Union found her hanging with new friends, particularly surfer Johnny (guest star Ryan Donowho), which brought out a little jealousy in Ryan. The two were on and off for much of the season, with Marissa hooking up with bad-boy Volchok (guest star Cam Gigandet), a former friend of Johnny's, after Johnny fell off a cliff to his death in front of Marissa, Ryan and Marissa's younger sister Caitlin (guest star and future series regular Willa Holland). His death also led to the introduction of his cousin Sadie (guest star Nikki Reed). Sadie and Ryan had a brief relationship, but his acceptance at college kind of turned things around as she headed off into the sunset. Marissa eventually returns to Harbor, thanks to a little help from an unlikely ally, Taylor Townsend (guest star and future series regular Autumn Reeser, who is Summer's top competition for most beautiful woman on television).<br /><br/>While Marissa was at Newport Union, her mother Julie was searching for a way to get back on her feet. Caleb's will left her with no money and because of that, her attempt to reunite with her former husband and Marissa's dad, Jimmy Cooper (guest star Tate Donovan) failed and Julie was forced to move into a trailer park, while Marissa bunked at Summer's house. Of course Julie wasn't down for long, as she quickly became cozy with Summer's dad Neil (guest star Michael Nouri) and the two became engaged near the end of the season. Julie and Kirsten also started a high end match making business that remains part of the show in season four.<br /><br />With Kirsten in rehab, the management of the Newport Group is left to Sandy and he finds himself caught between his morals and big business as he strives to build a new hospital. Kirsten's return home isn't all roses either, as she brings Charlotte to town and with that comes a whole load of trouble, as she tries to bilk first Kirsten and then Julie, out of money. She ultimately fails and disappears without a trace, thankfully. The hospital deal eats into Sandy's time and causes a lot of stress on his marriage. His decision to back out of the deal at the end of the season shows that he is back to the old Sandy.<br /><br />The core relationship in season three was the Summer-Seth storyline. With college on the horizon, Summer worries that Seth's desire to get as far away from Newport as possible will pull them apart. But, when Summer aces her SATs, much to Seth's surprise, the two apply to Brown together. Seth doesn't get in and not wanting to stop Summer from going, he breaks up with her. Of course, this devastates both of them, and comes to head at prom, where Summer tries to drink away her problems. Seth, determined to win back the love of his life, heads to Brown for student orientation, bound to find a way in. While there, he runs into Anna (guest star Samaire Armstrong), a blast from the first season past. While they can't concoct a plan to get Seth into Brown, Anna finds an alternative in the Rhode Island School of Design, and then proceeds to help Summer and Seth get back together again.<br /><br />As mentioned, this season continued the introduction of characters that just aren't likeable. Volchok and Charlotte come to mind as the two worst offenders. Johnny played the role of Oliver in season one, the person who came between Ryan and Marissa. Thankfully, all the characters were written out of the show at the end of the season or at the beginning of season four.<br /><br />The shocking finale (though it wasn't as shocking as it could've been had Mischa Barton not gone on television and told the world that she was being killed off), brought viewers back to the first season, as Ryan carried Marissa away from the burning car, much like he carried her out of an ally in Tijuana two years earlier. The effects of her death are felt strongly in season four, as the main characters try to carry on without her.<br /><br />This set had some interesting bonus features. The making of the Subways music video was a short piece on the band's appearance on the show. What's in a Name was an interesting feature showing how Josh Schwartz uses people he knows and staffers on the show to name characters on the show. There is a solid gag reel, a making of an episode featurette and an interesting take on commentary. Viewers listen to Schwartz and other staff members talk about certain scenes in two different episodes. It's not one whole episode of commentary, but it is still interesting to hear some behind the scenes stuff.<br /><br />While the show itself hit a bump in the road during season three, the DVD set was well done and the packaging was significantly better than that for season two. Now if only the ratings would pick up for an excellent season four, things would be all good in The O.C.ision). <br /> <br />While Marissa was at Newport Union, her mother Julie was searching for a way to get back on her feet.

B000IHY9SE|3.0|Any true hip-hop fan can tell you that fifty has fallen off since Get Rich or Die Tryin. But at least for the time being he's got my ear with this album. Eminem doesn't quite have as much relevant material as he used to but his presence on this album is enough to get it. As for the new artists, they are truly outshined by the Shady veterans. To me, the whole dirty south, ATL style doesn't mesh with Em and Fifty, so it just feels like these artists are being forced on the listener. Unfortunately the only Dre track on the entire album is a solo by Stat-Quo, but overall i would recommend this album to anyone that wants to hear some fresh, quality material from the Shady crew. When it comes down to it it's just a good filler until Nas finally drops.
032147404X|5.0|The shooting tricks mentioned by the author are very easy to understand and can be learn quickly.The book covers on how to shoot landscapes, flowers, weddings, sports, people and travel shots like a pro.The author also highlighted the importance of tripod and filters as they are some of the factors that makes the difference between snapshots and pro shots.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is into digital photography.
B000J10ERO|4.0|I wasn't sure that I'd like Brandon Routh as Superman.  Surprisingly, I did.  Christopher Reeve was a hard act to follow, but Routh managed to bring it off very well.  I loved the story line.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is because those levitation-looking maneuvers didn't look realistic.  They looked just like what they were, actors suspended on cables.  Tch, tch, tch.  Very disappointing. The other special effects were pretty good, I liked the 'red' X-ray vision and the fact that you could 'see' the body scan he gave Lois after she came out of the water.  What was with that VINYL \\"S\\"?  Sheesh!  We really could have done without that. I liked the other changes in the costume though...the lower cut briefs and color change for the belt and cape, very nice.  I don't know if it was the change in style of costume, but Routh appeared much better built than Reeve.  I wish the CD had had special features, but I guess I'll have to look into the 2-disc set for that.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|\\"This record is a little like equipping yourself with a Eurail card.  It's like saying, `I don't know where I'm going to go to on this trip. I'm just going to get on board the train, and allow each encounter to lead to the next.'\\"  So says Loreena McKennitt at her website, regarding her release \\"An Ancient Muse.\\"  Although gone from the recording studio for nine years, she shows that her clear, clean, beautiful voice has not suffered in the meantime.  Her \\"train trip\\" takes us back to the Middle East, for the most part, to explore the instruments, sounds and melodies of that area of the world, one that she has devoted to much study.  A side trip or two is in order (\\"The English Ladye And The Knight,\\" lyrics by Sir Walter Scott; \\"Penelope's Song\\" from Greece), but in all directions Loreena leads to unexpected places and auditory pleasures in her latest CD.  It's one of her best, and definitely worth adding to your collection.
B000JJRIO8|2.0|When an artist decides not to release a track its usually for good reason. Adding artist that were around 12 (TI and Ashanti) when he died does not make the track better. Overall the song is ok at best. I have to say this album is not worth of gracing Pac's name. IMO after Makaveli the albums just kept getting worse and this album falls right in line.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|The sophomore slump...it's a fate no band in the world wants to encounter after making a debut album that hits hard and sells millions of copies. Three Days Grace managed to capture the ears of millions of fans with their stomping hit single \\"I Hate Everything About You\\" and its follow-up crunchy anthem \\"Just Like You\\". While some may have dismissed the band as the \\"here today/gone tomorrow\\" variety, Three Days Grace were out to prove the critics wrong. Three Days Grace should silence all of its detractors with ONE-X, which proves to be a most satisfying listen from front to back. While they do intregrate some seriously melodic moments within the scope of these twelve tracks, they also inject some serious punch into their sonic assault. <br />Take for instance the first single, \\"Animal I Have Become\\", which is a seriously catchy alt-metal nugget with a sinister riff and a catchy beat, while the vocals hit home on a song about escaping the dark side you can't control. Indeed, a lot of the themes on the album address alienation, bad relationships, loneliness, but there's also some uplift in not only the words, as the title tracks' lyrics convey, but some serious shine to the music. \\"Pain\\", while slightly soft in the beginning, kicks into gear for a seriously crunchy gem that rocks as hard as anything else in this day and age. The melodic parts start to come into the forefront on the semi-acoustic \\"Never Too Late\\" and the lush title track, but on tracks like the old school metal of \\"Riot!\\", 3DG seriously will get you not only pumping your fist, but banging your head as well.  <br />ONE-X is a step forward for Three Days Grace, and a wake-up call to anyone who thinks that alternative metal is dying...on the contrary, thanks to bands like Three Days Grace and albums like ONE-X, alt-metal is reinvigorated, alive, and breathing better than ever.
B000FOQ1EA|5.0|Wonderfully played and recorded, it's simply fantastic that this set is now availble as a box set and at such a reasonable price.<br /><br />Funny, but I don't remember ever owning CDS of these recordings. Rather, I had them on ill-fated DCC Cassettes where they sounded wonderful (I was working at PolyGram when Philips released its digital compact cassette player and PolyGram folllowed with a number of titles in the new format. I was given a player by my boss who said, \\"please, get this out of my sight...and take that box of promo DCC cassettes with you!\\" His loss was my gain. Sadly, the technology never caught on, even though it was backward compatible to normal cassettes. With recordable CDs, DCC never had a chance).<br /><br />This set really has it all. Collectors are well advised to grab this before the trolls at Universal decide to once again snatch cutout defeat from the excellent recording jaws of victory.<br /><br />BTW - I don't agree with the negative comments posted here about the recording of the 6th. The lushness and clarity of this recording is quite stunning.
B000JRYNXE|4.0|you can really feel throughout her entire first solo album how into it she was and how much care and effort was put into making it the best it could be. in the sweet escape, you feel some of that originality in the tracks, but for the most part- the sweet escape doesnt live up to Lamb.  <br /> <br />good standout tracks include: Yummy, wind it up, don't get it twisted, early winter <br /> <br /> <br />the second single off of the album will most likely be orange county girl, which in my opinion isnt all that good... <br /> <br />cest la vie- im only giving it 4 stars because pharrell did a great job with beats on the album.
B000ION23A|5.0|I was gonna give ANT BULLY 4 stars, because I'm pretty stingy with 5 stars, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought... no, it deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />In this horrible and weak creative market that Hollywood has become, it's common place to forget movies these days, moments after watching them. You got the so, so's and the seen it a hundred times, the capitalizing off trend movies, the talentless talk of the town startlet movies, the kids want fart jokes movies and the hey, I'm independent and I'm cool movies and then there's movies like the ANT BULLY.<br /><br />It's been two or three weeks now and I still think about THE ANT BULLY. It wasn't perfect. The animation doesn't quite reach the quality of PIXAR, but this movie was the perfect combination of childlike humor and adult coolness. Not to mention, it taps into that childlike innocence that we all can relate to.<br /><br />You can relate to the bored kid destroying the ant hill in his yard. You laugh at the subtle humor as the ants cry with KATRINA DISASTER desperation as they ponder the fact that it'll take them a WHOLE DAY to rebuild everything. You smile as the Ants CRAVE and cherish the colored rocks (jellybeans) like they're the holy grail.<br /><br />Yet, it's the effectiveness of the camera shots and the humor that grabbed me. Particularly the shots of the dramatic scene unfolding as Lucas lights the firecracker in an attempt to blow up the attacking wasps... a huge explosion is coming... and it cuts to a wide shot of the yard... and a distant, faint pop and a small cloud of smoke. Also, the whole entire avoid the frog and escape from the frogs scenario was awesome. The wasps were cool too... almost... StarWarsish?<br /><br />Although I think it's the whole ANT BULLY package that had me feeling like a kid again, and for the first time in a long time, there was a movie that I remembered and thought about weeks later.
B000GGSMB2|1.0|I know the hip-hop scene is pretty much rooted with this movie as some kind of Bible.  But if were to get passed the fact that none of them are really gangsters, they would probably come to find that this movie is, in actuality, crap.<br /><br />If you want a long, drawn out explanation of why this movie is so bad, just search for the 1-star reviews.  They do a really good job of explaining.<br /><br />Now, I have absolutely no problem with violence.  I'm pretty sure that is the only reason why this movie is popular.  But if you want to watch a GOOD violent movie, watch/rent/buy \\"Natural Born Killers\\".  Not only is it absolutely disgusting, but it's actually interesting to watch.  \\"Scarface\\", on the other hand, is boring and contrived.<br /><br />Watching and acting like you love \\"Scarface\\" will not make you any cooler, it won't make you any tougher and it certainly won't make you more \\"gangsta\\".  It will just make you look like a lemming with really bad taste in movies.
B00005JPAM|4.0|In spite of my initial lack of interest in the subject matter, \\"The Queen\\" is a compelling, soundly character-driven movie. Many of the events are necessarily fictionalized (understandably, no one in the royal family has publicly spoken of this time), but regardless of its literal accuracy, you really feel like you were there when it all happened - like you're peering into a secret world.<br /><br />There's a strong emotional spine at the center of it - a public family struggling to reconcile their private grief with a very public one. It's a unique situation where age-old protocols are useless, and the royals have to make things up as they go along. Even if we can't directly empathize with this, Mr. Frears gives it an emotion that's clear and powerful.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent.  As it should be, any weaknesses in the actors' resemblance to their real-life counterparts is made a moot point.<br /><br />Though well-paced, this is a film about restraint, and as such, may require a bit more patience.  Audiences who can accommodate a quieter piece will be richly rewarded.
B000002UAU|5.0|Oh, where to begin with this album...  There are no real words to describe it.  I was a mild Beatles listener when I first heard the '1' compilation album and the White Album.  Those are both great discs, of course, but when I heard Sgt. Pepper...  It shook me in a way I can't describe.  Each track oozes with its own type of magic and wonder, and if you listen in just the right way, you can almost feel yourself drifting away to Pepperland...  Some may argue that Revolver is a better album, but I say that Revolver is merely #2 to this masterpiece of an album. <br /> <br />If you have even the slightest interest in the Beatles at all, buy this album.  You will not regret it.
0143034901|3.0|The last 100 pages of this book were exceptional, unfortunately, the 375 leading up to it were tough to get through.  I was hoping for a book that I couldn't put down, and this wasn't it, despite such positive reviews.<br /><br />While I did want to read the whole book to get the whole story, and while I did find the ending very satisfying, the read up to the end was tough to make it through.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book, but I'm not sorry that I read it.
B000J103WK|5.0|This concert only made me wish that more bands would produce HD-DVD concerts. The sound and PQ is amazing. If you have a decent digital surround system which is set up correctly, you will feel like you are in the front row watching the concert live. You can never go wrong with the Eagles, and this HD-DVD does not disappoint fans.
0321334876|5.0|This book is a classic. The 55 advises can certainly be found in other books but the strength of this book is in how the author walks you through intelligent explanations on why it is wise to follow the advise. Beside, the writing style of the author makes the reading of this book as enjoyable as reading a good novel.<br /><br />This is highly recommended as you will learn while having fun.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The movie invites us to act, to recycle, to make better choices. Fine, I agree and I'm trying to do my bit. But I am afraid this will not be enough. We need drastic measures and very fast. We need to force the governments to take drastic measures. How do you force governments to act ? Let's get together and demonstrate, let's get involved into politics even if we never have up to now, let's take to the streets.
B000005RQT|4.0|In Rock say's it all. <br />This time around they change the whole band from 60's trippy music to 70's full blown thunder rock. <br />Nice name, cool album cover and better music. <br />Kicking In with the (MARK II) phase of there career and it looks like they made a good choice in changing the line up. <br />Ian Gillan and Roger Glover step in and the band wants to start in a new direction. <br />Sabbath and Zeppelin turned it up and the Deep does also. <br />From the start it rocks with Speed King and keeps going until you get to Child In Time where it mellows down a little. <br />Flight of the Rat kicks in and shows just how great this band Jams. <br />The album never lets up and in my mind closes with the best tracks. <br />Living Wreck and Hard Loving Man...these songs ROCK and Deep Purple is one of the best at Rocking/Jaming and completely letting it all lose. <br />As for the Bonus tracks: <br />We got the Single Black Night which was a hit (I THINK) and a pretty good rocker. <br />We also got another version of Speed King (Piano) which was released as an A-SIDE somewhere in Europe. <br />And some studio chatter (don't know why) and some remixes of classics from the ALBUM/CD. <br />A First Day Jam session and a track or two that never were released until now. <br />It's all good and well worth the money. <br />Buy it, put it on 10 and tear the roof off and let the people who have forgotten what real rock is get a good listen. <br />Hopefully newer bands will start making music like this again (I Think I'm Getting Old!) <br />I'm only giving it a four... because as great as it is... it ain't better then Machine Head!
B00005JNS0|3.0|The first time I tried to watch this movie I turned it off after about 15 minutes.  The beginning of this film is one long torturous session with \\"Lightning McQueen\\" who is to me the most non endearing character ever in any Pixar movie.  One dumb gag and cliche after another, and some genuinely bad writing, like when McQueen says \\"I'm a one man show\\".  Hey, there is no \\"man\\" in the Cars universe, so why would a car say something like that?<br /><br />Thankfully I gave it another chance and decided to watch it on my little flatpanel while walking on my treadmill.  The movie starts to really move when it slows down.  The 116 minutes is considered by some to be too long, but it added a lot of time for character development, and McQueen needed to develop a lot of character.<br /><br />To be brief, the beautifully rendered little world of Radiator Springs and its assortment of cute -- if rather one dimensional -- characters provided a context for McQueen to accept responsibility for his actions, grow up, and start thinking of vehicles other than himself.  The Porsche saved the movie for me.  She at least had some depth.<br /><br />I liked \\"Doc\\" too.  His story added another lesson to the story, that is, don't discount those who came before you. They're smarter than you think.<br /><br />I found the ending rather predictable (I was sure what would happen, but I just didn't know exactly how it would happen), but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie.<br /><br />So, three stars for a decent morality play and some mind bogglingly beautiful animation, and a tribute to motoring history.  Two stars off for shallow cliche characters (or should I say car-actors) and for having tons of eye-candy but a dearth of adult humor, and by \\"adult\\" I mean genuinly subtle and funny humor, not crass toilet humor.  With all it's strengths, Cars was a difficult movie for me to emotionally bond with, unlike the other Pixar films.<br /><br />Oh yeah, how is it that McQueen left Radiator Springs with whitewalls and that solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.  Did I miss something?<br /><br />And, in real car racing you don't get to purposely collide with other cars and knock them off the track.  Chick Hick would have been banned from auto racing and likely charged with a felony in the real racing world.  They went so far to duplicate the realism of NASCAR, and I know cars sometimes touch, but it ain't supposed to be roller-derby, is it?<br /><br />The bonus featurs are fun, like the \\"One Man Band\\" cartoon and the extra \\"Cars\\" cartoon.  The \\"deleted scenes\\" are storyboard style but show how the movie could have been done differently, which I found quit interesting.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD just seems like \\"round one\\".  A year from now there will likely be the \\"Special Two-Disc Ultra Ka-Chow\\" version with multiple commentaries, documentaries, etc.  So, if you buy this version, I think you'll likely be buying Cars again.solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.

Open your minds to the true creative genius that went into this work of art, not to mention one of the greatest natural voices of our age!  I truly appreciate the fresh direction that Josh has taken with this new CD and think it's his greatest work yet!  Keep up the good work, Josh!  You are truly one of a kind and I encourage you to keep evolving!!
B000J10ERO|4.0|Superman returns was one of my favorite movies this season. With its intense action, suprise twists, and suspencful sequences, Superman returns really did fulfill the anticipation of the American public. Although, Hollywood did put a little to much emphasis on Superman resembling a Christ-like figure, Superman was made entertain you and that is exactly what it did.
B000AYEL1A|2.0|Poor Barbra. <br /> <br />The best part of the DVD is her comments; they are beyond over-the-top to show how her sense of reality is gone.  Yes, she is literate when talking about design and lighting and casting; but from her tone you would think she made a film to challenge Ingmar Bergman. <br /> <br />Instead this is a film so bad and so banal; she is basically playing herself--an unsympathetic woman who can sing her a** off.  At no point do we know why she and Kris fall in love with each other.  At no point does she seem at all sympathetic or even grateful for her success. <br /> <br />And why doesn't Kris get to write and sing his own songs??? <br />
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book!!!  It evoked more emotion in me than any book I have ever read.  At one point I had to put it down, even though I didn't want to, because I became so angry at the mother and how she viewed her unborn child Anna.  I did see the events leading up to the end, but the very last chapter was touching and surprising.  The characters in My Sister's Keeper are full of emotion and questions and the whole family could very well fit into today's society.  Put in that type of situation I don't know what I would do, I don't think that anyone could make a call on it until experiencing it first hand. <br />I would say this is a must read, a page turner that you will have trouble putting down.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|UFO typified the best elements of hard rock, but often came across as generic and derivative.  To some extent that might have been true, but they were a prolific, hard working band, their songs were good, and they played them like they meant it.  Strangers in the Night brings the best of it to the stage.  A lengthy album, remastered and extended to include two additional songs, this CD reminds UFO fans why they were fans to begin with.  It's a relentlessly energetic concert that surrounds the listener with the excitement of both the band and the audience.  Clearly UFO played with such singular conviction because they had no other choice.  As well as a great live performance, Strangers in the Night also serves as a fine \\"best of\\" CD.  If you're just getting acquainted with UFO, there's no better album to start with.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|First off, let me say I'm really surprised to see this album get such mixed reviews, although most are extremely positive.  I have the utmost respect for everybody's opinion...but I'm a little griped about some of these awful reviews.  Reviews given apparently by huge Incubus fans.  Let's set the record straight.  This is a band that is fully standing the test of time and only seems to get better and better.  But if you know this band at all, what you DON'T do is go buy their latest album EXPECTING a certain sound.  If you do, you probably will be let down.  Incubus is not cookie-cutter design group.  They are far too smart and a large pool of talent to stick to the same sound. <br /> <br />They will always reinvent themselves, keep it fresh and find a way to be creative.  And you just have to love that about a band in an age where everybody pretty much sounds the same.  Who sounds like these boys???  Nobody...ever has or ever will. <br /> <br />Alright, now that I've got the rant out of my system, onto Light Grenades! <br /> <br />I'm a huge fan of this album.  Like its predecessors, the first listen was a warm up, and I recognized that yet again...\\"this is different for Incubus.\\"  Many thought ACLOTM was a let down, I'm still baffled by this.  Next to SCIENCE, it's my favorite album.  But this cd is outstanding work, and is right up there with those two. Music wise, how can you complain with Mike playing the axe.  The man is brilliant, and he again and again impresses me.  The rest of the band is in full force as well, although I'm still listening for Kilmore on the records more.  But he does a lot more than just 1's and 2's now. And this album seems to be the most personal of all writings by Brandon...which adds to its power. <br /> <br />Summary of tracks <br /> <br />1. Quicksand -  \\"Ok...the monster is awake...\\" Just an intro track...but it does its job.  It sets the mood and tone for the whole cd.  \\"Some people fall in love and touch the sky, some people fallin love and find quicksand.\\"  You can tell Brandon has some heartbreak to share this time around. <br /> <br />2. A Kiss to Send Us Off - My favorite easily so far. A melodic riff comes in that is addicting and is followed by some classic Incubus grunge.  As the album seems to revolve around the subject of love, this song hits home for me as I feel it will for many.  \\"Just one...more...tongue...kiss before the sky it falls...out...from...this cloud we're hovering on.\\"  Painfully beautiful <br /> <br />3. Dig - A well chosen single to follow Anna Molly.  This song will gain many new Incubus fans, and will rub long-standing fans in a special way.  Like Quicksand, this song lets you know that Incubus has evolved yet again in the best of ways.  \\"We all have something that digs at us...at least we dig each other.\\"  Very poignant lyrics.  This song feels to me an anthem for best friends, and Brandon talks of camraderie being the message.  This will be a favorite to many. <br /> <br />4. Anna Molly - The first single, and for good reason.  Full of energy, speed and emotion.  There is a longing in Brandon's vocals that speaks volumes, while the lyrics are left to much interpretation.  Fans that have trouble adjusting to the band continually evolving their sound will cling to this song a while until they finally open up.  <br /> <br />5. Love Hurts - A great ballad.  Many reviews find this to be the low-point of the album, but across the board I've found it be a personal favorite to many.  A very simple song lyrics wise...\\"without love, I won't survive.\\"  A song purely about love, how it can be a blessing and a curse.  In this aspect, I don't see how it couldn't be a fan favorite cause almost anybody can relate to it. <br /> <br />6. Light Grenades - I love this song, and almost feel it would've been a better first single.  It has the same ability as Anna Molly to grab old-school fans and make them excited for the album, but if I hadn't heard much Incubus and heard this song on the radio I would be instantly obsessed with the band!  Going back to the days of SCIENCE, this song has an infectious groove, is urgent and its pace is so much fun to keep up with.  Brandon has fun with his lyrics, and you can tell.  Defintely one of my favorites. <br /> <br />7. Earth to Bella pt. 1 - I love how these guys pick the right time to slow things down, let you settle after such an energetic song and come back down to earth.  Ahhh but the best part?  It doesn't stay soft for long, when Mike comes crashing in with some thrashing guitar work while Brandon proclaims \\"I'm ok to sink...\\"  A short but sweet song, and a great seguay to the next track. <br /> <br />8. Oil and Water - This song really impressed me lyrics wise.  It's hard to resist a song that is so relative lyrically.  The rhythm and tone of the song takes me back to Morning View, Mike and Jose really do a great job here.  \\"Babe, this wouldn't be the first time, and will not be the last time...there is no parasol that could shelter these weathers.\\"   <br /> <br />9. Diamonds and Coal - If I were forced to pick a least favorite track, personally I guess it would be this one.  I love the song, and the aformentioned opinion will most likely vanish in a week.  At first it comes off too simple and redundant.  But once you get the message of the song, you realize the importance of repeating the title.  \\"In spite of this, we're doing just fine, even diamonds start as coal. Give us time to shine, even diamonds start as coal.\\"   <br /> <br />10. Rogues - This one to me took a page from ACLOTM, which is a wonderful page to take from to me.  The guitars are infectious, drums are tight and kicking.  \\"Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution! The ripple effect is too good not to mention. If you're not affected then you're not paying attention!\\" Mike busts out a killer, funky solo which will make many fans smile. <br /> <br />11. Paper Shoes - A wonderful song, again a little different for Incubus, which is why I love it. \\"You're about as reliable as paper shoes in bad weathers, but the pain will roll off water on feathers.\\"  Very melodic, and the drums are superb. <br /> <br />12. Pendulous Threads - An earlier reviewer wrote something I agree with on a certain level.  I feel this should've been the end track, cause this song packs some punch.  I love Earth to Bella pt. 2, but I would've pulled a switcheroo with the two tracks.  It doesn't take anything away from either song however.  Next to track 2, as of now this is tops in my book.  Mike gets in your face with some sharp guitar work, and builds to the bridge.  This is another song that harkens back to ACLOTM and SCIENCE simultaneously.  The drums and bass are intense, and if the band is as smart as I think they are, they will HAVE to play this song live cause the energy is undeniable. It would have been the perfect ending to this album, just like it had the perfect beginning. <br /> <br />13. Earth to Bella pt. 2 - I love this song, its just a note I wouldn't end an album on.  \\"Don't you want to see the deep, it's not that hard...\\" Still a great song, indeed. <br /> <br />Any true Incubus fan just has to show a lot of respect for this album, while it has some sounds from past works, it is still amazingly fresh and different for the band. Just really listen to it, the entire way through...more than just once or twice.    <br /> <br />Outstanding songs - A Kiss to Send Us Off, Dig, Light Grenades, Rogues, Pendulous Threads <br /> <br />\\"Sleeper\\" songs (songs that you will end up loving the more you listen) - Love Hurts, Earth to Bella 1+2, Oil and Water, Paper Shoes <br /> <br />I gave 4/5 stars cause I couldn't give 4.5...which is what I really feel.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I have been a Bond fan for a couple years now. I have seen several of the films, and seen many actors play Bond. Until a few days ago, I would have had to say no one could ever beat Pierce Brosnan. I still think Brosnan is great, but Craig is even better. The action is hot, heavy and brutal, the emotions are raw, well acted and wonderfully scripted in, and the story is involving, complex, and easy to follow. <br /> <br />If you have the slightest interest in Bond films, you have to see this.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm not a hard core beatles fan as many of the people reviewing here but I am a fan. From a younger persons perspective I would say that \\"Love\\" is much more appealing then the current CD issues of Beatles albums. Those having grown up when the Beatles actually existed and listening to vinyl might be used to less then perfect clarity in recordings and Im sure some would say that its 'its the way the songs should be heard' but these new releases sound great, the continuous mix is a great way to listen to some of the Beatles best tracks.  <br /> <br />As good as this band may be their staple fans are getting older, and it's not a bad idea to update their sound slighty, as long as its done in the right way - as it has been here. This is as good a 'new' album as your likely to get. I think within the context that this album was created - as a soundtack - it is great, and the fact it is proving so popular just shows the beatles are still relevant. If nothing slightly 'new' were ever released where do you think the beatles music would be in 50 years? It may be timeless but nobody can say where music will head and given the current state of things it isnt promising. At worst this album will annoy some old fans, at best it will make new people appreciate the great music of the Beatles.
B000062X90|2.0|I was tipped off to Wishbone Ash from an article I read about Steve Harris (Iron Maiden) who credited this band as being one of his earliest and biggest influences.    I bought their self titled debut album and this one from Amazon based on that article and also because both of these albums were well received by reviewers.    Maybe I read too much into the article or perhaps this was just another spur of the moment purchase, but I think these albums would better suit 1970's rock fans per se i.e. a fan of the period than those who prefer the harder style of rock that would emerge from the mid to late 1970's.    The album does have its moments, and there are some really nice melodies and some nice guitar/bass work, but it too often drifts into that very early \\"happy happy\\" 1970's sound that marked the transition from the 1960s to the 1970's.    I guess that should be expected, since this album was released only two years into the turbulent new decade at the close of the flower power hippie period.    The use of the twin guitars a noteworthy feature, since this band is also credited as an early pioneer of this style of rock.  The bass is unusually active for this period and doesn't just settle for simple changes, which would make sense, since they did influence Steve Harris after all.    I prefer this album to their debut, but it does make me think of an English version of the Eagles if there ever was such a thing.  Not that that is a bad thing.    I am a fan of 1970's rock and I think this decade produced some fantastic guitar/bass rock, but this is just a little too 70's for my tastes.    If you are new to Wishbone Ash as I am, but are basically a hard rock/metal fan at heart, try looking for MP3 versions on the web and just test drive one or two songs before you decide on buying a complete album.
B000J103YI|5.0|Jennifer can SANG, what a great CD, all the music is good.  I can not wait to see the movie next week, and i can not wait for Jennifer hudson to come out with a CD. Jennifer Hudson made the soundtrack sound great, Bouncey is ok.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|While \\"Leviathan\\" set new standards for nearly everyone and topped many \\"album of the year\\" lists, \\"Blood Mountain\\" tackles it and gives it a noogie.  There's really not much I can say about this modern metal marvel that hasn't already been said. Topping a masterpiece? Already been covered. Worries of selling out? Nope. The switch to a major label? Well, I won't even go there.   <br /> <br />The kicker here is that while they've made a better album than \\"Leviathan\\", the music here is almost twice as challenging,  therefore making it a little less accesible for folks new to the band. And with there being so much publicity, there will most certainly be plenty of newcomers.  Okay.  With that being said, let me just say this:  While there have been some most-excellent releases this year (LOG,KSE,CONVERGE,etc.), YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER METAL ALBUM THIS (or probably any other) YEAR.   <br /> <br />From the moment you tear off the plastic and pop it in your player, \\"Blood Mountain\\" will take you places you've never even dreamed of.  Yes, that may be a bold claim, but wait till you hear the very opening of \\"The Wolf is Loose\\".  The band start in at full throttle and carry the momentum on through to \\"Chrystal Skull\\" right before slowing down a hair for \\"Sleeping Giant\\".  This song alone is reason enough to buy the album as it is one of the most atmospheric tracks to ever hit my ears. Tailor made for headphones. \\"Capillarian Crest\\" (the first single) is a spectacle in itself and much like the rest of the album, will demand repeated listenings.  <br /> <br />There's a bit of a curveball with \\"Bladecatcher\\" and on the first listen, you may find yourself checking to see if the cd is skipping, but you will be richly rewarded.  Josh Homme makes a cameo on \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" and even though I aint all that big on QOTSA, his vocals give the tune an extra dimension.   <br /> <br />In short, what this all adds up to is a musical experience like no other, that will demand your full attention as well as multiple listenings. (I've been all over it since release date and I'm still finding something new with each listen). It's a front to back album that will require no skipping.   <br /> <br />If you aint heard it by now, then you must drop what you're doing right this minute and RUN to pick it up.  You can thank me later.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This type of music, this type of performance, is not usually my cup of tea, and I only chanced upon it while channel-surfing through a spate of commericals during a college football game. All I can say is thank God for remote controls. I was smitten in minutes and have watched the repeat of this performance four times in the last four days. Yes, I am newly in love, crushed as goofily, giddily and gratefully as I was back in my schoolboy days, but I profer this with no sexist agenda at all: First, these ladies are sinfully gorgeous --each looks like she may just have stepped off the pages of a fairy tale (most appropriate, given the backlit castle set looming up behind them); Secondly, they move with the willowy grace of the wind through an Irish meadow. Third, and most importantly, collectively and individually, they sound precisely like what I expect (what I hope)to hear when the Pearly Gates swing open for me, a sound majestic, angelic, soaring and soothing. Some things are achingly beautiful: \\"Danny Boy\\" (moved me to tears), \\"Somewhere,\\" \\"Beyond the Sea\\", but I found everything to be enthralling and enchanting, hypnotic and mesmerizing, delivered with seamless grace and charm, touching elegance and class.<br /><br />I've read some negative reviews here. I find that somewhat discouraging. In a world in which \\"femininity,\\" so-called Girl Power, is cynically and crudely represented by the rephrehensible likes of The Pussycat Dolls, Brittney (sp?) Spears, Madonna, Gwen Stefani (sp?), and those of similarly sleazy ilk, these women, their voices, their performance, is like a lilting breath of proverbial fresh air.  I don't know how hard-hearted or headed one has to be the regard this aural and visual splendor with anything other than an adoring eye, but I'm glad I'm not there yet. One of the best, nicest things I've seen anywhere in ages. Bravo. Bravo! BRAVO!!
B000JJRIN4|4.0|The Sweet Escape really feels like a sequel to Gwen's debut solo album. It's not quite as good as the original, but it has lots of references to the first and depends too much on the success of her first album. \\"Wind It Up\\" is clearly the closest this album will get to \\"Hollaback Girl\\", though nothing on here is as good as that hit or any of the other hits from Love Angel Music Baby. I have to admit that \\"Wind It Up\\" has really grown on me, though. It's a very catchy song. Other tracks that I like are \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\", which remind me of \\"Cool\\", and \\"Now That You Got It\\" and \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\". I'm pretty sure that most fans of Gwen Stefani and those who enjoyed the first album will like this one. However, none of the tracks strike me as particularly innovative or inspired. A lot of them come off as Love Angel Music Baby leftovers. Don't get me wrong, it's not that this album sucks, but maybe it's time for her to go back to the studio and start recording with No Doubt again.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|Eminem Presents the Re-Up is a decent cd. There are some serious FIRE tracks here. The lesser known acts on this cd do a decent job here. In my opinion, if they are truly the \\"featured\\" artist on this cd, then Eminem and 5o should have stayed away. These two outshine the new artists on this cd making it hard to listen to the new artist when 50 and Em's tracks are so hot. This is worth the buy just to hear these two! Why doesnt 5o cent always rap with this much heat?
B000JJRIN4|3.0|I love Gwen and everything about her. And most of the songs on this cd are alright. But I liked Love Angel Music Baby better. Some of these songs, esp the ballads, just seem boring. Plus in the rap songs, I hate when she raps about herself. I like when Gwen sings about things that lets you know that she feels the same way that you do - trying to get through life and stuff. But constantly singing about grammys and lamb and all her fans, it just seems fake. Too narcassic. I still love her, but I feel like her ego got the best of her on this one. The songs are hollow. And 'breakin up' is un-listenable. Its so irritating. Plus why is she wearing that wig all the time? I dont get how the sound of music goes with the michelle piffer look. <br /> <br />BUT I do love Gwen. I'm hooked and always interested. This is just the first time I'm questioning some of her choices cause I'm really struggling to understand if she's doing all this cause she loves this music, or she knows pop culture will love it and give her big hits and grammies (no different than fergie or nelly furtato).  People like to compare her to madonna, but madonna always did different things than what was popular at the time. she never sold out. and i'm afraid gwen might have just to have a hit.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Not a bad soundtrack compilation.  Though not quite as good as BOUNCE, which also features dido as well as some other suprisingly great tracks.
B000002TYX|5.0|Of the three Beatles Anthology volumes, this first one is easily the most exciting for Beatles fans and collectors.  The idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics, and present alternate takes, working versions, live renditions, all of which are being released here for the first time.   <br /> <br />This volume takes fans back to the very beginning, to 1958's \\"That'll Be The Day.\\"  What a thrill.  Then we hear home demos that were recorded in Paul's garage.  This is followed by the material recorded in Hamburg with Tony Sheridan.  We are treated to five selections from the Beatles' Decca Audition.  Even if it wasn't the greatest tape the Beatles could've made, I'm sure Decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the Beatles!   <br /> <br />It gets better and better as time goes by.  The Beatles sang \\"I'll Get You\\" at the London Palladium in 1963, and \\"All My Loving\\" on Ed Sullivan in 1964.  Both of those recordings are presented here.  Other highlights include: <br /> <br />*One After 909 - I actually prefer this version to the one that got released in 1970. <br />*Eight Days a Week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well.  Also the false starts were interesting. <br />*How Do You Do It - the unreleased single. <br />*Free As A Bird - a new Beatles masterpiece. <br /> <br />Die-hard Beatles fans will not be disappointed with this set!
B000IJ79WU|4.0|This is the version that should have always been, the tone matches the first Superman movie in every single detail. It has erased the shoddy quality of the Lester cut for me. Well done, Dick and Tom.
B000I2JKC4|5.0|This is among my favorite Christmas films.  This and \\"A Christmas Story\\" (also just released on HD DVD).  A Christmas classic, and there really aren't all that many.  It just gets better and better each year!  Love the Yuppies next door.      I've previous owned the VHS tape, the LaserDisc and the standard DVD of this film and this newly released HD DVD is by far the best!  Not a speck on it.  Beautifully restored... I'm really impressed with it's quality.      On my 46\\" Sony LCD widescreen it is a the total theatre experience, but I doubt that it ever looked this good in a theatre.  The detail, color and sound is just awesome.  The image fills the 16 by 9 inch screen.      If you don't know this movie, it is just terrific.  From a script from John Hughes, it is just nasty enough to have the proper edge.  It is also a wonderful Christmas movie!!!    If you have an HD DVD player, just order this!
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Hello Folks,  I want to thank MGM  for this release....they really got it right!  first off...  all the excellent bonus features from the 25th Anniversary edition..  the 30 minute on camera commentary by Stallone, the tributes to Burgess Meredith, the cinematographer James Crabbe and Bill Conti..ALL made it to this edition...which means you don't have to hold onto older inferior editions to have all the bonus features...and this IS a big deal.  Too many recent DVD editions of movies lose old features which make keeping mutliple copies essential and that stinks.  The extra features are really too  many to list...multiple commentaries..and the Stallone alone is worth the update...its truly like watching the movie with him  in  the room...WOW!  all the past trailers...the appearance on  the Dinah Shore show..featurettes...this is a NO BRAINER for fans of the movie.    The three part \\"making of\\" which runs about an hour and half and  features the main players is extraordinary in its revelations about the movie and the craft of making movies and WHY this was a million to one chance and WHY their lack of budget actually helped  in  many ways.  The twenty minute documentary on the Steadicam and its inventor ...who filmed his demo on the art museum steps before heading to Hollywood....its just proof that all the planets lined up for this one!  For those out there bitching about the upgraded releases of DVDs...don't buy em...for those of us who love the movies...these higher quality releases are very welcome.  I  picked this 2 disc set up for $15 at Target...and there are hours of features...WHAT A DEAL!    If you love the movie...get this version.  if you don't care about bonus features...stick with your old copy.
0375836675|5.0|Markus Zusak might be my favorite author now, and I've read a lot of books by a lot of authors. I have not, however, read three books of such magnitude by the same author. Upon completing GETTING THE GIRL, THE BOOK THIEF, and now I AM THE MESSENGER, I sit back in awe at the mastery of the writing, the power of the message, the truth of such stories.<br /><br />Winner of the 2003 Children's Book Council of Australia's Book of the Year Award and nominated for best young adult book at the 2006 L.A. Times Festival of Books, I AM THE MESSENGER (or THE MESSENGER in Australia) tells the story of Ed Kennedy, nineteen-year-old taxi cab driver and all-around average guy. In fact, he's the epitome of average -- faithful friends, stinky dog, dead-end job, and girl who loves someone else.<br /><br />That's why it's such a big deal for Ed, Marv, and Ritchie to get trapped in a bank during a stickup. One of the thieves gets spooked, drops his gun, and somehow Ed ends up with the weapon and the town's praise. That might be a winning hand for Ed if he doesn't receive the first mysterious playing card, the Ace of Diamonds in his mailbox. It's a card with a message for him to deliver. Or else.<br /><br />Messages like Ed's will change a person, if he or she lets them. That's the beauty of Zusak's story. Ed discovers the changing power in simple, personalized messages of love, even if they're ones he's forced to deliver. While I could imagine a cynical reader calling Ed's 12 messages a tad forced, I would differ with them on every case. Ed's stories are simple proof that if a \\"guy like him can stand up and do what he did, then maybe everyone can. Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.\\"<br /><br />-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens
B000660UN0|5.0|Having listened to Clapton for more than 30 years, I can see how he had matured in his interpretation of blues and particularly Robert Johnson's music.<br /><br />I enjoyed on this CD and DVD Clapton's arrangements of his songs and surprised in the variety that Johnson built into his music.<br /><br />Clapton keeps the songs true to the original yet adds life of his own to them and brings them out of the 30's into our era.<br /><br />I appreciate too, him keeping the original lyrics, especially on Sweet Home Chicago and Johnson's peculiar geographic connection.<br /><br />The more I have seen Clapton in the last few years, I think he has really come to be comfortable in his music and playing to a legendary level. This is a very good set to own.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|This review is for people considering the seemingly steep $45 price tag--since I know that loyal Waits fans will pay any price.  All three discs are worth the price of a normal disc, since each has 16 or 20 songs.  This isn't a greatest hits album or updated old tunes but a collection of new songs that span what has to be the widest variety of musical genres that one artist has dared put into one release.<br /><br />Tom Waits gets classified into \\"Folk\\" by many music services, but this appellation must equate to a musical wild card, the \\"thing\\" in a noun's \\"person, place, or thing\\" that covers everything you can't nail down as standard.  Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan are probably the only qualified personnel who can set these gems into a particular category-- [...].  I would create a new genre called \\"Carnival Gothic\\" or \\"Barroom Classical,\\" but they would still fall short.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that each song takes you on a journey outside of your daily routine.  That walk may cross into melancholy territory, but you emerge changed, and that's what great art does.  In these 56 songs you will be introduced to characters who are desperate, nostalgic, and endearing--they tell the story of the old man in the corner of the bar, the crazy lady in the desert antique store, and the vagrant ex-con in the back of the boxcar--stories self-preservation and sanity kept you from hearing.  It stands alone as an incredible addition to his vast 30+ year opus that I hope will continue to grow.  Each of these three discs will be played as often as my other single Tom Waits albums.  I'm so happy to have three hours of new Tom Waits to listen to you'd think it was Christmas Morning.<br /><br />Well if you were on the fence about purchasing this album, hopefully I snuck up and pushed you off.
044024157X|3.0|I agree with many of the comments that indicat ethis is a relatively good book, even if it varies greatly from previous Grisham novels oin terms of pace, plots, etc.  What bothers me is the book cover sells it as another Grisham novel.  Mostly it sells the murder, his statement to the jury, that he has been released and there is revenge.  I purchased the book based on wanting an action novel.   Weeks later, it is nothing more than a well-written account of a newspaper editor making commentaries on coming of age in the south.  Nothing wrong with it, but don't bait-and-switch the reader as to thinking it is a \\"typical\\" Grisham novel

B000JK8OYU|4.0|If you're a purist, you'll have no trouble finding a reason not to like this.  On the other hand, the team of George and Giles Martin have managed the interesting if unnecessary feat of creating an audio movie of sorts, by condensing a selection of Fab Four recordings into an artfully overlapping cycle of song-parts.  I can see this taking off as a trend, and being duplicated with diminishing efectiveness using the catalogs of other artists, but in this case, the tampering has been executed with respect and love for the source material.  Well worth a listen.
0307346609|5.0|Honestly, I read Zombie Survival Guide with the intention of it being humerous. The book wasn't all that funny and in fact, it was more serious than anything else. I read halfway through the book and put it down. <br /> <br />When I heard World War Z was coming out, I immediately jumped on it. I love apocalyptic stories and this sounded great. As soon as I read the first couple of pages I knew I would love it. I read it in two days in between classes. It was incredibly well thought out but way too short. The quality in which Max Brooks writes is phenomenal. His descriptions of all these different locations is just as great. First he will talk about some obscure city with such great detail that even locals would be impressed and then he woudl describe some small village in the eastern world with just as much fluency.  <br /> <br />More than anything, this book opened my eyes. Yes, it opened my eyes to the incoming zombie invasion as well but I feel it really prepared me for a new style of writing. The social commentary was very subtle and it wasn't until I looked at the Wiki page of the book to realize what I had missed. There is one part in particular that I just couldn't stop laughing at: an interviewie said he watched one of the War Z films that showed  several survivors fending off a zombie envasion in the fog. He said it wasn't just the fog that scared him but it was this scary music. Max Brooks uses his incredibly useful footnotes (used to correct some of the interviewies mistakes as well as provide necessary insight) to state the scary music was an instrumental version of \\"How Soon is Now\\" by the Smiths. I thought that was great. <br /> <br />I feel I am ready to go back to Zombie Survival Guide to not only appreciate Mr. Brook's writing but to prepare myself. <br /> <br />Thank you Max Brooks.
0790742780|4.0|It's simple to see how this sort of thing can happen.  I see it every single day, with people at my company attempting to run the SAP accounting system.  They all, like D-FENS, have fermented in their minds to a state that can most charitably be described as boiling rage, and any one of them could erupt at any second.
B000000H66|5.0|First off, this is an album littered with marked contrasts. It is extremely melodic and engaging, yet relentlessly heavy and brutal. It is punctuated with Chuck's screaming, deranged and highly idiosyncratic vocal style, yet possesses many moments of rare and extreme beauty, like the ending to the final track, or the lilting acoustic guitar that appears at the end of 'Crystal Mountain'. The songs are for the most part highly concise and markedly well composed, trimmed of any excess and delivered to perfection, and as such manage to be accessible and enjoyable even on a first listen, despite the striking fact that each is technical and intricate to an extreme degree: the music is defined by numerous time changes, shrieking, schizophrenic riffs which interlock and contrast with each other, subtle rhythmic shifts, powerful dynamics, ultra-complex, groove infused drumming, and striking, endearing chorus sections.<br /><br />The wealth of contrasts, however, does little to detract from the undoubted enjoyable nature of _Symbolic_. It is actually an album which is ruthlessly innovative and highly daring, fusing brutal, technical death metal with more progressive aspects, a tightened melodic sensibility and songwriting which I believe has never been bettered in the genre. Witness the stellar, breathtaking riff which opens the title track, the oh-so welcome release of tension which propels the ingenious chorus of 'Empty Words', the delicious interplay between bass and drums which underpins the intro to 'Sacred Serenity' (and lays bare the fundamental dynamics which drive the music under all the spectacular guitar playing), the epic, unpredictable twists of 'Perennial Quest', not to mention the blistering, space age thrash exemplified by the melodic '1000 Eyes' or 'Without Judgement'.<br /><br />The intelligence in the compositions is mirrored by the intriguing nature of the lyrics-highly cryptic as always, but by now light years away from blood and gore death metal fodder. Chuck seems to tackle images, manipulation, discovery and perception, and each is covered well, providing a base which allows these cerebral and intricate pieces to flourish. The level of sophistication and abstraction is high, no doubt, but the spine-tingling, kinetic nature of the songs keeps everything exciting: this is heavy, brutal music of neck snapping intensity which is primal, engaging and fulfilling, all at once.<br /><br />A remarkable and important statement from this landmark band, the sheer power and lack of compromise which exemplified Chuck Schulinder's work cannot be overlooked. It stands right at the pinnacle of metal albums as a whole, and the fact the Chuck would go on to push boundaries right to breaking point with _The Sound of Perseverance_ is genuinely frightening. I am thankful that he created this truly exceptional musical legacy and shared it with us all before he left us.ck seems to tackle images, manipulation, discovery and perception, and each is covered well, providing a base which allows these cerebral and intricate pieces to flourish.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|The creators of South Park are over the edge with this one.  Think of South Park with no boundaries.  I laughed so hard my stomach literally hurt.<br /><br />However, if you do not like or get South Park humor, you will not like this movie.  If you do, it's a MUST SEE!!!<br /><br />Make sure to see the bonus material - also very funny and informative.
0131103628|5.0|If the original syntax of C was both pith and precise, then the spirit of the text follows the spirit of the language perfectly.  It is remarkably short, provides a clear sense of not only how to program well and how to structure large tasks intelligently but also a very intelligent presentation of how the computer executes the generated code and what is actually going on under the hood.  This last aspect is sufficiently lost in 4G languages and elaborate frameworks and tools that the critical art of debugging has become a crass exertise and \\"tweak and test\\" that lacks a deep appreciation for why some things weren't a good idea to start with.   <br /> <br />No mater what language you program in, please read K&R.  It will be one of the few programming books you will still own ten years later (my current copy was bought in 1981).
B000AGTPUK|3.0|As a book, the Polar Express is a modern Christmas classic.  I was both ecstactic and sceptical to hear it would be turned into a feature film.  Picture books don't tend to translate well to feature length films (See Jumanji, Cat in the Hat, the Grinch).  Yet the team behind this guaranteed that care would be given to the treatment of the material. <br /> <br />Care is given to the material.  The world of the film is true to the world of the book.  Attention is given to little things such as being able to see the wolves from the train.  The theme is that of innocence, and if you're looking for a film that encapsulates innocence, look no further.  Zemekis and crew do a fantastic job of illustrating the innocence of children at Chrismastime.  This film has a lot of spirit going for it.  And by far, it is the most innocent, 100% kid friendly movie I've seen in recent memory. <br /> <br />The filmmakers take some liberties.  Notably in adding some conflict, such as difficulties in reaching the North Pole, creating some side characters, and adding more depth to the North Pole that is featured ever so briefly in the book.  The best addition is easily the homeless man who appears only to the Hero boy on top of the train.  The worst has to be some awkward decisions about the North Pole.  Sorry, but the ultra futuristic look and Santa's rainbow whip kinda turned me off. <br /> <br />Then there is the design.  This movie looks specatacular - in 3D.  And if you see this in Imax 3D, it is a breathtaking experience.  However, on DVD the 3D experience is not there to reveal the film's many shortcomings.  For one, \\"oohs\\" and \\"ahs\\" of the 3D experience are replaced with the filmmakers attempts to stretch the story into a 100 minute feature.  Furthermore, the supposedly groundbreaking \\"acting\\" in the film makes the people's movements seem awkward.  While the actual character designs are fine (though I would probably reconsider some of the facial expressions in the film), the movements do not allow you to suspend yourself in disbelief.  The final blow is the film's music.  The score is fine, which seems to recall Silversti's own Back to the Future, while also recalling another winter based score, Danny Elfman's score to Edward Scissorhands.  Sadly, the same can't be said for the film's songs, which lack the immediacy and poignancy of Disney's animated features. <br /> <br />Overall, the Polar Express is a great family film that fares better on the big screen than on the small one.  On the small screen, the story moves slowly and the visuals don't come to life nearly as well as they do on the huge Imax screen.  Zemekis and all involved capture the innocence of the book perfectly, but can't stretch the theme of the story to keep us sustained for 100 minutes.  Catch it at the Imax in 3D or read the book.  As a stand alone film at home, it may be a snoozer.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|Interesting, and worth viewing...but not as good as the Lester version released in theatres.
0061150142|4.0|This is a book that I would recommend. While there were things that I wish the author would have elaborated on more and not let hanging, all in all, this book was worth reading. Even if it ends up not being a favorite of yours, don't stop yourself from reading more of Jodi Picoults work. This the 3rd book I've read of hers and I've not been disappointed yet.
B000A88F22|5.0|I just bought the DVD after watching a few of the episodes on TV.  I'm a huge Britney fan and after reading the reviews of the show I wanted it just the same.  I mean come on people, it's a compilation of home movies.  I look back at my home movies and I talk funny, make funny faces, do silly things and just goof off on them...just like the DVD provides.  It's simple and it gives a glimpse into Britney's life.  That's all I wanted from it.  I think it's funny and comical.  Now, as a celebrity I wouldn't have put it out for everyone to see, but give her a break.  People were jumping down her throat about Kevin...she just wanted everyone to see that they were real with eachother.  I got that!!!
B000I5X81A|5.0|How often do you buy a CD based solely on the artist(s) without ever hearing a song from it, then being totally blown away by every song? Honestly, there is not one single tune of the 14 that I don't like. Even the remake of \\"Anyway the Wind Blows\\" (from J.J.'s \\"Okie\\"album) has some very pleasant guitar licks which actually add to the enjoyment of the original. I actually find myself smiling with delight during ALL of the guitar solos. Many of  J.J.'s songs make me feel like I'm floating gently down a calm river. This entire album is easy on the ears. I agree with the reviewer who said this CD should be the Album of the Year. Get it, you won't regret it.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Richard Donner's cut is almost a superior version to an already great film. Not everything fits together though. I mean if Superman turnt back time again in this version then how come the bully at the resturant recognizes him at the end. They probabably should've kept that scene out. This version cuts out scenes that made the original version more solid though. I mean this version makes it look like Superman freed Zod at the end of Superman 1 by throwing Luther's missle into space. So  the scene in Superman 2 where Superman saves Lois from terrorists stealing a missle is cut out of this version.<br /><br />  Also in this version Lois starts to suspect Clark is Superman right from the start of the movie. One part that works the most is when she drawers glasses and a hat on Superman's picture in the newspaper to see if he looks like Clark. Scenes that don't work is how she's sort of a crazy woman in this version. Okay jumping in wild rapids to see if Clark would save her was crazy in the original version. But here she jumps out the Daily Planent window just to see if Clark would turn into Superman and save her. She even shoots Clark to see if he is Superman. So yeah she's a bit of a mad woman lol.<br /><br />  Christopher Reeves having scenes with Marlon Brando are nice in this version too. Since Marlon Brando isn't in the original version of Superman 2. In this version it's Jor-el (Brando) that Lex Luther talks to and not Superman's mom like the original version. It's nice seeing scenes with Brando that were never seen since he was so good in the first Superman. The relationship between him and his son Superman is built up more here and it's pretty solid. If all that was in Superman 2 from the start it would've went from a 4 star movie to a 5 star movie. But a lot of the effects are unfinished and make it look like an old science fiction movie from the 50's. I mean they can look cheesey. Still it can be interesting and fun to watch this version if you grew up with the original version. Even if it is a little sloppy and doesn't work 100%.e original version. Even if it is a little sloppy and doesn't work 100%.
B000GI3KHQ|1.0|Yes, you are correct. The video quality of this DVD you own is atrocious. That is because you have been DUPED. That is because it is a BOOTLEG. I have been tracking the progress of a potential DVD release of this movie since the time I bought my very first DVD player. Unfortunately for the general public, back in June of 2002, the rights to this masterpiece fell into the hands of Allied Artists Entertainment. (See my scathing review of those clowns below). They came up with the ingenious idea to release this classic on a low quality, dying format (VHS). But my patience has finally paid off, as Warner Brothers will be releasing a full length, unedited, restored, anamorphic widescreen version on DVD in March of 2007. Well, folks, I'm very sorry you fell for this one but don't feel bad as this was a well orchestrated scam. Hey look, even Amazon.com fell for it! I believe this junk was first made available on a seedy website called MoviesUnlimited. I guess Amazon wanted a piece of the action and took the bait. As a reputable online store (it's where I shop), Amazon should immediately pull this from their site. But c'mon folks, what were ya thinkin when it arrived in the mail...the cover art's scanned from the VHS box, the disc itself has no label on it, the recorded side is Purple, and the disc contains no menus or chapter stops. Did ya think it might have been good idea to return it immediately??? But fear not. In just four months all of us Billy Budd fans can finally rejoice together.  Take care.
B000J103PC|5.0|I read the book, which was so fantastic that I couldn't put it down and was done in 3 days so I couldn't wait until the movie came out. While the movie is different from the book, it is still pretty good. Andrea is from a small town and is a family girl who has never experienced the corporate world and especially the self-important people who go along with it.  She quickly learns to speak only when spoken to and to make her job her life if she wants to get anywhere.  She does it so profoundly that all the girls who made fun of her in the beginning are envying her in the end.  I loved the movie mostly because I can relate to Andrea because I too had the boss from hell...it was pretty scary how in certain parts her boss reminded me of mine to the T! There are tons of funny parts and in the end she makes a good decision (which I won't spoil!). Meryl Streep plays the boss very well and Anne Hathoway plays Andrea perfectly. <br /> <br />I absolutely LOVE her clothes in it!  If only my job had those perks ;o)
B000GFLKF8|5.0|Spike Lee has made a Hollywood movie and it's one of the best movies this year and certainly the best in at least a decade for the heist genre. The performances are top notch, the direction is superb and the pacing is explosive. Not to be missed.
B000FA57RG|1.0|The reason being that only Madonna's hardcore fans are interested in a pretentious documentary praising the \\"new and improved\\" Madonna. I can't imagine what an inflated ego Madonna must have to think this thing would have ever received theatrical distribution. She simply regurgitates the same nonsense she has being talking about in interviews since the Ray Of Light era. If you aren't a hard core Madonna fan this will only put you to sleep. It's a shame that the Reinvention Tour was shoved into the background for this drivel.

0618680004|1.0|As a prominent atheist Dawkins sounds more like a muck raking politician calling names than a scientist putting forth a proposition.<br /><br />I know many unpublished atheists that make make better and more sound arguments. Listen to this whine, bearing in mind that I too have reservations with intelligent design.<br /><br />\\"It is precisely the fact that ID has no evidence of its own, but thrives like weeds in gaps left by scientific knowledge, that sits uneasily with science's need to identify and proclaim the very same gaps as a prelude to researching them.\\"<br /><br />I will do a word substitution and make the exact same points from the other side.  I could have done the whole page. In fact these same points can be made in just about any argument. There is no logic, just the underlying assumption he is right and therefore everyone else is ignorant.<br /><br />The following rewrite makes just as much sense as his argument:<br /><br />*It is precisely the fact that atheism has no evidence of its own, but thrives like weeds in gaps left by Christian theology, that sits uneasily with a Christian's need to identify and proclaim the very same gaps as a prelude to searching scripture and praying about them.*<br /><br />I must admit I did not finish the book; I also turn don't listen to political convention speeches. Richard Dawkins flames are not a rational argument.  One star is too high a rating.<br /><br />Dawkins will win no converts to his doctrine, just thunderous applause from those already in agreement and wanting to join him in feeling superior.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is preaching, and selling books, to the choir.
6305511055|5.0|If you're looking for a thriller, don't delay. Click this movie home to you as fast as possible. This film is a genre maker and covers every level of what I love about thrillers. Best of all it's a thriller set against political intrigue. It is very fast paced, especialy considering it's over 30 years old. Once it grabs you, it never lets go and it is considerably re-watchable. <br /> <br />Redford does well as the \\"why me\\" hero and Dunaway can certainly work the role of damsel in distress like few others, but Von Sydow is wonderfully cold and creepy and steals most of his scenes, and as usual Pollack directs all of the chaos beautifully. <br /> <br />DVD Picture: 4 out of 5.  Sound: 4 out of 5 <br />
0380713802|5.0|This is one of my favorite humor/travel books.  There are several sections that make me laugh out loud for pages, something not that many books can do. Over the space of a year, I've re-read it twice, and it remains as good and bright as ever.  I've gone on to buy all Mr. Bryson's books, and have enjoed them all, but for me this is one of his very best.
0446615625|2.0|I've enjoyed the author's work in the past.  However, in this book he can't help but preach his politics through his characters endless ramblings.  I don't even care that he has a leftist streak, but it was waaaaay too much.  Stick to the story, David.
B000J103N4|4.0|At the time of this review I have not heard the CD. I have however listened to the DVD disc.I played the stereo portion first and was quite impressed with the sound.Spacious,clean, a lot of depth to the music and realistic sound especially the acoustic guitars. When I played the 5:1 segment of the DVD I found the sound to have almost no bass or depth.My machine plays only Dolby Digital and not DTS, and perhaps this is why it sounded like it did.Perhaps it is because of my system the 5:1 sound is not as impressive.Nevertheless, I would recommend this CD/DVD for the enhanced remixed Stereo version.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|One of the greatest mystery films of the last decade. Chock full of so much suspense, it can be easily mistaken for a thriller. <br /> <br />As far as the Blu-ray edition goes, 5 out 5 stars for picture and sound. The skin tones are well rendered and the blacks almost never clip. The sound is house shaking without an ounce of distortion. The picture is sharper then I remember even from the theatrical presentation. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|As a longtime Austen enthusiast I looked forward to this film.  But at least in my view it is not at all true to her wonderful novel.  The best of the dialog is lifted from the book, but the actors deliver it at a flat, hasty manner.  The rest of the dialog is anachronistic and stupid, with too many panderings to 21st century conceptions of romance.  The pauperization of the Bennett parents was completely unnecessary to point out the particular situation of their daughters. A few comments about the entail would have been sufficient.  In addition, the parents (the most amusing characters in the novel) are totally miscast in this film. <br /> <br />I made the mistake of buying the DVD.  I would suggest that Austen fans try before they buy.
B00012FXAE|3.0|i saw the first movie upon its release and didnt like it. accordingly until now, i have stayed away from any of its sequels (what are there, about 19 now?) well, i kinda enjoyed this, but as with its progenitor, i found nothing exciting or innovative or tense. just a decent run-of-the-mill monster in confined quarters movie, and not in any way the equal of \\"the thing\\" (either the howard hawks or john carpenter versions). sigourney looks good tho. <br />
0060763280|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. <br />It helped to focus my energy, and opened my eyes to some of the issues that have not taken me as high as I want to go with my online business. <br /> <br /> \\"Rich people focus on opportunities/ Poor people focus on obstacles\\" <br /> <br />This line is key. <br />There are no obstacles. Truly, this is important. <br /> <br />Quit complaining that the wall in front of you is too high and start looking for a ladder! Or, as this book points out ... walk around the wall. Even if its a few miles long. <br /> <br />Great read. <br /> <br />- Steve
B000HC2LI0|5.0|In the age of reality television, The West Wing was my saving grace for many years. It is surprisingly re-watchable whether you like to jump around to your favorite episodes or watch it again start to finish. After every disc I play I'm ready for another. \\"What's next?\\" as Jed Bartlet would say.    On 45 discs , you just couldn't ask for a better box. The set is well organized, easy to access, and surprisingly small. Any specific episode takes only seconds to find and the extras are great. The pilot script really sums up the quality of the series. If you're a fan and haven't bought a lot of the other seasons already, then this is the way to go.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|It is simply amazing that a group of blokes who are approaching their 50's can still play metal like Iron Maiden does...<br /><br />This is really a return to form that we have only had glimpses of since 1988's 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' and I myself enjoy their latest effort better! Great progressive guitar work, intelligent lyrics, classic maiden 'gallops' to rock out to, and  Bruce's voice sounds better than ever.<br /><br />Although this album may remind you of Iron Maiden's glory days in the 80's, it is by no means an attempt to recreate any of the old sounds from past releases. My favorite song on the album is 'For the Greater Good of God' - at over 9 minutes there is never a boring moment, taking the listener from a softer story telling mood to moments of mind-blowing triple-guitar pieces and huge vocals comparable to such on classics like 'Hallowed Be Thy Name'.<br /><br />Many of the songs on AMOLAD see the band experimenting with their brand of 'storytelling rock', thus creating an epic feel to the sound, and resulting in over half of the 10 songs exceeding 7 minutes in length. Only one of the songs on the album is under the 5 minute mark. You really get your money's worth from this album! Oh, the melodies of Maiden! Beautiful...<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you enjoy this album be sure to check out Megadeth's last release 'The System Has Failed' - it is also a definite return to form for another hugely influential metal band!
B00004TJKI|3.0|my overwelming memory of having just watched this is just how damned looooooong this movie is. a courtroom drama that extends to nearly three hours better be taut as seltzer, and this just lollygags way too much. while james stewart is usually one of my favorite actors, he is permitted way too much hemming & hawing here by the always pedestrian director otto preminger. strong support from youngsters ben gazzara and lee remick, and a fine duke ellington score (tho it seems to get lost half-way thru). worth watching, but it wouldve been alot better with 20 minutes slashed. <br />
0307346609|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. And the book really lends itself to sequels and fan fiction. Loved every minute of reading it.  I'm even re-reading my favorite chapters.  Finally, something to quench my thirst for zombie material besides yet another viewing of Land of the Dead.

It's also available as an audiobook - if your mate won't read it, maybe listening will work.   <br /> <br />I am a voracious reader and regret not finding this book years ago - I think it would have changed my life.

B000JJRIN4|4.0|First off, if you're expecting music as featured on her first solo album 'Love, Angel, Music, Baby', you may be dissapointed. In a short amount of time, Stefani manages to switch up her game by going from pop to a more R&B/hard/rough sound. There are a few pop songs on here, such as 'The Sweet Escape' that reminds me a bit of Madonna's 'True Blue' in its retro sound and the sort of pop ballad 'Wonderful Life'. Other than that, Gwen goes for songs that actually sound as if they could be covered by No Doubt.<br /><br />The best song on the album in my opinion is the Nelle Hopper penned-track '4 in the Morning'.  A nice pop/r&b groove love ballad that will have you hooked and singing along by the second chorus. Also, another fan favorite seems to be 'Early Winter' which is surprisingly another ballad that reminds me of No Doubt's 'Simple Kind of Life.'<br /><br />Gwen also has some rather pop/rap-ish songs where she really delivers some tongue-twisting lyrics that she's known for now. 'Breaking Up' may lead you to believe its a ballad about lost love but instead it's a rap about trying to get a message through to someone while dealing with the call being dropped on the cell phone. 'Don't Get It Twisted' plays on the circus music theme but gets into another rap. Heavy on the Neptune's beats and unique sounds are 'Wind it Up' which samples a song from the musical \\"The Sound of Music\\" and the rather original song 'Yummy.' A rather fun R&B/Hip-Hop song 'Orange County Girl' also sets the tone of this album being very different from her first solo effort.<br /><br />Now, for the weakness. It sounds like some of these songs are more B-Side-ish than they are new, fresh, album-ready material. 'U Started It' and 'Flourescent' are okay, but forgettable tracks that get lost in the fold. While 'Wonderful Life' is interesting, it also gets lost when stacked up against the other pop ballads and experimental tracks. While her first solo effort seemed to be consistent and well thought out, at first listen, this just seems weak and rushed in comparison. Yeah, the songs are still good but there are definitely more tracks on this that are skip-worthy than on her first CD. Also, she does best (solo wise) when she's doing pop songs rather than when she's trying to be a Hip-Hop/R&B artist. 12 tracks seems to be a little weak as well ... for those fans who've been following the album development, there's no 'Candyland' on the album at all. It's not even being offered up as a bonus track at retailers; those seem to be live versions of 'Wind it Up' rather than a totally new track.<br /><br />In all, still, it's worth buying and better music than what's considered popular by U.S. standards.hought out, at first listen, this just seems weak and rushed in comparison.

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which, judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one, was very much a fact. <br />Still, this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip, there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.  <br />I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity, the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however, this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which, in no exageration, has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?
B00003CX8U|4.0|while i dont usually enjoy self-indulgence in an artist, i cant deny that this works very well. bob fosse chronicles his own mental and physical collapse from a few years earlier while simultaneously directing \\"lenny\\" on film and \\"chicago\\" on stage. this is a nightmare movie, in no way pleasant to watch but fascinating nonetheless. strong performances from roy scheider (as fosse), leland palmer (as gwen verdon), and ann reinking (as ann reinking). and btw, take a look at what won the oscar as best movie that year when this (and \\"apocalypse now\\", \\"breaking away\\", \\"being there\\" and other worthies finished out of the money!) <br />
B000J3FC0Q|5.0|Uk songstress Amy Winehouse's brilliant 2003 debut `Frank' earned her lots of critical acclaim, and even won the Ivor Novello award (for songwriting), but largely flew under the radar commercially, with its retro soul/jazz sound (that Christina Aguilera is using now), her raw and raspy vocal delivery (mature beyond her young years), and very frank lyrics.<br /><br />She returns on `Back to black', her sophomore disc, which is off to a blazing start in the UK; Top 10 for the album, and lead off single, the horn sprinkled midtempo Motown-ish `Rehab', a song about a battle to get her into rehab, fictitious or autobiographical, we don't know.<br /><br />The horn sprinkled `You know I'm no good' has a jazzy/tango sound set to skittery hip hop beats. Very catchy and one of my favourites. `Me and Mr Jones' is a downtempo retro soul/jazz/blues song that sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s. There's a slight reggae feel to `Just friends'.<br /><br />The title track `Back to black' is a beautiful midtempo Motown-ish song with excellent harmonies, and haunting/creepy sound effects. `Love is a losing game' is a lovely ballad, and continuing the Motown influence, the beautiful `Tears dry on their own' has traces of `Aint no mountain high enough'. Awesome song and another of my favourites.<br /><br />`Wake up alone' is a tender ballad with soothing harmonies, the brief `Unholy war' is a mellow blues/jazzy song, `He can hold her' is more upbeat with a hip hop beat and horns flitting in and out. Closing is the sunny, upbeat, Motown-ish `Addictions'. Retro sounding and beautiful.<br /><br />This is a stunning album, and definitely one of the very best released all year!!!
0321334876|5.0|The author proposes different ways(good and bad ways) of coding or solving a problem( design problem) and presents the best practise and explains beautifully why it is a best practice. His explanations are entertaining and like a mystery novel gripping, you won't put it down untill finished. <br /> <br />Programming experience in C++ is assumed but a novice too can appreciate his book. My suggestion is, if you are a novice, read and grasp the concepts and syntax using Books like Stanley Lipmann's C++ primer, then jump to this book. <br /> <br />This book is indispensible for a C++ interview, make it a point to read this book before an interview. Various concepts of C++ are dealt with like const pointers, when to go for template class design and when to go for a inheritance class design, what is an interface, when one should use virtual destructors and when not to ( not many books say why not to ), operator overloading, the list goes on and on... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IU3XU6|5.0|While it is true that this recording (Awake) represents some new directions and selections from Josh Groban, I contend that you really have to get the \\"big picture\\" or the full spectrum of Josh's recordings and performing career in order to fully appreciate his musical repertoire. Once again, we owe much of his success as a vocalist, performer and producer of CD recordings to the guidance of his mentor, David Foster. I think that if Josh had never hooked-up with Foster, his career would not have sky-rocketed as quickly, but we can only theorize on that possibility. The fact remains that Josh's instructor at Interlochen (The National Music Camp in Ann Arbor, Michigan), knew David Foster and forwarded Josh's tape to him to listen to... \\"the rest is history,\\" as they say, and David knew right away that Josh was to be a sudden vocal sensation. David Foster's arrangements have contributed to many solo artists in a similar fashion including Barbra Streisand (the Broadway Album series), Lara Fabian (who also did his recording, Broken Vow), Natalie Cole on \\"My Grownup Christmas List\\" from The David Foster Christmas CD, and most recently, Andrea Bocelli (Under The Desert Sky concert and DVD+CD) as David's interest is to bring Bocelli into the American popular music venue, a slight departure from his classical and Italian popular works.<br /><br />I disagree that this recording (Awake) is the \\"definitive\\" Josh Groban CD recording of his career to date, but rather would say that it would be worthwhile to have all of his recordings and DVDs to really get the total picture (which I do, by the way). I first heard a selection of Josh Groban from his first CD while browsing at a book store, I immediately went back into the CD music section to find out who was singing and purchased the Josh Groban CD. When I asked around, it seemed that no one had ever heard of him, yet! But, within a short time, his follow-up CD+DVD package, Josh Groban In Concert was the recording from his PBS Special concert which finally brought him into the limelight, not to forget his duet with Charlotte Church on The Prayer and Somewhere on her Enchantment DVD (her concert in her hometown of Cardiff, Wales), his duets with Lara and Barbra, his vocal on Remember Me (from the movie soundtrack Troy) and his track of Mi Mancherai (also in the movie: Lady in the Water and Il Postino) from his album Closer, and other collaborations with Lucia Micarelli (on violin) and the musical group, The Corrs. Invariably, the American audience would latch onto his English recordings more readily than those in Italian, (which is exactly the same reason why David Foster convinced Bocelli to address the same venue of popular American music).<br /><br />Awake represents more of a musical departure, and self-direction and production from Josh (including his vocals and drumming on a few tracks), but I would strongly suggest that one should just get all of his recordings to really fully appreciate his talent and direction. I'm just hoping that this is not just another rise to fame, too fast, and then crash and burn (by comparison to Russell Watson who came out with a few CDs and one DVD concert. But Russell didn't have David Foster producing him... Josh did!).<br /><br />In light of Josh's total musicianship, I also think he should explore some cover work as he is also quite gifted as a keyboardist, drummer, etc. I believe he could do a better job at the Great American Sougbook than, let's say, Rod Stewart who really doesn't have the right voice for slow standards. Josh does.  And since his concert ticket prices are quite high, I would rather spend my money on his recorded media to enjoy over and over again, rather than seeing him live one time.<br /><br />In summation, anything Josh does gets my vote of 5 Stars!!!pecial concert which finally brought him into the limelight, not to forget his duet with Charlotte Church on The Prayer and Somewhere on her Enchantment DVD (her concert in her hometown of Cardiff, Wales), his duets with Lara and Barbra, his vocal on Remember Me (from the movie soundtrack Troy) and his track of Mi Mancherai (also in the movie: Lady in the Water and Il Postino) from his album Closer, and other collaborations with Lucia Micarelli (on violin) and the musical group, The Corrs.

B00007GZR5|2.0|robin williams was carving out a strong career for himself. then came movies like this: mush about being a family man. i guess he still hasnt gotten over the guilt pangs about dumping his wife and running off with the governess, because he keeps making this movie over & over again. cool special effects tho, it might be fun to watch on acid. <br /> <br />
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I was a huge fan of the original S2 and was excited to find this version. The quality surpasses in this version versus the Lester version.  The theme was a bit darker and more mature while maintaining its entertainment.  The return of the music of John Williams elevated the film.  Definately worth the purchasing.  One word \\"quality\\".
0689853637|5.0|I have several of Sabuda's wonderful Pop-Up books and each are exceptional in their own way.The only way to describe these books is by using words like,magical,romantic,fantastic,mythical,whimiscal,imaginary,curious,intricate,elegant and similar words that convey the imagination and skill Sabuda uses to conceive scenes then make them pop-up in a book as the pages are turned to unfold them.<br /><br />  Being winter scenes, he uses a lot of white, and covers it with glitter to give the effect of new-fallen snow on a cold winter's day.He also makes use of silver papers combined with colors to create magical scenes.<br /><br /> On first opening the book, we are startled by a Snowy Owl that seems to fly right off the page;and with the simple opening of a flap we find a family of mice greeting the day.Next we find a pair of foxes ,in their white winter coats sitting in their den ,and on the same page,with a simple flip appears a rabbit, also in his winter garb.Then a wonderful scene of a Polar bear and fish in glittering,ice cold water. Then we are treated to a scene of leaping bears and playful squirrels;followed by an elegant moose and a pair of beavers.And for a grand finale we have a wonderful,colorful forest,complete with animals ,snowman and friendly little house,and with the pull of a tab,the festive spirit comes alive with 12 flashing colored light.<br /><br /> The only thing,to me at least,that is more intriguing in how these scenes are designed;would be what the scene in the printing shop must be like where these books are printed and assembled.<br /><br /> On other Pop-Up books,I have commented on the fragile hinges these books have; and how prone to cracking and spliting they are. It seems that this problem has beed recognized and in this book a cloth spline and hinges have been incorporated;a positive improvement.
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|finally available on dvd, i managed to watch this movie on veterans day, november 11th! gary cooper turns in one of his strongest acting jobs as a simple and honest man who is forced into war tho he is a pacifist, and emerges as one of the great individual military heroes of all time. and from all accounts, it actually happened that way! excellent supporting work all the way around, and the movie manages to be fair to various points of view: a far cry from what one might expect. <br />
B000002H97|5.0|This is the dark masterpiece that Metallica fans have been clamoring for for years. Inside this wall of noise is a fragile soul being knocked around and battered. I pity those too narrowminded to experience this hardcore triumph. Its depth and complexity come from the evil genius of the Mettalica boys and they don't let up on your soul even as you call for mercy. They say No quarter asked, NO quarter given.<br /><br />This is what it must sound like in a demon's stomach when he's just eaten the souls of a small Viking town. For those about to buy this and rock! I salute you!
B000BVEKO0|4.0|I liked this album, I mean it took me twice to enjoy it...but I really liked it. With their first album without Head, they pull it of with the songs like Twisted Transistor, Politics, Love Song, and Coming Undone. Those are just to name the best on the album. All in all, if you like Korn, buy this cd. It is an album to have in your collection!! <br /> <br />Also, give limpbizkit's: Unquestionable Truth pt. 1 a chance, it took me two times of listening to enjoy it as well but after listening, I really like that ep now.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I love Loreena.  I have all of her CDs even the holiday releases.  I love all of them.  Unfortunately after several listens I have to say this one is a bit of a disappointment.  It starts off strong; the first 3 tracks are quite good.  Unfortunately the remainder of the album is not too interesting.  It sounds too reminiscent of previous work in many spots.  Also it's pretty one dimensional and very mellow.  Granted she's predominantly done ballads and slower songs throught her career, but on this record, it seems a bit much.  I'd give 3.5 stars but it gets 4 because she's Loreena.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|Wow! John Cusack shows his incredible range again. In this movie, he plays a white man in his late 30s with dark hair. Much like he has in his other roles over the last few years.<br /><br />In this film he's kind of a tall, silly, post-collegiate, sensitive, sort of awkward guy with a heart of gold and a lighthearted remark always on the tip of his tongue. Nothing at all like the other films he's been in.<br /><br />Frankly, his toupee does not bother me as it did some other reviewers. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I thought his toupee's performance was at least as strong as his.<br /><br />Branching out is Cusack's trademark and this film is no different. So, if you like Cusack as a loveable mensch who can;t seem to find his way through life until he finds or reconnects with the right woman, you'll like this and almost every other one of his films.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|yeah, you wont be mad if you buy it. this movie is one of those where if you see it you would be glad you saw it, and be happy its in your collection.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|I am sooo dissapointed that the song \\"Love is Gone\\" is not on the widescreen version.  I have loved that song since I was a kid.  I know it is on the full screen, extended version but I don't understand why they couldn't have made both widescreen and full screen the same version of the movie.  The extended one is so much better.<br /><br />With that being said it is still one of my favortie Christmas movies ever and I will continue to watch it year round just like I did with the video version :-)

B0000009SY|5.0|I have been a Zappa fan since I snuck a listen to Apostrophe/Over-nite Sensation from my Dad's collection 20 years ago.  Like much of Zappa's music, this album, perhaps his finest overall work, can be oversimplified and categorized ascetically (as a previous reviewer attempted to do). <br /> <br />This is not just \\"silly and crude humor music\\" and it does not fall into a \\"1,2,3,4 category\\" of Zappa listener.  Joe's Garage, as a complete work, attacks and obliterates those individuals/organizations who, through various means of censorship, insidiously undermine the purpose of creating music. <br /> <br />He accomplishes this with direct attacks on the political right (e.g. the Central Scrutinizer), conservative religious parties (e.g. Catholic Girls), the media and all other pseudo-intellectuals (e.g. packed goose), and, really, anyone whose sensibilities would lead them to censorship of creativity.  Consider the historical context here: the attack on music throughout the 1980's/Tipper Gore's The Parents Music Resource Center was founded in 1985.  The content of Joe's Garage is intended to offend all these people. <br /> <br />Like all art, one can make a judgment of whether the overall piece appeals to their ascetics, which Joe's Garage does for me - definitely five stars, and leave it at that.  However, true analysis of real art should leave one with questions on intent, message, and composition which Joe's Garage also does very effectively.   <br /> <br />Through this analysis, one can realize one object of Frank Zappa's argument: freedom of expression (in this case music) is important and socially relevant; hence the aforementioned party's desire for censorship.  Beautiful use of irony through music Frank! <br /> <br />\\"Eventually it was discovered that God did not want us to be all the same. This was bad news for the Governments of the World... Mankind must be made more uniformly if THE FUTURE was going to work out... It was about this time that someone came upwith the idea of TOTAL CRIMINALIZATION, based on the principle that if we were ALL crooks we could at least be uniform to some degree in the eyes of the law. Shrewdly our legislators calculated that most people were too lazy to perform a REAL CRIME. So new laws were manufactured making it possible for anyone to violate them at any time of the day or night... which is one of the reasons why music was eventually made ILLEGAL.\\"  <br />--Frank Zappa, liner notes from Joe's Garage, Acts 2

B000002UVX|5.0|Music is like Art,there's no explanation,either you like it,or not.I think it's the sentiment of the artist and the sentiment of the one who hears it.The piece 'Machine Gun' entertained during the concert in the Isle of Wight to me is my best Experience.It's not only the famous of the artist,but it's also a human spirit.In this volume,'Power of Love' is that fantastic that my cd is damaged, I rewinded many times.Band of Gypsys gives breath to Hendrix's music.Hendrix plays his guitar with his soul.<br />The sound of his guitar is the first of a kind that has brought electric guitar sound into new era.And it's evergreen.It's loved and enjoyed by the youth of today too.It's not only in the Band of Gypsys,in any band,Hendrix can light up and give power to the entertainment.
B000I0QK74|1.0|I don't know who ever let this guy sing Christmas songs, but they need a good beating. His voice and style are totally wrong for Christmas songs.

B000H0FEVI|5.0|This is a wonderful and highly original novel about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation that raised his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year. This is definitely a book well worth reading.

Who ever the video editor is, he needs to be slapped for doing such a bad job for a big band. All the flashing images, scrolling lyrics, b&w low res background video, color whirling, screen-splitting make me feel like I'm watching some videos made by some idiotic noob on youtube. Once again, whoever the video editor is, he needs to be fired. <br />- Where is 5.1 sound? Where is DTS? o_O Come on people, this is Dream Theater, not the Beatles in the '70, give the audience some good sound. Whoever the sound editor is, this idiot should be slapped and fired with the video editor. <br />- Fullscreen video. What? Full screen video?? You gotta be kidding me, it's fullscreen! Grrrr... <br /> <br />All right, that's quite enough for the bad's, now here's the good's <br />- Hair!

B0008KLW6S|4.0|This is a wonderfully nuanced fantasy flick with a bravura performance by Dennis Quaid who plays the father and a compelling one by Jim Caviezel who plays the son.<br /><br />Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he claimed this film to be reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode. It certainly has that feel to it. The premise here is a simple one. A son, haunted by the premature, though heroic, death of his fire fighter father thirty years earlier, is reunited with him through an old ham radio which had belonged to his father. He finds himself speaking to his father over the air waves, when an aurora borealis-like solar storm provides a conduit into the past.<br /><br />This connection to the past allows the son to alter the one event which has so profoundly marred his life, that of his father's death. Over the airwaves he tells his father of the fire to which he will be dispatched and of his impending death. He also tells his father what he needs to do in order to avoid his premature demise. The father is dispatched to the fire about which his son has told him and acts upon his son's suggestion, forever altering the future.<br /><br />This change, however, alters other events, and it results in his mother's premature death at the hands of a serial killer. Father and son now go to work in tandem, each in his own time and way, to try to alter this event, forever changing their respective lives. The son, who is a cop, finds that the case which he has been working on is now the unsolved serial killer case involving his mother.<br /><br />As the father effects subtle changes in his respective reality, this causes shifts in his son's present day reality. While this may seem a little confusing, it is to be expected when you are dealing with time shifts and the ramificatins of altering past events through future information. Ultimately, this causes an interesting convergence of the past upon the present.<br /><br />A nice touch to this film is the fact that it takes place in Queens, New York, home of the New York Mets, and both father and son are die hard Mets fans. More specifically, the father's death occurs in 1969, the year in which the New York Mets won the World Series. This will turn out to be a pivotal event in the movie for more reasons than the obvious one. Baseball fans and nostalgia buffs will love its inclusion in the film.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie which is sure to both fascinate and tug at your heart strings.place in Queens, New York, home of the New York Mets, and both father and son are die hard Mets fans.

B00004YYWI|4.0|Though Orchid is (in fact) one of the best albums to ever grace my stereo i had to knock one star for its sheer lack of production. There are alot of choppy bits in songs that seem rather disorganized and take away from the flow of the album as a whole. For instance, the transition between Requiem (an acoustic instrumental) and the Apostle In Triumph is an extremelly shoddy act of production. One that was openly admitted as a mistake but still never fixed for the reissues. Even though this is Opeth's first album I would highly recommend listening to Still Life or Morningrise first.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I love this album!! Gwen is a very vocally talented muiscal icon! She brings back more of her very vocally talented voice with bass bumping beats and ballads that we love. Even though this album is different from the first, it brings back the hottest blonde we all know and love with more chart topping hits on this album that truly is a sweet escape! It couldn't be any sweeter!! So go and buy it if you love great music or are a BIG fan of Gwen Stefani, like I am!!
B000050IE6|5.0|Still Life is very quickly advancing to my favourite album of all time...moving in on Morningrise with every listen. This is Opeth at their peak of creative brilliance. An absolutely awe-inspiring album. Don't even read any more reviews on this cd... just go and buy it. NOW!!!!!
B000002JSJ|5.0|I'm one of those who overlooked Presence, instead wearing out the earlier records. I bought the cassette from a bud and it totally blew my mind. Although Physical Graffiti is my all time Zep fave, Presence is more straight ahead rock than anything they've ever done. It's simple, crisp and sonic all in one lump of plastic. Achilles Last Stand, For your life, Hots on for nowhere are all highlights but the boiling sonic blues of Nobody's fault but mine is just incredible. I believe it's Page's most consequential solo, it combines all the best of the blues and dirty low down rock and roll. Sweet!! Mind blowing and it sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it. It does feel rushed but it was made after Graffiti and with much turmoil surrounding the band. It's an overlooked gem and worthy of being included with all other Zep records, period. Powerful, yet simple. I love it. You will too. Give it a chance, enjoy...turn it up!!!
B000AADYYO|3.0|Accessable Opeth? I remember when listening to Opeth was obscure...when nobody knew anything about them. This band was and always will be my favourite band of all time....but who are these jokers who are just NOW being introduced to them and say things like \\"i'm not really into barking vocals but...\\" or \\"If it weren't for the some of the heavy vocals...\\" seriously, i know that every band has to grow... and up until now Opeth HAS been growing... read my reviews...I LOVE THIS BAND! so why did they feel it appropriate to include such simply open string arrangements and song tempos??? because they are trying to make money at this point...The fist time I heard The Grand Conjuration i thought... \\"this is not opeth\\" and only because it IS Opeth have I graciously gave this album 3 stars ... because i know what this band is capably of. The clean vocals are too cheesy...too often and way to catchy and commercial. The best songs on here are ... <br />The Baying Of The Hounds  <br />Atonement <br />and ...and...i guess  <br />Harlequin Forest...  <br />and they are ALL nothing compared to anything off of any of their previous released. <br />And the inclusion of keyboards is (i think) a great improvement... in their live shows as well as the overall sound of the band. <br />So ...now.. everyone can jump down my throat.
B00000294R|4.0|Harlem's own Big L was one of the most amazing non commercialized rappers in the game. He wasn't trying to be a star or a big named rapper, just a freestyle legend. And let me tell you, he can spit some shhhh off the top of his dome (if you get a chance look for an album called \\"Harlem's Greatest: A Freestyle History\\"). I first heard of this guy on the Music Choice Channel when the song \\"All Luv\\" by D.I.T.C. was being played one night. He didn't have the best verse in the song (outshinned by Lord Finesse) but he grabbed my attention.<br /><br />Listening to this album, I understood where Big L's style came from and how he elevated it. \\"Put It On\\" was a dope single and a way to start off the album. My favorite song on the entire album would have to be \\"No Endz, No Skinz\\", a song about women out for a mans money. A lot of these songs through out the album he would talk about murder (\\"All Black\\") and living the inner city life (\\"Danger Zone\\"). Lyrically he was good to the point where you would hit the rewind button a few times (\\"I wouldn't give a chick 10 cents to put cheese on a whopper\\"). But at the same time he kinda overdid it to have people like \\"what the hell?\\" (\\"If I catch AIDS, I'ma start raping b*****s\\").<br /><br />Guest appearances came in packs in two songs \\"8 Iz Enough\\" (I forgot what televison show that came from) and \\"Da Graveyard\\". In many songs there are a lot of no names at the time, with the exception of Lord Finesse on the latter song. But today you can find Killa Cam (Cam'ron) in the song \\"8 Iz Enough\\" and a younger Jay-Z in the song \\"Da Graveyard\\".<br /><br />Production wise is cool. I know Diamond D and Showbiz did a few tracks on here. So you have that D.I.T.C flavor throughout this album.<br /><br />Flaws are not that many. Some people might can't take the intensity of Big L's lyrics. But hey that was his style of rapping. And maybe \\"I Don't Understand It\\" and \\"Fed Up With The BS\\" might fall under skip material. Other than that this is one album that is a perfect album to your collection (and at the price listed, you CANNOT beat it!). It's sad he was taken away from us and hip hop due to an act of violence (the day after Valentines Day, 1999). There was reports that he was going to sign under Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella records before he was killed. I keep saying I'm going to buy \\"The Big Picture\\" but haven't gotten around to it.

B00008OLYN|4.0|I actually give this album a 4.5 rating but really wanted to give it a five. The only thing that sets me back from a 5 is the ending to Closure. I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE WAY IT JUST CUTS OFF!!! The live version on the Lamentations DVD is so much better.(and I say this being a person who absolutely loves this song) Whatever motivated Steve Wilson and the band to end it that way baffles me. It's also annoying when you want to skip to the next song (Hope Leaves) and you get a little click of what was Closure at the beginning... annoying as hell. Anyway, with all that off my chest it is by far one of the most beautifully written albums of all time. One that IS INDEED mellow but as Mikael puts it in his introduction for the song To Rid The Disease (on the Lamentations DVD). <br />\\"just because this next one is a bit mellow doesn't make it any less evil does it?\\" <br />and the answer was and is ... <br />NO
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I have read several reviews of this DVD and I have to say that I think some folks are just being WAY too picky. The thing that I told myself the first time I saw this was that what I was about to see was an 'approximation' of what Superman II would have been like had Richard Donner been allowed to finish the film 25 yeas ago. I was pleasantly surprised. While this cut is a bit rough around the edges, I found that I was emotionally invested in these characters after the first 20 minutes or so. By the time the film got to the re-powering sequence, I was totally into the film. I actually cried during that scene. Reeve and Brando really put some serious emotion into that scene. It blew me away.     I have to agree with some of the reviewers here, there are a couple of scenes that (even though they were Richard Lester footage) should have been extended in this version. Some scenes just felt cut off too soon. Like the scene after Superman rescues the little boy from Niagara Falls. There was nothing wrong with Lois stating that Clark wasn't around as usual.     There are some scenes that by necessity had to be cut short, because there was no corresponding filmed footage and the Richard Lester stuff just wouldn't have worked. For example, the use of the screen test. Because it was decided to use the screen tests for Reeve and Kidder, the Lester scene where Clark is revealed to be Superman couldn't be used. Or any part of it. Thus, the quick cut after that was unavoidable. Also, there were a few scenes between Lois and Clark after they arrived at the Fortress of Solitude (Lester footage) that could have been trimmed a little better to fit better with the Donner footage.     Over all I personally prefer this version of Superman II to the theatrical version. I wish people would get off criticizing the 'turn the world back' end of this film. What I guess folks forget is that this was the original scripted ending for Superman II, but it was moved to Superman: The Movie. An alternate end to Superman II by Donner was never filmed. According to Donner, it wasn't even discussed how they would end Superman II. That was going to wait until they got back to filming in 79. Well, as we all know, that never happened. So, what else could they have done to end this cut? It was totally impossible to bring the cast back after 25 years to film new scenes to finish the film. Nor do I think it was appropriate to use the Lester magic forgetful kiss.     I'm just glad that after 25 years we are finally seeing what Superman II could have been. I watched both versions of Superman II this past weekend and I stand by my opinion. Even if it is a little rough around the edges and the ending is the same as Superman: The Movie, this is by far a superior version of Superman II.
0780619951|1.0|..I sat down and watched this.  I couldn't believe all the critics hated it and it was rated in the top 10 worst films of that year by all of them.  Saddly, I found out that they were right.  This is amazingly bad.  I just don't know how you can go from pre-production to post and still produced vomit like this.
0375507256|5.0|'Cloud Atlas' is written by the hand of a master storyteller. Different voices, in different periods all sounding authentic without pretense. Back in time even ahead of time, the stories are all slightly interwoven to show the cyclical way our lives are all connected, even if it's as ethereal as clouds. \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\" could be published seperately and sold as a Nabakovian masterpeice. One of the funniest things I've ever read. An original and moving work.
0811729117|3.0|I acquired this book as memoirs from Tiger crews are unusual (at least in English.)  As these veterans age, and pass on, these captured memories become even more important, especially with a \\"Greatest Generation\\" mythology in the western (well, US) popular historiography.  I was looking forward some of the answers to questions I would ask Wehrmacht veterans:  what was your impression of your leadership/weapons vs your opponents?  How about logistic support?  \\"Tigers in the Mud\\" answers some, but certainly not all of these questions.  IMHO, it's more a response to the current revisionist view of the Wehrmacht in Germany today.  Yes there's data on the Tiger (and Pz38(t)) and JagdTiger, but as in any memoir, one must take this information with a grain of salt (a large in the case of the JagdTiger.)  Due to these influences, the writing is somewhat plodding.  I think other reviewers views of \\"mundane\\" hits the mark.  <br />Recommended for armor combat students, but probably not for average enthusiast/wargamer.
1582701709|3.0|The Secret is to know what you want, be thankful, and feel the emotions and passion that go with it. The universe will answer. All true and said in many other books and tapes. This book is inspirational, but extremely overdone and repetitive. This is a collection of interviews from 30 people who are listed at the back of the book. If you go to their web sites, you must register to look at their products and then will recieve emails asking for donations. How spiritual is that? There is very little practical application in this book.  The theory of the book in general is wonderful and better written about by other authors such as Wayne Dyer and Gregg Braden.
B000002VRZ|4.0|I saw the Outlaws live twice in the early eighties and had a great time at both shows.  This album is just plain fun to listen to and brings back some very fond memories.
B00005JO20|5.0|To be perfectly honest, because I had never watched the original King Kong, or any of the remakes, I went in expecting nothing but a few good action scenes, and a predictable, tacked on story at the very end.  Boy was I wrong. <br /> <br />I seriously enjoyed every moment of this film.  Well, *almost* every moment.  I have to agree with popular opinion that the first 45 minutes of the film were pretty long and unnecessary, however, we're talking about a 3 hour movie that honestly didn't disappoint after those beginning 45 minutes were over.  From that point on, the movie pretty much ruled. <br /> <br />My favorite part was the dinosaur chase.  It really DID look like the actors were being chased by those deadly dinosaurs.  The fight scenes between King Kong and the dinosaurs was another lengthy dose of nonstop excitement.  You simply couldn't ask for better action. <br /> <br />As for the story, well, that was the one thing I was worried about, seeing as how this version of King Kong is the only one I know.  I could have sworn, judging by the black and white pictures I'd seen showing King Kong swinging around from the top of a building, that the story would be entirely overblown and far-fetched.  Once again, I was wrong.  The story honestly didn't disappoint. <br /> <br />I believe this movie deserved all the attention it received about a year ago.  It really is good, and it really is believable that a giant ape is chasing a bunch of people around.  I can't believe I actually felt some emotion when King Kong became close with Naomi's character.  Oh, by the way, Naomi Watts is now the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.  The interaction between her and King Kong was totally believable and emotional, and I can't believe I'm saying that!  It really works! <br /> <br />Some people will say the movie dragged, and was overlong.  However, what really happened was that Peter Jackson gave us probably the best version of King Kong we will ever see.  I haven't seen any of the previous ones so I can't say I'm entirely sure, but there will NEVER be another remake in the future as good as this one.
0440238609|5.0|I'm a fan of Tolkein, Rowling, Lewis, Leguin et al - but this really is the 21st century heir to all of them.  It's beautifully written, creative, and addictive (try to put it down - dare you), but it's far, far darker and more complex than Harry Potter or any other of the \\"young adult\\" fantasy classics.  It's closest to Tolkein  - Pullman has obviously put a great deal of time into cosmology or theology (or however you want to see it), and it's paid off handsomely in a coherent framework that seamlessly connects the three volumes.      I know a lot of conservative Christians who don't like Pullman's work because it IS, in some ways, an indictment of organized religion.  But it's a long way from anti-Christian - anti-establishment is more like it. So don't let that put you off!  It's also a truly fabulous read, full of astonishingly beautiful images like paintings on the pages - images that burrow into your imagination and stay with you.     To be honest, I'd consider this a PG-13 trilogy - not for risque reasons (there aren't any, really) but because it's sometimes blunt, even brutal in its depictions of loss and pain.  It's harrowing at times even for a grown-up, so I don't think I'd buy it for a really young reader, precocious or not.  But if you want to inspire an SF/fantasy fan who's looking for something far better than the usual unicorn fluff, this is it.  It's just great storytelling, period.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Yes is the greatest band ever when it comes to interesting, complex and unpredictable musical chops.  You simply can't predict how one of their songs will go.  It's impossible! <br /> <br />I believe the Yes Album is where the band finally came into its own, and gave the world something that we will never be given again.  The nearly 7-minute \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" probably features some of the greatest vocal melodies and guitar playing of the bands entire career, and that's really amazing considering Yes have been on the music scene for nearly 40 years.  The moment the songs speeds up IS the greatest thing ever. <br /> <br />I have personal reasons for liking \\"Starship Trooper\\".  The instrumental part at the end reminds me of the look in everyones eyes that had died, and makes me wonder if, somewhere out there, those people are watching me on earth.  At the very end of the song when the guitar comes in, that's the stuff there, man.  That's the STUFF! <br /> <br />Yes is clearly not a band for everyone, but they're for me, and I'm happy about that.  <br /> <br />Oh, and the remastered version isn't really worth the extra money because what you get are two short versions of songs already available on the disc.  That's not a way to make me happy, let me tell you.  But one of the bonus songs is a longer version of a song already there on the regular album, so that's a good thing.
B0000041Q3|5.0|For many years, my \\"Turandot\\" of choice was the old RCA set with Nilsson, Bjorling, and Tebaldi.  Loud, brash, garish, colorful, the score is the epitome of Grand Opera, and the power of Nilsson's performances as the \\"Ice Princess\\" is still regarded by most opera fans as \\"the only one,\\" to quote Eva Marton. <br /> <br />This recording taught me that the opera is also beautiful. <br /> <br />Turandot is a fantastic change for Dame Joan, and she sings it with passion, vehemence, warmth, and exquisitely easy high notes.  The voice in the theater was indeed quite large, especially in the middle range, with a top that slimmed down to a silvery sheen above the staff.  But for this recording, you get the overall sense that Sutherland was holding something back all these years - until now.  Pavarotti is simply as great as he ever was - the voice in the theater was exactly like his recordings.  His Calaf is thrilling from beginning to end.  Caballe's Liu outshines Tebaldi by virtue of the most sublime pianissimi ever recorded: the final note of \\"Signore ascolta\\" goes on forever.  Ghiaurov and Pears are luxury casting, but the rest of the cast are no slouches either.  Even Piero de Palma, the most recorded character tenor in history, is on hand to sing Pong, a solid experienced veteran, and a real artist.  Zubin Mehta manages to integrate the brash colors of this score and refine them to glowing effect, without loss of grandeur.   <br /> <br />This recording should be placed in the hall of fame as one of the best studio performances of all time.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|This second solo album certainly snuck up on me, not as advertised as her first solo album. The song \\"wind it up\\" was fairly peculiar upon first listening, however, after many listens it does in fact grow on you. I heard a lot of negative things about this album, but because i've followed gwen for years, i gave it a shot. it is a very good album, despite what people say. \\"wind it up,\\" \\"the sweet escape,\\" \\"early winter,\\" \\"now that you got it,\\" \\"breakin' up,\\" are my favorites (majority, not bad) i believe the track \\"now that you got it\\" has the same intensity as \\"hollaback girl\\" had.  <br /> <br />Overall, this cd is definitly worth getting for the collection of any solid gwen enthusiasts out there.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Great documentary.  I just wanted to add that seeing this movie and mentioning it to other people is an important contribution that anyone can do.  Changing the course of this tragedy won't be done merely by gigantic figures in society, but by each individual who does their small part in their private lives.  So go see this movie and take the small steps towards change.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie is classic. Highly artistic. One of the most memorable moment is at the beginning of the movie, where a beautiful night scene of Los Angeles is taken using crystal clear HD cameras from atop of taxi while Bach's air on the G string playing in background. It is beautiful that luck can play such a big role in one's life. If Max hadn't noticed the knock on the window and hadn't called vincent back, his life would not have changed so dramatically. \\"Fate\\", therefore is the first theme of this movie.    What is often misunderstood is that Tom Cruise's role in this movie is not entirely villan. He is also a victim of our urban society plagued by apathy, where people are so lonely even though surrounded by so many people. \\"17 millon people, but nobody knows each other ... gets on the MTA, dies, nobody notices\\" as Vincent told Max in the beginning. His emotion is epitomized by the scene where the lone Koyote crosses the street. Needless to say, Vincent finds how little different he is from this Koyote. At this moment, a beautiful music starts playing which makes this scene another memorable moment in this movie. \\"Loneliness\\", therefore is the second theme of this movie.     If you are like me and many other people who are more or less played by fate and are aware how much of your life is out of your control, and live or have lived in a big city like LA and experienced loneliness, then you will be able to appreciate the most beautiful part of this masterpiece.     If you are not, you can still enjoy this movie by thinking along with Max (instead of Vincent) how he can escape this curious situation he has fallen into. Vincent's plan to carry out hit using a Taxi is clever because he doesn't have to rent a car (to do so he must give his ID; also he may not be as familiar with LA's complicated streets as a cab driver does; even if the rental car comes with a GPS navigation system, without an expert like Max who even knows the schedule of traffic lights, he may still be caught in a traffic jam and not being able to carry out 5 hits in one night.) He can also let the dead cab driver take the blame of his murder, as he did previously. The flipside is of course that he must control the cab driver, which he obviously enjoys because he likes the challenge and is also interesting for the audience to watch.
B00005LOUS|2.0|When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?<br /><br />I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.<br /><br />But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.<br /><br />Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?<br /><br />I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.<br /><br />by Tom Knapp, Rambles editorthe animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years.

B000FQ4M58|5.0|Yup, Mr. Loaf is back with a third installment of \\"Bat out of Hell.\\"  At first listen you think, \\"Oh, no.  This is too much.  Too tense, too loud, too emotional.\\"  The subtlety -- how can that word be applied to Meat Loaf? --and the melodies only come through with a little familiarity. <br /> <br />This guy can sing. His tenor may not be quite as tenor-y as it was 30 years ago when BOOH I became an all-time best seller. but he can stay on pitch in a full throated howl with a background of massed voices, insane keyboards, and raging guitar chords. You get the idea?   <br /> <br />My favorite songs are at the end of the CD.  \\"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be\\" is vintage Meat Loaf, cynical, dark, long, and endlessly repetitive.  Jennifer Hudson does a fine job of playing point-counterpoint with Loaf on vocals. \\"Cry to Heaven\\" is the opposite: brief, lovely, almost tender.   <br /> <br />Smallchief

B000ILYYJE|5.0|I have been seeing reviews all over the internet where people don't really care if they get the DVD-Audio discs and either don't have a dvd-audio player and/or a 5.1 set up. Believe me, you should sell some of your stuff around the house and invest in a dvd-audio/sacd system.  I got 3 players in case the high rez discs go out of fashion along with the players so I'll still be able to play my collection of high rez discs.<br /><br />  Now about the Door's boxset. Though s/t had only ambient sound out of the rears and Strange Days had about half of the cuts with surround, the rest were great.Since I never bought the last boxset of all of the Door's studio lps remastered, I'm glad I bought the set.
B000J10EQU|1.0|So, Superman sleeps with Lois and has a son out of wedlock?  Sorry to spoil it if you haven't seen it, but the bottom line is that the superhero can't control his libido and Lois is living with her fiancée while still loving her hero.  Not good role models for any of us and a huge disappointment to have Superman degraded so. <br /> <br />The acting wasn't that good, but much of that could be the fault of the director or whoever wrote the script.  Corny, corny, corny. <br /> <br />While I understand that superhero movies like Spiderman, Batman, and Superman will have some things that are obviously not real, this movie was so full of absolutely absurd situations that it was impossible to put aside the ridiculousness of them and enjoy the film.  The plane doesn't disintegrate in space and then is supported by it's nose?  The destroyed city of NY (?) is back to normal a couple hours after a huge earthquake?  There is no tsunami after a land mass the size of Los Angeles rises out of the Atlantic (maybe the producer should have watched \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\")?  I could go on.  Don't waste your money on this loser of a film. <br />
B0002J4ZWS|1.0|I didn't need to sit through 90 minutes just to see a guy going through a crap tube barfing up his guts. Oh, give that guy an Oscar. More like Shawstank Congestion.

It gets disgusting and after a while you're like I get it and why? for godsakes.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Richard Donner's take on Superman with Christopher Reeve was certainly entertaining, especially #2. The humor was always prevalent, and I will always like the first 2 of that original series. Fortunately, for the movie-going public at large, the very smart, very brilliant Bryan Singer came up with a new, darker take on the series...though a very indvidual accomplishment. The 2-disc version is quite fine, with great insights on the casting, and various other elements that went into this filmmaking endeavor. Mr. Singer is ever-present in these many extras, providing humorous and fun stuff. The film, itself, is quite fine. I saw it in a theatre before I bought this set. Brandon Routh is certainly the best looking, most handsome Superman ever on film. It's unfortunate that Mr. Singer kept him brooding and serious most of the time; that smile could melt anyone. Kate Bosworth was a terrific Lois, and I  may be the first to say the Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olson was great! Indeed, he made Clark's return seem exciting and interesting. James Marsden also was fine in what must have been a difficult role. Then there's Mr. Routh, never missing a trick, always in command. The absolute best thing about this film, in my opinion, is that there's the nastiest of Lex Luthor portrayals by Kevin Spacey, truly the way it should be. The meanness was uncompromised, and it was the most powerful performance in the film. Also, I've also been a fan of Parker Posey, especially in  Christopher Guest's improvisational films. She is very fine here, too, being the foil to Spacey's maniac tirades. I also very much liked the reference to John Williams' original score, and the love theme, \\"Can You Read My Mind\\" (which was NOT nominated for an Oscar in '78, but is one of the most remembered themes in film). With all due respect to the two Donner films, I really enjoyed Bryan Singer's addition to the Superman legacy...

That alien was cute beyond comprehension and I cried all over my popcorn and it got soggy and I threw up on the floor. And then I went out on the road with Def Leppard. ARMAGEDDON-IT!!!
B00003CX9E|4.0|Okay, I hadn't looked at the reviews for Citizen Kane before, and, well, they are about what I expected. Love and hate.  <br /> <br />No problem. This film is not for everyone.  <br /> <br />That said, I love it. It draws me in, and I think it does so because it makes me curious. I want to know more about the characters, and I am ultimately disappointed as much as the reporters are.  <br /> <br />That said, I'm not too happy with this dvd. I had the GREAT pleasure of seeing aphenominally high-quality print at the Crest theater in Sacramento 15 years ago, a print that was used to the 50th anniversary video tape. It was clear, and very detailed.  <br /> <br />This dvd is clear and detailed, but somehow just doesn't look right. It's too clean, too clear, and at times I feel that not just dust and scratches have been removed, but also details in the film. Somethings are just plain missing - raindrops disappear, and the opening newsreel seems to have been too cleaned up as well. It needs to look beat up! <br /> <br />So, four stars. Nice try, too much restoration.  <br /> <br />For those who don't like the film, don't buy it.  <br /> <br />For those who do, stop arguing, and go watch the film again. :) <br /> <br />
B00005JPCA|2.0|Am i missing something here? How is this a good Bond movie? How is this a good movie period? After loathing Pierce Brosnan's JB movies for feeling that they have been detached from the \\"essence\\" of what JB is all about, I actually miss him now. Yes, I'm one of those who believe Sean Connery delivered the best JB movies ever, followed closely by Roger Moore, but I do not cry over spilled milk either; their time has passed and that is acceptable. But this? Come on James Bond fans, you know better.   I have been watching JB movies since my adolescent years, needless to say I have watched them all. It seems the more technologically advanced -and enhanced- these movies are, the worse they turn out, for they slowly but surely take the character out of context and into showboating the strength of what the camera (and the whole crew for that matter) can produce for all of us to watch. We end up with an extremely technology-dependent movie. Before, with earlier JB movies, that was ok, because everything seemed so alien to us (yah, a rocket which devoured other rockets, or a tiny assembled helicopter destroying several real-sized ones), and that is what made Bond special in that respect. Now, what difference is any other action based movie to Bond? Simple, the catch phrases like \\"Bond... James Bond\\", or \\"Vodka Martini shaken not stirred\\".   Casino Royale felt like a long advertising ad; Sony Vaio laptops, Sony cybershot cameras, and Sony Ericcson cell phones. This was truly repugnant. It's even worse than its recent predecessors in that respect. Isn't Casino Royale the first of the Bond series by Ian Fleming? Why is it so present-based then (taking place within the confines of social/technological advancements)? I could not help but laugh when they mentioned \\"9/11\\". Why would they ever bring that up in Bond movie?   The movie felt like a series of detached events, linked only by one thing; the money everyone was seemingly after. And in between: an endless scene of a poker game. Well poker is very common in JB movies, appearing in a lot of them, but they never passed the 5 minute mark. This one made up a farily large portion of the entire movie. Well, I am sorry, if i want to watch some poker, I'll go watch Rounders (with Matt Damon and Edward Norton).   The screenplay was terrible, and the ending was definitely fantastically abysmal. I could go on and on about all the nitty bitty idiosyncracies avid and paying-attention-to-detail audiences are bound to pick up on (especially those very familiar with the Bond franchise), but i would rather end this bitter - very bitter- review with what a friend of mine had next to his nickname on msn once they announced Daniel Craig as the new Bond: \\"Blond... James Blond\\".

However, I'm told that the new policy was introduced 3 months ago Sept 2006, and yet the peak potentials web site and this one still have a graphic declaring that you get 2 free tickets to the seminar.   <br /> <br />If it said, \\"two free tickets with the purchase of our $97 package\\" I would not have written this review.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|i'm gonna make this short.  this album is really good.  a lot of people who were into s.c.i.e.n.c.e already jumped ship so thats not even a counterpoint any more.  what i will say is that they trimmed some of the fat from their last album.  this record is very refreshing.  similar tone to the previous effort, mostly due to mike einziger sticking to fender guitars since '03, but again really lean songwriting that gets right to the point.  the highs are extremely high and the lows are still good.  incubus' most organic record yet.  i say buy it.
B00005JNS0|3.0|Sure `Cars' is beautifully animated but it lacks so much to me, especially with all of the hype and praise this film has garnered.  It just didn't make me laugh.  Sure, there are some funny lines littered throughout the film, but as far as consistent humor it was sorely lacking.  The story from the beginning didn't really grab me, but with the right touch it could have eventually.  Larry the Cable Guy was by far the best thing to happen to this cartoon, but even he couldn't make me love it.  I will never be caught saying I wasn't impressed by it's beauty, I mean, I may not like the movie but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't impressed in some ways, but I may also never be caught watching this movie again since aside from the animation there was nothing much to hold my attention.

B00003CX9S|5.0|The tragic true story of John Merrick is the basis for this moving and touching film starring John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.  Shot in black & white, `The Elephant Man' never loses a single strand of authenticity or emotional weight in its production but continues to strike a chord with the viewer with every watch.  What's so important about films like this one is that it exposes the hypocrisy and audacity of most people today, the complete disregard for the welfare of others and that fear of anything we don't understand. <br /> <br />John Merrick (John Hurt) was born with a horrifically disfiguring disease that made him a social outcast.  When he was found by Doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) John was being paraded about by circus sideshow entertainer Bytes (Freddie Jones), living as a freak to society, as an animal for other peoples amusement.   John lived his entire life up to that point as an unwanted and unloved creature, not as a human being.  His feelings, his interests and the mere fact that he was an intelligent member of society went completely ignored by everyone around him.  That was until he was taken in by the hospital Treves worked for. <br /> <br />Although at first a bit reluctant, the majority of the staff at the hospital begin to take to John, and for the first time in his life he has people noticing more than just his face.  But along with the good comes some more of the bad as some of the staff still decide to profit off of John's misfortunes, tormenting him night after night.  What's so incredibly disheartening is the truth this film makes very clear.  Towards the end of the film I found myself crying, not because of the horrible way he was treated but because of the kindness bestowed upon him.  It made me realize that I was crying because that kindness is such a rarity these days and that is a sad realization. <br /> <br />With solid performances by the entire cast, most notably John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, but also by Anne Bancroft who plays a famed theater actress by the name of Mrs. Kendall who takes a liking to John as well as Hannah Gordon who plays Anne, Frederick's wife.  Her acceptance of John is both heartwarming and heartbreaking.  This is surly a film that should not be missed, a film that should be on everyone's list of most important and inspirational films of all time.  If we could all just learn to accept those around us for who they are on the inside, then, just then maybe...but even that doesn't look promising.
0393061434|5.0|I loved this book.<br /><br />I ejoy reading about the days when personal computers were just getting off the ground and this book takes you right there. It's a surprisingly easy read (although there are some far-too-in-depth detours such as Woz's painful account of how he get a floppy drive working on the Apple II).<br /><br />iWoz is funny and informative - I had no idea Woz was the first guy to put a monitor (TV, anyway) on a small computer.<br /><br />BTW, if you like this sort of book, I would also recommend \\"Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution\\" by Steven Levy (ISBN: 0141000511).
B0007Y08QA|3.0|It's a shame to me that this film didn't turn out any better.  Christian Bale's performance alone deserves a better all around film.  As Trevor Reznik, Bale delivers a knock out performance as a man at the end of his rope.  Having not slept in over a year Trevor has lost extreme amounts of weight, his weight now down to nearly 120lbs.  Not only is his weight shedding but his mind is fleeting him as well.  He's seeing things, believing things, being haunted by things that may or may not even exist and Christian portrays this perfectly.   <br /> <br />The problems (in the film) start to spring up with the introduction of Ivan (John Sharian), a man who claims to work at the factory in which Trevor works himself, yet no one else appears to know him.  It's not just the inclusion of such a character but the overall horrific acting on the part of John Sharian that ruins this film immensely.  It's the breed of overacting that makes an adult-film look like `Brokeback Mountain'.   <br /> <br />Trevor's life rapidly derails and falls apart from every angle, from his doomed relationship with call-girl Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh in a very convincing performance) to his flittering romance with Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), a young single mother who works in the diner he frequently visits.  His weight continues to drop and his paranoia continues to grow until he's convinced that everyone is trying to destroy him.  Watch this for Bale's performance and his performance alone, for while it promises a surprise ending it comes off more of a \\"oh, figured they pull that trick\\" and less of a \\"wow, never saw that coming.\\"

B000002HMH|4.0|I didn't grow up with Metallica so I guess I had the benefit of not being shocked by such a different sound compared to their older stuff.  I slowly collected all their albums a few years ago, and I think too many di-hards come down on this album, along with reload.  Load is a great album, and while its  a pretty a big transition from the past, it's still Metallica at heart.  Wasted My Hate, King Nothing, and Bleeding Me are my favorites.   Lots of bands just regurgitate the same music with every new album...god forbid they try something new.
630445841X|4.0|This is an achingly intense and visually stunning movie that has been one of my favorites for years.  The role of Tristan was MADE for Pitt, and Aidan Quinn stands out yet again as the wonderful, versatile, underrated actor he is. Julia Ormond is beautiful and refined in her role as the love interest of all THREE brothers and is painfully convincing as she descends into insanity. Isabel Two is not given much of a speaking role, but I found her to be one of my favorite characters and the actresses that played her as both a child and a woman were lovely. Anthony Hopkins is...well...Anthony Hopkins. He is perfect as the idealistic, knarly old patriarch and his obvious favortism of his middle son explains a lot of what motivates the OTHER two.  <br />As an earlier poster mentioned, the timeline in this movie was a little confusing, and there were a few editing oversights (Brad's hair kept changing in the SAME SCENE), but none of it took away from the breathtaking cinematography and some stellar acting.   I thought the voice-over of the Indian chief was very effective and helped create the 'atmosphere' of the movie. The soundtrack is rich, haunting, and agonizingly beautiful.  The music alone practically hypnotized me. Legends of the Fall is a brutal, beautiful, dark journey into madness that will leave you breathless and emotionally exhausted at the end, but I found it definitely worth the ride.

055358202X|3.0|In 1997-98, George R.R. Martin delivered a tremendous tale that shook up the fantasy genre, A Game of Thrones.  The next year, he followed that with the political machinations and pyrotechnics of A Clash of Kings.  In 2000, he killed off over a half-dozen important characters in A Storm of Swords -- one of the best fantasy novels ever.  At that point, with The Wheel of Time faltering through books 8 and 9, Martin had gained the crown of \\"The American Tolkien\\" as a Time review later dubbed him.  But Martin was barely 1/2 finished with his omnibus. <br /> <br />A year passed, no new volume.  Then another, and another, and another.  <br /> <br />Martin indicated on his website that he wanted to pick up the story years after A Storm of Swords, after the dust had settled from the cataclysmic events in that volume.  He couldn't -- there was too much to account for.  Then he reconfigured the book several times, went through rewrites and finally had to make a deal that would enable him to keep his tremendous fan following somewhat happy.  Thus, only in 2005 did Martin, with his publisher's consent, finally deliver a semi-complete book.   <br /> <br />This is book 4 in the now 7-books-and-growing series A Song of Ice and Fire.  What began as a masterpiece of modern fantasy takes a huge step back in this volume.  The first sign that Robert Jordan had lost control over A Wheel of Time came in book 7 when he added more ancillary plots to a super-saturated story.  The first sign that Martin may have lost control over A Song of Fire and Ice is the fact that it took him five years to produce the half-volume that Bantam published. <br /> <br />Martin's literary technique is to stitch together various story fragments into a full novel chapter-by-chapter by following a different viewpoint character.  In Feast, Martin wrote the tale of about 50% of the viewpoint characters, and left the remainder for A Dance with Dragons -- the next book.  So Feast is incomplete. <br /> <br />It is also in need of more editing.  Martin spends entirely too much time on the petty machinations of Queen Cersei, adds two new storylines (one of which went basically nowhere, the other has potential to be very important), writes a dull day-by-day travelogue for one character, and winds up with too few important developments in nearly 700 pages (hardcover) of text. <br /> <br />Martin still writes well, spends time on characterization, describes his world in great detail.  But there's not enough substance here.  And there's too much story left out. <br /> <br />As of the date of this review, Martin still has not finished book 5.  He does not write swiftly; he does not write when he's not home; there is no credible timetable for the series.  Books 1-3 were masterful.  Book 4 indicates Martin is in the midst of losing his touch.  I hope he regains it soon.
B00065GX64|5.0|This film is easily in the Top 5 of Fritz Lang's best films, and quite possibly his #1 best sound film as well.  In addition to being Lang's debut sound film, it was also Germany's very first sound film, and really goes to show the benefits of having waited a little while to move away from silents and into sound pictures.  Almost every sound film from the late Twenties and very early Thirties suffers from a static camera and almost nonstop chatter, as though film-making just went backwards in time by about 30 years and reverted back to being filmed stage plays instead of true \\"motion pictures.\\"  But by 1931, a number of those wrinkles had been ironed out, and what resulted is an absolute masterpiece.  And unlike a number of directors working in those very early years of sound, Lang struck a very good balance between dialogue scenes and scenes of relative silence.  He knew that the actors didn't have to be talking nonstop for it to be a good film worth watching.  Of course, the director is only one part of the film's genius; the actors are brilliant too, in particular Peter Lorre, who truly gave the performance of his career even though it was his first starring role.  The film also really sets the stage for the later film noir genre, what with the terrific shadows, lighting, and suspenseful mood and atmosphere.<br /><br />The film does start out a little slowly, but before long it gets more and more intense and compelling.  The plot needs time to be established and for the viewer to be fully drawn into it.  Lang did suspense and crime thrillers so well, and this film is no exception.  A child murderer is on the loose, and with no answers in sight, the townspeople become paranoid and bloodthirsty, particularly when it comes to those whom they already know are criminals.  The people in the underworld suffer the most from all of these paranoid accusations, and so resent how their community is suffering that they resolve to not only find the murderer themselves, but to do it all without any help from the police, who in turn have no idea what these criminals are up to.  Even criminals have standards; it's often said that child rapists and murderers are reviled by \\"ordinary\\" criminals because that goes far beyond the pale of the things they did.  When the criminals finally track down Hans Beckert, the murderer, at a warehouse, they tie up the night watchmen so they won't alert the police, so insistent are they on capturing him by themselves, even as they race to find him and get everyone back out before the police might get there.  The final section of the film, in the criminals' kangaroo court, is one of the most powerful scenes ever set to film.<br /><br />One starts out feeling repugnance at this menace, this person who molests and kills children, but by the time the film is up, one can't help but feel sorry for him, or at least see him as a human being.  We never see him hurting children, and don't even see his face right away.  He's not shown as a monster or an evil person; indeed, who would ever suspect that such a baby-faced rotund man would be a child molester or murderer?  The treatment of him is surprisingly progressive for the era.  While what he's done isn't being excused or apologised for, he's ultimately shown to be a victim himself, a very sick man haunted by this monster inside of him, doing these horrible horrible things because of it, only finding peace when he's committing these criminal acts.  Is he any worse than these career criminals who have chosen to live this lifestyle, people who could have become bank tellers, teachers, or doctors, people who had a choice because they didn't have this monster constantly following them?  This must have been a positively revolutionary idea in 1931, when many people blamed people like Beckert instead of considering that there might be medical or scientific reasons for it, when criminals were given no sympathy and viewed as unreformable menaces to society instead of human beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control.  It's the kind of film that stays with one long after viewing it, and only gets better with multiple viewings.<br /><br />Extras include audio commentary, an interview with Fritz Lang a year before his death (once again he tells the  tall tale of his meeting with Goebbels and how he left Germany late at night with barely any money, never to return until after WWII, even though his passport and other historical evidence paint a quite different picture!), the mini-documentary 'A Physical History of M,' a gallery of pictures, stills, and drawings, an interview with Harold Nebenzal (son of producer Seymour Nebenzal), a ten-minute version of 'M' made by Claude Chabrol, and excerpts from discussions editor Paul Falkenberg had with students in his film class as they watched the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must-see for anyone interested in film history; one can't claim to be a true student of classic film and never have seen it.  This film also seems to enjoy the distinction of being one of those films that just about everyone agrees is a classic and a terrific film, instead of one of those films that people are divided on about if it's great or if it's just overrated.beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control.

B000J10ERO|4.0|Good bonus features with this DVD.  Some of the behind-the-scenes footage dates back to the time before director Bryan Singer was even attached to the project.<br /><br />Routh is wonderfully understated as Supes/Clark.  He brings a quiet grace to the role.  Reeves' performance was very comic-bookish by comparison.<br /><br />Singer tosses in some references to his favorite films in \\"SR\\".  I betcha a nickel that Singer is a fan of \\"Capricorn One\\" -- there is one element in \\"SR\\" that is too similar to a scene in \\"C1\\" to be coincidental.  Even his production company is called \\"Bad Hat Harry\\", a phrase from a line in \\"Jaws\\", a movie he confesses to loving (as many many many of us do).<br /><br />Actually, as much as I enjoy actor Kevin Spacey, I thought his performance was rather unremarkable.  Competent, sure, but not particularly thrilling.  At least he didn't go too far the other way and take it too far over-the-top.  That would have been worse.<br /><br />I also bet ya that even though Noel Neill played the dying widow Gertrude in the film, her dialogue was dubbed over by Margot Kidder.  Betcha a nickel on that too.
B00065VTU4|5.0|461 OCEAN BOULEVARD an album that was originally released in 1974 revamped the career of Eric Clapton after a few years hiatus, an interlude from a fatal heroin addiction recovery, and the year when Patti Boyd finally left George Harrison for his best buddy Clapton - who in respect to the album with ALLMAN BROS. BAND producer Tom Dowd decided to start from scratch resulting to an album that repolished Clapton's career within the foregrounds of Rock history, laying down his rep as a guitar virtuoso against the decision for centering more on songcrafting panache - the album is one that had become the favourite of many (including mine) and one of the most sought after LP's, that fortunately enough - for those who hadn't scored the album on the CD format - would find a great treat for this DELUXE Edition release (along with TEARS FOR FEARS' Songs From The Big Chair, and GIN BLOSSOMS undisputed classic New Miserable Experience).    Featuring as bonus tracks on the first disc which follows the `461...' album are the sessions for what might have been the initial landscape for what would become supposedly of the record, which are covers and little sessions of the blues based kind - that might come as some quite fine pieces somehow at certain respects, but are yet formidably levelling on the sub-par passé kind, and on what could be ultimately boring - and I guess Clapton might agree in that regard as outlined in the booklet provided along with the sleeve fold-out container of the two discs, with extra pictures, and the full length album cover that pictures a fine fx rendition of a double-shot of Clapton on both ends of the picture where he sits playing the guitar, while on the other side which serves as the formal front cover - Clapton stands by the peculiarly gaunted tree, as shot on the famed mansion (for which the album title's culled from of its address) at Beverly Hills, that was owned by certain celebrities way back from the so-called big-bang era of the \\"roaring\\" nineteen-twenties and was actually alleged to be as haunted by spooks - peculiarly the veranda window in the middle of its foreground (that the bush which originally had the `RSO' records logo where it was originally released, where on this edition being solely issued by PolyGram was deleted), where in the album cover, if one would look closely, on its left upper corner a certain cross shaped spark manifested that considerably could may well be referred to as a mere reflection of the sun, but it was actually believed to be a specimen of sorts for spirit photography by some. Clapton himself owned the mansion at the time - and among those that owned the house is the famed comedian Charlie Chaplin, whose song \\"Smile\\" (a track where Clapton goofed on a line) is also included with the second disc, that features the final pair of legs from the 1974 tour of the album, which then also included the backup vocalist Marcy Levy who've become regular to Clapton's line-up, succeeding Yvonne Eliman, who've come around fresh from the movie rendition of JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR where she stars as Mary Magdalene - to serve as the back-up vocalist for the line-up in the album, that kind of paved the way for STING's concept of coming up an assemblage of particular sessionists to consist his first solo project that's been filmed as BRING ON THE NIGHT (issued as a two-disc + DVD package). Her take on singing the monumental track \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" by the Clapton/Steve Winwood act BLIND FATE - nearly seems to come as a Déjà vu of sorts for relieving the theme \\"Could We Start Again Please\\" from the said Rock Opera where Elliman sang, and another notable turn from the supplementary live disc (culled from the 1974's last two shows of December 4 and 5), is the outro for the track \\"Badge\\" - where it segued to the intro of \\"Motherless Children\\". Elliman also co-wrote a track \\"Get Ready\\" with Clapton - who in turn only have a pair of tracks written for the album himself (Clapton's classic \\"Let It Grow\\" and \\"Give Me Strength\\"), amidst a bunch of covers and tracks written by those of another. And come to think of it - the album is best listened at by the following track sequence: 1. Motherless Children; 3. Willy And The Hand Jive; 5. I Shot The Sheriff; 6. I Can't Hold Back; 7. Please Be With Me; 2. Give Me Stregth; 4. Get Ready; 8. Let It Grow; 9. Steady Rolling Man; 10. Mainline Florida  - that kind of gives the album a stance which could stand for a storyline = there goes Willy who's mother'd just died is wanted for murdering the sheriff, and is in deep trouble (tracks 6, 7, 2), in cahoots for being a heartbreaker (track 4), but is full of idealistically hopeful uncertainty amidst the storms of life, and yet was such a steady rolling man around mainline Florida.    The album embodies to represent a work where Clapton's music still holds a great impact that truly captures the listeners interest and it was back in the days where he could really come up with worthwhile songs, which he may have still accomplished to flash time and time again later on with his career that unfortunately bogged down ultimately - 461 bOCEAN BOULEVARD stands supreme among the many accomplished solo albums ever released.     RATE: 9 out of 10

Whether you own the previous release or not, this is certainly the version you need to own. Unfortunately, the \\"original\\" uncut version of the film is not included, as the MPAA forced numerous heavy cuts in order for The Passion to be released with a \\"mere\\" R rating (as opposed to a dreaded NC-17).

B0000009RT|5.0|In many cases, when an artist puts out a great debut album (or film, book, TV programme), it is quite often a pain in the butt, as they have an enormously difficult time coming up with something greater.  Orson Welles's Citizen Kane is considered the greatest film of all time by many critics, how do you top that?  Welles was never really able to.  Zappa did.  Freak Out is an amazing album, yet, Zappa was able to constantly do work that was even better than this album, one of the greatest debuts in rock history.  Zappa made interesting and artistic work up until his death (which is the day I'm writing this review).  This is one of my favorites, especially the last track, the originally side long song The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet.  The producer, Tom Wilson, was on acid when Zappa recorded it, so God only knows what the hell transpired in his mind that night.  The social commentary on here is still valid, and this is one of the greatest debuts of all time.  Zappa never disappointed....
B000IJ79WU|2.0|SPOILER: I was aghast with outrage to see the first movie's most outrageously crappy plot element--Superman turning back time by temporarily reversing the Earth's orbital spin--mindlessly transplanted to the sequel. This trick was stupid enough to almost eradicate the many great virtues of the original movie: it doesn't make sense from a sci-fi POV on physics, it was a cheap cop-out to get the screenwriters out of a box they'd unnecessarily written themselves into by killing Lois, and it did absolutely nothing for the development of the characters. The last thing I expected to see was this idiocy repeated in II. It's astonishingly unimaginative, it makes Clark's revenge on the mook in the diner seem all the more pointless and petty, and it doesn't in any sense explain why Lois suddenly loses her developing train of thought on the many red flags pointing to a link between Clark and Superman. Also, seeing Supes kicked into Liberty's torch was nice spectacle, but Superman is NOT set in New York City--it's set in Metropolis. This DVD will NOT be finding a home in my collection.

It's an almost completely different film, and it sucks! <br /> <br />After watching this dud, I concluded two things; Warner Brothers clearly had good reason to bring in director Richard Lester as a replacement AND that there should be a statute of limitations for revising a film that has already been in long and good standing with movie audiences. <br /> <br />Two major problems under Donner's direction.  One, the overall story seems far less gripping as it almost completely undercuts the special bond that develops between Superman and Lois.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|Plagued with production problems since the director from the previous two X-Men chapters, Bryan Singer, said goodbye, X-Men: The Last Stand proves to be no less problematic upon its theatrical release. Hired gun Brett Ratner tries to appease fans of Singer's work while adding a plethora of geekout moments for fan-boys to eat up. The plan backfires, however, as for every one of these moments that The Last Stand gets right, it gets at least two or three things wrong in character development, plot, and overall appeal. To start with, some major cast members are killed off, and surprisingly early on, too. This would be enough to anger fans of the comics and films alike but to make things worse, just about everyone in this movie acts out of character--Wolverine becoming the team leader and Professor Xavier turning into a control freak are but a couple examples. It also doesn't help that all the main story arches that have been developed so painstakingly by Singer are mostly ignored or completely dissolved here in favor of a few flashier and far shallower characters. Though the opening scene with Angel as a child is particularly moving, his character doesn't do anything of importance for the rest of the movie. The same could be said of countless others whose sole purpose is to look cool and provide a quick fight scene or one-liner. There are so many things wrong with X-Men: The Last Stand that to put them into a list would take days to complete. The only thing that can be said for it is that Brett Ratner is able to rely on the screenwriters to add in enough action-packed effects shots to keep people off the trail of just how much is lacking here. A summer popcorn flick at best, X-Men: The Last Stand strips the series of everything that made it enduring and original and replaces it with enough tongue-in-cheek humor and whizbang effects to keep casual audiences coming back for more.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I was first hesitate to watch this film, in respect to Christopher Reeves. But this movie was much better than I thought. I loved how they stayed true to the previous style of the other Supermnan films. Used same music, intro style of the cast and costume of Superman, just a different color red for his costume.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was great as Lax Luther. He does a good bad guy, experience from his role in Seven.<br /><br />Great special effects, cast, story and directing. I loved, and guessed, the part of Louis' Lanes son. You will guess to not after long in the film. I 100% recommend watching this movie. It kept my attention every second.<br /><br />I think this film was just as good, if not better, than Spiderman and Batman Begins.<br /><br />Nicole M*
B00005JNS0|4.0|The seventh film from the incredible collaboration between Disney and Pixar, Cars is probably the most mixed and formulaic movie of the bunch. That's not to say the movie isn't good. The premise, a world populated with anthropomorphic cars &agrave; la every single Disney movie ever, is admittedly prosaic but Lasseter and co. know how to milk that formula like nobody else. Cars serves as further proof of this as the film has got it where it really counts. Though the characters and the coming-of-age tale are about as traditional as it gets, Pixar again picks the perfect talents to breathe life into their CG creations. Everyone is appropriately charismatic, tough, melancholy, or goofy with Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy leading the way. Visually, Cars is absolutely stunning, topping all of Pixar's previous efforts. Sometimes the gorgeous vistas are almost too good; one can easily find themself admiring the scenery instead of paying attention to the story but the quick pace manages to reel the film's audience back in quickly enough. The only quality of Cars that is worthy of being deemed \\"bad\\" is the soundtrack; no matter how hand-in-hand country and Nascar go, bad music is still bad music (which would have been easily fixed if only Randy Newman sang the tunes). While not as revolutionary as Toy Story, heart-warming as Finding Nemo, or brilliant as The Incredibles, Cars manages to generate enough smiles and heart-felt moments to allow it a place on the shelf next to the rest of the Disney/Pixar gems.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Stefani hit gold and platinum with Love.Angel.Music.Baby, which was a charming confection of retro-pop with a splash of modern clubbing. The biggest hit however was 'Hollaback Girl', a Neptunes-produced, hip-hop inspired jam. <br />Apparently Stefani thought it would be prudent to put out another album basically full of 'Hollaback Girls'. What a mistake. 'The Sweet Escape' is an almost endless nightmare of misplaced hip hop and Stefani posturing like a rapper. What made \\"LAMB\\" so charming is totally absent on an album full of derivitive beats and 'featuring' rappers. Stefani is not a rapper nor should she pretend to be one; she only comes off as incredibly commercial, fake and ultimately a huge let down as this album sounds exactly like all other Top 40 music in 2006, instead of being different and quirky like her previous album.  <br /> <br />So much for being the next Madonna. What a shame, what a disappointment Stefani turned out to be.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|..because I liked the song \\"rabbits are roadkill\\" I believe.    Anyway, upon first listen the word \\"[...]\\" came to mind.  Fast Forward 2 weeks and it's the only CD I've been listening to.  It has a bit of everything, I can't imagine if you picked up this CD for any reason, you wouldn't LOVE at least 2 songs and listen to them over and over and over and over.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I got this album the day it came out and was amazed at how awesome they are. The band really evolved itself. Ray Toro's guitar riffs and solos are incredible,Gerard's singing got better (although he was good when he SCREAMED his lyrics, he shows he really can sing). Frank's guitars also are awesome and Bob's drumming is incredible  I was able to really notice some influences of Green Day's American Idiot,(which is my favorite band; MCR is second) Queen and Pink Floyd. This is my songreview: <br />  The End. - Awesome Song. They really put a simple song like this and made it rock 5/5 <br />  Dead! - Definetly one of my favorite songs on the album. The sing along at the end rocks and the solos are incredible 6/5 <br />  This is How I Dissappear - Its alright, the chorus is good 4/5 <br />  The Sharpest Lives - For some reason reminds me alot of their song      To The End 3/5 <br />  Welcome to the Black Parade - The first single. If you haven't heard it yet its incredible. Very anthemic 5/5 <br />  I Don't Love You- When i hear it i think of Dashboard Confessionals and Angels and Airwaves. Really good song 5/5 <br />  House of Wolves- Sounds like Green Day's \\"Hitchin' A Ride\\". Both good songs. 4/5 <br />  Cancer- Good song. Piano actually sounds good for this emo band. It's sad and shows the grimness of knowing you dont have much time left  5/5 <br />  Sleep - Incredible. One of my favorites. Heavy, heavy guitars and good vocals. 5/5 <br />  Teenagers - A really good sing a long. I cracked up the first time i heard it. \\"Teenagers scare the living s--t out of me\\" One of my favorites on the albunm.   6/5 <br />   Disenchanted- Another one of my favorites. Starts of acoustic but soon gets rockin'. I've had it stuck in my head for days and pretty happy i can't get it out. It's lyrics, \\"You're just a sad song with nothing to say about a life long wait for a hospital stay\\" are really mind opening  6/5 <br />    Famous Last Words- Great way to end an album. The guitar riffsare really great. The words are pretty much the same throughout the song so another good sing along on the album. 5/5 <br />    Lastly... Blood! - about 40 seconds... a hidden track like the song after A Day in the Life by The Beatles and F.O.D. by Green Day. It's pretty funny. 4/5 <br />Overall the album is amazing and really shows a turning point in MCR's career. <br />
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I WAS KINDA SCARED ABOUT PURCHASING THIS CD, BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST CD's I HAVE PURCHASED THIS YEAR.  CORRINE BAILEY RAE SOUNDS LIKE NO ONE ON THE MUSIC SCENE RIGHT NOW, AND THATS WONDERFUL.  MY FAVORITE SONG IS \\"TILL IT HAPPENS TO YOU\\"  CHECK THE CD OUT YOU WONT BE DISSAPPOINTED.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|I seem to own a DVD that's not from Dreamworks/Go Fish.  I forgot how I got it (most likely from eBay).  But the cover of the DVD I have (see the left pic &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">here&lt;/a>) is significantly different than what's shown here.   <br /> <br />For my copy, I found the subtitle confusing.  So perhaps the trade-off is that the Dreamworks release has more coherent subtitles?  This movie inherently dealt with a lot of abstract topics, so confusing subtitles really made things a lot worse.  With the first Ghost In The Shell, for example, I could get by with mediocre subtitles, but not this one. <br /> <br />So.  From what I got out of it, the main story is pretty simple: a bunch of geisha robots are killing their human customers.  And Section 9, the elite group of covert ops, is asked to investigate it.  These guys are like the FBI/CIA/NSA all rolled into one, I guess.  Two main guys follow the investigation to an industrial city and eventually end up breaking into an underwater facility (both physically and electronically) where the robots are manufactured.  The good/bad news is that's only about 25% of the story; the other 75% deals with atmosphere, mind hacking, existential discussion about souls, political intrigue, and exploration of the relationships and lives of the characters, including a brief encounter with a character from &lt;a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Shell-Atsuko-Tanaka/dp/6304493681\\">the previous movie&lt;/a> that now literally live in the Net (Internet?).   <br /> <br />I mentioned atmosphere because there are some segments that contribute nothing to the plot but are there to define the world in which this story lies.  The parade of the Chinese-inspired floats and the flight sequence at the middle of the film, for example, are marginally relevant.  But they were extended sequences that end up giving us an awesome depiction of a wonderous world and shows off some quite impressive CG displays. <br /> <br />This would be quite an interesting movie if you can figure out the dialogue despite the subtitles.  One more motivation to learn Japanese, I suppose. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I've read other reviews of people complaining about the length of the CD compared to other artists. IL DIVO are not other artists. The work that goes into their music and their vocalizations and languages and being able to convert certain songs I'm sure takes a lot of time. I'd rather have a top quality album of 40-some minutes rather than a longer album of less than quality music. IL DIVO is candy for the ears and if you have their DVD, they're candy for the eyes(for us ladies). It's all about beautiful music, REAL music. Romance is alive and well, Thank you Sebastien, Carlos, David, Urs, and also Simon for founding IL DIVO. I've not yet had the honor of seeing them in concert, hopefully day I will.
0811729117|5.0|This is an awesome piece of history, from a man that lived it and did it.  I had the personal honor of meeting Otto Carius here in Germany, he is sharp and very intelligent.  While I was serving as a US Tank Battalion S3, he shared with me many of the same situations we encounter today with our Tanks and our Tankers!

0393327655|1.0|I don't really see the difference between the left wing militant atheists and the right wing militant christians. Harris spends a lot of time on how religion is dangerous to society, when in fact what is dangerous is extremism. As a man with some very extreme views, Harris is the real danger. Never trust an author who doesn't take the time and effort to remove himself from his own arguement enough to examine it and wonder if he's become as bad as his \\"enemies\\". A very disapointing, and at time frightening, book.
0812976525|4.0|As the point person for a disinformation group representing Big Tobacco, Nick Naylor has a bit of a superiority complex. When another flack who handles alcohol shares her pain, he cuts her off by figuring her product kills less than a fourth as many people as his does.<br /><br />\\"Two hundred and seventy something a day,\\" Nick scoffs. \\"Well wow-wee. That's probably how many people die every day from slipping on bars of soap in the bathtub.\\"<br /><br />Christopher Buckley's 1994 novel \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" arrived in time for the backlash against political correctness and liberal Democrat big-mommyism. Telling the cheerfully amoral tale of Naylor's rise and fall in justifying America's last legal drug habit, Buckley presents a fierce satire that pulls in government, media, and Hollywood, in a vein suggestive of Evelyn Waugh, though it seemed to me more directly inspired by Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire Of The Vanities.\\"<br /><br />Buckley even gives us a bit of mystery and suspense when Naylor finds himself the apparent target of a zealous anti-smoking group, though the resulting FBI investigation only gets Naylor in more hot water. Beyond his drop-dead quips and clever use of reality, Buckley's greatest accomplishment here is how he creates a rooting interest in Naylor without his losing a drop of his basic malignancy. He's so funny and clever we forgive him a lot.<br /><br />The same is true for Buckley, who paints word pictures with a very broad brush, drops words like \\"bibulating\\" and \\"pecunious\\" with a flair perhaps even grander than his famous father William F., and wraps up major story arcs with simplistic overease. Nick has a son we think is going to be a key part of the story, but is only introduced and abandoned instead. Perhaps one reason for Naylor's nasty charm is Buckley, unlike his famous father, doesn't seem to think much of people; it's not so difficult to sympathize with a Merchant of Death when so many of those around him deserve his business.<br /><br />That may be selling Buckley short, though; he gives us a pair of scenes here that manage to be quite arresting and emotional. One features Naylor awakening to find himself in Washington's most famous cemetery, watching a bum light a cigarette on the Eternal Flame. Another shows his attempt to buy off a former Marlboro Man now dying of cancer and talking too much about it to the media. There is a note of redemption in this second episode, though Buckley presents it so well you don't know whether its for real or just Naylor playing another virtuoso hand.<br /><br />Virtuosity is something Naylor and Buckley have in common, and anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" quite a bit. Though it lacks the vision or uplift of \\"Bonfire Of The Vanities,\\" it is a quick, breezy read that manages to make amorality seem like good dirty fun.h; he gives us a pair of scenes here that manage to be quite arresting and emotional.

B000J103YI|5.0|This is a fantastic soundtrack.  I've heard all the hype associated with the movie and the interviews with all the actors that I HAD to check this out.  It's so good and I can't stop playing it.  Jennifer, Beyonce and Anika start out the cd with the cool and fast paced Move which is one of my favourite songs.  I also love the power ballad Listen and the title track Dreamgirls.  Eddie Murphy reminds us again that he isn't too bad of a singer.  The song Cadillac Car is great and he also does a lot in I Want You Baby and Steppin To The Bad Side.  I also love Patience which is an original song that was written for this movie and didn't appear in the broadway show version.  The whole cd has a great broadway showtune sound to it, and I hope this is a sign that the movie is going to be as great as this.  I really like this cd and I think it will have wide appeal to everyone even though it's more showy music than mainstream hit music.  I love it.
B000GY729M|5.0|On first listen of 'Sam's Town', I didn't much like it and bought the album thinking it was going to be a twin to 'Hot Fuss'.  However, with every listen, this album just improved.  'Sam's Town' is more polished than The Killers freshman album and the songwriting is fantastic, not repetitive like some songs from 'Hot Fuss'.  Although 'Hot Fuss' will always be one of my favorites, 'Sam's Town' has won my heart.  It has more of a rock sound than 'Hot Fuss' ever could and the influence of U2 and Bruce Springsteen are apparent.  This album probably will be looked back upon as one of the great albums of the last 20 years.  Yes, I said it.  4+++ stars for this album!
B000002H33|5.0|Well I would have to say that Metallica's Master of Puppet CD is the best after Ride The Lightning and before And Justice For All. Most of the songs are great with great classic intros like \\"Battery\\",\\"Master Of Puppets\\", and \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\". Metallica is for people with good taste and Rolling Stones is for people with poor taste. Highly recommended.
B00008LOS1|5.0|For a band that originally released this album, way back in 1977, it's a testament to the incredibly articulate writing skills of \\"Pete Townsend\\", and the Exuberant, Passionate and Visceral performances of all concerned, that this album, is still amongst the definitive examples of Hard-Rock / Album Rock template, that startles some 30 years later.  <br /> <br />Its a driving and insistent album, with the band truly hitting their stride (and largely considered to be their best work), with elements of Blues-Rock, Hard-Rock, acoustic flavoured workouts, Country-tinged shuffles & Earnest Ballads, combining to make an album that captures elements of the band's personality, and most invigorating performances.  <br /> <br />Whether it is the anthemic \\"Baba O'Riley that is a massive statement of intent, with all the bombastic flurry and major chord workouts that you'd expect, but with the significant use of synthesizer's on this band (Pete was constantly working to refine their sound). Or the totally stomping album-Rock  <br />of \\"Bargain\\", with Keith Moon's furious drumming (proving himself to be as accomplished a drummer, as I've ever heard), along with John Entwistle delivering all kinds of melodic and rhythmic flourishes, and the soaring chorus of \\"The best I've ever Had\\", it's hard not to feel an emotional lump on the throat when hearing this.  <br /> <br />Precise & emotionally poignant balladry is the order of the day for \\"The Song is Over\\", and as aptly as The Who can deliver intricate Hard Rock, they also prove themselves to be equally adept at delivering a ballad that doesn't feel force or contrived. As everything here (instrumentation-wise) is far more subtle & less flamboyant, and as sorrowful, emotionally charged and heartbreaking, and sung from the heart, as all the finest ballad should be, and to have a chorus that sings \\"I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea\\", and not sound musically misplaced, is another feather in the cap of the song writing skills of Townshend.  <br /> <br />Surprising that it may seem, my personal favourite on this album is the Country-tinged Blues rock of \\"Going Mobile\\" which although there are no weak tracks on this album, I feel that this track frequently gets passed over by most, in favour of the more well-known / Established tracks. Its the use of a Bluegrass twang to the guitar instrumentation that feels so freewheeling, that It's not hard to picture the imagine of mobile travellers (of which the song is in reference to), with a lyrical bent that not only is quite witty in its construction \\"I can pull up by the curb, I can make it on the road, Goin' mobile, I can stop in any street, And talk with people that we meet, Goin' mobile.....Keep me movin\\". Show a layer of complexity in the song writing, for what is essentially one of the lesser known tracks on the album, and the relatively high tempo song, and whirling folky guitars and graceful country flourishes throughout the track mask the tongue-in-cheek humour, that is as captivating as it is funny, for it hard not to raise a smile when at the 'Leave it all behind' mentality surfaces on the lyric \\"I don't care about pollution, I'm an air-conditioned gypsy, That's my solution, Watch the police and the tax man miss me....I'm mobile\\".  <br /> <br />The second Ballad \\"Behind Blue eyes\\", (That would later be covered by Limp Bizkit on his \\"Results may Vary\\" album), is arguably as accomplished a ballad as \\"The Song is Over\\" (possibly even surpassing it, due to it more stripped-down aesthetic, and rather more reliance on acoustic arrangement). And the album closer \\"Won't get Fooled again\\" is possibly one of the strongest cuts, to finish the album out on. A largely rock delivered anthem, that at 8 minutes long, you'd be fooled into thinking that It's overreaching itself, but the combination of all the musicians involved, moving constantly through various stylistic changes, the prominent use of the synthesizer's, stunning drumming and slick guitar work, along with some fine worded lyrics \\"I'll tip my hat to the new constitution, Take a bow for the new revolution, Smile and grin at the change all around, Pick up my guitar and play Just like yesterday\\", showed a band, at the very height of their musical prowess, no question about it.  <br /> <br />If you haven't heard this album before (for some reason), then for an album devised in the 70's, you'd be forgiven for thinking that It might sound horribly dated now, but just like other astonishing albums in that were published in the highly creative 70's period (Led Zeppelin's - \\"Physical Graffiti\\", Can's - \\"Tago Mago\\", Neil Young's - \\"After the Gold Rush\\", David Bowie's - \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", Pink Floyd's - \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", Nick Drake - Bryter Layter\\", Marvin Gaye's - What's Going On\\", Stevie Wonder's - \\"Innervisions\\", The Velvet Underground's - Loaded)......as albums that refuse to sound dated or irrelevant in the face of new methods of musical recordings or changes in the musical tastes of the general public. Arguably the finest album that they recorded (although some may disagree), this is one of those albums that frequently charts in those \\"Greatest Albums Ever\\" polls that you frequently come across in magazines or Websites, and that because it's really is one of the truly great albums, to have been ever made, and anyone even remotely thinking about collecting a rock collection of albums, cannot consider it complete until they have this astonishing album. <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|I love Metallica. They really rock. I can't get enough of their music recently. They were miles better than overrated bands like Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones who suck terribly. Kirk Hammett is a miles better guitar player than Rolling Stones' Keith Richmond who just can't play guitar at all AND Lars Ulrich is much better drummer than Willie Whatts. Ride The Lightning is a great album and has several great rock anthems like the beautiful \\"Fade to Black', 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', 'Fight Fire With Fire', and 'Ride The Lightning'. Get all these Metallica classic albums and stay far away from the latest Rolling Stones CD which is the lousiest CD after Dark Side Of The Moon and Queen Greatest Hits.  <br />PS. Metallica are just as great as Foreigner, Dire Straits, Tom Petty, The Clash, and Green Day.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Let's see - how many times have I seen this trilogy? Hmmmmmmm ... I'm getting old and graying - and I'm STILL enthralled by it. <br /> <br />My only regret is that most of these \\"boxed\\" DVD's come only in Widescreen format - that's a shame since many of us don't own/or want a widescreen TV.
B00005JPBD|5.0|Volver is probably Almodovar's best work about women living in pain, chaos, trauma, and hardship since All About My Mother. I can't decide which film is more superior, because both movies deals with motherhood in a different way and I enjoyed the actresses just as much especially Penelope Cruz who literally poured her heart and soul into the role of Raimunda, and I won't be surprised if she gets her first Oscar nom. Both films serve up equal amount of comic and dramatic moments and every actresses in Volver gets to shed a bucket of tears. I would say this film is less daring or provocative since it doesn't cover subjects like transgenderism, homosexuals, and prostituation that was seen in All About My Mother. It concentrates on the subject of incest, abuse, and abandonment, murder, revenge, and reconcillation. It's marvellous that first time Cruz gets a role that's so much more challenging and entertaining then her other acclaimed roles in films like Don't Move and Woman On Top, and she was able to make me smile, laugh, and move me tears.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz had so many mesmerizing moments in this film. The scene when she rejects to have sex with her drunk and horny husband and he procedds to masterbate beside her causing to silently shed her tears was one of the early moments in the film that captivated me. One of ther more striking moments came in when she held her daughther and cried until her mascara ran. At that moment the audiences do not know why the accidental murder of her husband by her daughter was so impacting to her, but it had devastated her more then it did for her teenage daughter. Between these kind of emotional and dramatic moments, there's a right amout of comic relief from other brilliant female characters. Carmen Maura was quite funny at first playing a mysterious and goofy \\"ghost\\" came back from the dead to fulfill her last wishes. Beneath the surface, this woman had endured her share of rage, vengence, regret, and she was abandoned by her daughter(Raimunda). She seeks her daughter's forgiveness and wanted to make amends to her. There was this scene when she was hidding in the car while listening to Raimunda singing a song that was taught by her to a film crew at the restaurant, she started to cry at the same time when her daughter was crying during the singing, and that was a very memorable moment in this film. It was amazing to see cruz sing that song which reflects 20 years of emotions and she was able to look so natural while crying at the same time. Both Lola Duenas and Blanca Portillo had turned in wonderful supporting performances.<br /><br />As always, I just loved the cinematography, the art direction/set dec, and the beautiful score. This film is very enjoyable to watch and it's rare that an art film can be so entertaining and it's no doubt an international crowd-pleaser!er daughter(Raimunda).

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|When I heard that Jay Dee had passed away earlier this year, I went out and picked up his final release, 2006's \\"Donuts\\" instrumental album. I had been a fan of much of his production work in the nineties, especially his music made with the Pharcyde, A Tribe Called Quest, Common, and Slum Village. I have always considered him one of the most talented producers in hip hop and his death was a real loss to the music community. But even that couldn't prepare me for what an awesome listen \\"Donuts\\" is. \\"Donuts\\" is really a joy to listen to. I could listen to these tracks for hours. These are really unlike any instrumentals I have ever heard. Whereas the regular rap instrumental becomes tedious with its sixteen bars, hook, sixteen bars, hook, bridge, and hook pattern, Jay Dee's have absolutely no pattern. These songs are perfect to listen to and really entertaining, and in most cases I think putting rap verses over them would almost ruin them. Dilla compiled 31 tracks for this album, and most are only about a minute and a half long, which is a perfect length, not too short but never allowing a dull moment. \\"Donuts\\" is one of my favorite music releases of 2006 and I highly recommend it to all.<br /><br />Jay Dee's style on this album is very focused and unlike any of his other work I've heard with other artists. Instead of regular hip hop sounds, he is heavy on guitar instrumentals, which makes an awesome sound, some comes across like a sort of soul and indie rock fusion. His style sounds nostalgic of a musical era long past, but you can't quite put your finger on it. This is J-Dilla's trademark. The music is often so beautiful. Songs like \\"The Diff'rence\\" and \\"Time: The Donut of the Heart\\" sound like really heartfelt tunes. But Jay Dee is not just limited by traditional instrumentals, and he finds samples for his songs from all kinds of unlikely sources. He samples movie dialogue, television and radio commercials, and speeches to cater to his works. The vocal samples on \\"Donuts\\" are really interesting, funny to the point of being almost eerie. Many come from obscure 60s and 70s soul tunes, and the lyrics combined with the titles of the track make for an odd effect. It sounds like he is trying to convey a message. Even though most of the time they probably don't make sense, it creates a feeling like if you were to hear someone yelling but not be able to make out the words. \\"Lightworks\\" is the best example of this quality. You can tell Jay Dee had a lot of fun creating these tracks, and they really are a joy to listen to.<br /><br />It's ironic that \\"Donuts\\" is Jay Dee's last musical statement, because although it is just an instrumental album, it's very representative of Jay Dee's career in whole. Like everything he did, this music is experimental, unique, and tinkered with until it was engineered to perfection. It's sad to think that this album might not be at all recognized if not for Jay Dee's passing, but I'm glad that finally a man and his work is at least a little recognized, especially after being slept on for so long. You need not be a rap fan to enjoy \\"Donuts,\\" because very little of the album sounds at all like hip hop or comes of as anything really close to it. All kinds of music fans will enjoy \\"Donuts\\" for its great tracks and originality. Rest in peace to one of the best.\\"Donuts\\" are really interesting, funny to the point of being almost eerie.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I thought the documentary was great.  I still have questions - like why were there next to no hurricanes in 2006 and why are the oceans not boiling due to the current CO2 levels in the atmosphere?  Although I believe the information presented in the film to be largely true, I also believe the earth to be at least as complex as the human body - created just as wonderfully and intricately.  That said there are just unknowns about how the earth copes with stress (or doesn't cope) as there are with how the body heals (or doesn't).   <br /> <br />So I will set my questions aside for this reason - what does it hurt to be a good steward of our planet?  It takes a few extra minutes to put my recycling in the bin.  Even if global warming is a hoax, who wants landfills?  I do a little more research when I buy a car. But isn't that smart anyway?  And doesn't it benefit me financially to drive a car with higher gas mileage/lower emissions?  I spend an extra 10 cents on yogurt manufactured by a company that offsets 100% of its CO2 emissions.  But that yogurt also has no artificial sweeteners and no chemicals - isn't that better for me anyway?  I walk my kids to school.  Hello, heard of childhood obesity?  I reuse plastic grocery bags (and paper ones too, for that matter).  Isn't this just being frugal, thrifty and smart?  I buy \\"green\\" electricity from my power company - don't I want to step outside and breathe good, non-polluted air? <br /> <br />The message here is that it is NOT DIFFICULT and NOT A HARDHSIP to be an environmentalist - or don't call yourself an environmentalist - say you are protecting the earth, helping to create a clean home for your family or being a steward of our greatest natural resource - the pale blue dot.  Each of us can do little things that take less time cumulatively than getting a haircut every 6 weeks, cost us very little and are directly beneficial.  In this age of instant gratification, it makes no sense to me why someone would not want the immediate effects of earth stewardship - they are practical and instantly beneficial.  Even if you don't believe the long-term gloom and doom, don't you want the immediate good parts of the environmental movement - less landfill, sweet-smelling air, exercise, decreased fuel costs, and health?  Shame on you if you don't.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|The people who bad mouthed this album are probably waiting for another season of American Idol, and are besides themselves in the meantime.  That and the fact that they can't get away from their computers to go buy the album, because they would get disconnected from the Matrix.  Which means they don't own the cd, and if they do they should change their email address and their IP addresses, because they didn't pay for the album and are in violation of Copyright Law.  Tragic Kingdom of Losers online.   <br /> <br />Anyhow, Gwen has managed to pull something unexpected by many people.  The fact that she had a baby, a tour, and has managed to put out a second album following up to the 8X Platinum Success of her 2004 Album is quite a lot.  Then she is going on tour again in Spring of 2007. Busy Schedule, but hey she is doing a good job.   <br /> <br />The album has a lot of production by The Neptunes, and I used to get so irritated with Pharrell Williams, but the two of them put some very crafty over the top irritating but catchy stuff together.  Last Time it was Hollaback Girl (annoyingly the #2 song of 2005) and this time it is Yummy track #7.  The last song Wonderful Life, a mellow collaboration with former 4 Non Blondes (1994's What's Up) singer Linda Perry, who is a music genius and talented as hell.(Disc 2 \\"Back to Basics\\" Christina Aguilera, some of her other art currently in heavy rotation).  I am not sure what else came out this Tuesday, but if Gwen doesn't debut at #1 on Billboard's 200 Albums Chart, then there are some serious problems with the American buying public.  If you are a music lover, then I am sure you are already well aware of this problem, how many seasons of American Idol have there been?   <br />Anyhow, Gwen is fierce, she is about to be multi-platinum again, and anyone who doesn't like this album should probably actually listen to it first, or stop googling for Britney Spears crotch pics. . . That is enough to make anyone get hateful very quickly.
B00005JPAJ|4.0|its an excellent film, thou it's not entertainment. it makes you think.<br /><br />having said that it is also gutwrenching. and scary. and sad. and it will not make you feel good about the world you live in.<br /><br />it will make you feel extremely helpless, cuz things happen and you can't do anything about it cuz noone listens and noone cares.<br /><br />4 stories told at the same time, all connected thru objects and people who connect them although they live world apart, both geographically and in terms of way of life.<br /><br />all telling a story of a cold and scary world we live in: where police don't ask questions before they shoot whether in Morocco or in the States, where people are alone and on their own, where noone listens to each other, and noone cares of the fellow human being.<br /><br />i walked out of the movie theatre wasted, but glad someone has done something to say what we all feel - how alone and lonely we all are, surrounded by 6 billion people.
B00005JPC7|4.0|This film seems strangely out of place in the theatres this year. Why? Because it was original and enjoyable all at the same time! During the movie, I couldn't stop thinking about how much I'd like to shake hands with the person who wrote this. They've won the \\"Best Original Screenplay of the Year\\" in my books. I also commend the director. I mean, Will Ferrell and Dustin Hoffman in the same room? Or how about Emma Thompson and Queen Latifa exchanging dialogue? When I first heard this, visions of Orlando Bloom and Kierstin Dunst pulling on some obviously oversized roles in Elizabethtown and Julie Andrews stooping down into her plastic Disney tiara in Princess Diaries flashed through my head. But within twenty minutes of watching Will Ferrel NOT over-act, NOT make an obscene comment, NOT give us any hint he'd ever been anything but a boring IRS agent and NOT wither in the presence of Hoffman, I realized the director was on to something and gave him my undivided attention and faith. And QueenL was so un-intimidated by EmmaT, I felt that they could have been sisters, except for the obvious reasons of course.<br /><br />All the characters worked so well together and in their own skin, it almost didn't matter what they were saying, I just liked watching them live. But the script was a treat too, Emma Thompson certainly taking and expertly delivering the bulk of the most clever lines. I love how Thompson will do 100% for any character she plays - she'll twitch, pick up a habit, look gosh-awful for the complete run of the film and demand the viewers attention in every frame.<br /><br />For Ferrell, this film was about proving his talent. With lines that were occasionally funny but never abnormally so, a character with the imagination of a carboard box and an audience that is expecting him to perform a dirty slapstick routine, Ferrell somehow comes across irresitably likable and definitely suceeds in proving his talent.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaall did very well - note worthy but a little short of brilliant.<br /><br />Hoffman is hilarious and, as always, a pleasure to watch. His comfort level with the camera puts the audience at ease - we know he's flawless.<br /><br />The unfamiliar actor playing Ferrell's friend provided some of the best laughs in the movie - in fact, I started laughing every time I saw him, his hi-tech nerd mannerisms subtley hilarious.<br /><br />The plot itself was the powerful propellor of this sucess. Creative and smart, the story within a story is marvelously told. The audience feels directly connected to Harold Crick because while HE is trying to figure out if  HIS plot is a comedy or tragedy, WE are trying to figure our wether OUR plot is a comedy or a tragedy. The movie performed right in the middle of a see-saw, leaning slightly to the \\"comedy\\" side one moment then slightly to the \\"tragedy\\" side the next. It kept me wondering till the last frame and the credits rolled. Not that it finally revealed what it was. Rather, it satisfied you with its lack of a catagory - you didn't want to put this movie in a box.<br /><br />To conclude, fiction is good but I prefer something a little Stranger Than Fiction.t a little short of brilliant.  <br />Hoffman is hilarious and, as always, a pleasure to watch.

B000F4MLZ8|5.0|One of my favorite discoveries of 2006.  Great record with a nod to Simon and Garfunkel/ Nick Drake style singer-songwriter material.  Great lyrics, melodies and harmonies.  Take a listen to Star Mile and Closer and you decide.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|I bought both the Unrated and the theatrical DVDs. In both versions, Crockett and Isabella are dancing in Cuba to a live band (it's Chapter 7 or 8, I believe). The music fades and an Audioslave song starts playing over the soundtrack. On the Theatrical edition DVD, it's a smooth transition. On the Unrated, the Cuban music fades out, there's a moment of silence and then the Audioslave song abruptly kicks in a few seconds late.  <br /> <br />Has anyone else noticed this? Is it an audio glitch or some creative decision by Michael Mann? It just seems odd.....
B00000DQSZ|3.0|Years ago I purchased the EMI version of Trans Europa Express and have enjoyed it so much I decided to add the Capitol version to my last shopping cart so I culd have the English lyrics. When I played it I noticed lots of low-frequency rumble, especially on the first track - Europe Endless. I popped the EMI version in and it is totally quiet! I guess for $10.98 you get what you pay for but I find this recording unacceptable so I ordered the $15.98 version to see if the problem disappears. Here are the details of the \\"flawed\\" version:<br /><br />Audio CD (September 26, 1995)<br /><br />Original Release Date: 1977<br /><br />Number of Discs: 1<br /><br />Format: Original recording remastered<br /><br />Label: Capitol<br /><br />ASIN: B00000DQSZ
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Awesome CD.  Not like LAMB but that isn't a bad thing.  IMHO, the best songs are \\"Wonderful life,\\" with Martin Gore from Depeche Mode, \\"Early Winter,\\" and \\"4 in the Morning.\\"  I respect Gwen for always pushing the envelope.  People complain that they want her to sound more like No Doubt but that's not the point of being a solo artist (sounding like the group you came from).  Bravo to Gwen for stepping out of her box and trying a new sound.  This CD really grows on you.
1400031362|3.0|If you've read the previous books in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, then you know what you have coming: Mma Ramotswe, a kindly version of Dr. Phil solving mysteries in Botswana, goes about her business. She helps a government man ascertain whether his brother's wife is trying to poison his brother; her assistant, Mma Kutsi, helps a beauty pageant figure out which candidates would be most worthy representatives of Botswana; Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni battles clinical depression; and so on.  <br /> <br />This entry in the series is, for the most part, as pleasant as the others, although I found myself growing weary at times. Smith spends a less time on mystery here and more on Mma Ramotswe's personal life. Smith conveys the national pride of Botswana well. At least one of the subplots (that of the beauty pageant) was resolved rather weakly, and another subplot (involving a little boy found out in the wilderness) seemed completely peripheral. <br /> <br />Because I've done some work in East Africa (far from Botswana), friends often ask me how accurate Smith's portrayal is. My principal answer is that Africa (with it's many different countries) is very heterogeneous, so I don't know. That piqued my interest, though, as to how the novels have been received in Botswana: after some poking I was only able to find two relevant sources, both positive*: (1) a University of Botswana history professor recommends the novels as a \\"deeply sympathetic (and very funny) view of present-day Botswana\\"; and (2) the head of Botswana's tourism association. So at least you may rest assured that the books aren't seen as a complete misrepresentation. <br /> <br />I listened to the unabridged audio recording narrated by Lisette Lecat (published by Recorded Books). As always, Lecat does an excellent job. If you enjoy her narration, I strongly recommend her performance of Alexandra Fuller's excellent memoir of growing up in Zimbabwe, Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight (also published by Recorded Books). <br /> <br />* I found both of these sources cited in Elfi Bettinger's essay, \\"Riddles in the Sand of the Kalahari,\\" in the book Postcolonial Postmortems (ed. Christine Matzke), p. 162. I then verified both sources myself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen or even heard about the Firefly series when it originally aired. My fourteen year old son had suggested renting the movie, \\"Serenity\\" which is based on the TV series and we watched or should I say experienced it together. It is a great movie and deserves a sequel. I immediately purchased the complete series and we watched those episodes and were thoroughly entertained. I highly recommend watching the Firefly series and exposing your family and friends to a great event that has stories and characters that are worth the money to see.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|One of the greatest films ever made.  The astonishing thing is that the film reflects accurately the Amercian psyche as well as Kim Jong Il.
0618680004|3.0|Dawkins relates the bloody legacy of religions through the ages, and also provides credible documentation that a number of early American leaders were not believers (vs. today's continual assertions that &#34;we are a Christian nation,&#34; etc.).  Also reported was the testing of the power of prayer vs. CABG patients (American Heart Journal, 4/06), added evidence that leading scientists' (eg. Einstein, Hawkings) support for belief in God was misconstrued (eg. taken out of context) and the fact that the four Gospels are selective (eg. St. Thomas' version is full of accounts of Jesus' &#34;magic tricks&#34; as a youth, rendering it less &#34;acceptable&#34;).  It was also interesting to read that data show that the greater one's scientific eminence or IQ, the less likely one was to be a religious believer.<br /><br />As for &#34;proof,&#34; Dawkins' &#34;bottom line&#34; is that the most credible argument (something/someone had to create the universe at the beginning) suffers from the problem that if one assumes God was the creator, one is still left to explain the creation of God.<br /><br />The &#34;bad news&#34; is that &#34;The God Delusion&#34; does go on for too long, and eventually becomes tedious.
B000244EMO|4.0|Maybe they should have sent assassins.<br /><br />In 1987's Predator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, a major in charge of a rescue team who handles the missions no one else can handle.  When he is called on by his good friend Apollo Creed aka the General to find a missing cabinet minister who is lost in the jungle, he thinks it's because he's the best.  He has no idea it's because this is really a suicide mission wherein they will be hunted by a sci-fi creature in the jungle who can blend in with the woods, has heat seeking guns on his shoulders, and hops from tree to tree like a monkey.<br /><br />For some reason, this is the first time I've seen this movie and now that I've seen it, I'm a bit angry it took me so long.  Predator is Schwarzenegger in his heyday--all brawn, accent, and arrogance.  His team is just as impressive with a tracker who can sense the danger in the jungle, a tobacco-chewing redneck who \\"ain't got time to bleed,\\" and, of course, Apollo Creed as the guy who got them all into this mess.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Predator, this collector's edition is definitely the way to go.  Not only does it have a sneak peek at Alien v. Predator, but it has an entire disc of extras with behind the scenes featurettes, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sction/adventure and sci-fi movies; it's the best of both worlds.
0385312083|3.0|I have just finished this book, it is short and can be read quickly. While it can be read in a day, it really takes much longer to really digest. On the surface it is very disjointed, but some where inside you, you know this story is saying something clear and loud. At times I believe I should rate it lower, then reconsidering I see the genius of it, and think it should be higher. Perhaps this was the authors goal, to make one think. At least I think I have an idea what was happening in this story, which was far from the experience I had with Faulkners \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" (which I gave up on).
B000002UJQ|5.0|I am 37 years old and my favorite decade was the 90s. <br /> <br />I just BOUGHT everything the 90s sold me musically both literally and figuratively. <br /> <br />Beside the obvious choices....Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc.. I am a FANATICAL fan of the greatest American band ever in my opinion....The Smashing Pumpkins. <br /> <br />Music was so raw and fresh then, and still is now thanks to the barren wasteland the 90s rock scene left behind with very few exceptions (System of a Down, White Stripes and a small group of others). <br /> <br />My point being that I already had the 90s forever in my heart, ears and mind as the greatest decade in music history. <br /> <br />But I am a fan of \\"best of\\" lists and my Pumpkins have topped quite a few with either of their 2 classics, Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, the latter of which is the best album ever recorded in my opinion. <br /> <br />But upon viewing these \\"best of\\" lists about the 90s I noticed \\"OK Computer\\" as a thorn in my side that kept finishing for the most part ahead of the Pumpkins' works. <br /> <br />Finally about 4 months back I took the plunge and bought the damn thing to see what the hype was all about and be able to at least somewhat objectively justify that it was overrated. <br /> <br />I tried and tried and tried to NOT like this cd. <br /> <br />But with each listen it became harder and harder to deny what I was hearing. <br /> <br />Finally, it felt good to get myself out of my self imposed \\"denial\\" and admit that this is an amazing record. <br /> <br />If I had to rate 90s records, my top 5 would still be: <br /> <br />1. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness....Pumpkins <br />2. Little Earthquakes....Tori Amos <br />3. Siamese Dream.....Pumpkins <br />  <br />But while #5 would be Tori Amos' Boys for Pele, Radiohead would occupy the 4th spot already (4 months later) with this amazing piece of art. <br /> <br />That is saying something because none of my top 5 grew on me asfast as this one did. <br /> <br />It took a while and like alot of other reviewers I see here and other places, we can agree that OK Computer is not your \\"standard\\" cd even for a \\"unique\\" decade like the 90s, upon the first few listens. <br /> <br />Even diehard Radiohead fans have stated as much. <br /> <br />It took me a while but I was determined to give it a Real SHOT like I did with the other cds on my list, none of which are immediately essential. <br /> <br />My persistence paid off IN SPADES ! <br /> <br />This is amazing, brilliant and way ahead of it's time, even now in my opinion. <br /> <br />I'm still in my first few cycles of listening all the way through and some of the songs are still \\"growing on me\\" but several have already grown. <br /> <br />Especially....Karma Police, Paranoid Android, No Surprises, Airbag, Let Down and the hauntingly beautiful Exit Music (for a film). <br /> <br />I won't get into the merits of each track but the middle of Paranoid Android where it gets slower and dimmer reminds me of being at a wedding and it suddenly becoming a funeral, if that makes any sense. <br /> <br />But in a beautiful way, which may make even less sense. <br /> <br />\\"Rain down from a great height\\" <br /> <br />Wow. <br /> <br />I recently saw a clip of that song live from an episode of Later with Jules Holland from British TV and I don;t know if I've ever seen a song performed more perfectly live than that, it sounded so good I started paying extra attention to the band to see if they were pulling an Ashlee Simpson and faking it onstage because it sounded so much like the album version...for such an intricate song, that was truly impressive. <br /> <br />Exit Music, as I now know, was from the end of the recent remake of Romeo and Juliet and now makes total sense to me....what a great F**KING song. <br /> <br />I am now a big Radiohead fan and have subsequently bought \\"The Bends\\" and love that as well. <br /> <br />As far as the legion of Radiohead worshippers, it's safe to say, albeit a decade later, you can now count me IN !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Incubus keeps getting better and better. Every single track included in Light Grenades has its own life and sounds different from anything you have heard before. From the beginning to the end, listening to this album is a sensorial experience. Highly recommended.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|I have noticed that several other 'reviewers' were less than thrilled with the sound quality of this box set; without going into too much repetitive detail, and especially without knowing what kind of audio set-up they are utilizing, I can only add the following:   The six CD's are all in remastered (or re-remastered, as another reviewer observed)stereo sound, and all have bonus tracks of varying quality and interest. Overall, the CD's sonics seem a little punchier, with wider dynamic range and improved imaging.  The DVD contains several sonic options, including Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, DTS 5.1, DTS Stereo, Advanced Resolution Surround, and Advanced Resolution Stereo (DVD-A).   The sonics on this set are far superior to any previous release on compact disc (many high-end analog set-ups will still outperform CD by a very noticeable margin). The remix is basically true to the original intent of the artists and in keeping with the sound we're all so familiar with. Having said that, however, I must put forth the notion that  hearing music coming from behind (as it does in most 'surround' mixes) seems unnatural to me. I have never been to a concert where there were musicians stationed behind me, and when there WERE noises coming from  back there, it was usually due to the concert venue having terrible acoustics/echo problems. Fortunately, most of the better-sounding surround releases on SACD or DVD-A utilize the back channels sparingly. I don't know about you, but MY ears only focus in one direction at a time. Unless I turn my head toward the rear, or increase the level of the rear speakers to make them more audible, the information coming from behind can be distracting - or even annoying (like those bad acoustics). Music should be heard as if the band/musicians were on the stage live, the way it is in real life. I know, surround is still a relatively recent addition to recorded music, and the 'new' hasn't worn off yet. But ask yourself...is it realistic?     Reguardless, the music on the DVD versions HAS been remixed AND remastered, and while it is fun to hear these tracks in surround (at least once or twice, anyway), it is the Advanced Rez Stereo mix that makes this set a must-buy for Doors fans. With audiophile-quality playback equipment, the sound is exquisitely rich and the imaging lifelike, especially taking into account the age of the material (good though it may be, there is no realistic way for recordings that are going on four decades old to compare to recent releases from the Eagles or Fleetwood Mac, as one dreamer put it). So, if you prefer your music the way the artist intended (in stereo, in this case), and you have the right equipment to take advantage of the DVD-A stereo mix, this box set IS the one to buy...and the one that settles for all time (or until the next improvement in audio quality and the inevitable re-release of these tracks yet AGAIN) which Doors collection is best.  P.S. The booklets in my set were pristine (unlike the experience another reviewer apparently had) and very informative and interesting to read; and the reason for only 4 stars above is because the audio quality varies from disc to disc with the later albums sounding somewhat better due to advancements in recording technology in the late '60s and early '70s, etc. An observation: the Doors CD's have always seemed to me to be a little 'light' in the bass region...and that remains the case here on some tracks/albums. But that's what tone controls are for.
1594200823|5.0|Thank God I stopped eating beef 12 years ago.  If I hadn't, I sure would now.  This book shows what this country and eventually the world is coming to.  I can't even eat any corn products now without feeling like I'm part of the consumer machine.  Another reviewer felt that the biodynamic farms aren't realistic in our world and he's right.  Everybody should stop eating beef.  If everyone read this book, the number of beef eaters would plummet, the fast food outlets would close up and a radical shift would happen ecologically and economically.  This would bring about chaos for a period of time, but I think it could still be a step in the right direction.  Read the book and pass it on to a friend.  You owe it to the next generation.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I love this.  It was done in 1984, but I love it. Similar style to  Princess Mononoke-hime.  I love the way in which Japanese animation can be so quiet.  I never realized how much constant music, as in most American/European animation, moves the action of the film even when nothing is really happening.  It's as though the viewer never gets to relax and just view.  In Japanese animation there are often lulls of  musicless movement that are very active but almost in a meditative internal sort of way.  It's really lovely and this film has many of those moments.  They still manage to engage the viewer but you can do so in a nice detached space.  No wonder western animation stresses me out so much.
B000ASSDVA|5.0|I earlier thought that El Cid deserved five stars.  This was based entirely on my viewing the film some forty five years ago.  Alas, I see things a bit differently during my AARP years.  El Cid is no more than a three star production.  The script writing is mediocre and there simply isn't enough development regarding the existential struggle between the Christian and Muslim cultures.  The producers regrettably focussed too much attention on the special effects and battle scenes---and not on the overall story. And yes, the Asian import DVD is abysmally awful. El Cid is indeed a beautiful movie on the original large screen.<br /><br />The film has one major redeeming virtue: it clearly shows that the Spaniards were merely defending their homeland.  The Arab Muslims were the bad guys.  They were the dominant slave owners and scoundrels of that period of history.  Christians and Jews were considered unworthy of decent treatment.  Muslims treated all nonbelievers as vile peoples of the Earth.  What are the chances of a remake in today's politically correct charged atmosphere?  Would the adherents of Islam rage against the honoring of El Cid, a true hero of Western Civilization?  He is fully deserving of our respect and adulation.  Which studio dares to tackle the long overdue project?  Should I hold my breath?<br /><br />David Thomson<br />Flares into Darkness
B000H0MKOC|4.0|I'm not really sure what I think of this film. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, more darkly humorous and ironic. Tragic in the right lighting. I did not know what to expect of it, and it did not go in the direction I thought it would. Likely that means it went in a better direction, as the crux of it begins and remains that it's not what you say but how you say it. Given that, this film shows great insight into rhetoric, which is poignant data about our entire means of distributing \\"information\\" at present.
055358202X|2.0|Reviewer Ross Blackman already wrote pretty much everything I wanted to convey.  The book is bloated and boring, and 2/3rds of it could have (and should have) been deleted, with no loss to the story development.  I'm sure some subtle items of significance were lost on me due to the dizzying and burdensome number of names and characters (including new ones), not to mention the years that have passed since I read the earlier books.  Must I memorize a telephone book of names to follow the story?  It felt like torture to read the Cersei chapters - she is an uninteresting and one-dimensional character. <br /> <br />I greatly fear, like other reviewers, that the author has caught Robert-Jordan-disease.  Since you are probably a fantasy reader, I don't have to explain further.  I have to compare this book to the first three in the Ice and Fire series, which I enjoyed and devoured.  And knowing that the author is capable of producing such wonderful books makes this poor fourth installment seem inexcusable.  I will cross my fingers for the next book...  Please, George, give us economical and tighter writing and engaging content.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|I had very high expectations of this film because I studied under the school of techniques put forth by the author of the book it was based on--Dr. Felicitas Goodman. She was a shaman, but in my eyes not only a shaman, but one of the last of the forerunners in the western world who was truly schooled in the olde way yet capable of working that path into the frequencies and energy currently available to the planet. She was a rare bird. Apart from her very open and well schooled view on shamanic work, she had the ability to blend the psychological, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual into her work to create amazing outcomes. She excluded nothing. So of course in that light the film had nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />The film is based on her book \\"The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel\\", and it's fantastic. The book is her translation of the documents and letters surrounding the possession and subsequent death of Annelise Michel. I could elaborate all day on what makes it unique in the field of depossession. Suffice it to say that she stumbled on some findings that if others in the western world had conceived, did not have the confidence to assert them publicly. I had read her other works before this one and already realized her contributions in shamanism, but when I read this book I really felt like I was reading the words of a pioneer in an incredibly misunderstood field of wellbeing.<br /><br />Anneliese was a young German woman from a very closed off town that was deeply religious. No really--deeply religious, which is very significant to her plight. As she became college aged and was faced with moving to the city and having a boyfriend she began to have problems. Thinking they were mental concerns she was treated for epilepsy. She insisted that she was possessed and the medications weren't helping. As she was an adult and could legally decide for herself, she eventually stopped taking the drugs, stopped eating, and died while the exorcism was being carried out. She essentially chose to starve herself to death. Her parents and two priests went to prison short-term for her death.<br /><br />The film butchered her story.

0753820250|5.0|Excellent read!  Loved every minute... good literature - nothing new or amazing, but one of my best reads of the year.  Would read it again just a few months later.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Really well done.  Apart from not having read In Cold Blood, the only thing about it that I didn't really know was what Harper Lee was at one point actually quite public.  I always thought she was reclusive.  I thought the tension on Hoffman's part was well done, but I notice that people in review seem to emphasize Capote's need to get his book done as his primary conflict in holding compassion for the killers, but I also felt that he reached a point that he was repulsed by their actions and felt trapped morally, too...
B000AJIAOO|4.0|After an exceptional debut with the album \\"Enter\\", many fans felt a little bit dissapointed with \\"Mother Earth\\", a very operistic piece compared with brutal songs like Deep Within (from Enter). Overall, Mother Earth is not a bad album, but too different from the first one. Silent Force is, in some way, a coming back to their roots, with nice vocals but also with the taste of real metal. <br /> <br />Check the DVD, is amazing. There is a release (imported from the UK) that includes a couple of bonus tracks (Destroyed & Jane Doe) and a DVD with four songs from a Germany concert. The production of the DVD was remarkable: high quality video and superb audio. A videoclip (Stand my Ground) is also included, and seems there was enough budget because is really well done.

0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama's writing style is clear, articulate & very readable. But it is his interweaving of his past experiences, how they have shaped him as a person & how they guide his current thoughts, perspectives & goals that I found most interesting. Mr. Obama strikes me as an authentic, genuine person who we would be lucky to have in our political arena for decades to come. While I cringe that he may become less straightforward & honest being in politics, he is one of the few who I truly trust & the best hope for success that I see in our future. His values are right-on & I hope that he has many chances to steer the course of American history in the coming years.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|The best Chinese spaghetti western ever!  It's way offbeat, but it was really funny.  I never cease to be amazed at how the Chinese film industry balks at showing any kind of sexual interaction but doesn't flinch at showing a person taking a dump on the stoop of their flat.  Ah well.
020161622X|5.0|I picked up The Pragmatic Programmer because I was intrigued by the subtitle: \\"From Journeyman to Master.\\" As a non-professional programmer who has recently been writing more and more code in the context of my professional activities, I was eager to learn more about the \\"best practices\\" of the \\"master\\" programmers. Basically, I wanted to avoid becoming that stereotypical \\"VB guy\\" who simply slaps together some basic functionality and a nice-looking GUI and then signs off on the project without any serious testing or consideration of its maintainability.<br /><br />What I took away from this book was basically a philosophy of programming-a kind of professional ethic that transcends any particular language or methodology. From what I know about contemporary methods, it's evident that the authors belong to the agile camp. As a solitary developer, I'm probably not going to start writing unit tests and integration tests any time soon. However, I'm glad that I have a better understanding of why a professional developer would want to write tests before application code. The same applies to a number of the authors' other \\"tips.\\"<br /><br />I expect that this book has already helped many other untutored developers  transition from \\"programming by coincidence,\\" i.e. just hacking something together which happens to work (at least for the moment) to a more professional form of development.
B000B0QOJA|4.0|I personally like this tipe of jazz. I enjoy hearing endless variations that are accompanied by some kind of joy de vivre, when one almost feels the energy and music booming from speakers, moving your whole mind and body in the rhytm. After the song is over, you are often lost and it takes some time to regain ones composure. On the other hand, there are people who find this kind of music particularily nagging and painful. They are not willing to give any chance to artist or the song involved, and music just flows past them without touching them.<br /><br />But something bothers me with this record. It feels like Coltrane is somwhere else, although his instrument is still there and plying. For me, it's like hearing perfectly performed practice for fingering, perfect but still somehow rutinely done. There are flashes, where you can hear Coltrane snap into it, and music becomes more powerfull and gains colour, but this is over in such a short time that this feeling of non-existance remains. Like it has never been there.<br /><br />Bear in mind that this is the record which you will have to grow into. For which you will have to learn how to like it. It will go one piece at a time, but if you grasp the sense, then the full enjoyment will be prsent, and you'll return over and over again.
1401302378|3.0|This is a very interesting book in terms of its approach in explaining the \\"extension of the tail\\" caused by the abilities of aggregation, search, profiling, intelligent recommendations and almost unlimited reach provided to customers by a business model that finds synergies between the classical retail model and the virtual market place on the internet. <br /> <br />Typical characteristics and benefits of the extension of the tail are: <br /> <br />- Unlimited reach for the consumer as opposed to a limited choice in a physical retail store <br />- Powerful use of search engines that greatly reduces effort top locate the right products <br />- Intelligent and intuitive algorithms that profile customers  and recommend items that are very close to their needs thereby extending their choice beyond scarcity  <br />- Supply chain efficiencies resulting in lower cost to customer <br />- The above factors aid each other causing \\"long tailed distributions\\" leading to a progressive increase in the area under the tail at the cost of its head. <br /> <br />However, some key concepts related to e-commerce that led to this book are already published in earlier books. <br /> <br />\\"Blown to Bits: How the New Economics of Information Transforms Strategy\\" by Philip Evans, Thomas S. Wurster explains the concept of disintermediation\\" and the elimination of \\"tradeoff between richness and reach\\" thereby introducing a business model that threatens traditional brick and mortar shops. <br /> <br />\\"Now or Never: How Companies Must Change Today to Win the Battle for Internet Consumers\\" by Mary Modahl is another good book that explains the power of the internet in shifting of the virtual supply curve towards the actual supply curve (using the classical model) thereby ensuring higher supply at lower costs. Implications to businesses and customers and strategies are well discussed. <br /> <br />Another drawback of this book is that it focuses more on products like music that are downloadableor digitized. Not that it ignores the physical products or the services sector, but it fails to present a comprehensive business model. <br /> <br />In terms of marrying Business Process Excellence and Digitization of the internet technologies, I would recommend \\"How Digital Is Your Business?\\" by Adrian Slywotzky, David J. Morrison. Here their concept, dubbed \\"Digital Business Design,\\" is \\"not about technology for its own sake; it's about serving customers, creating unique value propositions, leveraging talent, radically improving productivity and increasing profits. It's about using digital options to craft a business model that is not only superior, but unique.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />This is not an exhaustive list of books on the topic but what I consider as those that have pioneered new business models that leverage on the internet to achieve quantum gains in competitive advantage and customer service. <br /> <br />\\"The Long Tail\\" is a tail ender at best.
0061015725|3.0|Michael Crichton's \\"Prey\\" is not your usual summer time reading fare. It's like a tossed salad of fact and fiction but you might not like all the ingredients. The language of some of the characters (e.g., \\"Charlie\\") can get vulgar with the swearing and cussing. If you are sensitive about this, you could probably skip over Charlie's comments without too much loss in the story! However, Michael Crichton creates a fictionialized story with current \\"hot\\" trends or topics such as Nanotechnology and the computer programming technique called \\"Genetic Programming.\\" So too, this story involves swarms of nanoparticles that coordinate their movements based on predetor/prey dynamics. This book (hardcover version) has references in the back of the book for further study about a subject matter that should be of concern for public discourse and debate related to Biotechnology and Bioethics. <br />  <br />
B000002GYR|5.0|We all are so human, and so alike in our vulnerablity. That is one of our more endearing qualities, to me. This album points that out so beautifully to me at every turn, in every way.<br /><br />Tom Waits is so extraordinary in his ordinariness. He is outstanding at delineating what makes a man a clown, a lover, someone you would fall for in a second. He is a romantic. A prince in bums clothing.<br /><br />I came late to Tom Waits--I am old, not quite as old as he is, but I didnt know about his music particularly early on. Is it possible I wasnt grown up enough to appreciate him until my forties? What kind of an idiot am I? He is spectacular.<br /><br />I adore this album.<br /><br />Every song sounds as if he is singing to you alone.<br /><br />Although many of the people who review ths album used to drink to it (boy do I understand! It has that feel, and of course the title song plays into that), I dont drink, so I COOK to it. I dont even cook my own meals to it...I cook for my husband and listen to the CD in the kitchen. Lambchops take around twice replaying my two favorite songs, the first two. I wish lambchops took longer. The whole album takes chicken breasts or something like that.<br /><br />I am reeling at the end of the album even if I am not drunk--intoxicated by the headiness of vintage Tom Waits.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|A Jamaican version of the Hype William's \\"Belly.\\"  A classic gangster movie and a must-see for all carribean people.  A little unrealistic at times, but it was still a gret movie.  Kymani Marley and Spragga Benz held their own with our great Paul Campbell (even though he played the rudest of rude bwoys).  Louie Rankin was equally entertaining.  My only disappointment was with the casting of Wyclef---he was horrible and irritating as usual. Without him, the movie would have been far more entertaining.
B000EYK4KI|3.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith is about as mainstream as mainstream action fare can get, and is more notable for being the first on-screen pairing of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie than it is for anything it offers film wise.  Pitt and Jolie star as an unhappily married couple who soon discover that each other are assassins working for rival organizations, and each one has the other set in their sights.  Yeah, you all pretty much know the premise by now, so there's no need to go any further in that department.  What really sets Mr. & Mrs. Smith apart from other mega budget fodder is the energetic and sometimes electrifying direction from Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity) and the heat and chemistry demonstrated by Pitt and Jolie, but there's really nothing else here to make it anything real special.  Also featuring the always scene stealing Vince Vaughan and Adam Brody.
B000060MMI|4.0|I heard the title track from this CD back in Fall of 2004, and instantly became a Celtic Rock fan.  I began a quest to find as much comparable and similar music as I could.  I will say that this is about where I draw the line in terms of how much \\"punk\\" style I can deal with in my Celtic Rock.  The vocals are a little harsh sounding, but the music is lively and enjoyable enough to make up for it.  For me it was a good place to start. If you like Irish-style music and can deal with a little hard rock, you will like this.
0307346609|5.0|I'd skimmed through Brooks' first book, \\"Zombie Survival Guide,\\" and found it mildly amusing -- the best part being the chapter on \\"zombie outbreaks throughout history.\\"  I really wasn't expecting much from WWZ, and only recently obtained a copy from the library based on a recommendation from a friend (otherwise, I probably wouldn't have bothered).<br /><br />This is one of the 10 Greatest Books of All Time (fiction).<br /><br />WWZ is \\"written\\" in the narrative style of famed journalist Studs Turkel, who would seek out individuals with interesting stories to tell, and ask a few brief questions while a tape recorder ran -- later transcribing the conversation word for word.  Brooks is brilliant to have utilized this technique in a fictional work.  Those reviewers complaining about WWZ being \\"just a bunch of short stories\\" or \\"a series of vignettes\\" need to become more well read.  Turkel's (non-fiction) works were all bestsellers, and are considered to be classics.<br /><br />True, a few of the stories seemed a bit silly, but nothing was completely unbelievable (once you can get past ZOMBIES being real!).  Many authors make a number of technical errors due to poor reasearch, laziness, and general incompetance.  While many readers (including agents and editors) might not notice such fanciful BS, an informed reader will.  Such a thing will jolt you out of the story (\\"That's wrong -- what an idiot!\\") and make the author lose credibility -- if it happens repeatedly, one simply doesn't read that author's books anymore, and refers to author as a \\"hack.\\"  I am happy to report that Brooks did not make such errors.  WWZ was meticulously researched.  Yes, I did find a few errors of fact, but they were so minor as to be of no consequence.  Very obscure and highly technical data is repeatedly alluded to throughout WWZ -- and nearly all of it checks out.  Either Brooks was writing about what he knows (subjects of deep personal interest), or he is an outstanding researcher . . . I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Fast pace, attention to detail, sympathetic characters, interesting facts, and the unique \\"narrative\\" technique really made WWZ stand out.  It had \\"the ring of truth\\" about it -- very easy to immerse yourself in the storyline.  I've read thousands of books (literally), and I can say that WWZ is the best thing I've read in years.<br /><br />Thank you, Max . . . but there's absolutely no way your book can be adapted for the screen, and I hope the upcoming film doesn't suck too bad.. .

B00005JOFQ|1.0|I couldn't agree more with Mary Wells' review. How are you supposed to get anything out of this movie if you can barely understand what the lead characters are saying? I guess I'll have to wait for the special \\"non-mumbling\\" DVD version to come out! <br /> <br />
B00008RH1H|5.0|\\"Throne of Blood\\" also known as (SPIDER WEBS CASTLE) is Kurosawa's attempt at Macbeth, only with a Japanese twist. This film is great and boasts a very strong and excellent supporting cast, including the legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune as the warrior Taketori Washizu in the lead. This is one of my favorite Kurosawa films. However it is the role of Lady Washizu (Isuzu Yamada) as the wife of Taketori which I found to be the most interesting character in the film.<br /><br />In this Kurosawa version of Macbeth, we find the story taking place in medieval Japan with the samurai as the main characters. Both (Toshiro Mifune) and (Minoru Chiaki) [a great and legendary actor himself] are rewarded for putting down a rebellion. For this they are rewarded by their overlord. However, they were previously warned in the forest by an old women that Mifune would rule, but his reign will be short-lived. This film is more of a Japanese film than a Shakespeare adaptation [which is good]. The film is definetly one of the greatest of Kurosawa's films and I recommend it highly. Everything about the film is great. [Stars: 5+]
B000H30B2C|4.0|This is a grand entertainment which represents the finest tribute to the original 1933 film KING KONG ever attempted by a long way.  It is a great ride on its own merits and a fine work of mainstream movie magic.<br /><br />It is hard to overstate the loving care apparent in the execution of this reimagining of the classic story, from individual effects shots to the performances of a quality cast anchored, perhaps surprisingly -- NOT by Jack Black who is arguably and finally without doubt miscast -- but by the mesmerizing, lovely, sexy, sweet, sincere and wholely seductive Naomi Watts.<br /><br />I do wholeheartedly recommend Peter Jackson's unreservedly ambitious, all-stops-out version of KING KONG, even though it entirely fails, with the exception of a moment or two with Miss Watts, to touch that part of my heart reserved for my lifelong love, the incomparable and virtually mystical movie production, the 1932-33 KING KONG.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|I have always liked the film \\"Kagemusha\\" ever since I watched it on the big screen. It is one of my favorite Kurosawa films. [And there are plently of his films I admire and have in my collection]. The films just an incredible watch, and I did not mind the length while viewing it in the theatre. Many have criticized that the film is too long, not so, it's terrific and every minute of the film is a treat to watch. The film is set in the 16th century, and centers on the Takeda clan, which was one of the three clans vying for control of Japan during the end of the feudal era.<br /><br />Lord Shingen, wonderfully portrayed by (Tatsuya Nakadi), whose credits include 'RAN', and 'SWORD OF DOOM' to name just two films, does a wonderful portrayal as both Lord Shingen, and his double in the film. When Lord Shingen is wounded in battle, he orders all those in his court to keep quiet about his impending death, and that a 'Kagemusha' [Shadow Warrior] take his place for three years in order to prevent the demise of his clan, and the other enemy forces seeking control over Japan from taking over. His double is of course played by (Tatsuya Nakadi).<br /><br />(Tatsuya Nakadai) is a petty criminal who is identical to the Lord Shingen. He was about to be executed, however, he is given a stay of execution as long as he does what he is told, and gives a performance of Lord Shingen, which everyone will accept. However, not everything goes as planned. The film is terrific, and the cinematography and set designs are incredible. This is not a fast action paced film, which many americans are used to, but a methodical and slow paced character study of the characters in the film. The nuances of the film are great, and as I wrote earlier, this is one of my favorite Kurosawa films, along with \\"Ikiru.\\" I highly recommend this magnificent masterpiece of cinema, it is a truly great film and a must see.

0671027344|3.0|Its been a while sence I've read this book, and my veiws on it have changed sence that first read 4 years ago. I'll start with the fact that this book is not really aimed at adults as far as i can see. Most book stores keep it in the \\"teen\\" section, and with good reason. The plot isnt so much lacking as it is meandering. The book is narated through the letters of the protagonist, and if youve ever read a letter from a 15 or 16 year old, ive found they wander and the point is not entirely clear. I also think the book has become a little dated, being set in the early 1990's, i can see how alot of the books referances might be lost on younger people(how many of today's 15 yearolds watch M*A*S*H* or know about Rocky Horor? let alone the significance of these things?) The book also apeals more to those who are somewhat outside of what is considered today's \\"mainstream\\" teen culture. Its not a long work either so dont expect to get alot out of it(I read pretty slowly and had it done in about a weekend) Baisicaly, the book good light reading for people who are looking for something along the lines of \\"The Outsiders\\" as far as storyline. its a comming of age story, and are there really any great coming of age stories that dont seem a little bit contrived?
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I wrote a review of this DVD about one year ago. However, when I was reviewing past reviews I had written, I was surprised to find that it never posted. Well, that's fine, because I have the newest DVD released by CRITERION, and WOW, it's everything [plus more] than I had ever hoped for. The film has been discussed at length here on amazon, and the reviews are incredibly great. This is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever produced. Akira Kurosawa made a classic masterpiece that will forever stand the test of time. The film is worth every penny I spent on it. CRITERION should be proud of this DVD, and if you have never seen the film, it's time you did. It is a great classic. And as I wrote, it is the granddaddy of ALL samurai films. There are some great samurai films out there, but this one is the ONE!<br /><br />As for the CRITERION release [lastest] it's fantastic. While I liked the older version, this latest upgrade far surprasses anything CRITERION has released thus far by Akira Kurosawa. If you have the older version, wait until you see the latest DVD release. So many reviewers have commented on this film, that I don't think there is anything more to add, except if you like this film, get this latest version, because you will not be disappointed. I have seen this film countless times, and everytime I watch it I see something new in it. Takashi Shimura has always been my favorite actor [especially after viewing \\"Ikiru\\" many years ago] and I find his role top-notch every time I view the film. Toshiro Mifune as always is standout in his performance--but everyone in the film [all seven samurai's] give something to the film that make this masterpiece eternal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|Boomers hold the Beatles in particular esteem because, unlike other groups, they grew musically over their careers and they grew as they listened.<br /><br />George Martin was called the \\"Fifth Beatle\\" for good reason. Knowledgeable of both classical and avant garde music, in the studio he added the finishing touches to music that would just be good Rock without him. A piccolo trumpet there, a complete orchestra, a string quartet, the bizarre music-concrete sounds of John Cage in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", recording the guitar backwards and all sorts of production stuff, sneaky things in the background of the soundstage, crickets, etc.  The Beatles would be merely spectacular without him, not one-of-a-kind, never to be duplicated. It is his ideas, his production that elevated wonderful music to the greatest ever recorded. Martin kept the group together after the death of their manager.<br /><br />This CD is a great effort, recasting familar music into new molds.  Martin and son have done a clever, cunning job redoing and remixing the orginal tapes and adding stuff. The highlighs of this effort are \\"Within You and Without you/Tommorow Never Knows\\", the acappella \\"Because\\" & \\"Lucy in the Sky\\". Starts with one song and unexpectedly transforms into a compeletly different one. (The Beatles often played in the same key, that's why this merge is possible, no songs in B flat minor, F double sharp!)<br /><br />Many people have discussed the quality of the songs, I won't go further. I will discuss the sonic qualities.  The biggest difference is that most songs are far more DYNAMIC than either the original LP or CD versions (I have both). Some have much deeper bass along with the improved dynamics. Many songs (\\"Because\\") are rolled off in the highs, the last two to three octaves  removed from the original. All of this shows me that George Martin and Apple could re-do the whole Beatle catalog with much improved sonics, if they wished. A really improved SACD version would be possible! A quality stereo will show what Martin has done. Low fidelity listeners: IPod, Xm, Mp3 and those who listen over their computers are less likely to.<br /><br />A triumph, highly recommended.be possible!

B000IOM1RI|4.0|If you go into this expecting either an actual album or a masterpiece then of course you won't like it that much. If you go in expecting a good time with good music then you will love it. Jaybles and KG really bring it with this soundtrack, one of the better ones I have ever heard. Of course the best song is \\"Kickapoo\\", Meatloaf and Dio really make that song. JB plays a backseat to their awesome vocals. As much of a joke as their first album was, the majority of these songs are even jokier. Even with the jokes, some songs have a sincerity that only a true song can have. \\"Baby\\" really surprised me and it is quite a beautiful song. Songcraftmanship is always at a forefront, mostly because they can write catchy songs with great instrumentation. It's a good CD, not great but definitely better than OK.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|\\"Miracle On 34th Street\\", written by Valentine Davies and George Seaton; directed by George Seaton. (Spoilers abound, because I can't imagine that anyone who can read this hasn't seen this film yet).<br /><br />It's the classic story of kindly Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), a Macy's store Santa who firmly believes that he really is Santa Claus. Hard-bitten Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her level-headed daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) don't buy it for a second. But is he telling the truth?<br /><br />As long as there's been Christmas (and Christmas movies), filmmakers have struggled to capture that feeling many of us associate with the season. Like many other subject matter, Christmas is a high-wire act, and audiences are more often than not subjected to a dunking in treacle. What is it, then, that makes this film so effective? Why has this story thrived for almost sixty years, surpassing the inevitable remake and imitations with nary a blemish?<br /><br />The obvious answers are true: it's extremely well written, directed and performed. Everyone in the film is tremendous, and naturally Gwenn and Wood are the standouts. It's impossible to imagine anyone being a more convincing Santa than Mr. Gwenn, and young miss Wood's acting is expressive and touching. It's a real challenge to make literal-mindedness and pragmatism appealing, and her success seems effortless.<br /><br />Like many great movies, every choice feels as if there were no other option. Imagine setting this at a store in the midwest. The writer easily could have done so, but by setting it in New York City, the iconic heart of tough-minded me-first cynicism, the sentimentality has fertile ground in which to bloom.<br /><br />That's reflected in the script again and again with a salty, grounded edge to amost every character decision. Parade manager Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) doesn't simply choose Kris because he's kind-hearted and a dead ringer for Santa - she grabs him off the street in desperation because the Santa that she hired is passed-out drunk. It's also echoed in the skepticism of almost everyone that Kris comes across. Everyone likes him, but they're pretty sure he's a bit of a nut. Kris is so good in the parade, though, that he's quickly hired as the flagship Claus for the store.<br /><br />Things are allowed to continue as they are - Kris 'plays' Santa at Macy's - with no one needing to seriously question his identity. Business is booming, and as long as Kris isn't seen to be a danger to anyone, his 'eccentricity' gets a pass. Even a huge potential misstep - Kris begins to recommend products from competing stores to customers - transforms into a goodwill epidemic among the retail chains. Naturally, this balance doesn't last long.<br /><br />Kris make a friend with Alfred, a young janitor who loves playing Santa for the kids, too - but both he and Kris fall victim to the Macy's employee screener, Granville Sawyer (Porter Hall). Literal-minded to a fault, Mr. Sawyer believes that Kris is deranged, and will cause harm if his delusion is threatened. But the straw that breaks the reindeer's back is when Sawyer begins to psychoanalyze Alfred, convincing him that his love of being Santa is the result of a guilt complex in his childhood. This infuriates Kris to such a degree that he clonks the would-be Freud on the head with his cane - and that's all the ammunition that Sawyer needs.<br /><br />He sets in motion commitment proceedings, an action even the hard-boiled Macy doesn't want to take. But it's too late. Fortunately, Santa has a lawyer - Fred Gailey (John Payne), who lives near Doris. While both Fred and Kris have ulterior motives concerning Doris and Susan - Fred wants to get to know Doris better, Kris wants to introduce Susan to imagination and faith - the script does the tricky job of keeping our sympathy.<br /><br />Another great choice is to make Kris' first (literal) defender an adult - another stong contrast to the watery-eyed moppet who believes,believes, believes from the first frame to the last. Additionally, Doris and Susan are the last to make that emotional shift.<br /><br />The stakes are high, too - Kris isn't simply going to be fired and sent packing out into the snow. If this case is lost, he'll be committed to Bellview asylum for good. We get a little taste of how broken and unhappy he'd be when Kris weakens and deliberately fails the psychiatric exam, effectively committing himself. His faith in his fellow man is shattered, but fortunately lawyer Fred Gailey (John Payne) convinces him to keep fighting - deftly setting up the courtroom sequence.<br /><br />Fred take the best path a lawyer could use - he pressures the prosecutor to prove that Kris isn't Santa. No one wants to say there's no Santa on the stand, for a variety of savvy, unsentimental reasons. The prosecutor doesn't want to crush his son's dreams of Christmas.

Additionally, Doris and Susan are the last to make that emotional shift. <br /> <br />The stakes are high, too - Kris isn't simply going to be fired and sent packing out into the snow. If this case is lost, he'll be committed to Bellview asylum for good. We get a little taste of how broken and unhappy he'd be when Kris weakens and deliberately fails the psychiatric exam, effectively committing himself. His faith in his fellow man is shattered, but fortunately lawyer Fred Gailey (John Payne) convinces him to keep fighting - deftly setting up the courtroom sequence. <br /> <br />Fred take the best path a lawyer could use - he pressures the prosecutor to prove that Kris isn't Santa.

B000J4OYRW|5.0|Just to settle the discussion on this item, I know someone who got this and it is NTSC and Region 0 and not a bootleg.  Unfortunately some of these were mispressed without the Flamboyant video.  The credits on the case don't show the Flamboyant video but it is included on the HK or Hong Kong version.  Unfortunately when I ordered this version from Amazon they did not send it to me.  They sent me the non-HK version that does not have the Flamboyant video (which is great!) so when you order this make sure that Amazon sends the right one.  I am sending mine back for a replacement.  The picture of the case is misleading.  The HK version does come in a standard US-type DVD case, not a CD case as the cropped picture leads you to believe.    12-14-06 Update:  The replacement came and it IS the Hong Kong version however, I have found out that not all Hong Kong discs have the Flamboyant video.  The only way to tell is to look at the disc itself and if the code of numbers on the inner rim ends in @1 then it has the video, if it ends in @2 then it does not have Flamboyant.  Unfortunately my 2nd copy doesn't have the video and I am sending it back to Amazon as defective and they have been very kind about it.  I am asking for a refund and will attempt to get the right copy on ebay as Amazon cannot open an item to check the code for me.  Good luck!
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I bought this CD without listening to a single song first because I loved the last one so much. Boy was I dissapointed! Aside from a catchy opening track the rest of the CD left me bored. Don't get me wrong, this isn't bad CD, its just not a good one. Nothing overtly original, to me it sound likes songs that were rejected from the pussycat dolls CD. I dont know what happened between this new CD and the last one, but I think Gwen needs to go back to those old producers, or just take more time making a great album instead of rushing one out.<br /><br />Just my opinion
B000BRBA8S|4.0|I too had some problems finishing 2046 like the reviewer below me but I was glad to push myself through the end. I may know why some people may have a problem with this film and it's because this film is the third release of the Wong Kar-Wai trilogy. Days of Being Wild and In the Mood for Love are the first two films and from the little bit of In the Mood For Love I got to see 2046 is in the same style though it is said that 2046 is a lose sequel. The first two films may have things that need to be know before anyone can watch this one.  I believe the first time trying to watch 2046 many may have a problem finishing it but after a little break and processing everything going on in it you'll come to greatly appreciate it. Not only will people respect it for it's beautiful backgrounds and vibrant colors but for it's well thought out story and characters.<br /><br />2046 is the number of the hotel room in In The Mood For Love and it is the same in this film but Chow played by Tony leung does not stay in the room. The room now belongs to a few of the women he likes to keep close among other things. Chow is the same character that he was in In The Mood For Love, he is a journalist documenting a war but he starts writing the story 2046. His story is where the science fiction comes in, it's about a train that goes to a place named 2046 and it's filled with androids and stuff. I think this was a problem because the first time you see the film it goes right into Chow's fictional story and it never lets you know. So if your not paying full attention you'll lose the story and begin to think that Zhang Ziyi is really an android.<br /><br />Americans may also find a problem with the fast subtitles, which will take more attention. There aren't many flaws in 2046 but I would recommend to anyone thinking about watching this film to watch the first two films first. I love the picture the most in 2046 and the slick words that are exchanged between Leung and his leading ladies. The film shows Leung as sort of a womanizer but at the same time it give the females power as well but I do like the little story that occurs between he and Ziyi's characters. The acting is great and story as well and I can't wait to rewind and watch the rest of the first two films.The film shows Leung as sort of a womanizer but at the same time it give the females power as well but I do like the little story that occurs between he and Ziyi's characters.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|Harnessing the talent that they have always had yet never fully controled, Muse has taken a giant leap beyond what Black Holes could have been (Absolution Part 2) and created a sound that rock legends would be proud to call their own and belongs uniquely to the trio from Teignmouth. In every track singer/songwriter Bellamy displays his increasing mastery over his falsetto voice in both ending the harsh tones of his earliest years and displaying a range that walks from the highest, most energetic pitches to the lower, more solid part of the register. To compliment his increased vocal talent Bellamy's writing has not only crafted a new world for the listener to explore, but one that has its roots firmly planted in our own. Bassist Wolstenholm and Drummer Howard demonstrate their own learned lessons and apply them effectively to round out a three-piece that plays with more sound than most five-pieces. Built upon are the base lines that made listeners tune into Absolution so that now they bend into everything from hard-rock power lines to tech-disco-stomp foundations. The percussion has found its full meaning on this album with Howard pressing the beat and operating as a real entity instead of just a fill between phrases. <br /> <br />To be honest, Black Holes and Revelations is a tough listen if one approaches looking for Absolution B-sides. But past that, this fourth effort from Muse is straight money. <br /> <br />Recommended: Starlight, Map of the Problematique, City of Delusion
0679720200|5.0|When it became known that President Bush recently read the Stranger, one comedian remarked that he was happy that the president was finally completing his ninth grade reading list. Like many students, I read this book in high school, enjoyed it, and then decided to read it again as I had forgetten much of the plot. The book remains of interest too me still many years after reading it in high school. As is well known, existential themes such as choices and their consequences, and individual subjectivity are quite prominent, yet the novel is more than simply a philospophical treatise. It flows easily and is quite short but the reader can spend a great deal of time considering the questions raised by the stranger. The story's protagonist, Mersault, is a young Algerian very detached both from his personal emotions and from the traditional values one expects in society. One does however feel that there is a certain sincerity to many of his actions. There is no outward show or pretense, he says and does what he feels.  The book begins as he attends his mother's funeral and behaves somewhat indifferently. He cared for her, but they had little in common and he doesn't consider showing any grief that he doesn't truly feel. He then forms an attachment to a young woman who loves him. He says he will marry her if that is what she wants, but again he behaves very ambivalently. In the second half of the novel, Mersault, through a chain of unlikely and unfortunate circumstances commits a crime. The plot then focuses on his trial and societies' outrage not only at his crime, but for the untraditional behaviour he exhibited in the novel's beginning. He is portrayed as an uncaring and unfeeling monster by the lawyers. The reader believes that this is too harsh a judgement, but then how can he be characterized? I think that this is the question that makes this a very rich novel whether you are a high school student, or president Bush
B000J4QWMC|2.0|Let me say at once that I think Michael Mann is unquestionably one of the best directors the U.S. has produced, and Farrell and Foxx are both major talents.  Indeed, \\"Heat\\", \\"Collateral\\", and \\"Intermission\\" are among my favorite films.  Having said all that, I have to tell you this one is a mess. <br /> <br />  Several other reviewers have argued that those who came away from this film disappointed somehow just \\"don't get it.\\"  Sorry, but this isn't a Bergman or Fellini arthouse flick.  It is a new-noir crime drama, and one of the defining characteristics of noir is a certain realism, a grounding in reality.  And having been a vice officer for nearly thirteen years, I gotta tell ya, this isn't even close <br /> <br />  Nor am I bemoaning the differences between the film and the TV series. I'm talking about the fact that I did not, for even a single second, think I was watching actual vice cops in action. Instead \\"Miami Vice\\" chronicles the antics of over-coiffed models who were pretending to be vice cops. <br /> <br />  I'm not talking about the flashy cars and clothes, or the apparently unlimited supply of funds given the detectives to maintain their covers.  I'm talking about the absolutely idiotic way they go about their duty of identifying a leak within their own ranks and bringing down the drug lord who pays the leak.   <br /> <br />  The way Crockett and Tubbs run their case wouldn't catch a pair of sixteen-year-old Overton thrill-seekers robbing gas stations.  Mr. Mann wastes the time he could have used in showing the detectives' skills as investigators (or undercover operators) on showing them showering, and glowering, and showering, and rolling about in bed, and....showering again.  <br /> <br />  And the few scenes of actual police work are nearly farcical, like the scene in which Det. Crockett snaps the neck of a suspect in a trailer park.  Having been involved in my fair share of \\"use-of-force\\" incidents I can tell you any cop who did that would be well advised to shoot himself before Internal Affairs arrived on scene, because by the time a grand jury got done with him he'd be dead anyway.  And in the climactic gunfight, both Crockett and Tubbs repeatedly cross the fire lines of their back-up team, which is an excellent way to get shot by your own people.  This is such a basic mistake that any decent FTO would have trained it out of a real cop in their first week on the street. <br /> <br />  Nor are the gaping logic holes confined to the main heroes.  For instance the white supremacist trailer trash who are trading guns and dope with the drug lord, but kidnap and murder some relative or associate of every person they deal with.  Folks, selling dope and sex are like a legitimate business in one sense: if you get a rep for being a rip-off artist you stop getting business.  Nobody in the criminal world, especially at the high level \\"Miami Vice\\" is supposed to be confronting, would deal with psychos like those even once, no matter what they were selling. <br /> <br />  If you've already seen this film and enjoyed it, more power to you; I truly wish I could say the same, for I love Mr. Mann's other work My advice is, if you really want to see what working murder and drugs are like, watch HBO's \\"The Wire\\".  If you want a dose of Mann, get \\"Heat\\", \\"Collateral\\", or \\"Thief\\".  If you haven't seen \\"Miami Vice\\" yet, rent before you buy.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink is simply the best. Each of her cd's is better than the last and everyone one is good. She's the only singer out there who consistantly has top quality songs on every cd she makes. Unlike so many \\"great\\" singers or groups, she always has tons of songs that resonate with you, not just 2 or three. From her soulfull voice, her lyrics which are actually about things, to the intsrumentals, rythm and beat of her songs, she puts all other female singers to shame. In my opion she is not just the best female singer in the world, but the best musician going on period. It's a shame I'm Not Dead recieved so little recognition or acclaim and that Stupid Girls, the only song that really broke though, was not even close to the best on here. Listen to tunes like 'Long Way To Happy', 'Cuz I Can', 'I'm Not Dead', 'Runaway'. Wow, unreal and awesome stuff. You will absolutly love this cd. Thanks, Pink.
B000J10ERO|3.0|I went to see Superman Returns with high hopes, especially with the much improved special effects from the previous movies.  Unfortunately, that is what this movie centered around - the special effects. I lost all connection with the characters... Lois and Clark - unrequited love - what? They have basically one scene in the entire movie where you start to connect with the characters and their dilemmas, but it is shortly followed by an intense action scene, leading up to the ultimate finale.  <br /> <br />The special effects carried this movie, stunning my eyes with their realism.  I loved the movie while I was watching it, but afterwards it only left a bitter taste in my mouth - a tasteless blend of storyless droll with an overly pronounced dash of special effects. I am sure my opinion will be a less than popular one, but, I guess, it is just because my hopes for this movie were unexpectedly trampled upon.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Gwen Stefani wears her 80's influences on her sleeves which is cool at times,but then it becomes one big cliche. that is the problem with this album which is basically the cutting room floor material that wasn't good enough to make it on her debut album. I wasn't that fond of her debut album&this album is a set below that one. vocally she sounds like she is trying to channel 80's era Madonna, Cyndi Lauper,Deborah Harry with mixed results. the Production is a dime a dozen&the songwriting is just bland. Gwen needs to go back to No doubt like Yesterday.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Michael Mann gave it a good try, attempting to turn a TV series into a condenced movie version, but It just can't be done...unless they are planning sequels.  Yes, he did a great job in some of his other action films, thinking specifically of  Heat, but this is more of a Luke Warm.  The movie just lanches into Crockett and Tubbs under cover, and they reapidly progress into deep cover. But the movie had no sense of timeline, so it just seemed like it took place over a few days.  And, this movie is 130+ minutes long, and honestly i still don't see they filled this amount of time.  And the love scenes, just not nessessary, Actually detracted from the movie in my book. At the end, its the predictable drug scene gone bad, wife kidnapped and injured critically, and, of course, one of the heros, in this case Sonny, has fallen in love with a girl that he can't have...at least for now.  Anyway, this movie is a rent before buying, and make the judgement for yourself.  I guess if I was a bigger fan of the TV show, it might be pretty close to the same thing, but I always thought the TV show was kinda borish as well, except for the cool intro and theme song.
B000J103YI|3.0|i enjoy the Porduction&the pacing of this Album&Look forward to the Movie. Eddie Murphy actually ain't bad. his voice works well with the material he is doing,but Jennifer Hudson is the real Star vocally on this project. She can Sing/Sang. she should be getting top billing as far as I'm concearned.  Beyonce is just ok. she oversings a bit&doesn't leave that kind of feeling on a song the way that Jennifer Hudson does. still this is a Pretty Good soundtrack&the Movie should be a smash Hit.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|With the first pull of \\"Be Here Now,\\" I fell over my sofa with relief. Bought blindly--based on reading reviews, a strong positive prejudice towards the name \\"Ray\\", and a satisfying tarot card reading--I held my breath every time a new track started, waiting for the slowly spreading feeling of contentment (not often sustainable through a whole CD and even more rarely discovered upon the first listen) to spring a leak at the hands of an odd or misplaced track and lessen slightly and cause me to mumble to no one in particular with a tone mixing disappointment with sad relief: \\"Ah well, it's probably for the best. Every album needs at least one misstep, right? I mean, if the whole thing were perfect...that'd be boring...right? No one wants to be bored...\\" [commence silent weeping].  <br /> <br />Instead of mumbling to myself. I smiled. Grinned, actually, the whole length of the album. <br /> <br />Like a hot iron pressing a pair of pants, this album presses away turbulence, leaving a smooth,crisp wake from crotch to hem.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|When listening to this record, all people want to do is complain that it isn't like No Doubt's albums. That's the point. If it was going to sound like a No Doubt album, it would be one. This album is fantastic. <br /> <br />Her creativity is meant to be taken seriously, the songs are not, necessarily. She set out to make another mindless dance record. I think she is even underestimating herself. It's not mindless, it's just fun. <br /> <br />If you want to hear the same tired, reused beats and formulaic pop songs, go turn on the radio. To borrow from Sagat, you'll hear the same five songs, 15 times a day, for three months. <br /> <br />Stefani does explore hip hop, with songs like \\"Orange County Girl,\\" \\"Now that You Got It,\\" and \\"Yummy.\\" No, they aren't conventional and no, these aren't her strongest songs, but she takes a risk to blend cultures and genres. Above all, she's having fun and blending together sounds that other hip hop artists shy away from for fear of stepping too far outside the box. <br /> <br />Other songs, such as \\"Wonderful Life,\\" \\"U Started It,\\" \\"Early Winter,\\" \\"Flourescent,\\" and \\"4 in the Morning,\\" show Gwen at her best. Light, airy, dreamy ballads with mature lyrics that weren't found on L.A.M.B. <br /> <br />Praise an artist for not conforming, don't condemn her being a white 37-year old female trying to rap. She holds her own and then some.
B000G759LW|4.0|Christina is going old school with this CD and boy does it work. The first CD is more modern songs, my favorite being still dirrty and back in the day, but the SECOND disc is awesome. The whole second disc is worth the price of the CD. Candyman,  Hurt (new single), Nasty naughty boy are among my favorites. If the CD was cut to one disc i think it would have been much better. I tend to skip most of the first disc. I am normally not one to argue about more material being on a disc, but there is just too much on these two discs. Still, this is a must have for anyone, who  likes christina or wants to go more old school in their music or likes the older style of music.
1582701709|5.0|Some of the reviews here seem to point to the movie and not the book, but what I believe many are saying is you really can't have on without the other.  The book gives you many more details and expounds on SOME ways of pllacing thoughts in your heart to create your universe, but when you add the dvd and, as R. Gangi says, add the other books too, you end up with a workable plan to change your life and attract what you desire. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />E.

B000J103YI|5.0|I remember Jennifer from American idol and i thought she was good, but would never do anything once she was off and look at her now! She shines in this soundtrack. I still like Jennifer Holliday better, but Jennifer holds her own. This is a star studded soundtrack with beyonce, jamie foxx, eddie murphy and of course Jennifer Hudson. The songs are catchy and likable. For all of your who don't know, this movie is slightly based on the Supremes. The whole cast shines, Eddie murphy is better than i expected in this role. Even if you don't like musicals, you should give this a try, i think you will be surprised. I can't wait for the movie.

0743289412|2.0|I am a HUG Stephen king fan....I have read every novel at least once, and several 2 or 3 times...I read the Dark Tower series from book one to book 7 straight thru twice. The only book of his I have ever less than enjoyed was The Tommyknockers, which I felt was bland. So, suffice to say, I was psyched by the release of Lisey's Story. Wrongly so. One of what I feel to be Steve's greatest traits as a writer is his creation of character. They become very real to me, almost like old friends and new strangers. They take life in my mind, living and breathing there even when I am not in the book. Not so Lisey Debusher. She is a vapid, boring character. I call her character, not person, because character is all the life she has earned. The stroy is ok, and I have found myself enticed at times, but all in all a very dull book. If Lisey was a bit more alive, maybe this book would work. Unfortunately, for me at least, it does not. Maybe we constant readers will have better luck with Blaze.
B00005JNS0|2.0|Cars is a fun filled film that is enjoyable for the whole family. Cars is about a race car, Lightning McQueen, that seeks fame and happiness in in all the wrong places. He thinks true happiness is in fame, fortune, and fine oil. He later realizes that happiness is not found in those things but through friendships and the cars he cares about most. The authors very well got their point across. True happiness is found when you please those around you. This film is full of humor, heartwarming events, and is enjoyable for the whole family.
B000089RV6|5.0|Obviously, the person who wrote the review below me knows absolutely jack squat about music... apparently Led Zeppelin, Queen, Pink Floyd and AC/DC must pale in comparison to his bands... I bet he thinks The Who and The Beatles suck too.<br /><br />Long story short, for anyone out there that appreciates music at all, you must buy this album.  Music these days is so overproduced and overpitched to kids that it's almost a crime against humanity.  From the moment this album starts to the final chord it's all classic rock and roll.  \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" is probably one of the greatest songs ever made.  Blast it in your car and drive down an interstate... you'll probably get a speeding ticket, but it's worth it.  Keep on rocking.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|a powerful, driving, consistently stunning album that continually pleases. This band has more energy and excitement than tons of others combined. Remember the first great punk show you ever saw, or the mind expanding stage presence of one of the greats the first time you saw him -think Bowie, Ferry, Butler. This is the band to keep your eyes and your ears on. They explode with talent and endure like few others. To catch their live experience is truly a night to remember. I am blown away by this stuff.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is one of the most important films ever to be made. It explains our environmental problems better than anything I have seen. Because it tells it as it is, in layman's terms. It is not a political statement. Everyone has everything to gain.  <br /> <br />It is shocking that as a human race we could be killing our children's and our grandchildren's future by our complacency and apathy. Yes, sometimes we are just too comfortable to see the obvious. And we need to wake everyone up. <br /> <br />There are many things we can do, and one of them is to educate ourselves and everyone we know. Everyone is in this together. We all share this planet together. And if we have a problem, we should learn how to fix it together. Buy many copies of this film and give them out to everyone who is special in your life. And think about giving one to a stranger. Tell them to spread the word. Maybe, just maybe we can truly come together as a human race and do something that is truly significant for life on earth. Save it.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is my favorite film adaptation of the Christmas Carol. I owned the VHS version for years and wore it out with multiple viewings every Christmas. I always felt the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" was contrived and completely out of place in the film, I even went so far as to play director and told my wife exactly where I thought that scene should be cut. When I found out this version of the DVD was being released, in Widescreen and without that stupid song, I was elated. <br /> <br />IMHO this version of the movie is PERFECT!
B000AYEL1A|2.0|I remembered really liking this film many years ago, so I bought it.  But it was so dated, I couldn't wait 'till it was over.  Also I think some of the scenes were added or changed. At least, that's the way I remembered it.  The music was awful, especially the Kris Kristoferson music, if you could call it that.  Most of the time he was too drunk to sing.  And the tales of his down hill collapse was nothng short of boring.   Barbra's songs were fair.  Evergreen is still remembered as a nice ballad, and Barbra did sing one OK rock tune.  But most of her stuff was also boring.   The two stars instead on one is for the song Evergreen, not the film.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|Before I start my review I just want to advise people that they should buy the other version of this cd and not this one. The other one is currently cheaper and contains an extra 3rd cd. When I bought this it was my 63rd George Michael cd, so I am a bit of a fan. This cd contains all the relevant hits of his career & is an excellent buy. I would also recommend all of his cd's because it's my opinion that he has only written one bad song in his life, \\"A Moment With You\\" (I'm guessing he wrote this bad one on purpose to spite Sony). My favorites on this cd are \\"Everything She Wants\\" and \\"An Easier Affair\\",\\"Heal the Pain\\" is also a great duet. I think the DVD companion to this cd is coming out soon. I am looking forward to finally seeing the expensive \\"Freeek!\\" video for the first time. You should buy this cd because holding a new George Michael product is like witnessing a titan arum plant in bloom (without the stink), it just doesn't happen very often. I want to thank [...] for making George Michael import cd's available to Americans. I think George has forgotten us. I would like to let you all know that I would give this cd 6 stars if I could. So buy & enjoy!
B000HEWEEY|4.0|I'd seen this movie on TV a few times over the years and always meant to get myself a copy. The story does have it's plot holes but is still one of the best scifi movies out there, even if it is 50 years old now. Most of the movie actually makes sense! In one scene there's a hologram of Morbius' daughter Alta- it wasn't called a hologram (and wasn't due to be invented for years yet) but that's just a small example of the vision they had in creating this thing. Almost the only appearance complaint even after all this time is the look of some of the outdoors shots and a few of the Krell equipment scenes (in those days it was all handwork and models, no computer effects, so it all looks very well indeed).Any collection of science fiction ought to have it, maybe any film collection period. <br /> <br />The Ultimate Collector's Edition came out recently so I decided to get that. The movie is supposed to have been remastered, the sound is great but I thought I saw a little color shifting sometimes, like the color adjustments weren't perfectly even. I didn't like \\"The Invisible Boy\\" very much (I think I saw part of it on TV years ago)- kind of a 12 year olds plotline, the Thin Man TV appearance of the Robot was more interesting. Forbidden Planet itself is the only thing on either disc that is captioned or subtitled- would've been nice to have that on some of the extra's.  <br /> <br />It was interesting to see how many of the cast/crew are still living- including the robot creator and the wife of the husband/wife sound FX team. Some of the deleted scenes and lost footage (most of this was just test shots) looked very interesting but none of that stuff was restored- some of it looked like it was a worn video of a worn piece of film it was so fuzzy or scratchy. <br />
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen Stefani's first solo CD, love.angel.music.baby. was not without its flaws, but had a innovative quality to it.  After Hollaback Girl, many songs are labeled by reviewers as: 'hollaback girl-ish\\".  Most of that CD was good and was something that we have not heard yet.  This time around its not exactly magic.  The Sweet Escape doesn't have any songs that are bad, but none that will make you go running to the dance floor such as what you waiting for? or any that are smooth and soothing like luxurious.  Yummy is just a generic dance song that will get lost in the beat heavy shuffle of Fergie, Ciara and co.  She goes for a mid-tempo pop/electronic sound this time.  Most songs are they type that you can just sit and listen too.  Like her first CD, this one has a campy, gimmicky, quirky quality, but unlike the first it lacks any standout tracks or originality.  In Yummy Gwen sings that 'she will never go solo' and she will 'release only one more', which is this. I like her solo but it might be a good thing to go back to No Doubt if her material is like this from now on.  The stand out tracks are:  none they are all listenable but not really download worthy.
B0000UJL96|5.0|\\"Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country\\" is my favorite ST film.  Although I've only recently started watching the original series on G4 and TV Land, I've always had more of an attachment to the original crew than any of the others.  Since watching the old series, I've grown to love the original crew even more.  In \\"The Undiscovered Country,\\" our heroes find themselves on the edge of a brand new world in which the Klingons actually want (or for protection's sake, need) peace.  Naturally, Captain Kirk wants nothing to do with the Klingons on this matter.  However, Spock has \\"volunteered\\" the Enterprise to be the escort for the Klingon party to the new peace talks.  Things go wrong when the Chancellor Gorkon, the primary Klingon representative, is murdered on his own ship and it was seemingly done at the hand of the Enterprise.  What follows is a Klingon trial for Kirk and Bones, imprisonment on a Klingon penal mine planet, and Spock and the rest of the gang trying to uncover what's really going on.  It's a wonderful space mystery that I enjoy every time I see it.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it's a nice edition to anyone's collection.  It's full of nice documentaries ranging from a tribute to DeForest Kelley to a neat little segment known as \\"Penny's Toybox\\" in which we get to take a look at some of the props used in the film.  It was refreshing to see that not one of these documentaries (over three hours worth) included the typical self-serving bits as many DVDs include.  Ironically, this particular film could actually get away with documentaries where the crew pats themselves on the back, because this is one of the best \\"Trek\\" flicks ever.<br /><br />A wonderful send off to a wonderful space opera.  Highly recommended.
B000J103YI|5.0|I usually dont care for musicals or soundtracks, especially before ive seen a movie but this time i have to say i loved this music.  The movie should be amazing if it is anything like this soundtrack.<br /><br />the key tracks are:<br />Listen by Beyonce, One Night Only (disco version) by the Dreams, and I Meant You No Harm/Jimmy's Rap by Eddie Murphy
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Here's the Truth: Bob Dylan is a man. Bob Dylan (born Zimmerman) is a musician. He plays music. <br /> <br />You want to hear someone play from the heart? Listen to this. And connect with him - i.e. hear him. <br /> <br />You want spiritual guidance? Read your Bible fools. That's what this guy says sometimes, along with the many other realities of where we all are. <br /> <br />The last track, Sugar Baby... good, from the heart good. <br />
B000JJRIN4|3.0|When I first listened to L.A.M.B. I was completely mesmerized.  I fell in love with its unique funky vibe.  However, GE is lacking in substance.  After my first listen I'm left with a big Hmmmm??  I'm hoping that after a few more listens it will catch on.  Most of the tracks are okay, but nothing that stands out.  I have a good ear for music and usually know from the first listen if it's going to be heavy rotation in my cd player - I'm not feel'en it though.  We'll see.  I'll keep ya'll posted.  I'll be back after a few more listens with an update.....  & yes....I do miss \\"No Doubt\\".  UPDATE:  Okay, after a 2nd listen I like it slightly better, but still not impressed.  WHY ARE SOME OF YOU CALLING THIS R&B?  This is far from R&B.  There are a few tracks that have an R&B vibe, but in it's entirety it's more of a pop/punk/disco 80's type of vibe.  Being the same age as GS, the 80's vibe is my guilty pleasure.  I appreciate all genres & era's of music in a variety of genres including pop, rock, r&b, contemporary country, classic rock, alternative, easy listening, classical, etc.  My reaction to Sweet Escape is way different from my initial reaction to L.A.M.B, which I loved from the first listen.  Even though this cd is within the realm of my musical interests, much of the music/production sounds rushed and simplistic.  There is no depth or structure.  It's not a cd I will throw in the garbage, but Gwen certianly will not be sharing a spot with Christina's \\"Back to Basics\\" CD, which is now a permanent fixture in my cd player at home and in my car.  I haven't written her off, but I will admit that this CD could have been better.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|This album is not horrible as I've seen many blast it as... but it isn't as \\"superb\\" as others have declared either. This is purely an average effort... with spikes in both good and bad directions. For one, the rap-talking style that seems to be becomming a popular pop staple is starting to wear out its welcome and listening to Gwen do it on nearly every other song doesn't do this \\"movement\\" any favors. That said, her lyrics are quite creative and even on songs that seem to mimic other songs out there... (Yummy sounds similar to Milkshake by Kelis) she seems to be a little ahead of the game verse wise. Paricularly cleaver is her break up song that is set up as if it is a cell-phone dropped call ad. What is different this time around from her last album is the fact that beatwise she is all over the place... and with an array of well known producers, it is easy to say why. She proves that she is an ecclectic performer and while that could be good in many cases it seems to also  weigh her down a bit. No one can deny that she is a good performer... but her waffer thin voice seems to not do much for some of the songs on this collection and to be perfectly honest, when she rap talks the songs seem a little flat. Toss in some songs that are just blah and this album is saddly peppered with mediocrity. Still, there are some gems amoung the average tid bits. \\"Early Winter\\" is a slight throw back to No Doubt and it shows that she still has a sensible approach to music in addition to her adventurous approach. \\"U Started It\\" is fresh and poppy... although it sounds a little like another song from her previous album as well. A glaring misstep falls onto the \\"Orange county Girl\\" which finds Gwen attempting to be like \\"everyone else\\" but not really comming off scincere about it. I am not disapointed that I bought this CD... as there are good songs... and even when at her most average she is much more entertaining than some of the other generic artists out there. If she does anotheralbum, I hope she sticks more to songs similar to \\"Early Winter\\" and interjects more vocal prowess as opposed to that talk thing which is not a very good way to display ones true talent.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Yes, the movie has those lessons, but, as the Door Guards say, \\"That's only half of it.\\" This is quite strange, actually, but there exist certain works of literature and cinema, certain paintings also that happen, by accident or not, to approach very nearly some fundamental truths. Unrelated to each other, with the authors usually unaware what comes out as side effect, they stretch in a kind of string across the ages. The ancient Babylon had them, and medieval England, and England of Queen Victoria, and, hard as it is to believe in this desperate age, the United States in 1980s.  <br /> <br />I will not give examples: you, reading this, either already know what I'm talking about, or don't, and then you shouldn't bother. In brief, all such works deal with what we can call Man's Relation to the Strange - the comings and goings, the gestures, dangers and requirements of a rite of passage. The relation itself does not fundamentally change, but it dresses in metaphors congenial to the era. Before long we shall probably have a cyberpunk \\"Labyrinth,\\" where a hero or heroine finds her way through machine-land, resists its charms but carries back to the human world a diplomatic understanding. And an ability to call for help. <br /> <br />And that's enough; like I said, either you know what I mean or not. The point of this review is to ask that you, Mr. Viewer, watch the movie VERY CAREFULLY and try to understand what each scene tries to accomplish and how. Not everything will make sense, there is a lot of sheer fun going on here, and laughs, and crazy puppets. Good things all, they keep up the mood. As I said, Henson hardly intended to make statements with the movie, other than that we need imagination in our daily lives, or something like that. But this is NOT what I'm talking about. Pay attention rather to the Labyrinth itself, to its challenges, to Sarah's responses. To the baby, too. What is the role of that toddler? Why is he completely passive - kidnapped, held, recovered, and nothing else? What does he stand for? <br /> <br />Look for symbols with moderation, of course, and don't forget to have fun. The first time through you'll probably have nothing else. But neither should you forget that there is more to the picture. It deserves multiple viewings... dig in it for precious nuggets.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|I first heard Irish singer/songwriter Damien Rice (duetting with Lisa Hannigan) on Herbie Hancock's 2005 CD `Possibilities' on the brilliant song `Don't explain'.<br /><br />`9' is his sophomore disc, and as I haven't listened to his debut `O', I'll judge this on its own.<br /><br />His style is alternative/folk with cryptic/poetic lyrics, and opening cut, the dreamy piano duet with Lisa Hannigan `9 crimes' is a perfect way to open the CD. `The animals were gone' is a lush, string laden ballad with gently shuffling percussion building up to a violin crescendo and haunting harmonies. Brilliant!<br /><br />`Elephant' is one of my favourites. Starting off as a tender forlorn acoustic ballad, which gradually builds up, musically and vocally to a raging rocker.<br /><br />Raising the tempo is the catchy, angry `Rootless tree', followed by the lovely acoustic ballad `Dogs'. In a similar vein is the ballad `Grey room'.<br /><br />`Coconut skins' is a sing-a-long folk song which sounds like something Simon & Garfunkel would do (complete with la la la la la la la). `Me, my yoke and I' is a surging semi distorted rocker with repetitive lyrics. Catchy and great!!!<br /><br />Another simply outstanding track is the heartbreaking piano ballad `Accidental babies' with Damien wondering in a lamenting voice if she brushes her teeth before kissing her new boyfriend, and `do you miss my smell?'. Stunning!!!<br /><br />Closing the CD is the acoustic lullaby-like ballad `Sleep, don't sleep' about the teary end of a relationship, with a soothing vocal delivery from Damien.<br /><br />This is one of my favourite albums of the year.
032147404X|5.0|This is an excellent book.  He gives straight to the point tips as far as settings and that is all 99.9% of photographers looking for tips need.  No need to give the entire history of how the camera came to be.<br /><br />However, I found the author to be an equipment snob.  Yes, more expensive lenses are generally better but you can do great work with the kit that comes with the camera.  My old Minolta has 'gasp' a cheap Sigma lenses but I have many photos that I know I could not better with even the top of the line equipment.  So people enjoy the book but do not feel you have to go out and buy $1,000+ lenses to get good pictures.
B00000DQSS|5.0|Surfing the Net recently, I came upon what in some circles was a notoriously nasty critique of Kate Bush's work by the American rock critic Dave Marsh.  You may have read it in the first ROLLING STONE RECORD GUIDE from the 70s, namely that she sounded \\"like the consequences of mating Patti Smith with a Hoover vacuum cleaner.\\"  Well, Marsh was of course one of the founding fathers (or founding self-described teenage dwarves) behind CREEM Magazine, and if you remember CREEM, fondly or otherwise, you still have to ask yourself what the heck the editors of the RS RECORD GUIDE were thinking, assigning the likes of Marsh to review Britain's reigning queen or art rock.  Marsh was the quintessential American ROCK--no, make that ROCK'N'ROLL critic: if it wasn't three minutes of three chord power pop, he didn't want anything to do with it.  No way Kate Bush was not going to be his cup of meat.    But the Patti Smith comparison was certainly intriguing.  Most people, when comparing the veddy British Kate with American female singer-songwriters, mention Joni Mitchell (Canadian by birth, but who's counting) or Laura Nyro (New Yorker by birth, which made her suspect to many other Americans, but who's counting there either).  But Patti Smith?  Well, that's not such a stretch as all that.  There's a moment in Kate Bush's track \\"Delius,\\" on this album, that she slips into a Patti-style-American-Indian chant.  The similarity is actually uncanny: briefly. But of course, Patti Smith was carving out her poetry in a punk rock context.  And Kate was coming from a British art rock tradition (she was discovered as a teenager by Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour) that in turn had its roots in Celtic folk and Classical European traditions in general.  But in significant ways, both women were already stretching those traditions and re-defining them from the very outset of their careers.  So the similarity is real. The tradition actually mattered less than the urge to extend it and, to a great degree,move beyond it.    The comparison with Laura Nyro is also significant.  Nyro was similarly eclectic and similarly inclined to shatter the traditional forms she loved (in her case American R&B, Doo Wop, Broadway, folk and some classical).  She also had her own unique sense of language and an ability to create whole universes within three minute pop songs.  All three women met with initial critical acclaim and quickly garnered strong cult followings (and some mass recognition to boot).  And then they all pretty much retreated--much to their fans chagrin and to some critical taunts of burn-out--mainly to raise their families.  Dropping out was not a permanent state for any of them, and, in many ways, their refusal to sacrifice their personal and (just as significantly) their ARTISTIC lives on the altar of show biz actually serve to make them all the more credible as genuine artists.    And of course, when they DID come back, they did so on their own terms.    But I digress, I suppose.  At the time of NEVER FOR EVER, Kate Bush was still a relatively new phenomenon.  And in her home country, she really was a phenomenon.  Her singles had all done quite well, thank you very much.  And if she remained a virtual unknown in the US, her popularity extended to the European continent handily.  I recall that when my ex and I were staying with a French family she had previously lived with on an exchange program, I innocently asked their teenager daughter if she knew Kate Bush, \\"Mais oui,\\" she said and starting singing, \\"Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka Ya Ya.\\"    Now Kate had been a European discovery for me and my then-bride when we were living in Germany.  NEVER FOR EVER was the one recording I had not heard yet when I posed that question to the young Veronique in France, but as soon as I got back to Deutschland I sought out a copy of the cassette version of that record--in part because of Vero's cute little rendition of Kate's continental hit.  (Spot on, actually).  And I was not disappointed.  We had bought THE KICK INSIDE and THE DREAMING pretty much at the same time, loved them both, but were curious about how she got from point A to point OMEGA-to-the-nth-power.  (Yes, I had never heard anything quite like THE DREAMING before in my life).  LIONHEART had proven to be KICK INSIDE TWO (aka: KICK HARDER).  Finally, laying my hands on NEVER FOR EVER was the great aha! moment.  That's where you hear the transition.  Still lots of whimsy and girlish charm, but things start getting a little more dangerous too, a little spookier.    And not just in terms of the lyrics.  Kate Bush had always had a Gothic sensibility from the outset, leavened with humor, of course, a delightful sense of off-handed mysticism.  And lots of melodic hooks, hooks, hooks!  The girl could just churn out tune after quirky, catchy tune.  Well, the hooks are still here on this album, but they serve to highlight a darker lyrical vision.  Murderous revenge for a Wedding Day Massacre (sounds as though it might have been ripped from current US headlines, but no, its inspiration is a Truffaut movie) and women feeling erotic impulses toward the children in their charge (even more of a contemporary headline case, but again, inspired by cinematic--and ultimately--literary sources: this time Henry James by way of Hollywood).  Still this kind of stuff(\\"The Infant Kiss\\"--or as it might also be called \\"The Child With the Man In His Eyes--could get you BANNED in this country.  Luckily for Kate, it remains obscure enough for most people not to have had a chance to misunderstand it.  (She's not advocating anything: she's telling a story).    The major departure for Kate with this record, though, is probably more in terms of production than in lyrical content.  This was the first record that she co-produced, and it shows.  There was always a certain textural (as well as textual) richness to the early stuff, but it's more sharply defined on this record.  It is a solid step forward, maybe even bold--not yet a gigantic leap into the abyss (that would come a few years later with the release of--what many, including myself--consider her masterpiece, THE DREAMING.      Speaking of comparisons, the only time I ever subscribed to an actual fanzine was one dedicated to Kate.  Called BREAKTHROUGH, the ads for it used to say, \\"Bigger Than The Beatles!\\"  I used to wonder why anyone would compare a solo woman performer with ANY group--let alone a group as iconic as the Beatles.  But I realized later that it's no more absurd than comparing Kate to Patti Smith or Laura Nyro (I don't really see much basis for a Joni comparision, however--other than they've both been boldly experimental).  Listening to the production values of NEVER FOR EVER, I'm reminded of the great Beatles experiments of a decade or so earlier.  Slamming doors, footsteps, disembodied voices lecturing about the aftereffects of nuclear war, \\"--all of these \\"effects\\" are successfully interwoven into the musical whole.  The music doesn't suffer for their inclusion.  These are sound effects that actually work.  They hold up over repeated listenings.  And that's hard to achieve. And what about those eerie tape loops on \\"Egypt\\" reminiscent of nothing so much as \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" I don't know if the young Kate Bush could fairly be described as \\"BIGGER than the Beatles,\\" but the comparison is certainly interesting.  For a solo artist to even be in the same league is remarkable.  For a young woman barely out of her teens at the time this album was released), it's pretty darn astonishing.
038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan is amazing: each book he writes is not only a different style from the last on but also better than the last one. An unusual combination of character study, history, tragedy, and good story telling, this novel is written beautifully. We read this for our Book Group, and the discussion included many rave reviews. Read it slowly and savor!
B000IHY9SE|5.0|I'm a huge Eminem fan, I really enjoyed this CD and look forward to any other projects that he is working on. Do any of you guys know if he will be dropping a CD of his own or is he just going to strictly be producing?
B000LC3ID8|5.0|Not being an avid fan of the first Saw and disliking a lot the second one, I nevertheless was very surprised in a good way about the third installment. Yes, it's utterly relentless and gory, I saw people covering their eyes with hands in a theater, even I winced a couple of times although I had seen many of the films alike. But what I liked the most here was not the brutal nature of Saw III (and it's quite important for the fans when a movie lives up to its R-rating, so that they can say money was spent wisely) and not even the intricate story-line that keeps you surprised and on the edge of your seat all the time. Not the final twist which was expected of course but surely you didn't know what it would be exactly.<br /><br />The main merit of the third part is that it doesn't appear to be a usual stupid sequel that lacks ideas, it brings some new sense into the series, glues all the three films together making a perfect trilogy out of it which now can be watched as a one big 5-hour film. There's plenty of flashbacks here that explain a lot from the second and even the first part, and some things become clear that were not in the ends of previous series. It really takes talent to make a movie that not just stands alone, but adds a lot to the other parts and completes them. Guys that were making it are true professionals and real maniacs :)<br /><br />And apart from being as it seems overly gory and graphic Saw III can boast of being rather thoughtful too. The evil genius of Jigsaw (and of the makers of the film) made the characters (and us along with them) think about rage and its manifestations, about revenge and people's insatiable urge to punish those who took their beloved ones. By quite simple examples inclusive of flesh-ripping, bone-crushing, joint-wresting etc. the killer himself shows us killing is bad. Those will survive who don't succumb to the desire of payback. Only forgiving can grant forgiveness for ourselves. And that's the rule for everyone, even for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken. Otherwise death awaits you as well as your victims. In this movie Jigsaw is seen not as an ordinary killer maniac, but as some kind of a teacher if you will. So this time his puzzles must be solved not only using strength, keen wit and will to live, but also by testing your own virtue and that's something new for this kind of flicks, don't you agree?<br /><br />I don't know what they will do with Saw IV, because the third part wrapped it all very nice making a perfectly neat structure of a trilogy. I'd leave it like that. You can top previous parts in respect of blood and guts, but it'll be pretty hard to keep the same level of thoughtfulness the third part established.ven for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken.

B000JJRIN4|5.0|`The sweet escape' is the follow up to the multiplatinum smash debut release `Love.angel.music.baby' by Gwen Stefani. Where its predecessor had an eclectic sound showing her off as a musical chameleon, this one plants her firmly into two styles; hip hop/pop and 80s pop/new wave. No fears, she's still as kooky and off kilter as ever!<br /><br />The charming `4 in the morning' with a catchy chorus falls into the latter. Other songs in this vein are the lovely midtempo eurodisco `Wonderful life' (hello Kylie and Madonna), the yearning rock ballad `Early winter' (co written with Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley), `U started it', and the swinging sixties sounding title track `The sweet escape' with Akon on backing vocals.<br /><br />Lead off single, the yodel fest `Wind it up' falls into the hip hop/pop category. Sampling The sound of music's `Lonely goatherd' no less, you'll either love it or loathe it. Produced by the Neptunes, it's got a sparse, throbbing atonal feel with clunky percussion, as does `Yummy' (which reminds one of Kelis' Neptune's produced 'Milkshake') featuring Pharrell, and a superb epic marching band outro.<br /><br />I love the autobiographical midtempo `Orange county girl' which is half rapped/sung and talking about her life from humble beginnings to 'living in an extra ordinary world' today. The bouncy `Don't get it twisted' is ska tinged, and 'Breaking up' is Japanese inflected electro pop.<br /><br />Not as great as L.A.M.B but still good and hugely danceable. This album does take repeated playing for one to get into it, but it does provide a sweet escape...
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I don't even know where to start. Gwen's solo debut was one of my favorite guilty pleasures of 2004. I was immediately addicted to its fun, creative, catchy, retro electropop tunes. It was the type of stuff that (unfortunately) you don't typically find on mainstream radio. But she made it work, and shone a light on a cool \\"new\\" sound. For a minute there, I thought she alone was going to bring pop back to what it once was (and should be), but wow - was I completely wrong. Instead of expanding on her incredible and inventive electropop, she decided to take the one really crappy song from LAMB (\\"Hollaback Girl\\") and make an entire album that all sounds just like it. I mean, there are no melodies here! It's just generic hip-hop beats with dumb lyrics that you can't even sing along to. The only decent song on the entire album is \\"Wonderful Life.\\" Ugh! I can't express how extremely disappointed I am in her. All my love and respect for her has suddenly gone bye-bye. I was really looking forward to her becoming the new Pop Queen - but instead it appears she's just another bland R&B clone. At least she's chosen a core demographic: teens. Sadly for her, though, she's going to have to say \\"so long\\" to all her fans over 21 years old.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|This cd is amazing.  Every track is fun, original, and \\"delicious\\" as Gwen would say.  She just keeps making superb music!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|My DH told me to be at the T.V. at 8PM sharp last night because he had a surprise, and WOW I forgot all about the PBS special last night. The Celtic Woman were on and it was they're New Journey concert.  I think that it was better than the first concert if that is even possible.  All six girls were at they're finest and I really enjoyed it and the songs were great. All the girls were more relaxed around each other and Chloe's voice has greatly improved as ever, Lisa,Orla and Meav were fantastic as well. Haley the new girl fit in as well. Finally Maire'ad what can I say about her but great.  Now I'm not sure if I should buy the DVD first or risk trying to find the CD at the store or pre-order that as well. AH WELL, decisions
0312330537|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  <br /> <br />Shantaram is an almost magical tale of one man's escape from prison and reinvention, facing one's own demons, life, love, good and evil all set against the backdrop of exotic, mystical India.  <br /> <br />I adored Prabaker, he's probably one of my all time favourite characters from a novel (isn't it! ha!). All the characters are so vividly written. My only criticism is that Robert's prose can sometimes get a little too poetic and overwrought - dare I say \\"fluffy\\" - especially towards the middle of the book. It's a small flaw and very easily overlooked, I blame the editors! It could have used a bit more editing to cut out the superfluous descriptions and philosophizing.  <br /> <br />I honestly don't care whether this novel is based on true, actual events or if it's got a few embellishments here and there. It's a magnificent tale. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves an extraordinary, exotic, multilayered story.  <br /> <br />Like many other readers I'm sure, this book has definitely piqued my interest in India.  <br /> <br />Buy it, read it, you won't regret it. I think it may be a contender for one of my all time favourites.
0451167716|4.0|Spectacular! This book is the best that we have read. You will never be able to put this book down because of all the action packed adventures. Mario Puzzo brought us into the world of crime, adventure, romance, betrayal, vengeance, and culture. This book will show you the true meaning of crime. Although, the changing of scenery makes a real puzzling and unique book, some readers feel it confuses them from the story. To conclude, we believe this book is a masterpiece of this generation and generations to come.

El personaje central se tilda a s&iacute; mismo de cacaseno, precisamente el vocablo que utilizaba MVLL contra los apristas en las elecciones del 90.

0767830555|5.0|The 1970's are widely regarded as perhaps the most artistically exciting era in film, and \\"Taxi Driver\\" stands as one of the finest films of that great period and 30 years later, \\"Taxi Driver\\" is still Scorsese's best film and one of the greatest films of all time.  If, for whatever reason, you have any interest in films at all and still haven't seen \\"Taxi Driver\\", don't put it off another day.<br /><br />\\"Taxi Driver's\\" inimitable success is rooted in its two most prominent and seemingly conflicting elements: De Niro's brilliant, empathetic and real lead performance alongside Scorsese's expressionistic, overblown visuals.  Countless films have portrayed the city, and New York City in particular, as a hellish netherworld, but few do so as absolutely and convincingly as \\"Taxi Driver\\".  The NYC of \\"Taxi Driver\\" is a blinding, neon-lit freakshow of streetwalkers, killers and (worst of all) politicians where the billowing steam rises from sewer vents to hide the squalor in an opaque mist and the rain pours forever down.  Few viewers are liable to be too fond of what they see in this unreal city, and neither does Travis Bickle, our tortured anti-hero and one of the most memorable characters in all film.  Schrader deserves a lot of credit for conceiving Bickle so brilliantly, but few actors, if any, could've brought life to his contradictory yet somehow understandable personality like Robert De Niro.  These three figures, Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro, are the core of the film, but almost everything else comes together to perfection as well.<br /><br />This film is all about Travis Bickle, so much so that he's never off screen for more than a minute or two at a time, and not often at that.  Travis isn't from New York City, and isn't a part of it, though he still, somehow, seems to belong.  Bickle  is a lot of things, but his main trait is obvious from the get-go:  He is alone, alienated.  He hates the city;  he prays for the rain to come wash the filth from the streets, but he's drawn to those streets at the same time.  Travis, unable to sleep at night, decides to become a taxi driver even though he loathes and fears his clientele.  His reasons for taking the job, though unstated, are apparent:  Better to face the depravity of the streets than live alone with the uncertainty and emptiness within himself day in and day out.  When not working Travis sits alone in his dingy apartment, staring at the television with indifference, pours his anger into his diary and haunts seedy downtown porno theaters.  He feels a need to find something more, something outside of himself, but he doesn't know what it could be.  Before too long he finds a cause, a reason to exist, in the form of the beautiful campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and, later, the plight of teen-runaway Iris (Jodie Foster).  He wants to be with them, to protect them, but do they want that?  Do they need that?<br /><br />Bickle is a great character, for me anyway, because he's just a first-rate, if highly exaggerated and malformed, representation of the conflicts that breed in many people, particularly young men, I think. (Myself included.)  Bickle is a pure embodiment of idealism/romanticism curdling into bitter cynicism; the former, however, never totally dies and serves as fuel for the latter.  Travis acutely feels the sort of hopelessness that comes with this perspective; there's nothing Bickle can do, nothing logical, anyway, that will make any difference in the depraved world,  so he mindlessly loathes the darkness and clings to the few remaining misplaced threads of idealism (Placed in the two women he obsesses over, neither of whom much resembles what he imagines them to be) a coping method which inexorably leads to his final explosion.  As far as personal reflections go I, and almost all of us who can feel for Travis, aren't 1/1000 as messed up and nutty as he is, but the reflection is still there and that makes him really hit home.  You can't excuse his behavior,nor does the film ask you to, but you can see where he's coming from.  (Well, for the most part.  Some of the leaps he makes are pretty out there, but he *is* a nut...)<br /><br />I haven't said all that much about the plot so far, but there isn't really that much to say.  Travis drives the cab, fixates on the two females, muses on and on and eventually loses it at the violent finale.  But man, there are some great individual scenes stuffed in this frame:  Travis picks up a deranged man (played by Scorsese) who gives a chilling monologue about his plans to punish his unfaithful spouse; Travis converses with Wizard (A great turn from Peter Boyle) about life; We see Bickle's bizarre training regimen in his apartment as he prepares for the end; Travis humiliates himself horribly when he tries to go after Betsy. These individually great scenes all come together in climax that is absolutely stunning and brutal.<br /><br />A few odds and ends:<br /><br />- I love the criticism of politicians found here.  The film just has Palantine talk for some time and he *never* comes close to saying anything meaningful.  You can't fight your way through the slogans and double-talk, cause that's all there is.<br /><br />- \\"Taxi Driver\\" has some effective humor in it for such a bleak film.  I particularly enjoy the lie-filled letter Travis composes to his parents towards the end.<br /><br />- I'm not a huge fan of the score.  It works well in the most dramatic scenes but, as usual, Hermann never lets off.  He's always overblown beyond belief.<br /><br />- I don't have a strong position on whether the ending is reliable or not.  Both ways work for me.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Brilliant movie.<br /><br />Grade: Aehavior, nor does the film ask you to, but you can see where he's coming from.  (Well, for the most part.

B000JJRIN4|4.0|My initial reaction when I heard the intro for \\"Wind It Up\\" was fear.  I enjoyed the song myself, but I was afraid for Gwen, and what the public might think of the strange concoction of sounds she threw together.    Having said that, let me be one of the first to praise this album.  After the initial confusion wore off and I listened to \\"Wind It Up\\" in its entirety, I was pleasantly surprised and quite entertained.  Fans will say the birth of her son softened her and she lost a bit of her 'edge'.  True: this album isn't quite as catchy as her debut.  However, artistically, Gwen shines brighter here (and I'm not just talking about the gorgeous album art).  She's tried something a little more personal and deeper here.    Gwen's always been all over the map, sprinkling bits of old fashioned music into her modern beats.  The great news here is she's taken it one step further, adding the aforementioned yodeling, more syncopation and richer, warmer musical arrangements.    \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"4 In The Morning\\" are both delicate and sweet ballads, thick with moving melody lines and sensitive lyrics.  \\"U Started It\\" has a lovely retro groove (even if it feels somewhat out of place on the album).  The closer of the album, \\"Wonderful Life\\", begins and ends like a Coldplay track, which is interesting and intriguing.      But this sophomore effort by Gwen doesn't lack for club tracks and catchy basslines.  \\"Wind It Up\\" is already causing a stir, with it's strange combination of samplings from one of Gwen's 'favorite things,' \\"The Sound Of Music\\", and those same infectious claps and slaps we all loved so much in \\"Hollaback Girl\\".  There will never be another \\"Hollaback Girl\\".  But that doesn't mean there can't be something brand new and exciting, either.  A major highlight of the album is \\"Yummy\\", which features Pharrell.  The entire song is a masterpiece of addicting rhymes and drumbeats, and just when you think the song is done, in come the drums again, and a few horns.  \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" may very well be my favorite track of the album.  The familiarity of the melody line in the chorus stays with you long after the song is finished, and Gwen's genius ways of throwing together catchy beats and oldschool synth sounds are best put to use here.  \\"The Sweet Escape\\" has an incredibly memorable vocal arrangement, featuring plenty of repeated 'wahoo's' and 'yeehoo's.'      In general, \\"Sweet Escape\\" seems much warmer and more inviting than her debut.  It's as if the sharp edges of Gwen's music have been fuzzed a bit with an eraser or a soft smudge of the fingertips.  She sounds a little bit more romantic and subdued.  This 'version' of Stefani may be a bit more introverted, but she still looks and sounds beautiful nontheless.
B000002G23|5.0|This is going out to all of the fans out there. It doesn't matter if you have all the old CD's or vinyl. You are going to want to get this collection anyway. Not because it might have a few tracks you don't have in your collection (although you get just about every Police song ever recorded), but because all of them are digitally remastered. I'm not talking about some slight remaster you might have gotten from other CDs. This is the real deal.  <br /> <br />I have put these songs against other Police CDs I have gotten over the years and there is a major difference in the audio quality. You thought the clarity was tight before, but you haven't heard anything yet. The improvements made to the original masters is like night and day. Unless you have those newly remastered Digipack import CD's this is the way to go.  <br /> <br />Not only do you get the whole enchilada music-wise, but the booklet that comes with the set is equally worthwile. You get pictures of EVERY album and CD made to date, a history of the band that doesn't shy away from the controversy, and informative biographies of the artists. All in all this is what a box set is supposed to be like.  <br /> <br />
B00007AJF8|5.0|Unlike probably most \\"Being John Malkovich\\" fans, I actually saw the later Kaufman-Jonze collaboration \\"Adaptation\\" first.  I thought, and think, that that movie is brilliant, but I was a little disappointed in \\"Being John Malkovich\\" the first time I saw it.  It was very good, yes, but I was hoping for a bit more, since most reviewers seem to think it as good or better than that later film.  Well, yesterday I got through watching \\"Being John Malkovich\\" for the third time, about 2 years after I first saw it, and it's grown on me quite a bit.  I still don't think it's quite as good as \\"Adaptation\\", but it's pretty close.<br /><br />\\"Being John Malkovich\\" is one of those movies that seems to take place in the real world, except that there are a bunch of odd details that aren't right.  Ex: Puppeteering is a major artform; everyone in the world is a total oddball; there's a building with a 7 1/2 floor which contains a portal into John  Malkovich's brain.  This movie is so massively yet still so unobtrusively weird that I'm sure it requires a very specific taste to fully get into it.  You definitely need a taste for the odd.<br /><br />The story centers around Craig Schwartz, (John Cusack) a failed street-puppeteer who lives in depression with his strange but good-natured wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) and their 100 or so pets.  Lotte suggests that Craig get a job, a real job, and he does so, becoming a filing clerk at a small business on the 7 1/2 floor of a large office building. (The ceiling is all of 4 1/2 feet high, and they have to emergency-stop the elevator to get to the floor.)  Craig is immediately smitten with fellow 7 1/2 floor-dweller Maxine (Catherine Keener).  Maxine is a cruel and cold-hearted individual, but Craig can't help himself and continues to pursue her in spite of her utter contempt for him.  His efforts appear to be going nowhere until one day when he finds a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet.  He crawls in it to discover that this is a portal into John Malkovich's brain, where you watch what Malkovich sees for 15 minutes, after which you are dumped in a ditch by the road  And then things really get weird, as Craig uses this portal as a way to connect with Maxine, but Lotte and others get drawn in and Malkovich finds out what's going on and we learn of the real purpose of the portal and on and on.  I don't want to go on, cause the inexplicable, labyrinthine plot is much of the appeal of the film.  (Though it isn't just crazy for crazy's sake, and actually comes together well.)  Beyond this, Kaufman has tons of clever, intelligent dialogue to support the wacky plot.<br /><br />This movie is damn hard to review, cause it's so strange, and yet much of the appeal and humor is character-driven.  The unbelievable, oddball characters are all interesting, usually funny and often endearing.  Cusack is our main character and sort of the straight man of the film.  Still, he's not quite normal-- He does, after all, want to be a famous puppeteer.  He's a typical \\"tortured artist\\" with a scruffy beard and a ponytail, but you can't help but like him.  He's just so hapless, and John Cusack always does the average man thing well.  Orson Bean is great as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss and a 125 year old lech.  (As Craig says, \\"It's pretty funny once you get past how disgusting it is.)  Catherine Keener is fantastic as Maxine, one of the most black-hearted  characters I've ever seen.  Yeah, she doesn't physically hurt anyway, but her relentless verbal abuse is unbelievable, as she responds to anything Craig says to her with a vicious, personal barb.  Finally, John Malkovich is wonderful as himself (sort of), and he hits a great range of notes and isn't afraid to make himself look bad.  (No one with half a brain would think this really has anything to do with who Malkovich really is, but lotsa people don't have half a brain...)<br /><br />Though \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is a comedy, it's a rather thoughtful and ultimately very sadone.  It touches on themes of isolation, the desire to be someone else and the ultimate absurdity and uncontrollability of human life.  This absurdity is encapsulated in the central conflict, in Craig's unrequited love for Maxine; there's no reason why he should love her, she is, as Craig himself says, evil, but he can't help himself;  Man is capable of reason, but emotion rules us and emotion only sporadically makes sense. (And applying reason to emotion never helps, not in my experience, anyway.)<br /><br />Though I can't help but see Kaufman as the primary author of the film, Jonze deserves a ton of credit for bringing the vision to fruition.  Making a film this wacky seem real must be damn near impossible, but Jonze pulls it off with aplomb and spectacular technical proficiency.  The film moves from near conventional scenes to first-person perspective, to dream sequences and flat out surrealism.  Yet, for all the technique displayed in the film, it rarely seems extraneous.  Jonze doesn't seem to be showing off, the flash is all just necessary to navigate the inexplicable plot.  The score is also fantastic, truly beautiful and often-moving, and it allows for a lot of the emotional impact in the film, particularly in the brilliantly conceived and heartbreaking final scene.<br /><br />Man, this review is no good, but you can't do justice to a movie this good and this odd in a review.  You'll just have to watch it.<br /><br />Grade: Avery sad one.  It touches on themes of isolation, the desire to be someone else and the ultimate absurdity and uncontrollability of human life.

B00005JPD0|4.0|So what if the terrorist is one lone nut who was rejected by the military for being too much of a psycho.  Muslim terrorists are getting boring.  9/11 was in many ways a fluke and occurred because the people who could have stopped it weren't allowed to for a variety of reasons: FBI guys had \\"sharp elbows\\", CIA guys were being \\"geeky\\" when they brought it up, etc.  If just one element of oversight hadn't occurred, they would have been stopped.  And we could have destroyed most of Bin Laden's network if the hawks hadn't pushed for Iraq.  Come on, it was some people with box cutters who can be easily stopped if everyone is allowed to do their job.  The Patriot Act was just a sham to erode civil liberties and gain momentum for later activities.  I personally dig the idea that loner Caviezal is pretty much proving to the world how good a SPECOP soldier he could have been by masterminding and carrying out this entire thing by himself.  That's a unique concept and he plays a convincing sociopath of the type that is capable of raping and murdering in some foreign war if they had accepted him.<br /><br />I also like the time machine, as it bares a close resemblance to the believable one in Twelve Monkeys: a huge superconducting-supercolliding, high-voltage, solid-state thingy with a bunch of logistics surrounding it...and a teeny little portal on the business end.  That and the techno-babble involved had an air of authenticity.  The scene where Washington shines a laser pointer at what previously he just assumed was a flat-panel display is absolutely genius.  So many times during this film in the theater I could see half the audience literally lean forward in anticipation.<br /><br />One of the strongest elements in the film is the acting.  These people all have excellent chemistry.  The writing is also neither overdone nor underdone.  I got excited when Val Kilmer tells the head tech to \\"turn off the lights\\" when he's finished, rather than give some lecture about grandfather paradoxes.  We feel like they really have gotten to know one another in the last few days and are willing to give each other respectful room to make choices or take risks.  That speaks to a surprising level of emotional maturity to the writing that carries back over to the acting, especially in Washington's moments of longing for this dead woman.<br /><br />And finally, this movie is a feat of post-production.  This is by far the best looking Tony Scott film, from both an aesthetic standpoint and a technical one.  The ferry explosion was flawless.  In the time portal lab or office, whatever you want to call it, every single color was lovingly tweaked, right down to little pastel highlights on laptop corners.  And I gotta say, Century Theaters at the Orleans Casino did the film print proud.  I've been wasting my money over at the Palms, where the lamps seem to be in low-contrast econo-mode and the teenage projectionists appear to need glasses.  D&eacute;j&agrave; vu won't win any non-technical Oscars, but it's not a bad way to spend $8.feel like they really have gotten to know one another in the last few days and are willing to give each other respectful room to make choices or take risks.

0743289412|1.0|Thanks to Flying Vee for her (1 star) review, I agree. <br />I have read every Stephen King book published.   <br />I stuck with this book and made it halfway through the book before I felt that I was wasting my time.  I didn't like the \\"baby talk\\" made-up words.  This seemed like a book that Stephen King wrote for his wife to show what would happen if he died. I didn't enjoy reading every single thought that passed through Lisey's head.  A story has to MOVE ALONG.  I was disappointed because I had great anticipation of a nice big fat King novel that would keep me awake late into the night.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I absolutely loved the album.. Thank you Gwen for deciding to put out another solo! The Sweet Escape is very hip-hop which I love. I liked it more than L.A.M.B... The song produced by Swizz Beats is absolutely amazing...  Im so excited for her upcoming tour. I LOVE YOU GWEN! 5 stars!
0380789035|5.0|Shadow, a man whose life is torn apart just when he thought it was getting better, is all-too-conveniently offered a job by a mysterious man who seems to know a little too much. It becomes obvious all too soon that his employer and his associates (not to mention their enemies) are more than men, and they're not quite willing to let Shadow know what exactly is going on.<br /><br />If you're a mythology buff and you don't mind Gaiman taking some liberties with the personalities of various deities, you'll love this. I was a fan of Sandman and Good Omens (co-authored with Terry Pratchett, who I also strongly reccommend) before I read American Gods, and I like the way he takes different mythologies and recombines them into a new story, even when it's not entirely true to the original myth. This book continues that theme, and it does so wonderfully.<br /><br />If you know your mythology, you'll have a fun game of hide-and-seek with all the gods he's packed in here- some of them are fairly obscure, and I don't think there are any of the more popular Greek or Roman gods mentioned. And if you pay close enough attention, you can figure out who the mysterious Mr. Wednesday is long before it is revealed to Shadow.

B00000DHR0|5.0|When I got this CD from my friend as a birthday present, I was feeling a bit sceptical. But after hearing the opening track which is O Holy Night, oh my god, this version is the best version of the song ever and l fell in love with this album.  <br />I will break down the review for each track. <br />1. O Holy Night - The best redention of the song ever. She sings it powerfully and full of emotion. You will be blown away. No one can outdone Celine's O Holy Night.    <br />2.Don't Save It All for Christmas Day - This song was written by Celine. This song reminds us to give or show love to everyone everyday. Clay Aiken even covered this song on his Christmas Album. <br />3. Blue Christmas - This song shows a jazzy side of Celine. Smoky, mellow Christmas song, you will love it. Diana Krall on piano; you can't go wrong :)  <br />4. Another Year Has Gone By - Laid back, a relaxing song. Bryan Adams wrote this song.  <br />5. The Magic of Christmas Day - uptempo catchy Christmas song done by Celine. I like the 'Christmas Eve' - track 11 better though.  <br />6. Ave Maria - It is heavenly sung and powerful. I don't particularly care about this song too much.  <br />7. Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful) - Beautiful and churcy with chruch organ and choir. <br />8. The Christmas Song - A nice soothing christmas song to warm up your Christmas spirit. <br />9. The Prayer - This song has a nice lyric and full of meaning, making us believe in angels <br />10. Brahm' Lullaby - A lullaby song good for sleeping. :)  <br />11. Christmas Eve - This is one of the best new songs in the album. This song reminds me of MAriah Carey's  All I Want For Christmas For You.  It's upbeat and catchy, making you want to go out and have fun on Christmas eve. <br />12. These Are The Special Times - a well done song written by Diane Warren. Christina Aguilera did a cover of this song for her Christmas album. But Celine's version is much better than her.  <br />13. Happy Xmas (War is Over) - I love this song since it has a peace message for everyone and she did a fantastic cover of John & Yoko'. I also like the cover sung by Sarah McLachlan.  <br />14. I'm Your Angel - It used to be my favorite song. This song was no.1 on the billboard chart for a couple weeks.  <br />15.Feliz Navidad - Celine with Family wishing us Xmas.  <br />16. Les Cloches Du Hameau - it's so so, this track is my least favorite.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you like a well professionally arranged Christmas album (David Foster produced some of the songs) you should definetely be getting this album. Also this album makes a perfect gift for Christmas gift to everyone celebrating Christmas.  <br />Pairs this album with Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas and Sarah McLachlan's WinterSong, you are going to have a Christmas Blast. <br />
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Many of those who enjoy making overly ironic jokes routinely mentioned at the release of the new Gwen Stefani single, Wind it Up, that she was totally ripping of Fergie's faux rap style. Of course it was actually Stefani that started the trend that has also been utilized since by Nelly Furtado and Cassie with her Middle School anthems off her debut album. Granted long before Stefani and Fergie, Toni Basil was the first to revolutionize the singing cadence in her cheerleader inspired Mickey. There is a good chance that Basil may have inspired Stefani because it is apparent on Love Angel Music Baby as well as her latest release, The Sweet Escape, that she loves the 80's almost as much as VH1. <br /> <br />After going even further back in time with the Sound of Music sampling Wind it Up to open the album, the 80's influences come fast and often. Early Winter sounds like Cyndi Lauper through the No Doubt filter circa Simple Kind of Life. The song, produced by the keyboardist from Keane, is easily the standout track, but mostly because there is little competition. The next closest track is 4 in the Morning, produced by No Doubt's Tony Kanel, which has a mid-eighties R&B feel to it as Stefani sounds like a one woman version of The Jets. <br /> <br />Elsewhere on the album the eighties elements fall flat. On Fluorescent the song is about one note away from blatantly ripping of the classic from the decad Human by The Human League. The Neptunes continue there downfall with a few weak tracks on the album including Yummy which Stefani herself says, \\"This sounds like disco Tetris.\\" I can't imagine anyone else would think that is a good idea. They also produced the ill-advised Breakin' Up. No it is not about dumping a boyfriend, it is instead about a dropped phone call. And it even turns out lamer than it sounds. Trying to recreate Hollaback Girl, we get Don't Get it Twisted chalk full of profanities and a chorus that lift the melody from the Ringling Brothers. The big differentis that this song is much less chant worthy than its predecessor. Hopefully some time after this album Stefani realizes she is inching closer to forty and needs to get back together with her band and stop making trite music for thirteen year old girls. Oh yeah, and please don't ever yodel again, leave that to Jewel.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Although the Beatles officially broke up in 1970, their music has appeared in every decade mixed, mashed, compiled, and now creatively altered.  Love, the soundtrack to Cirque du Soleil's artistic and music celebration of the Beatles' music, is the closest to what the Beatles may have created within their Apple mystique.  With George Martin and son Giles Martin at the production reigns, the two come close to what could have been, but what is now.  Indeed, a labor of love of their music where samples of the band's original and alternate takes are meshed to create the ultimate Beatles sample.<br /><br />This compilation is a breathe of fresh air of musical creativity that has not been heard in a long time.  The re-mastered recordings are crisp and distinct, and are best listened with headphones in order to hear the full effect of each of the songs.  There are differences to the original recordings in songs, such as the beautiful \\"Something\\" where the lush string arrangements and subtle ukulele are recognizable; the medley \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" is a soulful romp in the Otis Redding tradition with horns that may have possibly been sampled from \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" an acappella version of \\"Because,\\" the very psychedelic \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Lucy in the sky with diamonds,\\" two of the most guitar driven tracks, \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Back in the USSR,\\" and the thumpin' bluesy \\"Come Together,\\" just to highlight a few.<br /><br />If you want to open your eyes and ears to the music of the band, Love will definitely do that.  It is a mystical and magical journey of one of the most influential rock and roll bands of the twentieth century.  If you've never heard or seen the Beatles before, this record will introduce you to their imaginative music genius, but hopefully lead you to the original recordings.

And when the camera turns his way, he's always ready to carry the day by turning accepted wisdom on its head. <br /> <br />\\"You know the guy who can pick up any girl? I'm him-on crack.\\" <br />\\"Michael Jordan plays ball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, Mr Naylor is good at what he does and he knows it. In his line of work, it comes with the territory. But things are not quite so rosy for old Nick. He's divorced. He's trying to raise his son right despite his ex despising what he stands for. His ideas for his industry's future get ripped off by his boss. He's even got to go on the occasional trip to bribe former tobacco icons. And then there are the live TV death threats. Yet despite it all, Naylor remains upbeat enough to still go back into the lions' den and sit for interviews with anti-smoking crusaders on TV, newspapers and even in Congress.  <br /> <br />One of the things that makes this movie great is its casting. Aaron Eckhart gives a wonderful performance as Naylor, but the supporting cast is just as well considered. Cameron Bright gives a remarkably subtle performance as son Joey. Maria Bello and David Koechner are the perfect foils for one another as Naylor's lobbyist compatriots. Even Rob Lowe gives a shamelessly smooth performance as the Katzenberg-inspired agent Jeff Megall. When the score is tallied, you have a moviethat does for lobbyists what \\"Wag the Dog\\" did for PR flacks, yet without the megawatt star power of Robert De Niro or Dustin Hoffman. <br /> <br />I love this movie-it's a gem. Writer and first-time director Jason Reitman has definitely learned something good from his father, legendary \\"Animal House\\" producer and \\"Ghostbusters\\" director Ivan Reitman, about how to put together a movie that is both funny and subtle at the same time. Fox Searchlight has put together a pretty good streak of intelligent low-budget movies lately, and this is another notch in their belts. How good is it? Let me put it this way: I know the resulting picture wouldn't be any good, but I want a sequel anyway! <br />
B000IHY9SE|2.0|theres so much better ish out there, & em comes with a wack album, and whats worse everybody on here sucks, the RMX's suck, the new artist are lame, Em & 50 should have made a album together and ditch the camp, Re-Up on the dro not this album, 1 decent single and everybody thinks the albums gonna b good, these reviewers get real, pucker up, 4 what, album is garbage 2 what they can bring, shady & the unit suck A*S, until they bring heat they should shut up, jimmy crack corn but this album i dont care, put it in fire so everybody in this album can think there hot.
0140441409|5.0|I have picked this book up a couple of times and am floored by what I read each time.  Even in today's time, 1,800 years later, much of what is said is relevant and useful.  Such quotes as \\"Accept modestly; surrender gracefully\\" and \\"Our anger and annoyance are more detrimental to us than the things themselves which anger or annoy us\\" are just two of the numerous pieces of wisdom and advice found in this book.    Although at times it did turn philosophical it always returned to the central theme of the overarching world created by Nature and Gods.  You are but a piece of it and must learn to live with it at peace.  Again, it is amazing to find something written so long ago still apply to today's world.    I have always been amazed when I read about Marcus Aurelius as Caesar, but now I am even more amazed at Marcus Aurelius as philosopher.  I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.    5 stars.
B000IHY9SE|3.0|Eminem Presents The Re-Up started out as a mixtape project, but Eminem decided to release the album so the new artists, Bobby Creekwater, Stat Quo, and Ca$his would gain more popularity. And yes, it was a good idea, even though the album felt like it was made for Eminem and 50 Cent. The new artists actually did some decent songs, but Eminem and 50 Cent gave the best performance. The best songs were Public Enemy #1 and No Apologies. No Apologies is one of the most serious songs he's made since The Eminem Show. That song is a classic. Eminem and 50 Cent did much better on this than they did on their last albums. Hopefully, if they eventually make new albums, they'll be as good as this. It's worth listening to and if you're an Eminem fan, buy it.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. It's being compared to Friends, but it's so much more cleverly written and the characters are believable as friends. Neil Patrick Harris steals the show every time. The rest of the cast is great as well.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|This DVD gets a definite five stars just for the thrill of finally seeing this fabled, long lost version of this popular film.  Not to rain on everyone's parade, but the actual film itself is more problematic.  It's definitely worth a view, though, especially for all you sci-fi/adventure film geeks (and I count myself among you).  Here are some quick impressions:<br /><br />I loved all the new Jor-El scenes.  I wasn't a \\"hater\\" of the Susannah York scenes in the Richard Lester cut of the movie, but Marlon Brando's Jor-El scenes are richer and more dramatic.  They really pack a wallop.<br /><br />I'm really glad they cut out most of the dumb jokes from the Lester cut, as well as several head-scratching elements, like the big cellophane \\"S\\" that Superman was strangely able to generate from his chest insignia, and an apparent teleportation ability.  All gone, thankfully!<br /><br />But they also removed a lot of Lester's good material, such as most of the battle scenes in the small midwestern town shortly after the Kryptonian villains landed on Earth.  In other words, there was a tendency to remove Lester material just BECAUSE it was Lester material, regardless of whether it was good or bad.  This was especially unfortunate when there wasn't corresponding Richard Donner material available to replace the removed Lester footage.  The result: some choppiness and a less-epic quality.<br /><br />The power-stripping molecule chamber used in this new cut is much more elegant looking than the cheap-looking version used in the Lester cut.  Gone also are the cheesy effects used when Superman is stripped of his powers via the chamber.  Since I'm on this topic, also gone are the phony effects Lester used when the Kryptonian villains are freed from the Phantom Zone.  Donner's effects look much better.<br /><br />The encore presentation of the ol' \\"spinning back the world\\" plot device is awkwardly-used and quite unwelcome.  I know the reason it was used here (check out other Amazon reviews for the full story), but the fact remains that it just doesn't work.<br /><br />But lots of other scenes do, even the screen-test version (it's all that exists) of the \\"Lois outing Clark with a revolver\\" sequence.  I also liked Lois' first attempt to out Clark just as the movie opens.  But- as a quick aside- am I the only one who doesn't agree with Richard Donner and his writer on the commentary track that the Paris sequence was terrible and everyone is happy to see it gone here?  I always liked that Paris episode, even though it's nice to see Superman's deflected missile from the first movie now be the thing that's responsible for freeing the Kryptonian villains from the Phantom Zone.<br /><br />Well, enough rambling.  I could go on and on with listing all the differences in the two versions of the film and which changes I liked and which I didn't, but I'll let the other Amazon reviews of this DVD have their turn.  In the end, flaws and all, this is nothing other than a must-buy, or at least a must-see, for Superman fans.  Though the Lester cut still wins out as the more polished satisfying film, this newly-revealed Donner cut contains many individual elements that are stronger than anything in the Lester cut.  It's fun to think, though, what this film could have been if Richard Donner had REALLY got to finish this film way back when.  Now THAT would have been a keeper.ther Amazon reviews for the full story), but the fact remains that it just doesn't work. <br /> <br />But lots of other scenes do, even the screen-test version (it's all that exists) of the \\"Lois outing Clark with a revolver\\" sequence.

B00005YUPO|1.0|I *love* Bach and the music selection for this video is hardly any of the best stuff he composed and so dumbed-down that it's downright bad (maybe it's not dumbed-down and the people who arranged it had a different idea for the figured-bass than most others have seen it but it still isn't appeasing to the ears). Also, like I've said in all my reviews of the composer vids, the timing is off for the vid portion and in a Bach video that's just not good. The Mozart vid is far better music wise but I suggest buying the c.d.s and forgoing the vids for this collection altogether.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|A warning, I'm starting this review before the CD has even finished playing it's virgin run in my CD player. Live albums can be a minefield. Usually the idea of a full length live acoustic set can start as an interesting experiment and quickly descend into a pit of monotony and repetition. If you're the kind of person who is unable to appreciate music unless it's driven solely by fuzzy guitars and fake guttural roaring (E.G. Trivium albums.) you'll hate this. However if you switch onto bands when you hear well constructed songs with nuanced chord structures and lyrics that can swing between riddlous nonsense and emotional nail-on-heads, you'll already know the Foo Fighters. And where as in the past they have followed closer to their hardcore roots, here they show maturity, joy and a fresh voice to present their sublime back catalogue. Skin And Bones, for me, completes my holy trinity of live albums. Started with Frampton Comes Alive (an album so loved I named my MySpace page in it`s honour.) through Jeff Buckley's Mystery White Boy, landing here.  <br />In my review for In Your Honour I criticised the album for being stuck on a creative crossroads between what Grohl's audience were expecting and what his instincts told him mixed with a new road of being in a place of contentment that showed more laid back joy. While this would never be able to be seen as in anyway an apology for the shortcomings of In Your Honour, (nor should it) it does however show a greater risk taken by one of modern music's most influential and best loved figure heads. It also without doubt proves that Grohl has written a song that (as anyone who knows me will have been told ad infinitum) is one of our generations greatest rock songs. This record secures Everlong as worthy of title: Best Ever Rock Songs along side Stairway To Heaven, Bohemian Rhapsody and such like. FACT!  <br />The key to the album's success is suggested in the accompanying sticker on the cover `unique interpretations' since you have songs which fit ultra comfortable in the acoustic setting, such as February Stars, however even still, the songs have been given a breath of life and been reworked so beautifully it sounds like they were written like this, this way, the day before, always feeling spontaneous. And yet somehow familiar. The arrangements are lush and filled with life and an almost country style richness. Other more unusual choices such as Best Of You sound like were in a dark dingy folk club with some young kid wanting to burst with the energy of his love of his rich musical world- Yet another reason why Dave is such a joy to listen to, since as a man approaching his middle ages, an artist who has paid his dues and yet still sings like he's just finally on the cusp of his big break, and has everything to fight for. Every track has something new and interesting about it. My one criticism is that the performance is so accomplished the audience are sent into such a frenzy throughout, their constant whooping can become annoying stepping on my own pet hate, clapping along to songs. Word to every audience: your not helping, the guys on stage got it covered. Having said that, the one most powerful moment on the album is right at the end, the audiences warmth as they support Dave's vocal is the essence of what a live album is for. The very magic that happens in a live performance is so divine your only reaction can be to sing. You cant capture that magic in a studio setting. It's very synergy during Everlong is exactly the reason upon first listen you cant help but be moved to tears, rediscovering it's sensuality. Forever reminding you of your first moment you discovered love, heartbreak and your own strength through your vulnerability.  <br />This is without doubt Foo Fighters best album since The Colour And The Shape. (My number 1 album of all time.) And it is so because the fire in their bellies has been missing since. Always writing fantastic songs. But always seemed as though theywere being recorded for posterity. Here they are alive, like Wind Up and Chicken Derby`s recordings. But here playing newer more mature material. I'd kill to have been there. I'd kill to have them record all their back catalogue like this- just to see what they sound like. How would Aurora have turned out? What about Monkey Wrench? Alone And Easy Target would've bounced along with ease. All just a pretty dream I have. Thank god we got these fifteen tracks, mostly consisting of the second side of In Your Honour. Which is great, it was the better album. Point proved. Next Foo Fighters: The Country Album- I'd buy it. <br />
B000024D4R|2.0|This cd sucks from start to finish for the reason I can't get it out of my head.  I will be in important meetings and I can't get the guitar solos from dogs to stop running through my head.  In fact I can play the whole album/cd from start to finish in my head to a tee.  Thus I can't pay attention to anything being said.   Two stars, well I guess I meant 5.  I feel that this is the Pink Floyd at their best, each song flowing into the next, the best guitar work I feel from Gilmour.  An album with balls, Floyd made this knowing that it would not be getting any radio time at all, no hits.  Yet they released it making the music they wanted to, not caring about critics etc.  If you didn't want to listen to it then they didn't want you too.  The perfect mesh between Waters at the helm of the concept and Gilmour making the music for it.  The way Floyd was supposed to be, at their best. Regarless of what was going on in the band at the time, I feel that musicaly this is at their prime, each member knew their part.  Music before the pre Waters Solo works of The Wall and Final Cut.  And after Wish You Were Here and Darkside  ....what more can I say?  Not only my favourite Floyd album but my favourite album ever, bar none, never gets old always in my cd changer
0060090367|4.0|This book was an excellent read. I picked it up at a discount store thinking it was typical trashy chick-lit. What I found was a book that surprisingly digs into human nature and battles some tough \\"coming to terms with yourself\\" issues. The plot never slows. This is a great read.
B000I0QK74|1.0|I am so , so disappointed in J.T.!  He is my all time favorite but what a trick he played on us!  This is the EXACT album that he issued 2 years ago through Hallmark stores-EXACT-even down to the liner notes. Just put a new title on it. Nasty.  Bought it 2 years ago for a bargain with the purchase of a couple cards.  Paid dearly for it this year because I thought it might be something new from my man.  I am so disappointed :-(  ..shame on you J.T.
1401308201|5.0|I received this book as a gift, and it is truly amazing. The images and illustrations are wonderful, and the text is intelligent, funny, and informative. This is written for the true Wicked fan!
0446528056|1.0|Let me start by saying.... I LOVE NICHOLAS SPARKS.  I was very disappointed in this book.  I thought the charactors were not believable.  The middle of the book was slow, more about the war then the love story.  I give all his books a 5 star, but just not this one.
B000J103X4|5.0|excellent sophomore cd from the game although he does mention dre in every freakin song!!!!!!!!! if you can get past that then it will be a good purchase i really like the songs,( ol english, lookin at you,one blood, compton,wouldnt get far,one night,doctors advocate,and why you hate the game) this overall a pretty solid cd.
B000JBXXZ4|1.0|okay so i used to love them.  but now i think incubus is so bad.  i mean bad. bad bad bad.  this album has a couple of moments where i think they might be okay.  but just okay.  once upon a time i thought they would change the face of rock and roll forever.  but alas, they sucked it up.  i'm so disappointed,  and have been since morning view.  s.c.i.e.n.c.e. is absolutely incredible.  where did they go?
B0001GL3K4|5.0|LOVE this film.  The writers found a way to compose a love story that's not a sappy girl flick and a holiday story that doesn't feebly mimic It's A Wonderful Life.  I love that the relationships presented are realistic and believable, but yet there is a touch of whimsical around the edges to make it enjoyable.  Fantastic.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I just watched the film. It was sitting on my shelf for a long time because I was never in the mood to watch a \\"downer\\". I will dissapoint the reviewer who said there is no middle ground with this film: you either love it or hate it. For me, it was neither. I guess I kind of liked it because I wanted to give my opinion on it. I liked it because I know what addiction is like and this film came closest to what I felt like among the ones that I have seen so far. I didn't like it because it was too repetitive and the characters were kind of loose. Even though I was overly eager to sympathize with them, I just could not.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|If you buy nothing else for yourself this Christmas, be sure and buy Sara's Wintersong.  I am so completely impressed with her work on this.  But more importantly, I'm moved!  When music gives me chills, I know it's good. And this CD did just that.  Beautiful arrangements, heavenly chord changes, Enya-like harmonies....it's just the perfect Christmas CD. She has taken even the traditional songs and made them more beautiful than you could imagine. So go buy it, turn down your lights, turn on the tree lights, queue this up and close your eyes. You're in for a dream!
0767836324|5.0|Dustin Hoffman's performance here gives further credence to his elite and legendary status as the industry's most celebratedely vacuous actor. It puts him in the rarified air that's also occupied by national treasures: Kevin Spacey, Hugh Grant, Tommy Lee Jones and Denzel Washington.<br /><br />This film is also testament to the misunderstood and miscompensated talents of Robin Williams and Steve Spielberg. If there's a lesson here it's that simply putting together an \\"all-star\\" cast guarantees nothing. Julia Roberts is horribly miscast as a nice entity.
6305736650|3.0|A few years ago I read Ingrid Bergman's autobiography, which was fabulous so I began buying alot of her movies, and Casablanca was my least favorite!!! She was simply magnificent in Gaslight, Spellbound, Anastasia, Notorious, and Cactus Flower.    On the other hand I've never understood the mass appeal of Humphrey Bogart??? Although I loved the movies Key Largo(Edward G. Robinson stole the show as Johnny Rocco!), To Have and Have not, and They Drive by Night , they were just great films with or without Bogie! Eventhough Humphrey Bogart was a major movie star, his voice and mannerisms were so distinct that it always seemed like he was just playing the same one- dimensional character in every film.
0156027321|2.0|Despite the talents of Mr. Martel, this is a failed effort, in my opinion. The problems are as follows.<br /><br />First, the total lack of any plot. Indian zoo-owning family leaves old country by ship, ship sinks, boy survives, boy deals with stow-away tiger, boy finds land. End of plot.<br /><br />Second, the absolute, unrelenting, painfully detailed brutality which makes similar survival books pale by comparison. Maybe that's realism, but what a gruesome, ugly, utterly brutal novel.<br /><br />Third, the religious ramblings of the central character are non-conclusive and weak-minded, and do not show any internal struggle or doubt in the face of unimaginable suffering. Just love and faith all the way. How very naive. How totally improbable.<br /><br />I just had to read it because of all the good ratings, and I just had to find out what the hype was all about. I must admit that it was a fast, compulsive read, in spite of the problems. Some parts are actually quite amusing and humorous, but humor is no saving grace in this instance. No re-read for this one.
B000JU7NCE|4.0|Okay, in case you're not a fan, this is the most recent version of the Cure, just Robert Smith, his long-time running mate Simon Gallup on bass, and Jason Cooper on drums, a 12 year veteran.  Joining them for the moment  (and maybe longer it seems) is Porl Thompson on guitar, who hasn't been around since the 90's.  Because these guys know each other and the music so well, there are no rough spots here, this is very familar territory.  Personally I don't think Porl adds that much, his guitar is accomplished, but it lacks a distinctive voice to my ears.  And I really think a keyboard is necessary to fill out the Cure sound.  As a result I think this feels a little spare (they do \\"Plainsong\\" and it sounds okay, but . . . odd).  It does force Bob to play guitar a lot, and that's a good thing, he was handing off a lot to Perry in concert when I saw them last.<br /><br />Other than that, it's just a pure concert piece, very familiar camera angles, not that there's anything wrong with that, I just want to see them play anyway.  But the recording is a little grainy in places, like it was trying for a pixelated special effect look (see the opening frames) and some other silly effects like in \\"Heaven\\", which also make Bob look like a vampire who just lifted something heavy.  It even gets black and white in places.  Compared to the sparkling look of \\"Trilogy\\", this is a real letdown in quality.<br /><br />My final comment is that the setlist is very . . . settled.  I sure would like to see them play something absolutely new some day, why not a Join the Dots concert?  Something like that.  I mean, how many times can you watch Bob do \\"A Forest\\"?  Okay, lots, me too, but a fresh set would be nice (an exception is \\"Push\\", which I've never seen them play).<br /><br />So, I'll give it a 4, because it is the Cure, and there's never enough material as far as I'm concerned, and there's 30 songs here, very generous.  And because this is priced remarkably low, like Trilogy.  That makes up for the $20+ prices on the \\"enhanced\\" CD's, so the ledger's square again.  Thanks Bob.akes up for the $20+ prices on the \\"enhanced\\" CD's, so the ledger's square again.  Thanks Bob.
B00005JPCA|5.0|After the total piece of crap that was Die Another Day, and the three mediocre films preceeding it, I had no hope for the producers to make this film correctly. Ecstatically, I watched this great movie get better and better, and I didn't want to see it end (even if other's find it too long). I'm actually excited about the next one to see what happens... that hasn't happened in the franchise since the sixties! I only hope they stay on track and can give us a few more great movies before they feel obliged to make a gadget CG cartoon for that other audience...
B00000DI06|5.0|I have listened to many other composers' requiems, but this one beats them all.  It is a little unusual to have both English and Latin liturgy in a requiem, but it is entirely appropriate in this case, as it contains the Mass, psalms, and personal prayers to Christ--I thoroughly enjoyed some of the burial service text sang along with the requiem mass.  The Cambridge singers are sublime, and Caroline Ashton's voice (soprano) is perfect. Liner notes containing lyrics and translations are included if you do not speak Latin.  The \\"Sanctus\\" is very unique and much faster-paced than I am used to, with high voices starting and baritones/tenors echoing.  If I have anything to dislike about Rutter's requiem, it is the fact that there is no \\"Dies Irae\\" text at all; they seem to have been replaced by psalms.  However, the excellence of the singers and the great choice of the texts makes up for it very well.
B000I5X81K|4.0|This CD is quite a shift from Josh's previous work, with a mix of lighter, radio-friendly tracks, african-infused a cappella, and a closing song that's a jazz/alternative collaboration with Herbie Hancock. Most of the songs are in Enlish, which will appeal to the less classically-inclined fans, while Josh's vocals are as strong as ever. The opening track \\"Mai\\" sounds like it was written for the opening scene of an epic film (very powerful vocals, great sound). \\"You are loved,\\" \\"February Song,\\" and \\"Now or Never\\" will probably be the most sucessful on popular radion stations, while \\"So She Dances\\" sounds like a new take on mood music from the 1940's ballroom scene. My personal favorites, \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Weeping,\\" both with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, show a verastility of sounds that wasn't present on Josh's earlier albums. Overall, another great CD from Josh.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I am a fan of the Final Fantasy series and this film brought me back to the time I played the Final Fantasy 7 game. It is better than the first Final Fantasy film launched in North America and it was a good move on the part of Square Enix to release this film. <br /> <br />
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Gwen Stefani did it again, this album is amazing! Every song is differnt and unique. It does not sound like \\"Love, Angel, Music, Baby\\" at all or any of her other stuff. The Neptunes produced most of the songs so it has a great beat.
0618680004|5.0|Finally someone who has taken the time to step forward and say what all rational and peaceful people already know, that the basis for all hatred, and conflict on this planet of ours is based on the various packaged fairy tales we have forced down our throats from the time we are born (the fairy tale in question will depend on where you were born of course, funny how the respective deities focus on geographical areas the way they do). <br /> <br />Highly recommended, especially for those who would argue against it!
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|There are a lot of a stories within the super-hero genre about the teen who suddenly comes into their power (the classic example being Spider-Man). That's because, if properly handled, it's a potent idea with huge potential for both angst and humor. In Sky High it's well-handled. <br /> <br />Will Stronghold is the son of the world's two greatest super-heroes, the Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). With a father who's the strongest man on Earth and a mother who can fly at supersonic speeds, great things are expected of Will Stronghold as he lives up to their super-heroic legacy. Problem: at age 14, Will has no super-powers. Maybe he's a late bloomer, maybe he'll never get them. <br /> <br />Will manages to hide this fact until his first day at Sky High, a super-hero prep school. There kids are immediately sorted into two groups, which are very much the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\": those with impressive super-powers are Heroes, all others becomes Sidekicks, or, as they like to call themselves, Hero Support. <br /> <br />Will finds himself very much one of the outs, his friends a boy whose only super-power is he can glow - dimly, a girl shapeshifter whose only alternate shape is a guinea pig, another boy whose power is melting into a puddle of oil, and Will's best friend since first grade, Layla, who actually has a really cool super-power of her own but lands in the Sidekicks simply because, thinking the entire concept of breaking people down into groups is stupid, she refuses to show anyone but Will her power. And then there's Warren Peace aka Hothead, the pyro-kinetic son of a bad guy sent away for life by the Commander. Let's just say that Hothead, when he finally meets Will, has a few issues to work out. <br /> <br />On the other side of the good guy/bad guy Sky High equation we have Lash, a teen jerk Plastic Man; the super-fast bully Speed; the duplicate girl Penny (who is apparently too dim to even come up with a code name - personally, given her personality, I think Bad Penny would be perfect); and a mysterious hooded figure intent on somehow using Will and Sky High in a plot against the Commander and Jetstream. <br /> <br />For all that this is a Disney comedy, it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny. (That's not a complaint, I like that things are played mostly straight.) The exception is Kurt Russell as the Commander. Russell has had such success as a dramatic actor, a lot of people forget he made his mark in Disney comedies, and he's actually a fine comedian with a flair for over-the-top goofiness. The Commander comes across as a bit pompous, not quite the sharpest tool in the shed, but under it all a doting dad who loves his son with all his heart. His scenes with Will are not only funny but genuinely touching. Steve Stronghold is not only the world's most powerful man, he just may be the world's best dad. <br /> <br />The supporting cast in this movie is first rate, especially Bruce Campbell as gym coach Boomer, aka former second rate hero Sonic Boom, and Sky High principal Lynda Carter (who for my money looks even better now that she did 30 years ago as Wonder Woman). <br /> <br />Sky High is like Buffy in that it uses an exaggerated reality (the supernatural, superheroics) as a venue to examine real human problems with which people, especially adolescents, can relate. While Sky High seems on the surface to be a bright, bouncy story of teen super-heroes, it's really about fearing you'll never meet your parents' expectations, of wanting to be part of the in-crowd so badly you turn your back on your friends, of living down bad parents, of falling in love with a friend who doesn't fall back, and more. Okay, it comes apart a bit at the end. As the hooded bad guy's plan is finally revealed, the straight approach goes away and things go over the line into camp. Still, Sky High is well worth watching. It's the freshest Disney comedy in years.

Through a web site, they agree to swap homes for the holidays - Amanda (Cameron Diaz) ends up in a storybook cottage outside London, while Iris (Kate Winslet) finds herself in an L.A. mansion. <br /> <br />The movie unfolds as two movies, cutting back and forth between their stories. Amanda meets Iris's brother, Graham (Jude Law), who turns out to be unexpectingly different than any other man she's ever met. Meanwhile, Iris meets Miles (Jack Black), a funny goofball of a guy who helps Iris lighten up and stop pining for the man who will never love her.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|Eminem started this out as a mixtape but it got good buzz and he decided to release a full album showing off himself, D-12 (even Proof is on here (R.I.P.), 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks, Stat Quo and his new artists Cashis & Bobby Creekwater (like Stat Quo are nothin special) and a cameo by Nate Dogg & Akon.  With 21 songs/freestyles you get a lot of material and a lot from all of the artists involved, 1 classic, 7 ok songs, and the other 13 are good and a few are real good songs.  Production is pretty good and mostly handled by Eminem (10 of the 21 songs), Alchemist does 3, Witt & Pep and Rikanatti each do 2, Dr. Dre, Focus, Disco and Akon all do 1 song.  A nice album to have for fans of the Shady camp. <br /> <br />#2 - 8 (eminem (dissin AZ for some reason as he's one of the best), stat quo, bobby creekwater, cashis) <br />#3 - 8 (obie trice) <br />#4 - 8.5 (bizarre & kuniva) -- nice beat <br />#5 - 7 (cashis) <br />#6 - 7.5 (eminem & 50 cent) <br />#7 - 10 (CLASSIC!! -- 50 cent, eminem, cashis, lloyd banks -- great beat) <br />#8 - 8 (eminem f/ 50 cent) <br />#9 - 9 (proof (R.I.P.) -- 16 bars) <br />#10 - 7 (swifty f/ kon artis) <br />#11 - 7 (cashis) <br />#12 - 6 (stat quo) <br />#13 - 8 (cashis & obie trice) <br />#14 - 8 (bobby creekwater -- nice beat) <br />#15 - 7 (stat quo) <br />#16 - 7.5 (akon f/ stat quo & bobby creewater) <br />#17 - 9 (eminem -- nice beat) <br />#18 - 8.5 (stat quo -- good beat) <br />#19 - 8.5 (50 cent --  remix of his \\"Ski Msk Way\\") <br />#20 - 9 (bobby creekwater, nate dogg, obie trice -- nice beat) <br />#21 - 8 (obie trice, kuniva, cashis, bobby creekwater, stat quo) <br />#22 - 9 (eminem) <br /> <br />Check all my reviews
B000J10ERO|5.0|At first i was doubtful and the newcomer Brandon Routh being superman but i must say he proved himself worthy to put on the cape. The film itself was well casted, some were better than previous ones i thought. Kevin Spacey i thought played a more serious and ruthless lex luthor than Gene Hackman did. Kate Bosworth herself played a better lois lane who seemed more serious at her job and smarter aswell as beautiful. Frank Langella played a good perry white as Jason Marsden played his nephew. though Marc Mcclure i liked better, Sam Huntington did a decent job. Now for the things i didnt much like in this installment. I didnt care much for the new superman costume design. If this film is to take place after the first two christopher reeve films, why change the design? the colors and material didnt bother me that much, but i thought it would be better if they stuck with the previous design, having the bigger chest S symbol aswell as the yellow S symbol on the cape. Keeping the cape little shorter and not change the belt buckle or boots. i asked numberous of people what they thought and they agreed to keep the color and material but not use the new design. I mean come on, no-one in their right mind is gonna think of superman being a real person. Bryan Singer did a good job though on this movie still as he did with the first two x-men films,the  <br />plot was decent for a larger scale plan thats been already done. superman having a kid i thought wasnt too bad, would make sense after what he and lois did in superman 2. but overall i give this a five star sense it earned its place in the franchise. thats all i gotta comment. and id like to think i speak for everyone, but we miss you Christopher Reeve as the world needs and still wants a real-life superman. god bless ya and your wife.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I'd heard a bit about the 1927 film Metropolis from a couple of sci-fi documentaries. Apparently its potrayal of a futuristic city has been pretty influential in science-fiction films. They are some signficant shots of the city, I do agree, but there's plenty of other things about this German silent film to like too.<br /><br />The city of Metropolis is a sophisticated place, full of traffic, skyscrapers and aeroplanes. The people above the ground have a pretty relaxed lifestyle, while the city of workers underground put in all the hard work maintaining the generators and the like. Freder Fredersen is one of the above ground citizens, son of the metropolis leader Joh Fredersen. He is drawn to the underground by a woman named Maria, who invites him to come see his \\"brothers\\". Maria is a teacher, who calms the workers frustrations and asks them to be patient, encouraging them to wait for the day when a mediator will come and heal the rift between the \\"mind\\" of Metropolis and the \\"hands\\". It is a visit that changes Freder's life and melts his heart, for he falls in love with Maria and finds compassion for the workers. Meanwhile, a scientist under Joh Fredersen's employ has created a robot in man's likeness, one that can realistically take on the form of a human being. They get the robot to take the form of Maria, and send it underground to stir up the workers, hoping this will bring them more into line. But things don't go as planned, and soon both worlds are stirred...<br /><br />Being a lengthy silent film, there's a lot of time and space to soak up director Fritz Lang's world, which I really appreciated. Though it's a film from 1920s Germany (not a time known for its wealth), it feels surprisingly high budget, with a large cast of extras, big sets, and significant special effects. Even eighty years on, I think the robot, as well as the way it wears its human form, is pretty creepy. I love the lighting as well. There's actually a lot going on thematically in \\"Metropolis\\", and though some of the imagery and allusions here and there are curious choices, I do like the message of the film, that thoughts and actions, be they of an individual or of a society, work together best when mediated by a heart.<br /><br />Recommended for thoughtful sci-fi fans.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|A master's work. <br /> <br />The best song on all three disks is definitively Born To Run. <br />There is none other. <br /> <br />However, I think that Springsteen's live work is much <br />more spectacular.
0141301074|5.0|A fun introduction to dark humour for kids. While it sets an example of everything a relationship should NOT be, I have to admit it was sort of funny to observe the bodily humour and laugh at the two very disturbed anti-heroes. If I were to have a child read this, I would probably insist on doing it With them as opposed to having it read it alone without a few comments here and there about how this is no way to behave in real life. That way, its mischief might be mitigated by a little reality...not to spoil the fun, of course, but just in case the child is too young to recognize sarcasm--and it makes a GREAT read-aloud. Anyhow, it's fun, crude, and silly like much of Dahl's work. <br /> <br />In The Twits we see the daily lives of the two most horrible, dirty, ugly, and mean people in town. They are a married couple who do anything and everything to hurt and annoy one another, and when not bothering one another, torture a family of monkeys by training them to be a circus act. Their favorite food is bird pie, which they make by catching birds in trees by using paste on the branches. PLOT SPOILER: The monkeys turn the tables and defeat their owners who, by being pasted to the floor upside-down, collapse into themselves until they disappear forever.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen Stefani is nothing if not adventurous.  \\"The Sweet Escape\\" once again finds Stefani trying on lots of pairs of musical shoes to present a disc as eclectic as \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby.\\"  It would be a perfect album, and possibly a masterpiece, for someone whose motto is: \\"I love all kinds of music (aside from K-Fed, Paris Hilton, and car-ad extraordinaire Taylor Hicks).\\"  But for those, such as my myself, who have more narrowly defined tastes, the disc will prompt a lot of presses on the skip button.  For those who like what the Neptunes bring, their production comprises nearly half the album.  Throw in the Swizz Beatz, and you pretty much know how half the album should sound.  80s New Wave/Dance and 90s Alt-Rock enthusiasts should love the other half.  If you loved \\"L.A.M.B.\\"'s New Order-alike \\"The Real Thing\\" with Bernard Summer and Peter Hook on board, the new album recruits Martin Gore for the Depeche Mode-alike \\"Wonderful Life.\\"  Those who have fond memories of Prince-produced female acts like Vanity 6 should take a shine to the synth, horn, and heavy-breathing-heavy \\"Flourescent.\\"  The title track is indeed an escape back to her ska roots, which jauntily marches on like Madness.  Downbeat 90s midtempo alt-rock is represented here with the Wallflowers-ish (though backed with Human League-like synths) \\"Early Winter.\\"  \\"4 in the Morning\\" almost sounds like an alternate take of \\"The Real Thing\\" (no complaints here).  In other words, all the things you either loved or hated about \\"L.A.M.B.\\" are all in place here...once again making pick-and-choose downloadable music sites indispensable.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This is a great story about a brilliant young girl who overcomes the cruelty of a family that does not treat her as she deserves. The villains are her parents and her teacher, Mrs Trunchbull. With the help of the kind teacher, Ms Honey, and her own magical powers, she manages to get adopted by her mentor and get rid of the villainous teacher who killed Ms Honey's parents. Not only does the book make some interesting statements about education and family, but the strong female protagonist is a neat role model for young girls. I loved it as a kid, and still appreciate it a great deal; also, the film version captures the imagery and intent nicely. <br /> <br />As for the widescreen issue, it's a shame. It could have been kept the way we saw it in theatres...oh well.
B00003CX96|5.0|Were scenes added to the DVD.  If yes, what scenes?  For example, did Dave ever talk to Katarina after she slapped him, in the original release?
0141304642|5.0|Esio Trot is a love story about a man, a woman, and a tortoise. The leading lady of the story has an obsession with her 11-year-old turtle, who as she claims, has a growing problem. Miss Silver's Neighbor, Mr. Hoppy, finds a way to make the turtle grow (by swapping him for increasingly larger turtles), thus winning her heart. This is one of the few books written by Dahl that doesn't really use the usual vile and icky humor. He must have been feeling romantic. It is very charming, and very cute.
0451167716|5.0|We think The Godfather was a excellent book we enjoyed the way  <br />Mario Puzo describes every scene with numerous details. We also enjoyed how Mario Puzo describes all the characters. The book is full of crime, love, passion, action, and tragedy. We were also delighted by the way Mario Puzo jumps from one scene to another in each chapter. The Godfather is a book you never want to put down once you start reading the first page. <br />

0141301104|5.0|This is a neat, modern, fairy-tale about a boy and his grandmother's adventures identifying and eliminating witches. I enjoyed it as a child, as well as more recently. The story is exciting and the imagery is, as with all of Dahl's works, grotesque but incredibly appealing, especially for kids. <br /> <br />This book has been accused of many things, ranging from Satanic content to anti-feminist rhetoric. It may be wholly gruesome, and the witches may all be female, as all witches are (according to the book), but I never quite got that impression by reading the book. For the people fearing that their children will want to pursue witchcraft, I would reply that that would mean their kids want to be bald with deformed fingers, have their peers all smell like feces, have square toe-less feet, and behave as the witches in this story behave.  <br /> <br />When Dahl picks a villain, he leaves no room for sympathy, and even less for admiration. As for the anti-feminism, the protagonist's savior and mentor is his grandmother, who is strong, feisty, and clever. She is modeled after Dahl's mother, for whom he had great respect, and helps offset the negativity toward the witches. The plot is fairly simple, but there are some very poignant moments between this boy and his grandmother. While the ending is a little bittersweet, it is still touching and leaves the reader feeling warm and safe.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This album is why I love AC/DC. It seems to me that a lot of their records have great songs but it really depends on what a person connects with first by them in terms of style for what they consider their favorite. So if you started with High Voltage and fell in love, your obviously not gonna be that wild about their evolved sounds on Highway to Hell and Back and Black. Or maybe your smarter then that and love them all. I guess I do love all their albums, but this one really introduced me to their raw energy, and on this album it's just non-stop. One reason I like it better then Back in Black is because it's more focused on hard rock then blues which I personally like when it comes to mixing the two genres. On this album a couple songs even...gasp...have some tinges of punk rock. Now come on, how can you listen to Beating Around the Bush, Walk all Over You, or If You Want Blood and say that the speed and ferocity of punk didn't have any influence on them at all in the late seventies. Well anyway, every song on this album rocks hard and that's why I love it. Oh and by the way Bon Scott is at his best here. You can really tell the difference in the passion, energy and sheer volume of his voice on this compared to other AC/DC of the time such as Powerage or Dirty Deeds. The whole record in fact is maxed in volume and rage. So get the album, it's the apex of their hard rock style in the seventies before they went more blues rock and hopefully you wont be dissapointed with bare bones AC/DC.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Aside from \\"Wind It Up\\", this album, as much as it hurts me to say this, is horrible. I think what defines Gwen is her voice and in this album it is completely lost.
B000002MJC|5.0|This album is excellent, lots of good reviews so mine will be about one song from the album, Mercy in You. This song for me, has been what DM has meant to me over the years.<br /><br />I would lose my way again<br /><br />Be led hopelessly astray again<br /><br />Just so I could pray again<br /><br />For the mercy in you<br /><br />These words are such a strong statement to do wrong, to do bad, if only for the forgiveness that is offered, to return again. This has been for me a taunting of religion, of sin and how foolish and at the same time rewarding the whole process is. Alot of events in the lives of DM happened after this album and Ultra was released with the abscense of Wilder.
B00005JPC4|5.0|I agree completely with \\"Damian.\\" I don't understand all the bad reviews either. No point going over the plot again, you can read about it in several other reviews, but I saw it twice in the theater and it made me happy and relaxed. Of course it's not high drama or great literature, but it's certainly a nice respite after \\"The Fountain.\\" And you have to laugh at the \\"Lance Armstrong\\" reference. Come on, people, lighten up out there!! Let's leave some room for these kinds of movies too.
B000L7Q4BQ|5.0|This book was histarical!  I loved his stories.  It was easy to follow, since each section was its own story, so you wouldn't have to have listened to one story for the other to make sense, yet it all flowed nicely.  It was one of those books that I was actually really sad when it ended and almost wanted to read it again.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I just purchased this cd last night and I listened to it all day today. I couldn't get enough of it. Gwen is fantastic! She's like a fine wine... she just keeps getting better and better with time. Her last cd, Love, Angel, Music, Baby (LAMB) was awesome and this one is just as great, if not better. I love that her songs are always different. It keeps your interest and attention. The best! I highly recommend this : )
B000J10ERO|3.0|Hmmmm...Brandon Routh to Christopher Reeve -- Brandon admirable job that would have made Christopher Reeve smile.  Kevin Spacey to Gene Hackman, Kevin lacked the personality and flair of Gene, but he was more evil as he and his cohorts kicked Superman when he was down (A brutal image).  Kate to Margot, sorry, no comparison here, Margot was Lois (intelligent, sophisticated yet crass, sexy (and not a mom), assertive that characterized the traits of a real go-getting journalist).  So what we have is the constant comparison of a lesser movie to the pinnacle of all Super Hero movies.  It can't be helped as the Original Superman topped all accounts of previous Supermen, and it appears future Supermen.  Now, how does Superman Returns fare on its own?  We have some rehashing and incorporated bits of the best movie into this one to help it along (Jor-El sequences, etc.).  There are a couple of great action sequences with Superman's actual return, and the Climax, but the rest of the movie is pretty dull.  Characters are not developed, there is little story, and the Man of Steel does a lot of soul searching.  And, when Superman gets ill from Kryptonite poisoning, I was having flashbacks to Superman IV and the Radiation poisoning until miraculous recovery (very similar poisonings). Too bad computer imagery couldn't have dropped Richard Pryor into the city for a cameo, it might have at least made me wake up in the middle of the film.
0671799320|5.0|To call the oil industry a business simply does not do it justice. When I worked in consulting, it was always my favorite area of work simply because of the importance and complexity of the issues involved.<br /><br />Yergin does an amazing job of tracing the political, geographic, military, and economic impact of this critical resource. Weighing in at 788 pages, it is amazingly complete. I was impressed by both the breadth and depth of the material covered. Yergin is also a very good writer. He uses enough anecdote to make the material readable without reducing the weight or the substantial feeling of the work. My only regret was that he hasn't updated the book. I would be fascinated to know what Yergin would make of post-9/11 world events.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in the impact that natural resource and industry can have on geopolitics. Obviously also recommended for anyone with an interest in the history of oil.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|A common criticism reviewers have made of this movie is that the plot is either too hard to follow or it does not make sense.  Not all storytelling is designed to have a linear, easy to understand plot.  The plot was complex, but not impossible to follow.  This movie is also an exercise in giving us glimpses of worlds that are more complex than we probably initially understand.  And the movie asks:  How should we respond to things that are both foreign and violent to us?<br /><br />The movie reminds us there are real, violent wars going on throughout the world right now.  It does not benefit a person to pretend they are not going on.  But as individuals, we can choose how to \\"fight\\" in these conflicts.  We can, as the characters in this film, channel 'good intentions' into violence, misinformation, boundaries, and silence in order to promote our positions.  Or we can, as the filmmakers and actors in this film, use sharing information, artistic expression, & filmmaking to illustrate the problems created by violence, misinformation, boundaries and silence.<br /><br />\\"You're a good man . . . your entire career you've been used.  And probably never even known what for,\\" Christopher Plummer's character says to George Clooney's character, a CIA soldier.<br /><br />There is a scene in this movie where a car drives through a Beirut suburb.  It shows gunmen posted on rooftops every few blocks.  It's important to remember that as boundaries grow, more men are needed to \\"guard\\" those boundaries.  Guards have little time to use their creative skills or craft solutions.  To enable real, long term solutions, we need innovative ideas & non-discriminatory policies that encourage mechanical and social engineers, and lessen the need for boundaries and security guards.<br /><br />For all the movie's plot complexity, it's moral message focuses primarily on the problem side of the equation, suggesting that the pursuit and control of oil makes us bad.  To avoid conceding we need oil is probably as misguided as avoiding conceding there are constant battles being fought to control it.  What the movie does not do well is to show workable diplomatic, governmental, systemic, and alternate energy suggestions for solving the problems inherent in any competition for a limited resource.  We need more than Matt Damon drawing the shortest distance between 2 points in the sand, and the prince monologuing about what he'd like to do, but hypocritically does not do.<br /><br />A key to bringing peace out of any conflict is to remove the scarcity by creating alternate energy sources, improving sharing efficiencies, or reducing consumption.  We need brilliant filmmakers, economists, social scientists, and engineers to take the next steps and suggest practical energy solutions.  In the long run, that will do far more towards creating world peace than old policies that call for more gunmen standing around.  I'd like to see an equally good film on that side of the problem solving equation.  It would be a more difficult film to make than a film that mainly explains the causes of the problems, but it would be a worthwhile film to make.oil is probably as misguided as avoiding conceding there are constant battles being fought to control it.

Too bad the same can't be said of Ross' sad attempts in the flop miniseries, \\"Band of Brothers.\\" More like \\"Bland ...

B00003CWPL|1.0|saw this dog in Harvard Square, at which time Dave was being lauded as a new cinematic genius too deep for ordinary fools to appreciate (classical Harvard dogma).   The \\"Disaster That Was Dune\\" sums him up well enough; it was visually sharp, but utterly dead on the screen, as he seems to have an extremely tenuous grasp of what a human personality is.  Having been thus mugged twice, I gave his television series a pass, which apparently was a surreal (what else?) soap opera that Was embraced by the aforementioned fools. Oh, yes, He did manage to sustain contact with earth long enough to direct Blue Velvet, which Was well done.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This album is great,My FAVORITE ever!<br /><br />I have NEVER had an album where I love every single song like this one.<br /><br />This is my FAVORITE band,my FAVORITE album,The BEST there is period!
B000I5X824|4.0|Staind is definitely one of the best and most important bands in modern rock music. I've been a fan since '99 and have every album (including the out-of-print \\"Tormented\\" album). Any way, the band is about to take a year or 2 off since they've been recording and touring non-stop for 10 years. AND after only 5 albums, they already have a rather large bundle of hits and singles under their belt, so it makes since that they would release a \\"best of\\" compilation just in time for Christmas. Now normally when a band releases a compilation album, they might title it \\"The Best Of\\" or \\"Greatest Hits\\" which would suggest that only the biggest hit songs will be on there. But this collection is titled \\"The Singles: 1996-2006\\", so I would expect that every single would be accounted for. Sadly, a few singles and 1 big hit are missing from this collection.<br /><br />First, let's start with what the album DOES have to offer. It begins with a remix of \\"Come Again\\" which was originally on the band's independently released \\"Tormented\\" album from 1996. It's cool to here if you don't own the album or if you wanna hear a slightly different version of one of the songs from that CD. Next, you have \\"Mudshovel\\" (the band's first big hit) and \\"Home\\" from their 1999 album, \\"Dysfunction.\\" These are great songs, and you're certain to enjoy these tunes from the darker side of Staind. Then the popular \\"Break The Cycle\\" album from 2001 is represented with hit songs like \\"It's Been Awhile\\", \\"For You\\" and \\"Epiphany.\\" There's also the popular acoustic version of \\"Outside\\" that lead singer Aaron Lewis performed with Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit during the 1999 Family Values Tour. Then, from 2003's \\"14 Shades Of Grey\\" you'll find songs like \\"Price To Play\\", \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Zoe Jane\\" (which is a good song but I was never aware that it was a single.) Finally, last year's \\"Chapter V\\" album is represented with \\"Right Here\\", \\"Falling\\" and an acoustic version of \\"Everything Changes\\". However, the CD doesn't end there! For those hardcore Staind fans who already own all the albums, you'll get some bonus acoustic cover songs on here...\\"Comfortably Numb\\" (Pink Floyd), \\"Sober\\" (Tool) and \\"Nutshell\\" (my favorite Alice In Chains tune). These are very good acoustic covers, especially \\"Nutshell\\". They make the album worth getting if you already own everything else.<br /><br />Now it's time to go over what this CD is lacking. First, \\"Just Go\\" from the Dysfunction album is no where to be found. It wasn't a big hit, but I do believe it got some radio play and may have even been the first single from that album...good song. Then from Break The Cycle, we don't have \\"Fade\\" (a VERY big hit for the band) or the studio version of \\"Outside\\" (which was equally as popular as the live acoustic version found on here). Next, missing from 14 Shades Of Grey is \\"How About You\\", which wasn't a big hit but it got radio play and just happened to be my favorite song from that album. And from Chapter V, they decided to put an acoustic version of \\"Everything Changes\\" on here rather than the studio version that was played on the radio. But I suppose this version is just as good.<br /><br />So yes, this album is missing quite a bit, but only 1 or 2 major songs aren't found on here. It's still a nice compilation, especially for the bonus songs. As a Staind fan, I have to be honest that some of the band's best stuff never went to radio. I think after \\"Its Been Awhile\\" became such a huge hit, the record company kept forcing out slow ballads like \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Right Here\\" in order to recapture that success (which may have worked). But I think it's too bad that Staind's REAL style (angsty hard rock) is barely shown on here. This album is a good introduction to the band, but it's mostly meant for the people that just follow whatever they hear on the radio. If you wanna hear some of Staind's BEST stuff, listen to their individual albums to here great songs like \\"Suffocate\\", \\"Crawl\\", \\"Pressure\\", \\"How AboutYou\\", \\"Paper Jesus\\" and \\"King Of All Excuses\\".esus\\" and \\"King Of All Excuses\\".
1570425671|5.0|A couple stories are a little dark, but it's not a dark book. It's just hilarious. The stories are short, so if you don't like the one involving the baby in the clothes dryer, skip it and go straight to the critic's review of the school Christmas play, or the tale of rich neighbors taking their consumer competitiveness to new heights. <br /> <br />Reading this in December is one of my favorite holiday traditions.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I just watched this movie and was very moved by the story. The story is very close to real life of the \\"drug cartel\\" as well as the user and drug enforcerment. What I really liked about this movie is the honesty that is protrayed in all aspects of drugs itself. What the drug does for a person, how it comes in to this country and other countries, also how it is acquired by the user. The honesty includes those that are from the underprivilaged comunities to the \\"silver spoon\\" communities as well. Bravo to the writer and the director of this movie!!! I recommend this movie HIGHLY!!!
0743298020|3.0|At the start of the book, I was thinking that this was the best book that I have read in years. <br /> <br />However shortly after it began, it became a disappointment.     <br /> <br />I will say that the author has a knack for the written word. She shows promise.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|First off, my initial review was not posted here...maybe it's because it had an F-bomb in response to the reviewer who got all patriotic, putting down the genius Dixie Chicks and calling Gwen a \\"true American diva\\"???  Not that it's a bad thing, but how then do you explain Gwen's marriage to Gavin Rossdale, a Brit, and G+G maintaining homes in both London and LA??  Just food for thought...now, on to \\"The Sweet Escape\\"...<br /><br />Having lived with this record since the day of release, I really enjoy it!!!  No, it's not album of the YEAR, not quite, but it's totally likable.  I wasn't as keen on 2 songs, \\"Orange County Girl\\" and \\"Now That You Got It\\", both weak links and the album's only true stabs at modern-day hiphop...both are in the weaker first half of the disc, but it also has 3 of the best tracks, the groovy title track, the gorgeous \\"Early Winter\\" (written with Tim Rice-Oxley from great UK piano rock band Keane) and the lovely \\"4 In The Morning\\" (produced and co-written by Gwen's No Doubt bandmate/ex Tony Kanal).  I do like the single \\"Wind It Up\\", even though it's a tad gimmicky, as it reminds me of the 1986 one-hit wonder yodelling euro dance track \\"Bring Me Edelweiss\\" by Edelweiss (sampling a melody by \\"SOS\\" by ABBA).  Overall, the second half is better, with my fave song here, \\"Yummy\\", with a minimal musical backdrop reminiscent of 80s dance classic \\"White Horse\\" by Laid Back, and second fave, the Linda Perry co-pen \\"Wonderful Life\\", featuring Martin Gore from Depeche Mode on guitar and backing vocals...the song shares a vibe and title with one of my fave 80s songs by Black, from 1987, awesome!!!  The whole second half is strong, through and through.  I would have preferred \\"L.A.M.B.\\" to have a similar feel like this record and more like that album's high points like the singles \\"What You Waiting For\\", \\"Cool\\" and \\"Crash\\", as well as non-singles like \\"The Real Thing\\" (her genius collaboration with Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook from New Order & Joy Division...and her husband in the writing), and the Tony Kanal co-pen & production \\"Danger Zone\\", which all got overlooked in favour of the R&B/hiphop ones, a disappointment for me.<br /><br />\\"The Sweet Escape\\" has some VERY strong singles, which should become big hits, and I'm happy with the record overall.  I've noticed MANY harsh reviews of the album here.  It's probably because those people don't have a feel for REAL 80s new wave, just hiphop and R&B.  Then again, \\"L.A.M.B.\\" had a strong R&B/hiphop flavour which translated in a couple of top 10 hits in \\"Rich Girl\\" and \\"Hollaback Girl\\", and a lesser hit in the Isley's-sampling \\"Luxurious\\".  This record has practically NONE of that here, just in the weaker 2 songs, and the rest blended better within the overall sound, like a smoothie, harking back to the early 80s when electro new wave and R&B/hiphop blended together, in records, in the clubs, on the radio and on the charts, when there was much more crossover back and forth, as when New Order and Depeche Mode records would hit the club and R&B charts and be played on urban stations like NYC's WBLS and Gwen Guthrie & Grace Jones, and even Prince was played on New Wave radio like LI's WLIR and be played in the new wave dance clubs.  What a great era!!!<br /><br />Many of today's kids and R&B/hiphop listeners don't \\"get\\" that, based on their harsh reviews of \\"The Sweet Escape\\"...in time, MAYBE they will come around and this record will grow on them.sion...and her husband in the writing), and the Tony Kanal co-pen & production \\"Danger Zone\\", which all got overlooked in favour of the R&B/hiphop ones, a disappointment for me. <br /> <br />\\"The Sweet Escape\\" has some VERY strong singles, which should become big hits, and I'm happy with the record overall.

0060837020|5.0|I think the reason why a lot of people haven't taken to her writing style is because you have to keep in mind that Sylvia Plath was, first and foremost, a poet - not a novelist. There is an honesty and poetic quality that embodies every single word of this book. This is not a book that was written to make people feel sorry for her and if you met Esther Greenwood in real life you may not even like her, but one thing you do come away with after reading this book is an understanding of how a person can go from functional to suicidal in a matter of days.  <br /> <br />It's hard to understand under what conditions a person could commit suicide if you have never attempted it yourself (I never have.) And if you can't understand, you can't appreciate how real a suicidal person's feelings are. In this book, Sylvia lays out her feelings and thoughts with such honesty and poignancy that it literally becomes painful to imagine her suffering. <br /> <br />Besides suicide, the other major issue covered in this book is the feminist double-standard. Why is it that men who sleep with many women are congratulated and women who sleep with many men are socially chastised? She touches on this subject through her encounters with men. You can feel her frustration and anger with the double-standard and you know (knowing what is to come later on in the book) that this only exacerbates her feelings of hopelessness. <br /> <br />It's sad that poets are so underappreciated in our society. Overall, this is one of the best books written... ever. Poets write great prose because they see beauty and sadness where others see ordinary. Then they translate this to the written word and it becomes a glorious celebration of language.
B000I5X80G|3.0|Since other reviewers have delved into specifics regarding which songs were played at the Fillmore and which should have been included, I'm not going to reiterate those details. Suffice to say that songs ranging from the classic (\\"The Loner,\\" \\"Cinnamon Girl\\") to the more obscure (some Buffalo Springfield tracks), have been left off this recording. Reprise is lucky that they don't have an army of disgruntled Neil Young devotees storming their offices. But has anyone considered that their frustration could be misguided?    Actually, from what I hear, Neil Young himself is behind the release of this album, and he's planning on going through his archives personally to determine what should be released. And yes, I've heard that some songs, at least \\"Cinnamon Girl,\\" no longer existed on high-quality tape. The emphasis here was clearly on giving people the best sounding material. And yes, that's admirable, but let's face it - there aren't many people out there who are going to buy this except the big fans, the ones who already have Live Rust and Weld, the ones who own all the original albums, the ones who have been begging for the release of a full show by Neil Young and Crazy Horse circa Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, while Danny Whitten was still alive. And this just doesn't cut it.     Regardless of the controversy surrounding Live at the Fillmore East, what's here is very, very good. \\"Down by the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" are astounding, revealing the tremendous skill of both Young and Whitten, while the shorter songs show the loose genius of Neil and the band. \\"Wonderin'\\" is an excellent version of the tune later revamped for Everybody's Rockin' in rockabilly form, and I particularly like \\"Winterlong.\\" If you're a huge fan of Neil Young and Crazy Horse, by all means, pick this one up. Just know that this is going to feel like something of a missed opportunity.     By the way, I don't understand why one reviewer distinguished between Neil Young and Miles Davison the basis of race - is that bigotry against a white musician? The two play different styles, on different instruments, with different intentions. Why in God's name does it matter which one was black and which one was white? They were/are both tremendously talented musicians, and that's why I like them both; not because of their skin color.
B00005JPBP|5.0|`The Prestige' marks one of the finest films I've seen this year, complete in every sense of the word.  It's dark and mysterious and funny and strange and eerie and disturbing and thought provoking and engaging and unique in everyway possible.  From star performances by Christian Bale, High Jackman and Michael Caine as well as titillating eye candy in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo, `The Prestige' enlists an all star cast to help tell the twisted story of two rival magicians bound together by a tragic event that haunts their every action. <br /> <br />When Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) accidentally causes the death of Robert Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife Julia (Piper Perabo) not only is their friendship instantly over but they are now rivals, in every aspect of their lives.  The film begins with the death of Robert Angier at the supposed hands of Alfred Bordon.  As we await the result of the trial we are given, in flashbacks, the events that preceded the murder.  Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career highpoints here, adding layers upon layers to their characters and giving us, the viewer, every reason in the world to sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br />I don't want to give any of this movie away so I don't want to write too much.  This film is utterly brilliant and one that is sure to please.  I myself was utterly impressed with every second of this film and am positive that you will be as well.  There has been much mention of the twists and turns this film takes and the surprise ending, just note that you may think you know, even I thought I knew, but I really had no idea.  Excellent, excellent film!
032147404X|5.0|I have written seven books and dozens of articles about teaching, self-defense, martial arts, and related subjects. After spending thousands of dollars hiring professional photographers to illustrate my works I finally decided that I'd be best off taking the pictures myself. The challenge was that I had no idea how to go about doing that. After reading this outstanding book, I not only know how to take my own professional-quality pictures but can do so time after time.<br /><br />Kelby's advice is straightforward, painless to read, easy to understand, and immensely practical. No technical jargon and complicated explanations here, just simple, trouble-free guidance that anyone can take advantage of. I purchased this book for less than $12 and have already saved more than $12,500 in photographer fees. I am hugely grateful for this fine work!<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Blinded by the Night, among other titles

B000F7CMRM|5.0|This movie is exceptional in its portrayal of the beauty, reality and sporadic chaos of the Middle East. And it's not the first movie to deal with western corruption! Amazon reviews are an open forum but I'm still bemused by the politically motivated reviews to be found here.<br /><br />If you can't accept the reality that large corporations and governments heavily influence the region, then don't watch this movie.
032147404X|5.0|What an outstanding book!!  Each page teaches a photography tip and illustrates it with a picture.  Explanations are simple to understand and the techniques are very cool.  The book also provides unbiased recommendations for photo equipment such as tripods.  After researching tripods online I ended up buying what the author suggested.   <br /> <br />This book is not written in tech speak (that's what everyone loves about it).  So, you will learn how to take great pictures without reading about aperture, f-stops, etc...  But having some prior knowledge about these photography basics will make your pictures more professional and will help you take better advantage of the tips given in this book.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This film was highly entertaining, filled with lots of action and excellent special effects, although I suspect budgetary limitations kept them from representing the armor suits and some alien landscapes.  The actors are well cast and effectively breath life into purposefully cliched war-movie stereotypes.  They make you care about the characters, giving meaning to the ensuing carnage.  Also, ignore criticism of the FX, the bugs in particular were very realistic. <br /> <br />There seems to be some confusion amongst these reviews about the philosphy represented in this film.  Some seem to think the movie is disparaging fascism.  Others seem to think it is promoting war-mongering.  Yet others feel it has no philosophical content.  Where to begin.... <br /> <br />First, though the film depicts the soldiers often dressed like nazis, remember, nazis were actually socialists (though europeans at that time despised outright communists).  The government of the Earth as depicted in this film (and Heinlein's novel of the same name) is actually a democracy where citizens EARN their right to vote.  Heinlein apparently modeled this upon the ancient greek polis of Athens, as his first little reference to historical soldiers which precedes each of the chapters in his book features ancient greek hoplites.  My understanding is that the reason this book was so controversial is that Heinlein, an ex-marine, was seriously proposing such a government as ideal, and if you read his book, it is one long argument for such.  Not a bad idea, really.  I've often wondered why the vote of some able-bodied loser who has never contributed to the tax base should be equal to, and thus be able to cancel out, the vote of an Iraq veteran who put his life on the line for this country. <br /> <br />I've watched this movie several times and still feel that it was also expressing this (although the accent is definitely on the action).  Verhoeven's other films bear this out, I think.  People thinking it issatirizing fascism haven't looked deeply into what's going on in the film. As for an anti-war message because of the gore, again no.  Verhoeven's other films are quite violent.  I think he is saying that yes, war is horrible, but the brave do what they must.  Frankly, I think that if one has no argument against a particular war other than that war is horrible in general, then he simply has no argument.  As to Verhoeven's remarks about his \\"satirizing\\", I think that the Hollywood political correctness machine put the pressure on him.  I mean, has he done anything significant since this movie?  Though this movie doesn't delve deeply into the political concepts of the book, it still unfolds from those viewpoints and people who think it is deriding those concepts may be overreacting to the satirical moments in it. <br /> <br />Bottom line, just enjoy it for what it is, a sci-fi updating of an old-fashioned war movie, complete with a kind of nationalism. <br /> <br />
0618680004|5.0|At the turn of the 21st century religious intolerance has taken a front row seat, so it is only natural for professed atheists to come out swinging at any and all organized religions. But the thesis' flaw is that Dawkins assumes that everyone who believes is a member of an intolerant fundementalist sect. Of course that is so far from the truth that the message is just a volume of fictive musings by someone who doesn't have the self discipline to study the origins and meaning behind the simplist of all \\"religious\\" beliefs, a sense of spirtuality that exists in everyone that there is more than just the physical world that guides human existence. Science and religion can and does exist together and with the pretense of intellectual dishonesty that is at the core of \\"alleged\\" atheists, and even more cowardly, \\"Agnostics\\". Few really see God's work personally, but everyday we witness the existence in the vastness of the universe that extends beyond even the most fundememntal scientific theory. <br />I completely enjoyed reading this volume for its abundance of pretentious superiority couched in unprovable hypothesis, exactly like fundemental, intollerant religions that are in fact devoid of true spirituality and faith. Religious fanatics use their professed religions to justify their lack of humanity and varying levels of pure Satanic evil.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power. The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words. The action of the film is then not that important since it is nothing but rotten cops and rotten gangsters that are trying to infiltrate their respective sides incognito of even the people on their own sides. We are the only people to know who is a mole and who is not, and yet, even so, Scorcese manages to bring a final mole out of the woodwork in the last two minutes of the film. And is the police mole infiltrated among the gangsters really better than the others ? Maybe yes, but it is so tenuous and brittle an impression that we could doubt it. The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations. Nicholson is not abandoning himself to his traditional ticks and habits. Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful. Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard. And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face. Apart from that it is quite obvious that Scorcese must have found some tremendous enjoyment in directing three men in that dramatic and tragic situation. No film is wasted on any sentimentalese mash. It is all raw granite and solid quartz.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnesituation.

B00005JPCA|5.0|Two kills, and James Bond (Craig) has been elevated to double-O level.  M (Dench) feels that he is not ready, sends him on his first mission anyway.  His job is to find Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen), a supplier of terrorist money, and shut him down.  When Le Chiffre enters an exclusive poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro, Bond enters as well to prevent him from winning.  Even with the help of Vesper Lynd (Green), a treasury agent, Bond may have his hands full, as Le Chiffre sets his eyes on removing Bond from the picture permanently.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is a successful reboot of the James Bond franchise.  As different as night and day from \\"Die Another Day\\", \\"Casino Royale\\" does almost everything right.  Daniel Craig is perfect as Bond, maybe even the best ever.  He is a rough around the edges \\"blunt instrument\\" that has a ways to go before he is the James Bond we know.  Grounded in reality, \\"Casino Royale\\" also does away with most of the gadgets one would expect from a Bond movie.  The supporting cast all do a good job in a movie that is all Daniel Craig.  This is not your father's Bond...this is better.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Amazing piece of work. I think George and Giles pushed the envelope as far as they dared while still maintaining the integrity of the tunes.  Great mix, tight sound, very worthwhile project.  Set aside 78 minutes and listen to it from beginning to end.  A magical history tour.       cup of tea anyone??
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I was a HUGE No Doubt fan from the first cd until the last. I loved that band! <br /> <br />I gave L.A.M.B. a chance and thought is was meager at best. There was no direction WHATSOEVER. It sounded exactly like what it was - Gwen working with multiple producers.  <br /> <br />The Sweet Escape is downright awful! I listened to this cd on AOL and was mortified at how generic this is. 'Wind It Up' sounds almost exactly like 'Hollaback Girl', while 'Orange County Girl' could not sound anymore bland. The only song I remotely liked was 'Early Winter'...although it does sound eerily familiar to a particular '80's song - I'll let you figure out which ;) <br /> <br />On another note, what is up with her wig and the bling. Talk about sellout! <br /> <br />Again, I USED to be a fan. No longer. End of story.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Gwen Stefani has lost her mind.  Wind it up is the most onboxious song I have ever had the misfortune to hear.  Her first solo album was hit and miss with me.  This one is all miss.  I'm devastated.  When we lost No Doubt, I thought we would be getting something better.  I was wrong.
B000000W5H|5.0|This is a very underrated album. I just want to say that Through the lonely nights (a b-side) should've been on here instead of If you really want be my friend. But since thay can both fit on one disc, I say Through should've been added to the remaster. It's now available on the Rarities disc.I find it works best between Dance and Friend. If you are new to the Stones start with Bleed, Beggars, Exile, Some Girls, tattoo You, and Fingers. Then, get this.
B000B7BRMM|1.0|It doesn't seem like her voice is warm in the recording.<br /><br />The songs are a bit boring as far as jazz themed music goes.<br /><br />She seems like she's sleepy while singing it or doing her impression of a soulful lounge singer.<br /><br />When I look at the cover I ask why is she trying to use sex to sell it with that frizzy ball of hair hanging and her dress hiked up her thighs? It's a sad attempt and you people who purchase it and Amazon who keeps putting her CDs on my front page perpetrate the idea that there's actual music in the CD.<br /><br />This is not very good in my opinion. It's cardboard and boring.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Kurosawa was a genius. This is the kind of film that I can watch several times over and look forward to seeing it being played at revival theaters.

B00003CXCD|5.0|Many many years ago, all the way back to 1953, the Lovely Audrey Hepburn at an age of 24 made her acting debute in this romantic dramacomedy called Roman Holiday. Starring with the charming Gregory Peck she knew how to give a performance that would capture peoples hearts and brought her an Academy Award for best actress that year. <br /> <br />This black and white film is one of the most succesful and memorable films of the 1950's. Like I said in the first part of my review, Audrey Hepburn acts beautifully and gives a stunning debute. She is both funny as lovely, but also knows how to give a fantastic dramatic performance.  <br />Gregory Peck is the charming man next to Hepburn in this romantic adventure. He gives a nice performance that fits well next to Hepburn's performance. He is charming, funny and was the right choice for this role.  <br /> <br />The film was shot entirely in Rome, Italy which gives stunning cinematography. The film may be shot in black and white, the spirit and the atmosphere of the lifely Rome of the fifties has been well captured on camera. The director, William Wyler, has succeded in making this film look absolutely beautiful. He gave the film comedy, drama and romance. Elements that are well brought by the actors and the story.  <br /> <br />The story in short: Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is on her visit in the Italian capital Rome for business. She may look happy when being seen by the people, but behind that beautiful smile she is as unhappy as it can be. She wants to live and get out of the routines she has to follow everyday. One night she escapes from the palace and meets a News reporter played by Gregory Peck who can't wait to get a story. He acts like he doesn't know who she is and takes her into Rome, where they explore the Life she has never had, but only dreamed of having.  <br /> <br />2 hours of pure movie magic. Take a look at this masterpiece if you love Romantic comedies, classic films or a good drama film. Roman Holidayhas all those elements and brings you fantastic entertainment.  <br />It is a film that has captured the hearts of many people all over the globe since it's release 53 years ago. Well, I can proudly say that I am now one of those people.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|This entire album was a giant risk for Mrs. Rossdale. By some parts of this cd can easily be compared to Rock Steady, the parts that are the most challenging end up being the most satisfying. The first single on first listen is definetely offputting but after repeated listens it becomes a great first single. Yummy is amazing with The Neptunes production shining throughout. The most amazing thing about this album is how much Tony Kanal has grown since L.A.M.B. and it will be extremely interesting to see how this effects No Doubt when the inevitable reunion occurs. (2007-08, please?) For every four songs that she takes a risk and triumphs on there is one that doesn't succeed, that's what makes a true artist and I'm glad Gwen decided to shine for us once more.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|<br />Wind it up- Didn't like it as much as I do now that I listen to it more and with the other songs. <br />Sweet Escape-Very good, very fun- perfect for a day at the beach. <br />Orange County Girl- Awesome vibe- I love the \\"poor rich girl\\" sound of gwens voice on the this track and it's catchy as hell.  <br />Early Winter- My least favorite. Not bad but I probably wont listen to it alot. <br />Now that you got it- Probably the most fun song on the album. Very upbeat. <br />4 in the morning- Gwens love song. My 2nd least favorite. It's pretty but the chorus sounds kind of corny. I like the beat though. <br />Yummy- This song is definitely yummy and fun to sing along to. Pharell sounds wicked sexy! <br />Fluorescent- At first I didn't like this one, it sounded too cheesy 80's for me, but it Definitely grew on me! Put this on in the morning when you're getting ready for work- it'll make you happy.  <br />Breakin Up- Another one that grew on me. You just have to embrace the extreme ghettoness of this song. It actually is an awesome anthem.  <br />Dont get it twisted- Definitely my favorite and definitely a club song. The circus beat also elevates this song to excellence. It actually sounds like vintage No Doubt in some parts.  <br />U started it- Right after putting on fluorescent to cheer u up in the morning, put this track on- it is very sugary sweet and outkast like.  <br />Wonderful Life- Sounds like a dramatic 80's soundtrack. It's great if you're in the mood for it.  <br /> <br />All in all, I personally think this album has a better collection of songs than L.A.M.B. I loved L.A.M.B but there are more songs on it that I <br />don't really care for than there are on the sweet escape. Don't judge this album by one song either, there are many different sounds here.
B000J10ERO|4.0|This movie was awesome! Superman has truly returned, after too long a wait for a new movie to be released.

Can Superman stop Lex this time? Let me just remind you not to think, \\"Superman is the good guy. Of course he beats Lex.\\" Lex Luthor has an immense amount of Kryptonite, which is a radioactive substace from Krypton that will hurt Superman. It could even kill him. Will it?

1932907009|5.0|In three words, Blake is great.  He's refined all the gabble-babble theories of storytelling into a format that is as entertaining and \\"instructive\\" as a good movie.     Blake Snyder's \\"method\\" helps me re-see the structure of my stories in a way I would not have imagined on my own.  And the learning process is fun as well.  I feel like a kid again, fooling around with a favorite hobby.
B00003CXCD|4.0|\\"Roman holiday\\" (1953) is a charming movie that you are likely to love, specially if you are fond of romantic comedies that have an excellent director (William Wyler) and great actors (Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck).<br /><br />Do you want to have at least an idea of what this film is about? Well, the main character is Ann (Audrey Hepburn), a beautiful princess that is visiting Rome for official reasons, but that wants to break free of her obligations, at least for one day. This movie tells us what happens when Ann gets to do what she wants, that is a day of almost perfect freedom in Rome. Of course, Ann is not alone: she accidentally meets an American journalist, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a handsome rogue that becomes a possible love interest. But does Joe know who Ann really is? And what does he want from her?<br /><br />All in all, I can say that I enjoyed watching the story of Princess Ann, a young woman that could be compared to a bird trying to spread her wings for the very first time. You will laugh, and maybe cry a little, but I think that \\"Roman holiday\\" is a film that you will not regret watching.<br /><br />Belen Alcat
0793927501|4.0|Anthony Hopkins, & Alec Baldwin, star in \\"The Edge\\" I can't beleive that they really used Bart thr bear for a real live Kodiak bear!!

And they have to survive by hiding from the bear and find food and make warm close. You should watch this movie
006085880X|5.0|First, I would like to say that although this book was written sometime  ago, I don't think the topic gets as much attention as it really should.  Just this year - prior to knowing that this book even existed - I wrote a thesis in my Psychology class on the topic of teenage suicide, depression, and stress.   <br /> <br />This book nailed it.  What I mean by that, is that Jodi Picoult did a fabulous job not only educating the reader on the topic but also by writing a completly compelling novel describing the perspectives of ALL persons involved in a teenage suicide tragedy. <br /> <br />I predict that once this topic is accepted and taken much more seriously, The Pact will become a required reading novel in schools across the nation not only for youth but for parents and adults that interact with youth, as well.  <br /> <br />I would like to add the following for the adults reading this book.  Reading this will make you ponder and sometimes question many aspects of your realtionship with your spouse and children.  It gave me a new appreciation of the love that we share as a family, our ups and downs, and how we deal with and support each other during tragedies that we may encounter in life. <br /> <br />If you think My Sister's Keep is good, you have to read The Pact.  The Pact is deserving of a rating WAY BEYOND 5 stars.
0808514202|5.0|I found that I had this book because it was required for an English class.  I remember I could not find it when it was time to turn it in and my parents had to pay the school for the lost book!  Then it turned up years later and I decided to re-read and I am so glad I did.  I think I lacked the maturity in high school to appreciate the story but as an adult I can really appreciate it.  The character development in the first part of the book is kind of long, but so worth it.  You begin to love the Joad family as you do your own and you feel so slighted for them as they move from one work camp to another and are exploited over and over again by greedy landowners and employers.  You feel their hunger and their pain of loss many times.  I'm pretty sure this book is fiction, but the story is very real and is true for many families that tried to survive during the great depression.  This is one of the best books I have ever read and I'm sure I would like to read more John Steinbeck
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Continuing her \\"solo project\\" as she claims, Gwen's second record is a mixture of success and failure.  The first single `wind it up' is just awful it has a decent/so so beat but her whiny vocals and lyrics that continue the infatuation she has with her own clothing line get played out real quick. Moving on, the record does produce some catchy and genuinely enjoyable tracks; `the sweet escape' is one and `early winter' another.  The latter with its strong chorus line and great music backing it up help the listener forget the previous track `orange county girl' which is really hard to hear all the way through (mind you the song is only three minutes and some seconds). I hate to say this but a white pop singer should not be rapping about growing up in orange county. All the songs produced by the neptunes (a.k.a. pharrell)  are stupid, awkward and generic with the exception of `u started it' a very refreshing tune(pharrell's music production ability is over rated anyway). Please Gwen, stop trying to be ghetto fabulous and please please stop rapping/ yelling/ speaking fast etc. I suppose because `hollaback girl' was such a success she decided to evoke that theme more on this record but it does not work. Tracks like `breaking up' and `yummy' just skip right past them because you will be disappointed as they do not capture a positive side of Gwen (too fake even for her). On the contrary Gwen shines when she sings more 80's Madonna influential stuff and sticks to the new wave genre; tracks such as `florescent', `wonderful life'(which is a really good song reminding me of  depeche mode), and `don't get it twisted' show a much more charismatic and genuine Gwen.  Ironically the two or three songs produced by her band mate T. Kanal show case Gwen's vocal talent and remind fans why they even bothered to purchase (or even download) the record.
0684874350|5.0|This is a beautifully written and humbling story.  Sometimes we all need a little humbling to make us grateful for what we have.  I'm sure that this story is typical of the poverty and neglect that others have faced, not just Irish immigrants, and partly what makes it so fascinating is that it is true. But it is beautifully told as other reviewers have said.  The movie is worth seeing too and always brings tears to my eyes.  I think this is one of those stories that helps you build your own character just a little bit more.
B000FGG60W|5.0|One of the most re-watchable Sci-Fi movies ever made. I can watch this move anytime, anyplace and get just as much enjoyment as the first time I saw it. Very cool and clever special effects that make the planet feel very \\"other-worldly.\\" Awesomely done CGI creatures which we see more of little by little throughout the movie. Absolutely great scenes such as the creatures pulling Fry down the hole, Paris shooting fire with his liquor in the dark night and glimpsing the creatures hovering around him, what Riddick \\"sees\\" with his eyes, Riddick gutting one of the creatures after holding it's arms, Riddick staying in one of the creatures blind spots, and the overall cinematography and pace of the film and way the scenes cut from one to the next. The story is simple--survival--yet highly effective and entertaining with all the characters' pasts and secrets and the choices they have to make throughout the film mixed in with a unique environment and threat. If you like any type of Sci-Fi, you should enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />Best Riddick Lines: <br />\\"Did not know who he was *&#$ing with.\\" <br />\\"I absolutely believe in God. And I hate the #$%^er.\\"
B00009V7T2|1.0|i read all the reviews for this album and then decided to buy. i regret that decision now. this is not pschedelic. it is mini-truck metal. buyer beware.
B000002H2H|3.0|While not my favorite Metallica album, this album still packs a pretty hearty punch. Fans of later metallica might not dig this album as much, because they were still a blistering \\"no-life till leather\\" metal band and didn't quite have the technicality to them as in later releases like Puppets or Justice. However for those fans of Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, etc...you will LOVE this album if you haven't discovered it already.<br /><br />It has a few great tunes. However I don't think it shines a light next to Master of Puppets or AJFA. Still, classic Metallica.
B000002UB3|5.0|For me the greatest album ever. While Sgt. Pepper's tops most people's list, I feel Abbey Road has always been underrated. I rank this album, together with the White Album and Revolver, as better than Pepper's. <br />It was very wise of the Fab 4 to give it another go after the debacle of the Get Back sessions. You can't think of a better ending to a glorious career. <br />Except for \\"Oh Darling\\", there are no weak songs on this album. John and Paul were at their best, and George was laying the groundwork for his epic \\"All Things  Must Pass\\". <br />Side 2 is arguably the best 20 minutes of music you'll ever hear, especially the medley (Sun King, Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, She Came In Through the Bathroom Window). <br />And the 3-pronged guitar solos (Paul, then George, then John)  of \\"The End\\" is a fitting ending. <br /> <br />And to the guy who gave this album 1 star and called the other reviewers \\"moronic\\", the Beatles didn't \\"make\\" the album \\"Hey Jude\\", it was a compilation of non-album singles released by Capitol records. <br /> <br />You obviously know your music because you gave Abbey Road a 1 star rating while you rated the \\"Greatest Hits of Foreigner\\" 5 stars. Stick to reviewing Bon Jovi Cd's.
055358202X|2.0|Yikes.    I've enjoyed this series, honestly I have, but the latest entry--A Feast for Crows--has forced me to seriously reconsider whether it has been worth it.    In the first place, frankly, this is no longer the series I'd signed on for. The first novel introduced a group of characters, the Starks, and led us to believe that they would be central to the narrative. Now with most of them dead or scattered, they're almost incidental to it. Since this volume only deals with half of the current \\"main cast,\\" some of my personal favorites completely disappear (like Tyrion and Daenerys). In short, when I decided to continue on after A Game of Thrones, I didn't know I'd be reading 1000 pages of Brienne and the Iron Born.     Aside from this literary 'bait and switch,' there's also the fact that... well... nothing really happens in this book. Okay, maybe \\"nothing\\" is harsh, but it certainly feels like it. *Lots of things* should happen in a 1000 page book, but Martin strives to put all of the relevant happenings at the very end. Before that, characters spend an endless amount of time wandering from place to place. We readers get to meet all sorts of new and extraneous characters, instead of spending time with the countless we've met before. (Though in fairness, given the time between publishings, it's unlikely we'd remember all of those older characters. I can't keep straight who's died anymore... I forget, is Theon dead?) Incredibly, most of the exciting action (battles and the like) take place between chapters, and we only learn about it through conversation after the fact.    Many of the new characters introduced here get their own POV chapter, sometimes one to a character. The series is becoming increasingly disjointed, and there's certainly no kind of resolution for anything in sight. The one real thru-line is Cersei's story. She probably gets the most chapters, and something like an actual plot. Of course, I can sum up all of those chapters to you here with: Cerseihates and is suspicious of/jealous of everyone and everything. Cersei sits around and snapes at everything, over and over again, and lord but it doesn't get much more exciting than that until page 900.    The series is, at least, consistent in that the worst things always happen to the best characters and things can always be counted on to go wrong (unless you're a villain). While it was once possible to say that Martin was being \\"realistic\\" in showing that, sometimes, bad things happen to the heroes... well, it's almost ridiculous now, in how nothing good ever seems to happen to anyone who could be described as \\"virtuous.\\" Though, of course, very few of the remaining characters could so be described. Most have been decapitated well before this novel. There is a line between \\"realism\\" and \\"sadism,\\" and it isn't all that \\"fine.\\" Martin has crossed it some time ago.    Man, I was looking forward to this book. But really what I was looking forward to was a sequel to the novels that had come before it. Instead, this book (and, increasingly, the series) abandons the characters who have come before and, rather than offer any resolution, creates new conflicts spiraling off into the aether. It doesn't deal with any of those conflicts, either. Instead, it contents itself with having all of its main characters walk from locale to locale, talking, thinking and dreaming but never doing.     George R.R. Martin has taken up close to 4000 pages now, more than three times what Tolkien used in The Lord of the Rings and more than twice War and Peace. He has accomplished very little for all that, and given us little hope that there's any relief in sight. His preferred method of resolving conflicts seems to be having his characters abruptly die, and so that's how I figure he'll tie the loose ends here. It's all rather depressing, if like me you feel you have to finish what you start. Martin is capable of good, snappy storytelling--his graphic novel which takes place in the same world,The Hedge Knight, was really quite good. But it has one large advantage over A Song of Ice and Fire in that it has a beginning, middle and end. A Song of Ice and Fire, on the other hand, seems to be nothing but an endless middle. (The fact that it's a series doesn't mean it can't have both rising and falling action and resolutions to conflicts sprinkled along the way. Examine almost any other series, ever, for examples.)    Not all of these flaws are new to the series--in fact, they've been there since almost the start--but over time they're becoming more and more inescapable and damaging to the overall experience. Two stars for this novel. If things don't rapidly improve, and there's no reason to expect them to, we'll quickly find ourselves at a solitary star. A shame.
0345438205|2.0|I have read this book several times now and still feel like I have missed something.  I really do think Mr Clarke was fighting a deadline to get this one out.  It has so much potential to draw you in but never quite gets you going like the other three... 2001, 2010 and 2061 (mind you even 2061 was showing signs of sagging towards the end).  The four Rama books were brilliant from the very first word to the very last as are many of his other sci-fi stories and the Rama series truly is a classic.  The 2001 saga should be up there with the classics but I don't think it ever can be with the results of 3001.  This is disappointing because it all starts out so well and 3001 isn't a bad read as far as books go but it certainly is not worthy as the final word in this much vaunted series.
0060594888|5.0|Make sure to pick up this book because it can and WILL change your life, but only if you practice what it teaches you and put your insights, talents, abilities, dreams, everything in your head and your heart into ACTION. Everyone has the potential to success, but only a minority of people do success. What seperate the successful from the unsuccessful is ACTION. Dream BIG and start from small, step by step and never give up...This is a book you need not only to READ but to STUDY, highlight, read again and again, reflect, USE the methods it teaches you, and be AWARE of what you are doing and thinking at THIS MOMENT, and always ask yourself whether you are on the RIGHT track to something you want out of life?
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Incubus are a very eclectic band, as evidenced from their varied albums. Their latest effort has many great songs, and Brandon Boyd and his boys are back some great riffs and rhythms. On some tracks, their sounds are remarkably similar to those from other albums (Radiohead's OK Computer comes to mind). Upon first listening to this album, I was confused and unsure what to make of it. Upon closer listening, however, one certainly begins to appreciate the construction of the work. Brandon Boyd is great on vocals, adequetely supported by Ben Kenney. Mike Einzinger is great on the guitarwork, and shows tremendous diversity and skill. Pasillias and Kilmore fill their roles really well. When they are good, Incubus are really good. Tracks like Dig, Anna Molly, Paper Shoes, and Rogues are standouts. The major issue with this album is its structure. One cannot fault Incubus for delving into new territory, but on this album, I feel that their experimentation never coalesces into a fully realized product. That Incubus are willing to explore new creative avenues is fine, but many times this album relishes in experimentation for experimentation's sake. The introduction, Quicksand, is a great song on its own. But does it introduce us to the new Incubus album? Not really. Why split Earth to Bella into two parts? What is the point? These are all curious moves, and while their desire to experiment is fine, it is their inability to structure their new sound consistently that is frustrating. This is why the album deserves a second hearing. Its only when you dissect individual songs that you can begin to appreciate their effort. The band has come a long way since their inception, and their career draws many parallels to that of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Even though their output is not always consistent, it is admirable that they strive to produce diverse output at a time when many bands are content being status quo.
0679731377|4.0|I enjoyed this book greatly.  One of the stories was a bore (I won't say which one), but overall each was unique & contributed to the underlying theme, which other reviewers have already remarked upon quite well.  There are poignant themes which a truly thoughtful person will recognize.<br /><br />Those who are willing to stretch beyond a 'good read' will find it worthwhile.  It is not, however, a heartwarming book, and those looking for something that touches the heart may want to look elsewhere.
0743289412|4.0|Lisey's Story is definitely not the best book I've ever read, but it definitely isn't the worst.<br /><br />This book will likely be a disappointment for King fans who celebrate the more macabre aspect of most of his works, but for those who relish stories that are driven less by plot and more by character, Lisey's Story will satisfy.<br /><br />I think King did a wonderful job portraying the emotions and the grief of a woman who at times hated her husband as much as she loved him and by far my favorite scenes were those that took place in Lisey's memory.<br /><br />At times my heart broke for Scott Landon, a boy with a tortured past and a man fighting against the bad-gunky inside him and escaping to the beautiful and terrible boo'ya moon.<br /><br />It is as much a love story as anything else and if you can keep yourself from starting it with the idea of what a Stephen King book should be, then I think you'll enjoy it.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I will freely admit to being a sucker for British films, but this really was a fun movie.  The performances were all very solid and well done.  There were enough special features to make me happy, though honestly, as far as I'm concerned there can't be too many special features, unless they're just photo galleries.  If you're looking for something a bit different, but will still make you laugh, check out this film.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|This mishmash should have been titled \\"Mucking Around With Some Beatles Songs.\\"  The basic music is some of the excellent music of the Beatles, which has been with us now for a very long time.  It appeared to be a good idea to someone to sample pieces of a lot of songs and then mix them in and out of each other to make something.  Unfortunately, it comes out as cobbled and patched, with unsatisfying abbreviations of many songs, and jumps between songs which are mostly jarring.  The songs themselves each had beauty, integrity and even dignity.  This collection sounds like a bad motel lounge singer's routine.  I can discern no sense or purpose in this album, except the continuing need for money from which the Beatles empire suffers.  This is a \\"must-not-have\\" for Beatles fans, and if anyone out there doesn't have the original recordings, I'd save my money and buy them instead.
0740748475|5.0|I would give this a billion stars, if I could.  But I can't, so I will settle for a 5 out of 5.  Brilliant and subtle Humor, Wisdom, Childhood; Watterson is a genius, and a master of his craft.
B000ENWKN8|2.0|I don't know what happened with this effort.  I have yet to stop listening to Hellbilly Deluxe and Sinister Urge.  However,I have listened to Educated Horses (through) once, maybe twice. I just cannot make myself listen to it.  And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everybody should see this movie!  Everybody, no matter what their political background, or country of residence.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This movie was horrible.  Roth just needs to quit trying to make horror movies with gore as the only horror element.  Not to mention, the story sucked.  Thats not to say things like this don't happen, the world is a crazy place.  The acting was sub-par, there was no suspense, and the extreme gore that everyone probably watched the movie for, wasn't anything new or scary.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|Opening with an assassination of Romulans at the Romulan Senate shows this to be more exciting than its predecessor \\"Insurrection\\". Nemesis is an underrated film that only recently has gained the respect it deserved all along. I always felt that this film had a good sense of balance between humor (Data singing \\"Blue Skies\\" and Worf objecting to being nude at the Betazed wedding), action (the dune buggy scene and the Enterprise ramming into the Scimitar for example), and drama (the tragic end of the film).<br /><br />The story of Nemesis has always interested me, in a way, both Data and Picard have met there twins, one being good, one being evil. The villain Shinzon is very interesting and worthy opponent for Picard see he is he. No one can beat you at your own game better than yourself. B4 had a child quality that I had sympathy for. Never understanding what was going on, only doing what he was told, not intentionally bad. So I feel for his character. Both Shinzon and B4 force us to ask the question of what our lives would have been like if things had been different.<br /><br />Two parts of the film really stick out in my mind that make this film excellent, mainly dealing with the ramming of the Enterprise into the great Scimitar ship, a very dramatic scene that was pulled off perfectly. The Reman ship the Scimitar is quite impressive and proves most formidable to the Enterprise. Another scene that caught my attention was when Troi probed into the Viceroy's mind to discover the location of the Scimitar, well done! Of course, seeing Admiral Janeway was a thrill for me since I loved the TV series Voyager. It is nice to see her character at such a great position.<br /><br />Nemesis had some of the best acting I have seen out of the TNG crew, and I love TNG. When Riker is fighting the Viceroy in the last battle between the two, you can literally see the fear in Riker's at not knowing where the enemy was hiding. The chemistry between Picard and Shinzon was electric; you can feel the hostility just by watching the two peer into each others eyes.<br /><br />And yes, this is the tragic film in which this is the death of Data, a very quite moment with the only words spoken being \\"Good Bye\\". This is indeed a sad scene, not so much of his death, but his memorial service when they are discussing Data even now brings tears to my eyes. But there is comfort that B4 at least has some of Data left in him.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film which is finally getting praise by fans for being so. Only the future will tell if this becomes even more popular than it is, and I believe it will. As I watched Picard leave his office and stride down the hall for what could be the last time we see, I realized something, if this is indeed the last TNG movie, it was definitely a good high class film to go out on.ic; you can feel the hostility just by watching the two peer into each others eyes.  <br /> <br /> <br />And yes, this is the tragic film in which this is the death of Data, a very quite moment with the only words spoken being \\"Good Bye\\".

0800177177|5.0|This is a very well made faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel. It was terrifying, sexy, adventitious, and bold.<br /><br />This film presented Dracula the way he was written by Stoker in ways that films of the past such as those staring Max Shrek, Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, and Frank Langella did not have the budget or technology to do, despite all of them being great films.<br /><br />The creature designs, sets, costumes, acting, and over all story telling was great! This makes a very well made horror film.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Despite the popular opinion, I really do enjoy this film. It has some moments that are really interesting, such as the look into both Spock and McCoy's life before Starfleet. That's what is great about the movie; it has many scenes that are classic Kirk, Spock and McCoy moments. Perhaps, the most interesting thing about this movie is that there is a Vulcan, who I won't say who it is so I won't spoil it, that has emotions. This was later used again in the TV series Enterprise. Not to mention, Gene Roddenberry wanted to do a movie about discovering God on Star Trek years before this film was made. So this movie is somewhat an idea that Gene himself tossed around for a long time.<br /><br />It is true that the movie suffers from lack of funds since the studios and people behind this movie were too occupied with other movies of the time to focus more on this movie. It is a shame, with the right amount of money, this movie could have been more than it became. With that negative thought of reality when it comes to lack of budget, I still say that this movie isn't half bad, but actually quite good.
B000J103PC|2.0|Ok way to spend a couple of hours, but hey, didn't I see something oh so similar called \\"Working Girl\\" starring Melanie Griffith, Sigorney Weaver, and Harrison Ford ? That one was I think a more memorable 'edition'. A few differences, but similar new girl-underdog-to slave driver boss senario.
B000I5X81K|3.0|Josh has been a favorite of mine for some time now. I have been anxiously waiting for a new CD to be released. His album CLOSER,is by far his best. AWAKE lacks vibrance and enthusiasm. I believe it is due to the song choices. I wish he would have just put out a Christmas album. I am sad.
B00004WG2F|5.0|As much As I would love to give Brad Pitt all the credit for his outstanding performance in this movie, I just can't. He was Perfect, He can almost make a horrible storyline seem interesting with his skill. But you see this story.... This Story + Brad Pitt made one incredible movie. Well done....... Good enough to make a grown man cry. It needs to be watched.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. However, I am unhappy with the director's cut Unrated version. I found the theatrical version to be a tighter knit storyline. Its flow was much better and it gave a better presentation overall.    The biggest change the viewer will notice is the beginning. I love how the theatrical version just starts without any credits, like Collateral did. The unrated version has a different beginning that has credits. In the Theatrical version the viewer is dropped into a scene and doesn't know what's going on, but we piece it together. The new beginning raises the viewer into a boat race which just doesn't deliver the same drama and excitement as the thumping club does. In addition, the boat scene only extends the period of time where the viewer doesn't know what's going on; the only thing the scene does is add some beautiful cinematic skyline shots of Miami.    The handful of other \\"new\\" scenes are not needed and hurt the overall experience of this movie. Like a brief scene that shows the Nicholas character on the phone with Yero. Tubbs and Crocket are sitting beside him while he talks. This scene was pointless. We know Yero is located in the South American city; we know Nicholas will make contact and set the meet up (or at least attempt to). And realistically Nicholas will do these calls by himself without any \\"supervision.\\" Seeing a scene of Nicholas on the phone for a few seconds with Tubbs and Crocket sitting there looking bored does nothing and was smartly left out of the original version.    Another scene shows Tubbs making a call to Trudy and Trudy having received flowers, then a diner meet. This scene I liked because of how it illuminated the investigative and intelligence gathering skills of Yero. Also, how Trudy told Tubbs to worry about himself cause he's in the thick of it, not her. But despite this, the viewer knows before seeing this that Yero has sophisticated intelligence gathering capabilities (he breached an FBI undercover team). And we know that the fabricated identities will be tested, layers will be breached. That is why Trudy set up a 3 and 4 level deep cover for them and they are living in a safe house. The subtle hint of saying Give my best to your families, and concern on Tubbs' part that is never explicitly expressed on screen by its own scene has its allure too (and this is what the viewer gets with the theatrical version). But more so I like how the Theatrical version leads the viewer into the next phase of the movie directly after Isabella and Sonny have that prolonged gaze exchange after the meet with Montoya. It leaves the viewer entranced with that exchange. Breaking away to Trudy and Tubbs destroys the mystery of that moment.    Another scene is added after the Crocket/Isabella love scene. When I saw this picture in the theater I remember thinking how much I liked how the music during the love scene transitioned us directly to the couple in public having breakfast. It struck me as authentic; real. The added scene destroyed this flow that I liked so much.    Another new scene shows Isabella getting flex cuffed by Crocket after Crocket removes her from the final shootout area. Although this scene explains why she is handcuffed later on, it severely derails the dramatic flow of music that leads us into their separation. I also felt that Isabella slapping at Crocket while he drives her away was out of character. She may feel like hitting because she's devastated about her feelings for Crocket but she prides herself on being a \\"business woman.\\" Regardless, I felt the original version does a better job of highlighting the emotion, confusion, and conflict she's feeling through her inaction (as opposed to a slapping fit).    Another change is how the In The Air song is played not at the end of the movie (like in the Theatrical release) but during the build-up to the final shootout. Although I do like this placement of the song (the editors synced it well to enhance theexcitement and drama), there is something to be said for the use of the score during this part. The In The Air song energizes the buildup. But the score tends to let the images do the talking, adding realism in my opinion. When Crocket and Tubbs touch fists before driving off to the meet, the score leaves the viewer with a forlorn sense of their hesitation to go but for their obligation to each other. The In The Air placement looses this sense, but adds a more emotional jacked up experience. The scene where Switek walks into the Aryan group to see the money gives a foreboding glimpse into where he's headed. The absence of music allows this moment's magnitude to become apparent. Playing In The Air here again ratchets up the emotion but forsakes some of the innate drama inherent within the scene itself by over-dramatizing it. Each edit gives the viewer a different experience. I prefer the score though to avoid the melodrama.     The original version has some bits and pieces including whole scenes that are absent from the Unrated version. For example, I distinctly remember Crocket talking about \\"Skill Sets\\" on the roof meeting with the FBI ASAC. This dialogue does not appear in the unrated version, however. I felt this line was important because it communicated that not just anyone can step in and perform this service. Another deletion is a scene that takes place right before the meeting with Montoya in the original version where Crocket and Tubbs wait at a meet and no one shows. But this scene did nothing for the picture and Mann smartly cuts it from the Unrated version, resulting in a nice segue into the Montoya meet scene.    Overall however, I believe Michael Mann's original cut is superior. The deletion of the scene prior to the Montoya meet is the only strength of the Unrated version. All the other changes are weaknesses.    At least Michael Mann made the original version available on DVD. It'd be nice if he put a commentary to that version though.
0743289412|1.0|It was extremely boring - didn't like the style of writing - refuse <br />to waste my time beyond about 50 pages.   <br /> <br />I really dont think he wrote it.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. However, I am unhappy with the director's cut Unrated version. I found the theatrical version to be a tighter knit storyline. Its flow was much better and it gave a better presentation overall.  <br />  <br />The biggest change the viewer will notice is the beginning. I love how the theatrical version just starts without any credits, like Collateral did. The unrated version has a different beginning that has credits. In the Theatrical version the viewer is dropped into a scene and doesn't know what's going on, but we piece it together. The new beginning raises the viewer into a boat race which just doesn't deliver the same drama and excitement as the thumping club does. In addition, the boat scene only extends the period of time where the viewer doesn't know what's going on; the only thing the scene does is add some beautiful cinematic skyline shots of Miami.  <br />  <br />The handful of other \\"new\\" scenes are not needed and hurt the overall experience of this movie. Like a brief scene that shows the Nicholas character on the phone with Yero. Tubbs and Crocket are sitting beside him while he talks. This scene was pointless. We know Yero is located in the South American city; we know Nicholas will make contact and set the meet up (or at least attempt to). And realistically Nicholas will do these calls by himself without any \\"supervision.\\" Seeing a scene of Nicholas on the phone for a few seconds with Tubbs and Crocket sitting there looking bored does nothing and was smartly left out of the original version.  <br />  <br />Another scene shows Tubbs making a call to Trudy and Trudy having received flowers, then a diner meet. This scene I liked because of how it illuminated the investigative and intelligence gathering skills of Yero. Also, how Trudy told Tubbs to worry about himself cause he's in the thick of it, not her. But despite this, the viewer knows before seeing this that Yero has sophisticated intelligence gatheringcapabilities (he breached an FBI undercover team). And we know that the fabricated identities will be tested, layers will be breached. That is why Trudy set up a 3 and 4 level deep cover for them and they are living in a safe house. The subtle hint of saying Give My Best To Your Families, and concern on Tubbs' part that is never explicitly expressed on screen by its own scene has its allure too (and this is what the viewer gets with the theatrical version). But more so I like how the Theatrical version leads the viewer into the next phase of the movie directly after Isabella and Sonny have that prolonged gaze exchange after the meet with Montoya. It leaves the viewer entranced with that exchange. Breaking away to Trudy and Tubbs destroys the mystery of that moment.  <br />  <br />Another scene is added after the Crocket/Isabella love scene. When I saw this picture in the theater I remember thinking how much I liked how the music during the love scene transitioned us directly to the couple in public having breakfast. It struck me as authentic; real. The added scene destroyed this flow that I liked so much.  <br />  <br />Another new scene shows Isabella getting flex cuffed by Crocket after Crocket removes her from the final shootout area. Although this scene explains why she is handcuffed later on, it severely derails the dramatic flow of music that leads us into their separation. I also felt that Isabella slapping at Crocket while he drives her away was out of character. She may feel like hitting because she's devastated about her feelings for Crocket but she prides herself on being a \\"business woman.\\" Regardless, I felt the original version does a better job of highlighting the emotion, confusion, and conflict she's feeling through her inaction (as opposed to a slapping fit).  <br />  <br />Another change is how the In The Air song is played not at the end of the movie (like in the Theatrical release) but during the build-up to the final shootout. Although I do like this placement of the song (the editors synced it well to enhance the excitement and drama), there is something to be said for the use of the score during this part.

The deletion of the scene prior to the Montoya meet is the only strength of the Unrated version. Much like Michael Mann's revamped DVD release version of Last of the Mohicans was not as good as the theatrical version, Miami Vice's Unrated version is not as good as the theatrical.  <br />  <br />At least Michael Mann made the original version available on DVD (unlike Last of the Mohicans). It'd be nice if he put a commentary to the theatrical version though.  <br />
B00005JPCA|5.0|I own all 21 Bond films and happen to like Connery the best as James Bond but I believe Daniel Craig was the correct choice to play James Bond in the new Casino Royale. Previous James Bond movies were the suave, distinguished, make no mistakes Bond, Casino Royale was Bond when he first gets his 007 status and still has to become the Bond that is distinguished and makes no mistakes. I loved this film and am excited for the next one that Craig signed on for. This movie works for Bond fans and those that have never seen Bond films. Excellent is all I can say. For the Craig haters just remember that this is the beggining of (just getting 00 stauts)James Bond and Brosnan is to distinguished for this part.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|So you've read the reviews and are still not sure. This is one fun movie. I liked it best on my 3rd viewing. It has a very cool and sortof sexy soundtrack that at first reminded me of the the one from Bladerunner, as it was so full of spaces....very melodic, and repeats itself in different forms thru the movie. The filming is nice if somewhat dark at times, but the Noir staging is Very nice. The plot keeps you guessing and thats all I will say about plot because it is so fun. Buy this movie and enjoy!!
B000FGGE68|3.0|Kind of a eye candy movie, with pretty good action associated<br /><br /> with the main character.  Just like a comic book the fights are<br /><br />pretty unbelievable....but because the camera angles and the direction<br /><br />is pretty good, it gives the movie a boost.<br /><br />In line with Aeron Flux, but better than Bloodrayne ...except for the<br /><br />blood and guts department in which Bloodrayne rules.<br /><br />So yes, definitively is worth a showing or two. Get it second hand.
B000CFLFX4|1.0|this is the worst sweeper I have ever wasted my money on.The customer service <br />lied when I ordered I was told I would get a second battery, When it arrived <br />without I called and was told that I was wrong that No one told me that and I got the Deluxe model and that was an up grade and I if I didn't like it <br />tuff Just send it back. Now I wish I had it is just JUNK!! <br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
B00006V9A0|1.0|Nirvana sucks, and are officially the most overrated band of all time.
B000EGDC14|5.0|This group is a duo that is worth every penny spent.  I have downloaded mp3's for quite some time, but let me rest assure that Goldfrapp is a part of my CD collection, and always will be.  Felt Mountain was different, intriguing, dark, soothing, synthetic and modern rivalry to any electronic band and/or group.  Black Cherry was a changing point in Goldfrapp's history of music artinerary (or however you spell that word), but the change was upbeat, glamorous, and once again, very clear with excellent quality and definition.   <br /> <br />Their latest - Supernature - is still a lovely disco-electronic and a deeply synthetic CD to own in any collection.  This CD proves that change doesn't ruin a group, it can enhance any audience or fan to even love the music and lyrics more as time flies, as we know it.   <br /> <br />I definitely without a doubt would recommend any of their three awesomely produced and created albums/cd's.  This type of music, by most of us, will always be remembered and loved truly and deeply without any hesitation.  I almost like that they aren't surfacely recognized in the states, as far as charts and radio play, because we can easily get their music and enjoy it without it being overly commercialized like some modern Hip-Hop-ish groups, or modern Pop acts, etc.   <br /> <br />Goldfrapp - Thank you for changing the world history of our music and creations.   <br />

B000HBKCDC|5.0|Not just another proverbial \\"pop star gone Christmas\\" album! Absolutely beautiful and elegant! Soothing and captures the serenity of the season.

Her ethereal voice does absolute justice to these beautiful holiday classics!
B000J10ERO|4.0|The big question we all had going in to Superman Returns was, could Bryan Singer do for Superman what he did for The X-Men? The answer to that question is yes, I mean no, I guess I mean almost.  My initial reaction was that Superman Returns was a wonderful motion picture, long on spectacle and action.  Upon subsequent reflection, however, I noticed some flaws in the film which, while not fatal, did detract from my overall enjoyment.<br /><br />The film is well paced; although some have said it is slow in the beginning, some exposition was clearly needed to get us all back in the groove, if only to establish what has been going on for the past five \\"movie years\\".  So, we have several scenes in order to reestablish the characters of Lex Luthor, Lois Lane, and Clark Kent.  The payoff of the leisurely build up is an incredible air disaster sequence, which ends with Big Blue stopping a falling airliner mere inches from impact on the pitcher's mound of a major league baseball stadium.  Superman gets a standing ovation from a crowd shocked but overjoyed to see him again.  Americana simply oozes from the screen: America's number one fictional icon working his magic during an exhibition of America's national pastime, captured on America's favorite obsession, a huge TV screen.<br /><br />The movie moves very quickly from that moment on, as Luthor's plan unfurls.  No need to describe the subsequent action, suffice it to say that the ending feels as if it comes just a little too fast, and that, as Martha Stewart is apt to say, is a good thing.<br /><br />Overall, the film virtually ignores character development, but that is forgivable, as we all already intimately know the players. It also falls a little short in the humor department, which was a key part of the charm of both Superman and Superman II.  (Example: Lois:<br /><br />Any more at home like you? Clark: Uh, not really, no.)<br /><br />Superman Returns is mainly about homage, mostly to the first two Christopher Reeve films: the film utilizes John Williams' original score, and picks up on situations covered by those two films.  Marlon Brando's talking head is back, as are parts of John Williams' music, and Manhattan once again stands in for Metropolis.  Brandon Routh slavishly imitates Christopher Reeves, even going so far as to deliver Reeve's line from the first film about flying being statistically safer than any other form of travel.  Another nod to the first film is the mention of the Kryptonite Meteor from Addis Ababa; yet another is Kevin Spacey paraphrasing Gene Hackman's immortal lines about real estate:<br /><br />Luthor: Miss Teschmacher, when I was six years old my father said to me...<br /><br />Miss Teschmacer: \\"Get out.\\"<br /><br />Luthor: Before that. He said, \\"Son, stocks may rise and fall, utilities and transportation systems may collapse. People are no damn good, but they will always need land and they'll pay through the nose to get it! Remember,\\" my father said...<br /><br />Otis: \\"... land.\\"<br /><br />Luthor: Right.<br /><br />Other nice touches, unrelated to the first two movies:  Noel Neill is in the first shot of the movie, as the victim of Lex's machinations. Jack Larson plays a bartender in a subsequent scene.  Frank Langella as Perry White delivers the line \\"Great Caesar's Ghost!\\"  The machine gun sequence is pure Fleischer (the shot to the eye was a GREAT touch).  Did you catch the news photo which recreated the cover to Superman's first appearance in Action #1?<br /><br />The Messiah theme?  A bit overdone.  Eva Marie Saint as Ma Kent?  Inspired.  The scenes of mayhem in Metropolis? Spectacular.  Visual and verbal references to Prometheus, Atlas and The Pieta?  Cool.  Young Clark running at super speed through an Iowa cornfield? Priceless.<br /><br />Now the gripes.  Kevin Spacey is not Gene Hackman.  The only time I really believed he was Lex Luthor was in the scene where Superman is beaten to a pulp, and Spacey delivers the coup de grace with a Kryptonite knife (\\"Now...fly...\\").  Brandon Routh is not Christopher Reeve--he turns in an acceptable performance, but what he really does is make you appreciate Reeve's charisma in the role.  Finally, Kate Bosworth is not Margot Kidder--her Lois is a cipher, you wonder why Supes finds her attractive.<br /><br />My other gripes are solidly grounded in continuity geekdom:<br /><br />Geek Question #1:  Superman was human during his sexual tryst with Lois, so how could the result of that horizontal mambo exhibit super strength?<br /><br />Geek Question #2: Superman wiped Lois' memory clean at the end of Superman II.  How disconcerting was it for her to discover that she was pregnant?  Did she conclude that she had conceived spontaneously?  Or that she was merely date raped by an alien who was somehow able to repress her memories?  Yuck.<br /><br />Geek Question #3:  Superman is surprised that Lois has a child?  What, she was wearing a lead girdle the day he left earth?<br /><br />Geek Question #4: Superman's son takes a life with his first feat of super strength.  Will he need super counseling to get over that?  How does his Dad react to that--he had powers growing up, and yet has never killed anyone.<br /><br />Of course, some (like my wife), would ask, \\"Why do you even care?\\"  My answer is, I don't know, I guess it doesn't matter much in the scheme of things.  But, in the final analysis, I guess I get frustrated because these and other flaws could have been easily corrected, but weren't (check out the comic book adaptation of the film for proof of this, it's way more continuity oriented than the film that inspired it).  It's bothersome that a good movie could have been transformed into an outstanding one if someone had cared enough.  Oh well, I can always hope that this state of affairs will improve with the sequel.  Singer has been quoted as saying that while Superman Returns allowed him to introduce the cast, the sequel would allow him to 'go Wrath of Khan on it.'  Let's hope he realizes that lofty ambition.h a Kryptonite knife (\\"Now...fly...\\").

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I saw this movie when it was at the theatres.  I must admit that I was a little skeptical as I entered the theatre, I assumed this would be a very depressing movie.  I WAS SO WRONG.  I felt totally empowered after seeing Gore's film.  He makes suggestions that are not difficult to implement, it is so uplifting to know that we CAN make a difference.
B00005JPCA|3.0|Daniel Craig is a good actor, although I'm not sure he'd be my choice for the suave 007.  Pierce Brosnan had that role in his pocket.  Craig's Bond is a lot rougher, more in the American mold of the hero with a bad attitude, than Brosnan's super-competent international guy who never even wrinkled his clothes.  But that's the script, not the actor, and if Craig looks more the tough-guy part, with his flat nose and weathered looks, it's not his acting that is responsible for the character change.  This is a different Bond, from the script.  Give me the old Bond scripts with unbelievable hi-tech gadgetry and the imperturbably cool Brosnan.  Or at least, let me watch Matador.
B000JU7NCE|4.0|First of all, I don't believe that I could give anything the Cure ever released anything lower than 5 stars, but this DVD does have some flaws.  first of all, i will be the first to admit that I am not thrilled about this 4 man lineup.  I love the return of Porl, but a Cure without a keyboardist is like chewing gum without any teeth.....well maybe not that bad, but you get my point.  Don't get me wrong though, they sound wonderful in the songs they play, but something is just lacking. <br />Now to the video quality.  This is like a mix of home video and professional shots.  By no means does this come near Trilogy visually.  This is more of a raw, uncut version and probably more realistic.  I can see why many people would not like watching something like this.  The scenes jump clear to hazy, then back to clear, and could get annoying. <br />Those would be my 2 biggest complaints.  Otherwise, the DVD sound is beautiful, and song list is nice also.  Of course, a lot of my favorite songs would be pretty difficult to play without a keyboard. <br /> <br />Overall: A must have for any Cure fans.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Western artists who dabble in so-called \\"world music\\" (an overused term) often strive to sound so authentic, or faithful to the spirit of the ethnic styles they are appropriating, that they end up sounding bland and stereotypical. This is not the case for Loreena McKennitt, who truly understands the spirit of not just her primary interest, Celtic music, but also the many other styles from around the world that she blends into her luxurious sound. This album's fascinating liner notes tell the story of McKennitt's travels around the world, seeking both historical evidence of mysterious Celtic movements, and the sounds of the lands the Celts may have passed through in ancient times. This has resulted in a musical work of astonishing skill and beauty. Praise also belongs to McKennitt's virtuoso band, especially the violinists and percussionists. The only real problem with this album is that McKennitt's vocal melodies lack true variety - for instance, note the similarities among \\"The English Ladye and the Knight,\\" \\"Penelope's Song,\\" and \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky.\\" Another general concern is that the music is so flawlessly executed that it can be hard to latch onto as it floats by, with \\"Sacred Shabbat\\" and \\"Never-Ending Road\\" being prime examples. But ultimately, McKennitt shows us that quality world music is not borrowed, but is truly created through living it. [~doomsdayer520~]
B000IHY9SE|5.0|All the artist on this cd can rap and did step up their game. If you like good rap & good music, this is the best buy. F..K anybody giving this cd 1 star.
B0007OASII|5.0|Given that I very strongly liked this CD, the first by Kamelot that I've purchased, the fact that it then grew on me further is saying something.  A bit of background here might be in order.  I'm not really a 'Metal Head'.  My experience with Metal before a purchasing binge a couple of weeks ago was limited primarily to Queensryche.  So rather than compare this to other Metal CDs, I'll describe what about it I like: <br /> <br />1. Wonderful vocals by Khan.  He doesn't have the same range as say, Geoff Tate (who hits lows and highs in Queensryche's earlier works with ease) but what he has is an even more melodic voice that stays in the baritone to mid-range regions most of the time.  (The guest vocals are worth noting too.  Shagrath provides growls on a couple of tracks.  While I don't like the 'Black Metal'/'Death Metal' style of vocals as a rule, they provided a strong counterpoint to Khan's much more melodic ones and worked here primarily because they're used sparingly.  Simone Simons from \\"Epica\\" is also used sparingly but to very good effect, particularly in \\"The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)\\" which was a great song up until she 'appears' and then the song elevates to a level which places it in my favorites of any genre). <br /> <br />2. Variety.  While Khan's vocals add a feeling of continuity from song to song, there are reasonably hard 'rockers' with some great guitar riffs, some songs where the keyboards do most of the work, and finally a very mellow, melancholy ballad \\"Abandoned\\". <br /> <br />3. Restraint.  While reading some other reviews I noticed how people kept saying that the instruments are used when needed, but that the band avoids the \\"gratuitous\\" solos that seem pretty common elsewhere.  Now this is probably a matter of opinion, but in 'one shot' songs (ie, songs unconnected to any other song) I don't mind the solos that much from other bands, but if they're especially long or different than the rest of the song it can break the flow a bit.  In concept albums where the songs are part of an overall story, the solos or usage of instruments that overwhelm the song are less desired by me.  And I agree with the other reviewers that in \\"The Black Halo\\", Kamelot shows the right amount of restraint while allowing the band members to shine nevertheless. <br /> <br />4. The 'grow on you' effect.  As I said above, this CD was probably my favorite of a group of about 6 that I purchased recently (all differing kinds of metal, all by different artists).  But the funny thing was, after listening to them all once, I could very easily get songs by the other CDs stuck in my head but I literally couldn't remember one tune from \\"The Black Halo\\".  That made me wonder if my initial impression was wrong.  After another couple of listens, I was able to get \\"The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)\\" stuck in my head.  By far the most 'accessible' song in my opinion, it also has a shot to get your non-metal friends into trying the CD (it immediately got put in my 'The Lighter Side of Metal' playlist, and is the song that convinced me to turn the playlist into a CD that I'll loan out to friends or play on car trips).   <br /> <br />The odd thing still was that I began to view the CD as 'not metal' at all.  I couldn't remember any of the 'riffs' in other songs and just had an impression of Khan's voice.  This I think is mainly because of my #3 point above.  When I listen to the songs, I hear the riffs, but even after multiple playings the CD fades from memory more than any other CD I have.  This is a good thing.. It almost makes it new again each  time I listen.  Slowly, other songs have begun to achieve the 'stick in head' status, but it's a very unique overall feel which I'm spending a lot of time explaining and not sure it's very clear what I mean. :)  Let me just be clear on this, the sensation is a GOOD one. <br /> <br />In any event, even if  you don't currently think you like Metal, you might give this one a shot.  I can't speak for anyof Kamelot's other CDs but Amazon will be getting more of my money for more of their CDs very quickly.
B00005K3OT|1.0|A huge budget film trying to look and feel like and indie... and failing miserably.  Johnny is wooden, Juliette is awkward and the dialog is stilted. <br /> <br />And shame on this film for making a Protestant minister the story's ignorant villain.  Protestants have been massacred, repressed and persecuted in France for centuries.  Protestants account for less than 2% of the French population today.  Villainizing the Huguenot church when this faith has already suffered so much prejudice in France is insensitive and irresponsible.  Will the film's sequel feature an ignorant, villainous rabbi in 20th Century Germany?  Nothing quite like kicking a people and their faith when they've already suffered from near-extinction...
B000K7VHJQ|4.0|Movies do inspire and can bring the most heardened heart to a heart of conversion, miracles, and faith. this movie did exactly that. miracles took place because of this movie in people's lives. watch the miracles of the passion of christ a doccumentary to this film. even though this movie is not biblical, miriyam the mother of the masheeakh seeing the devil, yehudas the siccari (iscariot in latin), being tormented by demons appearing as children, the devil at the garden of gethsemane convincing the messiah there is not way he can bear the sins of others,the film did a great job when it comes to acting,language,cinematography,costuming, music,and directing.  <br /> <br />the crucifixion and flogging of ha masheeakh (the anointed one)is hard to watch and realistic to the core of what he really endured and died from. the ending of the film was fantastic. seeing a great white light coming from the pressence of a great mal'akh (angel) rolling the roman sealed rock away from the tomb with angelic music in the background, and then seeing the resurrection of the masheeakh with his wounds. iam jewish so seeing this film from that perspective is very difficult. the jewish community in america sensed the fear as did i that christian anit-semitism, anti judaism would erupt into perseuction. toda hshem (thank G'd) no persecutions happened except for mel gibson's anti-jewish statment that we jews cause all the wars.  <br /> <br />not many people realize in the other film which is in this two dvd collection, when the crowd says \\"his blood be upon us and our children\\" that prophecy was fulfilled \\"she will give birth to a son and you are to name him yahshua (which means yah saves,)because he will save his people (israel)from their sins. ---matisyahu 21. well he did exactly that and the crowd not knowing said how they were to be saved. by the atoning blood and blood covenant of the masheeakh. great film you want to know the facts read the bible.    <br /> <br /> <br />

Smoke and Mirrors is a very good introduction to this talented writer's imagination.  Be sure and read the foreword, as this is where he has hidden one of the book's best stories.
B00005OAE6|3.0|Some Seger songs really rock, some don't ever seem to get going, and some of both categories get overplayed on the radio.  There are all of the above on this CD.  But Old Time Rock & Roll is an anthem for people like me who are stuck in the 70's with most of our musical tastes.  Most of it is engaging to listen to and the mellow stuff can be skipped easily with the >> button. <br />

However, I've written a separate review about [[ASIN:B000K8LV1O The Secret DVD]] here at Amazon.com If you can't find my review here--it's quite buried--you can also read it at my website in the Reviews--DVDs section. THe direct URL is [...]<br /><br />An attractive book of 198-pages, The Secret is a deft compilation of direct quotes from the movie version, as well as some connecting thoughts provided by Ms. Byrne. The Secret, according to the author, provides the key to eradicating disease, acquiring massive wealth, overcoming obstacles, and achieving what many would regard as impossible. The Secret heralded discovery, advancement and prosperity through millennia, but was largely withheld from the public. Luminaries like Einstein, Jesus, Plato, Newton, Emerson, Lincoln, Ford--they all knew the secret and applied it accordingly.<br /><br />So what's the secret? The law of attraction, which, as you probably know, is not new to anyone familiar with New Age/consciousness ideology. The Secret culls wise, practical insights from noted authors, teachers, and life-coaches that show readers how thoughts create reality. That is, what you think literally becomes your life. Every person, every disease, every relationship, every social situation--all are the result of the law of attraction. You cannot behold or experience *anything* that is not the result of your \\"vibration\\" magnetizing to a corresponding manifestation. Some of the exceptional contributors to The Secret include Michael Beckwith (founder of Agape International Spiritual Center often featured in What Is Enlightenment? Magazine), Jack Canfield (Chicken Soup for the Soul series), Hale Dwoskin (The Sedona Method), John Gray (Mars and Venus), Neale Donald Walsch (Conversations With God), Fred Alan Wolf (Dr. Quantum), and many others.<br /><br />Here are some compelling excerpts from The Secret:<br /><br />\\"This is really fun. It's like having the Universe as your catalogue. You flip through it and say, `I'd like to have this experience and I'd like to have that product and I'd like to have a person like that.' It is You placing your order with the Universe. It's really that easy.\\" - Dr. Joe Vitale<br /><br />\\"When you visualize then you materialize. Here's an interesting thing about the mind: we took Olympic athletes and had them run their event only in their mind, and then hooked them up to sophisticated biofeedback equipment. Incredibly, the same muscles fired in the same sequence when they were running the race in their mind as when they were running it on the track. How could this be? Because the mind can't distinguish whether you're really doing it or whether it's just a practice. If you've been there in the mind, you'll go there in the body.\\" - Dr. Dr. Denis Waitley<br /><br />\\"There is no blackboard in the sky on which God as written your purpose, your mission in life...your purpose is what you say it is. Your mission is the mission you give yourself. Your life will be what you create it as, and no will stand in judgment of it, now or ever.\\" - Neale Donald Walsch<br /><br />Without exception, every contributor to The Secret offers transcendent yet usable wisdom for enhancing well-being. That is, except the author/editor herself. In my opinion, she basically ruined the book for me with two shallow, accusatory contributions that have no place in this incredible book. And, it's these kind of Western superficialities that have ruined law of attraction books for me in the past.<br /><br />After being very \\"high\\" after watching the DVD, I decided to read the book. I was halfway through when I read this about weight loss, and received a deafening record scratch in my head:<br /><br />\\"The most common thought that people hold, and I held it too, is that food was responsible for my weight gain. That is a belief that does not serve you, and in my mind now it is complete balderdash! Food is not responsible for putting on weight. It is your *thought* that food is responsible for putting on weight that actually has food put on weight....IF YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT, DO NOT OBSERVE THEM, BUT IMMEDIATELY SWITCH YOUR MIND TO THE PICTURE OF YOU IN YOUR PERFECT BODY AND FEEL IT\\" (caps mine for emphasis).<br /><br />It is this kind of stupid, shallow, prejudicial comment that turns people off the law of attraction! She didn't need to include this inane section in the book, for the wisdom offered by the OTHER contributors clearly spelled out how to attract what you want, cultivate internal joy, radiate gratitude, and so on. What the author has done is what many New Agers (and religious leaders) have done: try to fault readers/disciples by throwing on some \\"New Age guilt\\" (as Joan Borysenko would say). This is not new. There were infirmed people in Jesus day and the judgmental, cruel religious leaders at the time--the Pharisees--wanted to know \\"Who sinned? The boy or his parents?\\" Jesus replied NEITHER--it was for the glory of God (because the child eventually became healed).<br /><br />**And just in case you don't think this kind of attitude causes guilt and suffering in others, an 18 year old girl happened to write me the day I posted this review, blaming herself for her agoraphobia because of the Law of Attraction**<br /><br />But what is perhaps more disturbing is that Ms. Byrne suggests \\"turning away\\" from the overweight and implies with her other comments that \\"fat thoughts\\" make \\"fat people\\"--and that thin is the ideal. Hello?! Fat/thin is a cultural thing. Go to Mexico and you'll find that roundedness is revered. During the 16th and 17th centuries, voluptuous, curved women were seen as ideal because it represented WEALTH. (Famed painter Peter Paul Rubens created breathtaking portraits of full figured women, which is where we get the term \\"Rubenesque\\".) Ms. Byrne's ignorance is a reflection of Western pop-culture that says stick thin is ideal (she thought 143 pounds was \\"fat\\"!). One could just as easily reason \\"A full figured woman doesn't think FAT thoughts--she thinks thoughts of ABUNDANCE!\\" It's all a matter of how you look at it--and how you feel about yourself. But this kind of prejudice--the only kind that is still perfectly acceptable in Western society--has no place in this book in my opinion. One could easily argue, according to the author's logic, that heroin chic is a reflection of thoughts of depravity, scarcity, and self-hatred!<br /><br />She also states that those who experience widespread calamity (tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, famine, diseases like AIDS, etc.) experience it because they are \\"vibrating\\" in exact alignment with these disasters (such as thinking they could be in the wrong place at the wrong time). I'd like to see Ms. Byrne walk amidst the AIDS suffers in Africa or those in Louisiana who survived Hurricane Katrina and say those things. Oh, wait! That's right. According to her we shouldn't OBSERVE such nasty things. PuhLEEZE! Honey, you can vibrate at a high level, with love and compassion, and NOT be \\"negative\\"--and still offer solace, encouragement and aid. Hell, even Mother Theresa and her amazing work with the lepers was featured in the film! Duh! This kind of stupidity and coldness is what turns people off to the law of attraction. Maybe THAT is why more people \\"don't know about it\\", Ms. Byrne--because The Secret has been tainted by egos like yours instead of left alone to speak for itself! Maybe The Secret has not been hidden, only ignored, because of the chilling narcissism that gets thrown in the mix--contradicting the very wisdom traditions (likethe New Testament) that you conveniently hijack to prove the law of attraction!<br /><br />If Ms. Byrne hadn't contributed those ten or so pages to The Secret, the book would be excellent. How she comes across in those passages--how she \\"vibrates\\"--doesn't jive with the rest of the wonderfully sage, revolutionary, and compassionate revelations offered by the other contributors. So I'd recommend--VERY HIGHLY--that you get The Secret DVD instead. It isn't marred by stupidity, and is an utterly amazing work.<br /><br />However, if you saw the DVD and want a handy reminder of much of the ideas shared in the movie, the book would be a great companion.<br /><br />Note: If you'd like a more scientific and compassionate take on \\"thoughts creating reality\\", try [[ASIN:0743276957 The Intention Experiment]] by Lynne McTaggart. If you're going through some rough times--death of a loved one, illness, emotional upheaval, etc.--I highly recommend [[ASIN:0977679454 Courageous Souls: Do We Plan Our Life Challenges Before Birth?]] by Robert Schwartz.<br /><br />And, I've received a LOT of comments on this review, with some people misunderstanding my comments about the weight issue. In her book [[ASIN:0307339238 A Thousand Names for Joy: Living in Harmony with the Way Things Are]] Byron Katie writes:<br /><br />\\"People ARE perfect just the way they are, however deeply they're suffering, but they don't realize that yet. So when I meet someone who's suffering, I don't say, 'Oh, there's no problem, everything is perfect.' Though I can see that there's never a problem, and I'm available to help him see that, telling him what I see would be unkind. That part of my body is suffering, everything is NOT perfect for him, because he believes it's not. I, too, have been trapped in the torture chamber of the mind. I hear what he thinks he needs, I hear his sadness or despair, and I'm available. That's full-blown activisim.\\"<br /><br />This, dear readers, was my point.<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)med painter Peter Paul Rubens created breathtaking portraits of full figured women, which is where we get the term \\"Rubenesque\\".)

0385513755|5.0|I realize that it is extremely difficult to look past everything that has been written and discussed about this film (lawsuits, documentaries, tv shows, etc...), but it cannot be denied that this book is gripping and entertaining.  I certainly did not go into this book a \\"virgin\\" (no pun intended) of what the subject matter is, nor the general plot.  With that, I was still surprised by how captivated I was.  This is a testament (again, not meant as a pun) to the writing of Dan Brown.  I would also highly recommend purchasing this book in the Special Illustrated Edition.  The pictures really hit home the setting and enhance the experience.  Enjoy..........
B000002BPS|5.0|It was pretty steep to top \\"Smash\\", but the Offspring still managed to pump out an excellent album with \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\"; the last great album to come from the band.  \\"The Meaning of Life\\", \\"Leave It Behind\\", and \\"I Choose\\" are great, while \\"Mota\\", \\"All I Want\\", and \\"Way Down the Line\\" are fist pumping songs that harken back to the Offspring's classic punk days.  Smash single \\"Gone Away\\" is still a great song, and besides the humerous clips \\"Disclaimer\\" and \\"Intermission\\", there's really no real filler tracks here.  \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" is a fantastic look back at a time before the Offspring became mainstream darlings with \\"Americana\\", a time when Dexter Holland's lyrics still had some meaning to them and the chords and riffs weren't written to be radio friendly.  Though there are times when you can sense a nig difference, and a bit of a step down, from the Offspring's earlier, and best, material, \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" still manages to be a superbly crafted disc, with the only real downside being that it has to come to an end.
B000002UVX|2.0|Jimi Hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a power trio, and he thrived in that format.  He inspired other groups to attempt it, with varying degrees of success.  But the Experience was a unit, able to soar on stage in extended live versions of Hendrix's compositions. Had it not been for the demon of discontent within the trio itself (that curses so many otherwise excellent bands), the Experience might have created several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart.<br /><br />The album BAND OF GYPSYS was jarring upon its release to those of us looking for Hendrix to continue to maximize the potential of the Experience.  At the time, loosely associated groups that traded off lengthy lead parts in a more or less generic old-style blues format were common and certainly not original -- much less cutting edge.<br /><br />It's true that Jimi does some respectable work on this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied for him, but there's an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance.  Buddy Miles became a kind of intrusion into the world Jimi had fashioned in his previous work.  On a Hendrix album, songs sung by Buddy Miles didn't move the bar; they did not elucidate Jimi's universe.  Buddy's drum work was simply not in the style of Mitch Mitchell, and that was a large step down from the Experience's innovative grooves in songs like \\"Fire,\\" for example.  Listen to \\"Fire,\\" and then listen to any cut on \\"Band of Gypsys.\\"  Listen to Hendrix's wild half-sung, half-wailed vocals on the previous albums, and then listen to Buddy Miles sing \\"Changes.\\"<br /><br />You can't reconcile the two styles, and that would not be quite so bad if it weren't for the obvious fact that Band of Gypsys, under Buddy Miles' unfortunate influence, were not a step backward toward traditional blues rather than another reach into the future already painted by Jimi's previous work in tracks like \\"Are You Experienced?\\" and \\"Third Stone from the Sun.\\"  Jimi's guitar work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf.<br /><br />Band of Gypsys turned Jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band, which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman Buddy Miles. That's not what people bought a Hendrix album for.<br /><br />It just didn't work very well as a release from what people still considered the Hendrix Experience.  Jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow, and the effect was to make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point.<br /><br />No doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that seemed like an intimate studio groove, but the cohesion of the Experience, the clear creative identity of the Hendrix Experience was not there.  You can say it was as simple as the fact that we missed Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, and that may be true.  But whatever the line-up, people were not entirely ready for Jimi to share his stage with any other would-be featured players.work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf.   <br /> <br />Band of Gypsys turned Jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band, which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman Buddy Miles.

0440237688|5.0|Emotionally charged and relevant politically today.  Simple, powerful book both young and old will love.  A world we all lived in, but grew out of.  Why?  How?  Add it to your childs book list, treat yourself and talk about it.  Great subject matter for the dinner table.  Are we in there?  The ending is inspirational.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|I like John Cusak.  He isn't a great actor but then neither is Tom Cruise and Cusak is more likeable.  This is a movie with a slow begining, a slow middle, and a predictable end, but then most romantic comedies are.  If you are looking for some entertainment that is family friendly, that doesn't have any ridiculous car chases, no mindless desruction of property, no drugs, no gross scenes, and some relatively chaste sex, then this is a movie for you. I liked it, my wife liked it, and it was worth the time on a cold snowy evening.  It ends (predictably) happily and I for one am really tired of seeing death, destruction, dysfunction,drugs, and profanity.  I did think they could have had more dogs, which I think would have added to the film and made the slowness a little more tolerable.  I only gave three stars because this is entertaining but not a really serious \\"film\\" but just a movie -- and an ok one.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I love Gwen but I love Gwen with No Doubt and I  can't wait for them to get back together. I hate her solo albums. The only songs I like are 4 in the morning,  and don't get it twisted.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Superman is my favorite Superhero.I've been Fan Of Superman ever snice I was kid.They a TVShow of Superman That Dean Cain Protrayed Superman & these old Superman movies that Christopher Reeves Protrayed Superman & now Brandon Routh gives his best protrayal of Superman.Lois Lane shold've founded out in this movie that Clark Kent was Superman.I love this movie.And I think that Superman Powers are very cool & especailly that he can fly!!!!
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I am a HUGE Gwen Stefani fan.  I loved song after song on \\"Love, Angel, Music, Baby.\\" In fact, I listen to that whole CD without ever skipping through any tracks because they are all so good. Therefore, I couldn't wait for her new album to come out.  However, L.A.M.B. was a tough act to follow, and she just couldn't pull it off.   <br /> <br />I really want to find something to LOVE -- even like -- about this album because I adore Gwen Stefani. I admire her style and the passion she has for everything she does whether it's singing or designing clothes. \\"Orange County Girl\\", a song I first heard at one of her concerts over a year ago is OK, but nothing spectacular.  It's a far cry from \\"Rich Girl\\", or \\"Harajuku Girls\\" or \\"Hollaback Girl\\" -- although nothing will ever compare to that one!     <br /> <br />I wish I could lie and say \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is good, but unfortunately, it just isn't. It really pains me to give Gwen 1 star, but I'm afraid I have to. <br /> <br />
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I bought \\"The Sweet Escape\\" cd last night.  I must admit  I loved every track on the album.  I was not let down by Gwen at all.  I have been a fan since No Doubt used to open up for Ziggy Marley back in the day.  I have been happy to follow along with the innovative musical career path Gwen has taken.  She has fufilled the ability to quench my thirst for excitement in music.  I know it has been said that her new album was \\"thrown together overnight\\".  That may be true, but if that is the case...she did an ecellent job.  Each song has its own style..and I really feel that I can enjoy the message that she sends out in each song.  She offers the dance tracks that are fun and entertaining ...along with some sincere and lovely tunes that are pouring with Gwens \\"feeling\\" lyrics.  This album came at a needed time in my life and I have already become attached.  If your a true Gwen fan then you too will appreciate her latest accomplishments.   <br />Give it a try !!!!
B00005ATQM|5.0|The best sound for the best band, it's awesome how the drums sound, and the 5 channel mix it's perfect for almost all the song. <br />It's the best dvd-audio (for quaility of sound) that I have.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|This CD is okay, but I would of prefered to hear her beautiful voice singing more traditional Christmas songs. Some of the songs are just weird. It is relaxing to listen to early in the morning or late at night. My husband doesn't like it at all.
B00000G3PA|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching the characters in this movie interact with one another. The one liners were dead on and the comedy lasted throughout the film. I'm excited that Billy Bob and Bruce Willis want to continue working together with upcoming films like the Astronaut Farmer because they showed in this film that they could make us smile.
B00006JIA4|5.0|First off, let me ask you the following.  How many of the following bands/artists do you like: <br /> <br />10cc, AFI, Anthrax, Bad News, Ben Folds Five, Billy Squier, Blind Guardian, Boy George, The Darkness, Def Leppard, Dr. Dre, Dream Theater, Electric Six, Extreme, The Flaming Lips, Foo Fighters, Franz Ferdinand, Gary Numan, George Michael, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Jane's Addiction, Jeff Buckley, Jellyfish, Joan Osborne, Katie Melua, Keane, Marilyn Manson, Meat Loaf, Megadeth, The Melvins, Metallica, Mötley Crüe, Muse, My Chemical Romance, Nirvana, OK Go, Panic! At The Disco, Pharrell Williams, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Robbie Williams, Saga, Scissor Sisters, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Smiths, Sonata Arctica, Sparks, Steve Vai, TNT, Tenacious D, Justin Timberlake, Tori Amos, Trent Reznor, Van Halen, Ween, The White Stripes <br /> <br />Interesting list, eh.  What do these bands and artists have in common?  Even if all were of different genres, they were all influence by Queen.  Yes...your MCR and your RHCP and your Radiohead and your Iron Maiden, hell even Dr. Dre himself!  Chances are from that list you at least like 1 of them (if you don't, then I really don't know what to say).  Queen has been a major band that has made their mark on a ton of genres.  Rock, Pop, some Metal (come on, you know that ending from BR was very metalish). <br /> <br />So this brings us to this kickass collection, and I MEAN KICKASS.  The first Disc contains most of their best-known early work.  While Bohemian Rhapsody is a masterpiece, songs like Don't Stop Me Now, Bicycle Race, and Somebody to Love are very easy to enjoy.  Of course we got classics like We Will Rock You and We are the Champions that well...you should all have heard by now. <br /> <br />Disc 2 has mainly work from their 80s...yes, Under Pressure with David Bowie, my personal favorite I Want To Break Free, the motivational I Want It All, and most importantly, probably one of Queen's best, The Show Must Go On. <br /> <br />Disc 3 is the weakest of the 3 with various covers by Elton John and George Michaels, as well as solo work from our buddies Freddy and Brian.  Even though this may not be as great as the first 2 discs, it's still not all that bad and still worth getting. <br /> <br />For me, it was the first Queen album I got on CDs, with better quality recording than the old reels I had.  If you liked any of the above bands, then you better make sure you give a listen to Queen, the band that influenced them. To me, Queen isn't a band.  They aren't great, they aren't bad.  They are a way of life!
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I didn't even realize this cd was coming out until a few weeks ago.  I listened to the preview on Aol and LOVED it!  I like that she did some slow ballads along with some hip hop.  Gwen has never disappointed me so far.  I like that she takes chances and works with different styles.  There is a song on this cd for every mood of mine.  I like that.  :)
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Long time fan but Miss Stefani takes these scraps from Love Angel Music Baby sessions and becomes a self parody. Like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper et al her cartoon persona and run away slave to fashion status have become greater than her musical output. It's interesting that the record company is promoting this recording like it's new material and accompanying it's release with a tour -- when in fact this B rate materail would have been better served as a L.A.M.B. extras disc. Sad to see artists get consumed with their own hype. This is a low point in her career. And how old is this woman anyway???
6305428425|4.0|I finally rented this one as a free rental to see what some of my collegues were laughing about, and it wasn't that bad. Althought parts were far fetched like landing a helicopter at the reunion, the movie itself is a funny reflection on High School and the Clicks that would develop...and Its a Movie, its meant to be over the top. At least Romy and Michelle were Happy through school and life, although clueless, and thats what matters.  Worth watching at least once, but one I could see on the shelf of many homes.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Happy Feet begins by introducing us to an achingly beautiful world and then takes us on an extraordinary hero's journey filled with laughter, tears, and unconditional love.  It is a rare modern epic that goes far beyond the scope of most recent movies, family or otherwise, with amazing visuals, wonderful music, and simple but meaningful themes.  Be warned: you might actually find yourself responding to this film on an emotional level that could be a little embarrassing.  You might leave dancing- or simply breathless.<br /><br />The film weaves the fantasy of a musical world inhabited by penguins, a poignant and beautiful dream in which each emperor penguin searches for love by singing a unique \\"heartsong\\".  Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) is hatched into this world as one very special individual.  Unlike the others of his kind, Mumble seems to be without any singing ability at all.  Instead he is compelled to express what lives in his heart through an incredible gift for tap dancing (granted to the character by the great Savion Glover through motion capture).  Ever positive despite rejection from his community, sweet Mumble is caught up in a remarkably deep adventure story that grapples with concepts of identity, love, and tolerance while instilling a basic sense of environmentalism.<br /><br />The enormity of this story is quite amazing.  The brilliant George Miller (creator of diverse and artful films from Mad Max to Babe) succeeds in creating what may be one of the most loveable characters ever, and then drives him to the edge of hell and back.  Drawn along in Mumble's wake, we often laugh and sometimes cry with the character as he stumbles into a group of loyal friends (two of which are voiced fantastically by Robin Williams), showers his soul mate with unconditional love, and ultimately seeks out answers to environmental issues that are far bigger than one little penguin.  Nothing, though, could be bigger than Mumble's heart.  Unless you are made of stone, you will fall in love with this character, and you'll be cheering him along for every minute of his struggles.<br /><br />As you come to love Mumble, you will be exposed to elegant themes that are so universal they serve as a kind of mirror.  You'll see some of yourself or someone you love in his struggle to prove that being different can be wonderful.  You'll remember past feelings and childhood fantasies as he shows that love can be worth absolutely everything.  And you'll probably feel at least a little guilty to be a human as you remember the profound and sometimes terrible impact we can have on the many wonderful creatures that surround us.  Fortunately there is a good chance that you will also come out feeling empowered to make the world a little better.<br /><br />All in all, the experience is breathtaking.ou will fall in love with this character, and you'll be cheering him along for every minute of his struggles.   <br /> <br />As you come to love Mumble, you will be exposed to elegant themes that are so universal they serve as a kind of mirror.

Alexander Hartegen is a profressor of Physics at columbia university, always busy with work and checking out new technology. He has managed by chance to get a woman that he wants to marry, although work keeps him tied up much of the time.  But, when he finally pops the question, she is taken from him in an accident.  So, using his knowledge, he becomes obsessed, and achieve building a machine that travels time.  Well, the movie takes off from their, with a decent story line and some good effects, such as Jeremy Irons as the leader of the underground human species in the end and the moon effects.    As with many stories, often I overthink the movie, why did he try only once to change the past before going into the future, why not go back a few more times...or did he and I missed something.  Or there are a thousand other ways to prevent that first accident, why did he do what he did, why not come back and take the gun or something?  Anyhow, don't overthink it, it does have some enjoyable parts and again decent effects and story.
1559408855|5.0|Theres really not much to say if you have read the title, It is true and official.....(look up the official Criterion Blog if my word doesn't seem reliable)for the people who dropped 600.00 or more on this title may not want to believe it which I completely understand...but then again who really drops over 600.00 on a dvd. The day this gem does comes into existence I can finally go on ebay and watch the value of this dvd diminish overnight... Anyway this should not be a shocker...for Die-hard Criterion fans; we have noticed this trend from Criterion for the past three years. They have been dipping into their old titles and revamping them with the utmost effort to ensure pristine quality and astonishing HD transfers, These include: \\"The Wages of Fear\\", \\"Brazil\\", \\"M\\", \\"Playtime\\", \\"Amarcord\\", \\"Grey Gardens\\", and soon to be coming, \\"Yojimbo\\" and \\"Sanjuro\\". Re-releasing Salo in a Beautiful HD transfer should not come as a shocker since it is the most sought out dvd in the world, not too mention Criterion only produced 2,000 copies back in 1998. At any rate, The Criterion Collection is working with the HD transfer right now, as far as supplements are concerned, that information remains to be announced in the near future, however, at least we know that  this valuable gem is recieving the correct and proper treatment. For such a limited release and controversial movie I am almost 100% positive if not 110% sure that Criterion will not dissapoint us as usual. All of their re-issues so far have been superior in ever aspect, transfers, supplements, and essays you name it. Salo in general, was a bare bones release; no trailer, no commentaries, nothing..just the movie. Criterion will go all out with this release..imagine...a double disc...with a 70 page booklet would be nice...but we will have to wait in 2007 won't we....  Well, The Criterion Collection has some exciting new releases coming up, Blu Ray releases in the Fall of 2008, and some nice re-releases as well as new additions, \\"High and Low\\", \\"Vampyr\\" \\"Botttle Rocket\\" and a new \\"walkabout\\", however, the biggest news is that SALO' is finally here folks, well officially in August 2008, but the official Specs are here, so with that in mind, SALO' Fans indulge in the new revamped special features, and for the previous owners of SALO' with the White ring Version, that may or may not have cost them 400-800 dollars, I am sorry, but this re-release was inevitable, so the most valuable dvd in the world is no more!!:- SPECIAL EDITION DOUBLE-DISC SET FEATURES:  - New, restored high-definition digital transfer The End of Salò, a 40-minute documentary about the film's final scene  - Salò: Yesterday and Today, a 35-minute documentary featuring interviews with Pier Paolo Pasolini, actor-filmmaker Jean-Claude Biette, and Pasolini's friend Nineto Davoli  - New interviews with set designer Dante Ferretti and filmmaker/film scholar Jean-Pierre Gorin  - Optional English-dubbed soundtrack  - Theatrical trailer  - Optional English subtitles  - PLUS: A booklet featuring new essays by Neil Bartlett, Roberto Chiesi, Naomi Greene, Gary Indiana, and Sam Rohdie, and excerpts from Gideon Bachman's on-set diary
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|First off, I love all these reviews, whether you liked the album or not.  Critique is good.  Anyway, like most die-hard Incubus fans, Crow was a stifling lesson in monotony and repetition (not what we were expecting).  When I first heard Light Grenades I originally jumped to the same conclusion.  Yet I forced myself to continue listening to it out of pure devotion to the band.  After several listens the subtle complexities of the music began to shine through and I realized how wonderful this album just might be.  Several prior reviewers hit the nail on the head.  Incubus is an ever-changing band.  That, at least for me, is what keeps drawing me back. I find it refreshing, and that is exactly what this album is becomming to me.  Don't give up on this album.  Its beauty is hidden, and it takes devotion to discover it.  P.S  Mike is probably one of the most under-rated guitarist of all time.  So fast.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie came 400 years too late. We might've belived in all this nonsense in the 14th century but for an adult to be brainwashed to the extent that they actually take this fairytale for real is scary. You don't belive in Zeus. You're an atheist to Poseidon and Allah. So you know what it's like to be an atheist. Normal people just go one god further.
B00004W510|5.0|When I say that this is the most thoroughly American<br /><br />album I ever heard, I am very much aware that The<br /><br />Band is 80% Canadian.And it doesn't matter, there<br /><br />is a combination of twangy anglo harmonies, energetic<br /><br />playing and make-your-feet-move energy that's just<br /><br />pure Americana.<br /><br />Best yet, it's an American sound that's undiluted by<br /><br />a lot of 'virtuoso' solos on guitar or drums or a bunch<br /><br />of electronic gimrackery. The subject matter helps too.<br /><br />Rag, Mama, Rag just sounds like it belongs in some<br /><br />low-ceilinged country joint on a Saturday night. The<br /><br />Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down and King Harvest almost<br /><br />sound like history lessons.<br /><br />I seem to remember that this album and the equally<br /><br />luscious Big Pink didn't get a whole lot of air<br /><br />play. Too offbeat, I guess. But everybody I knew back<br /><br />then had these two albums and the covers were the ones<br /><br />with the most wear and tear and the disks had the<br /><br />most turntable-induced hiss.<br /><br />Stand the test of time? Well, my, yes. And next to the<br /><br />blues, there's nothing more home-grown.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE  and<br /><br />the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN 9781601640005
B000J103PC|5.0|Yes, we have seen the storyline before.  So What??  Almost every movie Hollywood has been making in the last 20 years are \\"new\\" versions of old storylines.  But this is an enjoyable film, and I think the director did a great job.  \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\\"  Isn't it easy to fall into the trap?  Andy, of good intentions, does what every job seeker does: to please the boss.  And yet the road to success is never easy, and one minute you think you know yourself and your choices, yet somehow, without any meaning to, you find yourself on a completely different path than the one you started out with.<br /><br />Some of you have bosses that are easy to please.  I have met and worked with bosses like Miranda Priestly, and it's true, there are people like that in the world.  Meryl Streep did a fantastic job of conveying such a tyrannical boss.<br /><br />And Anne Hatheway is beautiful.  Audrey Hepburn will never be replaced. But among the stars of today, Anne Hathaway is MILES ABOVE stars like J. Lo, Britney Spears, and all those stars who think they are stars, but are nothing but crap.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is a much better role model than Britney Spears or J. Lo, Anne is definitely elegant, refined, and a lady.  And we need more actresses who portray good manners, good breeding and good education.<br /><br />Just because the way the ending is not a bang, doesn't mean it's a bad movie.  Every time when we make a right decision, there won't be fireworks going off, or large celebrations to tell us we are right, and I think a lot of people are confused about that.  They think that's what the movies should always provide.<br /><br />In real life, assistants cannot afford to dress like Anne did in the movies.  But we are in a movie.  So just enjoy it for what it is.  A great movie that reminds us: choose the real important things in life vs. choose the frivolous things in life like fame, fashion and glamour, which fades in an instant..
B000I5X81K|2.0|Josh has an amazing voice, and as a long-time fan I am sad to say this album is a far cry from the first two. A very different choice of songs that appears generic and is lacking his usual passion. And what is up with the lullaby? What saves this CD are the very good italian songs, oozing with passion and Josh's usual refinement. Bottomline: if you're not into poppy Josh, don't buy this CD, or if you do, get the extended version with \\"Verita\\" another very good italian song.

1594200823|2.0|I loved Pollan's \\"Botany of Desire,\\" which is full of interesting ideas and new perspective.  So I had high hopes for \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\".  I was terribly disappointed.  I found this book often dull, repetitive, and thinly and superficially researched.  Pollan aims to present a perspective on industrial vs. small scale agriculture and food production, mostly from a very personal and subjective point of view.  I think that by and large Pollan finds his own reactions and impressions much more interesting than the scientific or economic foundations of the topic that he is studying.  Others may enjoy this, but I don't.  The technical facts take a back seat -- and many of the facts he mentions are actually only half true at best.  Large sections of the book, especially toward the latter half, are dedicated entirely to Pollan's own navel-gazing as he considers his own cooking, whether he should become a vegetarian, the smell of a dead animal, etc.  It just gets dull.  Pollan also pads out the chapters by repeating certain ideas and phrases over and over:  how many times do we have to read that the free ranging chickens laid \\"tasty eggs\\"?  This is one of those books that would be twice as good if it were only half as long. Meanwhile he barely touches some of the key issues -- What are the implications of an industrial food chain that is essentially a machine for converting fossil fuel energy into food calories?  Can a traditional midwestern corn farmer actually convert to an \\"organic\\" or artisanal model of food production?  That's what I'd like to know, and I certainly didn't learn it from this book.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|I am a major Beatles fan and the walls of my office at work evidence that.  After the reading the early reviews talking about a whole new way of hearing the Beatles, I was anticipating this album with great relish.  But overall, it is quite underwhelming.  The sound quality is magnificent; leaving me frustrated that albums like Abbey Road have not been released in surround sound.  But the work of the Martins, pere et fils in reassembling Beatles songs shows little real innovation.  The \\"progressive\\" development of Strawberry Fields is a work of art and  the accoustic version of Guitar Weeping is disarming, but otherwise the only really new features are conjunctions and overlaps of various instrumental parts.  After countless hearings of the original albums, it is nice to hear the songs in a different order, breaking up the sense of expection, but otherwise, I found this album to be a disappointment.
B00005JLFC|5.0|Yentl is a fine, wonderful film.  One of the few modern pictures of the \\"Broadway musical\\" style, it rivals the best of the genre.  Streisand is excellent in the role of a poor Jewish girl with the simple aspiration to be free to follow her heart and mind.  She leverages both her good dramatic and excellent comedic skills.  Each of the characters are so richly presented and played, from the ladies in the fish market to the bookseller, from the students at yeshiva to the colleague/suitor (Avigdor, played so well by Mandy Patinkin).  Outstanding casting, film work, writing.  And the music ... oh, the music.  Streisand at her very best.  Have seen the film a dozen times and won't soon tire of this modern classic.  Oh yes:  bring this out on DVD (original, director's format), please!
B000J103YI|5.0|I saw the broadway show and have not been the same since.  I wore out 2 lps of the soundtrack and play the cd at least once a month.  This soundtrack uses the original score and brings it out with great respect.  WOW!  Now I know why it took so many years to do it justice.  I'll probably watch the movie when it is on cable.  I could care less of the \\"hollywood\\" treatment with stars.   I don't want to spoil the experience of a sparse stage and great music to tell a story.  I'll never forget when Jennifer Holliday sings, \\"And I'm telling you...\\" and she looks every person in the audience in the eye.  It still gives me chills.
B000E8N690|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I've not been a huge fan of \\"The Man in Black\\" until recently.  I learned a whole lot about Johnny Cash.  Honestly this was a very touching movie, and it has something for everyone, whether you're a die hard fan of his, or someone like me.  I highly reccomend buying this movie for yourself, and for anyone you know that is, or has ever been a fan of Johnny Cash.

B000089770|5.0|There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all <br />occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special <br />effects, others the story. <br /> <br />In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are <br />keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the <br />movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a <br />glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a <br />small 7-11 style store in a major city. <br /> <br />William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own, <br />and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the <br />tough-guy with a big heart role. <br /> <br />The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies, <br />such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION <br />but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that <br />will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those <br />over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of <br />human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles <br />that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods. <br />The key here, is showing people their human sides, and <br />willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in <br />peace with one another, responsibly. <br /> <br />Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed <br />with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in <br />each moment, are not the norm, considering the \\"fantasy\\" <br />or \\"unreal\\" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target <br />the below 17 age bracket. <br /> <br />Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to <br />enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting <br />talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel. <br /> <br />As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my <br />favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in <br />this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not <br />unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd <br />that we used to see, in other movies of the same period, <br />such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon, <br />or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances <br />with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a <br />different phase of her life than before, but in <br />SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your <br />attention. <br /> <br />In terms of the DVD edition, the colors, sharpness of the <br />picture and audio, is top-notch. <br />
B000JJRIN4|3.0|My mom's a huge Stefani fan, so naturally I purchased her the new album.  After two days of listening we both agree that it's not quite as good as her debut.  This album is really \\"beat\\" focused.  There's a lot of classical African drums in here, and that gives it a lot of danceable tracks.  Good balance of different types of music on the CD.  But I just think her first album is so much better.  Being an artist is hard.
B00005JPCY|2.0|Even Denzel is entitled to the occasional flop.<br /><br />Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington), an agent with the ATF, arrives on the scene of a horrific ferryboat explosion in New Orleans. As the various agencies investigate the cause of death of hundreds, including many service people, Carlin lets his senses lead him to the bridge crossing the Mississippi. There, he discovers a possible accelerant, confirming the explosion was probably caused deliberately. He soon meets FBI Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who introduces Carlin to a special project he is working on with Denny (Adam Goldberg), Shanti (Erika Alexander) and Gunnars (Elden Henson). They appear to have a very sophisticated surveillance system set up and they give Carlin a story about how they are able to amass information from surveillance cameras at various locations, to provide a look four days into the past. But Carlin realizes they have more than that; they are able to zoom in, move through walls, hear Claire (Paula Patton) talk. Claire, a victim who washes up before the accident happened, and deliberately made to look like a victim of the ferryboat explosion, becomes their number one lead. As they watch her, Carlin becomes suspicious and soon learns this ragtag group of people has created a time machine of sorts, but it can only look four days in the past. Soon, they decide to send a letter to Carlin, two days before the accident, leading him to the potential terrorist, Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel). But Carlin's partner gets the message instead, leading to a dangerous situation. But if they can send a printed message to the past, couldn't they send something larger?<br /><br />\\"D&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\", directed by Tony Scott (and from the first frame you will recognize it as one of his films) and written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio (he was one of the writers of \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\"), sets up its own logic, which is fine in a fiction film, but in the end, it cheats on its own rules, robbing the film of any suspense it may have been able to generate. Part of the point of working in fiction is that you are able to set up your own rules, govern your new universe. If you have to cheat on yourself for the climax, you haven't done that good a job setting up the universe in the first place.<br /><br />As soon as Denzel struts into the middle of the crime scene, you have hope for the film. Perhaps it will turn out okay. Just perhaps. And Washington is Washington. He has played cops in numerous films and this is no exception to that work; he is a commanding presence, forceful and mesmerizes you on the screen. As Carlin, he appears to have seen many crime scenes, adding both experience and world weariness to his persona. As soon as he arrives, he lets his instinct lead him to the nearby bridge and the discovery. Then he has an assistant pull surveillance tapes and immediately spots the motorcycle driver who stops at the side of the bridge, at the same time as the accident.<br /><br />But as soon as Carlin comes into contact with Pryzwarra and his team, the story moves into a more fantastical realm. The film has to work hard to make us believe what is happening. To accomplish this, the filmmakers have created a scene in which Carlin watches surveillance tapes of Claire. Okay. That could work. But the scene goes on for an eternity, as Carlin watches this character move through her life and we hear him bark instructions at the team. \\"Can we move in?\\" \\"What is she reading?\\" This leads to quick intercut shots of hands moving joysticks, cameras zooming in, etc. The shots of Claire are given a high tech treatment, which does little to disguise the fact that we are simply watching another character without interacting in her life. Worse, Carlin is doing the same, simply watching her as a passive observer. It doesn't make for the most exciting viewing. However, the filmmakers also want us to believe Carlin is becoming attracted to her, simply by watching her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this scene also occurs at the beginning of the second act. Many action films fall into the trap of a slow second act; the detective is investigating, the wrongly accused man is trying to prove his innocence. Generally, this is where the writer's and director start to kick in the story. The first act had some good action, here is why. Hopefully, the third act will wrap things up with a bang. But just watching another character is not very interesting.<br /><br />Naturally, with a time travel slant on the story, whatever happens in the beginning of the film will be revisited during the conclusion. But this time, the hero will be participating. Carlin is now part of the action, racing to stop Carroll from blowing up the ferry boat and all of those service men ready to party in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. Now attached to Claire, he gives her a specific set of instructions, mainly stay off the boat, but she has seen one too many damsel in distress films and naturally doesn't follow his instructions, making herself a liability to his actions.<br /><br />I can't really tell you how \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\" cheats, because I would have to reveal the ending. But how lazy is it for writers to create their own set of rules and then cheat on them. If you realize the rules aren't going to work, change them at the beginning of the story. Make them work. That's what you do when you are writing a piece of fiction. If you make the rules, your universe, and the people's actions believable enough, the audience will go along for the ride. Because the writers didn't bother to work out these details, the film is even more of a letdown than it needed to be.<br /><br />As soon as the first frame of film hits the screen, you will recognize this as a Tony Scott film. I could tell from the first moment of the trailer. No other filmmaker appears to have been so clearly influenced by MTV and made it his signature style. Scott rarely uses one shot when he can use one shot. In the beginning of the film, and near the end of the third act, Scott's camera lingers over various servicemen, jovial with anticipation for the upcoming Mardi Gras celebration. There's an officer with his wife and small daughter. There is a group of school children with their teacher. There is an elderly couple, ready for a vacation. There is a woman passing out beads to more service men. Rather than show a single shot of the officer, his wife and their child, Scott's camera lingers on them for seconds, then jerks away and we then see the same thing from a slightly different angle, before jerking away again. Few shots are static or longer then a couple of seconds. Perhaps Scott thinks this will imbue a sense of drama within his film. It merely resembles an overlong music video.<br /><br />Tony, no amount of camera work or over editing will help disguise the problems inherent in a bad screenplay. If your story is good, you don't need to do this type of thing all the time.<br /><br />The one good thing about the film is that it is set in New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina. In one scene, they follow a lead into the Ninth Ward and the cameras reveal the devastation still prevalent in that area. Perhaps this will help call some attention to the fact that the city still has large areas of destruction, where the garbage hasn't even been cleared up, and the rebuilding has yet to begin. But in order for that to happen, people would have to see the film. I don't think a lot of people are going to see \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\".

0375713751|4.0|I'm frankly embarrassed for the (presumably female)reviewers who say they've taken offense to this book's main character and theme. You give yourselves away; hate to say it, but I've never heard a man get all bent out of shape (emotionally wounded?) about a fictional character because \\"that's not me or anyone I know.\\" I saw the word \\"agenda\\" in a few of those reviews. Oh get over it. Are Reddy and her judgements and actions a bit to the extreme? Sure. That's why they call it FICTION. That's why her FICTIONAL life is a bestselling story and your real life isn't. Your real life wouldn't be interesting enough!:) I only saw one review that acTually criticised the mechanics/writing style of the book and not just the book's supposed agenda. <br /> <br />That said, I'm not a big fan of the Bridget Jones genre (not as a main literary diet anyway), but this book gave me a funny, entertaining and quick read when I wanted it. The character was complex enough to keep me reading; She was very human in her thoughts and feelings; I understood her though I disagreed with many of her thoughts and actions.  <br /> <br />The ending (won't spoil it) seemed a bit tacked on; it came almost too quickly and easily once I got there, hence the lack of another star. And for me, occasionally the witty banter of the cab driver seemed a bit contrived. But, oh well. Overall I liked it. Would recommend it to anyone but an overly sensitive friend who is always looking for the \\"agenda\\".
B000JJRIN4|1.0|You are not \\"ghetto', you are not \\"down\\", you're not crunk, bling-bling or whatever mumbling derelict phrases are popular nowadays among a crowd whose collective IQ is 2.  The only black person you know is the guy who drives your limo.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is by far my all time favorite movie. It is what most call an \\"idealistic\\" film that centers around a futuristic England where all chaos has been forcefully put to an end. In a world where disease, crime, and hatred became so rampant in America, a man by the name of Adam Sutler invented the role of high chancellor, and performed \\"cleansing\\" in England by initiating strict rules to create a seemingly perfect, \\"Godly\\", nation. The writers of this script wanted to show what could happen if our nation continues in the downword spiral we are in. They showed that the justice system can never be without flaw when Evey, the main character in the film, is out past the twelve o'clock curfew. She is confronted by a group of fingermen, who are the police of the nation, and they surround her. They threaten to beat and abuse her when \\"V\\", the defender of the innocent and punisher of the unjust, steps in and rescues Evey. This is just one example of how this movie shows the flaws in human nature. This movie was amazingly well written and directed. The characters and lines were powerful and moving. This is the kind of movie you think quote for days after you watch it. This is a movie that makes you want to change the world. <br />

When many people suffer from delusion it is called religion\\"!    How true is that! This statement appears on page 5 of this brilliant book. I would like to give this book a 10 star rating just for exposing religion for what it really is, a sinister force.   Good work Mr. Dawkins!
B00003CX9E|2.0|For years I had heard of this Citizen Kane movie. I heard that it was the one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film of all time. But I had always had my doubts on this movie. It seems to me that almost every film that people consider \\"classics\\" or \\"masterpieces\\" are nothing more than overrated, over-hyped films that aren't that great to begin with. After finally watching \\"Citizen Kane\\" for the first time, I must say that my opinion about these \\"classic\\" films are still the same. I went into this film with an open mind, really expecting a good movie, but that's not what I got. I got quite a long, boring film with a weak plot and storyline. Heck, I knew what \\"Rosebud\\" meant 15 minutes before the movie ended!!I found myself not caring about any of the characters at all, especially Kane. As many people have already written, I do give credit to Welles for the inovatitive camera angles and some creative lines of dialogue here and there, but I see NOTHING in the this movie that would make me think that this movie is ANYWHERE NEAR one of the greatest films of all time.
B00062J00S|3.0|Why hate this movie?      Well, a lot of the values it trumpets are dated, to say the least.  In Bedford Falls (the \\"good\\" universe) women and blacks are only around to work for the white men.  We're not supposed to mind that a 12 year old is left unsupervised to watch a store, or that the adult George drives drunk, or that he lets Potter refer to his friends as \\"a bunch of garlic eaters,\\" and we're supposed to think it's cute and funny that an 18 year old smacks the rear end of his adult (black and female) servant.  And then there are some values that no one seems to latch on to. (You'd think all the people who love \\"Wonderful Life\\" would have noticed that the wedding was small and inexpensive and copied it.  You don't hear about people doing that, though.)     In the \\"bad\\" universe of Pottersville, blacks can be musicians and women can have careers. (And why does Mary never getting married lead to an almost unibrow?)    But the themes that one life can be important, that the love of family is precious, that friends can BE family, get me every time.      BTW, the French translation on the DVD is quite good, with the actors doing the dubbing working hard to sound like the characters and not just people reading.
B00005JPCA|4.0|**Beware - May Contain Spoilers** <br /> <br />James Bond, the billion dollar movie character created by Ian Fleming makes his highly anticipated return to the screen in \\"Casino Royale\\".  After a long, drawn out search with the names of some of Hollywood's elite being tossed around as possible contenders to step into the infamous 007 shoes (and tux), British actor Daniel Craig was chosen. <br /> <br />\\"Casino Royale\\" starts off with the super agent making his second kill, a requirement in order to achieve his \\"double O\\" status.  Bond's next order of business puts him on the trail of a bomb maker in Madagascar.  After being admonished by M (Judi Dench) for the way things unraveled (and for breaking into her home), Bond follows the trail to the Bahamas where he meets Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his wife Solange (Caterina Murino).  He soon learns the scheme that Dimitrios is involved in:  to blow up one of the world's premiere jetliners in Miami.  Bond, however, has other plans and foils the plot.   <br /> <br />From there M informs 007 of the deadly Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), who lost a considerable amount of money when the jet's demise went awry.  Now desperate to get back the money, Le Chiffre plans an elaborate poker tournament.  With Bond as MI6\\"s best card player, they have no choice but to send him to Montenegro and back him in the tournament.  However, he doesn't go alone.  To make sure their initial investment of $10 million is secure, MI6 sends Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to keep an eye on their assets. <br /> <br />Once in Montenegro, the duo, who are supposed to pose as a couple madly in love, meet Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), a field agent and later on, a CIA operative who is also in the poker tournament, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright).  As the tournament intensifies, Bond and Vesper find themselves endangered when allies may not be who they appear to be.  Will Bond be able to stop Le Chiffre?  You'll have to watch \\"Casino Royale\\" to find out. <br /><br />With all of the press (some good and some bad) that's been surrounding not only the movie but also the announcement of a new Bond, this had to be one of the most anticipated movies of the year.  Film fans looking for an action packed 007 flick will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />There were plenty of things that I liked about this one.  From the chase at the beginning of the movie to the scene where Le Chiffre is torturing Bond and even through the underwater sequences near the end, the movie is nothing short of intense.  But the film is not without its unique comedic timing particularly Bond's banter with M (when she threatens to have him killed if he reveals her true first name) and at other times with Vesper Lynd.  There are also a few funny moments with Mathis who seems to really enjoy his job! <br /> <br />In \\"Casino Royale\\" we see a Bond that wasn't infallible.  Since Bond is new to the 007 gig, he does make mistakes and at times looses his cool.  We especially see this during the poker tournament when he, at one point, underestimates Le Chiffre. <br /> <br />I also believe sometimes less is more.  The movie has almost no special effects and relies less on the gadgetry which were a bit detrimental to some of the previous Bond films.  This time around you're focused more on the story and what the people are up to on screen. <br /> <br />The cast was also good and seemed to mesh well together.  Daniel Craig gives a good, solid performance as Bond as does Eva Green in the femme fatale role of Vesper Lynd.  It was also nice to see a little more screen time with Judi Dench as M.  A Bond film needs a truly memorable nemesis and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre delivers on this. <br /> <br />There were a couple of things I would like to have seen in the movie.  There's only a brief introduction to Felix Leiter in the film so a little more screen time would have been nice, but probably not necessary in the scheme of things.  Also, at times, the poker tournament seemed to drag on a little. <br /> <br />I questioned three other things about the movie.  Was Mathis really working for the enemy?  Where did Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) fit into all this?  \\"Casino Royale\\" never really answers this.  It could be assumed that these are cliffhangers that will be answered in the next Bond installment due out in 2008. <br /> <br />My other question is (and this one is a major spoiler in case you want to stop reading here...), what were Vesper Lynd's true intentions/motivations?  One could argue that she really had feelings for James (who's about to leave MI6 for her) while another plausible view is that she schemed against him the entire time for the sake of her kidnapped boyfriend (who we're never told if he is released or murdered).  These are just minor things and do not detract from the overall movie. <br /> <br />There's a lot to live up to with any 007 film.  \\"Casino Royale\\" delivers plenty of punch and helps to pave the way for the new direction that the Bond franchise is headed in with Daniel Craig.  <br /> <br />\\"Casino Royale\\" runs 144 minutes and is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action, scene of torture, sexual content and nudity. <br /> <br />

FURTHERMORE, MANY OF YOU IDIOTS ARE VERY MISINFORMED.  <br />I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOME OF YOU ARE COMPARING HER TO JLO. THEY ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ARTISTS. MARIAH'S FIRST CAREER IS HER MUSIC & JLO'S FIRST CAREER IS ACTING. THERE IS NO COMPARISON -JUST STOP THE NONSENSE.  <br />IT IS ALSO SO IGNORANT WHEN PEOPLE SAY MC IS CRAZY. JUST BECAUSE SHE IS A CELEBRITY DOESN'T MEAN SHE IS EXEMPT FROM FACING THE SAME OBSTACLES IN LIFE THAT THE REST OF US DO. SHE WENT THROUGH A HARD TIME AND MADE IT THROUGH. THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERYONE'S LIFE WHEN WE HAVE TO FACE HURDLES, IT'S HOW WE GET OURSELVES THROUGH THEM THAT IS IMPORTANT. IT MAKES US HUMAN AND HUMBLES US. MARIAH SURVIVED IT LIKE A CHAMP.  <br />& YES, MARIAH IS THE BIGGEST SELLING FEMALE ARTIST. NO OTHER ARTIST (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE THE BEATLES & ELVIS) HAS EVER SOLD 150 MILLION ALBUMS. MADONNA HAS SOLD APPROXIMATELY 100 MILLION, HOWEVER THAT IS OVER A 25 YEAR SPAN. WHEREAS, MARIAH SURPASSED THIS NUMBER BY SEVERAL MILLION IN ONLY A 10-15 YR. SPAN. IT'S SIMPLE MATH.  <br />& FOR THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE CRITICIZING HER FOR RE-RELEASING THE PLATINUM EDITION - WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE? OBVIOUSLY, YOU ARE NOT TRUE MC FANS. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HER RE-RELEASING THE ALBUM WAS FOR HER HARD-CORE FANS LIKE MYSELF. I WOULDN'T CARE IF SHE RE-RELEASED IT 5X'S. IT NOT ONLY INCLUDES 4 ADDITIONAL TRACKS THAT ARE OFF THE HOOK, BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES A DVD. & TO THE REVIEWER THAT SAID SHE RE-RELEASED IT 3X'S YOU ARE SO MISTAKEN. SHE DID RELEASE ANOTHER FORMATTED COPY OF THE CD, BUT IT WAS RELEASED THE SAME DAY AS THE ORIGINAL. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE PACKAGING (ONE INCLUDING A FULL SIZED POSTER) & IT IS UP TO THE CONSUMER TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE TO PURCHASE. & AGAIN, WHY DO YOU IDIOTS EVEN CARE. OH, & BUY THE WAY MC IS NOT THE ONLY ARTIST WHO HAS RE-RELEASED THEIR ALBUM (LET'S SEE JLO, USHER, JESSICA S., ALICIA KEYS.... & THE LIST GOES ON). I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE RECORD COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE FINAL SAY AS TO WHAT TRACKS WILL BE INCLUDED THE ALBUMS. IF THE ALBUM SELLS WELL THEN THE MARKETING SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY KICKS IN GEAR AND THE LABEL DECIDES TO RE-RELEASE THE ALBUMS WITH ADDITIONAL TRACKS, ETC.  <br />GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT BEFORE DISSING ON MC.  <br />THE ADDITIONAL TRACKS ON THE PLATINUM EDITION ARE OFF THE HOOK & WELL WORTH THE $. ALSO, I PURCHASED THE PLATINUM AT WALMART FOR ONLY 9 BUCKS. THE ADDITIONS ARE GREAT R&B TRACKS WITH MESMERIZING BEATS, GREAT REMIXES, & THE OH SO BEAUTIFUL \\"DON'T FORGET ABOUT US\\".  <br />SO TO THE HATERS - SCREW YUS ALL.....ACTUALLY, IT'S QUITE COMICAL READING YOUR REVIEWS, BECAUSE THEY ARE SO IGNORANT, INACCURATE, AND MEANINGLESS. <br />
B000J3EEBY|5.0|An Ancient Muse, Loreena McKennitt's long-awaited recording, has arrived and it continues a strikingly original, visionary musical path that began with her 1991 breakthrough The Visit, and evolved with 1994's The Mask and Mirror and 1997's The Book of Secrets.       What distinguishes An Ancient Muse has more to do with its fine points than the breaking of new musical ground.  When listened to as one program, it is a beautifully sequenced, cohesive and at times breathtaking musical adventure.  But each of the nine selections that comprise the album stands perfectly on its own.     While the CD is marketed as \\"Rock/Pop\\", Loreena's musical genre is altogether her own. There are elements of Celtic, Middle Eastern and other \\"World\\" influences, as well as Classical, folk and pop forms in her music.  But what sets her apart from other artists is the spell-casting she performs, weaving exotic rhythms, tones and colors with evocative and intelligent lyrics that echo ancient traditions and mythologies.      An Ancient Muse is Loreena McKennitt's personal investigation of a people--the Celtic people, their roots, their branches, and how they touch one another, ancestrally and contemporarily.  \\"We are the culmination of our collective histories,\\" say McKennitt, \\"and there should be more to bind us than tear us apart.\\"  This exploration is also an elevation of human experience.      I can think of no other contemporary artist who offers such an intoxicating potion of intellect, beauty and grace in a form so exotic, heartfelt and compelling.  [...]
B000I5X80G|3.0|Make no mistake about it, the music on this disc deserves a big 5 stars in terms of sound quality, musicianship, and historical significance.  It is just that for the price I think they should have included the opening solo acoustic set, and at the very least the encore performance of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", one of Neil's pivotal songs.  Charge me more, but give me that.  My other gripe is the packaging:  the first live release of the original line-up of Crazy Horse, and no liner notes from Neil, only an excerpt from a miniscule contemporary newspaper review of the concert.  In Decade, his anthology set, Neil wrote liner notes in his own hand, but there is nothing like that here.  Also, the CD doesn't come in a jewel case, but in one of those paper/cardboard retro gatefolds that are supposed to recreate the way LP covers used to be.  Only problem with this in the digital world is that it is awkward to remove the CD from the sleeve, and the gatefold will NEVER LIE FLAT, which makes it difficult for storage purposes.  I apologize for being so petty in regard to the above.  But all of that aside , this CD absolutely rocks and is indispensable if you are a Neil Young fan.
1572522089|4.0|\\"Ran\\" which can be translated in Japanese as \\"Coup\\" or \\"Upheaval\\" sums this film up perfectly.  The story is of a Warlord who wants to slow down in old age and give the reins of leadership to his oldest son.  Almost immediately, the weak minded eldest son gets pressured by his vengeful wife to betray his father's trust.  The resulting war is as beautiful as it is graphic.  It made me think \\"Braveheart\\" in Japan.  I watched the DVD and I do have one problem with it however, and that is lack of features.  It is not very easy to use chapter search as there are only a few chapters included, so finding scenes is a little hard.  Features are bare-boned, but I would say that the film definitely more than makes up for it.

B00005JPCA|5.0|CASINO ROYALE is a reboot in the finest sense of the word.  It picks up the slouching James Bond series and not only stands it up straight - it also works it out and beats it until it can do more pushups than Sylvester Stallone on steroids.  After the 20th James Bond screen adventure, DIE ANOTHER DAY, was released in 2002 (forty years after the first 007 thriller, DR. NO), it seemed as though the series could run for a while longer on pure popcorn entertainment, though the dwindling originality and the increasingly stereotypical nature of the films was becoming obvious.  Still, it wasn't clear just how near death the franchise was until CASINO ROYALE. <br />  <br />A brief history lesson: in 1961, Ian Fleming, the author of the best-selling James Bond novels, sold the screen rights to his novels to producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli.  There was one novel that Saltzman and Broccoli couldn't get the rights to, however: CASINO ROYALE, the first James Bond novel.  Fleming had sold the rights to that novel years earlier when it was adapted as an episode of the American TV series CLIMAX! (starring Barry Nelson as James Bond, with Peter O'Toole as Le Chiffre!); it was also used as the basis for the insane 1967 spy spoof starring Peter Sellers, Woody Allen, and David Niven as James Bond (yes, all three played James Bond). <br />  <br />Flash forward 38 years: Sony now owns the rights to CASINO ROYALE, while MGM owns the rights to all the other Bond books.  Flash forward a few years more: Sony buys MGM, thus giving current Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli the chance to finally adapt the first ever James Bond adventure for the big screen.  Reacting to fan criticism over the more recent Bond adventures' over-the-top \\"world domination\\" storylines and ridiculous gadgetry, Wilson and Broccoli decided to take a page from BATMAN BEGINS' book and \\"reboot\\" the franchise.  They brought in Paul Haggis, the Academy Award-winning writer of CRASH and MILLION DOLLAR BABY, to co-write the screenplay, and in an extremely controversial move, they released Pierce Brosnan and hired Daniel Craig to play 007. <br />  <br />The fan complaints were too numerous to list.  He's blonde!  He looks haggard!  He's not suave, he's just cold!  He's going to be the next George Lazenby! <br /> <br />Then they saw the film. <br />  <br />CASINO ROYALE isn't a prequel, as it's set in the present, but it is a new beginning for the forty-years-old-plus series.  In CASINO ROYALE, James Bond has just received his Double-O status; to become a Double-O, you must have had to kill two people in the line of duty, as explained in a pre-credits sequence stylishly filmed in black and white.  Bond makes a critical error chasing down a gun-for-hire, and is told by an enraged M. (Judi Dench, reprising her role from Pierce Brosnan's Bond adventures) to stick his head in the sand somewhere.  As we all know, though, James Bond never takes a vacation; instead, he travels to the Bahamas, where he follows the trail of the gun-for-hire - a trail which leads him to Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a notorious banker for the world's terrorists.  Bond goes undercover to compete in a high-stakes poker tournament at the \\"Casino Royale\\".  His mission: bankrupt Le Chiffre.  If this were Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, or Pierce Brosnan, you'd say \\"No problem!\\".  But Daniel Craig's Bond is a far more realistic and human Bond; nothing comes as easy to him as it did to the previous 007s. <br />  <br />As a big fan of Ian Fleming's novels - CASINO ROYALE in particular - I had low expectations for this film.  Imagine my surprise when I walked out of the theater and realized that CASINO ROYALE wasn't simply the best Bond film in five years, ten years, twenty years even: it's the best Bond film ever made.  Daniel Craig surpasses even the god of 007 actors, Sean Connery, whom I previously thought was unsurpassable.  Craig has virtually nothing in common with any previous Bond actor, but he is precisely the 007 of Fleming's novels.  He exudes smoldering masculinity, but in a way less egotistic than the previous Bond actors.  His Bond makes errors, as established in a brilliant chase scene at the start of the film; he doesn't always win, and he lets his temper get the best of him far too often.  He's still a master of knockout one-liners, though, and as Le Chiffre remarks during one of the film's more unforgettable sequences, he has taken very good care of his body. <br />  <br />Eva Green is the Bond girl, and what an unusual Bond girl she is; attractive in a classy sort of way, wise, and just as intriguing as Bond himself.  Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is a despicable villain, with a damaged tear duct which frequently leaks blood.  He at first seems like the stereotypical over-the-top bad guy, but by the end of the film he becomes quite a menacing figure.  Giancarlo Giannini plays an amiable Rene Mathis, a character who featured prominently in a few of Fleming's books but makes his first screen appearance here, while Jeffrey Wright plays the first black Felix Leiter, Bond's best friend, who hasn't appeared in a Bond flick since 1987's THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.  I was never riveted by Judi Dench's M in the Brosnan films, but she truly shines in CASINO ROYALE. <br />  <br />Along with exemplary performances from the cast, there's a frankly epic screenplay by Paul Haggis with Neal Purvis & Robert Wade, who've written all the Bond films since THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH.  This script is very well-structured, and combines all the successful elements of previous Bond films while remaining down-to-earth; I'd imagine Haggis deserves most of the praise for this.  There's tender romance - yes, folks, real romance, not just your standard 007 sex scenes - laugh-out-loud comedy, and the most thoroughly riveting action sequences I've ever seen.  The script has little in common with the book on which it's based; however, if you've never read one of Fleming's Bond books and want to know what they're like, CASINO ROYALE is the closest thing we've ever seen to Ian Fleming's 007.  Some of the scenes and lines from that book are included, though, especially the infamous \\"torture scene\\", which - though considerably more tame in the film version - will still leave most men cringing as they exit the theater. <br />  <br />The first time I began to have faith in this film during its controversy-heavy production was when I learned that Martin Campbell was directing it.  Campbell also directed Pierce Brosnan's debut as 007, GOLDENEYE, an utterly superb entry in the series that revitalized the franchise in much the same way that CASINO ROYALE does.  CASINO ROYALE is the stylish, thrilling Bond adventure that I've been dreaming of for years, and that's due in very large part to Campbell's directing.  He likes to use close camera angles, which work well in adding that \\"human\\" aspect to the the frequently superhuman character of 007; it feels like we're in the action with Bond, and adds an element of intensity and unpredictability. <br />  <br />David Arnold's music is typically loud throughout most of the film.  I've always found the criticism of Arnold's Bond scores to be far too harsh; he mimicks the sound of John Barry's classic scores while adding a dash of his own style, and he does it well.  I'm not quite sure what to make of his music for CASINO ROYALE, though.  A large part of it is your stereotypical James Bond soundtrack - shrill, booming horns with the occasional techno line thrown in for good measure.  However, some of it - namely the love theme for James Bond and Vesper Lynd, Eva Green's character - is truly beautiful, and some of the finest music the series has ever had.  Audioslave's Chris Cornell contributes the film's theme, \\"You Know My Name\\".  The title's stupid, and the song's nearly as stupid; it's an odd alternative rock composition that just doesn't belong in the film.  It does work, however,in that it takes your mind off the absurd credits sequence. <br />  <br />There's as much in CASINO ROYALE to enrage Bond purists as there is to please them.  For one thing, the film does NOT open with the trademark gunbarrel; instead, a music-less gunbarrel pops up moments before the main title sequence.  To make matters worse, the legendary \\"James Bond Theme\\" doesn't pop up until the end credits - because, of course, in this film James Bond is not the suave agent we know and love until that point.  He doesn't say \\"Bond ... James Bond\\" until well into the film, and when questioned as to whether he wants his martini shaked or stirred, the irritated new Double-O shoots back, \\"Does it look like I give a damn?\\"  And, as if that's not bad enough, neither Q nor Moneypenny are even mentioned.  That's right - no gunbarrel, no \\"Bond ... James Bond\\", no theme song, no shaken-not-stirred martinis, no Q, and no Moneypenny.  But you know what?  I couldn't be happier.  That's all perfectly fitting for what's chronologically the first James Bond adventure, and I wouldn't have it any other way. <br /> <br />If you loved the intense realism of GOLDENEYE, if you loved the epic love story of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, if you loved the non-stop action of DIE ANOTHER DAY, if you loved the grit of LICENCE TO KILL, if you loved the suspense and thrills of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE - then this is the film you've been waiting for.  Not since FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE or perhaps the seemingly ultimate Bond picture, GOLDFINGER, has the series been so grounded in realism, and never before has a Bond film been so intelligent, so fun, and so compellingly-structured.  Daniel Craig is here to stay, and if the producers can come near matching the quality of CASINO ROYALE on BOND 22, then James Bond will continue to return for years to come. <br />

B000GFLAI0|3.0|There's no doubt that this album was going to have a hard time following on the heels of the wonderful Love and Theft, which marked one of the  high-points in Dylan's career (and that's saying something.)  Modern Times is very much Love and Theft's successor- the same nostalgic, rootsy Americana, except that this time, this is a far more muted collection.   <br /> <br />Whereas Love and Theft was bristling with lively performances, which ran the gamut from the swinging Summer Days to hard-edged blues-rockers like Lonesome Day Blues and Cry A While, Modern Times rarely, if ever, gets the pulse going.  Its a very sedate collection- the opener Thunder on the Mountain, along with Rollin and Tumblin, and the boogie of the Levee's Gonna Break, are the only tracks that try to lift the tempo, and even then, the gentle production smooths the edges and lessens their impact.  Indeed, for all the talk of the crack musicians who played on this album, it is musically a little disappointing.  The playing has been deemed highly subtle- well, its obviously too subtle for me, because my intial impression was that it sounded quite drab and colourless next to the effervescence of its predecessor.  Whether this is to do with the production, which softens the edges of the instruments a little, or whether it is because the songs simply aren't that memorable, I'm not sure.  Perhaps its also down to the lack of surprise on offer here.  Whereas Love and Theft's joyous embrace of jazz and waltz stylings sounded fresh after the dirge-blues of Time Out of Mind, Modern Times offers us simply more of the same, albeit not quite as good. <br /> <br />However, as I write this, Modern Times is starting to grow on me- its a consistent collection all right, and there are certainly no bad tracks as such.  And of course, Dylan's wonderful, gravelly voice, tinged with wry humour (\\"I tried to get ya to love me/but I wont repeat that mistake\\" he growls at one point) will gradually endear the songs to the listener.  Nevertheless, Dylan is undoubtedly a victim of his own high standards, but I feel sure that were it not for the ever-growing myth surrounding the man, this enjoyably pleasant collection would have probably gone under the critical radar.     <br />

B000FVBLEI|5.0|This album has set the bar extremely high for the so called \\"metalcore\\" genre.  I really dont even consider this album to be metalcore.  More like melodic death metal, with some clean singing and some chugging breakdowns thrown in.  Now every other metalcore band has something to try and surpass.  Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, Unearth, Agayu, Bleeding Through, As I Lay Dying, Diecast and whoever else you can think of, cant even come close to touching this album at this point.  Forget those other bands, this is THE best the genre has to offer as of 2007.  <br /> <br />No other metalcore band can touch the heartfelt and amazingly thoughtout leads and solos of Oli Herbert (with help from Mike Martin).  This guy is one of the best guitarist we have in America.  Forget Trivium.  Forget all the other bull, his solos are actually masterpieces.  Not just mindless, lets stick 1000 notes in one solo, we think were cool cause we can play fast crap.  This stuff gets stuck in your head, its memorable.  You'll be humming it for weeks.  Not many other bands can do that to me.  (some that come to mind... In Flames and Arch Enemy) <br /> <br />I consider Oli Herbert to be one of the smartest guitar players we have in America right now, inside the melodic death genre.  Along with Jeff Loomis (Nevermore. I know they are not melodic death but if Dane growled then yea), James Malone (Arsis) and Peter Joseph + Patrick Pintavalle (The Absence).  All helping keep the melodic death metal scene respectable in the United States.  A place where it has been hurting for sometime now.  Buy this album if you really like guitar heavy music and amazing solos.

B000H5V8DG|4.0|Other reviewers have mentioned this, but it's worth repeating: THE PACKAGING FOR THIS SET IS ILL-CONCEIVED AND WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY DAMAGE EVERY DISC. Each season's discs are packaged in beautifully detailed cardboard sleeves that are constructed so that corners and edges meet where the bottom of the disc rests. This means that each disc brushes up against four pointed corners each time it moves in the sleeve. Almost all of my discs were scratched upon delivery, and my older DVD player would not read some of them because of the depth of the scratches (my newer player didn't have any trouble, fortunately). I'd ask for a replacement set, but it would arrive in the same condition because this is a design flaw, not a manufacturing error. I'm thinking about contacting Buena Vista or its manufacturer to complain. For the price of this set, the discs ought to be protected better. <br /> <br />Packaging flaws aside, this is an excellent collection. The Rambaldi box itself is a great piece of eye candy and has magnetic sides and top so it closes easily; it's almost a toy itself. The bottom compartment is lined with felt and holds a bonus disc exclusive to this set. You also get a small book detailing some of the series' secrets, which is a nice bonus but not beefy enough to be a selling point. <br /> <br />I won't critique the content itself, other than to say that Alias is a shining example of dramatic television. It's one of my all-time favorite TV series and this collection contains every minute of every episode along with every bonus feature you could ask for.  <br /> <br />Concerning the show alone, this product would easily merit a five-star rating, but the packaging is a real bummer. I'm as big of an Alias fan as there is, but even I have to knock off a star for the scratched discs. I'd recommend to anyone who already has two or three of the season sets to just buy the remaining seasons separately. You won't have to rely on scratched discs that way.
B000JU7NCE|3.0|Well, I'm not one to normally complain about anything The Cure puts out but this DVD could have been much better. The song selection is overall very good, mixing songs from every studio release except for TIB and WMS, I believe. They play heavy on material from the era when Porl was previously in the band. As a four-piece, the songs that normally require keyboards are unique here with Porl filling in the keyboard parts on guitar and there has been no other \\"official\\" live releases for more than a few songs on this DVD such as \\"Shiver and Shake\\", \\"M\\", \\"The Baby Screams\\" or \\"Signal to Noise.\\" I can't complain about the sound quality, although the packaging did not indicate that that the 5.1 surround was DTS only and not Dolby. I prefer DD over DTS but the stereo surround mix was fine. The fact that the press release and the packaging do warn you that the video is essentially of the guerilla/audience/amateur quality still does not prepare you for the actual picture quality. My God, I just could not continue to watch the DVD. It hurt my eyes. Going for the  crappy camera/grainy out of focus quality angle was a poor choice. The cheesy blurring and double images nonense was worse than watching an old Black Sabbath video on VH1 Classic. I've got better quality (even today after multiple viewings) of a VHS recording of The Cure I made 15 years ago from a concert from Germany that MTV aired! This DVD is just plain unwatchable. I will simply turn off the video and listen to the audio. This only makes the absolute need for re-releasing \\"In Orange\\" and \\"Show\\" onto DVD sooner rather than later. Too bad. This could have been a much better release for Cure fans.
B00012QM9K|5.0|The genius that is Spielberg at his best. So many moving scenes, especially the children seeking shelter from the Nazis. What really stands out in my mind, is the little girl wearing the red coat in an all black-and-white film. Her fate is followed to the end. A very sad end. Nothing from Spieleberg, or any other director had ever been portrayed with such powerful effect. No other film even comes close to the horrors portrayed with such realism. Liam Neeson seems ten feet tall in the role of Oskar Schindler. How freely man is willing to unload his deadly weapons upon a fellow human being, when blinded by prejudice. And the real truth, is that nothing can even begin to tell the horrors that really went on.
B000002P5W|5.0|Hendrix recorded three of the greatest rock albums ever released: why argue about which is best? They're so different as to be incommensurate. My favorite is whichever one I'm listening to at the moment.<br /><br />But this is a review of Axis, so here's my $0.02:<br /><br />Castles Made of Sand:<br /><br />The guitar solo here has an amazing story: it's very melodic, unlike most \\"backwards guitar\\" solos (i.e., it sounds, melodically, as though it was played \\"forwards\\"), but the envelope (the way the notes start and stop) is reversed -- normally, a note starts suddenly (when the string is plucked) and then fades, but here the notes come up gradually and then stop suddenly, like the end has been clipped off (think \\"Are You Experienced\\"). I've always wondered how he pulled that off.<br /><br />According to my son, a guitarist and electronics aficionado, the process was:<br /><br />1. record the solo<br /><br />2. play that tape in reverse and LEARN TO PLAY THE SOLO BACKWARDS!<br /><br />3. record this backwards version of the solo<br /><br />4. play THAT tape in reverse for the final take<br /><br />This would give you a \\"forwards\\" melody with a \\"backwards\\" envelope. Only Hendrix could have thought of this and pulled it off.<br /><br />Axis Bold As Love (title track):<br /><br />I'm surprised that nobody (well, at least in the couple of dozen most-recent reviews I scanned) said anything about the gorgeous, transcendent solo at the end of the title track.<br /><br />It's easy to blow people away if you play with blinding speed, but to do it with a langorous, fluid melody like the one in the first half of this solo... it's pretty rare. And the second half, after the flanged drum riff -- well, I can't imagine anyone's pulse *not* accelerating as the tempo edges faster and faster and the guitar soars into the stratosphere.<br /><br />IMO, if Hendrix had recorded only one song, and that song was \\"Axis Bold As Love,\\" he'd still be in the pantheon of guitar gods.<br /><br />Trivia note: If you were wondering who sang about a \\"freak flag\\" first -- Hendrix or CSN&Y -- the answer is (of course) Hendrix: \\"If 6 was 9\\" was recorded in 1967, and \\"Almost Cut My Hair\\" not until 1970.
B000000WGL|5.0|What a unique album this is.  Imagine a mix of solid old-school rock and roll, old-fashioned African-American funk (horns, backup singers, freaky bass lines), and even a little cajun on a few numbers, and you can kind of get an idea of what this album is all about.  It's great fun to listen to from beginning to end.  Keith Richards' voice is not the greatest, but he packs so much emotion and nuance into his singing that it more than makes up for it.  Richards has always quested for the roots of rock and roll, and he continues to resurrect and refine ideas that created the genre--mixing jazz, rock, funk, and folk to create his own sounds.  Encore!
B000JJRIN4|5.0|i think the cd is great i love how original and creative it is the best tracks are of corse wind it up, breaking up, u started it and wonderful life also lonely winter check it out!!
B00003CXTG|4.0|Though the story line may lag a bit, Michael Bay has the director's eye for realism. It looks and feels like the 40s. Some of the best war film effects ever. I found the attack and subsequent battle scenes to be spectacular. Outstanding cinematography and sound, you can't beat it for viewing on your Home Theater system. Not the best plot, though I've seen much worse, still visually stunning. The first purchase in my DVD collection.
0380820846|3.0|After reading The Duke and I, I had high hopes for this book. I thought it would be a great story after I read the introduction. However, the main characters lack chemistry and I just wasn't excited about them. It was just dull. It's still a decent book, however,not a keeper.
B00092QUQC|5.0|WOW! That's the only way to describe the latest offering from Gotthard.If you are in to the melodic rock scene,you can do no better than these guys. I just can't believe that I had never heard them until recently. After hearing this,I have since picked up their Debut,1 life 1 soul,Human zoo,and a couple of others and have yet to be disappointed. If you like TNT,Icon,House of Lords,Whitesnake,or any bands of that Genre,then this is the band for you.If you only purchase 1 cd this year(doubtful,I know),get this one.It's that good!
1400079179|4.0|Certainly one of the most popular novels in recent memory, even before the movie came out, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has been widely hailed as a modern masterpiece, but also lambasted as a heretical treatise on Jesus Christ's life.  Dan Brown provides the ultimate conspiracy theory, one that has spanned 2000 years and involves the Catholic Church in a massive cover-up complete with thousands of ruthless murders.  Perhaps the fact that his novel has generated such an outrage from some Christian writers, should be a compliment.  His work, of course, is FICTION, yet he paints such a masterful scenario of this conspiracy at so many levels, that it certainly seems as if it could be true.  For the record, Dan Brown is a Christian and \\"welcomes\\" the debate his novel brings, even though his theories and interpretations certainly cannot be proven.<br /><br />Equally as intriguing as the \\"true\\" story of Jesus and Mary Magdalene is the concept of hidden messages in art.  Da Vinci's artwork, rumored to contain hidden messages, is explored and interpreted to yield a whole new world of hidden contexts and secrets.  Although the veracity of Brown's claims are debatable, the way the story is presented would cause many readers to re-examine a famous artwork.  I know that I examined the \\"Last Supper\\" and \\"Madonna of the Rocks\\" in detail after reading his interpretations.<br /><br />Certainly, the Catholic church is treated in a harsh light, specifically the ultra-conservatives, characterized by Opus Dei.  The Vatican and their conspiracy machine and cohorts, as well as past horrors of \\"Christian\\" purges, are dealt in a harsh manner.  Ultimately, though, the church is shown in a positive light toward the end.  Throughout the novel, though, religious people are treated in a mostly neutral light.  However, those who are treated most harshly are the \\"Grail\\" hunters, those who dedicate their entire lives to chasing a fantasy, characterized by Leigh Teabing.<br /><br />Although \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is written for the mass audiences and will probably never be on any high school literature list, it is a fun and easy book to enjoy, with unexpected twists and turns and masterful suspense.  If you're looking for serious literature, go elsewhere, but otherwise this is an enjoyable book, regardless of religion persuasion.inci Code\\" is written for the mass audiences and will probably never be on any high school literature list, it is a fun and easy book to enjoy, with unexpected twists and turns and masterful suspense.

0440238609|4.0|I recently finished reading these three books at the suggestion of a good friend; and I must say that I was utterly captivated by the world(s) Pullman painted so eloquently. From the moment I opened the first book, to the moment I closed the last; I was completely ensconced. Prior to reading these books I read a few reviews, and a good number of them seemed to be laden with allusions to the Harry Potter series (which I also enjoy). I was half expecting this series to be somewhat of a Harry Potter clone. I soon found out that these three books were much more astute in their complexity. Right away you realize that these three books were written with much more depth and intellect (from the ideas it expresses, to the many characters involved). You'll kick yourself for having pegged it as a Harry Potter clone, such as I did.  <br /> <br />If you're contemplating picking these books up, do yourself a favor and rid you mind of all the Harry Potter comparisons before you do. Because in my opinion, there is no comparison. These THREE books smite the FIVE Harry Potter books down, with all the strength and ferocity of an Armored Bear.

B00000J2PH|5.0|This music still sounds as fresh today as when I first heard it in 1971; every song on the album is as great as the last.  And the 2 bonus tracks are a special treat!  Carole King is truely an extrordiarily talented composer and preformer. <br /> <br />I feel the audio quality of this remastered CD probably extracts just about everything that is there on the master tapes.  Included in the liner notes is a picture of the master tape boxes, probably an effort to reinforce the feeling that you're hearing this album exactly as it was meant to be heard with this CD.  The overall sound is well balanced and generally pleasing.  Technically, the sound quality is average to above average for the early 1970s, not poor but not outstanding. <br /> <br />But musically, this album is one of the best, if not the best, singer/songwriter albums ever recorded.  A piece of history that belongs in every music lover's collection...
B000002GY9|5.0|It would be tough to choose Tom Waits' best album, but this one would have to be in the running.  \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\" alone is worth price of entry.  I wonder if Shane MacGowan (of the Pogues) heard that song at a young age?
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I remember going to an Alice in Wonderland exhibition as a kid, and there were all these large scale prints of the illustrations from the original Alice in Wonderland novel. I remember feeling a bit disappointed at how dry and colourless they looked, being a really big fan of the Disney animated film at the time. If I'm honest about it, this animation is probably somewhere in my top 25 favorite movies. <br /> <br />The film's loosely based on Lewis Carrol's book \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" with a twist of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" and a sprinkling of unique but just as curious characters (like the Doorknob, the bircage bird and the dog with a broom for a head). There's lots I like about this film: the rich colours, the motion, the look of the characters, the wordplays and quotable lines, Kathryn Beaumont's Alice voice, all sorts of things. The music is probably my favorite in a Disney film as well. Quite a few classic tunes, I reckon, some silly, some pretty, all fun to listen to. Some of my favorite songs are \\"I'm Late, I'm Late!\\", \\"How Do You Do And Shake Hands\\", \\"Walrus and the Carpenter\\", \\"A Very Happy Unbirthday\\", \\"Painting the Roses Red\\", but I like them all really. <br /> <br />I reckon it's really worth a look for fans of Disney and of Alice in Wonderland. It's a unique one, and it'll always be my favorite film interpretation of the book, I think.
B000BB14YY|5.0|It is the story in the Warring State Period in Japan. One day, Hidetora, who is the lord in a province and has three castles, talked his children to give them his patrimony suddenly. He also told his children the story that three arrows because he hopes they support each other to govern to flourish the province. However, his third son, Saburo, opposed that, He thought some conflict would happened between children to monopolize their patrimony if father gave them his patrimony. Although Saburo opposed Hidetora's suggestion, he did not listen to him, and he was angry. Therefore, Saburo was forsaken  by Hidetora. One of guests, Fujimaki, who saw the quarrel between Hidetora and Saburo, favored Saburo. Then he invited his castle as his son - in - law. While Saburo is invited by Fujimaki, other two children plot to start fighting. Though, their father, Hidetora lived in the first castle which was given Ichiro, he was treated badly from both of his children. Moreover, he was attacked by them, it means he was betrayed from his children. Finally, he understand Saburo was right, but it is too late. He became crazy when two of his follower found him. The follower left one person and went to Fujimaki's Castle to call Saburo. Saburo went to seek his father with many soldiers. Jiro who is second son of Hidetora heard Saburo is coming to get Hidetora and afraid of Saburo's invading. Jiro followed his army to prepare the war. Then, he tried to kill Saburo when he went to seek Hidetora. However, Saburo was really smart because he makes hide his soldiers who have guns. Jiro was trapped  Saburo's strategy and he finally lost the war. Then, Saburo found Hidetora and he went back with his father. However, the last tragedy happened. Saburo was shot by someone, and died when he went back  his castle. And then, Hidetora also died after Saburo died.  <br />     The movie is described about the relationship between human very well. The struggle of parent's inherits also happen today. It is not only showing old time era but also today's inherit problems. Inheritance makes change relationships between people even they were very close before.  The movie was drawn the look of that father became an insane very well. Although I have never watched Akira Kurosawa's movie, I felt his skill of an expression of people's feeling is awesome! i have never seen such a good movie of period play. I understand why he is a famous around the world watching through his movie, Ran.  <br />
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie makes you truly appreciate finding your true love at the right place and time. The film follows Alex and Kate as they fall in love and try to figure out how to be together when they have to deal with being in different time periods. I loved the acting of both Reeves and Bullock. I thought they were good in Speed, but they were better in The Lake House. Rent/Buy it and prepare to hold your girl tight.
B000274THQ|5.0|A wonderful view of East Germany, both before and after the wall.  The special features were amazing, showing the design of the levitating Lenin and the fabricated 'dirty' Germany.
B000FGGE68|1.0|The TV previews were the best parts of the movie.  Other than that, it was a total waste of time to watch.  The story was completely off the wall stupid.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  I have only seen it once and I don't plan to watch it ever again.

B000FTWB7G|3.0|I became a big fan of Evanescence four years ago when \\"Fallen\\" broke out in the mainstream. I loved the combination of Amy Lee's vocals and the meaty guitar riffs and thunderous rhythm section. After the loss of Ben Moody, the health of the band's guitarist, and a lawsuit or two here and there, the band finally re-emerges from its 2-3 yearslumber with \\"The Open Door\\". I had been eagerly anticipating the band's new album \\"The Open Door\\", maybe not so much lately since my taste in music over the years become much darker than Evanescence's music (gimme Blutengel and Cinderella Effect over Evanescence any day). Now that I finally have \\"The Open Door\\", I have to admit that I was disappointed in what I heard. The more I have listened to \\"The Open Door\\", the less impressed I am with the album. I find most of the songs devoid of melody. The guitar riffs are nothing to write home about. They are your standard rock riffs that you hear in most, if not all mainstream rock bands. The songs sounded all too much alike. I couldn'tell one song from the other with my eyes closed. I also find the lyrics contrived. Amy Lee comes off sounding whiney on all of the songs. She needs to get over herself big time. There were not many gems to be heard on the album. while it lacks the emotional impact of the ballads off \\"Fallen\\" like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\", \\"Lithium\\" is a pretty decent ballad but it would have sounded better as a simple piano ballad. The over dramatic melodies were nothing more but over dramatic. I also liked the first single of the album \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\". Maybe it is my constantly evolving taste in music but whatever the case may be, \\"The Open Door\\" was a lackluster follow up to \\"Fallen\\" to me, Lacuna Coil put out a vastly superior album earlier this year. The band knows how to diversify their gothic metal sound without alienating their hardcore fans. Evanescence might want to take their cue from Lacuna Coil, Leaves' Eyes, and most gothic metal bands who does this sort of music 100 times better. If \\"The Open Door\\" is what to expect from Evanescence in the future, thanks but no thanks.is sort of music 100 times better. If \\"The Open Door\\" is what to expect from Evanescence in the future, thanks but no thanks.
B000006SBY|4.0|Bryan Adams' self-titled debut album, \\"Bryan Adams\\" is probably the one album of the Bryan Adams portfolio that is forgotten.   This was an effort released back in 1980 and recorded when Adams was 20 years old.   While it would be Adams' sophomore effort, \\"You Want It, You Got It\\" that would be the album that helped him build a name for himself, \\"Bryan Adams\\" still shows the promise for what is to be solid career.  There are some very good songs on this collection that may appeal to someone who is looking to go deeper within the Adams portfolio. <br /> <br />There have been two staples of Bryan Adams' career:  His songwriting partnerships and his top-notch band.   As for the songwriting partnerships, Adams has partnerships with Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange and Gretchen Peters, but perhaps the best known is Adams' partnership with Jim Vallance.   It is on \\"Bryan Adams\\" that the songwriting partnership with Jim Vallance would begin.  This partnership would last for five full albums and part of a sixth (the songwriting alliance came to an end on \\"Waking Up the Neighbours\\").   During this time, much of the material would be a balance of hard-rocking songs and power ballads that often revolved around the theme of relationships (although later albums such as \\"Into the Fire\\" would explore more social issues).   On \\"Bryan Adams\\", we see the roots of this alliance and how they revolve around the theme of relationships.  This album also presents a lot of unique sounds that many may not have seen in Bryan Adams in his more popular works. <br /> <br />As for Adams' bands, he has always had a staple for having a top-notch band.  Starting with \\"You Want It, You Got It\\", Adams' would begin to assemble his band - drummer Mickey Curry and keyboardist Tommy Mandel were brought in.   One Adams' third album, \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\", Adams' recruited guitarist Keith Scott and bassist Dave Taylor.  These four members would become longtime staples of Adams' band - especially Scott and Curry (two of the best studio musicians in the business) who for all practical purposes stay with Adams throughout his whole musical tenure.  These musicians have played a key role in shaping \\"the Adams sound\\".   To some extent, \\"Bryan Adams\\" isn't helped because it lacks these musicians supplementing Adams' terrific vocals and lyrics.  I wouldn't categorize this as a negative, because the sound on this album is still very strong.   It is just that the sound could have been even better if Adams had his regular band assembled for this collection.   On the other hand, \\"Bryan Adams\\" might be the closest thing to a true solo album in the Adams portfolio.   For the most part, Adams and Vallance handle the lion's share of the instrumentals on this collection. <br /> <br />Here is a look at each of the tracks on the collection: <br /> <br />\\"Hiding From Love\\": This song has some nice guitar riffs but for the most part has more of a synthesizer feel.   From a lyrical standpoint, this song has the classic Adams/Vallance feel when it comes to relationships.   This is a song that is catchy and one of the better tracks on the collection. <br /> <br />\\"Win Some, Lose Some\\":  This song has much more of a Rock feel to it.   Both the music and Adams' vocals are raw, but that seems to work on this track.   There is some interesting keyboards and percussions in this song that help make the song stand out.   <br /> <br />\\"Wait and See\\":  This song has a classic Adams feel to it and should keep Adams fans happy.  Vallance provides some terrific guitar work - particularly at the end.   The ending kind of reminds me of \\"She's Only Happy When She's Dancing\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Give Me Your Love\\": This song shows the softer-side to Adams as he sings a ballad.   Adams' voice isn't quite as polished as it his on his latter ballads, but this song still shows much potential.  The melody of this song has a slight R&B feel - something that really isn't seen on later Adams' albums. <br /> <br />\\"Wastin Time\\":  Onceagain, we see a song that is reminiscent of what is the classic Adams/Vallance feel when it comes to relationships.   A very solid track. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Ya Say It\\": To the Adams fan, this is going to be one of the most unique songs in Adams' career. This song has a Motown feel up and down.  Adams pulls this sound off perfectly. There is a terrific saxophone solo and some great background vocals that really put a stamp on this song.   It is a shame that Adams hasn't done more like this. <br /> <br />\\"Remember\\": This might be the best-known track from this album as Adams has been known to do this song in some of his more recent concerts (a live version is on the \\"Live at the Budokan\\" concert).  This is a very strong track.   This is another example of synthesizers and solid guitar riffs gelling very nicely.  The beat is very catchy as well. <br /> <br />\\"State of Mind\\": This song reminds me of Bryan Adams meets Billy Joel.  The piano work and lyrics does loosely resemble something by Billy Joel.  It is Adams' raspy vocals that put his own signature on this song.  There is a good guitar solo on this song as well. <br /> <br />\\"Try to See it My Way\\": Another song that has a classic Adams/Vallance feel, but at the same time this is the kind of song you feel like you can blast the radio and cruise down the highway with.   Along with \\"Remember\\", this is the strongest track and it has a great feel for a \\"wrap-up\\" track for an album.  There is a good guitar bridge on this track. <br /> <br />The liner notes are thin and do not include the lyrics.   This is a very good album.  It should definitely appeal to the deep Adams fan, but it also offers something for the casual fan.   It sets the stage for a successful career to follow for  Bryan Adams.  Highly recommended.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing the band on the MTV Music Video Awards. I fell in love with CD very quickly. I love all of the songs. They're all fun to listen to. I especially like \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies,\\" \\"There's A Good Reason...\\" and \\"Lying Is The Most Fun...\\"  <br />I recently saw Panic! live and they were great! If they had a live CD, I'd buy that to. <br />Bottom line, I love this band and totally recommend them!
B000002H97|5.0|I think Metallica's self titled album is very very good as was their last of their classics and was best after great albums like And Justice For All that rocked hard. The song Enter Sandman in my opinion has to be one of the finest songs ever created by them as well as The Unforgiven. My Friend of Misery,Wherever I May Roam,and Dont Tread On Me are other anthems. Highly recommended.
0312997221|4.0|Rather than the \\"normal\\" thriller plot, Forsyth reveals an event early, and then the rest of the book leads up to that event.<br /><br /> While I agree with other reviewers that this is not \\"Jackal\\", the protaganist is a very methodical hero who is quite interesting.<br /><br />If you like \\"cat and Mouse\\" suspense novels, this is a book for you.  All the events are credible, and the contemporary setting of the Bosnian war is very interesting.
0618680004|2.0|\\"I do not, by nature, thrive on confrontation.\\" Well, that's Dawkins' contention as he opens chapter 8 at least. Later on in the same section of the book, the author claims that the phrase \\"American Taliban\\" was begging to be coined. Begged by whom? The frothing at the mouth reactionaries who toss schoolyard insults at those they do not agree with?<br />Peter Singer, high priest of the deeply lunatic fringe of the animal liberation movement who argues amongst other perverse ideas that zoophilia is not unethical if there is no harm or cruelty to the animal, is claimed by Dawkins to be '...the most eloquent advocate of the view that we should move to a post-speciesist condition in which humane treatment is meted out to all species that have the brain power to appreciate it.' It would be interesting to engage this ethic with the good professor using a hypothetical plague epidemic carried by rats.<br />Pondering the issue of abortion, the author compares the suffering of a cow in a slaughterhouse to a developing human fetus that has been terminated. Apparently the value human life is comparative to cattle.  When they took Bessie to market they may very well have killed the next Marie Curie?<br />I share Richard Dawkins' atheism as devotedly as he no doubt does, but I cannot countenance his moral equivalency. I am far more afraid of Islamofascism (which to his credit he attacks but does not call by its correct title) than American Christians who wish to take Harry Potter out of the library.<br />My values are humanist, but I am an unabashed 'speciesist.' The philosophical world, the sciences, and the 'Zeitgeist' that indicates we are capable of becoming more compassionate, kind and humane, come from the human condition not from the activities of say a herd of reindeer.<br />Not Dawkins' best work by a long shot, this book is a haphazard invective of muddy moral musings and unbalanced argument against religious faith.

B000G8NXYG|4.0|I had never seen this movie until i bought it. I couldn't find a local rental place that carried it and I really wanted to see it. The film was excellent, and so was the total package. The quality of the digital transfer and the new 5.1 soundtrack were remarkable. However for a $45 dvd I was very bummed there wasn't an English audio track. It can be argued that one should only watch a classic like this in the original Japanese, however an English audio track would have made this movie much more accessible.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|LAMB devotees may be turned off a bit by this new album; it is quite different than her first. On her first album, she went all out for a retor 80s/New Wave type of sound with a little Hip Hop thrown in, and accomplished it with aplomb on tracks like \\"What You Waiting For?,\\" \\"Hollaback Girl,\\" and \\"Cool.\\" For her second album. Gwen went for more of a modern/futuristic feel. Hip Hop fans will prefer \\"Wind It Up,\\" \\"Orange County Girl,\\" Yummy,\\" \\"Breakin' Up,\\" and \\"U Started It,\\" all produced by the Neptunes, and Swizz Beatz's \\"Now That You Got It.\\" Fans of dance pop and New Wave will prefer Tony Kanal's \\"4 in the Morning, \\"Flourescent,\\" and \\"Don't Get It Twisted,\\" as well as Nellee Hooper's \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\" and, surprisingly, the Akon-produced \\"Sweet Escape\\". Stand-out tracks include \\"Now That You Got It,\\" the delicious \\"Yummy,\\" \\"Don't Get it Twisted,\\" and ode to \\"that time of the month,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Wonderful Life,\\" which has a sad subject, but excellant lyrics, melody and a hard-hitting dance track. The only bad song on the album is \\"Breakin' Up,\\" which hardly counts as music and is completely unlistenable, IMO. It also doesn't fin in with the album, which is usually forgivable if the song is good. This one is not.  <br /> <br />1. Wind it Up - 3/5 <br />2. Sweet Escape - 3.5/5 <br />3. Orange County Girl - 3/5 <br />4. Early Winter - 3.5/5 <br />5. Now That You Got It - 4/5 <br />6. 4 in the Morning - 3.5/5 <br />7. Yummy - 4.5/5 <br />8. Flourescent - 2.5/5 <br />9. Breakin' Up - 1/5 <br />10. Don't Get it Twisted - 4/5 <br />11. You Started It - 3/5 <br />12. Wonderful Life - 5/5
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Huey Lewis & The News is a great band.  The music is just upbeat and fun.  I graduated high school in 1985 and I remember all through the 80s liking these guys whenever I heard them.  These guys are just plain cool - clean cut, upbeat, fun, good-looking, and their music is excellent.  I just love their style of music and Huey's voice is great.  Their later stuff is fine too, but I'm mostly familiar with their 1980s stuff as I was a young adult then.  I can't really think of another band with quite the same sound as these guys and they are just great. <br /> <br />I recommend this CD because it is very positive, fun, and upbeat music to listen to.  What's not to like?

Not being familiar with her work, I took a chance buying this CD on the basis of some reviews, and wasn't sorry that I did.   <br /> <br />Whenever I want to listen to an artist that holds my attention but doesn't shout to gain it, I would \\"Put Your Records On\\" and sit back and enjoy Corrine Bailey Rae!

I was 14 when they came to America for the Ed Sullivan show and I have loved them ever since. I finally got to see Paul in concert last yearand was so thankful to at least have seen one of them in person and now this CD helps me to relive all those wonderful memories when my life was a lot simpler. My grown sons also love the Beatles so I plan to get them each a copy.  Just enjoy the music - I'm sure if they were all alive they would love it.
0670038040|5.0|Horace Rumpole is mad as heck and he's not going to take it anymore!   <br /> <br />John Mortimer's latest offering in his Rumpole of the Bailey series, \\"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror\\", finds Rumpole at his grouchy best.  His grouchiness is not directed at his usual targets: Hilda (She Who Must be Obeyed) Rumpole or his colleagues at his law chambers. Instead, Rumpole has targeted his verbal slings and arrows at anti-terror legislation passed by Parliament in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and the terror bombings in London of 7 July, 2005.  Rumpole (and presumably Mortimer) believes that elements of these Acts threaten to destroy some of the civil liberties Britons have fought for since Magna Carta.  Specifically, and despite his loathing for the bus-bombing terrorists, Rumpole is apoplectic at elements of the legislation that allows Britain's police and security forces to detain suspected (non-citizen) terrorists for an indefinite period without benefit of counsel or a formal presentation of charges. In other words Rumpole see a threat to two legal precepts he holds dearest:  the right of any suspect to seek relief from possibly unlawful detention via the use of the \\"great writ of habeas corpus\\"; and the presumption that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. <br /> <br />Rumpole falls into his latest case, in this case something akin to a legal crusade, by accident.  He is defending one of the Timson clan (the crime family that has provided Rumpole with a reasonable income (a claim disputed by Hilda no doubt) for his entire career on a run of the mill breaking and entering charge.  One of the Timson `girls' seeks Rumpole's assistance. Her husband, a Pakistani-born doctor, has been arrested and detained on unspecified terrorism charges.  The wife is convinced that her husband is innocent and Rumpole takes the case.  To Rumpole's chagrin the Timson clan fires Rumpole because they are patriots and refuse to do business with anyone who helps terrorists.  Rumpole is stymied at every turn trying to get a trial for his client in order to determine his guilt or innocence until he finds a bit of information about one of his protagonists that he uses to great, if not ethical advantage.  To add to Rumpole's woes, She Who Must Be Obeyed is busy locked up in a room typing her memoirs. <br /> <br />The above description of the plot may make Rumpole and The Reign of Terror sound a bit more depressing and less funny than the typical Rumpole story.  Fortunately, this is not the case.  Despite the fact that Mortimer has taken on a serious subject, Rumpole, Hilda and the usual suspects retain their usual eccentricities.  Mortimer writes with a light touch, even on a subject as serious as terrorism and manages to pull it off even as Rumpole sputters on in a caustic fashion about Tony Blair and his `new Labour' minions.  Rumpole remains a delightfully drawn character. Further, Mortimer provides excerpts from Hilda's memoir-in-progress and they serve as a  humorous Greek chorus that sets out popular sentiment that runs contrary to Rumpole's ideals. <br /> <br />I very much enjoyed Rumpole and the Reign of Terror.  I understand that many readers, even Rumpole fans, will not share Rumpole's view of the sanctity of `the law' in a time of terror.  However, Mortimer's writing is first-rate and funny as always and I don't think a divergent viewpoint should keep a potential reader away from another wonderful story of the trials and tribulations of the great Rumpole of the Bailey!  Enjoy.  L. Fleisig <br />
B000JJRIN4|3.0|First off, I do like this album, but because I expect more of Gwen Stefani, I'm not going to rate it higher, though I'd go to 3-1/2 stars if it were an option. Love.Angel.Music.Baby. was a great debut, and a lot more fun to dance to. The songs there stood out more on their own, from the awesome 'Hollaback Girl' to the fun and bubbly kitsch of 'Harajuku Girls' and 'What You Waiting For?' -- at least those were the ones that really grabbed hold of me.   Not every song was the greatest on that album, but to me it had more high points. But this one is good, too. 'Wind It Up' is a lot of fun, and you gotta give her credit for using stuff from Sound of Music. But her raps are kind of silly and juvenile (just like Fergie's Fergalicious'). Yet there are a couple of nice ballads here, 'Wonderful Life' and 'Early Winter' sound lovely, and 'Yummy' is fun (but not a ballad), but it reminds me a lot of Kelis' \\"Milkshake,\\" right down to the little bell ringing (\\"my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard\\" (ting)). Gwen's isn't far off from that, but Kelis' single had more complexity, better drums and rhythm and she had the right attitude for the song.   'Now That You Got It' is fun, bouncy catchy stuff, too, so there are some high points. Problem is that some of this album, OK, a lot of  it, feels like she's running with a deadline and is trying to capitalize on the success of 'L.A.M.B.\\" mainly by releasing something quickly on what already has proven to be a really busy year (with the baby and all).   Some stuff has a great 1980s synth vibe, and some songs, especially the stuff on the second half, made me think a lot about Depeche Mode -- almost like she'd gotten a time machine and brought the boys back from 1982 to help produce and write parts of this album). I think with more listens it'll grow on me even more, as a fun dance album.
B000001E8P|5.0|Ten years later, \\"Different Class\\" remains one of the best albums of all time. I have heard the songs hundreds of times and never get tired. There are six standout tracks: Common People, Disco 2000, Something Changed, Feeling Called Love, Underwear & Monday Morning.  <br /> <br />I recently requested \\"Common People\\" at a club...and it remains an anthem of angst, brit pop, glam rock and a brillant screw-the-world perspective.  <br /> <br />Alas, Pulp's follow-up albums were not able to come close to \\"Different Class\\". So disappointing. But it's not called a Magnum Opus for nothing. I hope frontman Jarvis Cocker's new solo album will provide some solace.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|'Sweet Escape' may not grab you on your first listen, but give it a chance.  It totally grows on you.  Gwen has evolved and so should her fans.  LAMB was so different from her No Doubt sound that it took some getting used to (am I the only one who thought 'Hollaback Girl' was weird the first time I heard it and then grew to LOVE it?).  I am not sure why people claim they are 'disappointed' with this album.  I think that people have too many expectations and need to be more open minded. True fans should respect that she is an artist and she is trying out new sounds and not putting out some lame-fluffy-pop album.  I read an interview where she says that she really loves this album and that is what is most important to her.  I admire that much more than someone making an album of music they think other people want to hear.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The only downside to \\"American Idiot\\" is that anything Green Day comes out with after, will be inferior. This album - from start to finish - is the \\"Tommy\\" (The WHO's classic album) of our times. It is brilliant, angry, aggressive, funny, thought-provoking, political, crazy and amazing. It is an example of the very best that modern music has to offer - which, albeit, is not saying much nowadays. I have rarely been as blown away by an album as I was listening to this. For some bizarre reason, I missed the whole Green Day wave of the 90s...American Idiot was my first Green Day album...bought a year AFTER it was first released. But I have made up for lost time. The flipside of the American Idiot single \\"Too Much Too Soon\\" is a great (missing) 14th track...that helps tie the album together in a nice bow. No need to describe each song, they are all stellar. And will be for a long time. I am worried, though, about the next Green Day album. Magnum Opus' always have a way of disappointing fans because they are so good, invariably the subsequent product pales in comparison.
0446528056|5.0|Nicholas Sparks's latest novel, DEAR JOHN, currently is atop the New York Times bestseller list, and for good reason. Sparks writes human emotion with empathy and deals with life-changing subjects that corral the reader's interest. Love between unlikely couples is the magnet that ignites one to read on. <br /> <br />John Tyree is a product of Wilmington, North Carolina, a port city between Myrtle Beach and Charleston. Iced with pretentious summer vacation homes, the beaches invite visitors and homegrown youth to the finest in water sport. John had enlisted in the army after high school, not knowing exactly what he wanted to do with his life. Now on leave from his Army tour in Germany, he enjoys the return to surfing along the beach. It is here that he retrieves a young lady's bag that has dropped into the deep waters, an incident that changes his life forever. <br /> <br />Savannah Lynn Curtis, a college student on a summer mission for Habitat for Humanity, is staying in one of the rental vacation mansions with her work group. She and John both grew up in country locations, though their family backgrounds are radically different. Savannah's world is energetic and socially broad, but she approaches John's quiet and remote relationship with his father with genuine intent and insists that they meet. <br /> <br />Wary of the outcome, John succumbs. He engages in little real conversation with his father, who is obsessed with coin collecting and seems unable to talk about much else. Savannah reacts to the situation by offering John a book on autism that she thinks will help him better understand his father's behavior. John is hurt by the interference, and feels that Savannah is intruding. He brushes her thoughts aside and instead enjoys their time together realizing how much she is filling in his life. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, John's leave ends and his return to Germany puts their friendship on hold. <br /> <br />\\"Dear John, Should I start by telling you that I love you...If you come back, I'll marry you ...Love, Savannah.\\" <br /> <br />John reads these words on his plane ride to Germany and can think of nothing but going back to North Carolina. He is given that chance when he returns home on leave in 2001. Their days together are glorious, as John meets Savannah's family, spends time at her college with friends and engages in a whirlwind of social activity. Savannah vows to wait for John as he finishes his tour of duty, and John realizes that he is ready to settle down with his one true love. <br /> <br />But then the tragic events of September 11, 2001 unfold. Like a vise, that fateful day squeezes John's dreams for love and the future he was anticipating. Faced with an incredibly difficult choice, the stoic soldier returns to duty as he fights for his country. At the same time, he leaves Savannah with a tough decision as well: Should she wait for him, or move on? <br /> <br />Sparks leads John's squadron into Kosovo, Kuwait and eventually 100 miles into Iraq. But this is not a military saga; rather, it is a soldier's story set in wartime. A second Dear John letter from Savannah severs his hope for a future together. However, he seeks her out when he is home on leave following his father's death where many surprises await him.  <br /> <br />John's return from overseas --- drained by battles he's endured on professional and personal levels --- climaxes the narrative. Savannah's insight has opened John to possibilities outside himself; through her, he realizes the opportunity he's been given by his father. Sparks ends the book on an emotional positive. His message is that, though harsh and complex, love transforms us forever. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad
B00004T0UT|5.0|I first heard this album almost 20 years ago...I was in Grade Nine. I had bought the vinyl at a second hand record store - and dubbed it onto a cassette to listen to during a school trip. From the moment \\"Wearin' That Loved On Look\\" started, I knew this was not a typical Elvis album. It remains quite frankly the best Elvis album of all-time. The rich rawness of his voice, the vulnerability of his career at the time, the classic arrangements by Chips Moman, the brilliant Memphis sound - are clear with each track. I fell in love with this album and this era of his recording history. I even had a gold album specially made of this record to hang on my wall. Simply the best the King had to offer. Better than Sun, RCA, Hollywood and Vegas, \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" is not only my top choice, it deserves to be one of the greatest achievements of the American songbook.
0385505833|4.0|During this crazy season, there are times when I wish we can just skip Christmas and avoid the holiday hassles of shopping, wrapping presents, baking and family wrestling over who gets to have Christmas at their place. And if you're in a foul mood because of all those reasons listed above or more ... do yourself a favor and pick this one up.<br /><br />I am not a huge Grisham fan, but this book fits the mood perfectly. Luther Krank just saw his daughter off to South America where she is working for the Peace Corps. After tallying how much he spends on just \\"Christmas stuff\\" ~~ he decided to take that money and treat his wife (and himself) to a cruise. Just think of it ~~ no hassles, no cards to fret over, no big dinner and above all, they will be celebrating Christmas someplace warm and getting a tan. After convincing Nora, his wife, to go along with his plan ~~ things start to go awry. His neighbors are affronted that he didn't put up his Frosty the Snowman up on the rooftop; the stationary supply office was upset that they didn't order their usual $350 assortments of cards; Luther's colleagues thought he was strange for denying even the parties ... and so on. Then his daughter announces that she's coming home for Christmas ... what was Luther to do?<br /><br />It is hilarious. It's perfect for those rare moments you find yourself sitting in front of the tree, listening to a quiet house. If you do find a moment like this, please pick this book up. It's funny and while true to life, it does offer a reminder of why we all love Christmas.<br /><br />12-7-06
B0006GAOBI|5.0|After seeing the director's cut first and the original version of the movie second, I must say that the director's cut is a far better film. The director's cut has is subtle differences from the original, but they are enough to drive the movie into a different direction. In the original many of the themes are explained in a concluding monologue almost leaving the movie rather transparent. The directors cut is a far more rewarding experience than the original. The director's cut adds much more depth to the plot than in the original. The added depth breeds an even more confusing movie, however if the movie is watched closely (and you will want to watch this movie closely) everything is explained. The original doesn't show the pages of Sparrow's book which introduces the concepts of the \\"Manipulated Dead\\", the \\"Vessel\\" and many other elements. The original does contain a spoiler at the end that explains much of the movie. The monologue at the end was wisely removed for the directors cut and the pages of the book were shown. The director's cut also has additional scenes and parts of scenes that were removed from the original movie.     While the movie may have achieved a cult following, the soundtrack certainly hasn't. The soundtrack is littered with hidden gems that have started to find their way into the mainstream. Gary Jules' \\"Mad World\\" is simply brilliant, which was recently used in an Xbox commercial. In fact, the soundtrack to this movie contains all standout tracks. The soundtrack mirrors the movie extremely well, and really embodies the spirit of the movie.    The existentialist concepts are thought provoking, prompting my second viewing of the film. The website is just as confusing as the movie. If you haven't visited the movie's website, it's a giant game that gives background information on the movie and even offers an epilogue.     Overall it's an excellent movie. The directors cut makes the movie a little bit more confusing, but adds a tremendous amount of depth to the movie that wasn't in the original. However after watching the movie a second time, the true depth and concepts of the movie are revealed and my initial confusing gave way to awe. This is an excellent movie that has been overlooked for a long time. Even if you've seen the original, watch the director's cut, it adds the extra depth to the movie, transforming it from a great movie into a spectacular movie.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Incubus changes.  Long-time Incubus fans have come to expect a new sound from a new Incubus album.  Light Grenades is what it is; a new Incubus experience.  Depending on what draws you to Incubus, you may or may not enjoy this new album.  As with previous Incubus releases, there are sure to be a number of fans turned off by their ever-changing style; some listeners will inevitably prefer old Incubus to new Incubus.  On its own merits and not relative to past Incubus albums, Light Grenades is a very worthwhile album to listen to if you at all enjoy alternative rock & roll.
B000GFLAI0|1.0|This was a complete and utter disapointment.  Almost as bad as his self-serving autobiography--poor, poor Bob.  Unless he can come up with something different, he needs to just fade into the past when all of his best work was made.  This album sounds like retreads of some of his less inspiring cuts with little, if anything to say.
B00008977N|3.0|Prior reviews which criticize the transfer quality of this DVD are exactly correct.  It *is* terribly grainy.  The VHS version looks much better! <br /> <br />This is nothing against the show itself, which is excellent and a must-have for any Peter Gabriel fan.  In fact it's probably the best concert PG has done to date.  But video (and to a lesser extent, audio) quality are sorely lacking here.  If you don't need DVD-specific features buy the VHS instead.
0451169514|2.0|I have read three of his books, this, Insomnia and the Talisman, I don't know if its bad luck or what but they are all lacking. And whats with his obessesion with penis'(whatever the plural of the word is).  I don't even want to touch the final sex scene, when its first referenced in the book I was like, he doesn't mean that but you'll see he does.  Sex/sexuality when it doesn't progress the story is such a waste(although somehow in King's mind the final scene does).   <br />There are some entertaining and funny parts and it kept me turning the page until the last quarter of the book, which is where it all fell apart. (read all the negative reviews and you'll get the gist) I again I was left disappointed and didn't care what happened to the characters.  Previous reviewers were right 300-500pgs could have been easily eliminated.  And although Bill had/has a stuttering problem, and somewhat integral to the story, it was really tedious reading. <br />I gave it 2 stars because it was had some intriging ideas, and I can't help but think Clive Barker (or whoever created the Nightmare on Elm Street) cribbed this heavily. <br /> <br />
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I must've read it in 2 days!  It was just as the editor wrote, \\"funny and surprising.\\"  The plot made the story so compelling.  I'd read it again, and would love to see it made into a movie.  In fact, a movie similar to this storyline is coming out in movie theatres soon, called \\"Invisible.\\" Enjoy the book!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|no, this isn't vintage incubus, stop complaining. keep an open mind because the members of incubus have evolved as artists and musicians. bands that keep the same exact sound from day one usually don't write their own music anyway. people are making it sound like new incubus is comparable to the metallica \\"st. anger\\" mishap (for lack of a better word), but in this case, change is good.     light grenades is extremely impressive. the album will take you in a few different directions, with no two songs sounding alike. i have listened to the album non-stop, and you will pick up on new sounds, subtle or dramatic, with each listen. mike experiments with new sounds on the guitar but never fails to provide his signature sound with his ability to combine effects with ease and clarity. brandon shows excellent range and his intensity is impressive throughout, as always. drum, bass, and sampling work are equally impressive and complement eachother extremely well when not standing out. lastly, the album varies from moving acoustic riffs to upbeat electric melodies, with everything else one can imagine in between the two. the harmonies are 'stellar' and provide an enjoyable auditory experience for fans, new and old.
B000JU7NCE|5.0|I recently tracked down \\"The Cure in Orange\\" DVD which I remember being the best show ever....It was good but I think this one is much better...Jason Cooper is a MUCH better drummer.... and Porl Thompson actually looks cool..... I disagree with anyone who says without keyboard parts there seems to be something missing.......I would state that the keyboard parts at times ruin the Trilogy DVD ( \\"Pictures of You\\" is almost brutal) <br /> <br />They dig out some of their best tunes here.... I bought it for \\"The Baby Screams\\".... and all of it is great! <br /> <br /> <br />a must have....  <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000JK8OYU|2.0|This CD is not the fantastic, crazy mash-up we've all been waiting for.  I eagerly picked this up, thinking somebody had done something weird and wonderful with all those classic tunes, and honestly I couldn't tell the difference in probably half the songs.  Sure, maybe some lyrics are slightly different, maybe the music has been moved around, but most of these tracks could be outtakes from the original sessions.  Either the mixer isn't all that creative or they just didn't take the time. <br /> <br />There's a brilliant mash-up Beatles CD lurking somewhere in the future.  This, unfortunately, isn't it.

So I did and recently I've been making it a point to read mostly classics.<br /><br />Of Mice and Men was a great read because it's a small (unintimidating for anxious people like me) and it was meaningful and exiting.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is a great album.  If you knew my feelings about Kanye West, that statement is rather shocking.  I think West is a fantastically talented hip hop producer.  I believe that he's proven himself to belong on a short list along with Marley Marl, DJ Premier, Dr. Dre and Pete Rock as among the best of all time.      His problem is that he is a mediocre (and that's being generous) emcee.  He tends to depend on crutches that no self respecting rapper would ever allow themselves to be caught on tape with.  For example, his annoying habit of stretching out the last syllable of lines (drives me insane!).  His lack of mic skills is further exposed when compared to the talented guests who appear on THE COLLEGE DROPOUT:  Jay-Z, Common, Talib Kweli, Mos Def.    That being said, Kanye's debut album works in spite of him.  Roc-a-fella was hesitant to release the album and he spent that time tinkering on it to make it perfect in his eyes.  That could have been a dangerous ploy but it ended up working in his favor.  Despite his rapping, the greatness of THE COLLEGE DROPOUT is found in its status as a concept album, Kanye's wittiness, the impressive guest roster and, of course, that fantastic sonic background.

B000IOM1RI|5.0|i originally gave it a rating of four stars because it is short, but then i changed it to five instead... it's not a new album, but an accompaniment to a great movie. the music rocks just as much as the first album. if you like the d then you should buy this soundtrack. it has new material as well as old favs from the HBO episodes that never were recorded in a studio. so... if you like the movie, this wouldn't be a bad addition to your collection. <br /> <br />also, i don't see where the editorial review comes off as saying the d is a fake band. they are most definietly real... they play their own instruments, they sing, they write their own songs, they tour [more than once], and i've seen them live. they just so happened to be in a movie and have a tv miniseries. the monkees are considered a real band and they didn't even write their own songs. so... they're real - i just had to get that off my back.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Terrified to hear new work from Evanescence after the departure of Ben Moody, I almost gave up after the first time I heard \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" because of all that song lacks -  almost everything I ever liked in Evanescence. It felt far too much like they were trying way too hard to have a different sound. After getting the full disc and listening through the entire disc though, I found that song to be alone in its problems.<br /><br />It's a different disc that is more the same as their old work than not. The similarity in the opening track \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" to \\"Going Under\\" from Fallen cannot be missed. Most of the tracks have the signature Evanescence feel, so if you like Fallen you'll definitely like this disc. That the first single from the disc (Call Me When You're Sober) is the worst track on the disc confuses me, but that's the music industry for you.<br /><br />The most noteworthy track in my opinion is Lithium - a magical piece which  has a mood and feel dramatically different from anything Evanescence has done before, and in a great way. This song alone shines brightly enough for the entire album.<br /><br />Finally - I have a huge amount of respect to Evanescence for NOT trying to put out a new song that tries to capitalize on their success with \\"My Immortal\\".  The closest thing is \\"Good Enough\\", but that song has more than enough strength to stand on its own. Overall, if you like Evanescence this is a great sequel disc. Musically its quite similar and Amy's voice is, if anything, stronger on this disc. On the other hand, if you didn't like Fallen there's probably not a lot here for you.
B000002OX3|3.0|The Who's second album falls a bit short of their fine debut, and is redeemed by a handful of slightly above average tracks rather than by great ones.  Some have argued too many songwriters spoiled the record, as all members of the group made contributions. Not surprisingly, Townshend dominates the record. \\"Run Run Run\\" and \\"So Sad About Us\\" are probably the best of his batch, and enjoyable but somewhat slight \\"Happy Jack\\" was the single and most famous track. (Strangely, it is included only among the bonus tracks on the CD re-issue.)  \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\" was his first compostion of epic proportions, and a sign of things to come in the forms of Tommy and Quadraphenia. Daltrey, Townshend, and Entwistle take turns at the mike with equally good results. This is a great song, but it plays much better on the Live at Leeds CD. It is fleshed out more completely, delivered with deserving passion, and is preceded by some humorous on-stage banter. (Wes Anderson was wise to use a live version - which I think is from The Rolling Stone's Rock & Roll Cirus - for the Rushmore soundtrack.)<br /><br />Entwistle began to develop his trademark of writing songs with dark humor and unsettling self-deprecation. On this album, he offers the story of the ill-fated \\"Boris the Spider\\" and \\"The Whiskey Man\\", at tale of alcohol-induced paranoid schizophrenia: \\"Seemingly I must be mad, insanity is fun.\\" Moon throws in the instrumental \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\", a showcase for his feral drumming style, and the surpringly affecting \\"I Need You\\". Finally, Daltrey - a very infrequent songwriter - has only one song on the record, the middling \\"See My Way\\". (Oh yeah, there is also a superfluous cover of \\"Heat Wave\\".)<br /><br />The CD re-issue adds several bonus tracks of fitful quality. \\"Disguises\\", \\"In the City\\", \\"Man With the Money\\", and the characteristically amusing \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" by Entwistle - who may well be the star of the record - help make the disc worth listening to in it's entirety.  But the real problem with A Quick One is that it simply never catches fire. At this point, The Who had shown that they were able to crank out decent singles, and that they had the ability and the inspiration to achieve greater things. However, they had yet to deliver a solid album of all original material. That would change in a big way the following year (1967) with The Who Sell Out. But in the wake of A Quick One, the band still had some work to do before its legendary status would be secured.ety.  But the real problem with A Quick One is that it simply never catches fire.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|After first hearing Corinne Bailey Rae I was hooked. She's the best artist to come out of the UK since Coldplay. This girl will go far with her sweet music. You can hear her beautiful soul in her lyrics. And her voice brings feelings up in you that you didn't know you had. She's amazing! Buy her CD, cause you will never want to stop listening to it once you start!
B000J4QWMC|4.0|I didn't see Miami Vice at the theater this past summer.  It literally got such bad reviews from the major movie critcs (except Richard Roeper) that I didn't want to make the effort.  I purchased the DVD with the Director's Unrated Cut on it a couple of days ago out of pure boredom.  I needed something new to watch and was hoping that maybe the Director's Cut of this film would be better than the theatrical version.  Since I didn't the threaterical version, I can't compare the two.  What I can say, however, is that I really liked this movie and look forward to watching it again in a few days.  Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting too much.  I think Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell did a good job protraying the characters of Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.  I believed them as undercover cops.  I also enjoyed the plot line of them having to infiltrate an international drug cartel and the complications that arised from it.  I mean there's only so many plot lines that a writer can use for undercover vice cops.  The style and feel of the movie was great.  The action was adequately spaced and well choreographed.  I bought into the love interest between Farrell's character and Gong Li's.  All in all, I think it was a pretty good Michael Mann movie.  Like with other reviewers, it did remind me a little bit of Mann's earlier movie, Heat.  As far as Bonus Features go, there's about forty-five minutes of behind the scenes stuff on the disc (along with Colin Farrell being punked by some real-life undercover vice cops), and a nice commentary to the movie by Mr. Mann.  The only reason I'm not giving the movie a 5-Star rating is because there were a few places where I got confused with what was going on, or what was being said between the characters.  I also think that the film was left open-ended.  The head of the drug cartel managed to slip away (actually, he was able to empty his whole estate of everything before the local militia arrived), plus my feeling is that it isn't over between Crockett and Gong Li's character.  Depending on how this film did world-wide, there may be a sequel in the works.  As one reviewer wrote, you either like this movie, or you hate it.  I would certainly suggest you rent the film first, and then make up your mind about buying it.  As for myself, I'm glad that I took a chance and bought it.  This was money well spent!between Crockett and Gong Li's character.  Depending on how this film did world-wide, there may be a sequel in the works.

0618477942|3.0|So well drawn and written, but ultimately unsatisfying. I'll be honest and say I don't know exactly why it didn't satisfy because I did like the story and the drawings are great, but I'll take a stab at it...  <br /> <br />Fun Home seems to try too hard to be a classic novel (with all its richness and intellectual demands), but ends up being (almost) like a \\"novel for dummies\\" instead of a graphic novel. Perhaps this is because the words carry too much of the story and the pictures don't take you far enough away from the words. A graphic novel should expand (upon being read) in both directions - into the visual and verbal imaginations of the reader. I'm not sure where the fault lies in Fun Home, but I suspect the verbal side of the story (while very well written) is simply not suggestive enough and so doesn't expand in the reader's mind.  <br /> <br />I'd like to see an expanded version of Fun Home, with the same overall story, and even the same words (though spread over more pages), but fleshed out with more imagery. This could actually add a suggestiveness to the words that I didn't experience on my reading.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|This is a must have CD.  I also really liked Jim Jones new CD A Dipset Christmas.
B000687M48|5.0|I first rented the DVD portion of this thinking it would otherwise be priced like most other concert DVD's at retail, and not really realizing it was part of the same concert CD package that I had so blatantly ignored upon its release.  I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered through Amazon that not only does this package include both the CD and DVD, but it's priced like a regular CD. <br /> <br />I'm not normally a fan of concert CD's - the live experience usually doesn't translate, in my opinion, without either the visuals of actually *watching* the performance, or the ambience of the venue (including the energy of the crowd around you).  What's left is usually slightly inferior versions of the songs you already know - regardless of the band in question.  (There are exceptions; it largely depends on how complex the studio recordings are and how easy to replicate or expand upon them live.  But there's more that can be done over several months in a studio than in an hour-long live show.) <br /> <br />Evanescence's studio recordings are pretty complex and multi-layered - there's really no way for Amy Lee to sing five different vocal parts at the same time, or to sing her own backing track (she does double up her vocals on Fallen in several cases, which gives them a little different sound).  So I think the expectations some people had for this performance are a little unrealistic - you almost have to wonder if some of the negative reviewers here have ever seen a band live.  As a veteran of countless live shows in all different genres, and as a former metal singer myself with both studio and live experience, I thought her performance here was pretty amazing, honestly.  Her vocal parts are HARD, even on the studio recordings, and she belts them out here with just as much precision as she does on Fallen.  The layering might be a bit thin at times vs. Fallen - that's unavoidable, as she's only got one voice - but she hits nearly all of her high notes perfectly, she is totally on-key all night long, and she sings with passion.  She does seem to get a little tired near the end, but that's understandable if you've watched up to that point! <br /> <br />Oh, and the rest of the band is pretty good too!  The instrumentals sound pretty much the same as they do on Fallen. <br /> <br />I still don't think the CD of this is all that compelling on its own, but luckily Evanescence was smart enough to package the DVD with it and that's the real reason to buy this.  It's easier to get over some of the ragged edges of any live performance when you've got those visuals and the feeling of being in the venue with the band.  They are fun to watch, especially Amy as she works the crowd.  That's the main reason why you go to a live show in the first place; if you just want to listen to them, well, you've got Fallen already.  (Though you don't have the \\"extra\\" tracks that they perform here...)  Some of the cutting is a bit too quick, and the direction gets a little self-indulgent every once in a while - especially near the beginning - but it evens out over the course of the DVD.  If I had one real criticism, though, it's that I would have liked some more straightforward editing - I just want to see the band, I don't need 50 different angles in a 5 second span. <br /> <br />The four promotional videos on the DVD are also a must-have.  You can even sort of see their progression from the local club act they were right around the time of \\"Going Under\\" to the mainstream gothic metal band they became over the next year.  One of my favorite moments is seeing Amy singing underwater in \\"Going Under\\" - she's down there for a long time!  She's gotta be pretty fearless.  (She does this in the new \\"Lithium\\" video also, though not for quite as long.) <br />
B00004BZ16|4.0|When I first listened to Sandinista!, I told my wife that it sounded like what happens when a talented band smokes a lot of marijuana, goes into the studio and leaves the tape running for us to hear everything, warts and all.  There are all sorts of quirky moments, odd sounds, a deliberate lack of focus, and an overuse of dub echo production that leaves one bewildered as to whether this is one of those bad experimental albums that all bands feel compelled to make.   <br /> <br />After several listens on long commutes across L.A., I find myself asking the question, \\"Is this the boldest, most sublime record ever made in western music?\\"   <br /> <br />That is Sandinista! in a nutshell.  It is amazing, confounding, delightful, challenging, maddening, forward-looking, retrospective, ambitious, uncompromising, sincere, hopeful, despairing, pretentious, and above all, compelling.   <br /> <br />Sandinista! feels like the soundtrack to a film or musical that was never made.  That film/musical is the world of 1980 as seen by Joe Strummer and Mick Jones.  <br /> <br />Sandinista! is defined by its diversity of musical styles.  The record embraces nearly every form of music that comprised western music during its day (1980):  rap (`The Magnificent Seven'), motown (`Hitsville U.K.'), punk rock (`Police on My Back', `Somebody Got Murdered'), smooth slow jazz (`Broadway'), big band music (`Look Here'), waltz (`Rebel Waltz'), 60's psychedelic pop (`The Street Parade'), Beatlesque arrangements (`Something About England'), Afro-Caribbean music (`Let's Go Crazy', `Washington Bullets'), ska-jazz (`If Music Could Talk'), 80's new wave (`The Call Up'), Bluegrass country rock (`The Leader', `Midnight Log'), and of course, dub reggae (`Junco Partner', `One More Time').   <br /> <br />There are 36 songs on this sprawling journey, so taking little bites at a time is the best way to approach it.  A good way to get a handle on the record is to divide the tracks into A Lists and B Lists.  Thislist is likely to change, but here is where I stand at the current time: <br /> <br />The `A' List Tracks:  These are the no-brainer classics, quirks and all. <br /> <br />`The Magnificent Seven';  <br />`Hitsville U.K.';  <br />`Ivan Meets G.I. Joe'  <br />`Somebody Got Murdered'  <br />`Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)'  <br />`Police on my Back'  <br />`The Call Up' <br />`Washington Bullets' <br /> <br />The `A-`  List: (not quite A list, but solid tracks that grow on you so much you look forward to hearing them as much as the A list standards): <br /> <br />`The Leader' (The Clash meet Johnny Cash);  <br />`The Street Parade' (which could've been a top 40 hit if not for the overuse of dub production);  <br />`One More Time' (probably the best of the reggae influenced tracks);  <br />`Lose This Skin' (sounds like a cross between a Mississippi riverboat fiddle band and a broadway musical with impassioned singing);  <br />`Let's Go Crazy'  <br /> <br /> <br />The `B+' List:  Songs which have many endearing qualities, but are just a notch below the others: <br /> <br />`If Music Could Talk' (Joe Strummer's favorite) <br />`The Sound of Sinners' (fantastic lyrics and a very catchy gospel chorus) <br />`Rebel Waltz' <br />`Version City' <br />`Charlie Don't Surf' <br />`Junkie Slip' <br />`Kingston Advice' <br /> <br />The B List:  Songs which aren't bad, but haven't really clicked with me, though I know that others like them: <br /> <br />`Lightning Strikes' <br />`Junco Partner' <br />`Something About England' <br />`Midnight Log' <br />`Corner Soul' <br /> <br />The C list:  Everything else.  This includes novelty items, throw aways, dub, and stuff that probably should've been left on the cutting room floor.  Good examples would include `Version Pardner'; `One More Dub'; `The Crooked Beat' and the horrible (though humorous) remake of `Career Opportunities'. <br /> <br /> <br />That's 20 great songs, 5 additional pretty good ones and some novelty tracks that might click with some but not with others.  That is better than most CDs released in any era.  Get Sandinista!  It is a very fulfilling musical journey.  Just don't expect something straightforward like `Give `Em Enough Rope', anything off the first Clash album or even `London Calling'.  This record has more in common with The Beatles `White Album' than most any other Clash record.   <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have read the novel (it is, in fact, one of my all-time favorites) and seen the Broadway musical starring Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman on video.  I was reluctant to watch this film.  After all, I am usually disappointed with Hollywood remakes and I end up making comparisons with the original works. (I recently did that with the new Pride and Prejudice.)  The stars of this film had a lot to do with my hesitation.  I adore Michael Crawford as the Phantom and couldn't imagine someone else playing the part.  I often feel this way about remakes.  If Hollywood ever decides to remake Gone with the Wind (I hope not!), I doubt I'd be able to accept a new actor in the role of Rhett Butler, even if the new actor does a splendid job in his own right.  I felt that way before watching this film.  I thought that gorgeous Gerard Butler had been miscast for the role of the Phantom.  Now that I've seen this film, however, I have to take back whatever prejudices I had before giving it a whirl.  Anyone who has read the book and seen the musical know that The Phantom of the Opera is set in an opera house in 19th century Paris.  The opera house is being occupied by a mysterious masked man who gives singing lessons to young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) and develops an obsessive love for the young soprano.  He'd do anything to make her the star of the opera, including commit murder.  How would he react when he realizes that the object of his affections has feelings for Raoul (Patrick Wilson)?<br /><br />The Phantom of the Opera is beautiful, haunting and tragically romantic.  The love triangle between Christine, Raoul and the Phantom (whose name is Erik, but no one calls him that in this film version) is one of my all-time favorites.  This story has a special place in my heart because it was the one that brought my passion for anti-heroes and wounded souls to life.  In this film, like in the play and the book, I found myself rooting for the Phantom rather than for Raoul.  Gerard Butler does a splendid job in bringing out the Phantom's many complexities and nuances -- giving this compelling character depth.  Butler's Phantom is more vulnerable and less ironic than Crawford's portrayal of the character.  I like them both because they manage to move me, but for different reasons.  The actors' ages and physical appearance are also different.  As said in the previous paragraph, Butler is gorgeous, and he took my breath away when he looked back at Christine during the scene where he takes her to his lair and sings the main title (one of my favorite scenes).  His beautiful eyes are very expressive and they work wonders for me.  I couldn't understand why Christine was so repulsed by his deformity when the rest of him looked so delectable.  That bit of this film version was not realistic.  If I were Christine and seen Butler's Phantom, I would have felt everything but repulsion.  Awe?  Yes.  Fascination?  Absolutely.  Freight?  No way.  This Phantom is too sexy for words.  As for the rest of the main cast, Patrick Wilson is also wonderful in his portrayal of Raoul.  He is the proverbial hero who would do anything for the heroine.  He is also quite boring, but most characters of this type are when put together with a compelling \\"villain\\" like the Phantom.  Wilson's Raoul was nevertheless wonderful and tender and he moved me when he sang \\"All I Ask of You.\\"  Emmy Rossum is quite good as Christine.  She doesn't outdo Sarah Brightman though.  But she does a good job and has a beautiful voice.  Minnie Driver is campy and fun as the diva Carlotta.  I loved her over-the-top prima donna antics.  As for the rest of the film, I agree with those who say the film is campy and over-the-top at times, but you kind of expect that in a musical of this sort (Moulin Rouge anyone?).  Hiring the director of the Batman series was quite appropriate.  The Andrew Lloyd Webber score is of course beautiful!  The music is so haunting and romantic that I cried while listening to it at times.  \\"Think of Me,\\" \\"Angel of Music,\\" \\"The Phantom of the Opera,\\" \\"Masquerade,\\" \\"All I Ask of You,\\" \\"The Point of No Return,\\" and \\"The Music of the Night\\" are my favorites and I adored them in this version.  \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has a modern, Rocky Horror Picture Show-type of sound that is irresistible.  I love the organ sounds throughout the soundtrack.  Everything is splendid. Even Gerard Butler, who I heard hadn't had proper vocal training before doing this film, sounded wonderful here.  His voice is what I'd imagined the Phantom's to be -- husky, dark and masculine.  (I always thought Crawford's singing was a little too high-pitched for my taste.)  But more important than vocal skill, he conveys so much emotion with his acting and singing.  It was breathtaking.  I am definitely getting the soundtrack CD!  The wardrobe and sets are exquisite and lavish, the music is gorgeous, the actors are memorable, and the story and scenes (especially the ones where they show the Phantom's awful childhood and when he and Christine perform \\"Point of No Return\\" near the end, where Butler reduced me to tears until the credits rolled) are dark, mesmerizing and poignant.  Do yourself a favor and watch this film!  Don't let preconceived notions get in the way of enjoying this incredible production.  The DVD transfer of view and sound is top-notch.

0451450523|5.0|After watching the movie quite a few times, I decided it was time to read the book. So I did, and at first I didn't like it too terribly well, but after reading it again and seriously taking a good look at it, I loved it. The author writes with a rather unusual style, but that's what makes this book so unique. I love unicorns (I've always been a bit of a fantasy fan), and this is one of the best books about them that you can find on the shelf. Sure, there are a few thematic elements here and there that I could have done without, and there is a bit of cussing from time to time, but the story itself makes this product a keeper. If you haven't read this book yet, I highly recommend that you do so.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|Dying man reflects on the circumstances that brought him to insanity. Sound anything like The Wall to you? I gave this a listen off the recommendation of my cousin (who also listens to Hendrix, AC/DC, Guns n' Roses and Led Zeppelin - at least he likes MOSTLY good stuff), who called it \\"amazing\\" or something like that. There is something amazing about The Black Parade: it's how unoriginal it is. Besides the usual lowest-common-denominator fake punk with obnoxious lyrics about death(Teenagers, Mama, Dead!, This is How I Disappear), there's also a dreadful power ballad in Welcome to the Black Parade, which I swear gets recycled on two tracks (Cancer, Sleep). And I Don't Love You rips off Coldplay's In My Place. I can't stand Gerard Way's voice, either. So sue me.<br />MCR is essentially another top-of-the-heap rock band that doesn't deserve their place there...<br />Oh, and Famous Last Words is still the worst song EVER.
0380789035|4.0|Although a bit clunky at times, American Gods provides more skillful storytelling then I would have expected.  Gaiman's humor is subtle, his symbolic references are genuine, and his SciFi/Fantasy candor came shining through this work.  This was my first Neil Gaiman novel and it has successfully wet my appetite for more.
B00006LLOG|4.0|Okay, I'm a VU nutcase - that must be said. I bought all four of their original studio albums in a three-week span, if you wanted any proof. I also like Reed's solo stuff, and this is a great record. The wonderfully twisted Walk on the Wild Side was Lou's only top 40 hit, and indeed it's quite a song. But don't, as some have, overlook rockers such as Vicious or Hangin' 'Round, Satellite of Love (featuring David Bowie, who produced the record, singing a great backup vocal); the slightly overblown but still good ballad Perfect Day; the bizarre Andy's Chest, which is a lot of fun; or the hilarious New York Telephone Conversation. Wagon Wheel, I'm So Free and Goodnight Ladies are weak, but overall Transformer is an excellent record. Okay, I'll admit that I miss Reed's expiremental edge (it's interesting that David Bowie, the man behind the excellent Station to Station album, didn't tap into that), and as I said before a couple songs are weak. But hey, it's great, and sure better than the overrated Rock 'n' Roll Animal.
B000060K4O|5.0|1984's \\"Ghostbusters\\" is not only one of the greatest comedies, but one of the best movies ever made. Armed with an amazing cast of comedic talents, a solid storyline, and great special effects, \\"Ghostbusters\\" is a truly magical movie.<br /><br />Three scientists, Pete Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), who specialize in paranormal activity, get fired from their jobs at a renowned New York college. Desparate for some dough, they start their own business, Ghostbusters. At firs, business runs a little slow, until a New York apartment dweller named Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) discovers her refrigerator is a portal to a spiritual dimension ruled by the evil demon Zule. With news of this, their business takes off, as does a relationship with Dr. Venkman and Dana. However, when a sleazy social inspector named Walter Peck challenges the legal matters of their business, the Ghostbusters soon find their business out of operation, and it couldn't be at a worse time, as both Dana and her bumbling neighbor Louis Tully (the always wonderful Rick Moranis) have been possessed by these demons, who are now planning to destroy New York. It is up to the Ghostbusters to stop these dastardly demons before it's too late.<br /><br />This is is an unforgettable movie. The performances, especially Murray's are wonderful. Never has any actor (with the exception of Weaver in the first two \\"Alien\\" movies) been better. The story and the special effects are dazzling, and this is definitely a film that belongs in your dvd collection.

I'm sorry but the character was dull, and the book was so disjointed that I had to read and re-read several parts of it just for it to make sense. And some of it didn't. When it comes to Stephen King books, I will sit up all night reading until I am finished. This book sat half read for about 3 weeks before I finally picked it up and finished reading it.

B000001F75|5.0|Thin Lizzy are pretty much an unknown band in America.  Sure, they may have had one hit, but who really knows anything by this band?  In fact, ask the average person who sings, \\"The Boys Are back In Town\\" and most of em probably won't even be able to tell you.  Those fairly familiar with the band know there was a \\"classic\\" period of their career, but even more obscure are the days before they became a dual guitar powerhouse.  Vagabonds(their 3rd album) is an excellent look into the early days of their career.  Certain critics have mixed reviews of Lizzy's early days, stating that Lizzy had an uneven sound and hadn't \\"found\\" themselves yet.  Sure, they ended up in a much different place than they started, but they certainly don't sound unsure of themselves on this album.  Mixing elements of folk, funk, hard rock, and even psychadelic rock, this album should appeal to fans of stoner rock and trippy hippy rock.  Phil's voice isn't quite as smooth as we know it would become(that could be the production too), but there are hints of what Lizzy would become on The Rocker.  This is a wonderful album to anyone who appreciates Phil Lynott's style as well as any other curious parties who dig late 60s/early 70s music.  This is a surprisingly cool gem to discover.  It might even have you wondering why it never made any kind of impact.
0451196716|4.0|Endings seem to be a weak spot for King. Nowhere is this more perfectly exemplified than in THE LONG WALK. For readers who like to know how things play out for the main characters....don't expect to find out. There is no dénouement. That said, the story is enthralling throughout....no doubt adding to the cheated feeling at the end.

B000001F9E|5.0|As a teenager in the 70s, the Jailbreak LP stayed on my turntable for months. I just couldn't resist those fantastic power chords and melodic lead breaks. After losing track of my vinyl disk years ago, I recently picked up a CD copy. None of the brilliance of this LP has faded. This is truly one of the greatest hard rock albums of all time.  <br /> <br />Besides the great guitar work, Phil Lynott's songwriting is at its peak.  There isn't a weak song in the bunch. Besides the three songs that got all the airplay, Boys are Back in Town, Jailbreak & Cowboy Song, check out the hard driving Emerald and the R&B tinged Fight or Fall. My fav, Warriors, has one of the greatest wah-wah guitar leads ever recorded.  I still get chills everytime I hear it. And the way the song ends - pure brilliance.   <br /> <br />If you don't own any Thin Lizzy CDs, you can't go wrong in picking this one up. It's Thin Lizzy at its best and a classic rock album that has truly stood the test of time.

As we already know hes not just a fab singer he is also a musician. He says he wanted to take his voice where it has never gone before, as he proved it in this CD.<br /><br />Some of the songs are not of his style we all know and love, but that's what makes this CD so special. He intented this to be a mostly English CD,so thats why all the English songs.<br /><br />I took some notes while I was watching the DVD,yes I took notes.... anyway for you that only bought the CD version I'll partly tell some highlights. He said thing like \\"Every songs a journey\\" and every song is for a reason why they were picked. He mentioned, at first he wasn't even sure if there was going to be a 3rd album, and if it worked, it worked, if it didn't, it didn't. Gratifying but it worked. This CD is true to his soul and that he's being him,\\"very me\\"<br /><br />This CD took over a year to make. And if you truly are his fan you should apreaciate all the time and effort he and others put into this CD. \\"True to his soul\\"<br /><br />The songs MAI and UN DIA LLEREGRA were 2 of examples of JG style we all know and love. And to follow was L'ULTIMA NOTTE, SOLO POR TI and VERITA. All great JG classic style. I really liked the Italian version of the song from Romeo and Juliet,(A TIME FOR US)UN GIORNO PER NOI.<br /><br />SO SHE DANCES, I thought it was just a beautiful song, the blowing wind fit well, not to mention the airy ending, great song!<br /><br />IN HER EYES...Josh was playing the drums here, and David Foster was at the keyboards, a very nice song.<br /><br />NOW OR NEVER, a song about a love gone wrong, I liked this too.<br /><br />LULLABY and WEEPING...Josh is very involved in the AIDS problem there in Africa,so he was inspired by this to make these songs. With the help of an South African band of singers these songs were made possible. LULLABY was nice but I liked WEEPING better.<br /><br />Okay, MACHINE! Herby Handcock and JG collaborated on this song.He JG called this the highlight of the album. I LIKED this song! It was very different sound for Josh, defanitly not his typical sound, very Jazzy!Josh stylin' You go Josh!!<br /><br />He has some comments about the song AWAKE...it described how he felt making this album. I think he was concerned how his fans would percieve or even accept this album. He said he took a risk doing this album. He want his present fans to enjoy this and make new fans, as he was very excited and very proud of this album.<br /><br />Well I'm glad I spent the extra bucks to buy this CD/DVD, it was worth it.<br /><br />No matter I will be getting his past concerts DVD/CD eventhough I have the songs on other CDs. He's worth spending money on.  Don't forget Amazon has terrific prices, so I can splerge.cock and JG collaborated on this song.He JG called this the highlight of the album. I LIKED this song!

B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I bought this CD for my girlfriend(who is a huge Incubus fan) and she loved it,she went on to tell me that it wasnt Incubus' best CD,but it was sill pretty good.Im not an Incubus fan like her but I do like some of their songs anyways if your an Incubus fan then its prolly a must-buy for you.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|Ever since I bought this album, I have been unable to stop listening to it, especially at night alone in my apartment. I agree that this is quite different from 'O', but this only proves Rice's incredible talent.  <br /> <br />The album is sparser, with less operatic background from his debut, but I can always turn to the earlier CD when I want that. Here, everything is in the lyrics - there is much more emotional distress in this album, and the 'explicit lyrics' only makes it that more genuine. While there are a few lighter tracks (Dogs, Sleep Don't Weep), the obsidian (shining black gems lol) of the CD (and this is where I disagree with the Amazon reviewer wholeheartedly) are 'Rootless Tree' and 'Me, My Yoke, and I', which are the perfect break-up songs.  <br /> <br />If this album had come out a couple of years earlier, I am almost certain that it would be in its entirety the soundtrack for 'Closer', more so than 'Blower's Daughter' and 'Cold Water' from O.  <br /> <br />Smart, sassy, and socially incorrect - Damien Rice has a (too unique) genius that I've still not found anywhere else.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|i have not read all 145 reviews but have read many of them.  i agree with most of them so i do not want to lavishly praise this movie.  i only want to make two comments. <br /> <br />1.  merry christmas is the most popular christmas song ever made.  yes, i'm aware of bing crosby and white christmas.  test it yourself on christmas season.  count the no. of times you hear each song. <br /> <br />2.  i hesitate to say it's the best movie musical ever made.  how about Gigi?
B00005R1N3|5.0|Before you pine for an \\"old fashioned\\" Christmas, back in the \\"good old days\\", remember that back in the 70's (and before) we did not have caller ID, and tracing a phone call to it's point of origin was a difficult and lenghly process. Why the history lesson?? Simple as it lays an important groundwork for this fright fest.<br /><br />The setting for this movie is pre-Chritmas at a sorority house set at a New England college campus. The sisters are all planning for their trips home for Christmas, and things at the house are winding down. The wiskey ladden house mother, and her charges are a typical lot of coeds. We have a lush, a virgin, and assorted other sorority types.  However we learn that the someone who climbed the treelace into the attic was not in search of shelter, but rather fresh victims, and the coeds start to fall one by one.<br /><br />Through is all the house is subject to a constant stream of annoying sometimes obsence phone calls.<br /><br />Little does anyone know where the calls are really coming from (see my opening notes). This is a true horror movie, it is not long on gore, but very long on fright and horror. The viewer knows just what is happening, but not the coeds.  Does this tale have a happy ending?, no, and that is perhaps the best part.<br /><br />Strong performances are turned in by Margo Kidder, as the lush of the house, and no she did not play the House Mother, Olivia Hussey as a fellow coed who is pregnant, and her VERY creepy boyfriend, Keir Dullea.<br /><br />John Saxon plays the somewhat perplexed Police Officer.<br /><br />This movie was also released under the title Silent Night, Deadly Night.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Wow, what a killer rock album.  I was never all that into Soundgarden or Rage Against The Machine, I have always liked what I have heard from Audioslave, but this is the first album that I have picked up.  This is top notch stuff all the way through.  The songwriting is strong throughout.  The vocals are pristine.  The guitar playing is constantly creative and at times very innovative.  The rhythm section is solid as a rock and there are some killer bass and drums parts to be found throughout.  The album spawned two hit singles \\"Be Yourself\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" both of which are great tunes.  The opener \\"Your Time Has Come\\" is a great high energy to start the album with.  More great rock is to be found with \\"Man Or Animal\\" and the title track.  The band does a great job with ballads to with \\"Heaven's Dead\\" being a highlight.  The band even does a blues number with \\"#1 Zero\\".  Cornell sings in a blues style that fans of his work are probably not used to, but the guy just wails on this tune.  If he ever wanted to move into a more bluesy direction I think he could be very successful at it.  This album to me has more in common with old Soundgarden than it does Rage.  There is no hop hop or rap to be found here, but just straight ahead rock played with intensity and power.  This is a great album!
B000IHY9SE|3.0|But there's a lotta filler too. There's a lotta remixes here because it's a mixtape. Take what you want from that. But you should at least download the songs that are bumpers.    1. Intro  2. We're Back- Good lyrics can't save the dumb beat.  3. Pistol Pistol? Really? They just put an old song on this album, like they're trying to trick the stupid listeners. If you can remember 8 Mile, you remember when this song was hot.  4. Murder- filler  5. Everything Is Shady- The title sounds cool, but the song is average.  6. Re-Up- Good lyrics can't save the dumb beat. I don't like 50 Cent anyway.  7. You Don't Know- the radio smash. But it's good though! The first \\"bumper\\" on the album.  8. Jimmy Crack Corn- filler  9. Trapped- filler.  10. Whatever You Want- A lil better than the filler. At least you won't wanna skip it every time.  11. Talkin' All That- Good lyrics and delivery. Worth some credibility.  12. By My Side- BUMPER. Now we're gettin' to the meat-and-potatoes of this album. With this great song, why did they need to put Pistol Pistol on this album???  13. We Ride For Shady- The beat is awkward, and the lyrics are rough. Mix them together and you got a really good song!  14. There He Is- BUMPER! Some other reviewer actually rated this song 1/5, but that's dumb. This song is rough, and the beat is memorable. And it gave me the chance to hear from an artist who I didn't know about.  15. Tryin' Ta Win- BUMPER. It's raw. It has that crazy marching-band intro, which adds to the desperate tone of this song. If you listen to bubblegum rap, skip this song.  16. Smack That- remix filler. Why is it on THIS album? How does it fit here? Probably just to appeal to casual listeners and sell more copies.  17. Pubic Enemy #1- The first solo Eminem track on this album. Rough. Pretty good. Satisfies your craving for raw Marshall Mathers wordplay.  18. Get Low- Just skip it.  19. Ski Mask Way- Another remix, this time from the Massacre. I hated the Massacre, so I hate this song.  20. Shake That- A remix of a REMIX. That's a headache. Just listen to this track once, because you know you're curious what Nate Dogg will say.  21. Cry Now- Rough, hardcore. Good stuff. I wanna find some more Bobby Creekwater music.  22. No Apologies- BUMPER! The best mainstream Eminem track to come out since his Encore album. This is the song I was waiting for. Marshall sounds as angry as he possibly can. It's too rough for bubblegum fans; sorry kids. LOL
031236198X|5.0|Congratulations for the simple and pleasant way you've found to talk about such a complex and deep subject.  <br /> <br />The book caught my attention in a way that I could not wait to finish it. It's easy to read and makes you crave for \\"what kind of creative solution Fred will provide to the penguin colony?\\" Alice is fantastic: objective and fast. And what about the Head Penguin? I simply loved the way he got the message out  to the colony, telling them who they really are! And you know what? At that point, this chapter also touched me not only professionally but also in a personal way. Who you really are is deep and made me think a lot about it. <br />
B00005JMFQ|4.0|As far as romantic comedies goes, for the most part `Love Actually' nails it.  The only problem I have with this film is that it covers the lives of so many young lovers that no one is truly explored or explained, there's just simply not enough time.   <br /> <br />But that aside, the cast is truly talented and make for a wonderfully delightful time.  Bill Nighy comes to mind right off bat as a real reason to watch this film, for his portrayal of Billy Mack, the washed up rock star vying for a second chance is just utterly hysterical.   <br /> <br />As love triangles are formed, new love blossoms and lasting love begins to fade, a cast that includes Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman deliver laughs and smiles that are sure to please the viewer. <br />   <br />Some of the characters and relationships could have been axed to provide stronger storylines for key characters, but all in all this is a great slice of entertainment and not a bad way to spend some time.
B000002KDS|4.0|From the opening riff of the straight ahead rocker \\"Under My Wheels\\" to the almost Broadway like closing track \\"Killer\\" you know you are in for a wild ride with \\"Killer\\".  Many Alice Cooper fans consider this to be the band's finest hour.  Although it is not my favorite it is a solid Cooper release.  The hits \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Be My Lover\\" are here, but it is the album tracks that really shine.  \\"Halo Of Flies\\" is a great tune where the band gets to stretch out and strut their stuff.  \\"Desperado\\" (written for the recently deceased Jim Morrison) is very a different, but cool tune.  \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" and \\"Yea, Yea, Yea\\" are both good rockers with the band in focus once again on the latter number.  \\"Killer\\" closes up the album with a mock trial and sound effect of a hanging that would once again become the staple of Alice's live shows.  He always gets executed in the end by some means (guillotine, hanging, electrocution, other ways).  The song \\"Dead Babies\\" though would be the song that made Alice the enemy of parents everywhere.  The song is actually about child abuse, but many people misinterpreted it as advocating the killing of babies (or something like that).  The trial sequence that follows in \\"Killer\\" just added to the accusations.  In reality it is kind of a cool song and features Alice's rather twisted view of a serious subject.  The song \\"Be My Lover\\" contains one of my favorite lines \\"She asked me why the singers name was Alice......I said listen baby you really wouldn't understand\\".  At this time in the band's career there were people who \\"understood\\" and those who did not......they lived in two separate worlds.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|Punk fans are often a relentless, unforgiving crowd, so when Rise Against announced that they'd left Fat Wreck for a major label in Interscope, their fans lost their minds. Green Day-style. Then the band released \\"Siren Song of the Counter Culture,\\" which bore a hit in \\"Swing Life Away,\\" and likened the band to bands such as New Found Glory, Dashboard Confessional and Blink 182.  <br /> <br />Having been on both ends of the critical spectrum, Rise Against hooked up with Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson to make \\"The Sufferer & the Witness,\\" or as I'd like to call it \\"Revolutions Per Minute Part 2.\\" the band released \\"Siren Song of the Counter Culture,\\" which bore a hit in \\"Swing Life Away,\\" and likened the band to bands such as New Found Glory, Dashboard Confessional and Blink 182.  <br /> <br />Having been on both ends of the critical spectrum, Rise Against hooked up with Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson to make The Sufferer and the Witness, or as I'd like to call it, Revolutions Per Minute Part 2. <br />\\"Chamber The Cartridge\\" opens the record and it's balls out from there; the bombastic drums paired with Tim McIlrath's throat-y vocals make you realize that this isn't quite pop fanfare their last album was. \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" starts as a mid-tempo song, but when the chorus kicks in, the band goes all out.  <br /> <br />The great thing about Rise Against and their songwriting, is that it's that perfect balance of pop and aggressive; in essence, it's true melodic hardcore. It's those same elements, however, that also bog down the band: their political messages and four chords can only go to a point and you realize that this 13 track album may be two or three tracks too many. <br />Still, when there are bands like Anti-Flag who don't live up to their political hype and Green Day who've earned a Grammy for making a horrible political record, it's nice to know that there's a band like Rise Against on a major label, ready to stick up for the kids, even if they hate them. <br /> <br />- RYAN PANGILINAN.
B000002J03|5.0|Not only is this their greatest album of all time, it also features some of their most underrated songs. <br /> <br />My two favorite songs are Moby Dick, Ramble On, and Whole Lotta Love. <br /> <br />Whole Lotta Love: Awesome, powerful song. The mid-ways rift is mezmorizing in itself. 10/10 <br /> <br />What Is and What Should Never Be: I never cared much for this song. It was okay, but \\"The Rain Song\\" off of \\"Led Zeppelin IV (ZOSO) is a much more dominant slow song. This song just sort of drones on, and not much changes. Still, it's pretty good. 6/10 <br /> <br />The Lemon Song: I like this song. It has some pretty sweet vocals. 8/10 <br /> <br />Thank You: Still not quite as good as \\"The Rain Song\\" but better than \\"What Is and What Never Should Be\\". 7/10 <br /> <br />Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman): I REALLY liked this song somew nice guitar rifts and such. 9/10 <br /> <br />Ramble On: Oh HOW I LOVE THIS SONG. This was the first song by Zepp I ever heard. It came on the radio on the way back from my school. 10/10 <br /> <br />Moby Dick: The best song on the album. No doubt. Everything's perfect. From Jimmy Pages' face-melting guitar, to John Paul Jones' rolling bass rifts, to finally: The drums. This is one of the single greatest drum solos ever constructed. It's insane how he's able to keep it going for the that long. A masterpiece for the ages. John Bonham at his best. Robert Plants' just the acing on the epic cake. 11/10 <br /> <br />Bring It On Home: Finally, they conclude the album with one of John Paul Jones' greatest efforts. Being a bass player myself, I admire his style. 10/10 <br /> <br />I just turned 14, and I'm already a dye-hard Led Zeppelin fan. Buy this album now. <br /> <br />
B000J4QWMC|3.0|`Miami Vice' is one of those movies that tries to do too much, so much in fact that it begins to lose me about half hay through.  Superbly shot and, surprisingly, well acted, `Miami Vice' could have been a lot better.  It's not horrible, but it falters quite a bit and falls short of excellence.  I almost feel the same was I felt when walking out of `Bad Boys II', that the length of the movie overshadowed what it could have been.  I found myself getting ancy for the credits about an hour and a half in and I still had almost another hour to go. <br /> <br />This film really only resembles the TV show in name and location, but the fact that I never watched the TV show kind of voided out that detail.  I actually found the serious tone and gritty direction comforting, because like the `Amazon.com' reviewer stated, this is the type of film that Mann does best.  Mann doesn't deliver solid here though.  I found my attention wavering as the film progressed.  If they had just trimmed a good twenty or thirty minutes from this film it would have served its purpose a little better.  Foxx is a bit annoying here, and while Colin keeps his serious face on throughout the film he ends up becoming a little to stiff. <br /> <br />The plot is your generic undercover cop story, Crockett (Farrell) and Tubbs (Foxx) trying to outsmart drug kingpin Montoya (Luis Tosar).  Along the way Crockett falls for the dangerous girl Isabella (Gong Li) while Tubbs' girlfriend, fellow Detective Trudy (Naomie Harris), is kidnapped and used as leverage by the bad guys.  All of this has happened before; I think I even saw most of this in `Bad Boys II' except Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are mush more entertaining.   <br /> <br />This is not the type of movie that's supposed to inspire or cause you to think, it's merely supposed to entertain, and while it does do that at times it fails to overall impress me or draw me to watch it again, at least not anytime soon.  I was set to be impressed so I think thatmay be why I'm a little overly disappointed.  The action sequences were spectacular, real and gritty and just what you'd want to see in a film of this nature, but even those, as great as they are, couldn't save this movie from generic disappointment.  Trim it down a little bit and I'll give it another shot.
0375704027|4.0|Norwegian Wood was translated by Jay Rubin. The people at Amazon often don't identify translators, but they should.  Of Murakami's principal translators, Rubin and Philip Gabriel can be depended on to produce conscientious, elegant English versions without taking unjustifiable liberties with the text.  If you enjoy a book you're reading in translation, you can thank the translator as much as the author.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|This album is the furthest departure from where Stefani began her ride to pop stardom. After spending some time with the album - I'm just wondering... where's the singing? If I would have wanted to buy some inane hip hop, two words together to a cheese beat, I would have bought the Fergie CD... If you're expecting her previous effort - you're in the wrong place. It sounds like Justin Timberlake and Gwen wrote and recorded their music together but in the end JT got slicker production. <br /> <br />On a pass/fail - this album doesn't work for me. Anyone want to buy my copy?
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|There's little that I could add to the testimonials that have already been written here . While none of these performances would be an absolute first choice for me, save Bertini's Mahler 8th (which IS extraordinary), all of them have an amazing consistantcy in style, sound quality, and orchestral execution. The inclusion of a really fine \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\", expertly sung by Ben Heppner and Marjana Lipovsek, makes this a clear front runner. While Bertini didn't record a complete Mahler 10th symphony (finished by Deryck Cooke and others), his M10 Adagio is outstanding - giving the feeling of completeness on to itself. In fact, other than Leonard Bernstein, I can think of no other conductor who has been so satisfying in capturing the complete emotional range of Mahler's symphonies; going from the fresh and youthful first symphony (and Bertini is truly fresh and youthful); working on up to the cosmic orgasm that is the 8th symphony (and Bertini is cosmically orgasmic here), and still making the drastic shift to the zen-like, other-worldliness of the so-called farewell trilogy: \\"DLvdE\\", 9th symphony, and 10th symphony adagio. He runs the entire gamut, Janet.    Much positive has been written about Gielen's fine Mahler cycle. But his box set doesn't include his recording of the Cooke 10th (Chailly's does!), which is really a very good 10th. It's also more expensive. In addition, getting Gielen's Mahler 6th separately also gives you a really fine performance of Alban Berg's \\"Three Pieces For Orchestra\\" - a very natural coupling for that dark work. Better to pick and choose with Gielen, I think. If you want a box, get the Bertini.
