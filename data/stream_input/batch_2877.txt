0143113100|4.0|It has opened my eyes and given me hope. I learned about this work from reading a fiction book. It was part of his list of resources.
B000001GS0|4.0|This is a remarkable Brahms symphonic cycle. It contains a really outstanding first, one of the best<br />in discography, a great 2nd, a bit fast but exciting and compelling. On the other hand, a problematic 3rd,<br />well played but plenty of mannierisms, excepting a thrilling 1st movement. Finally, an average 4th, great<br />in the middle sections but very slow in key passages. In summary, good cycle, with a thrilling 1st as a<br />highlight, but we could find better cycles under batons such as Sanderling, Celibidache (Stuttgart) and<br />Abbado, if you want Brahms by the Berliner Philharmoniker.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game.  The design of the app is superb.  It is easy to use as well as being versatile.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb is super fun. there is a game called mountain climb race and exactly like this game.also check out mountain climb race.( his headrolls off when you crash.)<br /><br />  IIIIITTTTTTSSSSS CCCCCRRRRAAAAZZZZYYYYY FFFFUUUUNNNN.  CHECK IT OOOOOOUUUUUUUTTTTTTT
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive game , great graphics and good story line. Good free game . Game has different objectives to make the game interesting .
B008I34ZQG|5.0|The only song on the album I really care about is \\"Yo Mamma\\"; between the opening and closing vocals comes a beautiful extended introduction leading to a soaring solo that is among Zappa's very best.  I've had it on vinyl since it came out, and on CD, but have not yet bought the new release.  Since the only way to get \\"Yo Mamma\\" is to buy the album, the album is a must buy.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Riveting heart tugging courageous story in a time when American innocence was drowning.  You cannot turn away from this one.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|And nice twists. Characters staying true to original series and continuing to entertain with action, both predictable and unpredictable twists, and humor resulting from character personalities and tension.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Have this on PC and now Android.  It's a great game and good way to pass some time while still being able to play one 'mission' for a quick fix.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|have not viewed yet but will be watching in the near future it appears new with no problems, Thank you so much
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I don't use the swype feature but the word prediction is so much better than the stock keyboard.  Really speeds up replying to emails and text messages.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This series should have been written in 2 books.  Too much of the same stuff - you also knew the ending from its beginning.  Also the one big surprise at the end I had figured out several pages beforehand.
0062255657|5.0|I have enjoyed every book Neil Gaiman has written. This is no exception. I bought this first in hard cover and then for my kindle. Like everything Neil Gaiman writes, this is a treasure.<br /><br />sis
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|this game is awesome I love it, it has lots of great clothes and boys! I love this game its so cool! :)
1619696231|5.0|Pay attention. This is an interesting story with audacity and ambition that extends one's imagination to the elastic limit. I have this in audio-book form and find that I understood more and enjoyed it better upon the second time around.<br /><br />Great story and great readers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it<br />it is a really really fun game every ages should play it and also it has really good gromming to.
B003EY62II|5.0|This is a good cheesy movie, one that points out the importance of friendship and forgiveness. My 5 year old has watched it a good 30 times since purchase 3 weeks ago. and I still love Scooby-Doo myself, so it's one of those rare movies we can enjoy together.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is a class act, fun to watch, great, really fantastic sets, er...castle!  Great acting as well, really grabs you and holds you throughout the show.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I don't know why it took me so many years to read this book. I guess because,I have seen too many movies. Thought I'd be bored beyond belief. I was not. I got caught up in a story I thought I knew,but didn't. I switched from audio to ebook, and can honestly say I enjoyed both equally. When I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer I would listen as long as I could. As soon as I woke,I continued. I was amazed. If you've never read Dracula, but have a liking for(GOOD) vampire stories,I suggest you READ THIS BOOK.
B00BPCU28C|5.0|Love this movie. I teared up when Cinderella showed up. How can you not love Sofia? Cutest thing ever. The dvd also came with a little booklet for making your own paper crowns and the dvd itself has 3 episodes of the Disney Junior show. Great Value! Love it!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I have watched this movie several times since I received it and Amazon continues to knock it out of the park.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game was somewhat challenging but there needs to be more levels!!!  Some of the higher levels were less difficult.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I was used to stock android's keyboard, which was good already. I downloaded this b/c there was a promotion to get it for free. It is slightly faster than stock keyboard, but it takes a bit of configuring to get the theme that you like. If you type long emails then this app would be great! & the word prediction works well.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|like if you play the game for 15 minutes it stops and you have to pay 0:99 to go on.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love this app! Lots of templates to choose from. I would recommend this app for anyone that loves to play manning.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I loved this move, better yet my teenage daughters loved this move... and not just because Chris Pine is a blue-eyed \\"cutie\\" (their words). I'm not an old school trekkie with heartburn over the plot of these two most recent additions to the franchise. I have seen and enjoyed every Star Trek movie so I recognize where some of the challenges come in when considering the story of these two.<br /><br />That said, it is a well-made, well-acted movie. If you are going to have a modern day Shatner, Chris Pine is it. In fact I can't imagine anyone, and I realize this is rare, that could possibly step into this role and do a better job. Zachary Quinto as Spock is equally as good and between the two they make a perfect duo. All the casting in this movie is spot on with the exception of Peter Weller who, while good, tends to over do it in some spots.<br /><br />The action was great and paced perfectly. What makes this movie are the serious moments that are deftly placed in the midst of action and comedic moments synonymous with Trek movies. In fact, without giving away a spoiler, there is a moment toward the end of the movie where I looked over and my two teenage daughters and wife sat with tears in their eyes. My thoughts at that moment, were that is exactly how it's done and I tipped my hat to Abrams for having a sense for the moment.<br /><br />Bottomline is I give it 5 stars for entertaining me and turning my daughters into closet trekkies. We watch a lot of movies as a family and my daughter turned to me at the end and said \\"Top Five for me, I loved it!\\". Money well spent and an evening worth remembering.
B000002J09|5.0|I want to talk a bit about Stairway to Heaven.<br />For those of you who haven't heard this album<br />(you're living under a rock I presume)<br />it's a great piece of work, and arguably their best.<br />For those of you who have indeed heard it, please read on.<br /><br />This is something I am curious about, as might you be also.<br />I suppose believing in a spirit realm or not has quite a bit of bearing<br />on your opinion about this matter. Putting those opinions aside,<br />I'd like to hear thoughts on what gives a piece of music a sinister quality.<br /><br />Most of us have heard the tales of Jimmy Page's<br />alleged attempts to raise ancient demons and devils<br />via the Thelema rituals in Aleister Crowley's secluded Boleskine mansion<br />in an effort to find 'assistance' with the band's tunesmithing.<br />Stairway to Heaven is the most cited example of the fruit of this effort.<br />It is the most requested radio rock and roll song of all time.<br />And then there's the reverse messages found in the song itself.<br />In particular, during the fifth verse just after the drums kick in, it clearly says:<br />'Here's to my sweet Satan. There's power in Satan. He will give you 666.'<br />Food for occultic thought indeed, if you believe in that sort of hocus pocus.<br /><br />Listening to the song last night I had a foreboding feeling.<br />The A minor walk-down is suggestive of a middle eastern spiritual motif,<br />but the song never really hits you anywhere but on a gut level,<br />missing the 'higher self', or 'the better angels of our nature' altogether.<br />It's seductive qualities stir feelings of a sinister delight in you,<br />reaching a kind of self empowering orgasmic zenith<br />during those first few notes of the guitar solo.<br />Even if you don't believe in malevolent, supernatural beings<br />with the ability to imbue supernatural power to earthly musicians,<br />it's hard to deny the otherworldly quality of the song.<br />And it really makes me wonder.es me wonder.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie, like all of what I consider 'great art,' is not simple to understand and cannot without difficulty be comprehended at the first try. What makes this film brilliant is its ability to create a cohesive story using the themes, characters, and nuances of a series of seemingly unrelated stories. Each small story could become its own movie but is instead incorporated into the whole through minute connections throughout the narrative. Each scene transitions using an actor or element from the previous scene, and as you watch, the connectedness of each story becomes more apparent. Essentially, this story tells six stories at once while maintaining the suspense of each without sacrificing from the meaning of the whole. This genius for combining themes, characters, motifs, and episodes matches the kind of skills need in classical composing, which is why i believe the \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet\\" becomes the inspiration for the title. The movie is a place where characters come and go continuously throughout time meeting each other in different places. This work is not for everyone, but magic of it does not leave easily those who dare to comprehend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this app best ever!! It was awesome!! It was challenging yet fun...I really enjoyed  it!! Best ever!! Loved it!!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|The usual angry birds experience minus the ad. Still fun, like the fact that now you can register your profile and save your progress across devices.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I got a new phone and it didn't transfer over... I missed SwiftKey so much! Got it free from Amazon the other day, yes,!
B008Y7Y0AM|5.0|It's so awesome to see a band like this keep going after all the years that they've treaded on for. this is a great new album - i dont know what else to say about it. I've already heard that they plan to keep going forward - so there we mdb fans have it ....<br />Keep up the good work, MDB !!!!
0345803485|5.0|Obviously one of the best series I've read in a while. Great read. Racy topics but after book 1 the story line draws you on! Must read!
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|eeeegggghhhhh - good album but I was expecting more .... to be honest. good songs as always. just not as impressed anymore.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awsome with the new update, I love large chests. Especially the moon and stars.You must buy this app.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|great new album - it's awesome to see them carry onn , especially after the loss of the bass player. excellent job gentleman. excellent.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It makes me think more I love it . It's good for doing something when your bored it's good for anything .I just love how I can easily figure it out more people should get this app
B000FP2ZCQ|5.0|I just never had the chance to actually pick this one up - I finally did it .... simply awesome ....
B0074YVW1G|5.0|Supported by research and articulated with a lawyer's knack for balance, Quiet explores the inherent gifts of introversion without denigrating extroverts. With her open and friendly voice, intelligent insight and subtle manner, Susan Cain is the ideal spokesperson for our tribe.
B00BDSRFG0|4.0|this new album is good. not below my expectations - just good. I quess want the new singer out and the old singer back in. maybe i've got some adjusting to do.
B0002234LS|5.0|a Stephen king fan finding this on dvd finally and picking it up. awesome movie that I just had to have.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|being a fan of all the original alien movies - I had my doubts about this one. Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised buy this one. obviously everyone was expecting more action this time (especially after such a long hiatus) and they didn't get it. drama replaced most of the action, and that is not knocking the acting down. the fans had such high expectations and some of them got let down. they shouldn't feel that way. this is what ridley gave us and its a pretty good helping of the vision that was originally intended.<br />that is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.
B00902MCVY|3.0|what happened ?? we waited and waited - there's just not enough here. Time 2 had better live up or else wintersun will end up at the back of the pack instead of the forefront.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|saw this double feature on amazon and pretty much had to have it. classics that are a must have. so affordable as well.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Lots of laughs through this book. I am a dude and enjoyed it. Tina has lots of great stories to tell.
0345525558|3.0|This book had some heart wrenching moments and doesn't really promise<br />\\"happily ever after\\", but ultimately offered hopefulness. I really enjoyed the references to the meaning of flowers and how they were used to connect people in the book.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It was an easy and fun read.. Something different.. I appreciated the story line.  I would recommend the book for a quiet Friday night read.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I saw the previews for the second installment to this movies series and had to have the first one before I could watch the second.  It is well worth the money.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Where else can you get 13 games in one.  This is a great addition to anyone's collection.  Metal Gear is a great game.
B005LAII4E|3.0|I grew up watching the cartoon series and had most of the figures when I was small.  I love the first movie but this movie a disappointment.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I enjoyed the humor embedded as well as outright.  Bought the DVD to watch it again before seeing Red 2 and it was fun to see it dovetail to the new Red 2.
140006922X|4.0|Although the book is quite interesting, Mr. Aslan has been show to have taken many liberties to prove his point.  This should be unnecessary since he is a riveting, fast paced writer.  I enjoyed it for the general overview of the times.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a great pick up and put down style game. Great old school Missle command feel but the upgrades and repairing the buildings really make it fun.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This is a great love story with a little action added to the story. Kinsella is very funny and a great author.
1589795474|2.0|I expected better advise.  This book is dissapointing because of vague examples and no real direction of how to make money
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|In the preface, the author admits to a personal agenda about Jesus and Christianity. Though the scholarship is first rate, well documented, and simply presented, scriptural texts he deems factual are selectively chosen to support the author's contentions concerning the historical Jesus of Nazareth apart from his Christliness.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Wish there was some directions because I am stuck on a level until I figure out what I am supposed to do.  It's okay and it was free.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I haven't played it yet, but it looks interesting.  it was free so why not try it, can't be all bad.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome I should see everyone play it all I play now is this game  play it and rate it
B0063GORYU|3.0|If you never win or always win it's no fun I like trying to beat my own time. I come back to it often.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Yet again I have read a book without guessing the end. I love being wrong when reading a book and this one did it. Seriously mysterious. Can't wait to read on and see the books depiction on the big screen.
B00CJGP116|4.0|Great Album but he has done better ones.  It seems that he was in a hurry to get it done.
B009O07NMA|3.0|I thought it would be better.  It's got some good songs, but that is about it.  I don't know if I would buy all of the album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft so awesome me and my dad play it every single day it so fun to play  every single day
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|A visual confirmation of how I suspect Congress really works.  There is no concern for the electorate, only the elected.
0143039431|5.0|What a great book. Yes it's a book about the little guy getting squeezed out by the big banks and farms, but to me, that wasn't the main theme of the book. It merely provided the catalyst for a story about what people do when faced with hardship. It's a story of survival, and how people respond differently to the circumstances that befall them. Some run. Some give up. Some keep fighting until the end when there's no hope in sight.<br /><br />The writing was excellent, with just enough \\"Okie-isms\\" to make it that much more real. I felt as if I were right there experiencing what the Joad family was up against, from broken down engines to having no food to a truck stop with a nickel juke box. If you like stories about survival, and what lengths people will go to in order to make it to the next day, I think you'll enjoy this book.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I recommend this device and the other withings devices. I have the body weight device also. I can use other services and all the information is displayed on the mobile app and the website.<br /><br />The device can be carried with two different cases that come with the device. I use them both. I had a fitbit but I lost it because the case did not stay on my belt. So, I went with this device and I haven't had the same issue.
0399255370|4.0|My three-year old greatgranddaughter got bored after we got to 'beige', but my son told me he had to read her the book a half-dozen times when they went to visit her so I guess her interest was piqued.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is by far one of their greatest records.  Hope to get it on vinyl next.  four more words required
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Better then the first movie. I like the new music that they added to the movie but still kept the 20s theme.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I find this game frustrating because the zoom is not powerful enough to be able to find the objects.  Also, the game's components are confusing to follow.  I don't find this game as rewarding as others, but maybe I'm just a simpleton :)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Read the book since two generations of my family, father and son, both suggested I read it. Didn't hurt being a Monty Python, Ultra-Man, and early video game fan. Hectic pacing and fun characters kept the story interesting even through lulls. Perfect summer read!
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|Exactly what I expected.  A light hearted comedy with 2 sweet actors.  Saw a little bit of myself in the mom - definitely a &#34;back off&#34; wake up call for my own children.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This was one of the first. games I downloaded onto my girlfriends Kindle and now she has to fight me for it! Every morning when I wake up part of my routine is hitting the bathroom and this game keeps me company! The replayability of this game is insane. And just when you might get a board of these missions they flip the script and now you get to play as the bad guys and start all over again! My only issue is it should be called Samurai VS Demons but that's just me.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Bittersweet portrayal of aging and old rivalries among opera singers and musicians. The four principal actors are excellent and the story of finding love in one's later years made me a little weepy.  I always enjoy Maggie Smith and Billy Connelly is funny throughout.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Book vs TV Show Review<br /><br />*** My review may contain some unmarked, minor spoilers for the TV show. These unmarked spoilers will be minor events that happen in the early or middle episodes. I won't discuss any major events, or events that happen near the end. ***<br /><br />If you decide to read Orange is the New Black because you love the TV show, turn back now. That's what I did. Let's first talk a bit about the TV show and what it's all about:<br /><br />* The TV show portrays prison as being scary and potentially dangerous.<br />* Piper gets \\"starved out\\" (denied food) by the inmates who work in the kitchen.<br />* The TV show is filled with sex and drugs.<br />* The COs are extremely corrupt. They put people into the SHU for almost no reason, they assault women, they smuggle drugs into the prison, etc.<br />* There is a lot of relationship drama between Piper and her fianc&eacute; Larry. They both struggle with the separation and long distance, and then things get worse when Piper realizes that Alex (her ex-girlfriend, the one who got her into drug trafficking) is in prison with her. Piper has a bit of a lesbian affair with Alex and that obviously puts a strain on her relationship with Larry.<br />* Tons of drama between the prisoners as well. Grudges, stalking, harassment, and even murder attempts.<br /><br />Orange is the New Black the book has almost none of those things.<br /><br />The book sends a very different message about women's prison. It almost seems to say, \\"Women band together and support each other in prison,\\" which is NOT what the TV show conveys. As soon as Piper stepped into prison (in the book), I knew it was vastly different from the TV show. Left and right women were welcoming her, asking her if she was okay, and giving her \\"welcome gifts\\" (shampoo, etc.). Literally not a single inmate was mean to Piper (or anyone, really).<br /><br />I know the fact that the women were all nice to each other is supposed to be a good thing, since this is a memoir. Speaking in terms of real life, it's great that women support each other in prison, but the lack of drama does make for a less interesting story. (And I feel terrible to be basically saying, \\"Your life isn't an interesting story,\\" but I don't know how else to put it...)<br /><br />One of the biggest differences between the book and TV show is that Alex (named Nora in the book) isn't even in prison with Piper at all. As expected, this cuts out a lot of the intensity and drama, and it means there are basically zero relationship problems between Piper and Larry. I'm sure the separation was hard on them, but there were no doubts or moments where they thought their relationship wouldn't make it (at least none that were conveyed in the book).<br /><br />While I did enjoy reading Orange is the New Black to get a bit more background information on Piper's situation, I didn't find the book to be that entertaining. Although, I guess since the book is a memoir, it is supposed to be more informational than entertaining. The book is almost written in a diary entry style. It's not really a \\"from beginning to end\\" type narrative; it's a collection of entries that describe events. But there were long periods of time where I felt like nothing interesting was happening and it was just another \\"not so bad\\" day in prison. The book seriously lacked conflict because everyone in prison was just so damn nice, and as a result, I got a bit bored.<br /><br />Ultimately, I just went into the book for the wrong reasons. I got hooked on the drama from the TV show and was hoping the book would show me how bits of that panned out... like that crazy cliffhanger at the end!! (view spoiler) But there is almost ZERO connection between the TV show and the book, except for the very vague, overall story of a woman going to prison for a 10-year-old drug crime.<br /><br />== The TV Show: I recommend it! ==<br /><br />The TV show is interesting and full of drama. There is quite a bit of nudity and sexual scenes, so it's not for the faint of heart. But it's interesting, addictive, and loaded with prison scandals and relationship problems.<br /><br />The one downside is that the Piper portrayed in the TV show isn't always the most likable person.  I often yelled at her for making stupid decisions that could result in her getting more time added onto her sentence (how stupid could she be??).<br /><br />== The Book: don't read it for entertainment ==<br /><br />The book lacks conflict and entertainment value. If you're interested in a fairly detailed account of what prison life is like for women, give it a read, but don't go into it expecting it to be anything like the TV show. There are no scandals, there's no drama, there's no lesbian love affair (in fact there's zero sexual activity), there are no COs smuggling drugs into prison, and Piper and Larry's relationship holds up just fine.sexual scenes, so it's not for the faint of heart.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|These were an HBO series on Iraq. They are a reality based fiction story of a Marine Unit in Iraq. Excellent is an understatement.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|This game is super addicting. I love it and so does my sister. I wish there were more levels though. I have the full version. I recommend it :)
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|Do not know how to correct this.<br />Do not want to pay for all these kids games but they have been billed to my American Express Card.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I don't care if you have a link to other appa somewhere in the app but I shouldn't have to go through a screen forcing me to view all your apps ever time I want to llay
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|WOW!!! This is definitely one of the best ways to spend your money right now. With all of the electronic and dub-step stuff, (which, I'll admit, I listen to a little bit of) this album is refreshing to a fault. It's awesome that Ariana has taken the time and effort to make a return to great studio production and genuine songwriting. I've had the album for less than an hour and I promise I won't stop for days! Ariana is one of the most gifted singers that is out there right now. I am so glad that someone pointed out to me \\"Ariana can sing!\\" during her Victorious days of being overshadowed by Victoria Justice. GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Excellent series, looks like UK version has more material (wedding?). Love it. Looking forward to the next season. Especially love that it is available on prime for free.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was hooked on Swype, as it comes with the Galaxy line of phones. I had really gotten used to it. Finally tried SwiftKey on recommendation from a friend. Much more accurate and better at interpreting what my swiping means. Far and away the better keyboard. The only thing I miss is the large number pad that Swype had with a long press of the key.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Must see if you like ensemble casts in a somewhat quirky but highly entertaining action movie. Looking forward to Red 2.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book is a series of interviews given from every point of view imaginable in the apocalyptic war against a mysterious zombifying outbreak. I found it difficult to put the book down because I was so engaged in this concept of how different nations of the world might fare against this common enemy--an aspect that we don't get to see much in contemporary, American zombie lore. It was engaging and suspenseful at times, and even though the nature of the book did not allow for the reader to become very invested in any one character, I did find myself and other people that I've known in any number of these characters, and I think, ultimately, that was the point of the story: to demonstrate how differently the same story can be told by folks from all walks of life. It was a highly entertaining book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of post-apocalyptic literature. Brooks did a bang-up job with his research, too, as far as I can tell. Very nicely done.
B009A882D0|4.0|3rd copy is not good. 1st 2 copies are enough for me to enjoy. Remind me when i was Young. Thanks
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I am glad this was the free app of the day at Amazon, would have been disgusted if I had paid 2.99 for it. The opening screen is full of advertising, great for kids to click on something, go to a web site, and purchase something using your Amazon account.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I really like this game and it could be great, but control is not friendly and the gets really hard (impossible to achieve even 3 drops) at times.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|What excellent people to allow in your mind, heart and home. I appreciate their humor, their humanity, their strength. I still am stunned by the genius of Gene Roddenberry.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I really enjoy Lee Child's character, Jack Reacher. His bigger than life exploits keep me riveted. right to the end.

B00BP4W3WI|5.0|Loved it....again.  It was even a little better watching it with my own kids in our living room than how I remember it watching it on the big screen when I was a kid.

0545586178|5.0|They should have to be a disclaimer on this series; don't start reading these if you need to leave the house in the next 2 days.  Loved all three of these books, but Cathcing Fire was the best.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|Typical Cirque, but with the editing, cutting, special features, etc the movie making allows - it becomes a treat.  Worth the purchase.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Rented this movie for my kids before and my 2 year old daughter LOVED it! A few nights ago she spotted an ad and saw just the top half of Rapunzel's face and started begging to watch the &#34;princess movie&#34;. So I rented it on Amazon because I spoil my baby girl. This movie is really cute. Its a cute story, the songs are catchy, there are some rather amusing parts in the movie, and overall its just a great movie. It was entertaining enough that everyone in the family enjoyed watching it from beginning to end
0140042520|5.0|This is only the second Kerouac book I have read, the first being [[ASIN:014312028X On the Road]], but it seems to me like Kerouac was essentially writing the same book with variation over and over again. I do not mean that to be a criticism at all. I think all good writers (and philosophers) essentially write the same book over and over (F. Scott Fitzgerald had a quote about this that I am too lazy to look up). That is what life is like as well. We constantly engage in the same search, over and over, and we may gain a little wisdom each time through, but ultimately we just have to begin again. Kerouac, who is Ray Smith in this book, definitely seems to have gained some wisdom between [[ASIN:014312028X On the Road]] and this book. Ray still finds himself clinging to charismatic figures who he thinks represent salvation or enlightenment or escape but he has traded Dean, a high-energy petty criminal, for Japhy, a backwoods Zen enthusiast, or Dharma Bum. Ray follows Japhy up a mountain, then to his shack, and then spends a summer up on Desolation Peak as a look out.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:014312028X On the Road]] there is not really much of a traditional plot in this novel. Kerouac was not writing a traditional novel with this book. Kerouac's books are about seekers and the lives of seekers. At one point Ray says to Japhy \\"I ain't gonna rest till I find out why, Japhy, why\\" (201) The why Ray wants an answer to is \\"why is so mean, this Eternal Scene, just what's the point, of this whole joint?\\" (105). Kerouac's novels are about people who are pursuing the \\"why\\" and they are structured like the search: confusion and sadness, an insight, return to confusion and sadness, repeat. Kerouac was too good an artist, and too honest of a human being, to produce a work where there is some big final insight that finally answers the \\"why\\" question. Ray has moments where he feels like all is revealed. Late in the book on Desolation Peak Ray has such a moment of realization, \\"'Poor gentle flesh,' I realized, 'there is no answer.' I didn't know anything anymore, I didn't care, and it didn't matter, and suddenly I felt really free\\" (240). But, of course, that is not the end, and Ray eventually has to come down from Desolation Peak, back \\"down the trail back to this world\\" to begin all over again (244).<br /><br />There is a fair amount about Buddhism in this book and some readers have been critical of Kerouac's understanding of Buddhism and Zen but I think they are missing the point. It is easy to see other people's errors, especially since the modern Zen enthusiast has way more access to Zen literature than Kerouac would have had, but people forget that life is just one big error after another (one continuous mistake). We must have the courage to pursue our errors because it is only by pursuing our errors to the point of dead ends that we ever learn. If we just sit at home and rest in our feeling of being right forever we will never get anywhere. Life is about living our errors honestly until we eventually come to see for ourselves that they are errors. Ray should not, in other words, be trying to get everything right about Zen right at the beginning, he should just live his errors honestly and sincerely, as he does. Ray, in this book, has just recently been introduced to the Dharma, and he is excited about it, as people tend to be when they think they have discovered something new. With maturity (and if Kerouac had not died prematurely as a result of his alcoholism) his errors in understanding would have been corrected by life itself. I do not think anyone would question Kerouac's sincerity and that is what really matters. If you are sincere and honest you will eventually discover your errors. Errors are not really that important anyways. If salvation depended on having exactly the right opinions about everything it would be cause for universal despair.<br /><br />There are a few moments where I think Ray manages to get to the heart of Buddhism.At one point in the book Ray wonders why Japhy \\"is so mad about white tiled sinks and 'kitchen machinery' as he calls it? People have good hearts whether or not they live like Dharma Bums. Compassion is the heart of Buddhism\\" (132) In another place Ray is back at home, he has been spending his nights meditating, and having all sorts of very intellectual sounding insights into the emptiness of all things, but, at one point, he says \\"There were now early spring mornings with the happy dogs, me forgetting the Path of Buddhism and just being glad\\" (141). I think Ray comes closer to the essence of Buddhism in such moments than he does when he is intellectualizing about the emptiness of all things. It is true that this is not really a very good book to learn Zen from, for that I would recommend picking up a book by D.T. Suzuki, but it is a great book for anyone interested in exploring the human condition.<br /><br />The one thing that I do not like about Kerouac is that his search is surprisingly extroverted. His narrators always seek salvation in some external figure or a new way of life or visions of emptiness. His characters never spend a lot of time exploring the dirt beneath their feet. Ultimately, I think Kerouac himself was undone, despite his best intentions, by his own psychological and emotional problems, that he never seemed really capable of facing directly (and I should be upfront and say I know almost nothing about his life; it is merely a sense I get from reading his books). This may be partly a matter of personal preference but I tend to prefer authors who explore the psyches of their characters, who try to dive into the unconscious, and unravel their emotional problems. It is, of course, possible to go too far in either extreme. One can certainly pursue introspection too far but Kerouac's characters seem to me to be almost totally lacking in introspection. Ray never stops to wonder, for example, why he has to drink all the time, even though Japhy makes an issue out of it. He just says that \\"wine is holy\\" and imagines that he is pursuing some kind of divine Dionysian life.<br /><br />Still, Kerouac is very honest about his emotional reactions. He does not get lost in blind optimism. There is a passage late in the book that I love when Ray is on Desolation Peak and \\"Mad raging sunsets poured in seafoams of cloud through unimaginable crags, with every rose tint of hope beyond, I felt just like it, brilliant and bleak beyond words. Everywhere awful ice fields and snow straws; one blade of grass jiggling in the winds of infinity, anchored to a rock\\" (240). It is these lyrical descriptions of the human condition in its search for wisdom that I think are the main reason people keep coming back to Kerouac, despite the fact that his novels lack traditional plots, and despite the fact that authorities on Zen have often claimed he totally misunderstood Zen. I think the authorities on Zen have forgotten that not every book written is meant to be a treatise on Zen. This surely isn't, but it is a beautiful novel that manages to express, in often heartbreakingly lyrical prose, the joy and sadness of being human.At one point in the book Ray wonders why Japhy \\"is so mad about white tiled sinks and 'kitchen machinery' as he calls it?

B009O2XY12|1.0|I really love these kinds of games, and I was enjoying this one till I reached lvl 42 where I repeatedly never got the red balls needed in order to beat the lvl. I've been stuck on this lvl for about a week now, got my hubby playing on his kindle and after a few days he got to this same lvl, the green balls were needed for his and he beat it. I still can't get any other color than the red bow tie. Go figure.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This  is one  the most  open  and  honest  bio concerning a  dedicated  soldier  to his  Country and  the  problems  both with  battle  and killing  and with  the  domestic front.  A Wuss  should not  read  this!
B00CL8D83U|5.0|This PSB record has had me dancing all summer. In all the years of listening to them, this one has been played every day since its release at my house. Its rich production quality,(thank you Stuart Price!-the man is a genius) has created a classic. Indeed, the Boys-Tennant & Lowe have pulled out all of the stops, outdone themselves and all the competition. Now I have to rush out and see them again in Chicago.<br /><br />There is very little political rambling so prevalent on past records. The obvious \\"leftist\\" tilt is present as expected. Yes, they cover Bruce Springsteen The Last to Die. Its perfect! There is also a sensuality here not heard since the 1990s-their largest decade. The tracks can easily be mixed into one big single. Weekend is my favorite track-Example has an effective rap that soars. Vocal starts the party again. In this musical drought, its a sparkling and refreshing drink in every sense.<br /><br />These guys are in their prime and empower the tribe to keep dancing, loving and hoping!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show is so good that it feels like real life. Absolutely amazing, and just keeps getting better as the seasons go on.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is an awesome book. I try to read it when ever I have time. When I finish it I am renting the movie. Best part is I got it as a free download. I would have paid for this book though because it was that good!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a wonderful game. It was challenging and kept my attention. Loved the additional level. Hope they keep adding.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|It took me the first seventeen chapters to really get into the book as I found it rather dull. There were many pointless passages that really had no reason being there. And later when Jo refuses Teddy, I couldn't pick the book up again for about a week. In fact I was so upset, I threw my hard cover copy of the book into a lake. However, those troubles aside, by the end of the book, I realized that everyone ended up with who they were supposed to.<br /><br />I do still think it was rather unsisterly of Amy to steal Jo's man. Even if she refused him, I would never even think of dating one of my sister's ex boyfriends. Amy was definitely my least favorite character because I always thought matter how many times Louisa May Alcott says otherwise, Amy was rather shallow and conceited. Plus, as stated earlier, she stole her sister's man! Jo was my favorite character, as I believe she always worked the hardest, tried her best, and I see a lot of myself in her.<br /><br />Overall, by the end of the book I was extremely satisfied and would recommend it to all in need of a relaxing summer read.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Everyone was reading these books - so the curiosity made me order.  I did enjoy reading, it was not the best writing that I have read.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|So far book is quite realistic. I am midway through second part and its interesting.<br />Characters are well developed and there are some anticipated and some just unexpected abrupt twists.<br />Overall I like the pace and style.. its very timely .. there are morals and no morals!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did enjoy the first book - it was written very elementary so you could breeze through this book very quickly. .
B007THA4FI|2.0|It read like a teenage novel.  It was way too simplistic.  I really didn't like it at all.<br /><br />Jane Gorman

B00A81NFAS|5.0|Very well written movie - I laughed, I cried and I found myself caring about these characters.  I think this is a movie that you either love or hate but I will continue to watch it time and time again.  Best movie I have seen in a while.  I love the dry humor that is displayed throughout.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This worked fine the first couple of times I used it. After that it keeps giving me an error message stating it has to shut down. You're better off just logging on and watching videos from the website, this app has glitches.
B0000CNY27|3.0|Unfortunately I was unable to watch it due to the condition it arrived in.  That doesnt have much to do with the actual movie, though.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|This was an okay movie. It kept my interest, and the boys were good, but I just couldn't buy into the entire premise.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was alright. Somewhat easy till it gets to a level in which you can barely find any clues. Definitley for the older mindset. for patient people as well.

031623480X|5.0|Basically Dr. Perlmutter is telling you to get off grains that contain gluten and explaining the deleterious effects of eating these and other high carb foods like sugar.  I agree with him wholeheartedly on this as I've had my own experience with changing to a low-carb, grain-free diet.  My son, now forty-nine years old, has been battling weight problems since his teens.  He had had a gastric bypass operation a few years ago and lost a lot of weight, but he began to slowly gain it back and was becoming diabetic again.  We knew his health was on the line and he needed to be on a low-carb diet, but he would never have the willpower to do it unless the whole family was on the same diet.  My husband and I were only a few pounds overweight ourselves, but we went on it with him to keep him from ruining his health.<br /><br />Our results were excellent.  My husband loved going back to the weight he was when he was young and being able to keep it that way, as he had been yo-yo dieting for years.  I found that the diet significantly reduced the pain and swelling in my fingers that had been becoming more and more deformed from a rare type of arthritis that I had had since I was in my forties.  I didn't want to believe that grains were the cause, but I couldn't deny it after changing my diet.  I believe that if I had been on this diet since I was in my forties, my fingers wouldn't look like they do now thirty years later.  My son had been diagnosed with osteopenia several years prior to going on the diet and all drug-based attempts to stop its progression had failed.  After being on the low-carb diet for less than a year, his last bone scan showed he no longer has osteopenia.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter has done a good job of further refining the diet that I am on and providing a list of supplements some of which I am not on but plan to start taking so I can get the max benefit from my low-carb diet.  He has plenty of backup research for his assertions, and the recipes are helpful.<br />Further, Dr. Perlmutter shows the connection between a high-carb diet and ADHD, depression, obesity, osteoporosis, diabetes and otheers.<br /><br />I believe this to be a book for inquiring and discerning persons who are interested in having the latest health information or who have been looking for answers for how to overcome the above-mentioned diseases and problems, and who have given up on drugs and now want to take responsibility for their own health.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is very useful and easy to use. Great tool for several of my iPod apps. I recommend this highly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a perfect game for anyone who enjoys puzzles. The game isn't so challenging that you can't complete the puzzles, but it is tough enough to keep you thinking. I just wish there were more levels.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Love the trilogy. Great storyines for the Autobots and Decepticons. I probably watched all three at least 30 times or more.<br />Buy it at a great price. Wish Meagan Fox was in the third one but she was cut and Carly aka Rosie is pointless in the third one. She may be hot but her acting isn't. Pointless. I wish they brought all the bots back from the previous two and Ironhide my fave wasn't killed.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really liked this game. Some stages were really tricky, but in a fun way. Some clues were challenging enough that I had to take notes to refer to later, but that is the kind of thing I love. Maybe not for everyone, though. The music and sound effects were great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched Season's 1 and 2, and now 3, via my Prime account, and have thoroughly enjoyed the show.  What a wonderful way to catch up on 3 seasons in a flash.  Beautiful decor, clothes, fun and interesting story lines...Such a different way of life and a<br />quickly changing world.
0062213423|5.0|Just had to have this for my grand-daughter it is all about the newest and greatest boy band ever.  Just ask her she will tell you.  No this was just what she was looking for.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|Such a happy movie. Makes me smile every time. It's not Christmas time until I've watched this one. Move over &#34;it's a wonderful life&#34;
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's a shame that it was a box office failure and I think I know why.  When I first heard of this movie I had no idea what it was about.  I didn't even know it was a science fiction movie, and I think most other people had no idea either.  When you title a movie or book you should always give the prospective audience an idea of what it's about.  To simply name the movie John Carter gave most people no idea what it was about and I think that was the key to its failure.  Wikipedia said that the director changed the name from John Carter of Mars to just John Carter to appeal to a larger audience, but by making this simple change it appealed to no one.  Only people that had read the book series would know what this is about; and frankly I had never heard of this book series until after I saw the movie.  If they didn't like the title John Carter of Mars, they should have used the title John Carter of Earth and in the closing credits the title would change to John Carter of Mars like it did in the movie.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Kids play games on my device. If you start your game with ads the young ones end up in the &quot;store&quot; instead of the game. App developers need to knock it off.
B009RX85N0|3.0|I was a big fan of Season One of ONCE UPON A TIME and I eagerly anticipated Season 2 on DVD. Season 2 took my by surprise and not in a good way. A fun take on classic fairy tales has become a constant shift of characters and plot lines. ONCE UPON A TIME has put a lot of actors to work as nearly every episode introduces a new character or re-introduces one who has gone missing. The problem is there are so many characters and so many story lines that things are getting beyound silly.<br />The basic theme is good versus evil. Emma, Mary Margarite (Snow White) and David (Prince Charming) have an alliance against Regina (the Evil Queen), Cora (Regina's mother) and Mr. Gold aka the Dark One aka Rumplestiltskin. When good is about to triumph, evil kicks in and the never ending story continues. Back stories keep going on and nothing is linear in time. The modern day was a consistant but that is no longer true as time jumps for the present back 28 years ago.<br />The taking peoples' hearts was over the top this season. Enough of all this! Please!! Tell a story and develop a character and story line. Much to my disppointment a new character with an interesting story appears and is dead in the same episode. Why bother? And the puff of purple magic smoke that is used over and over again by Regina and her mother is used over and over again.<br />There are some great actors in this series but there are so many stories going that it's hard to keep track. Mr. Gold and Regina both try to go \\"good\\" but nothing good lasts.<br />Portals open and \\"humans\\" come to Storybrooke and the city's inhabitants are in danger. To confuse matters more, these fairy tale characters are joined by literary characters such as Hook (as in Captain Hook) and Dr. Frankenstein. Are classic TV show characters next.<br />I was disappointed in Season Two but the season finale caught my interest so no doubt, I will be watching Season 3.

B00710Z87M|4.0|When I first started reading this I had just finished most of Esther and Jerry Hick's books so I was holding this book to kind of the gold standard (and I have read a lot of the Seth books too) but as I got further into this book I realized that the author had a slightly different take on the information and a fresh perspective can be helpful to stalled creating. I also have  come across a couple of very good gems of perspective that I have not heard before and copied them down to remember them later.
1416583432|4.0|Interesting and informatve. You need. To stick with it thoun because there is a lot of research being discussed that is a bit lengthly.

B009Z59ZNE|3.0|Having watched Kevin Spacey's interpretation of Frances I was surprised to find Ian Richardson not as believable or Machiavellian. Also the character of the wife was much more evil in the USA production. Both productions are a must viewing for anybody who is a political junky as I am.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three.  The first was lacking substance but gave the series the benefit of the doubt.  Second book gave me the substance I needed.  The third left me wishing the series had not ended.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this trilogy! Can't put it down! Always on the edge of my seat between the love they have, the break ups and secrets!
B005LAII1C|5.0|A film that is not for the whole family or for all people, but has a very select audience. Probably destined to become a cult film.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a great hidden objects game, once you get the hang of it. You have to play for a while before you really get the gist of it. The game rewards you enough, so you don't have to purchase anything with your own money as long as you know what your doing! The free updates are also a huge plus! It's very addicting, so be prepared to play for a couple hours at a time!

1781162646|4.0|Stephen King is always a joy to read. I've read everything published by him and have been a lifelong fan. I hope he continues putting out work for many years to come. Joyland is a departure from most of his work, but still grabs your attention from the beginning and holds it until the end. It's not his best, but it is still Stephen King, and that has always meant better than most.
0345803485|3.0|It's a subject that attracts many readers as its not been written about often. But it could have been compiled a bit deeper. Characters could have been a bit more complicated. Overall enjoyed reading it.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|It's probably my age and the economy showing, but this was a great movie about people retiring on a very limited income to India.  Each retiree has a story line, and the young owner of this Indian hotel for the elderly has his own story line.  And the story does show how little many countries care about their older folks compared to how they are revered in many Asian cultures such as India.  I loved it.  I've watched it 4 or 5 times since I bought it.  I like India.  So it appeals to me.  I hate to say any more because I don't want to spoil the movie.  But I do like the way these people change and grow as the story progresses.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Sad futuristic film with a lot of gratuitous shooting.  Not much plot intrigue. Glad I didn't pay for the movie in a theater.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Like Bruce said, these movies are rollercoaster rides. Sure they're unbelievable scenarios at times, but what do we want, a documentary? Bruce delivers again, pure action and entertainment.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|That was one of the best books I have ever read it was amazing I never thought a book could be that good I can't wait to read the next one
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|My daughter loves this series and I will continue getting the new books for her, I think is a good choice for kids and help to develop more understanding about how this work in a child's world.
B00498YZFK|3.0|This movie was okay but it had a tendency to drag along kind of slowly. I was hoping for something a little more suspensful than this was.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|not really into video games but you get to fight and kill things. not looking towards. the spider thing but I think this game rocks so far
B003R1B9MW|5.0|This movie is a very relatable, wholesome family movie. It is a joy to watch even if you don't know that much about or really care for golf. It's the classic underdog story.
0985557834|5.0|Great book ,,a must have for people into paracord stuff. You should also buy the first book and have them both in your library.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. It was a quick read. But, I really didnt like the ending. I would still recommend it, as it was cleverly written.
B009O36EO0|5.0|This CD does not disappoint!!  Loreen's vocals shine in every song; and the songs are catchy.  Only criticism is that a few of the songs have a similar rhythm.  While in Madrid this summer the CD was playing everywhere, so I'm sure it's just a matter of time before she's successful in the US.
B0011Z3DK2|5.0|Fantastic classic Led Zeppelin album. Great melodies, riffs, and lyrics. Doesn't disappoint and i am sure you will agree. enjoy!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have read every one of Vince Flynn's book and this one fell somewhere in the middle.  I have liked them all, it is howver tough to read about Mitch getting older.
B0011Z1BSS|4.0|Good Led Zeppelin album but you could tell they were starting to get a little tired as a band. the quality started slipping and they were kind of rehashing Zeppelin trite riffs just in a different way. The fact that the album sounds like a party kind of makes up for that though.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app is amazing. The recipes are soooo goood! And the app looks really good. Very easy to use!<br /><br />The fact that you even have videos makes everything more simple.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game, but I play it way too much, which leads to the hating it part.  It is so addictive.  I have gotten to level 51 without spending a dime, so you don't have to spend money if you spend time.  It is, essentially, a hidden picture game, so if you don't like that type of game, this isn't for you.  However, it has not been updated to add additional social interactions or levels (the iOS version has).
B000FC10IO|5.0|I could not put this series down. If you enjoy fantasy, you will enjoy this. I missed the characters after the series ended.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|Great movie.  A fresh, hip take on a classic.  Visually stunning to go along with a great Tobey Maguire story of his relationship with Gatsby.  Modern music made the movie feel fresh!  Definitely worth a look for those of you wanting to be entertained. Great acting!
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|This mystery seemed to follow the traditional mystery storyline. I had wanted something more out of the ordinary from Nesbo, but this was pretty ordinary.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very useful and functional yet simple and easy to use.  Like being able to use my own music as the alarm. Great app.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|The first, and my favorite, season of Community. Every episode is a classic in it's own way, every character is a comedian in their own right and hilarious on this show. I loaned this one out and never got it back, I might just have to buy it again!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Acting good but the story like was very weak.  Walked away thinking no love/hate towards story.  Was glad that I rented it instead of paying for it at theater
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Since Steven Wilson embarking on a solo career that has liberated him from his band Porcupine Tree's occasional stylistic restrictions, Hemel Hempstead's widely revered prog-rock polymath has been revelling in the genre's limitless possibilities. Emboldened by the presence and powers of bassist Nick Beggs and woodwind maestro Theo Travis, Wilson's third solo album covers a bewildering amount of ground. Based on a series of self-penned ghost stories in the tradition of Edgar Allen Poe and Arthur Machen, The Raven That Refused to Sing explodes into life with a stripped-down art-rock thud before morphing seamlessly into all manner of wildly evocative soundscapes, melodic crescendos and mellotron-drenched fever dreams. Honed to peak fitness by recent touring, Wilson's band whip up an electrifying storm of amorphous vitality, their grasp of light and shade ensuring that something as elaborate and adventurous as The Watchmaker never loses focus or fire. Concluding with the eerie grace of the title track, this album shows Wilson to be one of modern rock's most cunning and soulful protagonists.<br /><br />I think both Classic Rock & Prog Rock have it correct by having this album nominated for album of the year for 2013, and so far this year I think it is!
B002W1UEW4|4.0|to see what i used to read standing in the magazine section of the drugstore is great, special effects were amazing
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|I was all set to sit back this labor day weekend and watch G Q when I found it was gone, ever have one of those movies that you really want to see again? I tried to remember who I let borrow it no luck, I saw this blu-ray the one I had was just a dvd  I really enjoyed this movie, the timing was perfect with cast, they didn't get so far out it got stupid, there was a story line. The crew of the Quest tv show was taken aboard a real star ship to save their world, Enjoy. On your next day off.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|as all star trek its was fun to watch, have seen all of them so far made this one is about in the middle of the pack
1934356557|5.0|This book is by far one of the most important books that I have read regarding SQL in my years as a database professional. Bill Karwin takes you on a journey of common mistakes that are made by SQL developers that can end up costing time, money, or resources. I have always been pretty methodical about which books to read, but this book couldn't have come at a better time for me and my company. Since I am the head of developing an in-house electronic health record system, I wanted to set myself up for the right tools so that it will stand firmly for years to come. I felt that I could not truly do that unless I was aware of the common pitfalls of database programming. This book has taught me not only what the pitfalls were, but why they are not preferable over other solutions. If you are a database programmer and you plan on crafting a solution that involves gigabytes (even terabytes) of data, it would be in your best interest to purchase this book and read it from front to back.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Fantastic edge of your seat thrill from start to finish i watched it twice just to take it all in. I can't wait for the next one
B004I8WLK2|5.0|This is an excellent overview of European political and social history since the second world war.  It places the coll war in Europe in context and the social and economic developments in western Europe.

B00AYB1RGG|3.0|I think all the actors and actresses were not allowed to act.<br />The Villainess was only actress that showed character in the movie.<br />The writer's story and plot were very good, but the directing sucked.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|It was a great movie,,gory,it was true to the classic one.I can't wait for the sequel.Great movie.That's it.Nothing else to be said.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Could not believe I was reading these words.  Read the entire book in one day.  This will blow your mind.
B000S1LUE6|5.0|I recommend this book for everyone! Single or married because we should understand ourselves in order to understand others. A good foundational teaching to reach out and fulfill the command to love one another...
B003ASLJK4|4.0|Clint Eastwood is my favorite actor and one of my favorite directors, and I certainly recognize Meryl Streep for the excellent actress that she is.  That being said, I wouldn't have chosen either of them to star in this movie.  Streep's Francesca comes off as frustrated and grumpy, with an overdone Italian accent that - after living in Iowa for 20 years - sounds like she just got off the boat.  It was hard for me to find her very appealing and to believe that Clint Eastwood's character had genuine feelings for her.  The screenplay veered off from the book in making her a stronger and more independent woman, rather than the naive, swept-off-her-feet farm wife she was in the novel.  This decision was a correct one, but Streep carries it a bit too far.  Likewise, there's a problem for me with Clint Eastwood as the romantic lead, which is that...well, he's Clint Eastwood.  He plays the part with earnestness but it's hard to keep in mind that he's in town to photograph covered bridges, not to track down some killer.<br /><br />This criticism aside, Eastwood did not do a bad job translating this story to the screen, and was able to improve upon the book in a number of ways.  The film is nicely photographed on location and does manage to preserve the tiny universe that these characters inhabit for the brief timeline of the story.<br /><br />Watch for a great tracking shot near the end of the film as Streep's character runs out of the house after a departing Eastwood.  That and the later scene in the rain (which was not in the book) work wonderfully well.<br /><br />I would have casted it differently but it's a good movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series and think it is more than worth the read. Thought provoking..not at all what you might expect.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great read, wonderful pace. I can't wait to dive further into the Shadow World with newly opened eyes. Book two here I come!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book of the trilogy is every bit as good as the other two. Highly recomment the entire series.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Again, hoping for better characters instead of control freaks who have a predictable approach to the other character.  Nothing like 50 Shades of Gray
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a captivating story about people connected through their connection to Afghanistan.  Any one of the individual stories could make a complete book.  I couldn't put the book down.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer knows how to make a movie score and this one is up there. Considering the subject matter its a little difficult to not want to hear the famous theme but here its replaced with a more subtle but just as moving score.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My kids love the Gruffalo book and also this movie.  It follows the book exactly. My 5 year old would watch all day if I let him.
0425252868|5.0|I loved it!  I wish lt could made into a movie!  A true life drama depicting how good moral judgment can triumph even in the heat of battle!  The U-Tube video is a must see!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this series/saga! I actually started getting bummed when I realized the story was coming to an end. I will be purchasing Shift as soon as I get done with this review! Having grown up reading Bradbury and other \\"classic\\" science fiction authors, I am looking forward to reading more from this author!
0143119680|5.0|I saw this book recommended on an online forum.  It is not the sort of genre I usually read and I could see that it has received mixed reviews on here but was determined to make up my own mind.  I loved it. It is a long book but that doesn't bother me as I like a book I can get my teeth into.  I enjoyed the story and the mix of vampires, daemons and witches. There are some engaging characters in it such as Ysabeau, Marcus and Diana's aunts.  I loved the mystery and the slow burning romance between Matthew and Diana. I found Matthew a little cold at first, but as the story develops so does he. I found him extremely magnetic and appealing and was under his spell by the end of the book.  For someone who has never found vampires particularly attractive before, I have definitely lost my heart to Matthew Clairmont.  I am now about the start the second book.
B006BQNJR8|3.0|Sorry this was actually a good movie but I kept having flash backs to Arnold. This was not as good as Arnold's but it was interesting. Better animation.
B0000047CX|5.0|Not as good as Getz / Gilberto 2. A great album, but the live stuff on Getz / Gilberto number two can't be beat.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This made me think about what we are doing when we do things without looking at the consequences. I enjoyed this movie.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I happen to believe in the paleo/ lower carb/ clean unprocessed foods philosophy. I found this book to be an interesting read. It was easy and quick but still gave enough science to support the claims made and make it interesting. I don't know how this book would read to someone new to the topic, but for me it is fun to read more about the different philosophies that basically support what I already believe. Anyway, I liked it and would recommend.
B0084670FU|5.0|This movie was good at building to the climax. It was hard to understand the different pieces until it was all tied together.
B00DL47RQ2|3.0|Much has been made about Cate Blanchett's performance and I am in total accord with the acclaim.  She played \\"Blanche DuBois\\" in \\"Streetcar Names Desire\\" on Broadway and I'm sure that that did a lot to inform and deepen her performance as \\"Jasmine\\" here.  (It's interesting that her last name in \\"Blanchett\\"---maybe these are roles she was born to play?)  At any rate she is wonderful here and in my opinion, she rescued the role from what could have been a two dimensional caricature.<br /><br />Sally Hawlings, too, was very good as her sister, and saved her from being another working class stereotype.  Her various men friends are fun to watch but I'm afraid they do fall into the category of types.  Another reviewer commented that they seem to be more from New Jersey than San Francisco.  Alec Baldwin is the quintessential charming bad guy...maybe another role he was born to play?  The rest of the cast is just fine, too.<br /><br />Cinematography is great, costumes, scenery...all first rate.  The only problem I had with the film was the script.  And that's major.  I don't think Allen decided if this is to be a satire or comedy, a farce or a political comment, a human tragedy or a morality play.  It is engaging, as all of Allen's films are and Blanchett takes the ball and runs with it.  She's so interesting to watch and so beautiful, that the time in the theater flew by until the credits rolled...when I heard people all over the theater say \\"That's it?\\"  Yes, those of us who go to art-house films are supposed to be grown up and not expect \\"Hollywood\\" endings where \\"everything's wrapped up neatly in a bow\\" but still it would have been nice to have some sense of resolution.  It was sort of like a Beethovan symphony where Beethovan forgets to put in the final chords.<br /><br />As for the comparison to \\"Streetcar\\" the difference between Williams and Allen is that Williams loved his characters so  when  Blanche was taken away to the insane asylum the viewer wept.  It was a true tragedy.  As for Jasmine here, I didn't shed any tears. In spite of all that Blanchett did to bring a soul to her she still remains someone I didn't really care about.  It's not her fault and I hope she gets the Oscar nomination she deserves.  Acting students may well want to watch the film for her performance.  For me that's the only reason to see it.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|I don't think this is the best Die Hard, but I still like it a lot.  Great choice for Jack-he played Varro in Spartacus.  Really enjoyed the banter (always do).  Good stuff!

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a fairly quick read and it was hard to put down. I'm still reeling from the ending.  Enjoy!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I think it's an adorable game. Great graphics, great for all ages, and best of all its great for anyone.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|This review reflects the shipped product/whole package and not the film itself. As an avid film watcher, I simply cannot find value in purchasing an incomplete product. And unfortunately, that's what every company is releasing. An incomplete product.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book caught my attention immediately and held it throughout.  I love the story and interesting photos that bring them together. I would definitely recommend this read if you like a little bit of thrill,and have an interest in all things \\"peculiar\\".  I can't wait for the next book
B0089LOKHG|1.0|What a letdown this final book was! I can't believe all the loose ends.  We'll never know what happens. I feel we deserved a better ending after sticking with the series.  The first two books were great. I wish I could get my hours back I spent reading this series. I can't believe there are so many great reviews for this. Huge waste and disappointment...don't think I'll be reading anymore of this author!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's twitter. It does what it's supposed to, and it does it surprisingly well. the new updates were a little buggy, but it works
B009C7JS14|5.0|Great weather app because it's not completely complicated it's nice and simple. If you don't like complicated apps this is the app for you.
B00563M11M|5.0|Always loved Terry Pratchett's work. And even in his darker mood the man still delivers.<br />Absolutely recommend reading this book.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I have been a fan since before anyone knew of John Legend. This is one outstanding recording. Every track is fantastic. What a voice and command of his compositions.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I loved it.<br />As far as I'm concerned Brandon Sanderson is a better writer than Robert Jordan ever was (specially in his later volumes), and I wish he would re-write the whole series.<br />Loved the final take on the characters, who under Sanderson fully bloomed.
B0055V6EZE|3.0|But good enough that I bought the  Did it Rain CD when it came out. I actually like this one better.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this book down, and now I am sad it is over! A true testament to how the course of life can change by a simple change of events.
B00C1S945G|5.0|The characters, the storylines, the struggles, encounters, & difficulties of seemingly impossible situations in space are vividly played out in this excellent representation of the Star Trek continuum.<br /><br />For me the technical aspects of space travel intrigue me and imagining what' s possible is the first step in achieving the things that are out of reach today. I think it's a superb series to watch.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|It is great...so compact, takes up very little room on my shelf. Blu-ray Collection is the way to go !
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A romance series with an actual story line.  Character history and development that doesn't drag you down.  Quick, enjoyable reads.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Its been a long time since I was enthralled with a sci-fi series (Dune was the last) and I must say I'm glad I made the leap. The trials this boy goes through just makes you flip page after page....I recommend this to anyone....well, just anyone.

B003XF1OJK|4.0|Fun little read on the backstory of Master Chief and the Halo Universe.  Some of the plot points in the games make a bit mores sense now.
B002N57KG2|5.0|Very goofy movie now! But when I last saw it I loved it.  Love the one liners and the silly drama!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Flow Free is a fun game and on the surface it looks entertaining and challenging. Until I opened it with my MP3 player going. Even though I turned off sounds for Flow Free it interfered with the music being played (only app I've downloaded so far that does this) and made the quality of my tunes scratchy and distorted.<br /><br />Since my main mode of playing is to listen to my music while I game, this makes Flow Free a non-starter for me.
1423101499|5.0|Book was received in great conditon.  Thank you for having this book available.  Great series.  I hope they make movies out of the rest of the books
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|This is a solid little game and I think the poor reviews seem quite unfair. The concept is very silly but I don't see that as a reason to slam the game. Are games where you drop bombs and destroy whole cities better than one where you're hitting balls in clowns' faces? It's not amazing or particularly original, but it works very well and is fun.
B0034G4P4O|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'The Adventures of Tintin' has been described as a \\"3D motion capture computer-animated epic adventure.\\" Like many Spielberg productions, the story represents a hearkening back to yesteryear. It's similar to Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' series, in that it involves a search for lost treasure, in the spirit of the old radio and movie serials. It also involves the struggle between a clear cut noble protagonist and calculating, villainous antagonist.<br /><br />I never really was able to figure out how old Tintin, the young journalist protagonist, is supposed to be. Somehow probably between 16 and possibly 22. Anyway, the plot is not overly complicated. Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn, at a flea market and it's actually one of three models, that contain a scroll. When pieced together, the three scrolls, reveal the location of sunken treasure.<br /><br />Tintin's model ship is stolen by Sakharine, the antagonist, who later is revealed to be a descendant of Red Rackham, a pirate who attempted to gain possession of the actual 17th century ship, The Unicorn; but he ends up being thwarted by the ship's captain, Sir Francis Haddock, who intentionally sank  The Unicorn, in order to prevent Rackham from taking possession of the treasure on board. It turns out that Haddock's descendant, Captain Haddock, is manning an old freighter, which Sakharine takes over by inducing a mutiny amongst the ship's crew, in order to pilot it to Bagghar, a fictional port city in colonial French Morocco, where he intends to steal the third model ship, from a powerful, well-to-do sheik.<br /><br />Where 'Tintin' really takes off is in the deliriously choreographed 3D motion capture computer-animated sequences. There's a chase involving Silk, a pickpocket, in late 40s (?) or early 50s (?) Brussels, who has stolen Tinton's scroll from Unicorn #1. Then there's another great sequence where Tinton and a drunken Haddock escape the freighter in a lifeboat and eventually make their way to Morocco in a stolen seaplane. If that isn't enough, Sakharine steals the third scroll during an operatic concert for the Sheikh, given by a woman who reminded me of Margaret Dumont (from the Marx Brothers). Finally, there's a great chase scene, where the good guys finally apprehend Sakharine.<br /><br />'Tintin' falls flat in its attempt to be periodically humorous. There are two Scotland Yard detectives, Thompson and Thompson, who are too inept to be funny and then there's Captain Haddock, whose drunk act, proves ultimately tiresome. Tintin himself simply doesn't have enough idiosyncrasies to be a compelling protagonist, and comes across as a generic sleuth. What really kills 'Tintin' in terms of narrative, is the lack of a romantic interest for Tintin or at least some kind of female foil, that could spark things up. Tintin has a lot of action for prepubescent boys, but adults will probably find quite a bit of this stuff, simply juvenile. I recommend Tintin for all the technical wizardry, but the target audience is really best suited for ages eight through twelve!r in a lifeboat and eventually make their way to Morocco in a stolen seaplane. If that isn't enough, Sakharine steals the third scroll during an operatic concert for the Sheikh, given by a woman who reminded me of Margaret Dumont (from the Marx Brothers). Finally, there's a great chase scene, where the good guys finally apprehend Sakharine.<br /><br />'Tintin' falls flat in its attempt to be periodically humorous.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Every time I picked it up, I had a hard time putting it back down.  It took a bit for it to grab me in the beginning, but after that, I was hooked.  I am currently enjoying the second book in the trilogy and am already looking forward to the third.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Once I started playing The Room I lost all track of time.  I'm not a game player, but this is something I want to keep playing.  When I finish this game I will definitely be looking for other similar games to play.  I'm hooked now.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book helps you understand the spiritual language of life. Everyone should read this book. It should be a requirement before you are allowed to read the bible.
B002APU580|4.0|I really enjoy this film and have watched it several times.  My only criticism is that I wish it were a little longer and included a few more scenes that I thought were important in the development of the main characters' relationship.  While faithful to the book, it has fewer scenes and characters so that the film can fit into a 2 hour time slot. For those who are familiar with the book and the BBC version, you can easily fill in the missing scenes.  However, it would have been fun to have them in the movie. Still, I really enjoy this version.  I also recommend the BBC version as well.
B00422LESO|1.0|boring - predictable - not worth the effort, could the movie be any better?  I doubt it and would hate to pay to see it, fortunately the ebook was free
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It is an easy read.  James Bowen has an engaging way of writing his story.
0767020308|4.0|I like this version much better than the one with Gwenyth Paltrow,  This version seems more in keeping with the Austen tradition.
B00622BF40|5.0|I dance ballroom and can appreciate the satire in the movie.  It is an enjoyable move with a great looking male lead.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very refreshing plot! Highly recommended for a quick and wonderful read. I definitely want to know more about this author!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|James Bowen has an engaging style that is easy to read and keeps you interesting.  It really does show that by helping another (animal or person), we often wind up unintentionally helping ourselves in the process.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|j love this game, it is by far the best minecraft-esk game I have ever played!!! must try, must buy!!!
B00CJGP116|3.0|I don't think this is his better work. I really wasn't impressed. I expected something extraordinary like the song &#34;I Want To Know&#34;. To tell you the truth, I was disappointed with this CD.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Words cannot explain how great this movie is. Best money ever spent. If you have not seen this movie just buy it and thank me later.
B008D36INE|2.0|The beginning was so slow I felt like I was going to go to sleep before getting to the end.  I didn't watch the remainder of the movie.
B0017M413M|3.0|I usually love the Stargate movies, but this one was lacking in so many ways it's hard to list them all.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I quit reading King for a few years.  After his accident his books just weren't the same and even he said that he was quitting because he had no new ideas.  He may of had a dry spell but this book has me back reading his novels.  What would you do if you could travel back in time?  What could you do?  The hero of this novel has an idea of what he wants to accomplish but has to learn the rules as he goes.  It's classic King so you can figure some of it out but he throws a few turns and twists you won't see coming.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|Sound is excellent - vocals haunting.  She needs to get out more and quit dating - all the lyrics are pretty down!
B00190N4E4|5.0|This is an incredible movie. Of course the first scene shows what everybody already knows: the assassination. But the story is absorbing and well acted.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I like the stories he tells in his songs. I am transported whenever I listen to his music. He makes the ordinary extraordinary.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Don't know how I missed this one, but better late than never. It's really hilarious in many spots. I loved the two scenes of the teachers trying to get high schoolers to get interested.
B0002S947K|5.0|I had the hardest time finding out who this was. I saw a PBS special on him and loved it.
B00E193TM2|3.0|About half the tracks are good. the song with the duet with Rob Halford would be much better if it had more than 30 seconds of Halford in it.<br /><br />After a few listens, my favorite track is probably their cover of &#34;Mama Said Knock You Out.&#34;
B003QCCS36|5.0|Just about every song on this CD is good. The man has a way with words. I don't understand why we don't hear more of his music on the radio.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was well done. Sandra Bullock's acting is amazing. Get this if you want to watch a wonderful feel-good movie.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|3 1/2<br /><br />The thing about being a fan of Trent Reznor's music is that you're not going to get the same thing over and over again.  In some ways, that's good, in some ways, that can be disappointing.  HESITATION MARKS is a pretty good example of both of those.<br /><br />You can tell what direction Trent is going by his last album.  There was a lot of instrumental soundfield stuff on YEAR ZERO which came right before his two-disc all-instrumental GHOSTS.  His HOW TO DESTROY ANGELS albums went from being a Nine Inch Nails album with a female lead singer (upsetting, as it would have been one of his best had it been released as NIN) to a far more electronic vibe on the HTDA WELCOME OBLIVION and extreme minimalism on his GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO soundtrack.  So, he's obviously interested in minimalism and electronic stuff these days.  No shock then that his new album would have a lot of it.<br /><br />And it does.  Which is great if you take it for what it is and don't expect it to be one of the albums you liked when you were younger.  Assuming there's another NIN album ever again, it will never be THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL, so don't hope for it.<br /><br />Realizing that this album happened because Trent was writing to songs as bonus material for an upcoming \\"Best of Nine Inch Nails\\" and just decided to keep going, the \\"concept album\\" ideas of SPIRAL, YEAR ZERO and to an extent, THE FRAGILE are not here.  He also decided to not censor himself and just release material that wouldn't be popular with his hard rock fans (\\"Everything\\") and change some of his predictable \\"soft verse-screamy chorus-repeat\\" stuff to something more unique (\\"All Time Low\\"), though he still writes lyrics in much the same time signature and key, so some things will never change.<br /><br />The lyrical aspect and artwork hearken back to THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL, but the music itself - especially the wide range of styles - is most reminiscent of THE FRAGILE - an album that took me quite a while to get into, but once I did, I was hooked forever.<br /><br />So, track by track:<br /><br />EATER OF DREAMS:  I totally wish this was three minutes longer.  I love where this is going and I'm upset I couldn't sit with it longer.<br /><br />COPY OF A: Fantastic.  Great opener and a nice mix of PHM and YZ.<br /><br />CAME BACK HAUNTED: I get why this was the first single.  On the one hand, that fuzz bass line is one of the coolest things he's done in years.  On the other, you can sing \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" to this music and it fits perfectly.  Listen to enough NIN and you'll realize for all his ingenuity, Trent writes some pretty simple 4/4 melodies that can sound alike easily.  But this has the exact same chord structure.  That being said, I prefer this to THTF, so........<br /><br />FIND MY WAY: Hearing Trent sing about \\"My Lord\\" in any fashion other than cursing him is strangely upsetting.  Ignoring that, this is a beautiful song.<br /><br />ALL TIME LOW: I love when Trent gets funky.  Along with CLOSER and INTO THE VOID, ALL TIME LOW has that great funk groove.  I'm not a huge fan of how it slowly drifts off into nowhere at the end, but the first 3/4 is great.  Definitely one of the best tracks.<br /><br />DISAPPOINTED:  I love the music and I like the verses, but the chorus doesn't seem to fit here.  Not the lyrics, but the melody.  Like \\"We're In This Together,\\" it doesn't work for me.<br /><br />EVERYTHING: I actually love this song.  Trent has always been as influenced by the Cure and new wave as he has by Bauhaus, and I love how this song defies expectation while holding onto a shadowy chorus.<br /><br />SATELLITE:  Very YEAR ZERO.  Great track, great use of whispers, and of prescient NSA paranoia.<br /><br />VARIOUS METHODS OF ESCAPE: Amazing.  One of my faves.  The music is very THE FRAGILE and I've always been in the camp of \\"the glitchier the better.\\"<br /><br />RUNNING: And here, a song that could have been good if a little more time was spent on it.  If thechorus wasn't so almost comically upbeat, or if it had been used as a pre-chorus instead, maybe.  But it feels too much like a work-in-progress to me.<br /><br />I WOULD FOR YOU:  I have a similar issue with this track.  For some reason, the bass sounds very cheesy to me rather than brooding.  Take that out and this is a classic NIN song.  Slow build, big chorus, the occasional mechanical noise..... nice.<br /><br />IN TWO: Other than the act that the pre-chorus is so cool I would like to have it return again in the song, this may be my favorite.<br /><br />WHILE I'M STILL HERE/BLACK NOISE: Wow.  It's like your typical soft Nine Inch Nails finale with a smooth jazz guitarist and saxophonist.  What?  But it works.  This is why I love Trent Reznor.<br /><br />Like most NIN albums, it'll probably take a few months to make a firm decision, but keeping expectations managed, HESITATION MARKS is a pretty decent listen.chorus wasn't so almost comically upbeat, or if it had been used as a pre-chorus instead, maybe.

B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Unlike Terminator 3, which got rid of Sarah Conner altogether, or the Christian Bale Terminator film (which we shan't speak of), this TV series adds a lot of depth to the Terminator universe, in the same way that the Star Wars Expanded Universe added a great deal of depth and variety to Star Wars beyond the three (only) films. The writers clearly have a love for the films, and went to great lengths to think out the consequences, implications, and mechanics of a war against machines waged in time itself. The only real shame is that this show lasted just two seasons and ended on a massive cliffhanger that, if the show had managed to go one, would have been an amazing experience.
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|This CD is just perfect.  The musical arrangement is pleasing and enjoyable - just put on your headphones, you'll love it.  I recommend this music to anyone who loves progressive rock such as Genesis, Yes...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This was an awesome read. I cannot wait for the winds of winter. It will be interesting to see what becomes of Jon. I have a feeling his watch has ended but also have faith in the red God.
B00338QENI|5.0|very interesting. I had no idea this really happened also it's kind of scary to think this really happened so recently
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very much worth your time!  It has a new concept and story line!  Must watch to find the new twist to this series!
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|I rented this movie because my coworker thought it made him physically ill.  Pretty scary, but in some instances not really believable.
0380789019|3.0|I wanted to like this book because I've enjoyed some other things by this writer. This book wasn't as entertaining to me, mostly because I never really liked the characters or cared much what happened to them.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Didn't think my boyfriend would get into it, but he actually cried at one point.  Bought Season 3 to get caught up.  Can't wait for Sean 4 to start.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|My boyfriend missed Season 1 and he jumped in at Season 2.  He was so into it we ordered Season 3 so we would be caught up for Season 4.  Great!
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|This is a fabulous movie. I've seen it several times and love it each time. Life really is beautiful.  Love it
0375836675|5.0|This book was very interesting.  It starts you out in the middle of this poor kid's life.  He has no direction in his life but is a good person at heart.  Someone, some stranger, see's the potential in him and schemes up a list of challenges for him to find himself through.  Very amusing and interesting - you want to just keep reading to find out why?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great wholesome show! It occupied my interest the entire time. Can't wait for the next season to come out on Amazon Prime.
072325804X|5.0|I gave this book to my newborn niece as a keepsake that she can keep throughout her childhood years & hopefully pass it down to her children. The thick cardboard box sleeve makes it easy to display the book and keep it safe, and the illustrations are absolutely beautiful. It has so many more stories than I remember as a child and is organized nicely.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Good classic movie for any age and any family :-) just one of those movies that's always good to go back too.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so fun. I like all the different cars and there upgrades and very fun space levels. get it for you will have a blast. I know I looks little weird.... ok a lot but it's quite addicting I got my dad hooked on it and this is. Coming from an 10th grader so that is why I rated it five stars but I wish you could change your character. And the really cool thing about this game is that I make you feel like you get tons of coins well you do. It goes by 25 to 100 in the first level and as you get father 500+100+ 25 coins each coin has a number on it. Like 100 that's the coin worth 100 well u knew that. And guess what that coin is not rare at all its one of the most comin coins. Just like the 500 coin will become very comin.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She's a huge muppets fan and loved this movie as a kid. She was super excited to watch it again as an adult.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Great action movie, but the plot wasn't too deep. You know what the outcome was before the movie started. If you are up for a guys movie, Awesome but don't look for a deep wow movie here.
0684847817|4.0|I am a huge Brian Froud fan and I love collecting all his artbooks. This one was unique as it's like a diary of seen faeries. Love the artwork and I love the story portrayed here.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Loved the movie!  So much better than I thought it would be, and the ending was great.  I would rent this over and over just to watch.  Action, plot, actors were great.  I am going to buy this one.  Rent it watch it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Easy to follow and interesting enough to keep you playing for hours. With only a minor glitch that was easily fixed, this game had great graphics and an interesting storyline.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I REALLY have enjoyed this game!  I especially like that you don't have to be connected to the internet to play.
B009KWU6Q2|3.0|This is a good family movie that you never see showing on TV.  So nice to have the disk and watch it from time to time.  No real violence or scares.  Good for young children both boys and girls.
B001DCZ4IW|1.0|This video had scenes cut from it.  I have seen the movie several times and this copy was compromised.  Very disappointed
B00457WZEI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. This is almost better than the movie. I would recommend this wonderful book to anyone who is looking for a story of strength and pride.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was like no book I've ever read. I finished it it one day (I had a hard time putting it down!) and couldn't be happier I did it. I cried and cried uncontrollably throughout the book as I faced a harsh reality. My life is forever changed.
B006AN78XS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I loved everything about it.  The cast, (especially Kathy Bates)  the story EVERYTHING.
1847940323|4.0|This was a well written book that had applications in both my personal life and in the business world. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it was a bit repetitive.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is like the most awesome app ever and it's free  I love free things and I am only reviewing this for the coins to get a hint lol
B009XHAM8G|5.0|My mother used to read this book to me as a child and it was my favorite!<br />I now read this book to all 3 of my children every night!
B00CTT9646|4.0|I know people have said that this movie is a rehash of TWOK  and I think in some ways it is. Actually, no, let me rephrase that. It's a twist on a favorite character but told in a new way. I actually thought this was better then [[ASIN:B001AVCFK6 Star Trek (Three-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]] and I understand why it was subtitled Into Darkness. Having said that, I think the Shatner cameo would have worked better then Nimoy's this time around but because Shatner said no to cameo's........<br /><br />  I actually like the reversal twist of the radiation chamber scene. I didn't see it coming but story wise it makes sense and it also shows the writers knowledge of Trek lore. I hope they all come back because I can't wait to see where they will take the crew next.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br />-------<br />In case none of you noticed. Amazon is getting what none of the retailers are getting which is the DVD with a phaser replica. FYI Paramount isn't the only one that does this. This is standard practice with all studios. Why? Contracts and deals. Retailers pay the studios for exclusive content which means that legally, other retailers aren't allowed to receive those DVD's with all that stuff. Amazon gets many exclusives that no one else can get. I admit this is a half assed way of releasing a DVD but look at it this way, with the popularity of Blu Ray, extra features are no longer on regular DVD's. Those are now bare bones and no one complains about that. :)
B00D4ABW82|5.0|This is what i initially wrote w/ 2 stars:<br /><br />\\"Understanding what we've Grown to Be was amazing.  Not happy at all with the direction they went in with this one.  There are decent melodies in the first few tracks but the rest of the album is unmemorable, very weak.  There is no drive, no musical complexity; very generic. They really dropped the ball with this album.\\"<br /><br />I haven't changed the title.  I just wanted to show how wrongly I had judged this album. Over six months I continued listening and really began to absorb the profound messages; Lyrically inspiring, Musically upliifting.  I am very much in love with this album and would recommend it to anyone.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I got this the day it came out. I uninstalled Asphalt 7 and replaced it with this and this is so much better then 7. It's harder yet challenging. I love the stunts that you get to do. The graphics are great and no lag whatsoever. I am playing this on a [[ASIN:B00C7BVCAM Sony Xperia Z C6602 Unlocked Phone with 5 inch HD Display and 1.5GHz Quad-Core Processor--U.S. Warranty (Purple)]] I even got to spend time with Gameloft when they did a Q&A and learned so much about what can be done in the game. I paid the $0.99 in the Play store for this which is very generous since the last one was $2.99.  All in all, if you are a fan of racing games, I highly recommend this one. One of the best mobile ones out there. Hours of fun and entertainment to boot. I even tried the multiplayer version and there';s little to no lag at all and lots of fun as well. I found it a bit harder then single player but the learning curve for it take s a bit of getting used to. yes there's in app purchasing but it's not necessary to further into the game. Just unlock with stars and you'll do fine.
B0000256KE|5.0|God, I remember hearing this album for the first time and just being completely and utterly swept away by the sound. It would be days before I really listened to the lyrics and we played the damned thing all the time. This was a formative musical experience for me and still holds a special place in my heart akin to the one held by my first real girlfriend.<br /><br />Less experimental, more studio-production-heavy, Ferry has found his voice and doesn't muck about with it like he did on \\"Roxy Music\\". The songwriting is talking itself more seriously too; no more lines about planting potatoes.<br /><br />Themes? Lessee:<br /><br />\\"Do The Strand\\": There's revolution in the air and it is Dance-Related! A staple of the progressive dance clubs of the winter of 1972/73, it drops names and makes in-jokes and lists a floor-full of dances, all unsuitable when compared to the eponymous Strand. I have no idea how to do the Strand. There are no instructions in the song or on the cover. Driven by Paul Thompsons drumming and Andy MacKay's demented Saxophone and some really under-rated bass work.<br /><br />\\"Beauty Queen\\": Ferry is quitting on her and her chosen vocation. Not one of my favourites. Possibly because the reverbed to heck-and-back electric piano makes me feel seasick.<br /><br />\\"Editions of You\\": Another dance club staple, and a rocker that features a shrieking synth break by Eno. I was one of those who thought firing him was madness on the strength of what he did here and on \\"Ladytron\\" but Eno ended up laughing all the way to the bank and more power to his elbow.<br /><br />\\"In Every Dream Home A Heartache\\": A love song to an inflatable partner. Ferry did it years before the Police did, and did it better in my opinion. Shocked my daughter, which made it new again after forty mumble years. Heh heh heh. Still part of the stage shows when they tour, so I hear. Almost as a separate track there's a coda, phased into the stratosphere, which worked to end what was side one on the old vinyl LP quite effectively.<br /><br />\\"The Bogus Man\\": Is great for dancing to as it has a primal, pounding beat courtesy of Mr Paul Thompson with some nice bass work while Manzanera, mixed *way* back is working with his Telecaster and a Revox set up as an echo machine (didn't have no digital sound processors in them days, no siree, and the best way to pull the echo trick was a Revox reel to reel tape recorder because you didn't get the \\"click\\" a tape loop Echoplex machine made). The song ends leaving no-one in any doubt about what has *really* been going on for the last ten minutes - which got everyone a bollocking if the parents heard that bit.<br /><br />\\"Grey Lagoons\\" is my favourite song from this album I think. Clever and witty and it features a wonderful double harmonica solo worked across the stereo channels for best effect. Ferry works his voice a bit here too, and this is perhaps an echo of the fun he had with it on the debut album and maybe why I like it so much.<br /><br />\\"For Your Pleasure\\": A slow song with a distinctive beat and a lyric with a point. The band are talking to the listener, but maybe that isn't you.<br /><br />Overall the songs on this album are strong and not at all in the mould Ferry would adopt from Manifesto on, increasingly preferring the layered texture overdub over song complexity. While I like both approaches, this one is the better and richer experience.<br /><br />The production is high, but not overdone and each instrument can be heard clearly and at its best advantage, including Ferry's voice which was more constrained here but still something he would push and pull to make something marvelous.<br /><br />The cover is a simple gatefold with the famous Limo, Girl, Panther and Brian as Chauffeur picture on the front and a panorama of the group against a white background inside (heavily retouched). You can almost see it in the CD release.<br /><br />Recommended.on the old vinyl LP quite effectively.<br /><br />\\"The Bogus Man\\": Is great for dancing to as it has a primal, pounding beat courtesy of Mr Paul Thompson with some nice bass work while Manzanera, mixed *way* back is working with his Telecaster and a Revox set up as an echo machine (didn't have no digital sound processors in them days, no siree, and the best way to pull the echo trick was a Revox reel to reel tape recorder because you didn't get the \\"click\\" a tape loop Echoplex machine made).

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|One of the best I've seen.  Bring along a box of kleenex (this isn't a commercial so bring any tissue in the house.)  Acting, special effects, true story line...all outstanding.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! It is in a class of it's own. Huge imagination, excitement and action! Such a creative and original story. I loved this movie SO much that I bought the John Carter Barsoon Series on Kindle to read it and find out what happens next! The ending of the movie leaves so much excitement out there and you want MORE! To know what happens next! Great movie! Fun to see over and over again!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007SOWADQ John Carter: Barsoom Series (7 Novels) A Princess of Mars; Gods of Mars; Warlord of Mars; Thuvia, Maid of Mars; Chessmen of Mars; Master Mind of Mars; Fighting Man of Mars COMPLETE WITH ILLUSTRATIONS]]
B001R6AW18|5.0|I have seen this film many times.  I live in NJ and my grandson was visiting from Seattle Wa. so I brought him to see the sights in NY.  When we visited the Empire State Bldg.  He wanted in the worst way to see the film.  I rented King Kong and he enjoyed it so much it made me feel like I was seeing it for the first time..
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I would give this a big fat ZERO but that was not an option  this is a total waste of an app
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Thhis story of that Alan, the 100-year-old man truly is like Forest Gump with a cane.  loved this outrageous story full of quirky characters and situations that could never really happen.  It was a delightful romp of a read that resembles the journey Alan falls into when he walks away from the nursing home and becomes embroiled in all kinds of madcap trouble.  As the story proceeds the reader is treated to flashbacks that fill in the details of Alan's earlier life and eventually you find out just how he came to be in that nursing home in the first place.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I read the book since I don't yet have Netflix but I'd heard so much about the series.  I have a pretty vivid imagination but the descriptions didn't grab me or make me laugh or really move me.  I just found it easy to read but I wouldn't recommend the book but I'd still like to watch the series on Netflix.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I loved this game before I updated and lost everything I had. Even stuff I bought. This is ridiculous and better get fixed.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I recommend it to all<br />I woke up on time keep on sleep mode when use does not drain battery
B004HWYTP4|4.0|A bunch of old actors really are good. Very action packed and funny. Movie is worth the time and money.
031623480X|4.0|I know, I know, it seems like a diet book comes out every few minutes that promises to revolutionize the way we think about food.  I'm as skeptical as anyone about the \\"latest study\\" that demonizes some type of food or the latest fad that celebrates another...<br /><br />That being said, this book really did make me think.<br /><br />I wouldn't have considered reading a book called Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth About Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar--Your Brain's Silent Killers, if not for two things.  The first: A friend of mine went on a wheat-free diet and lost 80, yes EIGHTY pounds, in a little over a year.  The second: Inspired by my friend, I read The Mood Cure by Julia Ross, followed the regimen she describes in her book (including going wheat-free) and experienced immediate and almost total relief from the generalized anxiety disorder that I have suffered from for 20 years.<br /><br />So, to be fair, before I even read Grain Brain, I already suspected that wheat, and specifically gluten, can be problematic for *some* people.  But EVERYONE?  And accusing wheat of causing or at least contributing to all kinds of health problems, from ADHD to Alzheimers?  Sorry but it seemed pretty far-fetched.<br /><br />I mean, bread is the staff of life, right?  And it's also sooooooo delicious.<br /><br />According to the author, Dr. David Perlmutter, there is a good reason why we find bread and other gluten-laden foods so lovely and so hard to give up.  Gluten, a \\"sticky protein\\" that holds bread dough together as it rises and makes pizza dough stretchy and chewy is causing our brain to experience a \\"sensorial high.\\"  It triggers the same pleasure response that opiate drugs activate, giving us warm, fuzzy feelings and bringing us back for more!<br /><br />Unfortunately, Dr. Perlmutter claims, it also causes our blood sugar to spike even more than white sugar, triggers inflammation throughout the body by increasing harmful cytokines, and contributes to a host of brain-related problems, whether you have the typical digestive distress of celiac disease or not.<br /><br />I have to admit, this is a pretty darn big claim, and even though I personally experienced benefits from going wheat-free, I was hesitant to believe that gluten is so harmful for all of us.  Like everyone in my generation, I was taught that wheat and other grains should be the foundation of our diet, followed by vegetables, fruits, meat, and very sparing amounts of fat.<br /><br />But Dr. Perlmutter's approachable, easy-to-understand style finally succeeded in convincing me.  There are end notes after most (but not all) of his premises, to point you towards either a study or a source for that claim.  It's helpful to learn that fat isn't as evil and dangerous as we've been taught, as long as we enjoy the right kinds of fat.  And it's very reassuring to find out that our DNA doesn't determine our future 100%, and that making changes in our diet can have lasting positive effects on our brains as we age.  It's nice to know that we do have some control over our destiny, if we just avoid things that are harmful to our brains.<br /><br />Part I makes a lot of claims about various foods and other substances (including cholesterol) and how they affect your brain's health.  Part II is more of a call to action and outlines the habits that promote the best brain health.  Part III, the last 30 pages or so, are recipes--can't vouch for those since I haven't tried them yet, but I can say that living without wheat does take some adjusting but it becomes second nature after a point and it is possible to live without bread and not miss it.  Much.<br /><br />The only advice in the book that I plan to completely ignore is the limit on fruit (due to its sugar/carbohydrate content, and explained in more detail in the chapter on antioxidants.)  I already gave up my bread--my brain will just have to tolerate my love of fruit salads, smoothies, peaches and cream, and apples-with-peanut-butter.  Allthings in moderation, right?<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving the book 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did wish for a few more notes confirming or at least backing up certain claims.  Phrases like \\"increasing numbers of studies have shown\\" or \\"all the latest science\\" should be backed up by sources.  In most cases, they were, but not every time.<br /><br />By the way I have not read Wheat Belly, which Dr. Perlmutter quotes several times, but I'm adding it to my reading list.  At this point, my copy of Grain Brain is so highlighted and underlined, I won't be able to lend it to anyone, so I'm planning to buy it for my mother and recommend it to my friends.  You'll have to read it and decide for yourself.  Better yet, read it, then try his suggestions, and see if you feel better.  I bet you will.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|All I can say is ooopha.. This movie was the epitome of stupid. You would think it would be decent, but no. What was worse is this movie was more expensive than the others. Dont waste your time (2 hrs 15 minuts) or your money.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|When I heard \\"Black Rain\\" on Youtube, I thought, \\"Keane is BACK!\\"<br /><br />Having ardently loved the albums \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and \\"Under the Iron Sea,\\" I was somewhat less interested in \\"Perfect Symmetry\\"--although not completely so.  I found its songs to be more... agitated, replacing that melancholic piano of Keane's I love so much with more hairy electric guitar and abrasive synthesizers.  [Compare \\"Love is the End\\" (yes!) to \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything\\" (eh).]  Still, I like Perfect Symmetry's songs; not my favorite, but they cater to a different mood.  However, when I heard \\"Stop for a Minute,\\" I was crestfallen.  I personally do not like interludes of rapping with lines like \\"And baby you are just beautiful from crown to your cuticles\\" (blech), especially mixed with my cuppa Keane, and none of the other songs on \\"Night Train\\" appealed to me, so I did not purchase it.  Did my love for Keane end at \\"Love is the End\\"?  [/cheesy]<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"Strangeland\\" is, to me, a return to Somewhere Only We Know and Under the Iron Sea.  It's better than Perfect Symmetry, and much better than Night Train.  Strangeland carries the torch of Keane's wistful, earthbound dream of a sound onward but is still distinctive in my mind from the former two favorites. As another reviewer said, I do not want to skip any of the songs on this album--which is saying a lot. Highly recommend :)
0345803485|5.0|I had been warned this book was porn.  And I suppose to some extent it is. However, it is extremely well written. A very good story along with the sex.  I've read all 3 in the series.
0385528787|5.0|MaddAddam by Margaret Atwood is the third and final part of Atwood's dystopian speculative fiction series that began with Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood. While Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood took place during the same time period, MaddAddam continues the story on from the point the first two novels left off. MaddAddam is being released on September 3rd.<br /><br />Having read the first two novels, I would encourage everyone to read them first before proceeding on to MaddAddam, however several reviewers feel MaddAddam can stand on its own merit. (Okay, let's be honest, anything Margaret Atwood writes can stand on its own merit.) There is a review of what happened in the first two novels at the beginning of MaddAddam that neatly summarizes the narrative in Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood, leading up to the current action.<br /><br />The story of Jimmy, the Crakes, Toby, Zeb, Ren, and Amanda are all continued. This future depicts a society that has been wiped-out by a plague created by Crake. In the backstory we know that before the waterless flood, corporations ruled. Gene splicing and genetic alterations were common. Now human beings as we know them are almost all wiped out and the genetically altered wildlife and plant life flourish. I'm unsure about how much of the story to tell because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who is planning to read all three books. If you look at today's headlines, though, Atwood's speculated outcome doesn't seem far-fetched at all.<br /><br />Can I just say \\"Wow!\\"and \\"Bravo!\\" In MaddAddam Atwood did an astounding job continuing her story telling, mythology-making, and world building until they reached a credible conclusion. Yes, the big themes are heavy, cautionary, and serious and there are many profound statements and observations:<br />\\"But hatred and viciousness are addictive. You can get high on them. Once you've had a little, you start shaking if you don't get more.\\" (Location 323-324)<br />\\"Perfection exacts a price, but it's the imperfect who pay it.\\"( Location 719)<br /><br />But there are also many humorous, lighthearted moments. Take these two exchanges between Toby and the Crakes:<br /><br />\\"I am doing this thing with my hands on my forehead because I have a headache. A headache is when there is a pain in your head.<br />Thank you. I am sure purring would help. But it would also help if you would stop asking so many questions.<br />Yes, I think Amanda must have a headache too.\\" (Location 1486-1489)<br /><br />\\"Stupid means things Crake didn't like. There were a lot of things Crake thought were stupid.<br />Yes, good, kind Crake. I will stop telling this story if you sing.<br />Because it makes me forget what I am telling.<br />Thank you.<br />So then Adam's father...\\" (Location 1815-1819)<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended - one of the best.<br /><br />Disclosure: My Kindle edition was courtesy of Random House via Edelweiss for review purposes. However, it should also be noted that while I'm thrilled to have received a review copy, I per-ordered my own personal copy of MaddAddam.erfection exacts a price, but it's the imperfect who pay it.\\"( Location 719)<br /><br />But there are also many humorous, lighthearted moments.

B005R32L66|1.0|I have not figured out how to use it on my phone and I purchased it to be able to communicate with my son who is deployed.<br />I am not a dummy but there are no directions on how to access Skype on the phone it keeps asking for a password for microsoft and I don't have one.
B00E1LAS42|5.0|I'm not sure why the critics did not like this movie much, because I thought it was, by far, the most faithful rendition of this novel put on film (I am a huge F. Scott Fitzgerald fan, and I feel pretty confident he would have loved this interpretation, too).  Leonardo DiCaprio did a spot-on job of portraying Gatsby as Fitzgerald penned him, and I thought that was true of just about every other character as well; special kudos to Ms. Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan.  The glitz, ritz & glam that Baz L. dazzles with is EXACTLY the atmosphere Fitzgerald was trying to convey in the novel.  Loved it - the music, the costumes, the sets - all fabulous!
0515142247|5.0|I cannot complain about this series. My husband loves it and I have to keep buying it now that I started.
B00DDU1T5E|1.0|DOES NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS APP. YOU CANNOT WATCH ANY VIDEO'S WITH THIS APP AT ALL.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Thrilling, good remake of a classic. Left me wanting more action. I recommend to watch this movie. If not once but more
B00AOCLWF6|3.0|If you can get past the cliched characters and problems said characters face being wrapped up in a nice ribbon by the end of each episode. Then you can enjoy this decent sci fi show about aliens attempting to concur the earth and a small band of humans trying to stop them. Would recommend it if you have nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|The party scenes would have been more enjoyable in this movie had they been more correct to the period. I would watch it again.
0553801473|4.0|Can't wait for the next one left me handing when does the next book come out cant wait muck longer
B005LJK3AC|5.0|This movie ranks right up there with 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up as one of the best comedies of all time.
0345803485|1.0|I found this book in a pile to be thrown away, so I read it knowing nothing about it. I got about halfway through, and decided to continue to the end because something interesting must happen. But no, it was just more perverted sex - one can only take so much. Give it a miss - there's plenty of good books out there.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|great series very enjoyable - good photography, writing and acting.  frustrated season 3 is not available for purchase.right now. thats it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Please dear God, do not overanalyze the movie.  You know its good.  Just buy it if you find it for the right price.
B00536OCZA|5.0|What can I say? I am really into post-rock, ambient, and shoe-gaze.. most bands from this time period can't hold a bit of my interest.. but &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34; was just so well done, upon every listening I am pulled in by the gravity of it.. and there the darkness is apparent for all to see and to experience. Extremely satisfied with the quality of this package.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app is very intuitive to use. The images and descriptions are great, what makes it good for understand the recipes
B004XZR63M|3.0|This was a very educational book that allowed me, as a teenager, to understand it. Thus is they key to a smart life. With financial intelligence comes financial independence. Amen!
B00846WWVM|5.0|It was a surprise. I really like to play this game. The graphics are good, and the gender of the game the same
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great way to carry a bible without the actual wait of one and I can take it everywhere with me which is so good.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|with this app, i can simulate all the painting i did when i was a child. I can choose from a very complete set of pencils, markers or crayons. And is good for childrens to paint, and save several versions of the paintings that they done
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the games that I can play for hours and not get bored with it because there are so many obstacles. It is very fun.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I used to play this game for pc/mac, and now is good to play it on android. The graphics are good, and it's good to use it. Its easy to play
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its really Really addicting once you get a hang of the controls.  Its fun to play and good when you have time to kill ans even  when you dont.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|My second read of this series.... absolutely love it. I love the idea of having it with me, on my phone & tablet.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I read in the NY Times the other day that this book won the Hugo, and the description piqued my interest. I downloaded a sample, liked it, and bought the kindle edition immediately. I tore through it faster than any book in recent memory, sometimes embarrassingly laughing aloud in company. The rest of my family has to take turns with it now!
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Not long after my son loaded this game my Kindle was telling me it had a Virus.  So I deleted it from the Kindle.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A great little app, I use it frequently.  Its well priced and performs a needed service.  I liked it enough to purchase it and I don't purchase many apps.
B00821OX98|5.0|The first episode of the season just grabbed me and drew me in. From the premise of the series, an invasion of earth and those fighting to keep it. To the amount of information given to the audience each week, feeling in the blanks of who these invaders are. You start to form a bond with the survivors early. The visuals used in the series are top notch also.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|A thriller with a number of our favorite cartoon heroes .  The film is packed with action, you will not be disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just ordered the DVD to add to my collection of Downton Abbey. I have already seen Season 3 and the many surprises at the end leaves us all waiting  for Season 4 to start. Wonderful actors throughout the series. This will be enjoyed again an again.
006114665X|5.0|Dr. Clarke has written, in my opinion, a very detailed and readable adventure about the features, circumstances, chronologies, personalities, governments, so on and so forth of the human infrastructure that resulted in WWI. There is a splendid thread in these reviews by ReasonableGuy with comments et al that convinced me to give this read a go.<br /><br />I am about up to a dozen words or so that I lack in my vocabulary. RATIOCINATIONS!  Very Cool. This at about 40% through the read.<br /><br />Anyway I need to sleep.  Will update this after I finish the book.
B00DF92E7U|5.0|What a great surprise to hear Stills, Goldberg and  Shepherd playing such an inspired set. The musicianship is first rate and Stills particularly songs as good as he ever has. A little Blues, a lot of rock and just a solid set from some veteran rockers. A first rate effort!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Let me start by saying I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was indeed a thrilling read with many twists, turns, surprises and intrigue. That said, it also irritated the hell out of me! The characters could be hard to empathize with for sure. The style, though very unique in format, could get on your nerves a bit too. It was very clever and never dull and it kept me on my toes but the ending - although in retrospect I have to say how else could it have ended - really disappointed me. I would still read it again though - great, suspenseful read.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It's a fantastic calculator. It's the only one I use anymore. Handy,accurate, does all the basic functions.<br />I got the add free version for one dollar &amp; I couldn't be happier.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Terrific show, exciting and intriguing. High class and real quality. Sorry when this series ends. We need more TV like this!
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Still as much fun to watch as it was in the 80's.  Great concept to wall off Manhattan.  Russell is great as Snake Plissken.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The music is pleasant. The game is relaxing. The story is fun. Not much else to say. I like it.
0061537969|5.0|Not High Art, but engrossing nonetheless. A fun read inspite of some dark passages. Whether you want to accept that we will all come back after dying as someone or something else, it is easy to see it for the books characters. The pace is quick and because the story is so original, to me at least, it is easy to get into and difficult to leave  before the last page is read.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This gentle movie concerns a man, Alvin Straight, who needs to mend fences with his estranged brother.  Since he can't drive, he takes off on his lawn mower.  That's the main plot, but the subplot is about recognizing that there's a time to but grievances behind you and remember that family is more important than hurt feelings or disagreements and that you can often help people by just saying the right words at the right time and then leaving it alone.  Alvin changes lives all through his trip and regains his independence at the same time.  If you like shoot-em-ups, thrillers, or mile a minute action, you might want to look elsewhere, but if you like a slower pace with a message, give this a try.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This is a fun game, goes quite fast.  I haven't done it with the timer yet but intend to to see if I can beat the clock, so to say.  I have a different mahjong tile game which is a little harder.  This one is still loads of fun.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game with no advertisements and just great fun. Very relevant upgrades not confusing at all. Touch and and go type gameplay.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Great book with so many helpful & actionable ideas for improving health & changing our bodies. I love Ferriss' stories and his willingness to try anything, no matter how extreme. His curiosity & inquisitiveness are the reasons I love his books.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|...But still no ending !  The book has a lot of suspense, but Oliver should have provided a true ending after dragging readers through nearly 1600 pages of story, ugh.
B001XUIBNO|1.0|What a waste of two hours! This movie goes on and on and round and round. What a terrible who done it. Kept watching hoping it would get better because of all the good reviews. Well, I want my money back except that I saw it for free. Yuck is all I can say. Spare yourself of this drawn out thing some call a &#34;great movie&#34;.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Well, to be honest this game was a pick from my granddaughter. She has played the game before and wanted me to see it. I have now played the game and it is cute and pretty easy to follow. Some games I will admit are not as easy to follow for the older generation......So to all the game makers out there keep designing them for all ages you'll surely get more business.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|Some good history revealed that I did not know. Would recommend this movie. Where would they have been with the brother?
B008KRBTU0|5.0|Great version for the first and second graders.  This version does not have pictures that young children do not have a ready name for so it is perfect for them.  Love the different versions of play.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|For the price this is a very nice sharpener to keep in your tacklebox or hunting backpack.  Adding a honing steel that flips out the other end would make this the perfect tool!
0812979656|3.0|This book weaves together many themes in an incredibly artistic way. We're treated to an intense glimpse into a very different culture, which highlights the universality of human nature in all its beauty and ugliness. Unfortunately, the book is nearly ruined by the terrible e-rendering of the text. It was obviously scanned and OCR'd without any checking. There are literally hundreds of typos, particularly when the font is italics. With Arundhati Roy's creative wordplay, it's sometimes hard to tell if it's her writing or yet another typo. On no less than 4 occassions, the protagonist's name, Rahel, appeared as Rand. Deciphering such mistakes is tedious and interrupts the wonderful flow of Roy's writing. Kindle should be embarrassed at selling such a piece of crap; I'm sure Arundhati Roy would be horrified at the poor quality.<br />Five stars for the book.<br />One star for Kindle.
B001IYVUEW|5.0|I think that this was a great origin story.  Christian Bale is my Batman!!  Michael Caine is a great as Alfred.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Cute game me and my two year old love it! He even had his gma playing it :)  Kind of annoying though trying to get coins for new cars but it's better then having to pay money, and teaches him if you want something you need to keep working for it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was hesitant but I read several reviews starting 'not my kind of book but...' so I gave it a try, I was looking for a leisure book anyway. Unfortunately, I am half way of book 1 and this is my best effort. This is honestly one of the few times that I regretted spending money on a book.<br />I doubt human psychology is as simple as the main characters in the book. Ana never heard of Christian before but is basically going all the way mostly because of his pretty face and body. Without feeling the characters real, they seemed to act and talk empty just so that the game can keep go on throughout the book. With unreal characters, I  kept having a huge question mark \\"?\\" in my head, and all the detailed description about Christian office or car or house, the negotiation about the contract, I found it unbearably tedious. I admit that I am not a fiction reader and this is not a story that I would enjoy but I had no problem understanding which I find with similar subject, a korean movie 'Bad Guy'2002 or french movie 'the piano teacher' 2001 based on the novel by Elfriede Jelinek. The characters are complicated but more real life which turns the story more plausible. I might try once more to finish it since I already paid for the whole trilogy but for now book 1 half way is my best effort and I am done! I really tried to finish it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cute game!  very repeatative, but I love trying to beat my friends on facebook and how the costumes change throughout the seasons.

B0067Q42BY|1.0|The ads are distasteful, something you might expect from a free app but not paid.<br /><br />This is also another recycled FAOTD and while many of you hate that we complain about that keep in mind that this year Amazon has been recycling FAsOTD quite a bit.<br /><br />It is understood that new users are getting the chance to obtain these apps but if this keeps up even you guys will start seeing them recycled and will understand how some of us feel.<br /><br />Amazon must be running out of apps, at least decent ones.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I normally love anything by Johm Grisham. This missed the mark. The plot dragged and was predictable. It wasn't typical Grisham.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great company to deal with.  Best keyboard out there bar none. It does everything is says it will do and it does it very well.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is amazing. You get a ton of play time, with multiple playthroughs offering slightly different plots and experiences. It's really emotionally intense, and the plot, challenges and characters are all really good. It is a little scary, but nothing too horrible in my opinion. It sucked me in for hours on my first play, and I still pick it up multiple times a week. I would really recommend it to anyone who likes plot-based, mature games with a lot of intellectual challenges and interesting, deep characters. It's now one of my favorites.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new updated version is not nearly as easy to use and user-friendly as the old version. I really wish they had at least kept an option for a &quot;classic view&quot; .... the new version is an overly flashy headache to use.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Finally ....there is an ongoing HO / achievement based game for the Kindle. I play a number of these types of games on FB and enjoy checking in each day and receiving a bonus for doing so. The feeling of working toward a goal and progression through the levels is quite satisfying and keeps me coming back. Yes you CAN spend real money but, depending on your patience it's not required. Game has many quests and puzzles to keep you entertained and the energy etc. etc. refill over time even if you are not actively IN the game ...niiiice. Plays beautifully on my Kindle and clearly professionally done graphics and interface. Has a nice zoom feature but,  I can't imagine playing this on a tiny phone screen as it seems about at the limit for a tablet but, I have old eyes .....maybe not. No doubt I will still be playing this in a year if they keep adding updates. Nice work guys!!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I own an [[ASIN:B006VFS4J2 LG 60PA6500 60-Inch 1080p 600Hz Plasma HDTV]] which I am satisfied with.  It has no 3D capability, but the 2D images and colors rock completely.  Anyway, I hooked it to my [[ASIN:B00DR0PDNE Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player]] with little effort as my flat screen has easy access USB and HDMI ports adjacent to one another on the perimeter (you don't need USB capability; you can skip the USB port and plug Chromecast into an electrical outlet if you wish).  So often I go to Hulu and learn my favorite shows, including news and entertainment, are not licensed for the big screen.  No more!  I stream beautiful images from my computer to my 60 inch screen effortlessly.  It is a great workaround strategy that allows me to view art and entertainment films I would not otherwise be able to enjoy without peering into my 11\\" computer screen or my iPhone (yes, I can stream from my iPhone, YouTube included :).  Only two reservations: 1. I must agree to allow Chromecast to collect information about my computer searches; however, if this is not an issue for you, Chromecast may just be your next gadget. 2. Occasionally lip movements lag behind spoken words.  I find stopping the show, getting out of Chrome then opening Chrome to the show again resets this.  I am not sure yet how it will sound with my surround system as I have not yet hooked the two up.  Otherwise, completely pleased.  Bravo!

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|If Dylan released Self Portrait in the hopes of shedding his fanbase, could you logically conclude that the pieces he purposely left out would be &#34;the good stuff?&#34;<br /><br />This was my ultimate hope before receiving this album: that the songs on the cutting room floor would be far superior to the original release for the simple reason that Dylan WANTED Self Portrait to be bad. I do not believe this to be the case, and I'm happy about that.<br /><br />Another Self Portrait serves a much higher purpose than merely releasing some &#34;lost gems&#34;: it serves as a lens through which to view several of the most misunderstood years of Dylan's career. Whereas to the listener there seemed to be a clear demarcation between Self Portrait and New Morning, Another Self Portrait illustrates the connectedness between songs from each. These weren't wholly separate projects, but related works. The difference between them is less about the quality and more about the mindset of the artist at the time of their respective releases.<br /><br />So in a way, Another Self Portrait is more than 35 songs: it's 71 new songs. Because I now hear those two original records in a whole new way. History has made a big deal of Greil Marcus's question &#34;what is this shit?&#34; But it's telling that he posed it as a question and not a declarative &#34;this is a piece of shit.&#34; He didn't know then and we barely know now. But Another Self Portrait does a better job of explaining on two discs than any doctoral-dissertation-length history of Dylan's 1970 ever would.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is one of the best romances I've read in a long time!<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br />When Kaleb Krychek was first introduced in the series, I knew there was something about him that was different--despite being billed as a cold blooded killer, he kept doing things that were heroic--like saving Sophia's life (Bonds of Justice) and finding the missing bodies of the victims killed by a serial killer. So I was over the moon when I realized that he had his own story!<br />Some people might be disturbed by his pragmatism (okay, so it does border on the cold blooded), but that only made his reaction to Sahara all the more intense. I think I fell in love with Kaleb when, after the bombing in Geneva, he makes the announcement on the PsyNet, declaring Pure Psy outlaws...very powerful, very sexy...in my opinion, this has to be one of the best novels by Nalini Singh...it certainly jumped to the top of my favorites list!<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good romance...FANTASTIC READ!!
140006922X|1.0|Book Review of, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,\\" by Reza Aslan.<br /><br />Zealot is the first book about the historical Jesus Christ to rank number one on the NY Times bestseller list. This is most unfortunate in that Reza Aslan is not a recognized New Testament scholar. But worse, it is riddled with factual errors, or at least views not widely accepted by the academic community. The book is sometimes confusing, not always well written, and too often does not distinguish between facts and hypotheses.<br /><br />My first clue that this was not a scholarly work was on page xxvii in the preface. He dates the Gospel of John to 100-120 CE. Most scholars believe the Gospel of John was written in first century CE. The mouthpiece of the Catholic Church, the Catholic Encyclopedia, dates John's gospel to around 96-99 CE, the first not the second century. On the same page he writes, \\"Matthew and Luke also relied on what must have been an early and fairly well distributed collection of Jesus's sayings that scholars have termed Q (German for Quelle or `source'). Although we no longer have any physical copies of this document we can infer its content by comparing those verses that Matthew and Luke share in common but that do not appear in Mark.\\"<br /><br />Austin Farrer, Michael Goulder, and Mark Goodacre have argued against Q, maintaining Mark was the first gospel written and claiming the use of Matthew by Luke. This view has come to be known as the Farrer hypothesis. Farrer, in his 1955 paper which first outlined this hypothesis, notes that when two documents are found which contain common material, identical in the words and phrases they use to describe some scenes, the simplest explanation is that one of the two used the other as a source, rather than both using a third document as a source. Goulder points to common Matthean phrases such as \\"brood of vipers who,\\" \\"make fruit,\\" and \\"cast into the fire,\\" which each appear in Luke only once, in a Q passage. Goulder's conclusion, based on writing styles, is that Matthew is the actual source for these \\"Q\\" sayings. Goodacre notes that there is no extant copy of Q and that no early church writer makes an unambiguous reference to a document resembling the Q that modern scholars have reconstructed from the common material in Luke and Matthew. It is worth noting that there is no manuscript of Q in existence. No one has yet found even a fragment of Q. On pages 105, 111, 175, and 190, Aslan refers to Q as source material. I repeat, there is no extant copy of Q, not even a fragment.<br /><br />On page xxviii Aslan writes, \\"crucifixion was a punishment that Rome reserved almost exclusively for the crime of sedition...The Gospels claim that on either side of Jesus hung men who in Greek are called lestai, a word often rendered into English as `thieves' but which actually means `bandits' and was the most common Roman designation for an insurrectionist or rebel.\\" Both the King James Version (KJV) of the New Testament and the Vulgate (the Latin bible used in the Catholic Church) state that the men crucified with Jesus were thieves. That is what I was taught in Catholic school and during Bible readings at Sunday Holy Mass. How could both sources (the KJV and the Vulgate) get it wrong? There were times when Romans ran out of pine wood needed for crucifixions. They would not have wasted it on thieves. It is far more likely thieves would have been beheaded. I believe that the story of Jesus being crucified with common thieves was made up by the authors. It seems to me, Jesus was more likely to be crucified alone to make a clear example of what happens to people who claim to be a king. The king of the Jews was Herod Antipas, who was appointed king by the Roman government.<br /><br />On page 100 Aslan writes, \\"It is the high priest Caiaphas who will become the main instigator of the plot to execute Jesus precisely because he was a threat to the [priests'] authority.\\" Aslan sounds like the anti-Semitic Mel Gibson. Aslan should have read Nostra Aetate, the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions, issued by the Second Vatican Council and approved in October 1965 under the aegis of Pope Paul VI. It states that even though some Jewish authorities and those who followed them may have called for Jesus' death, the blame for this cannot be against those Jews present at that time, nor can the Jews in our time be held as guilty, thus repudiating an indiscriminate charge of Jewish deicide. There are various hypotheses as to why Jesus was crucified. I like the one which blames Antipas. He had the motive (he, not Jesus, was the real King of the Jews) and the opportunity (his relationship with Pontius Pilate made having Jesus crucified no more than a simple text message to Pilate, or whatever they used to communicate back then).<br /><br />On page 138, Aslan asserts that the Jewish religion is 5,000 years old. The oldest known non-biblical reference to the early Israelites is the Merneptah Stele. It is the first documented instance of the name Israel in the historical record and its only mention in Ancient Egypt. If the Jewish faith began with the expulsion of the Hyksos out of Egypt in the 16th century BCE, then Hebrewism is no more than 3,500 years old. Five thousand years ago would put the origin of Jewish faith to one thousand years before the time of Abraham, the time of Noah and the Ark.  The Hebrew Bible is not considered to be a valid source for events back that far back in history. Actually, there is no evidence that Noah and Abraham ever even existed. Aslan reminds me of the moon-walking astronaut James Irwin, who spent the last 20 years of his life searching for Noah's Ark. What a waste of time and energy.<br /><br />On page 262, Aslan  says, \\"Moses saw the burning bush on Mount Sinai when in fact it appeared to him on Mount Horeb, which, despite some arguments to the contrary, was not the same place as Sinai (Exodus 3:1).\\" The Hebrew Bible is not a valid source and scholars debate whether Sinai and Horeb are the same place. Some say yes, others no. The Jewish Encyclopedia says, \\"The Rabbis consider `Sinai' and `Horeb' to be two names of the same mountain, which had besides three other names.\\" Aslan should separate fact from opinion.<br /><br />On page 172, Aslan writes, \\"it was, the Gospels say, the sixth hour of the day-three o'clock in the afternoon-on the day before the Sabbath when Jesus of Nazareth breathing his last... At the ninth hour, Jesus suddenly cried out, `my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'\\" How could Jesus cry out at the ninth hour if he breathed his last at the sixth hour? According to Scripture, Jesus came back to life on the third day, not three hours after he breathed his last.<br /><br />On page 177, Aslan writes, \\"Jesus's is body was stolen? How so, when Matthew has conveniently placed armed guards at his tomb-guards who saw for themselves the risen Jesus but who were bribed by the priests to say the disciples had stolen the body from under their noses?\\" Here we go again, Aslan blaming the Jews. He is arguing that Jewish priests bribed Roman guards to contradict the \\"Jesus has ridden\\" story which was making the rounds.<br /><br />Finally on page 60, Aslan describes the mass suicide at the fortress Masada by the Sicarii (Jewish zealots) in 74 CE. He writes, \\"This speech [by the Sicarii leader Eleazar] had its desired effect. As the Romans prepared for their final assault on Masada, the rebels drew lots among them to decide the order in which they would proceed with their gruesome plan. They then pulled out their daggers...and began to kill their wives and their children, before turning the knives upon each other. The last 10 men chose one among them to kill the remaining nine. The final man set the entire palace ablaze. Then he killed himself.\\" This story was likely embellished by Flavius Josephus, the noted first century Jewish historian. It is not acceptedas historic. In The Credibility of Josephus, Shaye Cohen, the Jewish historian currently teaching at Harvard University, writes \\"We do not know what happened on the summit of Masada on the fifteenth of Xanthicus in 74 CE. The archaeological discoveries of Professor Yadin show that Masada was besieged by the Romans in the fashion described by Josephus, but they do not tell us how the defenders of Masada were killed. For this and for all the other details of Masada's history, we are dependent upon Josephus alone...We know that Josephus' account is false. Silva did not order a premature withdrawal, Eleazar did not have an opportunity for two magnificent orations, the Jews did not have a long evening for the leisurely slaughter of their wives and children, the deliberate collection of all their possessions in one pile and the methodical murder of all the remaining men. This scenario is implausible, contradicted by the archaeological discoveries, and motivated in part by Josephus' polemical and literary concerns.\\"<br /><br />Conclusion: Aslan wrote an interesting book and it provides a brief summary of the life of the historical Jesus, as best as historians can tell. But it is not ready for prime time or the classroom. A reader really interested in the life of the historical Jesus would do far better reading any one of the numerous volumes written by Bart Ehrman (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), Elaine Pagels (Princeton University) or Paula Fredriksen (Boston University). These academics are true experts in the historical Jesus and the New Testament. Ehrman has read all of the gospels in their original language, Koine Greek. He would know best whether the story of Jesus being crucified with common thieves is a misperception and why. Ehrman teaches that the Bible isn't consistent. He discovered the inconsistencies grew exponentially as he traced translations through the centuries. There are some 5,700 known ancient Greek manuscripts which are the basis of modern versions of the New Testament. Scholars have uncovered 400,000 textual variants (differences) in those texts. \\"Put it this way: There are more variances among our manuscripts than there are words in the New Testament,\\" Ehrman lectures his students. How could Aslan write a book about Jesus and Greek translations of the manuscripts without consulting Ehrman? There is not one reference to Ehrman, Pagels or Fredriksen in the text or in the footnotes of Aslan's book. Perhaps his book would have been more historically accurate if he had reviewed their vast body of work and knowledge.<br /><br />The most important question about the historical Jesus is, \\"Why was Jesus the only messiah to become a source of a religion?\\" For believers the answer is quite simple. Jesus is god and/or the son of god. For nonbelievers, the answer is not simple. Aslan describes a variety of messiahs both before and after Jesus. But none, save for Jesus, either was the basis for a major religion or even remembered after his death. Were it not for biblical historians, we would never know about the other messiahs.<br /><br />On page 215, Aslan writes, \\"Paul's conception of Christianity may have been anathema before 70 C.E. But afterward, his notion of a wholly new religion free from the authority of the Temple that no longer existed, unburdened by a law that no longer mattered, and divorced from a Judaism that had become a pariah was enthusiastically embraced by converts throughout the Roman Empire... Christianity after the destruction of Jerusalem was almost exclusively a gentile religion; it needed a gentile theology. And that is precisely what Paul provided. The choice between James's [James the Just, brother or half-brother of Jesus] vision of the Jewish religion anchored in the Law of Moses and derived from a Jewish nationalist who fought against Rome, and Paul's vision of a Roman religion that divorced itself from Jewish provincialism and required nothing for salvation save belief in Christ, was not a difficult one for the second and third generation of Jesus's followers to make.\\"<br /><br />Aslan argues that Roman gentiles comprised the majority of Christians in the immediate generations after Jesus. Somehow Aslan suggests that the Romans abandoned their pantheon of Roman gods and replaced them with a singular human being who was the son of god, god almighty, or both. I find this implausible. If the Romans needed a man-god, there was Julius Caesar, who was decreed god by the Roman Senate in 42 BCE. In 27 BCE, Octavian, aka Caesar Augustus, the adoptive son of Caesar, assumed the title of Divi Filius (son of a god). Why did Romans believe Jesus was god or the son of god instead of Julius Caesar or Caesar Augustus? According to Marvin Meyer, deceased professor of religious studies at Chapman University, the Gnostics believed Jesus taught that we can all become sons (or daughters) of god. Certainly the Jews would have never accepted Jesus as god since the Jewish tradition has no belief in a human being who is also god. That would be considered both blasphemous as well as polytheistic. There are no major religions today, except Christianity, which believe that a human being, now or in the past, is god or the son of god. I think Aslan would have served his readers far better had he spent his entire book researching this all-important question. Sadly, after reading this book, I know little more about the historical Jesus Christ than before.<br /><br />G.R. Pafumi<br />Author, Is Our Vision of God Obsolete?

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Recommended to me by a friend. Loved it, although i like the sequel a bit more.<br /><br />I love the story because its a bit of a mystery and the main character Kvothe is as curious and impatient as I am.<br /><br />Kvothe is sometimes a bit too arrogant for my taste, but the supporting characters are great. I love Denna.<br /><br />Its well written (minus the melodramatic last paragraph of each chapter). Sometimes, the interludes are a bit awkward or obvious, as Basts questions cover up any story holes.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read! Which is why I give it 5 stars.

0399162097|4.0|We are all completely beside ourselves<br />Karen Joy Fowler<br />Trade Paperback<br />Publisher: A Marian Wood Book/Putnam<br />Publication Date: May 30, 2013<br />ISBN-13: 978-0399162091<br />320 pages<br />Uncorrected Proof - Advance Reader's Copy<br /><br />  Karen Joy Fowler writes some of the oddest fiction I've ever read. And when I say odd I mean brilliant in a slanted, quirky way. When she writes a nostalgic scene you will think of your childhood home, your grandparents, and those you loved, laughed, and played with when you were growing up. When she wants you to laugh at yourself or teases your sensibilities you will find the humor hidden in all the little crevices of humanity. When she holds up the mirror of sentiment and emotion you will see yourself in her story.<br /><br />  We are all completely beside ourselves is a story of love, family, devotion, separation, and the dichotomy of life and the biased memories we make in our own minds concerning our pasts. But more than that it's a story of social interaction and how we act, react, and interact through emotionally stressful and confusing times.<br /><br />  One undeserved criticism Fowler sometimes receives is that her characters are unfinished, furtive, and difficult to connect to. Many of her characters are mysteriously, and I think, intentionally, incomplete and here's why I think it's the perfect approach to creating a superior character, especially in the emotionally-driven narratives Fowler creates. Humans are enigmatic and unknown even to themselves sometimes. We are flawed, we are duplicitous, and we are opinionated and often change our attitudes. We occasionally don't know our own minds or the real reasons we say or act the way we do. We are hurtful yet full of kindness. We are truthful but lie to preserve our own slanted images of ourselves and we confuse emotions with obsessions. Karen Joy Fowler's characters then, mirror the gaps and holes in us all. In essence she writes enormously realistic characters that remind us of our own strengths, failings, assets, and ambiguities. Simply put, she writes convincing characters as compassionate, flawed, emotional human beings.<br /><br />  This is the second novel by Karen Joy Fowler I've reviewed. I gave the first, Sarah Canary, a high overall review rating for originality, style, and content. We are all completely beside ourselves is no less creative than Sarah Canary and is, in my opinion, a superior read well worth the time.<br /><br />  File with: mysteries, animal rights, emotionally-driven narratives, the human condition, love, loneliness, and social interaction.<br /><br />4 ½ out of 5 Stars<br /><br />The Alternative<br />Southeast Wisconsintic characters that remind us of our own strengths, failings, assets, and ambiguities.

I even spammed the save and made sure the little box that says \\"file saved\\" came up every time.

Then after my last saves, I closed out so I could open it in dropbox and print it, and it wasn't in dropbox. No biggy... until I went back to reopen and save it in dropbox. Guess what?

This is the product I have been looking for. I may even get another.<br /><br />A few things things consider:<br />-Use is limited if you plan on using an Android alone; however, you can use services that have not been wrapped into Android apps if you push from the Chrome browser (video chat, music streaming, and video streaming).<br />-When using the Chrome Browser, there will be no adjustment for your TV's resolution<br />-Changes in volume have a noticeable lag<br />-Be careful not to crush the device against a wall when moving furniture into place

0061733199|5.0|Good campcraft instructions accompanied by clear illustrations. Color illustrations and/or photos of edible and dangerous plants, as well as dangerous reptiles/insects, are excellent--the best of several books I own.<br /><br />What impressed me the most about this book was its practical, non-drama tone. It's not a panicked manual for the end of the world next Thursday, and it doesn't try to sell you the Waterpurolatorification 3000 Deluxe. There are plenty of situations that I am *unlikely* to be in (&#34;Any Climate&#34; is in the title, but not really in my life), but those situations weren't described in an OMIGOSH YOU NEED TO BE READY FOR THE SHARKOCALYPSE manner. Car campers and hard-core preppers alike will find useful information and enjoyment in this book.

B00D2BHO44|5.0|Video games have grown up.  If you've played The Last of Us, you know what I mean.  This is a seismic shift in the way games are designed and presented, and a revolution in the way interactive stories are told.  This is art, at its most cutting edge.  And with it comes a soundtrack that is just as artistic, soulful, gut-wrenching, and stunning as the game for which it provides an aural accompaniment.<br /><br />In the current console generation, video game music has become almost as good as film music in terms of production value and &#34;cinematic-ness.&#34;  In a game as high profile as TLOU, you might expect something grandiose, with the seemingly-ubiquitous soprano choir and blaring brass sections.  You'd be wrong.  This soundtrack is a study in understatement, subtlety, and restraint.  It's almost painful how tentative the music can be, which I found to mirror the game itself, in the way the characters slowly grow as people alongside the ever-tightening tension and stakes.<br /><br />Most of the music is simple, consisting of a masterfully strummed guitar and ominous, distant percussion.  There are little electronic touches that make it feel like something modern, but not so much that it overshadows the simplicity.  Again, everything is restraint.  There are some hauntingly beautiful pieces here, too, that stir the soul.  If you've played the game, these pieces will evoke scenes from the game that are incredibly powerful, terrifying, or gorgeous.  One of the things I love about soundtracks is how a particular piece, or even just a strain, will catapult your mind back to the emotions you felt when you first experienced the film or game.  This soundtrack does that on every track.  It's riveting.  Be careful where you listen to it, because it might just evoke a few more emotions than you'd want to show in public.<br /><br />This album would be great even if it wasn't for a game I loved.  It works well as a deep, thoughtful ambient album, and I often use it at work as just that.  It relaxes me and reminds me that there are things more important than the drudgery we go through every day--namely, the people we share the ride with.  Not unlike the lessons Joel and Ellie learn in TLOU.<br /><br />Video games have grown up, folks, no matter what the blowhards in the media say.  And this is a soundtrack that proves it.as just that.

B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|When Trent Reznor embarked on his \\"Wave Goodbye\\" tour four years ago, many fans wondered if the mastermind behind such landmark albums as \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" (1989) \\"The Downward Spiral\\"(1994) \\"The Fragile,\\" (1999) and \\"Year  Zero\\" (2007) was retiring the name Nine Inch Nails for good. While NIN was inactive at the dawn of the second decade of the twenty-first century, the same could not be said for Reznor. 2010 saw Reznor form How to Destroy Angels with longtime collaborator Atticus Ross and wife Mariqueen Maandig who thus far have released two EPs and an excellent debut album this year with \\"Welcome Oblivion\\" (2013). Reznor and Ross also received accolades, awards and award nomination for their film scores \\"The Social Network\\" (2010) and \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" (2011).<br /><br />While NIN fans have no doubt enjoyed these projects, Trent Reznor's best work has always been with his flagship project Nine Inch Nails and fans no doubt longed for a new NIN album. Reznor's fans rejoiced and it came as a bit of a shock when Reznor announced earlier this year that he had been recording a new Nine Inch Nails album in secret. With the aid of such gifted musicians as Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and King Crinson's Adrian Belew, Nine Inch Nails are back with the triumphant \\"Hesitation Marks\\" (2013) the first NIN album since \\"The Slip\\" (2008).<br /><br />\\"Wave goodbye,\\" \\"I am free\\" Reznor sings joyfully on the album's seventh track \\"Everything,\\" which tells us that Trent is definitely not the same man that he was in 1994 or even 2005, and has indeed  become \\"something else.\\" A married father, clean and sober, productive and positive, the Trent Reznor of 2013 is not the frustrated, tortured artist that he's always been known as. Still, Trent is still Trent, just an older, wiser, more mature Trent. Reznor has stated that he had \\"The Downward Spiral\\" in mind when he was working on \\"Hesitation Marks,\\" as he stated in a New York Times interview:<br /><br />\\"I felt very aware that it's 20 years later, and I'm still that guy. I know that guy, and I feel for him. I don't resent him, I don't miss him. But how would things feel on the other side of that now, in a much more stable life place, mentally and physically, and with a new family?\\"<br /><br />While I don't see the new album sounding a lot like the 1994 masterpiece, it is a sort of sequel. The theme of the album is about how Reznor came out \\"on the other side.\\" As Reznor has stated to SPIN, the album addresses who Trent \\"was then\\" and who Trent is now and \\"how things have turned out, for better or worse\\" for the tortured protagonist of \\"The Downward Spiral.\\" Stylistically the album sounds like a cross between the spawning, epic \\"The Fragile\\" and the more electronic-leaning \\"Year Zero,\\" and \\"Welcome Oblivion,\\" and sounds, as Reznor has stated \\"sparse\\" and \\"minimal.\\"<br /><br />The album opens with the tense, unnerving and disjointed instrumental \\"The Eater of Dreams\\" which leads perfectly into \\"Copy of A\\" which was released a few weeks prior the album. \\"Copy of A\\" is reminiscent of \\"Survivalism\\" from \\"Year Zero\\" but is a little more subdued, but is no less urgent.  \\"Came Back Haunted,\\" the album's first single was released at the beginning of the summer and is one of Nine Inch Nails best songs to date. The dark, throbbing, restless disco beat, the alarming synths and glorious heavenly chorus make this song a true NIN classic. The contemplative, solemn \\"Find My Way,\\" is in the same style of \\"The Great Below\\" and \\"Something I Can Never Have,\\" but unlike those songs is somewhat more hopeful and while melancholy, not hopeless. One of the album's true highlights is the funky \\"All Time Low,\\" which encompasses an element of `70s soul and sees Reznor hitting an unusually high register at times. The pre-chorus sounds somewhat like the one from \\"March of the Pigs,\\" but more is restrained.  I absolutely love the spacey, new-age outro.  The forlorn \\"Disappointed\\" is very basic and allof the sounds and effects really grab hold of you. The song's use of violin and the erhu (a stringed Chinese instrument that most people are unfamiliar with) is mesmerizing.<br /><br />The next two songs were originally written for a proposed \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. \\"Everything\\" has had a mixed reaction from fans. It's easily the most overtly pop-sounding song that Reznor has written for Nine Inch Nails since the pre-\\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" tracks \\"Maybe Just Once\\" and \\"Purest Feeling.\\" Some fans have noted that \\"Everything\\" sounds a bit like the Cure or New Order and that seems like a fair comparison. I personally love it and think that it could potentially be a cross-over hit. It wouldn't be hard to imagine hearing the danceable \\"Satellite\\" at a club. It sounds a little like \\"God Given\\" from \\"Year Zero.\\" The best moment of \\"Satellite\\" is the grand finale, which slowly builds up and sounds akin to the very underrated \\"Sunspots\\" from \\"With Teeth\\" (2005) and \\"La Mer\\" from \\"The Fragile.\\" The beautiful \\"Various Methods of Escape\\" is one of the most melodic songs that Reznor has ever written. The rather bizarre, avant-garde \\"Running\\" may not get a lot of airplay, but it's accessible and really cool.<br /><br />The lush, mellisonant \\"I Would for You\\" (not a Jane's Addiction cover) is one of the strongest songs on \\"Hesitation Marks\\" and is (along with \\"All Time Low\\") a top-ten NIN song for me. It sounds somewhat like the excellent \\"In this Twilight\\" from \\"Year Zero.\\" It's one of those songs that you may find yourself singing in the shower/office/car/bus/supermarket, etc.  \\"In Two\\" is what \\"Head Down\\" may have sounded like if it had been on \\"Year Zero\\" instead of \\"The Slip.\\" It's somewhat left-of-center with a vast array of sounds. Parts of the song have Reznor singing in a very high register (as he does in \\"All Time Low\\") and other parts of the song can only be described as \\"Cybermen rock.\\" It's a great track that may take more than one listen for one to fully appreciate. \\"Hesitation Marks\\" winds down with the contemplative \\"While I'm Still Here,\\" which, with its horns, sounds a little like the title track from \\"Purest Feeling.\\" The song's theme of overcoming obstacles and making the most out of a finite life can be seen as a microcosm for the album overall. \\"Black Noise\\" begins as a continuation of \\"While I'm Still Here\\" and sees \\"Hesitation Marks\\" ends on a chaotic, yet satisfying note.<br /><br />The deluxe edition comes with three bonus tracks; \\"Find My Way\\" (Oneohtrix Point Never Remix), \\"All Time Low\\" (Todd Rundgren Remix) and \\"While I'm Still Here\\" (Breyer P-Orridge 'Howler' Remix). If you've enjoyed NIN remixes in the past, you're likely to enjoy these too, but they aren't really essential.<br /><br />Twenty, ten or even five years ago, it's hard to imagine that Trent Reznor would make an album as optimistic as \\"Hesitation Marks.\\" It's great to see Reznor happy, in a good space and able to channel all of that positive energy into a new Nine Inch Nails album. Reznor doesn't have to be miserable to make a great NIN album, as \\"Hesitation Marks\\" proves.of the sounds and effects really grab hold of you.

B00B8ED7OS|5.0|As a heterosexual man I would never has chosen to read this book if it were not for the recommendation from a friend. As expected from a book of this genre, there are scenes of gay erotica and while they held no interest for me I still recognize them as being well written passages. However, the paranormal or supernatural concepts in this book I found very original and intriguing. There are some great examples of alternative vampires, an interesting play on the zombie elements and  overall intriguing monster concepts. There are some nice cloak and dagger aspects which involve a secret parliament which the main characters, Julian and Siris, are regretful to be aligned with yet unable to shake off their association. Monster: Book One is a well paced paranormal adventure which I am glad to have discovered and I eagerly look forward to reading Book Two.
B002MGGM9I|5.0|Richard Kelly's 2001 film, Donnie Darko, has both an impressive cast list and a thought-provoking story. Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze star in the movie.<br />Initially, the picture appears to be a simple, offbeat sci-fi flick. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Donnie Darko, seems to be a slightly disturbed yet average teenager surviving high school in the suburbs. He visits a therapist regularly because of his persistent sleepwalking, yet everything else in his life is as average as can be. Donnie's life changes when a man in a giant rabbit suit, Frank, visits him at midnight and lures him outside. His interference saves Donnie's life and launches him into a bizarre adventure. Donnie's mental health decreases as hallucinations plague him while he seems to gain superhuman abilities as well. He encounters Frank repeatedly, and the giant rabbit helps him realize his destiny.<br />However, Donnie Darko, refuses to be labeled under one genre. It boasts elements of romance, mystery, horror, drama, and comedy while acting as a relevant social commentary.<br />Rebuking simplified views of morality and emotion, this film promotes free-thinking. It satirizes the black and white ideology that so many education systems shamelessly promote. Rather than ranking all experiences on the \\"fear or love\\" scale, Donnie claims that humanity cannot be boxed into neat categories and that there are seldom blanket answers for any problems.<br />Kelly masterfully crafted the atmosphere of the movie and its significance to the storyline. The movie left me feeling constantly wary, hairs standing up on the back of my neck. It horrified me in a way that most traditional scary movies could never hope to. There were no spectacular special effects or any monsters to speak of, but it hammered uneasiness into my mind. Whether it was during a sunny day or the witching hour, I couldn't shake the overwhelming feeling that something was out of place and that was terrifying for me. It was like an entire film taking place in Uncanny Valley.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal's acting fits flawlessly into the movie's atmosphere as well. He appropriately balances emotional expression, the awkwardness of a high-schooler, and defiance against repression.<br />The romance in Donnie Darko transcends the stereotypical Nicholas Sparks formula. It's quirky, adorably awkward, and it highlights a vital aspect of romance that usually comes off as cliché and melodramatic- sacrifice.<br />Donnie Darko is not a film for people craving action-filled scenes and a light plot. It is not a leisurely swim for the brain. Its style and depth are reminiscent of other great thoughtful works, such as Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange. Truly, though, Donnie Darko is a rare film that I believe anyone can enjoy if they watch it with the right mindset. Similarly, anyone watching it in the mood for a fluffy timewaster will be sorely disappointed.<br />It is a complex and intuitive piece that refuses to hold back its blows at society's conceptions of good and evil. Even within the serious context of its message, Donnie Darko supplies plenty of laughs and holds its place as one of the most influentially entertaining movies of the 2000s.

B002W7H3EA|5.0|I decided to rewatch this for the first time since I saw it in the theater more than fifty years ago.  It has stood the test of time very well.  It has the classic Hitchcock tropes - the innocent man thrust into mortal peril, the femme fatale with a gradually revealed back story, the cliff-hanging (literally in this case) finale, the cameo of the rotund director.  All of this embodied in the suavity of Cary Grant and the cool beauty of Eva Marie Saint, and shot in spectacular locales, makes for welcome entertainment.<br /><br />The transfer to hi-def TV was gorgeous, much better than I expected.  The Amazon servers and my high-speed Comcast internet connection provided uninterrupted viewing from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|It was a &#34;good deed&#34; done by Amazon to send me this charger; however, IT DID NOT WORK ON MY 7&#34; KINDLE FIRE ANYWAY!<br />The original Kindle Fire is a dud!  Worked for about 1.5 years and that's it.  I did go ahead with the new 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire and so far, it is wonderful.

B00355L2TU|5.0|I have owned several workout videos that weren't very effective, but this one will challenge you and start showing results within a week or so of daily use. Her formula of strength followed by brief, high-intensity cardio tires your arms and core, and leaves you sweaty right away. Following others' comments, I mixed it up -- occasionally alternating levels 1,2,& 3 according to whim instead of doing 10 days at Level 1 before moving up. Only parts of Level 3 are harder than 1 or 2, but not all. The variation keeps things from getting too stale.

B005LAIIN0|2.0|World War Z lacks the grit and \\"bite\\" required for its type of genre outing.  Despite its emphasis on zombism as a pathogen, its infected are just a little bit too refined, and inhumane.  The film is usually looking at them from 3000 feet, literally and metaphorically, which detaches the audience from the horror of the scenario.  The characters are also pretty flat.  Brad Pitt is a patriarch, and his wife and daughters are vulnerable.  Everyone else is a bureaucrat, a soldier, or a refugee.  The film intends to serve some kind of National Geographic version of zombie horror film making and loses story in the process.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|If you've grown up white, suburban, middle-ish class, and always wondered how you might fare if sent to prison, this book might provide the insight you've always wanted. Though it should be remembered she spent the majority of her time in a \\"minimum\\" security prison camp. No picnic for sure, of course, but not Alcatraz either. And she does get a taste of the real thing toward the end of her lock up.<br /><br />I saw the Netflix series first, and loved it. Which is why I had to read the book and find out more about Piper Kerman. But after a reading a few chapters of the book, I had to accept that the TV show really was only \\"loosely\\" based on Kerman's real life experiences. Still though, even as a male, I see a lot of myself in Piper Kerman, and really, that's what totally grabbed my interest.
B005LAII4E|2.0|I absolutely love the original G.I. Joe movie, so I was expecting this to be even better.  Unfortunately, this one was really bad.  A couple big names, a couple of the players from the first movie, and then a terribly confusing story line (what there was of it).  The special effects were good but the rest of the movie was just bad.  Think B movie bad.  Cheesy.  The characters were not likeable.  Overall I was extremely disappointed.  Worth seeing on tv for free, but I definitely would not pay money for it.
1846147581|5.0|Even though this book does not live up to the Guns, Germs, and Steel standard, it is a valuable description of primitive societies from an academic standpoint and from personal experience.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|All the twists and turns among the characters keeps me coming back for more.  I will continue to buy each season as it comes out.
B0095P31L6|5.0|This one made me to want to write my first Amazon review.<br />Just great.<br /><br />P.S. Not for children, but for your inner child.
0553801473|4.0|Not finished with this book yet, but it has not failed to keep my interest so far.  I could not keep my nose out of my kindle over the holiday weekend.
B003VANOFY|5.0|this headset easily beat out my expensive top of the line turtle beeches. the 7.1 surround sound is stupendous with appropriate  media DESIGNED for surround sound. easy to use and clean. very comfy, a little on the heavy side though. software with this headset is amazing, the voice changer is fun. the g keys are very convenient. all around great headset and an absolute steal for the price.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|My writing coach insisted I get this book. I put it off because I am not a fan of the horror genre. However, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Mr. King starts with a loosely written autobiography that takes you through his early years trying to learn to be a writer. It is both funny and sad, but you learn that he didn't become a famous author by simply sitting down one day and writing.<br /><br />The discussions of the craft of writing were more helpful than I could imagine. I think anyone contemplating writing either just for fun or a living should absolutely read this book.
B0089LOG02|4.0|My type of book.  About people and the struggles they have, in this case, small children.  Very sad.  Believable. Readable.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I believe God meets Dr. Alexander right where he is in the arena of theology.  What is most important and this book showcases well is our Heavenly Father's grace, mercy and above all radical, life changing love.  Dr. Alexander's life on earth will never be the same..  He will reach a multitude..
B00991TCOG|5.0|I like the first 11 track, they give a total new taste, and sounds really good.<br />Although the last track feels a bit weird, I still give it a 92% rating (11/12 of the track were good).<br /><br />I heard people try blend in violin with modern taste before, such as \\"trance + violin\\", but they never did it so well.<br /><br />For someone who can compose own music, dance, sing, and look good is common.<br />Able direct and edit her own music video that well is something slightly special.<br />Able to change the way violin is played, create a whole new genre of music and yet still sounds so good is rarer.<br />Plus, able to dance on violin so well, and shine on stage...isn't even what Vanessa Mae can do.<br /><br />She's an amazing Music Artist, with interesting personality.<br />Compare with most Violinist that put to sleep;<br />Lindsey Stirling will make you dance and play an air violin even if you don't actually know how to play one.<br /><br />Her music is good, but just listening will not be enough.<br />She can also dance, and nobody can dance like her on violin.<br />The next best thing will be to watch her live perform.<br /><br />For the first time, instead of falling asleep;<br />I can't believe I actually dancing to the beat and violin at the same time.
B00C8REB8U|1.0|The disc I got did not work in either of my dvd players nor my xbox 360. Didnt come with the case. Which I was aware of, what I was not aware of was that I purchused what seemed to be a poorly burnt copy of the movie that doesnt even work. Very unsatisfied.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is great and fun .... nice speed ups and city building . wise there where more ways to get the major buildings in the city faster.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|This is a pretty good game!  The graphics are good for a free app.  The kids and I really enjoy it.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Very interesting story and I am glad I read it, but the ending was forced and trite.  You feel cheated because you get all the way there and then it doesn't make sense.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|A great cast of characters  many of whom have their on story line, and an engaging, developing plot.  Extremely well acted!  I like the small town English setting...familiar and exotic.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|What an upgrade from listening to music at my office with iPhone headphones! These headphones do a great job of blocking out ambient noise. They also sound good enough that I can tell the difference between standard iTunes purchased music and lossless files.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun Bingo game with cute graphics.  Easy to play and easy to continue playing without paying which works for me!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I was hesitant to listen to this album. I played the first tune and I was instantly shocked!! This is probably the best 2013 metal work I have listened.  Never thought Jason Newsted could overcome his Metallica years but he did it. The album is very flat though, no guitar or bass solos, but the ferocity, energy and Metallica style is present all throughout.  A must buy definitely.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|The Teen Beach Movie is a Disney DVD of the Disney Channel original movie that is a fitting tribute to the classic 1960's beach movies. Starring Ross Lynch, Maia Mitchell and Barry Bostwick, the movie tells the story of two friends Brady(Lynch)and Mack(Mitchell) having a great time at the beach and surfing when a out of control wave transports them to a 1962-set beach comedy movie Wet Side Story, where they are met with the characters from the movie. Now Brady and Mack must find a way to correct the film and return back to 2013 before it is too late. The opening credits of the film has a dedication to the late Annette Funicello, which I thought it was touching. The special features includes behind the scenes look of the dance sequences and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favorites like the Muppet Movie Anniversary Editon, The Little Mermaid, Return To Neverland and Super Buddies. The Teen Beach Movie is perfect for fans of 1960's beach movies!
B001TY3LSY|5.0|Not much else to say,,,It's a great recording of Harry..  The sound is good, and the disc appears to have been well-produced.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is a 2012 Disney DVD of the critically-acclaimed PIXAR animated adventure and introduces to the world the newest addition of the Disney Princesses, Merida! Kelly MacDonald provides the voice of Merida in this tale of courage as Merida is being planned by her mother, Queen Elinor(Emma Thompson)to be married, but Merida believes she should get betrothed on her own terms. Feeling bothered by her mother's choices of suitors, Merida seek advice from a old witch, but what she did not know that the witch had turned Elinor into a bear trough a curse, and Merida now must get her mom, and her little triplet brothers back to normal. The special features includes two PIXAR short films, The Legend Of Mordu and La Luna, as well as sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favorites like Sofia The First and Finding Nemo 3D. Brave is the perfect addition to any Disney DVD collection and the great way for everyone to get to know Merida, the first Disney/PIXAR Princess!
B001DHXT2U|4.0|Not a bad movie. Was different than I was expecting. A bit darker than I would have thought it would be.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The story was wonderful, engaging and fast moving. Kept my attention completely. The ending (almost) ruined it. Too preachy. I still loved the book. Would have certainly made 5 stars without the after messages.
B001C08RHA|5.0|An excellent movie! Love Robert Downey Jr.! Watch it again and again! My son especially loves this movie! Buy it!!
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|The movie is mostly for children. I am a fan of Tim Burton's movies and I must say that's the first time I am a little disappointed with his work.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|A very interesting and fascinating movie! Love Chris Evans! He's the perfect Captain America! Looking forward to seeing him in more Avengers movies!
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|Grab this one if you are feeling stuck or lacking in direction.  It will get you re-energised and looking forward again.  I suggest you follow this up with getting some help or undertaking some self-study on the tactical side of implementing the ideas James presents in his book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! I watch it again and again. Can't wait for the next one to come out!! Awesome!!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|If you are looking for another Kite Runner, keep looking.  The book was simply ok.  I could have stopped reading anytime without feeling guilty which is rare for me.  Phyllis Molloff

0142406112|5.0|Alex is a 14 year old boy who suddenly gets forced into solving the mystery of the death of his uncle. Alex didn't realize his uncle Ian had being preparing him all his life to come a spy.<br />  The Author gets the interest of the reader by keeping them off their seat with suspense. You don't know what is going to happen next. During Alex's mission to solve the evil Sayle's plan, he ends up in a huge fish tank. He must use his quick thinking and special spy gear to get himself out of a bad situation. All I have to say is, Portuguese man-of-war.<br />  I would recommend this book for kids my age and older. It's was a mind blowing adventure reading this book with many different obstacles in his way throughout his voyage. It was an overall fantastic read.
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson's latest book, One Summer: America,  1927 was a bit intimidating at first. At just over 450 pages, it is a bit of a chunkster.  Yet, in typical Bryson fashion, this book is easily readable Although non-fiction and full of interesting tidbits about life in America in 1927, it reads as though it were a story.<br /><br />Charles Lindbergh, Babe Ruth, and Herbert Hoover are three famous Americans whose lives during that one amazing summer are recounted.  Other people, no less important, but without as much name recognition also have their stories told.  Bryon writes of the biggest school explosion ever that happened in 1927, the Mississippi's record breaking floods, and the murder trial of Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray who had killed Ruth's husband so the two could be together.<br /><br />This entire book is entertaining and informative and an amazing recounting of one special summer.  I have read several of Bryson's books in the past, but One Summer may be his best book to date.
B003F9G8B8|4.0|If you enjoy a feel good look at a painful time in history you will enjoy this film. Morgan Freeman is, as always, convincing as is Matt Damon - this film is a great way to get high school athletes thinking about the meaning of team competition in unifying groups around a cause...a little slow at times, but well worth the patience -
B00881VLCE|1.0|Old version worked great...I played daily...new updated version is nothing but problems...slow &amp; not responding.  Will wait a few months and maybe try again....until then I do not recommend this
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is the best one in the series! The other ones were good but a little annoying by being directed how to set up the city. This one, you can do it however you want. Reccomended
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I am a die hard fan.  I love Trent Reznor's layered sounds putting you on the precipice and pulling back just as the tension roils.  The older pieces reveal unnoticed sounds every time I listen.  There is always something new in the old.  I also love Reznor's fabulous piano work as counterpoint.  This is not it.<br /><br />Trent's transformation in the past several years is apparent.  He does not have to overtly claim that he is a new man like he repeatedly does.  That is obvious.  It is great that he has found his slice of happiness.  I just wish that he had retained some of the musical complexities that he presented when not so pleased with life and love.<br /><br />Hesitation Marks is commercial.  The music is upbeat and consistent.  I just cringe when lyrics contain \\"ooooh's\\".  His European dance audience must be pleased.  The 'minimalist' presentation sounds like he just did not spend the time on this one.  Way too much drum machine.  I thought that he recorded this one with other really good musicians.  So sad that he has lost so much texture.<br /><br />So why 4 stars?  Trent Reznor as Nine Inch Nails is still some of the best listening out there.  His live performances are unmatched for creative musical presentation and visual art.  I think that there is no one better.  I just long for some aspects of his old self.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Fun game easy for kids ...lets u earn diamonds level up is quick. Only complaint online is wonky kicks you off or will not let u on often

B004HWYTP4|5.0|Can't wait to see the sequels.  Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors but they were all really good.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Good album. Sad to know one has cancer. Seen them live a week ago. Ozzy in rare form and covered album well.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Lots of action and I like fairytales and the different take the movie took with it.  I didn't give it five stars because some of it was just a little bit too crazy would watch a sequel though.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I bought this set for a good price.  The DVDs came earlier than I expected and well packaged.  I am very happy with this purchase and the dealer I went through.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|Less tedious than the real thing, you keep the abilities you earn as you play successive iterations of the game (if you developed a company good at sims, for instance, your next brand-new company will have that skill--provided it has &#34;discovered&#34; it, of course).
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Loved the remake or sequel, whatever you want to call it.  Though critics didn't like it, I thought it was better than most people felt.  Great special effects and visuals, and action sequences, in fact I wished there had been more action; and the story wasn't that bad.  Enjoyed the film so much I purchased it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|at first I was bored by how easy the levels were. then all of a sudden they ramped up the difficulty. totally tested my brain and I'm excited for more levels! definately try out this game
B003OUXECE|5.0|I loved every second of this novel. Please pardon this superfluous review, i wanted to give this book the 5 tars it deserved, but amazon has word limits.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Loved this book. It was both entertaining and insightful. I thought there was a definite message too. The problems with our prison system are becoming issues we can't ignore anymore.
088103052X|5.0|I've read this book before and watched the movie a few times.  However, this was bought for a gift to y 12 year old grandson, eighth grader, and knowing him and what he likes, he's going to enjoy this book.  I especially liked the artwork on the front cover.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Generally I liked the story and characters. I typically enjoy reading first person narratives where you can question the viewpoint being presented and look for the objective. In this particular book I felt like there wasn't enough on the page to really reveal all that could've been demonstrated. It leaves something to be desired and I can't decide if that's intentional due to a trait of the narrator, or just very basic writing. I liked it nevertheless and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some perspective.
0374214913|3.0|If one likes fantasy and computer futuristic possibilities, you will like this book. It just isn't my type of story.
B005PK553C|4.0|I gave this show 4 stars because I thought it was a good premise and generally scary. There were some stronger performances by Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Evan Peters, Lilly Rabe, Taissa Farmiga, and Zachary Quinto. I have to admit that I was a tad biased going into watching this as I had watched the 2nd season of American Horror Story first when it aired on TV (and I'm a Nashville fan, which Connie Britton is fantastic in). Generally, the story lines all crossed and fell together in interesting ways. My only weak point, which is actually kind of big, was Dylan McDermott's character. I don't know if the fact that he had an affair in the first place, or if the writing just never redeemed him enough to be likable, but about half-way through I just didn't care if he stuck around or not.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto is in a smaller role in this season than the second one, but he still shines just as much. So excited to see who all comes back for season 3.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|It arrived in good shape and have played it over and over and over already.  I love Maria Brink and the cd is awesome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I saw all the quotes and how this book was made into a movie, I had to get my hands on it. Since then, it has become my favorite book and is the only book that has made me really cry. It is very easy to relate to whether you went through the same things as Charlie or not. It is very well written and every time I re-read it, it just gets better. Would highly recommend to anyone!
B00EQUP3Q6|1.0|I consider myself a pretty hardcore fan of nine inch nails. I love everything from his purest feeling demos, all the way to his ambient stuff in ghosts. I love his collab with saul williams, and I can even get down with the stuff he did with his wife in how to destroy angels. It takes me a lot to dislike an album from an artist I like, A LOT. This cd,is one that I cannot get behind no matter how much I love trents music. This is a very watered down version of the slip, which is 10 times better than this. That is funny to me, cause the slip was made in three weeks and this took way longer and it sucks. the lyrics aren't bad, but the way they are sung are. for example listen to the songs \\"copy of a\\" and also \\"everything\\". The whole album feels like trent stuck a bunch of random throwaway songs together just to put out some new nin material. The only redeeming factors of this cd are the songs \\"various methods of escape\\" and \\"all time low\\" and even those songs are mediocre at best. Don't be fooled by the cover which is reminiscent of the cover art for the downward spiral, it is nothing like that. If this is the way nine inch nails is going to sound, I hope he gets the sense to put it to rest before he ruins the name further.
B008602KQI|5.0|For Best Story and Exciting Movie Ever !!!!!!!!  I Can't Wait For The Sequel OF This Movie is Going To be Epic.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I think the dictionary is great as well as very handy and close by at any time. Thank you!!!!!  Great for any age!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Excellent movie! Epic tale full of non-stop entertainment. Superb acting! Opened me up to classic literature. There must be a sequel for this!!!
B00BP29SAA|2.0|Very frustrated with this game because we have NOT been able to find directions for how to use it.  Lots of time spent hunting, with pitiful results.  It's been a shame because the kids love shopping and really wanted to play.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|I love this music.  Sorry , Whitney Houston did not live a full life.  She was a great singer.  She will be missed by all.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|The game play is fun,but it does take a while to load. The really fun aspect to the game is the commentator's dialogue. I bought the full version and have really enjoyed it.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|This is a GREAT app if you want your phone to freeze up. Does not work. Don't waste your time!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. I simply could not put it down. Wonderfully written, funny, shocking and moving. I felt the gamut of emotions for each character. I highly recommend!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun game that has a lot of different games it is fun trying to unlock all of the game very fun game that everyone should play
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|A gritty take on the classic character.  Violence scenes were bloody and tarantino-esque.  Some interesting camera angles and visual story telling
B00B89WXYS|5.0|It's so rare to hear a cd where all the songs are good. This cd is refreshing and I'd think one song is my favorite until I heard the next. If this type of music is your thing, I can't imagine not feeling satisfied.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|It plays many things that the Kindle won't play. I like the fact that it was free. Easy to use.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|The movie was okay.  There were some funny parts, some cute parts, but for the most part it appeared to be a bunch of unrelated stories that did not really seem to fit or make sense all of the time.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Very uplifting!  What a great, true story of two lost souls who found each other.  I wish the best for both!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|season one was great but whoa... season two is even better.  just starting on season 3.  you won't be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game my aunt loves this I love it great for kids from 7_21 u should really by this game because it's awsome and  if u like my little pony well be shore to get the my little pony game
B003TSEL7S|3.0|This book is good, but it is kinda hard to read after the Percy Jackson series, especially after the action packed the last Olympian.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I have read the three Hosseini books, and felt sad as each ended because I felt like I was losing a close group of friends I had developed relationships with.  He is such a great writer, and makes the reader aware of so many intricacies in other cultures that we otherwise could only learn from a scholarly source.  Very informative and enjoyable book.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Good product, you get what you order. I dont really use the pen because its too big and uncomfortable to write with but the other one it good.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This story gave me pause as to what could  be or what could have been. I highly recommend this book.
0307719774|5.0|This journal is awesome! I find myself excited to do my entries each day!  I will be getting more to share!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|not very likeable.  not worth the price and it was free!  Even if they paid me i wouldn't like it.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I can explain this whole CD in one word: SUPERFANTASTIC.  This whole CD is great from the 1st song to the last.  I haven't heard a supergroup this good since \\"Temple of the dog\\".
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Interesting choice for the free app of the day, given the ongoing US Open tennis tournament.<br /><br />I was going to pass on this after seeing some of the more negative reviews, but I decided to give it a try after reading some of the more recent reviews and I'm glad I did.  It's one of those physics games where you bounce an object off of things to hit targets.  As is typical with these games, that's easier said than done at times, as the ball doesn't always go where you want it to go.  That adds to the challenge and the fun of the game, in my opinion.  Aside from good game play, this game also has fun cartoon-style graphics and a funny back story.  Is it the most original concept?  Of course not.  However, that doesn't mean it's not well done.  Also, I'm a longtime tennis fan, so the fact that the main character, Pete Pagassi, is obviously modeled after Andre Agassi (right down to the long blonde hair and headband he wore at the beginning of his career) makes it even more fun.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|Very nice movie.<br />Maybe even better than the first one that I really like!<br />Touchy and sentimental, but also very ironic!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This was my first game of this genre and I am hooked so it isn't a bad little game.  Seemed to go by too quick.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Wish the places existed maybe they do or did in another time or another name but overall carter crossing fort kelham and sheriff Elizabeth d.  Will prove to be lasting and unforgettable characters  in a great novel.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Our boys also really enjoyed the movie - had enough action in it to satisfy kids, but also a great message in stepping up to always do the right thing, no matter how unpopular or uncomfortable it might feel at first.  I would've given it 4 stars, because I admit the acting in some spots can be a bit shaky, but these are Christians and not big name stars - so they get 5 stars from me for their effort in providing inspirational, family friendly entertainment.  One of the actors was also in Fireproof - another very good movie which stars Kirk Cameron, about how easily a marriage can fall apart with continued neglect, and how to save it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book really keeps it simple and easy to follow...I enjoyed reading and practicing the techniques that the author has so eloquently shares...
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I don't like that Apple always forces us into the &#34;dongle world&#34; with everything needing an adapter... But this is small enough that i don't mind, and it let's me have one charger to rule them all...
B00181JGI2|5.0|If you haven't seen it, you should.  You'll probably love it or hate it.  Goodman is crazy-good in this flick.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Great Movie - Hope my future children will love this as much as me and my fiancé! Can't wait to buy the 2nd movie as it was just as good as the first, if not better! :)
B002KKCVS2|5.0|This was a gift for a first time teva wearer. They fit true to size. He loves them and can't wait to test them out at the lake and boating.  Fully adjustable around toes, heels and ankles. They look good.  Item shipped Fast!!! Got it sooner than expected.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Inexpensive and great sound quality - so light you can't even feel them on your head. Love this product and it is pretty durable as well.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Old tunes with a brand new twist; the plain and simple, it's excellent music!  I like it more with every play!.
B00846REIS|5.0|3rd time around! Still love it! So in love with Gideon, I want me one! Jealous of Eva, so jealous!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|cute game. fun to pass the time. enjoyable to both me and my nephew. we have spent much time building our colorful funness
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I had no idea what to expect and after reading the reviews (at the time there were only a few and they were all pretty negative or very negative) so I almost passed up taking advantage of this faotd. The game doesn't look like much but it is fun. I have a handful of little games that I play when I'm bored so it looks like I'll be adding this one to my little collection.<br />The object of the game is to hit as many bad guys as you can using in the least amount of throws  and you get bonus points for hitting the guys in their face. There are objects introduced that you can hit with the ball to help hit more guys and there are objects (glass) that you try to avoid or else the ball will stop if it hits it. The story line in the beginning is kinda funny and I really like the background music.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I take this with me where ever I go. So many versions to refer to. Quickest response when going from one bible reference to another. It is like having a large library available all the time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great and its fun!! Great way to pass time(: Quick and easy! Not much technical problems and the minions ate adorable!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app works great 1 it doesn't have a single glitch  ( haven't seen one yet) it doesn't close on you and it take you to sleep super!!!!! Fast!!
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|The book describes how to build a home aquatponic gardening. When following the instruction I feel like building my home gardening easily. The book also explains the theory of how such gardening works,.This system is really efficient eco-system taking advantage of miniaturized natural environment of symbiosis between fish and plants.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|I love 19th century literature but I struggled with Persuasion. It plodded along and was rather predictable. In many of Austin's novels she deals with social class, etc but this was too overt for me to really enjoy.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Guy Clark just gets better with age. From the beginning of this album you mesmerised by his ability to put words to music
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An easy read dealing with darker subject matter using beautiful language and an interesting writing style. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was looking for something that would draw me in make me feel like I was part of it. I loved it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Not exactly a free app but coins regenerate while you sleep or work so you can play for free unless you are and addict gamer.
1607066017|5.0|Warning: Contains explicit nudity, language, and violence.<br /><br />That being said, the artwork is incredible and the characters are endearing - or interesting, if you end up disliking them. It's got a vibe like Star Wars, Samurai Champloo, and Cowboy Bebop... So if you're into any of those, then I'd recommend this series! Probably not for the squeamish or prudish. That being said, it's not like the series specifically caters to perverts or gore aficionados, it just happens every now and then.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game daily. My daughter saw me playing this game and called me the next. day to tell me she now plays the game on her lunch break.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It was a nice light, easy read.  It contained some very thought provoking topics.  Created a nice discussion for our bookclub!
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I loved this game until I updated it a couple hours ago. I lost everything! It started me back over at the beginning! I am deleting and moving on. I do not want to start all over again!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|THE STORY BEHIND RODRIGUEZ IS AMAZZZZZING .  His music should have hit the top of charts here in the USA. I wonder how his album was not picked up by a major record company.  this guy should have been as famous as the big names of his time.  GREAT MUSIC!!!!!!.  Every one should see the movie SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN.I think you can find it on STARS MOVIE CHAN.
0761536434|5.0|Outstanding and meticulously written book that's fun to read. Book ends with the PlayStation era of consoles and could use an update or sequel. As much a lesson in start up businesses as well as primer in game creation and full of interesting facts. Big gambles, blown opportunities, raging egotism and brilliant entrepreneurs. A must for anyone who lived through that time and loved that technology.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics and easy to understand. Never have problems with loading or playing. Fun and addicting for horse lovers as well as those who don't know much about them. Isn't very educational though.
140006922X|5.0|Found the book very interesting and full of historical information. My favorite part from the book &#34;Because the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth - Jesus the man - is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ.  He is in short, someone worth believing in&#34;
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and addicting game but only for up to level ten before it tells you to buy to buy the expansion
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|My fiance and I were pleasantly surprised by this movie, as it did not get a lot of press on its initial release. We thoroughly enjoyed it and spent most of our breakfast hour trying to untangle the web we saw in the film last night. Rooney Mara was fantastic--I loved her in \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" and can't wait to see her career unfold--and Catherine Zeta-Jones was great in her return to the screen after a long stint on Broadway. I often find Jude Law rather tiresome, but he really held his own and pulled the audience into the narrative. This was a great movie--not an Oscar winner, but one worthy of a rewatch and a great way to spend a lazy afternoon.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Rooney Mara's performance was pretty good. She had me convinced.<br />I would have liked to have seen a different ending. :)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I think this is a Great Show.  Does include the last Christmas episode. um need to type three more words :)  OK
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very good  tough in some places. Sometimes it takes 3 runs to get thru one game, others just work out just right
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Love the timers for cooking and the alarm is ok. I haven't really played with all of the bells and whistles but otherwise does what you need it to.
B005JCT4B0|5.0|I love the indevidual sleaves they come in but i wish it was the original album print on the disc's but that doesnt make a difference in my book! Great Deal!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I didn't think this game would be nearly as fun as it is.  I got it with a deal, but would definitely pay full price for it.  Have already enjoyed hours of fun with it.  If you can play a trial, then do so!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's awesome and I really like it it works it brain and helps u remember things and also improves that to so any and everybody should download this a play.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a sensational recounting of the making of a man of honor, dedication and valor.  While he is an exceptional individual, it is even more remarkable to note that he is not alone.  Marcus Luttrell follows a breed of valient men whose creed is honorable, whose dedication to duty is indefatigable, and whose very existence should expand every American chest with glowing pride.<br /><br />I highly  recommend this wonderful narrative to every American household and to every human being who wants to experience a sense of the ideal American Warror!
B00138KN3C|5.0|40 years old and the stories and characters still hold true.  I hadn't listened to it in 20 years, but it seemed as fresh and relevant as it did in 1972.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started with the show, and ended up addicted to Goodkind's breathtaking story-telling skills. It may not be for everyone, but being a fan of fantasy books, this one jumps off the pages and even if you've already seen the show!
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Really sweet acoustic and mellow songs.  Love her voice and love the tempo of the entire CD.  Well done KT!<br /><br />THe more I listen, the more I love it
B009CGAMK6|5.0|I've heard others say that you love the Les Mis that you see first. This was my first in terms of the concert -- and the music is transcendent. Alfie Boe's musical rendition of Jean Valjean is perfection. As I describe to others, the theatrical release of Les Mis&eacute;rables last year was great for its cinematic qualities. This version is wonderful for the musical qualities of the show. My only grouse is the whining of Nick Jonas. I know some people love him and defend him based on his limited operatic training, but with a cast so near perfection, it is truly sad that the best they could muster was an old Jonas brother. During the finale when the original London cast performs, Michael Ball as Marius, blows Jonas out of the water. Otherwise, a gorgeous show.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My hubby gave me this book over a year ago for our anniversary and I didn't read it....figured he had ulterior motives lol! I finally caved, after everyone I know had read it and said it was a &#34;must read&#34;. Great fun summer reading, gotta go read the next one! &#34;Laters Baby!&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|can not stop playing... making pregnancy bed rest so fun. it does take some time to load. minions are just way too cute.
B0000A02U2|5.0|The classic National Lampoon movie that bridged John Belushi's transition from Saturday Night Live to an explosive (yet sadly too short) film career.  From the moment the movie opens with the mannequin being thrown out the window to the &#34;where are they now&#34; closing credits, this movie fills each frame with laughs.  If there is one film to seal in a canister to be opened a thousand years from now depicting comedies of the twentieth century - this hits the nail on the head.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I was pleased that I purchased the UK edition. After reading customer reviews on Amazon.com  that the UK edition is a better version I found this to be true.  Thanks for offering the Original UK edition and having customer reviews on your website.
B00009RGBS|5.0|This movie is just like the play....wonderful and could watch it again and again. No wonder it won so many awards!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|it is nbot like the ordinary star trek movies...great acting..very funny...both my husband and I enjoyed watching this movie...and he has seen all of them many times over anbd if he liked it then you know it was a good movie LOL
B00005O3VD|5.0|No words can explain just how wonderful the movie is!! Music acting laughing and tears. All great!!!!  So true to Fanny Brice's life!  Marion Edawrds
B004KPX4W2|5.0|a lot of good actors in it both my husband and I enjoyed watching this movie...loe Bruce Willis highly reccomend if you enjoy action movies
B008Y768XO|5.0|A little slow for my 8 year old son, but the rest of our family thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It did make mom cry.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|Im am a huge Ariana Grande fan this is the best album I ever bought.She has an amazing voice I have all her songs and I really hope another album will come out Ill buy it. Im also learning to sing like her. Love you Ariana
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Interesting way of telling a story but also confusing at times.  I'm not sure whether I could say it was a page turner
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|by far the funniest game ive ever played on the kindle.. there needs to be a diamond dash 2!!!!!!!!!!!##!!!.. does anyone know of other games on the amazon app store like this one?
B004RJMUJO|1.0|ok so this app is supost to be good right? well its not very good I think it should be better then the free version but apparently that's to much to ask for I'm just sharing my please don't be mean because I'm sharing
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app has been a lifesaver at the store, I tend to always go over what I have to spend and it's very embarrassing to have to pick and choose what items that I need, want and the things that my family can't live without i.e. toilet paper etc. I'm so happy that I got this and for FREE! How can you beat that!!??!!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I hate the fact that you have to keep buying coins to make progress but my 3 year old liked the limited features  for the time we had it on the kindle.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Amazing book I love it ! It's interesting, sad and an adorable love story. I definitely recommend it ! ! !
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I hate the fact that its really hard to get out of this game once I start playing. Also, I dont see the point of this game.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Pretty fun. I think it's my favorite of the four pictures-one word games so far. I wish the hints were better, though. The only one that's helpful is the one that answers the question.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|If you like batman, which I'm guessing you do if you're looking at this then this item is for you.<br /><br />It gives you the new batman trilogy dvds in one set and gives them in a unique and interesting container.<br /><br />Overall great buy for the price.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Fun stuff. I particularly enjoyed the witty banter between Atticus and Oberon· REALLY need a Wolfhound with that vocabulary. Good read at a good pace with some good characters.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book and all off the Crossfire books are as good as Fifty Shades of Gray. If not better.Amen . A must read....
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Lots of fun..!!! Challenging and addictive...bought the full version.....worth every penny.....always a surprise in store to keep u guessing &amp; entertained.
0316044695|5.0|I have not actually read it yet, but have heard great things and am excited to start it.  I am excited to read such an intense firsthand account of combat.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a fantastic series. The costumes are so beautiful and the characters are extremely interesting and surprising.  Very addictive.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! First because it's full of minions and second you get to beat vector!!! Third you get to play as a minion how cool is that?!!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I've always worked in Hi-Tech and enjoyed this book, both for the insight about Apple and Steve Jobs, but also the history of the personal computer.  It's very much about his working environment and professional life.  They didn't include much detail about his home life at least not in the same way as the Apple details.<br /><br />It's a long book and dragged a little bit in the middle. But all-in-all I enjoyed it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|If you like solitaire, you will love this twist on an old game. Spider solitaire is challenging and fun! I became addicted pretty fast.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I gave one star because the system didn't allow me to give zero<br />The Gospels are undoubtedly full of myth an fiction. However this writer, so-called historian is as inaccurate, micking and self-contradictory writing as he is in speaking<br />A bad book written by a bad writer
B001EC3JME|3.0|Use it for work, it's okay, but its a bit hard getting the flashlight back into the holster, you almost have to take the holster off your belt and pull the holster apart to get the flashlight in.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book started out fine, but the further and further into it I got, the less believable I found it. And I hated the ending (won't give it away here). Overall, a disappointment. I liked Sharp Objects a lot, and expected more here.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I really liked this one and i have to read the last two book. Good story. And i like that the whole werewofl thing is different than other books
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Its hard to get past the knee jerk reaction of &#34;they deserve it&#34; when you think of prisoners, but this book really makes you explore another side!
B00DW36G32|2.0|It's hard to care about this films characters given their past crimes.  De Niro exacts revenge on Serbs after witnessing their heinous war crimes.  Travolta using a ridiculous accent survives that revenge and seeks payback decades later.  So they beat the hell out of each other while rolling around the Great Smokey Mountains.  In the end of this yarn they both come to acceptance of their scars but by then who the hell cares? De Niro is truly a great actor but even he needs a paycheck.  Travolta is getting old, fat and tiresome.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I'm not usually a huge Tom Cruise fan but when I saw the trailers for \\"Oblivion\\" I knew I'd be watching the movie. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />This movie was gorgeous on Blu-ray. Special effects were stunning. I was sitting here during the movie trying to pick out all the Earth sites that I could identify that weren't totally destroyed. Sound quality was super. Subtitling was done well (I'm partially deaf and it makes a huge difference to me in the enjoyment of films I watch).<br /><br />The storyline was easy to follow, which doesn't always happen in newer sci fi films. There were a lot of twists and turns but I followed them all (or at least I'm pretty sure I did).<br /><br />This one is a keeper. I'm sure I'll be watching it again.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Thanks for honoring the &#34;Bakersfield&#34; country music in a great way.  And what better way than done by Vince Gill & Paul Franklin!!!!
B005SAJRV0|5.0|Must have for comedy collection!  &#34;The Adhesive Duck Deficiency&#34; episode is one if my all time favorites....but they all are funny so buy them all....
B009AP2G26|5.0|Some of the best single performances especially Rachel.  KH has abs and a attitude that is loving and down right frightening.
B008NEMN0K|3.0|Love this movie and remember seeing in theatre when it first came out.  I thought how could you make the movie better?  3D?  sure why not.  The 3D is ok, but you can tell they cut some corners by leaving the background so flat is some parts of the movie that its almost funny (and funny to look at).  Overall its ok, but don't expect anything to appear 2 feet off the screen like in other 3D movies (Hansel and Gretel).
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have enjoyed this game very much as you can play a game in under 5 minutes and you can also challenge yourself to do them even faster.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I got this  for my girls but they have yet to play it because I won't let them it's fun the only draw back is you can't get its faster
B00E7SID9G|2.0|I would have expected more from someone supposedly academically qualified. Most of his stuff is just a rerun of the dozens of skeptical &#34;lives&#34; of  Jesus written by naysayers of various ilks. Nothing new here!
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Love Selena's &#34;Stars Dance&#34;.  More mature than here previous three CD's and as a result not 100% appropriate for some of her younger fans.  Nonetheless it is an excellent musical effort.  From beginning to end the songs are pleasing, fresh, and infused with a variety of sounds.  Many artists are so monotonic that it is hard to listen to an entire album.  This album delivers many surprises along the way and each one is enjoyable.  Excellent album.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is definitely one of those stories that sharing your favorite bits will spoil the best parts of the book(s)! Infinitely satisfying story full of good twists and turns with very well developed characters, great pacing and a very believable world. I was glued to my kindle from start to finish (in about 3 days).
B0054R6BFM|2.0|As someone who works with youth and who was one, I can say that this had to be one of the worst books I have read. I was really interested in the idea of this book but the execution was poor to say the least. Just my opinion, but I felt there was little to no character development. Suicide is a very serious topic. To show that she threw her life away for trivial things truly bothered me. I don't want to give spoilers away, in a pivotal scene, I was disgusted that this girl basically allowed a crime to happen when she had the ability to stop it. There were many things that bothered me about this book. I think the best part of the book was when it was over
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was having trouble with my old charger so the people at amazon suggested I buy this along with the powerfast and away it goes!
1451695195|5.0|This book is a great insight into a non believing person that has seen the Light and now knows the truth.  I loved Dr. Alexander's account of how he learned the truth, because I have seen the face of a heart surgeon who,  just like the author of this book, was a scientist and didn't believe, but one day saw proof that God was real and here with us. This heart doctor put his faith in what he could see and what he was able to prove like so many intelligent people do, (including myself before I had my own personal experience with Jesus).  Then one day he had to face the fact that God healed a hole in my wife's heart.  A hole that this Doctor had seen himself and a couple of weeks later, this hole was gone.  Our church and many other people prayed for my wife and one night she sat up in bed and said her chest was burning, but that it didn't hurt.  Each moment after that, she kept getting stronger.  She kept her appointment with the heart surgeon, but told him as he walked in the room that she was healed.  He said\\" yes,yes, now this test is the last one we will do before surgery, with it we can best tell how to close this hole in your heart\\".  I was  in the waiting room when this Doctor came out and had this befuzzled look on his face and told me \\" I couldn't find the hole\\". He actually sat down next to me.  I asked him what we should do, and he said, \\"I don't know\\" and I could tell he had not said those words in a very long time.  Reading this book reminded me so much of that experience because of the Doctors' reactions to proof of God.  We think we know so much, but we really don't.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I really enjoy this CD. I am always so please when I can listen to the whole thing and like it, ever song!
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Enjoyed it almost as much as the older version with Kurt Russell. Had seen that version years ago. Had to see the prequil
B0007939NO|4.0|Great scenery, great dancing, Gene Kelly and company do some great singing.  It was a pleasant two hours.  Nothing profound, just entertainment.
B0037Z95Z6|1.0|This is the second copy I purchased.  Neither the first nor the second would load on my Blu-ray player.  After contacting BBC I was told this is the wrong Blu-ray region.  The product descriptions simply say, &#34;for all regions&#34;  they are definitely not!
B002MG0NYS|5.0|We have looked all over for this movie for years! So glad we could rent it! My kids thought it was really funny!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I could tell this show came from such great source material. The story was timeless and yet provocative. The violence and sex were not there for their own sake, which is to say they were a necessary part of the story. I am hooked and can't wait to read the books.
B00640UICA|5.0|My daughter got this game for free on her Kindle. I never pay for games, but when I tried it, I had to have it. It's fun and challenging. Also, the characters are super cute!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game and wish there were more levels. It was a fun challenge. I hooked some of my friends up with it too, but we really wish there were more free levels.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great read- very dark, but suspenseful.  Flynn is a great writer- I can't decide which of her novels I like best, because they are each so good in their own right.
B004GYY714|4.0|It's nice to listen to the radio stations of your hometown without using satellite radio. Listen to talk radio in the Caribbean.
B000006NPY|5.0|I have it hard to describe how amazing this album, or just band is.<br />(favorite band)<br />when i for the first time did hear this album i heard it more than 10 times at the day, i couldn't/can't get enough of Smashing pumpkins, but this album is just so amazing. Billy have really a wordless talent in to write music, lyric and just the soul in the music, it's amazing.<br />Smashing pumpkins have the most special place in my heart because it's the only thing i really love, just their music is the most amazing i ever have heard and seen life.<br />they have saved many's life and included my own. and i can only be thankful for that. their music is just make me speechless, no matter what they  have done.<br /><br />if i could i would give this album my own live for it, but that's just sound pretty, stupid in some peoples ear, but i only mean the best.<br />and this came from my heart.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|It's a great book for any &#34;starters&#34;! Simple do's and don'ts with examples from real life to support them. You will come back to this one over and over.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|What's not to love about this movie?! I mean really? If you're on the fence just be like mike and do it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This app provides definitions while in other apps or books in my kindle. Also, can be used directly to find a word quickly without going through the whole dictionary as some other dictionaries do. I would recomend it.
1843175703|5.0|Very well written book and good storyline my wife enjoyed it very much.  The book is bound well and has a simple but nice design to it.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Like many others, I first discovered Ariana Grande on her hit show \\"Victorious.\\" She only had two featured songs from the soundtracks (\\"Give It Up\\" and \\"LA Boyz\\") and I could tell she had an amazing singing voice but was overshadowed by Victoria Justice (the star of the series). I then discovered her youtube channel and realized that she is the real deal in terms of having singing talent.<br /><br />Long story short, I have been anticipating the debut album for a very long time and it was well worth the wait. Here is a breakdown of my review:<br /><br />VOICE: Her voice is definitely the highlight of the album. The range she has is incredible and she is basically doing vocal gymnastics with her 5-octave range. The Mariah Carey comparisons are getting a little old but seriously, who else can sound like that? Songs like \\"Lovin It,\\" \\"Baby I,\\" and \\"You'll Never Know\\" are all RNB throwback songs that have that early Mariah Carey sound. However, she doesn't sound Mariah-esque on all songs. \\"Tatooed Heart,\\" and \\"Daydreamin'\\" are both 60's doo-bop inspired songs where Ariana sounds mature beyond her years.<br /><br />PRODUCTION: The songs on the album are kept fresh and current with excellent production. At some points it seems like the songs are too-produced but it doesn't take away from enjoying them. The other thing about the production of these songs is that there is a variety. From simplistic ballads, to upbeat dance songs and even the EDM-inpsired track \\"Better Left Unsaid,\\" one does not have to worry about the album sounding like it's stagnant.<br /><br />TRACK LISTING: I love all the songs (there is only one I skip over). Many of these songs tell a love story (hence the album title) and her voice is so good that the songs sound very honest. It also didn't hurt that she co-wrote half of the album as well. The only track that just does not feel right is \\"Popular\\" with MIKA. That might have been a decision by the label to include it on the album and the song isn't bad,it just feels like it does not belong with the other tracks.<br /><br />This album is refreshing to hear and Ariana definitely deserves all the success! In the end, I say buy it because there are not too many quality, pop albums available now-a-days. In comparison to her other teen peers, she's definitely has it all together (and rightfully so).
1400062756|4.0|The book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success Hardcover by Carol Dweck just arrived.  I cannot wait to begin reading it.
1451627297|3.0|Stephen King has written a fascinating take on time travel and the ramifications of changing history.  Jake is given the task of going back to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating Kennedy.  But that is only a part of the story.  I have to admit that I am not a science fiction fan and I was reading this for a book discussion group.  I did get involved in the characters and the story; I was fascinated by the premise of the book.  But...it was really really long.  And it felt long.  I am not intimidated by hefty books but I did find myself skimming some parts of this to move it along.  It is a good story and a lot is based on fact; the writing is very good, classic King style.  The characters were fleshed out nicely and it was easy to get involved in the various story lines.  So, while for me it was just ok...I think it most science fiction fans would like it much better than I did.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is my favorite of Johnny Depp Movies. Great entertainment.. I even named my two new gray kitties Benny & Joon.
B00CZAYOWI|4.0|Great to finally find both albums in one place.  If looking for one Cult disc or discs opt for this a lot of great tunes, to include Love Removal Machine
140006922X|5.0|I loved this book!  As an agnostic who loves to learn about the true historical roots of world religions, I was hooked to this book.  I had read Karen Armstrong's The History of God as well and this was as good.  Aslan did a fantastic job!  I highly recommend this book for those who seek to understand how religions evolve by their followers beyond their inception.
B004C6QCT6|5.0|Wore the vinyl out many moons ago.  I never thought to re-buy this until the Re-master.  Man, it still rocks and sounds so much clearer.  Great buy!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Amazingly written! Can't wait to read more from the author!! The last paragraph is now my new favorite quote!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Unusual plot.I like the history lessons about Australia I am going to read more by the same author. Recommend it
B004VMUS9G|2.0|good app&hellip;but it drains my battery. I use it at night while my KINDLE FIRE charges and my kindle fire is dead when I wake up. but every thing else is good and has many alarms.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins puts into words all the ideas, concepts and logical arguments proving that God is a myth. Recommended for someone looking to deprogram themselves or others.
B00003CXRM|3.0|The comparison of Everett in &#34;O Brother ...&#34;  to Homer's  Oddysseus takes a whole lot of imagination . . .<br /><br />The scene where the three escapees hopped the freighter was gut-busting-funny!  The music was great!<br />There was unnecessary swearing; specifically, the use of &#34;g-d&#34; as an expletive.<br />I would not recommend it as a family movie.<br /><br />But I appreciate your giving me the chance to voice my opinion, and I am favorably impressed with the service from Amazon!<br />Thank you.  Susan Summers
1401232590|4.0|Before I bought this book, I wasn't considering getting it because I wasn't a fan of the art (still am not), but I do say that this is one of the best Batman graphic novels out there.<br /><br />The story is pretty entertaining. The writer does a great job of telling the story and making it feel like a mystery worthy of the Dark Knight. While I'll go on record to say that I'm not a fan of Tim Sale's art, I will say that it does work for the story and I can appreciate it for what it is. One thing I do enjoy about the art, though, is how much it gives the novel that noir feel, so to me that's a plus. And the length of this while give you enough to read for a while. (On a side note, the cover of the book feels so cool; like it's made from a kind of suede-ish material which is probably not a good description but the best I could come up with).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great Batman graphic novel and recommend it to any Batman fan (art and all).<br />(P.S. it reads great after reading Batman: Year One)
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This was a great movie !!! I myself don't really enjoy the love genres but I have to say this really was a great movie. I don't think that you'd be dissapointed seeing this movie. The acting was very emotional and nice by both Ryan Rosling and Racheal McAdams.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Fantastic movie on the heels of a great (unfortunately short) series . . . one or more surprises for me--not necessarily the way I would have gone, but then again, I'm not Joss Whedon, who has delivered time and time again with awesome series and movies. HUGE FAN OF THIS ONE!
B003K15IF8|5.0|There must have been a reason why this gem had been covered by dust since the time it has been written. After having read it (my first experience with an eBook on a Kindle), I can't imagine any reason for this neglect.<br />Best of the story is of course Stoner's wife. The least attractive woman ever been described (as far as I know, of course). A great achievement for John Williams.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|don't enjoy the thought of pay as you go games. i think the games cost enough let alone pay as you go.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|The story about the stopping of time, or reversing time may be revolutionary and very provocative, what I like most about the Picture of Dorian Gray are the aphorisms. Read slowly, and you will discover many gems, and may retrieve double the fun.
B00CXQL828|3.0|I love all the musicians in this band.  MP and BS brought me to this album.  They created a great rock sound that's sure to be a hit.  Just not for me.  I've already heard enough Mr. Big-Soundgarden-80's power ballad nonsense to last a decade or 2.  Huh, those bands are at least 2 decades old aren't they?  Riiiight
B009CF7GRY|4.0|The acting isn't as good (not that it is stellar in the first Footloose) but the dancing is better, I think.  And the story is improved.  Our hero's host is more of a character, and the modifications to the story made it less cartoony and less cringeworthy, especially as the wives are involved.<br /><br />All in all, worth watching, but not sure you need both.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Given my total lack of knowledge of the people of that country (except through the eyes of our military) I welcomed this incredible  writer, who from beginning to end told us the story of his people in a most poetic way. He gifted us with a book that provides us with a narrrative filled with poetry..  Even in the worst case scenario his prose was amazingly beautiful from the first page on.,<br />Every sentence was a work of art. I loved the content, the words and the descriptive passages which gave me a glimpse of that country and its people.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Most of the songs are better than the originals and no annoying Glee-like auto-tune. All of the cast can sing - particularly Skylar Astin who is very yummy.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I originally loved the movie, given life by the director of &#34;Spirited Away,&#34; and reading the book was just as entertaining (if not more-so).
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I often enjoy movies that are critically reviewed as awful, so I didn't expect how bad this was really going to be.  I generally like Bruce Willis, enjoyed all the other Die Hard movies, so I expected this would be some good clean explosions and killing bad guys fun.  It was really bad.  The movie is a long series of attempts at some sort of emotional connection with an estranged son, but every bit of touchy feely acting falls flat and is completely unbelievable. The tagline for this one that Bruce Willis keeps repeating [variants of \\"Really?  I'm on vaCAtion!\\"] are especially cringeworthy.  The only part I found reasonably entertaining was the 20 something minute car chase, where they smash up a LOT of cars.  Seriously this is not an enjoyable movie and I regret spending $6 to rent it in HD. Watch RED instead. :-)
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|I have watched this twice and look forward to many more viewings.  Meryl Streep truly mirrors the prime minister as a young woman through all the years of her life.  This is an excellent portrayal of a wonderful woman.
B00B9366VO|5.0|So much great music had been recorded in these unassuming buildings. The merger of imagination and brilliant audio engineering were forged here.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Don't start playing if you have anything to do later.  I've lost hours playing this game.  Lots of easy fun.
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|Surely the super-fans would crucify me, dare I say anything negative about a NIN record.  Before you condemn me, let me say, there was a high level of unhealthy obsession I once had with NIN but this definitely has not carried over to the superfan Trent can do no wrong.  I didn't expect it to take very long for TR to resurrect the NIN moniker.  I actually was a big fan of the soundtrack work he did, as well as the Ghosts record, but Year Zero was what sent me packing.  The slip wasn't far behind.  As for this record, it's a little better than the two prior, but I expect that is not saying much.<br /><br />I understand that artists need to evolve, many of them change.  I only know a couple that have kept with the same formula and made it work.  I long for the golden years of NIN, which for me was The Downward Spiral.  A note on that.  When TR first released artwork and imagery for the new record, I was extremely excited as it suggested a throwback to TDS days (using the same typeface and Russell Mills artwork).  Was this to be a \\"sequel\\" of sorts?  An addendum?  Well, I don't see it at all.  The connection is weak and sadly seems more like a ploy than anything else.  This record picks up right where his other work left off, but adds a further element of Casio-keyboard loops and poppy riffs that just don't do it for me.<br /><br />Conceptually, the record has some weak points as well.  Even if I don't completely groove on the music right away there's a \\"I see what you're doing here\\" until you get to a track like \\"Everything\\" and you think... W.T.F.  \\"Satellite\\" also seems to be some bizarre homage to a hybrid of a choir and 70s funk.  This is a strange direction for TR.  The discussion on NPR about the new record seemed to imply the darkness of the record, seeing as it suggests suicide and other moments in TRs past that he has had to endure, but the music itself sounds a little to upbeat and excited.  Like I said, something you'd play at a Sunday service while clapping along to the infinite Casio loops.<br /><br />I know that he'll never go back to his distorted guitar industrial angry noise days.  That's not who he is anymore.  Fine.  I wish that he would just leave those days alone.  Why pretend to hash up an old era if the music is nothing more than a continuation of what you've been churning out since post-With Teetha era?  Sorry TR, I am mostly disappointed with this.  As a longtime fan, I had to indulge, but it certainly won't have playing this very often.g along to the infinite Casio loops.<br /><br />I know that he'll never go back to his distorted guitar industrial angry noise days.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google never ceases to amaze me. And this little doo-dad is no let down. We use it with Netflix and Youtube for most of our viewing pleasures. I can't wait until they add more features.
B002EUDBD2|5.0|Quick read and one that will stay in my library so I can read it again in the future.  Worth keeping.  It has wonderful stories and new perspectives on ways to look at life and appreciate the life we have.  Mitch Albom is a fantastic writer and one of my very favorites.  I have three of his books now and loved every one of them!!
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Solid, but unspectacular. I'd heard so many good things, I suppose I expected it to be a bit more entertaining.
B0018LMKIK|5.0|Dude, like this is THE BEST CCR, for the money. John Fogarty's wailing the Life out of living this life, along with the foot-stomping music makes this a Must Have for your home album library.
B001XUNQ4S|1.0|It stopped in the middle and could not watch the rest. I had to rent another to finish watching. I would like my $3.99 back!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is written with much wit and charm and vividly describes the fate of a young sole survivor of a shipwreck.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|After making Nine Inch Nails \\"go away for a while\\" to pursue other projects such as scoring two David Fincher movies as well as working with his wife Mariqueen Manndig and Atticus Ross in his other band How To Destroy Angels, Trent Reznor has reawakened Nine Inch Nails with a brand new studio album, an album that originally started life as two tracks for a greatest hits compilation turns into a full length album \\"Hesitation Marks\\" the first since 2008's \\"The Slip\\".<br /><br />The album is a lot more subtle in its approach with electronic beats creeping up on you and at times it can take a bit before the songs get going but when they do they all have slick sounding grooves, \\"Copy Of A\\" (which is currently being used to open Nine Inch Nails current tour which starts with all five members coming on to stage separately) has a very trance like beat going on with flourishes of guitar mixed in, it's an early highlight to the album. The first release from the album \\"Came Back Haunted\\" is driven by big beats and has a dance vibe throughout as well as throwing in a guitar solo at the midway point. \\"All Time Low\\" is a big slab of funk. \\"Everything\\" is the closet Reznor has ever coming to doing a pop punk number and is one of the most upbeat songs he has ever done.<br /><br />\\"Satellite\\" might just be the catchiest song on the whole album after a couple of listens it will be stuck in your head and at times comes across as NIN doing David Bowies \\"Fame\\". \\"Various Methods of Escape\\" is driven by lots of beats starting of low tempo before a breakdown in the middle leads to big pounding beats that take the song to its bid dramatic climax. \\"In Two\\" features a number of vocal effects and you are never quite sure what direction the song will go in, it's a contender for the best song on the album. The deluxe edition features 3 remixes the highlight being Todd Rundgen's remix of \\"All Time Low\\"<br /><br />Reznor shocked everyone back in March this year when he announced Nine Inch Nails would tour again and then followed it up with the news of a new album, he would go onto say that the new album is \\"F***ing awesome\\" and that's exactly what \\"Hesitation Marks\\" is.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Intense with good twists and turns! Looking forward to season 2 to get started.  Watched the whole series this last weekend.
B0000024JN|4.0|the cd was delived on time,the cd was fine with no damage or scratches,BUT THE CASE WAS DAMAGED AND CRACKED HAD TO TAPE IT SO THE CRACK WOULD NOT SPREAD!!WAS NOT FOR WARNED THE THE ITEM HAD A DAMAGED CASE!! DISS -APPOINTED!!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Helped to get my newborn to sleep!! This app was a true lifesaver! We also enjoyed the peaceful sounds! Kept the baby asleep for longer stretches. He loved the water sounds.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely worth playing.  Not a game to play half asleep though.  Takes a fair amount of concentration and lots of patience.  Tries to frustrate.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Stopped reading it. His snide arrogance is overbearing!<br />I would recommend this to his fellow Muslims.<br />Not worth my time.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Finished this book within a week! I love Garcia's writing, it was hard to put down. I am on to the third book and cannot wait to read the fourth.
B004IE0NY2|5.0|seperate from the new film called dredd this films story line is just that much better. Makes more sense and it just keeps you glued to the screen. It was made way before its time.
1592407889|5.0|I've always enjoyed Ms McLaine's performance and I even respected her views on the metaphysics of life but I knew there was more beneath the facade of glamour and charisma that surrounded her.  Her daughter, Sachi, has tried to understand the contradictions between her and the famous icon we've witnessed many times on the screen.  This isn't a \\"Mommiest Dearest\\" type of book because after reading it we get to see Shirley as a basically flawed mother who won't even finance her daughter's tuition into an acting class but will sabotage her career at whatever cost.  I believe Ms. Parker is trying to get closure between her and her mother but judging from her comments (It's a work of fiction), I doubt seriously it'll ever happen.  But perhaps there is still time to mend the fence between the two.  This is definitely a cut above Porter so-called bios on stars such as Steve McQueen, Paul Newman because it's a compassionate study of a dysfunctional relationshop between a daughter and her famous mother.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This series is so good and well acted.  Each episode as intense as the previous.  Cannot wait to get to the next episode each time
B001EC3JME|5.0|Nice extensible case for any Lamp (Include 502B). Have a good belt clip and you can rotate very easy when hold in waist for have light in front.
B003IWRE3I|4.0|Told in flashbacks to the past when things were normal, this apocalypse film is like many of its genre. We see the blasted landscape of the future when only a few have survived. It's getting colder. Food is running out, and humans hunt other humans for something to eat. Not everyone is evil, however, including the dad and son who tread the road in search of something better. The big event that triggered it all is not shown, probably because it would have cost too much in special effects. At one point, I thought the boy would turn out to be some supernatural messiah. Based on a literary work, this mostly grey film is not uplifting. Watch if you are not depressed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a middle school teacher this was a must read! Anyone who has a child going into middle school should read!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|LOVE this movie. We watch it every Friday. My son is 3 and he loves the music and the colors.  Highly recommend. Great for little kids.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I owned this CD when it was first released, and over the years I have seem to misplace it. I relied on Amazon to get me a real copy re-ordered.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I kept reading, thinking it was going to get better. but it never did!! I so wanted to like it because I was recommended by a family member...
B004I7IPL2|3.0|If you love the actress Betsy Russell as much as I do, do not watch this!  If there was one character who deserved to live through ALL the killings in this seven movie spread it would be Russell.  Sad...
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|I bought this for my husband since he liked Mayer's other CDs. I asked him how he liked this one he said, &#34;It's Okay.&#34;  Evidently it's different from any of his other work and was not what he expected.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Love playing.  Very creative.  Thought provoking.  Makes me want to see how many I can answer in one turn.  Addicting.  Wish you didn't have to pay for coins to get hints.  Stalls the game play.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|It's a bit tough to get through.  Not extremely exciting and not very gripping.  I had no problem stopping reading to start a different book.  I may go back to it after, but I'm not sure.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|It demonstrated just how sneaky some people can be -- whether in politics or in general. It also showed how devotion to one destructive person can also be very destructive.  Blind servitude to maintain someone in power is difficult to justify yet is so much a part of human behavior.  Fortunately, not all people are like that.  This series is a real eye-opener.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a no-brainer. Period. Very useful for collecting random bits of information. An app for an anthropologist! The intuitive layout is a treat, making it easy for the beginner to master it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The predictive text is great feature it's nice when it remembers what words you use together.  Numbers at the top are nice also.
B0097K21YW|5.0|If you like Angry Birds but worry about looking foolish try this.  Same mechanic but less cuteness. Got it as app of the day.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|After returning the first copy because of a bad track, the next was just fine.  We really love this movie, this is the second purchase, the first was watch so much that we had to replace the movie.  If you enjoy musicals you will love this one.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|I just finish watching this movie. It was so bad. The story was lame. The plot kept changing. Most of the characters, especially the kids, were annoying. There was a lot of cheap flashy CGI. There was a lot of actions scenes which you probably saw done a million times already in other movies. I don't recommend buying it, renting it, or even watching it for free. There's a lot of better 2 hour movies to watch than this one. I'm giving it one star, because I would probably like it if I was 9 years old, but I have to give one star anyways. My standards for these actors have just been lowered. If you want to see a magic movie check out illusionist and the prestige.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I like mid 1900 prose,  feel like music in my head when reading.  My first read from this author and I loved it.  A classic to read for any SF lovers.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|When I first saw &#34;Grumpy Cat&#34; in a book store I laughed so loud that people were staring and my husband was hiding.  It's my anytime go to book to put a smile on my frowny face.<br /><br />(Is this really Stewie Griffin in a cat suit?)
B001NLL93W|5.0|I just love the mortal instruments. It has amazing action and kind of love story. It's the best series I have ever read. I also liked the movie \\"City of Bones\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son has watched his friends play it and watched lots of videos of others playing it, but I couldn't get it to download on our computer and it cost $27.00 to do so anyway, which I wasn't thrilled about.  This was a reasonable way for him to get to play the game he loves.  He says the awesome part is you don't play with hearts and you can't die.  He says the bad part is you can't use the crafting table, the furnace or the chest.  You also can't go outside of your character to see him.  I don't know what all that means, but if you like to play, you probably do.
B00D4ABW82|5.0|Every song is worth listening to! The band is great and the lyrics are uplifting! I love this band a lot!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I keep hearing that this series is a duplicate of 50 when it is definitely not!!!  I agree that there are a few similarities, but the  characters are so much better/complex than 50!  Eva is smart, savvy, has been around the block & has her own money.  Gideon gets around but he's not deceptive about it.  I hate the domination crap in 50.  I wish they'd make a movie about these characters instead of 50!  The dynamics between these personalities would be far more captivating on screen.<br />Looking forward to more E & G!
B00470TOV0|5.0|The scenery was perfect as well the costumes and action was so real. Highly addictive movie.  Strong suggestion to watch..
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This is a fun app for the android and it makes for some very interesting pictures. The filter allows you to look at things in a way you normally wouldn't see them!
B002RI90WM|4.0|I enjoyed the objective assessment of a race driver's ability to focus on life in the present from one who could not compare his own life with his hero. The inclusion of the destruction of a person's life by anothet without any thought of the consequences, brought a different element into the story.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I know that Grandmothers don't typically listen to Rap, but really he is just awesome.<br />The lyrics had real meat to them and make a statement that is relevant. Usually I only like 1 or 2 songs on a CD, but every one of the songs on here is good. Some of the songs are just fun.<br />Truly he had me with &#34;Thrift Store&#34;, my 20 something daughter and I play it whenever we go thrift shopping!
B001EC3JME|4.0|after a while the straps do loosen up, but for the price I cant really complaint. The material is acceptable for the price. I mean it is a $8 holster, don't expect a bulletproof holster but it definitely does the job while it lasts.... mine is a bit loose but i just switched it to a different flashlight. problem solved.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Perfect game for kids of all ages, fast delivery too to your game system, grandson is very happy as am I....thanks
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This film is one of the best modern day zombie films yet, and that is clearly a fact. I wont give out huge spoilers, but the zombies in this film are greatly different than the ones we see in every other zombie film. The plot is amazing & original, and I greatly hope that either a second one comes out, or another jaw-dropping film like this comes out. Truly an outstanding experience.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|When buying this album I realized I wasn't Bruno Mars's target audience as a grown, professional man. Even still, I found this album to be strong all the way through. He seemed to put much care and thought into each track.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|A nice twist on the old Judge Dredd.. I would've gave it a 3 1/2. I enjoyed it . Well worth it.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Just finished Season Five.  Can't wait till Season Six shows up at my door in November.  And then, what will I do after that??
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is my 9 year old girls favorite app of all time. It is making her want to ride real horses!
B00E8B1358|3.0|Took a while for the story to pick up but it was a very good film. The sound wasn't that great but this is probably due to now having surround sound.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|I will give this rating because I love this kind of Music. I received my CDs within the estimated time frame - thanks to Amazon. I will recommend this 2-pieces CD to all of you who loves film music
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Any one who likes reading about Abraham Lincoln or any historical character, this book rivals none that I have ever read before.  It is entertaining, informative and written so one can understand all that was going on politically at the time of Lincoln's presidency.  Very good.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|A high suspense crime drama where the acting is phenomenal and it is another great movie from director Martin Scorsese.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Love Star  Trek.  Lost my first DVD of this movie.  This is a replacement.  Can't wait for the new one to be out.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Good first few chapters, but that's all I could get through. Not like the show after that. Couldn't hold my attention.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|The disclaimer that pops up prior to the 3D movie playing states that a few scenes were recorded in 2D on purpose. From what I could see, only 1/2 of the movie was 3D and what was 3D wasn't a qualitiy 3D effect like I saw in the 3D Avatar or Thor.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It seems to work pretty well and is relativly fast to load videos.<br />I do occasionally get a bug where the screen blinks on and off rapidly when trying to view or leave a comments.<br />Hopefully they can fix this bug.<br /><br />Seeing how there is no official YouTube app for the Kindle Fire (as of the writing of this) it seems to be the best alternative.<br /><br />I purchased the full version which is supposed to allow viewing of videos at 1080p, but I have only been able to view at 720p. I've contacted the developer, but they haven't had an answer for me.
B0064J6OMO|4.0|watched with my husband.  we both laughed.  definitely something in there for both of us!  very real and fun.  would watch again.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It's bad enough that you can just view every post from your friends in order of the time it's posted, but now you can no longer edit or delete a post. When you long press on the comment you are presented with a blank menu popup which DOES NOTHING!!<br />Please fix this and leave it alone!!
B006UUK612|4.0|awesome flick.  great to show my child.  enjoyed seeing it again after many years.  the movies of the 80's rock.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this was a great book. Very well written. I truly appreciated the character development and action adventure plot.
B00EQUP3Q6|2.0|I am baffled by the multitude of 5 star reviews that this is receiving.<br />5 stars signifies perfection; a classic. Hesitation Marks is hardly either.<br />I, Like many other fans here, feels the need to preface this (obviously) negative review by proclaiming \\"I am a huge/die-hard NIN fan\\". I feel obligated to start with this as I am almost ashamed to be writing anything other than a glaringly positive review for Trent Reznor/NIN.<br />They have had such enormous influence on me over the past 20+ years; writing anything other than praise feels blasphemous.<br /><br />That said, as a music lover and someone who has tremendous respect and admiration for not only Trent's music, but his both lyrical and musical consistency and general approach to the industry too, I am deeply disappointed by \\"Hesitation Marks\\".<br /><br />Why exactly? Well, there are a myriad of reasons, many of which are quite subjective so I will share my thoughts on only what I feel most NIN fans would agree with:<br /><br />1) Let's be honest here...a healthy, jacked, married and overall happy Trent is great for Trent but not so great for NIN or the fans. NIN was built on ANGST. Every single album, starting from PHM and leading up to (and including With Teeth), were pure, unadulterated expressions of Trent's hatred, frustration and annoyance with much of what surrounded him in his world, and we as fans deeply identified with this and ultimately empathized with his \\"situation\\". As much as I hate to say it, a happier Trent correlates with not-so- interesting music. There has been a noticeable and sharp decline in the quality of the Industrial music he has produced, post With Teeth (which I know many disliked, but I thought was still solid). Note that I specify \\"industrial\\" as he has done incredible things in the electronica/ambient/soundtrack-space, which has been more reliant on his ability to create lush atmospherics and less about writing emotive, anger-driven lyrics/music.<br /><br />2) As for the album itself, it's just boring. It's sound like the B-sides to Year Zero and The Slip. A forced effort that is ultimately monotonous, one-dimensional and uninspired. In fact, it is the anti-thesis of what NIN is known for and essentially what they invented: the perfect slow-build. In my honest opinion, no one layers/constructs songs as masterfully as Trent Reznor. When listening to HM it doesn't even sound like NIN but rather some sort of minimalist, electronica-based side-project. Don't get me wrong, I admire progression, creativity and risk-taking by musicians. However, when you remove the multidimensionality that is so integral and inherent in most NIN songs and replace it with minimalist glitch/blips and bleeps, you are moving away from the original \\"formula\\" and creating a new animal altogether.<br /><br />3) Even though the above (to me) was sufficient reasoning on my part to be disappointed by this album, I still couldn't quite put my finger on why Hesitation Marks felt like such an unwelcome departure from NIN's older material. As a result, I decided to (try) and not hastily write this review and listen to the album a good number of times to figure out what for me, was missing. I finally realized that the answer was really quite simple: THERE ARE NO GUITARS (and please do not tell me that \\"Everybody\\" contains guitars...that songs needs to be taken out back and put out of its misery). NIN is a fiercely guitar-driven band. Driving, distorted, crunchy guitar riffs are what give NIN songs their backbone, their substance. There may be a strum here and there on HM, but nothing that would musically resemble anything NIN has produced in the past. Further, there are minimal to no live drums here as well. WTF?? I am dumbfounded as to how this genius could deliberately leave out the hallmarks of his band and legacy. In the end though,  all of my analysis (and annoyance) here is moot, as we are no longer discussing industrial rock but electronica. As such, I think Ihave to just accept that Trent has morphed into an electronica-producer, and from here forward, judge him based on his work in this genre, relative to others in the space.I have tremendous respect for Trent and will continue to support and listen to, whatever the heck it is he decides to put out.<br /><br />In the end, you know what the best thing about Hesitation Marks is? That it puts the band back on the road.<br /><br />I'll see you at the show \m/(>_<)\m/.
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|NIN new album is a mix of a little old and a little new. Some of the people who wanted this album to sound like Downward Spiral will be a bit disappointed, but there are some really great songs and you can tell that Trent had fun. This is another great NIN album to add to your collection.

0345548981|5.0|I'd pretty much buy anything by Novak Djokovic as I'm a huge admirer of his, but I guess this book is not so much about the man himself but a life-changing experience that everyone should read. It doesn't matter if you are an athlete or not, many people suffer a celiac desease without knowing, much like it happened to Novak. At least this book will enlighten a lot of people about the changes in diet that can lead to a healthier, more fulfilling life. I recently discovered i was intolerant to gluten and I must thank Novak for that. He's always been a great role model for people and I value that he takes his time to share his findings with all of us. Number 1 on and off the court.<br /><br />However it must be said that some reviews make it sound like Novak became this amazing champion just by changing his diet and this could be missleading. It's true Novak had many allergies and ailments before that impeded him to compete at the highest level all the time, but let's not forget he was already n#3 in the world for many years and already a winner of one slam at the tender age of 22. It wasn't a transformation from one day to the next as some make it to be. I understand it might help sell more books but the truth is that without his talent and skills, it doesn't matter how well you eat. And it's highly exaggerated that \\"he barely could complete a tournament before\\". What the heck? he won many titles previous to his fantastic 2011 season, so he was perfectly capable of competing at the highest level and win titles with or without gluten.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|The game is okay when you finally get to play it, but there is a ton of garbage to wade through first.  This is primarily a marketing tool.  Pass.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|Having served in Viet-Nan I saw many men that had the same personalities as were portrayed by Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen.  This iis what made the film so realistic.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Despite leading a full life, I have become addicted to this dang movie! I initially watched it for the wit and musical numbers - still do. Now, however, I am trying to sort out who sings what part during the 10 (not kidding) part harmony numbers. The leads are all great but, before becoming a PP geek, I had no idea that Ester Dean was such a huge force in the music industry or that Kelly Jakie was on 'The Sing-Off' for two seasons. If you sing, the quality of voices and mash ups are amazing. If nothing else, it is a great way to blow 2 hours!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I was hooked on this series from the first episode.  The only drawback is that when I identify with a certain character,he or she gets killed off.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just as engrossing as the first book of this trilogy; Ken Follett lures the reader into the story. I'm looking  forward to the third installment!

B008602KQI|5.0|Nice movie. Very different concept and very well screenplayed. Enyoyed watching. Especially the climax with the wild jaguar fight was great
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has a quick pace to it. The imagination of the author is one if a very unique perspective. This is not some generic, techie, sci-fi(ish) type of book. Well worth the read. Thank you Ernest Cline.

B0053O89KG|5.0|I have just started watching Castle reruns on TNT and have been pleasantly surprised on how good this show is. Now I'm addicted and my DVR is working overtime to catch up.  During the course of watching these episodes, I have notice some fairly big names that has made guest appearances.  I don't want to get into a new season without being completely caught up on the romance and murder plot of Becketts mom.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|I bought this product to store my SD cards that I have laying around the house. I find that this helps organize them and keep them together.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|When this movie was advertised, apparently I thought like most Americans and had no desire to see it in theaters. It's estimated cost of $50 million was not recouped by about $15 million. That's globally speaking. After seeing the movie last night through Prime, I have to say that I wish I saw it in a theater.<br /><br />The movie is violent, with quite a lot of CGI used to depict the gory effects of projectiles and gravity. I like the no nonsense attitude of Dredd in the movie, and I like Karl Urban in the role. The female roles were well played, though I had to force myself to accept the villain was as fierce as she was supposed to be.<br /><br />Dredd is seemingly immune to the harshness of the world around him and is 100% driven by his sense of right and wrong, which is the law and order that is supposed to govern citizens. I feel like without the law for him to view the world through he would be aimless. Anyway, the plot is moderately thick, leaving the viewer a lot of room to fill in voids, but not so shallow that it's a struggle to fill the voids. None of the characters are deeply changed through the course of the film, unless you count going from alive to dead as character change. Dredd learns that sometimes things aren't \\"black and white,\\" so to speak. Anderson is simply exposed to the harsh world of being a judge and living with the decisions she must make. She seems to be comfortable making those decisions by the end.<br /><br />Dredd offers viewers visceral action with a good enough plot, deep enough characters for an action movie, and only a little post-processing to make sense of things. To me, those are the ingredients for a good action movie!
0307266303|4.0|This was a great read.  I switched to Vibram five finger runners 18 months ago, so this was a great reaffirmation of why I can run so much better on trails.  Also a good motivator for an aging athlete.  The book was ultimately readable and had very interesting human/animal evolution/biology perspective
140006922X|5.0|Definitely an interesting and entertaining read.  For those of you looking to expand your knowledge of this particular era, it's a great place to start.  As a Christian I've always felt ignorant about Jesus' life and the era in which he lived.  I've learned more from this book than I ever did reading the gospels or going to church.  I don't find it offensive at all.  I do find offensive some of the so-called \\"Christian\\" responses to this (Islamic) author's work.  It's undeserved not to mention racist.  And no true Christian would ever act that way, nor speak out that way against someone else.  Shame on those who have.  You give Christianity a bad name.
B005ZCH9FC|5.0|I love this film so much, I saw it at the cinema and purchased this dvd for my father. It's so cute, inspiring and moving. You'll laugh out loud and also probably cry - and thoroughly enjoy every moment of it.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Enjoyed Fall of the Giants so purchased the second book Winter of the World to follow the saga through and am awaiting the final part of the trilogy to be published.to see how the families finish up.

B0049GYXDQ|5.0|I've seen this movie before and I really liked it, so I bought a nice Blue-ray copy.  Shipping was fast and reliable and the product arrived as described.  Definitely a must-have for any Disney fan.
B0085OELXK|3.0|I would give the original foreign version five stars. The ending was much better. So were the characters. I believed them, here they seem out of place and fabricated. This version was more visually stunning must have cost much more money to make. Those are its only redeeming qualities. If you have not seen the original movie, watch it.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Was not particularly fond of the way the series was put together on the discs with the repeating of everything over and over again.  I am a big fan on Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's work so was not disappointed in that regard.  Navigation was the problem.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|A futuristic movie that didn't go over that well with me. Pretty much guessed what would happen next and less that mid-way through figured out that the people were being manipulated; but to what end?
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love the characters and the story line.  It has suspense, good stories and humor.  Garbriel Macht is pretty easy on the eyes too.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I enjoyed this movie as it was fun to watch. The beginning was a bit mashed up and rushed. It was a bit long, I got bored by the end. I didn't like the \\"new\\" music selections.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read Wool in one sitting and the second I finished it I immediately purchased the Wool Omnibus. I read that every spare moment until I finished it and then bought all the Dust books [Dust (Silo Saga)].<br />I rarely review books because I read a ton I don't have the time to review everything I read. I'm also pretty picky about my 5 star reviews and I rarely write them. This was absolutely worth it.<br />This is superbly written. The descriptive passages are flawless. You can imagine every rivet of the silo that is the setting. The characters are so completely alive. And Hugh Howey is an absolute MASTER at creating tension in a scene. I actually tensed up reading parts of this and literally held my breath during a scene involving a water-filled stairwell. Seriously- I braced my legs on my chair arm reading that scene and the whole book is that good.<br />This will be a permanent resident on my Kindle. I hooked my husband on it and he hasn't pulled his nose out of his Kindle in 5 hours. An absolute must read!
B00DU74U74|4.0|I liked the movie but I though that it could use more light and better actors... The movie followed the movie amazingly and the only flaws that I can think of are the ones that I already listed.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|This is where we meet Zephram Cochran, played by the very tall James Cromwell, and his buddy who is played by Alfre Woodard, one of my favorite actresses. It's classic ST:TNG, so if you like the series you'll like this movie. I am a huge fan, so I loved it.

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I really waited for a new Gaiman book bit it is a bit too gloomy and less fun.<br />Gaiman should have put some more effort ( We all know he can!).
B00DLKXF3A|2.0|To me, it sounds like a collection of B-sides that they've collected over the years that never made it onto albums. At least tell us that before we run out and buy the CD! I've been a loyal fan and purchased every CD these guys have made. This SO pales in comparison to all their previous work -- meaningless lyrics, mindless arrangements, nothing that stands out at all, especially for them.<br />Sorry, but this is a definite thumbs down! Listen online before you buy!!!
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|There are a couple songs on here I'm not big on (Everything to name one), but for the most part this is a very solid album. In Two and While I'm Still Here are probably my favorite songs on the album right now. I also like All Time Low for its disco style and Satellite for being released in a time dominated by news of Assange/Snowden. Long story short, there are songs that stick out right away and others that are growing on me with each listen (seems to be a theme with most NIN work).<br /><br />I also love how Trent places certain sounds into this album that pay respect to some of his earlier works. It left me wanting to listen to this album along with the old stuff.<br /><br />I know there are some long time NIN fans who don't care for this album much, but I think the vast majority of NIN fans (young and old) will enjoy this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just wonderful. It is a great time passer and makes me laugh all the time. just wish that you could convert bananas into tokens. :P
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game  a lot of extra details to figure out but once u understand the general Idea it's fun and addictive .  It reminds me of SIM city game on Nintendo from years ago.
B000JY8F22|5.0|Since my first time watching Closer years ago, I've been hooked. Renting it from the library wasn't cutting it anymore and it was no where to be found on the shelves in stores. A must have movie! Thanks Amazon!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is not the book to read. Much like Gone Girl, Flynn takes us to places where this is such pain and ugliness. I enjoyed the many levels to this book, the back and forth of guilt.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|A couple of years ago, I came across Ariana Grande's YouTube channel which has her singing cover versions of different songs, and I just completely fell in love with her voice. The cover that stood out the most was Adele's 'Rolling In The Deep'. In September of last year, she released a cover of Mariah Carey's hit song, 'Emotions'. I watched the video and was absolutely blown away! Ariana Grande's voice is beautiful, and so very powerful! I couldn't believe my ears. Ever since then, I have been waiting for Ariana to release her own material. With that being said, 'Yours Truly' does not disappoint.<br /><br />All of the songs on 'Yours Truly' show off Ariana's powerful voice. I love that I can listen to the album without skipping any songs, but my favorites are Lovin' It, Baby I, Daydreamin', and You'll Never Know. Most of the songs give you a 90's throwback type of feeling, and there are beautiful ballads as well.<br /><br />I believe that Yours Truly is the album of the year. Ariana is going to easily outshine her fellow peers with this album. If you are having any doubts about purchasing this CD, please don't. Ariana Grade will not disappoint. She has such raw talent, and she does not need any gimmicks or drama to draw any buzz around herself. Her raw talent and beauty is going to take her very far!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|What if there are alternate worlds we live in? Is this life we are living real or are we living a hologram? A book with so much intrigue, action and travel around the world. Very satisfying.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|This movie took forever to download! I think my Wi-Fi could be partly to blame but pretty much by the time the download was complete and i got a chance to see the movie, the rental period was over.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|There is a bit of repetitiveness in some of the tracks that seems to be characteristic of TSFH; I was honestly hoping to see Bergersen distance himself from at least a portion of the same formula that he has used in the past, but there is no denying that this is a very strong album from him.  My favorite tracks are Sonera and Aura, I love cranking this up for some serious gym and landscaping work!
B000000XBC|5.0|Have most of these selections on albums I bought many years ago, and the sound quality is wonderful. Hear things I never did before. I have an older CD copy of Chronicles 1 that doesn't have the sonic quality like this one does. I will have to purchase a newer release of that one next. I am 61 so I have enjoyed listening to CCR for a while.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Entertaining and funny.  It might be a little gory for some, but it is all in fun.  It was a little predictable, and there were a couple slow scenes, but overall it was a good movie.  If you are like me and hate all the zombie movies, be sure to watch this one.
0345428064|3.0|Book 1, in the Nick Stone series<br /><br />Since I am a huge fan of action thrillers I was excited starting another series that promises lots. The Nick Stone Missions are based on the author's own experiences in the SAS (Special Air Service) and each book follows the character Nick Stone as a paid mercenary after working for the SAS, British Intelligence and an American agency.<br /><br />\\"Remote Control\\" starts on a very slow note and takes time before it picks up the paced and becomes quite fast-paced and captivating. This is definitely a thriller not meant to please the faint hearted, we have a lot of violence and it is graphically brutal. This blistering story is told from the point of view of a very complex protagonist and where he gets in motion we have very exciting moments. The writing is sharp and clearly dramatic although I did find the author to go overboard detailing every move, it was too repetitive at times. At some point the story strays towards the unbelievable although way too farfetched I still kept rooting for his success and he did not disappoint.<br /><br />The novel is an interesting insight into the world of a fictional spy, the story of a rogue Special Air Service agent on the lam in suburban America with the seven year old daughter of a murdered colleague, dragging the spunky youngster from one seedy motel to another, stuffing her with junk food and teaching her the fine art of espionage.<br /><br />My first experience with this author was a good one and I am looking forward to read \\"Crisis Four\\".
0525953728|4.0|This books accomplishes its limited purposes extremely well:  the author gives a vivid picture of what it is like to be a Navy SEAL and of how the Bin Laden mission was accomplished.  Whether or not some details were fudged for national security purposes is not clear, but the narrative seems to be very plausible and persuasive.<br /><br />The author (using Owen as his pseudonym) was the elite of the elite.  Much like professional athletics, hundreds were winnowed out in the process of placing Owen into the top team.  Like elite baseball players, the SEALS make a career of it, training year round and conducting missions over the space of more than a decade.  The skill set they need is far more demanding than that of an athlete -- they need to be in phenomenal physical shape, plus work as a team, plus have the extraordinary intelligence and instinct necessary to survive in a crisis, plus have the discipline and experience necessary to kill without being killed.  It's no accident that Tiger Woods injured himself trying to train with a group of special forces friends.  These guys are the true professional athletes and are envied by people like Woods.<br /><br />All of which brings to mind another anecdote:  reporters asked Manager Ralph Houk if he was nervous before his first World Series managerial stint in 1961.  Houk, a decorated combat officer during the Normandy campaign, replied:  \\"Why, will someone be shooting at me?\\"  Our culture is geared around celebrating the physical, mental, and teamwork skills of ballplayers as well as their courage in the arena -- but the true professionals are the elite forces who don't earn any celebrity or material rewards.<br /><br />I won't ruin the suspense by describing how the Bin Laden raid went down.  The account here is excellent.  While Owen tells the story of much more difficult operations, a lot went wrong during the Bin Laden raid, and the team did an excellent job of adjusting.<br /><br />Perhaps as a result on his unwillingness for security purposes to reveal too much about himself, the book does not give a lot of insight into Owen's character and sometimes comes off as cliched.  He makes a few gratuitous political observations that I found to be irritating.  There seems to be a sense in this country that celebrities or real life heroes like Owen have some kind of special standing to talk politics or some kind of special insight.  They really don't.<br /><br />In sum, a very good narrative.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the most amazing books I've ever read!!! Kept me on my toes, always wanting more. I almost wish it would never end.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My son and I started out with the movie and then got excited again when the second movie came out. He is now 9 and decided he was ready to read the series (he reads a lot).  He flew through this book, and the next two.  He is starting the fourth in the morning.  He wanted me to go back and start reading them out loud so we could discuss them.  I've really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to start the second.  Love the mythology tied into modern times, enough history to get you talking about the gods and enough action to keep you asking for more!
1573229725|4.0|I enjoyed [[ASIN:1573221368 Tipping the Velvet]], and so was excited to read this book, reputed to be the author's best. And Fingersmith is a fun read, with a gripping plot and well-developed characters. It's also darker than Tipping the Velvet, in a fairly lurid way (I'm not talking about the sex, of which there isn't much), and the plot doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.<br /><br />Fingersmith is one of those books you won't want to read too many reviews about before diving in, lest they spoil the surprises that are half the fun. It begins with a young thief, Sue, who joins a plot to swindle an heiress out of her fortune. This being a Sarah Waters book, attraction develops between Sue and the heiress and.... you'll have to read it to find out the rest! The book had me staying up much later than I'd intended to find out what happens next, which had not happened to me for awhile. Certainly a lot of fun.<br /><br />The plot is also the source of some problems, however. The first big twist set very high expectations, which the rest of the story failed to meet, and the rationale behind that twist doesn't make much logical sense, as it's hard to see how that course of events would benefit anyone. There are also a few other problems of the \\"why doesn't she just....?\\" variety. Meanwhile, some of the misfortunes with which Waters torments her heroines are just so absurd that I couldn't even feel bad for them (and I wanted to! I had a soft spot for these crazy girls. Especially Maud, who seriously needs a therapist). To be fair, Tipping the Velvet has its over-the-top elements as well and I suspect that for many of Waters's fans this is a feature rather than a bug; Fingersmith has been called \\"Dickensian,\\" and Dickens was no stranger to melodrama (I say this as someone who mostly likes Dickens). Finally, while the slow pacing and attention to detail work well at the beginning to develop the setting and characters, later in the book this drags the plot down, leaving too few pages for the rushed resolution.<br /><br />All that said, the book still has a lot going for it. The writing style is fluid and Waters does a great job with atmosphere and period detail. The book explores the seamy underbelly of Victorian society, from abusive asylums where inconvenient women could be locked away for years, to the sale of pornography (yep, the Victorians were hypocrites). The character development, particularly of the two protagonists, is very good, and Waters uses the dual first person narration to great effect. You really get a sense of how the narrators think differently, in subtle ways, and revisiting some of the same events with a different set of eyes is occasionally humorous and consistently fascinating. On a couple of occasions I wanted to say \\"But that isn't how it happened!\\" only to realize.... wait a minute.... everyone is unreliable, and everyone tends to view events in the light most favorable to themselves.

The writing style is fluid and Waters does a great job with atmosphere and period detail. The book explores the seamy underbelly of Victorian society, from abusive asylums where inconvenient women could be locked away for years, to the sale of pornography (yep, the Victorians were hypocrites).

B00AKYRCNY|4.0|My 2 1/2 yr old son played this puzzle for a good 15 minutes on my kindle; he loves planes, trains, trucks, etc.<br />After a few puzzles a screen pops up wanting you to buy more puzzles, so that was a little annoying.  The puzzles each contain only 3 pieces, but they do have sound for each piece which was nice.  Glad this was FREE, and if it had more than 3 pieces on each play I might actually have paid for the additional puzzles.....<br />4 stars because it did not have more than 3 pieces per play.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Not only this was a great movie to watch but also it was one the most touching movie that I had ever watched.

I have already planned to extend the idea that the movie presented, to much wider areas of Family and social values.<br /><br />Alireza Jazayeri<br />President & CEO<br />National Foundation for Preserving Family Values

B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I watched this whole season in just two days.  Couldn't stop watching it.  I think this was one of the best Dexter seasons ever.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|Trent Reznor should just release an album with a new title, new artwork, and new song titles. But instead of actual new material, it should all just be the songs from The Downward Spiral.<br /><br />It can be called There You Go, ****heads.<br /><br />After all, it's what everyone wants.<br /><br />I remember the day I bought The Downward Spiral. My first thought after hearing it was, 'This sounds nothing like Broken'. And I returned it the next day when you could do those kinds of things.<br /><br />But eventually this is what I came to love about Trent 'Expect the Unexpected' Reznor. I picked up The Downward Spiral six months later after the singles grew on me, and now it's one of my favorite albums. And now I know that when I pick up a new Nine Inch Nails album, it's not going to sound like anything he did before.<br /><br />There are several things Trent Reznor does better than most musicians. He doesn't replicate himself. He always tries something new. He is neither ahead of his time, dated, or keeping up with trends: he has his own sound that is always evolving and difficult for copycats to keep up with. And has anyone seen the instruments he uses to make his music? I never knew what the hell a swarmatron was until Trent Reznor started using one.<br /><br />Hesitation Marks does not disappoint. Somehow he managed to throw his listeners off his scent once more. You're probably already familiar with the singles from the album, and I believe the reception that 'Everything' has received has been undeservingly negative. It's not what it appears to be on the surface. And many of the songs on Hesitation Marks are similar in that way.<br /><br />I think we live in a time where a track by track breakdown is unnecessary. You can listen to the samples. You can hear everything on YouTube. In fact, this review is probably not even being read. But if you are reading this, then that means you're like me in the sense that maybe you needed a different perspective and something to think about. So let me just tell you this if you're on the fence about buying this album: This isn't The Downward Spiral. If you want The Downward Spiral, then just buy yourself another copy. But if you listen to Nine Inch Nails because you want something different and creative, this is a well written album in that respect. Some musicians, especially mainstream acts, keep shoveling the same **** into our ears album after album. Their hearts aren't even in it anymore. It's a business. The art is gone. Any musician can call up a hit-creating producer to write their album. But Trent Reznor always manages to give us something pure. Hesitation Marks is the kind of record most people are afraid to make because it's risky. But it's got integrity. That's what makes it so good.to think about.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a warm and heart warming story it's sad but it's life things happen for a reason and you just got to except that we don't have time to be mad at each other we need to get along life doesn't last forever there's only one of you. You gotta make your life count. What a wonderful amazing book sad but it's life did I get tears in my eyes yes but it makes you look differently at life and how you should live it. I recommend this amazing book to everyone I love it! There's so much more to say but I'll be done.
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|Hilarious but very expensive.  Are you serious 9.99  no popcorn no one talking in their phone to yell at wtf
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is addicting and awesome it's free and the controls are good and simple it's good to pass time too!! GET IT!! It's ok if you don't want it though
B00CS65JS2|4.0|I love their sound and the album has a great selection.  They are a good representation of the techno-pop genre.
B004478AS4|4.0|The plot was interesting and engaging but because of the unfamiliar names and places it was sometimes difficult to understand.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is both simple and deep.  Most people should be able to get through the levels without too much trouble, but completionists may find getting all the stars to be insane.  The cute aesthetic is a good fit, and the mechanics that get rolled out don't take away from the base concept.  Is less beholden to randomness than Angry Birds, and never gouges the player to keep playing like Candy Crush Saga does.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This movie is only good if you can set your feelings about the book aside and appreciate it for what it is, which is a love story with Dicaprio in it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I really love this app it's amazing and super fun. I wish things were cheaper on it though and the notifications are bit annoying. I also love the Doctor Whooves! But he's missing his tie. All together great app, little pricey, still awesome!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this cause I have everything on here that I can learn the words it is also teaches me what the word that I look up I would know the meaning behind it I would also be using this during school when I'm aloud to and for it to help me on my homework for school and this kindle fire helps me be more organized......
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This was a coming of age flick, which reminded me slightly of a mix between goonies and stand by me. I liked the culture and tone of the movie and the acting and directing were superb! It was not what I expected, actually based on the trailer, I am not sure what I expected! But it was better! I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a deep thinking, humorous, sundance type flick. Glad I rented it on a whim.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|There are so many ways to enjoy this classic mid-century sci-fi adaptation of Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\" - all of which are pretty breathtaking.  Naively, as I saw it around its first 1956 release, it's an exciting space opera with dirty little secrets and still very handsome special effects, and one of the eeriest scores ever (it has as much of a sonic fingerprint as \\"Psycho\\"). With a little more knowledge, it's a nice pulp streamlining of \\"The Tempest\\", and if Anne Francis doesn't get to say, \\"O brave new world that has such people in't...\\", she looks as if she could, and would. Robbie, of course, makes a splendid Ariel (also nice that he escapes the apocalypse to assist Will Robinson).<br />Beyond that, there's the tickle of \\"creation without instrumentality\\" and quite forgetting about the old Id. Caliban never had it so good (or more powerful).  Too bad those wedge-shaped Krell didn't leave a visual record - love to see a family snapshot.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Very interesting story line with a twist at the end.  Great photography. Liked everything about the flick.  Would recommend it to all ages.
B00CTT9646|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I had the $80 version preordered, but cancelled the order when I learned Paramount & Bad Robot were trying to force us to buy multiple copies (including downloaded copies -- ugh!) to obtain all the content. So now, I'll wait 6 months and pick up a used copy, just to have the movie. I wasn't that wild about the movie in the first place, and this cheesy marketing scam convinced me that I had better ways to spend $80. Sorry, Bad Robot!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really like it. The only problem I have is I wish it gave more direction where to HR next instead of having to hit hint constantly.
1451695195|5.0|It gave me hope that what I believed was there after life was actually there.  It was factual because it was written by a Neurosurgeon.
B005D4YGXK|4.0|I normally wear an 11 in standard shoes.  Before ordering, I looked at my old Keen's which are an 11-1/2 and fit me perfectly.  The new Keen's in that size were a half-size smaller, so I needed to return them for a 12 to get the same fit I had before.<br /><br />This seems to be true only of the Men's Keens.  My wife had to order a half-size SMALLER than usual to get the right fit...  Go figure.
0307352153|5.0|It explained several things about myself - uncomfortable feelings, wanting to leave occasions, concern for others and not wanting to be called on.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|just what I was looking for.  it does what it claims to do.  have issues with it on my kindle waking up to online music but that is a minor issue.  this has been my alarm clock for a few years now.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Good movie but a bit too long.  Loved the message to fathers and to all of us.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|This is by far the best rock album that I have heard in a real long time. This album sounds authentic and has a true rock & roll spirit to it. Rock is alive! Thank you Deep Purple!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Consistently written and acted characters, stories with a beginning middle and end make for a good ride. Better when watched back to back than with a weeks gap between shows.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Oscar Wilde has given us all a way to look inside our own inner monologues, he has brought to light what we won't speak out loud and the destruction that life altering actions can have on our own beings...an amazing read, excellent character development, with very interesting plot breaks to make use think of our own existences.
B00CLD671A|5.0|The best of the best - the type of programming that deserves more than 5 stars!  Cannot wait for Season 4.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I enjoyed being able to battle with something other than those annoying green pigs. I like the graphics, very colorful and interesting.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a treat! I enjoyed reading The Fault in our Stars for so many different reasons. The writing is brilliant. The dialogue is real and witty and poignant all at the same time. The story is not incredibly original in that there's a whole genre of YA books dedicated to the terminally-ill-star-cross lovers. What makes this story different and worthwhile are the voices of the characters, the imperfection of their personalities and the sheer acceptance of the notion that dying young sucks. John Green writes a story from the perspective of a terminally ill girl and succeeds at capturing her spirit. I found myself not caring as much about the plot of the story as about the people in it. I wanted to spend time with each of his characters and get to know them. I will read this book again, if anything, to spend a little more time savoring the language, understanding the details and visiting with old friends.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Great story and I felt the real need that the police to get to the root of a crime by looking for and finding that one piece in the puzzle.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I really enjoy the show - it is a mix of James Bond Suave with some great strong characters who keep the story line fascinating
B00511QI4A|4.0|A long book with a large number of different characters to remember as one reads it and i felt that one got a bit lost.  I felt that Jason just disappeared and Sid took over the story but I felt that there were too many sub plots and killings which detracted a bit from the story.  Unexpected twist at the end which could have been crafted better.  I felt left down at the end.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love Kate Morton books.  This one did not disappoint me at all.<br />As always it held my interest and I was eager to pick it up again and again.<br />Great story, I liked the background history and the ending was not<br />totally predicable.  The characters were interesting.<br />Good read.
B00D8WMASM|5.0|I'm a huge Jay Z fan and I love all the great music coming out from the genre but to me so far (Slim Shady is coming) J. Cole's work is the most complete from start to finish. Definitely worth the money.
B000ZELISO|5.0|A great movie it was the slowest Harry Potter well one of the slowest of the harry potter movies but its a great movie some people think differently and don't think its slow at all, it is quite metal at some points like i said a great movie.
0525478817|5.0|Appreciated the honesty and real way that Green handled the topic of cancer.  Cancer + being a teenager?  Double yikes.  Definitely shed some tears, but also laughed out loud.  Loved this book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Amazing how they managed to blend all the stories and individuals on one screen. Movie was great, one of my favorites.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Would not recommend - loads too much on to the machine and is slow, just wants to get you to buy worthless enhancement. Not for kids, not for adults - just product to sell more product.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|It's was amazing  Selena Gomez Did it again I was so happy when it came in the mail the album also comes with a free kindle version that includes  two more songs than the original album!;)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is nice to see program with a view of the turn of the Century 1900 and how people respected each other not only the Noblemen but their working class servants. Here we see Conservatives who look out for others, the working class, the towns people and the farmers. It's too bad that the modern day conservatives do not have the same respect for people that support them and work for them.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Very readable and a good page turner, although I did have an inkling as to the ending it did not spoil things.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i finished this game in about 15 minutes. It is very entertaining though. looking forward to more updates, hopefully coming soon.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I liked the music, could have a little less bass, but I liked it.  Sorry, but it also puts me to sleep. ha ha
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|How did I not know there is a forth in this series?! Really loved the risks Sylvia Day took with the characters. Gideon has proved he'll do anything to protect Eva, and this book doesn't disappoint. Can't wait for the next one!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, it has good values and I like that not every other character is gay. Mike can be a bit of a whiner some times. Harvey is great! 
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played. It's fun and challenging and I can't wait to try the other versions.
B001XUIBNO|4.0|My wife and I were looking for a classic movie on Amazon Prime that neither of us had seen. Chinatown fit the bill and we were glad that we chose it.  Although it was from 1974 it held up well.  We would recommend it.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book was interesting in that it enlightened me about what goes on in North Korea. Following six peoples/families' stories brought a &#34;real&#34; feel to it. In some ways, the book left me feeling depressed/helpless in a &#34;what can I do?&#34; sense. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about North Korea.
B00CEJ2H6K|4.0|One of the premiere metal bands is back.  This CD is a little different sounding than Sutur Rising.  Seems to have more straightforward thrash style riffing than they did in previous releases, but the classic AA sound is there.  Johan has great vocals, harsh yet not unintelligible which is a hard feat to accomplish.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really fun and entertaining game that can keep u happy for hours on end. I am truly happy with this game and it is fabulous!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|So I've done Tim's other two books, but this was the first one that I did completely.  After 9 months I was instructed to stop the diet because I'd lost all the wight I'd been trying to lose.  I'd lost 30+ pounds and nearly 5% body fat (that's a lot since I had only weighed 174 pounds before).<br /><br />While I acknowledge that I'm the target audience (male, 28-35) the book basically defines the hacking and testing methodology to changing your body.  Through the course of the 9 months I did the diet, workout, and supplements and each of them showing results.  While I'm halting the diet and have stopped the supplements after 3 months I'm continuing with the workouts and a modified version of the diet.<br /><br />Its an interesting read, but be warned that Tim's writing style can turn people off.  Oh and there is one section that just seems out of place, but interesting none-the-less.  Just be careful if reading it in public due to the pictures in this one section.
B007712XAU|5.0|What a fantastic series! My Mother and I started watching it together when I ordered seasons 1 and 2, and we fell in love immediately! The only bad part is that, at times, we couldn't stop ourselves from going onto the next episode immediately after finishing another!
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book has brought me back on the right track with my strength work-out. Paul Wade's approach is very straightforward and utterly honest. The advantages of calistenics have been laid out in plain words to prove that all the hype about modern fitness techniques is just bull-shitake. You don't really need to lift weights or use any of that fancy hi-tech equipment - your own body is your gym. That's liberating. I practise everywhere - in the park, on the sidewalk, at home. No excuses.<br /><br />I love the way the author guides you through the ten steps required to master each of the Big Six excercises. Each step is meticulously explained in every little detail. You simply can't get it wrong. And you can feel and see the results almost immediately. I consider myself quite fit, having strong background in athletics and judo, however, some of the excercises really kick ass... I am not sure if I ever reach any of the Master Steps, but it's definitely worth trying :)<br /><br />My advice for you is to follow the sequence of the 10 steps for each move right from the beginning, although this may seem ridiculous or just plain easy at a first glance (wall push-ups are a good example). Don't jump to step 3 or 4 just because you're feeling strong enough. If done in a proper way, even the simplest of the excercises described in the book may be excruciating and above all they really do a lot of good to prepare the body for more advanced work-out.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Works as documented. Excellent features. Excellent engine to help typing. I can not think of any feature that is missing
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|MTV definitely had its sticky fingers in this movie, it has that \\"feel\\" to it. Wasn't worth $5, but whatever.
B008518MOW|5.0|The whole family loved the movie. 3D effects were great as was the rest of the movie. I hope we can expect a MIB4!
B009CPIR9K|5.0|This is exactly what I thought it would be and I loved it. It is one of the most fun movies I have seen in a while.
1452113432|5.0|I love this book. It has so many recipies that I want to try. Well written and fun. It is easy to read and comprehend the recipies, can't wait to start.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is about as good as a zombie story a person can hope for. I like the development of the cast throughout the seasons and the third season is the best one so far.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|the sleeve fits perfectly with my kindle.  hope they have more great deals like i got.  the color could be better, but i still love it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Can't get enough of the game of thrones series.  I can't stand waiting for the next book. 2 years REALLY? Started watching the HBO series then went to the books.  I highly recommend as a very good read.  Enjoy!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is the bomb I play it in my free time and it has very good definition.  All though it does stop working time to time and you have to pay to get half of your stuff
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|You need to watch it ASAP, maybe don't even buy it, just get NetFlix and watch it ASAP...like get it NOW!!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I saw the movie and decided to read the boom. I think i enjoyed the movie more but they are both still amazing. I have read reviews about  the book and the movie  and alot of them say mortal instruments is like twilight and the host and tons of other books. I agree with this but i think its great. Its like every movie or book ive enjoyed put into one. Dont always look at books and think oh twilight already did this so this book isnt as good. Now its like you cant have a book without a girl deciding over two boys and i personally like this. I cant wait to read the next one
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Fast read. Very exciting.<br /> Would read them a 3rd time! I loved all the characters in the book.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I have the full version so now I have all the full versions to all the salon games!<br />I am like the luckiest girl on earth now
630420065X|4.0|Tom Cruise was awesome in this movie. It was very suspenseful and I never get tired of watching it. I liked this better than the others.
159562015X|5.0|I really liked this book. I took the online assessment and read and highlighted the book. I think finding my top 5 strengths will help guide me in my career. I look forward to applying my prescribed Ideas for Action to my professional life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the shocking and tragic twists make for a wonderful plot. This is a must read, but not for younger children.

B004SH40BQ|4.0|I purchased this to go with my Motorola Bluetooth headphones since my iPod doesn't have Bluetooth.  It was easy to figure out & it works great.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have received several emails asking about compatibility with specific devices.  I can only speak to how the device works with my equipment (the aforementioned headphones).  Questions regarding compatibility should be directed to the manufacturer.

B0039TD7PY|5.0|This a reprisal of a concert they did together 30 yr ago. This is a CD of them doing the very same songs they did at that same theater years ago. (The modern concert has been aired on cable TV and you can see the fun they're having and the strong friendship they've shared over the years. as you watch them.) Whether you like either of them or both of them, you will certainly appreciate their contribution to the folk/ballad genre and want this in your collection.
B00821OX98|5.0|It starts off doing a lot of story and character building, but it definitely turns into a great story. Its been since the Star Gate series that I have found myself eager to watch any main stream Science Fiction.
1469984202|5.0|Awesome book. Sucked you in from the beginning. You got to know the characters and makes it easy to imagine how this could really happen.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|This movie was not quite as funny as I thought it was going to be. It was definitely a politically motivated movie. I think politics and political opinions are fine, but I don't particularly care for kids' movies that have the sole purpose of being politically preachy.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I love love pink floyd never disappoints. It's perfectly fine and of course the DVD worked great! I love it
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|This is the original and it's pretty different from the Disney rendition. If you're interested in original stories that many movies are based off of, this is one of them.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderful book. It swept me to another world, wrapped me with stories of people and their depths. A must read.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|I focused on the message...it is about a family.  What is there to learn from this?<br />Could use less sex and more moments for teaching children.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I just watched this movie 15 minutes later. Its mind blowing... I love to watch iron man from my childhood days... I always wanted to be like him... I just love him... <3
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read this book. It kept me turning pages, guessing at every turn and I loved the smart and thoughtful writing.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Don't bother with this one! It works for awhile, then gives problems, finally completely dies. Go look for something else.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I went to see this with my kids, with the only expectation that when it got too boring I could quietly slip on my iPod earbuds and listen to a book.  Instead, I laughed for over an hour.  The movie was fun, silly, heartwarming and a great way to spend a couple hours with my boys. We still talk about the movie.  It's not serious drama, but isn't meant to be.  In the same way, Monty Python isn't Shakespeare - there is a time and place for both.  Just grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy.  Note:  The M. Python reference is for silliness not borderline content - this movie has nothing bad, but still isn't \\"sugary sweet\\".  My elem school aged boys loved it.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Can't get this to work at all on my Kindle Fire (1). Install went fine and then it just locked up. Had to uninstall.
1444710338|4.0|I designed my diet using the program in Dr. Dukan's book and I have lost about 24 lbs so far.  I hope to lose quite a bit more.  I like it because it is protein-centric... much like the Atkins plan, but it removes fats and hard alcohol as free foods.  it has a quick-start phase, a long-term phase design to systematically remove weight.  One of the things that I like about it is that It recognizes that weight lost is not permanent without some sort of behavioral change, so it has an additional &#34;consolidation phase&#34; where no weight loss is intended. but that weight is retained.  this phase is longer than the weight loss phase.  and it finally has a permanent phase where you can eat what you want, but with only a few easy to follow rules.<br /><br />it's not for everyone, because fats, sugars, and alcohols are purged from the diet (and only minimally returned during the consolidation phase).  The book itself is a british translation of a french book, so the language is awkward at times... and it has a distinct french bias (for example, he recommends drinking french perrier water over italian pelligrino water).  Another downside is that I see difficulties in eating out.<br /><br />I like it because I can plan where I'm at. I also like it because I'm returning to basic brown-bagging.  I am saving a ton of money not eating out for lunch and limiting restaurants at dinner time, too.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Both storyline and art work have been given an unusual amount of attention for a free game. I expected to find myself blocked from progress by a need to pay to unlock new levels, but with a little patience and strategy it seems possible to access everything for free.<br /><br />Primarily a hidden object game, but with some puzzles and a bit of strategy thrown in to keep it interesting. Recommended!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Actually, I think that this book is better than its movie. As is quite often the case, written material leaves more to one's imagination.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's the best game I ever played in the world<br /><br />The people on it are so cool looking
0062511408|4.0|the book is in fine condition and ,as far as I know. it is bestseller.The book is a must for readers that like good meaningful stories .Readers not only enjoy it  but they have the opportunity to reflect on their dreams, goals and aspirations in life. This book is to keep and read a couple of times.Every time one reads it one finds new meanings.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Another good read from Michael Connelly. It took me awhile to get used to Michael being on the other side. He adjusted quite well (or I did!), so I really enjoyed the book.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|This is definitely a great movie will be watching it many more times still have even after this long from having purchased it.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This is a great book for all ages and it is one life changing, eye opening book. I reccomend this book to everyone!
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  I had no idea what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by the history of Sound City.  And it all happened right here in my backyard in Southern California.  It definitely revealed the passion for quality sound that the founders originally had in mind.  It really blew my mind to find out the names that recorded at this studio.  I was really impressed with Dave Grohl's involvement with the documentary and his love for Sound City.  I especially enjoyed learning about the history of &#34;the board&#34; and that Dave Grohl put it to good use in his new studio - Studio 606 - by recording with many of the Sound City artists.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|IT KEEPS YOU TRYING TO COMPLETE THE GAME!! MY GRANDSON KEEPS ME TRYING TO CARRY ON!! TO GET THE PIGS!!!
B000AP04FG|5.0|this is a romantic comedy which masquerades as an action movie.  It is actually about a couple working things out despite the fact that they are shot at at the time.  Beautiful chemistry by Brad and Angelina as the couple who are married but really don't know each other.  Very satisfying film to watch!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Woman learning  to trust again after suffering abusive relationships with first her father then her husband.  Getting away from him after he is jailed for what he had been doing to her for years, his jail break and finding her again, learning to trust, accept that she is a worthy person and that a town can accept and appreciate her.  Worthy reading.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good read. All characters came together. Interesting story. Would recommend  I had a hard Tim putting it down. Good for book clubs
B008XG1X18|4.0|Just got pinterest and love to skim though friends boards or look on other people repins. It's so helpful with home remedies or great recipes or sites to go on. It's like having a online index magazine of combined sites with all the juicy information shared from multiplies of people with the same interest as you. Also its like a library of information; tips; receipes; jokes; and all sorts of unusual things. I don't know why I did'nt get it a long time ago.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a good game to pass the time, no question about that. The rules are also quite simple.<br />Gxbgdgfsbnv Cobb h  :( n :) :)  n  g Nguyen  high :) gfgcjvbnhcj n hnh
