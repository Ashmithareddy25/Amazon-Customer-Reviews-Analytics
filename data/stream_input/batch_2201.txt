B00571F26Y|5.0|A lot to consider.  Great research to back up claims.  We have serious detrimental side effects, from, wheat, gluten, even where wheat is in lipstick and hair products.  Feel great off wheat!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very user friendly....I had no trouble using from day 1. The 2 week forecast is helpful for planning events.<br />I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is like the best game graphics are AMAZING!.Would.recommend it! You are missing out if you do not have this game. If you like temple run you will like this game!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Don't miss all of the scenes they take out to fit the US time slot on PBS!  Purchase the FABULOUS UK Version of 3rd Season!!!  I now have all 3 seasons in the UK Versions and I LOVE IT!!  Purchase it!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I like how they made the characters have different abilities and like how they mixed up the levels. Still working on this game... I need to get 3 stars on so many levels on this. lol
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow. This book had me on edge since the beginning, I couldn't stop reading! But I will say that the end really surprised me. Can't wait to read the third book.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|I didn't really play this game too much to give it a fair rating... but what i did play of it, i enjoyed.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book kept me up at night waiting to see what was going to happen next. Great characters. Great read.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was absolutely afflicting!  I could not put it down. Great story, suspense at every turn. Already downloaded the next book.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed it a lot, more than watching the movie. I really recommend it to see a different perspective of a person with trauma.
1423136802|5.0|I love that these were easy to rder and came on time. They look great at my 7 year old cant wait to start on them!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|This never worked out for me.  I originally had it on  my computer and used it a lot actually.  I used it to put articles and things aside until I could get to them...But then it just disappeared one day.  When I saw it for the kindle, I downloaded it, but never used it because I didn't have the functionality that it did on my computer...so, I got rid of it.
160774273X|5.0|Bought this for my husband as a BD gift. He is a chef in his own right and LOVED this. Simple, easy to duplicate recipes .... Love the passion this book exudes!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love having this on my phone for those moments when I am stuck waiting somewhere... My kids like it too.  We pass it back and forth.  Once I get started, I really don't want to stop.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Hi,<br /><br />My kids downloaded Dragon Story app for free, but purchased gems and gold.  I was not aware of this and recieved a bill on my creditcard for over $230.00.  Parental control for purchases should be required for this type of game! My kid is 9 and does not know this costs real money.  Be careful!!!!<br /><br />argh!<br /><br />MadDad
B007712XAU|4.0|The writer did a great job introducing each of the main characters and the plot in the first segment. The heros are likable and the other folks are easy to dislike. The story is very interesting and it moves along well. Some of the situations require a huge leap from reality to accept but that is often true.<br /><br />The packaging could be improved to make it easier to know what is on each of the DVDs. This comment is meant to apply to both the physical packaging and the DVD menu approach that was used.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am very pleased with the purchase. Very easy to use.My kids and I use every day. Exellent app for anyone
B001Q5395Q|5.0|I remember seeing some of this movie when i was little.  At first i was a little uneasy to rent this cause it creep the heck out of me.  Of course i was probably 7 around the time.  Now i took courage and rented it, laughed my butt off.  its more funny than scary but im still scared of clowns lol.
1401322786|3.0|Was an OK book but not up to the quality and meaning of Tuesdays With Morrie. Didn't have that WOW factor.
B000AYQJ3I|1.0|Did not know it was a region 2 disc.  Nowhere id it say that when i ordered it.  Disc one plays on my laptop but not disc two...neither will play on myblu  ray.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It reminds me of super mario...and I LOVE super mario. Pretty fun app.
B0057UA486|5.0|It may take awhile to relax into the atmosphere of &#34;Barry Lyndon&#34; but once you do give yourself over to its never ending pleasures you will experience one of the greatest films ever made.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|As others have stated, this is not just a book for teens to read. Parents and other adults whose paths may intersect with teenagers should read this too. Clay's anguish over the death of his classmate by her own hand is palpable. It, also, goes to show that people who feel that they are pushed to the point where suicide is there only way out never have one \\"reason why\\".. there are a multitude of reasons. There is no way to know what kind of a difference you are making in another person's life. Every one of us needs to strive to make each interaction we have with each other to be a positive one. You never know when it might be the last interaction you have with that other person.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|The streaming is so much more reliable through Amazon on my Sony media player than with Netflix.  Never had to worry about buffering in the middle of an episode.
B00BOL3M86|5.0|this is just an awesome tv series.  I would recommend this show in a heart beat for people to watch
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This is a fantastically suspenseful movie and certainly worthy of all the Oscar praise.  Definitely worth watching.  Well done Mr. Affleck
B003ODL004|5.0|We absolutely loved the movie and my husband really liked the music too. Hans Zimmer always delivers when it comes to dramatic movie music!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I've tried several games like this. So far this is the best one.  I highly recommend you try it out.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|Been a fan since the late 80s and like my grandma used to say, \\"You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool us all!\\" The album is not that bad, but if you're gonna dress up a couple guys in another one's gimmick and try to pretend we won't notice, it's not going to work guys (Gene & Paul). Give Tommy and Eric their own identities or take off the make-up. I'm sure these guys have their own persona's!<br /><br />MoPop
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I think this is a good app for some one like a havy sleeper. or for someone. who is always late .
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|From the title and cover thought it would be about a WW2 pilot, but after talking with my partner in crime Blade Braxton,(Wrestlecrap), I was corrected. Denzel usually delivers the goods, and he goes all the way in this film. Some nice eye candy from Nadine Velazquez, and dark humor from John Goodman. Anyone whose ever struggled with addiction can relate, hits hard. Don't sleep on this one!<br /><br />MoPop
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Loved this series!!  Strong characters, story lines, and settings.  I watched all four seasons and was disappointed that the BBC cancelled any plans for a 5th season.  It is a series well worth seeing!  I thought it was even better than Downton Abbey and I am a huge fan of that.  This series has beautiful story lines and life lessons and leaves you &#34;feeling good&#34; at the end of each show.  It is a relaxing distraction from the stress and problems of our modern world.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|The Maze Runner series is probably one of my favorite dystopian YA series out there. Everything about it was just fantastic, and I was so excited to find out that Dashner had written a prequel novel for the series. I had so many questions about the world, and the Flare, and WICKED that were still unanswered by the end of The Death Cure, and I was hoping that The Kill Order would be able to answer most if not all of them.<br /><br />I really was no disappointed. Although The Kill Order has a completely new cast of characters, and the world is a little different (people are still trying to figure out what in the world has happened rather than trying to figure out how to cure it or how to live with it), but it still managed to give insight into the world of The Maze Runner. The characters are still just as interesting, and my heart still broke for them whenever something didn't go their way or something went wrong within their little group.<br /><br />I really enjoyed that the story was presented almost like a flashback - you start out meeting Thomas, and you  end with Thomas and Teresa, but neither Thomas nor Teresa are anywhere to be found within the bulk of the story. This time, we're focused on Mark and Trina and Deedee and all of their friends, in their attempt to find out what is happening with this disease is that's been shot down on them and why anyone would want to infect other people with it.<br /><br />Although there were times when I didn't really like Mark (the story pretty much follows him and his thoughts), I thought it was really interesting the way we were able to see into his dreams/memories of when the sun flares first destroyed the Earth, and to take this journey with him to locate his friends and try to save them. Dashner did an excellent job portraying Mark's emotions, as well as creating dynamic, round supporting characters.<br /><br />The plot was fast-paced and very much like that in the other Maze Runner books, so it was nice to have that consistency even though we had to become adjusted to characters we had never seen before. Most of my questions were answered over the course of the book, although some were still left open-ended and The Kill Order raised even more. But it was still a very satisfying read.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to any fans of the Maze Runner trilogy, as well as to fans of The Hunger Games, Divergent, and other dystopian YA series. 4/5 to The Kill Order, and I hope you go pick up this series soon if you haven't already!istency even though we had to become adjusted to characters we had never seen before.

B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|its about time a new idea has surfaced in the movie industry, a great family movie with a lot of talented support.
B00138KFYO|5.0|Saw her at the Atlantic City Pop Festival in late 1960's. Brings back great era! 2 day event I had to go without parents finding out
B00BHMETKC|2.0|we thought this movie was terrible, although we understand the story, the movie was not what we expected based on all the &#34;hoopla&#34;
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great time waster and a challenge at the same time.  I have recommended this product to friends and they agree.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|we loved it and look forward to the next one. to bad it will take another year before we have that chance.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I got this of course from checking on line on how to get and use Adobe product and watch youtube videos online.  Read online because you will need a file manager but it is well worth it.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|lost us right from the beginning, a lot of noise and camera action but didn't hold a candle to previous &#34;bourne&#34; movies
B00APUQH0W|4.0|This is a good movie.  I recommend to make sure you have a date because it is one of those types of movie.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is so stupid. It has no point and is unrealistic.  The fat man shouldn't be able to catch a small fast kid.  I hate this game because all my friends are better than me.:)  Don't get this game!!!:(
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Still not used the full potential of this product.  I do enjoy the ability to control the files etc.  See comment on the Dolphin Browser.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Looking forward to reading the next book in the trilogy. Enjoyed it very much.  Easy to read, a page turner.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book, so much so that I also bought Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell, which I am now reading. The fast pace of the book is intensified by the fact that it is all true. I am in awe of the Navy SEALS and all of our military. I respected them before but now I am truly awed by their training, their dedication, focus and their incredible professionalism. What exemplary men!<br />I have recommended it and will continue to do so to everyone.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|What an incredible voice.  Wish I could request songs for her to sing. I wish her the best-she is a star!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this has been the best way for me to get a quick calculator that wasn't horrible thank you for this.
B0096BIENY|5.0|You can't got wrong with Il Divo if you like male neo-opera.  Great voices.  People who don't like non-English singing probably won't like this.  Too bad Il Divo isn't more popular in the US because they are fantastic singers.
B0001HAISQ|2.0|I can't make it through without passing out...I've tried several times to no avail. Oh well, this is life. Bye!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|By far the best thing on television now! The casting is excellent and the writing fabulous. While there are not a large number of episodes per season, each one is quite substantial and satisfying. Happy to report that each person to whom I have recommended this series has become completely hooked!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|THe Book  gives a very serious issue and relates well how to do right, how to write headlines, well done, I enjoyed reading and still reading this wonderful book.
6305428042|5.0|This movie is just the best - I watched it at least 4 times this past Halloween season!  It's definitely a movie I look forward to every year.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is amazing it gets addicting its so much fun these enimies are hard to get rid of<br />don't waste pinecones
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I am stunned by the impact of this small book. My personal search for meaning feels as if it is addressed on every page, in every shared experience. I'm so glad I found this book after decades of living rather than when I was young.
B004CS7R70|5.0|this Glass give my wife more relax and sit back than close to tv and no longer sore neck !!! so big kiss to our friend fromm London who got it too
B0037NVM2C|4.0|The soundtrack of Terminator broke ground for the genre, with its creepy, haunting and ominous techno kind of feel. In all the Terminator movies, the sound track is pretty much the star. T2 adds deeper character to the series. Even the bad Terminator has interesting depth and responses to the role.<br /><br />Was the original Terminator a lot scarier? Oh yeah. But the liquid metal Terminator felt like he fit right into the L.A. Police Department. Not sure if that was intended to be a comment on the department but in retrospect that's a lot of what the police can be. Scary and everywhere. No point in shooting back, just try to stay away.<br /><br />Meanwhile the T1000 played by Schwarzenegger enjoys the chance to embrace some of the nicer bits of California, the desert, John as a child, nice bikes. Stunts were great and the comedy was better. Whoever played the waitress in the biker bar, she nailed the look. Worth watching again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really great for the kindle. I like this book. Can't wait to read the next book in the series. Really great again.
B0036EBARO|3.0|Goldfrapp's HEAD FIRST mines a new vein of pop: the 80s! And right from \\"Rocket,\\" the album revels in its shiny synths with plenty of that retro feel: \\"Alive\\" sounds like the track Olivia Newton-John never got to record. \\"Dreaming\\" and \\"Hunt\\" could be the soundtrack for 'Silk Stalkings,' but the title track goes back to perkiness. Alas, overall, it feels as if something is missing on the album, and that's the sense of exploration that Goldfrapp does so well. This album doesn't too many surprises, and it's a bit of a shame. The muttered vocals of \\"Shiny and Warm\\" move in the right direction but it's not until \\"Voicething\\" that we get to see Goldfrapp playing with their sound -- and succeeding. Let's hope they plunge head first in yet another direction.
B0058VW36U|5.0|We can just pull our hair out with this one but, it is fun. Kids really enjoy it. Kids have a competiion going to see who feeds it the most.
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|I'll be honest: when I first heard SEVENTH TREE, I thought, 'What the...?' Goldfrapp is nothing but surprising; whereas BLACK CHERRY and SUPERNATURE were both steeped in dance music, SEVENTH TREE finds its roots in English folk-pop. But, with repeated listens, the album grew on me. And now? I think it stands up. Goldfrapp's voice is given a new texture to work with, and on \\"Clowns,\\" it sounds more ethereal than ever against a backdrop of plucked guitars and pulled strings. The elecctronics are still there, but used much more subtly, like the quiet tweeting on \\"Little Bird\\" that quickly turns cosmic. The filters on \\"Eat Yourself\\" make it sound like a crackly vinyl dug up from someone's basement somewhere, while \\"A&E\\" goes for the bucolic. \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" meanwhile dives headfirst into the 70s with its string sweeps. But there are two things that Goldfrapp excel at, and they're both on this album. The first is pure pop pleasure, and the ridiculously joyous \\"Happiness\\" delivers this in spades. The second is melancholy beauty, and \\"Some People\\" has this base covered. The SEVENTH TREE continues to grow in my heart.
1400052181|4.0|I bought the book for a social studies class, and i still refer to it in some conversations. It is a very worth while read.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This is a very creepy movie. I LOVE the Horror genre, but most of the stuff out there is crap, or torture porn. However, Sinister is creepy enough to keep you looking over your shoulder the whole time. Ethan Hawke is terrific, and I never would have picked him for a horror movie kind of guy. The only complaint I have is the same complaint I have about The Last Exorcist. The ending is abrupt.  Other than that, good flick. Check it out!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno Mars music and Unorthodox Jukebox was great. I listen to it all the time.  His musicis great for young and old.  I am 57 and love it.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|very interesting, in depth account of the great music recorded at Sound City thru the decades and the impact of technology.  The collaboration between Homme, Grohl and Resnor at the end is outstanding.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Entertaining film. Great performances especially by Alan Arkin and John Goodman, but not best picture of the year. That would be Life of Pi.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The first section is spot on.  Great insights into habits.  How they are wired into our brains and approaches for changing them.  Really interesting stuff.<br /><br />Subsequent sections meander a bit.  More general insights into behavior and best practices, but less focused on habits.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love this sight! So many wonderful ideas, pictures, recipes and so on!  Spend so much time going through all the neat stuff and planning all the things i want to make...i wind up not having time left to start working on something!!
B009K0P10K|4.0|I am enjoying the series but not sure where the story line will take us or if it will get so convoluted that my interest will wain - will see.
0316066524|5.0|Timeless insight. Wish I had met David and had a conversation with him about life, spirit and passion. He overflowed with passion for living to a point where his passion overcame him. A book for all centuries of human existence.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie, thriller without much violence. this is crazy you beg me to do a review and then require a certain amount of words.
B00A4AI19I|5.0|I certainly love these recordings.  Klemperer readings of Brahms symphonies have a distinct quality, one that I deeply enjoy.  Yet, I must comment that Klemperer's approach to music in general is sometimes controversial, as he is widely regarded as a old master that, nonetheless, gave music a life of its own with his slow tempos.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game I play it all the time or I play it on a diffrent devices TEAM SUBWAY SURFERS.
0345522478|4.0|I wish someone had told me ages ago that this book isn't about a teen discovering his powers and going off to a Hogwarts-for-Druids to have Percy-Jackson-like adventures. After hearing cautionary tales about what happens in books when teens discover they have superpowers, I steeled myself and picked up the book.<br /><br />But it turns out, the main character isn't a teen at all - he's ancient. Discovering that in the first few pages made me super-curious. How was Kevin Hearne gonna pull off a character who had been born only a little after the close of the iron age?<br /><br />The answer: he's very good at pretending to 21, with occasional flashes of old.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book. Well developed characters and relationships. Good historical story reflecting societal expectations of race,gender and role within families and hierarchy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was hard to put down!  Very interesting plot. I am looking forward to reading book three and then watching the movies.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best app ever!!! And diffidently way better than the first temple run. Everyone should buy it especially since it ia free.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|This version will most likely be difinitive version on the Blu-ray format. Good color balance, fine detail for such an old film. Definitely pick this one up.
B008B68J2G|5.0|My girls ages 11 & 13 have been into Monster High dolls since they first came out so they have been playing with them for years. I have to say the more Mattel puts out new dolls and accessories, the more they still want them. The Scaris cafe is one of the Monster High items they wanted and is nice set to play with. 2 dolls can fit on the bench seat and 1 on the chair.Everything pretty much comes already assembled except the bench seat just has to be snapped into place and there are hanging plastic skulls for the umbrella to the table that resemble lighting. The picture here on amazon is pretty accurate except it looks as if the table is almost a royal blue and the table is really a nice deep purple color. What you can't see from the picture is the back of the cart has 2 open shelves where items can be placed in it for storage. All the pieces seem pretty sturdy and well made. The cart is moveable, the wheels are working, and it seems pretty easy to wheel the cart while the items on top still stay in place. The cart it 12\\" high if you measure to the top of the bat and about 11\\" at the peak of the top of it and the base of the cart is about 6\\" wide. It comes with a 2 cup cappuccino maker and a little mug, it also has 3 different types of ghoulish pastries, a goblet, a little vase for the table, a little eiffel tower treat. I think any kid into Monster High would love this set. My girls paired it up next to the Monster high Coffin Bean playset, which is also another nice set to play with. I would reccommend this product to anyone who loves Monster High. The reason for the 4 stars for educational, ok it's Monster High it is of course more for playing with then for learning, but having a little one who recieved Early Intervention, you could use some of it for educating, requesting for them to put the dolls on the chair, off the chair, at the table, and requesting items and so on. All and All it is fun.
1451696191|5.0|This book is probably my new favorite &#34;teen&#34; novel. I am in my 20s and I found it incredibly relatable and warm. The narrator, Charlie, draws you in and all of a sudden you're laughing and crying with him. I read this book because my university chose it for this semester's Book Club, and I believe we chose a fabulous book. Plenty to think on, from issues like drugs, abuse, sex, and mental issues, to friendship and dealing with growing up.<br />The movie version was very close to the book, and I would wholeheartedly recommend both the book and the movie to anyone looking for a book to make you feel something about life again.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This is a very difficult game and this game is not for a 4yr-6yrs because you have a hard time trying to throw the birds around.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series, this is not my favorite of the series but loved it none-the-less. It's a great read for young and older readers.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is for all age because it not that hard to play and it's fun. My 4yrs old son loved it.
B000ZIXGFS|4.0|This will make you feel like you're in the '70s. what a solid rock'n roll album. sometines, it gets stoner as hell and you start to headbang like a madman to the music. The only thing that I didn't like from this album was the packaging. I mean, you have a great album cover, you could make a good booklet and a digipak por the limited 2disc edition, I was a little dissapointed by that. the music is great.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is very hard to paly. My son cant play this game and he get frustration. Sometimes he be hesitant if he want to play or not.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I bought because it is one of my favorite movies and could not beat the price. Watch if you get the chance.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is really quite excellent. I would say that the only complaint i've heard is that it is pretty long, but I thought it was well paced and was never bored.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I bought because it is one of my favorite movies and could not beat the price. Watch if you get the chance.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show is a spectacular adaption of a wonderful book series. All the actors are excellent, and the script remains pretty close to the book. No complaints.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is excellent. It kept me enthralled through the whole book and left me wanting more. I look forward to the next book.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|If you have a kindle fire, then this app is for you. I love pictures. Kind of a camera buff myself. About 2000 pics.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This season is another excellent series (as good or better than the first). Actors, script, and effects are spot on.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I love this movie and I think it's even better the second time around. My 2 1/2 year old thinks its a great movie and it keeps her very interested.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great author, awesome characters... I want to read it all again.  I definitely recommend this series.  This was probably my favorite book of all three.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout! I was very sore after doing it the first few days. You will definitely get in shape!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Daughters loved it! They read it so fast that I thought they weren't reading it. I asked if they were going to read the book I bought and they both said they already read it. They both enjoyed it very much.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|i haven't try my purchase yet but i already see the movie and it's a well managed love story, not so classic, but a really good one
B009K916ZK|5.0|No issues connecting my monitor with this adapter.  This is a OEM adapter, as stated. Why is there a minimum word requirement for reviews??
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Even though it is black and white, it is a great story and the scenery (Italy) wonderful.
B007NESBK2|5.0|One of my favorite bands of all time with a divine front-woman!  This Blu-ray is a beautiful way to remember that tour!  Please tour again Sade!!!
B007H9B8FS|4.0|This CD has some great music on it, however I wouldn't call it Garbage's best ever. You can definitely tell its Shirley Manson and the band, and some songs definitely stand out.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|Can;t tell you if it works or not can not get my audio books to my kindle.  I have tried everything & they just sit on my computer.  Some have even gone into my ITunes.  But that is another problem. So can't say if it works or not.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|When Season 1 came out. I was skeptical.  Firgure it be a bust of a show. I was so wwrong. It was thrilling and kept me wanting more. When Season 2 came out. I thought they could never top the first season. Boy, once more I was wrong. So much action and showing the trials and tribulations going on in the group. So of course I was like no way can they top the second.  Yes I admit, THEY CAN! This season has been action packed, shocking story line twist and leaves me on the edge of me seat begging for it not to end the episode. I hate waiting!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works great.  Download music goes right to my ITunes.  You must have this app to download music from Amazon. It is free
B00APUQRPC|4.0|THis was a sweet story, but I wasn't convinced about the chemistry between Adams and Timberlake. Eastwood and Adams made a great father/daughter pair.

1609611543|5.0|No diet or other book I have read provided such an immediate super-positiive result for me. Half-way through listening to the book, I decided to experiment and go off wheat. I have had a very, very long-standing problem of an almost unending rash. Practically the day after I stopped consumming any kind of wheat, the rash on my lower back dissapeared about 98%.. And I believe it will be completely gone shortly.<br /><br />FOR YEARS, I struggled with this rash, wondering \\"Did eating nuts cause the rash? Sugar? Dairy? ...this, that???  The culprit was WHEAT..!! Wheat can affect your skin, your eyes, your heart, your brain...all of you.<br /><br />This doctor/author gives some pretty damning info on wheat.  BTW, there is wheat in all kinds of food products including some beers (I don't drink beer, but some of you may...). Also, the author says it doesn't matter whether the wheat is ORGANIC (which is what I ate), multi-grain, stone ground, sourdough. He said, wheat is wheat. Period.<br /><br />Read the book and see what you think.

B00A2LOAKI|3.0|My 12 year old and I watched both Part 1 and Part 2.  While I think this was good overall, Part 2 was most bizarre. . . Amazon Nazi, zombie-like Ronald Reagan, cold-blooded killings, and the after-effects of a nuclear blast on Superman.  I wasn't quite ready for this weirdness.
0374214913|5.0|Mr Penumbra’s 24-Hour Book Store is one of the best books I have read recently.  Intriguing theme, interesting characters, a well developed plot line, and satisfying conclusion.<br />Clay Jannon is an out of work graphics designer with an interest in code who stumbles across a vacancy at Mr Penumbra’s book store in a San Francisco side street, and things, as they say, develop from there. In a mildly bizarre, bookish, computerish and nerdish sort of way.  If I was to draw a comparison with other authors William Gibson’s work since Pattern Recognition might come to mind.<br />Mr Sloan introduces a variety of characters as the story unfolds, and while their characters are not deeply developed, they are developed to the extent needed for their roles.  Likewise descriptive passages are sparingly used, but used to the extent necessary for the development of the story. There is, for example, no violence as such, and there’s probably more words spent on food than on sex.  Dialogue, though, is intense, and, I think, quite droll at times, making the book a delight to read.<br />I have no hesitation in recommending this book.  And I will scan future release lists eagerly for Mr Sloan’s next work.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo certainly deserved the accolades (including the Best Picture Oscar) that it received. The prologue was succinct and set up the reason for the anger that erupted in Iran after the Shah's fall. Just enough history to keep those of us who lived through the 444 day siege of our embassy refreshed and not so much to keep the 30 and under crowd from getting bored. Clever scripting , nice use of hsitroical photo overlays to authenticate the semi-fictional action. My only questions - were the last 20 minutes or so of the film enhanced for dramatic effect? Were all the coincidences and near misses a figment of the screenwriter's imagination or were the six escapees and their CIA shephard that lucky? In any case, the final minutes of the film were edge of the seat intense. Definitely worth the rental! I rented this after seeing &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; in the theater the night before. Together they made a thematically sizziling and emotionally ripping double bill!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Very entertaining period drama.  It is well done with a good story that draws you in.  If you like Downton abbey you'll like Upstairs Downstairs.

B009CG29RK|5.0|This is the story of a villain who learns to open his heart and love 3 little orphaned girls in his own special way.  The story is funny, endearing, and entertaining for kids and adults alike.

0060872675|5.0|It's a bedtime story that will keep the parents chuckling and the kids interested.  If you are a fan of Terry Pratchett this is an absolute must have. It's full of fun illustrations and Pratchett's witty humor.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This bag has EVERYTHING I want in a pack for my camera rig, plenty of space, rugged, place to hold a tripod, everything you need to carry your gear and keep it safe.  Unfortunately, it is severely lacking in any style at all!  The build quality is great, but the design just looks cheap.  Mind you, this review is ONLY about the bags look and not its construction.  Just a sad, nerdy camera bag.  Sorry, I need functionality AND style :-)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is the book I would read if I want something light and easy. Read it during my commutes to work. The story is at times predictable with some nice twists and the characters at times seem unrealistic only because you have to be a hopeless romantic to believe such people and this kind of love still exists. For me Sparks' best work was The Notebook and nothing quite compares... but for a quick and easy read this wasn't bad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This works well like a regular calculator and I love having it right on my Kindle--one less thing to put in my purse!
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I was hooked into streaming this film by the trailer.  I do like Ethan Hawke, and even though this film was coming from the creators of that abysmal dreck \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\", I wanted to give it a chance.  It cost $3.99 to stream on Amazon, and almost certainly is not worth that much.  This is a $1 rental at best folks.  Better yet wait a year and it will be streaming for free--trust me you aren't missing anything.<br /><br />Ignoring for a moment the obviousness of the story, and how easy it is to figure out where it's going before it gets there, the ending is utterly anticlimactic and rushed in a way that is particularly annoying after the 100 minutes of buildup.  I'm sure most people wanted to see Ethan's character fight \\"Mister Boogie\\" in some way--even if he lost.  No such luck--instead the director was counting on shocking you with the banal twist ending that you figured out sixty minutes earlier.  Since that failed utterly, the ending is just a let-down.<br /><br />The movie tries to use jump-scares and loud noises to frighten you, but the repetition left me cold.  It's scary when Ethan walks down a hallway and a ghostly child appears behind him.  It's not scary when it happens five times.  In a row.  Overdoing the scares makes them boring instead of scary.  \\"And now a weird noise\\" is not something you should be thinking right before the director tries to scare you with a weird noise.<br /><br />The characters behave in mind-numbingly stupid ways.  Hawke wanders around his house carrying a baseball bat at night because he hears someone moving around... and walks past light switch after light switch without ever flipping one on.  Ever.  There is no way any sane thinking person wouldn't flip on each and every single light in his situation.  Which means he is deliberately not doing it because it wouldn't be \\"spooky\\" with the lights on.  Which makes the whole thing feel contrived and destroys the tension.<br /><br />Finally, the whole film is shot too damned dark.  You can't see anything half the time.  This doesn't add to the tension or the fear, although it may have you frustratedly checking to see how much more time you are going to have to spend watching this train wreck.<br /><br />In short, the only frightening thing about this picture is that it probably won't be Scott Derrickson's last.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, skip this film.amned dark.

B0053O89KG|5.0|I started watching Castle reruns on TNT. I was sure if I started watching it I would like it. I didn't realize it would become my favorite TV show.
B0035YTG30|4.0|Nice romantic old movie a classic.  Fun to watch with family, friends, your honey, or by yourself.I'd recommend this film.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love everything about this show. Writing, chemistry, stories. I think Stana Katic is beautiful and her portrayal of Detective Beckett is magic.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|it's nice to have a series with action to watch during the winter. I don't have cable TV to watch.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love Castle. It is a great show. I bought the dvd set because I was late getting to watch it.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Not sure if it is my Internet speed, but the show kept buffering and we could not enjoy it on amazon video. We had to watch it on my iPad which with the small screen it wasn't as enjoyable as it could be on our large screen tv. I wish I had not have purchased this season.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love everything about this show. Detective Beckett gets more beautiful every episode. The whole cast is great. Good chemistry.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I rarely give up on a book but this book was way too detailed. It took me 2 hours to read a chapter introducing a character. I love to read and I love the story but I think I would prefer another writers interpretation of the story.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Lived up to the hype. Love the vintage cinematography during the reenactment of the taking of the US embassy in Iran.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Hey,<br /><br />I really loved this album. My older brother purchased it for me for Christmas and it was splendid! The intro is really amazing and I loved the way it ended. Of course, there are songs on there that I'm not in love with such as \\"Fire We Make\\" and \\"Listen to Your Heart\\". I will say though, even though a lot of people didn't like the Nicki Minaj part, I found it interesting and I think it added a nice twist to the album. The introduction, \\"De Novo Adagio\\" is beautiful and I think my favorite part of the entire album. Me, being a pianist myself, really appreciated the beautiful intro.<br /><br />\\"Brand New Me\\" is a really nice song with really nice lyrics. I love the piano and the music in the song and overall, it's a really meaningful song.<br /><br />\\"When It's All Over\\" is a weird song. I mean, the tune and the music don't exactly match up so perfectly and I don't think anyone will love the song at first, but I grew to like the song very much and I love the ending with Keys' daughter. It's super cute!!!<br /><br />\\"Listen to Your Heart\\" is a nice song at first, but it gets a little cliche. It has a nice message but after a while, you don't want to listen to it anymore. If anyone asks, I like the song. But I wouldn't listen to it 5 times in a row, for sure. The verses are cool but I'm really not that big of a fan of the the chorus which is a really important part of a song.<br /><br />\\"New Day\\" is a wonderful song and one of the best songs. It reminds me of a reggae \\"Empire State of Mind\\", in a way. May I add, that I like how she had touches or reggae roots in this album. It really spiced it up and I love how there are some definite party songs on this album. And this one is one of them. It really makes you want to dance.<br /><br />\\"Girl on Fire\\" is a really nice song. The vocals are fantastic and the background singers did a really nice job as well. I can't complain about the song. I don't think Nicki ruined the song at all. I still love her verses.I mean, I prefer the first verse in the beginning instead of the second towards the middle ending of the song. She didn't have to have two, but overall, it's a really nice song to listen to. No hate on Nicki! :)<br /><br />\\"Fire We Make\\" is a slow seductive sexy song that you listen to with your partner. Me, being single, couldn't really relate to the song and since it had Maxwell, it reminded me of older R&B. I'm not talking about 80s. I'm talking about 90's and early 2000's. I have no hate towards the song, but I'm not a big fan of this one. Still, the vocals are really good for this song. Maxwell was a good artist to add for the song.<br /><br />\\"Tears Always Win\\" is a very nice song. The lyrics are so very meaningful and they're very nice. I love the harmony in this song and I often times catch myself singing this beautiful song. It's a great song in the album. Not one of my favorites, but a good song.<br /><br />\\"Not Even the King\\" is a very good song. It reminds me of another Keys song from the mid 2000's, I believe. \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is the song it reminds me of and both songs are really beautiful. I'm loved Keys from the start and she's one of my favorite artists. :)<br /><br />\\"That's When I Knew\\" is a very soft song that makes me really happy to listen to because it's so relate-able and sweet and kind. It reminds me of soft colors and happiness. I think of Spring when I think of this song and it's a really adorable song.<br /><br />\\"Limitedless\\" is most definitely one of my favorite songs on the enitre album. I loved it so much. I love the beat and how it makes you want to sing and dance and be silly. Although, I would recommend it for a party, it is a love song and it has very cute lyrics.<br /><br />\\"One Thing\\" is like most others. It's a really adorable song with beautiful music and beautiful lyrics. No complaints what-so-ever.<br /><br />\\"101\\" was the perfect way to end the album. It's a really soft beautiful song with a really nice tune and melody.The piano is so good! My goodness! Yes! I'm in love with the way they ended the song. It's so beautiful and it reminds me of a part in \\"Brand New Me\\". Hallelujah to Alicia Keys for making such a good album! :)

B00AYB0TOW|3.0|In this dystopian Sci-Fi story all the action takes place in a high rise housing project. It's just like a present day housing project in that there is a lot of violence, but there are some key differences.<br /><br />The biggest difference is that in this movie the racial roles are reversed. Real housing projects are almost all filled with black residents who kill one another frequently. In Dredd the initiators of the ultra violence are the whites and the black residents are just another set of victims. In the movie the police force seems to be all white except for the police chief who is a black woman.<br /><br />Of course in the real world we don't build multi storied housing projects anymore, much less these super sky scrapers. All the oppressed, poor and miserable tenants of the huge buildings are completely integrated. No one pays any attention to any one's race. Racial harmony has triumphed although no one notes it. It is just taken for granted that race doesn't matter. There are black criminals but more white criminals and everyone gets along with everyone else swimmingly.<br /><br />The message is - what? Are we supposed to admire the way we can dispose of crime and criminals if we just let the police do what ever they want? Are we supposed to take this as a cautionary tale about rising crime? Currently most violent crime in America is committed by blacks. Detroit today is if anything worse off than the mega-city depicted in this film. But in their version of the future there is no connection between race and crime.<br /><br />It's not too clear what went wrong in the world of this movie. Everyone lives in a single city surrounded by empty desert. Why? Maybe this is explained in the comic books. I kept wondering what they ate? In any case they seemed to have solved the racial integration problem.
0307352145|5.0|Helped me to understand the differences in introverts and extroverts. I enjoyed reading it and have recommended it to others.
B0076XIS4O|4.0|Well, after watching Grimes perform Genesis live I was completely hooked.  Is it pop, synth, dark wave, electronica or what?  It's a mash-up of all that with super catchy beats and dark atmospheres with an etheral and dreamlike quality.  If you're remotely interested in any of those genres, buy this album now and you won't be disappointed.  Definitely one of my top albums of 2012.
B0030B624E|4.0|Loved it! Woody Harrelson is the best! Never knew zombies could be so funny. Bill Murray was just great, too!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very well written and acted.  Very intriguing as this problem could be evident in any profession.  Denzel Washington did give an academt award performance.  In retropsect he was just about every scene and gave a stunning performance.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not one for science fiction, but when I read the outstanding reviews I thought I'd give Wool Omnibus a try, especially for the price.  I loved the book, hardly set it down.  Yes, I will recommend it to friends.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|It's as awesome as I remembered it! I haven't seen fight club in a rather large number of years so it was a pleasant surprise to be able to view it so easily on my kindle!
B0051GOB26|5.0|If you like sick humor this movie is for you. I like this type of humor and the actors were great. This movie is very funny and I can't believe it is as old as it is and I had never heard of it or seen it. I have since seen this movie offered with another package in which you can get a a fan kit which includes numerous things like a coffee cup and I forget what else.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book absolutely had me HOOKED from the very beginning, but the ending sort of surprised me in that it was too 'nice' compared to the rest of the book. I fully anticipated absolute revenge, but instead, it was 'nice' compared to the rest of the book. I'm not disappointed in the book overall, because the way the story unfolds and the way that Flynn depicts Amy as a crazy woman is amazing! But the ending sort of disappointed me.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I hate having a black case covers as it blends with everything. love the shade of red, feel it's durable.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I don't want to repeat everything that's already been said by other reviewers, so this will be short.  I love movies that are based on fact and this is one of the best (if not THE best) I've ever seen.  I remember when the Shah was overthrown in Iran and when the American Embassy was taken over.  I remember all the yellow ribbons and the heart-wrenching wait to get the hostages home, which might be part of the reason I enjoyed this movie so much, but I also think it will be very much appreciated by younger viewers.  Ben Affleck and everyone involved with the production of Argo did such an excellent job of re-creating the look and feel of 1979.  I didn't notice a single word or shot that wasn't consistent with the times and, as you will see at the end of the movie, the actors actually looked like the real people they portrayed.  I was amazed by the scenes that brought to life the historical newspaper and TV photos that are burned into the memories of so many Americans. Yes, there were scenes that weren't exactly historically accurate, but they were necessary to convey the fear, tension and apprehension felt by those involved in the grand scheme that was hatched to save the lives of six American diplomats and get them back home to their families.  Stellar performances by Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston and the rest of the cast, the excellent period scenery, the script and the amazing directorial talent made this a movie that will be remembered and loved for many years to come.
0345803507|5.0|I have recommeded the books to friends and family. The triology was well written,very interesting and I enjoyed reading all three books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been watching the walking dead since day 1 and I have been Hooked ever since. Each season brings something new and exciting to the table and season 3 is by far the best thing I have ever seen.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This &#34;seemed&#34; to be okay, but it just took up space on my iphone, and I didn't use it that much.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty fun. It's graphics are really in high definition. You should really give this game a try.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a breath of fresh air, no re-hacking of time worn themes, empires or semi-magical aliens, just a well thought out, detailed exploration of a survivor using his intelligence to stay alive when accidently left behind on Mars.<br />Perhaps a tad too detailed for some, but a great (new)idea with a lot of laughs.  The end could have been better, hence the 4 stars.
B004GYY714|5.0|Easy to find what your interest are in music. Offers great variety of stations to select from. Makes searching so very easy.
0316228532|5.0|It took me a good six months to get through this book because I chose to listen to the audiobook instead of reading it.  With kids around, I found it difficult to find time where I could turn on the book and listen, lol.  As you're probably aware, this is JK Rowling's first \\"adult\\" novel.  (Personally, I think more adults than kids loved her Harry Potter series, but since everyone insists on categorizing them Young Adult, who am I to argue?)<br /><br />The story takes place in a small rural English town where we immediately learn that a member of the town council has died of a heart attack, leaving what is known as a \\"casual vacancy.\\"  As they story progresses, we learn more than we probably wanted to know about the various folk in this town, some of whom are vying for this open council seat.  We see all of their faults....and holy cow, do they have faults.  Not to be judgmental here, but I can honestly say that any dysfunction my own family has (don't we all?) pales in comparison to the families Rowling introduces us to.<br /><br />Small town politics, Rowling shows, can be just as dirty as the big leagues and often with more dire consequences.  The central political argument in our small town here is the presence of a low-rent neighborhood.  Our characters vying for the council seat are split between eschewing any social responsibility and those who believe there can be redemption of the downtrodden.<br /><br />While it might seem that Rowling is blatantly championing social responsibility, in reality she goes to great pains to present reality....there is no right answer.  While it is certainly a noble ideal, Rowling shows that ideals sometimes fall far, far short.<br /><br />Ultimately, I very much enjoyed her work here.  Yes, as I'm sure you've heard, there is a lot of vulgar language, a lot of sex, drug usage, etc and so on.  And I thought every last bit was pertinent to the story!  Rowling has proven with this novel that she is a first rate storyteller.

So, it stayed in it's package until I gave it to him. Now, he carries it around with him all the time, which I think means he likes it!

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Certainly didn't promote confidence in those who fear putting their lives in the hands of druggies.  Too convincing of stupidity.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|By far my favorite of all the Tolkien adaptations, this one feels more like the pacing in the books, slower, letting things develop better. The lightheartedness from The Hobbit is also somewhat present, which is a welcome surprise.<br /><br />Ignore the naysayers, it's a grand return to Middle-Earth.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|While Season 3 of Downton Abbey is not as fabulous as the first two, the soap opera-esque writing still sucks you into the addictive show.  There are some great episodes and story lines in season 3 that make it worth watching including the wedding of the year and Sybil and family dynamics.  Of course, there is also more than a few boring stories that never seem to pick up speed (Bates Prison snoozefest).  The surprise ending seems like a lazy writer's solution to a casting issue.  I am not looking forward to the next season as I may have for past seasons.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|OMG!!!!!! This book is sooooooo well written. I have read all of Rick Riordan' s kids books. One question: When does the House of Hades come out????????? Ps. I've read this book seven times so far. I love his books.
B00AXVIHBU|1.0|My wife particularly wanted to see series 3 of this event. I purchased this item but it was a waste of our time. It was disjointed, froze for minutes at a time and we finally gave up.

B003WUYRGI|1.0|I think it's ok but I never even read this book I just as killed patches actually I skipped all pages video I don't know
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I like the Alien Movies so when I saw these were on sale I grabbed them.  Nice packaging and would make a nice gift.
1616550414|5.0|A good book with beautiful artworks from Legend of Zelda series! Must Have! I would give more than five stars if possible.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really like this story.  If you've seen the movie, I recommend reading the book since it goes into much more detail.
B005HSL626|3.0|was loaded by my niece.  she seemed to injoy it<br /><br />She said that she would recommend it to 13 years or younger
B008CP6RWU|4.0|These aren't the most super fun games in the world, but if you like to zone out and just play a great looking game, then I recommend these.  Journey is unlike any other game I've seen.  It's just a really pretty story.  The other two are great looking as well.  Flower is collecting more and more petals and Flow is eat or be eaten.  I just like the graphics and the simplicity of these games.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very captivating! Very enjoyable! Couldn't wait to finish the book. Had a hard time putting it down! Can't wait to read another.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Well, the best thing about this movie is the actual plane crash. Very exciting. Denzel Washington is so cool during this scene. Love to meet the writer who thought of telling flight attendant to talk to black box.The other parts are a little too disconnected. Not too crazy about the female lead actress, reminds me of a weak Diane Keaton, although I loved the flight attendant, nice and believable relationship between she and captain,D W.Too repetitious,we get the point he had a problem, good acting on part of lawyer but unrealistic scenario at hearing, not believable.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|the main problem is that if u have a stack u cant seperate it into smaller stacks. I'm sticking to minecraft
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Different Bond- New Q, New M, and new Money Penny..... too many new people all at once. And No Bond Girl!
B001FBSMF8|5.0|Been a fan since before SG was popular to listen to, so pretty much anything CC is apart of I like. This group of songs/music is completely different then anything before. You kind of have to have an open mind to different formats of styles, which is what is offered here. I just know I like this CD and I'm glad I took the chance and bought it.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Great Movie!! Couldnt quit laughing through the whole movie. I have decided that im going to buy the DVD now.
1576875776|5.0|The discovery of Vivian Maier's enormous body of work is the most important find of our times.  Her work is better than any of the big name street photographers that are already in the history books.  This work will have books devoted exclusively to her photographs (this one already does).  100,000 negatives.  It's staggering.  And we've only seen a few so far.  I can't wait to see the rest.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|If someone made this stuff up nobody would believe it, but the story of Henry VIII is well told and nice to see it focus on the earlier years of his reign rather than the later years. Of course, I hope the later seasons do get to the later years, but until then I'm really enjoying the early years.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was late to this obsession and really felt disdain for the described-by-others as a British soap opera.  It only took the first two episodes to get hooked.  Until I ordered the 2nd season, I'd seen the 1st and the third.  I watched all episodes from the 2nd series in the course of 2 days and now it all makes more sense in terms of the characters and their interaction.  I can't wait for the 4th series because now I know &#34;everything.&#34;
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|After hearing him live, it's hard not to keep buying his music.  The music grabs you and doesn't let go.  Josh's voice just pulls you along with him and you don't want him to stop singing.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Pretty fun! Very well designed, excellent hint system. Good storyline and screen interaction, no bugs so far, good graphics, ok!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We really enjoyed watching this movie, it had a bit of everything in it. It was also interesting to learn about a bit of history that we didn't know much about.
B00785P2QC|2.0|this is a very fun game cant wait to build a bigger city and get more items so that I can move on.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Haven't had time to completely evaluate this app but seems to be very good. I'd recommend it as it seems to be very user friendly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series even though I had to catch up with series 1 & 2 first. Great acting by all and will miss Dan Stevens searing blue eyes. Cannot wait for season 4 !
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a great movie, but disappointingly, doesn't tell the real story. If it didn't pretend to be based on a true story that wouldn't matter.
B008K7WCJM|3.0|I like music that works outside the box, and this band certainly does that. I am trying to like this band, with some success but not as much as I'd like. What works for me is the dark, semi-industrial &#34;noise&#34; nature of the music. What does not always work is the length and repetitive nature of some of the songs. Michael Gira's minimalist approach on many of these songs, including the title track just feels like music going nowhere slowly and outlasting my interest level by several minutes, making some of it feel like filler. I also admit--and this is my fault, not Gira's--that the religious imagery is confusing. Is he engaging in Christian proselytizing? Just commenting on religion from the sidelines? I feel like there is either no real point to this imagery, or perhaps there is a point which is just too obscure to 'get'. Also, Gira's reputation for being a jerk doesn't help me like his music any more. He is well-known for berating his live audience, even stomping on people's fingers if they dare put their hands on the edge of the stage. It's hard to like an artist who seems to hate his own audience. So this disc hasn't succeeded in making me a fan, but I will take some of the responsibility for that. The bottom line is that this isn't a disc I will be listening to or enjoying as much as I had hoped to.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game makes me laugh out loud! It's great to get a coaster in safe. But it's always hilarious to crash!
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|The special effects were much better then the original. That was the only part that was better. The movie was bad .
B0041KBWM0|3.0|Prefer version with Gwenyth Paltrow overall in terms of all character portrayals.  Enjoyed the early years setup at beginning of this one which helps one understand the motivations of the characters.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book was an EXCELLENT read. Yes, it was a little stereotypical at first, the preppy princess falling for the bad boy, yada yada yada. However, this was written very well! You can really identify with and feel for the characters. The relationships form well and are consistant throughout the book. I was absolutely HOOKED on this series after reading this book. It's perfect for some light and fun reading.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Real, believable action story.  Opened my eyes to the realities of the war in Iraq. Highly recommended to anyone who finds war stories of interest.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Different, insightful, and captivating!!!! So well written, so tastefully dramatized!!!! LOVED IT!!!! The whole scenario was like another world to me!!!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This is a great client for the Plex Media Server.  You install it on a computer and point it at your media and it streams the videos to any connected client, locally or over the web.  Super easy to set up, super easy to use. Auto fills the meta data and you get a great entry to your own data from anywhere.

B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I find the story line and images to very disturbing but in a good way because this is what the movie meant to do. I understand and can even feel why Ethan Hank was drinking and even started smoking during and after watching those clips. I haven't scare or even thrill for a while with all those predicable new horror movies. Although, the movie is predicable after watching 10-15 minutes of it, it does give the thrill and drama you ask for.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|kinda too long, kinda predictable.  A few of the plot points were not realistic and overly exaggerated fight scenes that were too obvious to ignore.  But still entertaining.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This app has a very simple interface, and it's very easy to use.<br /><br />I have downloaded a few Sudoku apps in the past, and there was always some portion of the pencil feature I didn't like.  This one seems better than the other ones.  I won't list them because I don't remember which ones I've used.
0553103547|4.0|As is the consensus, Martin's Game of Thrones series (at least this first installment) is a fantastical masterpiece. Truthfully, I first heard about it through HBO's show, but I'm sure I'm not in the boat alone. I've heard wonderful things about it from my colleagues in grad school, but never gave it a watch until a year later, when I finally had HBO installed at my home. As the entire first and second years were on streaming, I was able to watch them at my own pace. But that pace was much quicker than I thought. Indeed, the show deserves all the praise it's been receiving.<br /><br />Interestingly, I'm one to watch a show/movie based off a book after I've read the book, so I felt guilty about not reading the books beforehand. So I requested the first installment from my local library and delved into Martin's literary world. Boy, what a ride.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm not sure what I was expecting in terms of differences, but I can tell you that whoever was in charge of adapting the show did a terrific job. They so skillfully transcribed it from book to show that I found very little differences between the two (except, of course, more detail), and I actually became bored at times reading it. But that isn't to say Martin's work is itself boring, I just went in expecting something that wasn't there.<br /><br />Martin's writing is masterful, leagues above any recent author's I've read. His command of metaphor, simile, and plot device is rivaled by few, and his knowledge of mediaeval England and its lore is meticulous and tireless. I had a joy reading this cover to cover, and read it much quicker than I anticipated. His characters are unbelievably rich, and he isn't afraid of reality, as he tries to employ it whenever possible into his world of magic and dragons. Without going too much into detail, I will say that Martin isn't interested keeping characters because of their significance, but he will use their name and importance all throughout the story.<br /><br />Though the book is worthy of five stars, I will dock one for my own personal taste. While I admire and am also intimidated by Martin's work, I must admit that, at times, his skillful use of metaphor became weary at times. I found that he sometimes became too wordy, too detailed, that it slightly detracted from the story. Where I wanted to carry on with the story, Martin's narrative became either vague or trailing, leading into images in my head that weren't necessary for the story to progress.<br /><br />But that's me, and Martin's work in general is nothing short of a masterpiece. On to the next! (And hopefully before the third season starts, though at this point it looks like that's not happening.)ough the book is worthy of five stars, I will dock one for my own personal taste.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Having grown up on a dairy & grain farm BEFORE chemical agriculture it is all true.  I would no longer even drink the water on my home place. It is a nitrate cocktail.  Corporate Ag may produce short term financial gains but it is an unmitigated disaster when it comes to food quality.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This app gives a good view on what numbers you've already used. I also like the jigsaw sudoku puzzles. Good user interface
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Works great! does just what it should. same as desktop! told friends sbout it.  rated five stars.  share and tag.  edit photos.
B0068THAGY|4.0|This was a fun flick.  It was kind of a combination of Goonies, E.T. and  Alien.  Good for kids and adults alke.
B000068FUS|5.0|I knew who DBT were and had heard of this record; read several reviews of it in fact.  I finally got around to buying it some ten years after its release, and I am certainly glad I did.  I grew up in Georgia in the 1970s, so Southern Rock along with Funk and R&B was the soundtrack for my childhood.  This record takes a deep look at the entire genre, the region, and the people who make and listen to the music.  The playing is spot on, and the songwriting is fantastic.  Whether or not you grew up in the South makes no difference; when you hear tunes like Ronnie and Neil or McGovern, you'll get real insight into subjects you may know nothing about but really thought you did.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|Based on the comics, this Animated Feature was better than the recent Batman Movie the Dark Knight Rises. Looking forward to part 2.
B007NMN2US|5.0|I got this for my nephew's 16th birthday.  He loves batman and really like the keychain!  The arms and legs are movable!  So cute.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|My only complaint is that a friend and I had it up to over 400 games and it suddenly didn't work anymore. My friend wasn't getting any words to choose from. We had to start a new series of games.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|boring and slow. I had no interest in it. Had to watch it twice since I fell asleep the first time.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|i love his musice and his personality. his has great talent and i love his video's too. wish he had more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I first discovered Downton after its second season. I enjoyed the first and season in about one week!!! I loved it and couldn't wait for the third season!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great story but I must admit it was kind of slow. Affleck did a great job directing and it was cool looking at the old hair styles and glasses of the 70s but I expected more of a spy movie with killing and suspense.
B00271HAK8|5.0|This is a movie that you have to experience once in your life.  So watch it if you have never seen it.
B005HED1BE|5.0|They did a good job of remastering the series, watched it with my 9yr old son who brand new to the series.
B008476HBM|5.0|Love Jane Austen books and it is one of my favorite movies so I needed to read the book. The book is always better than the movie, it gives you that bit more that you needed to know.

B00AO686L0|5.0|I first saw this movie during a finance class in college since it tied into corporate dealings and practices.  I absolutely loved it and bought the DVD the next day.  Ever since Blu-Ray released, this has been one of the films I've been wanting to see re-released in the High Definition format.  I must say that the wait was worth it and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Video:<br />Presented in a 2.39:1 ratio, the transfer is virtually flawless.  Shadows and black levels are solid and close up shots give amazing detail.<br /><br />Audio:<br />DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 English<br />Dolby Digital 5.1 French<br />Dolby Digital 2.0 Spanish<br /><br />There's not really any action in this film as mainly dialogue driven.  What is here is crisp and clear, although a tad bit on the quiet side requiring me to turn my audio up some.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />A short production featurette, a &#34;commentary&#34; that is really interviews and not a traditional commentary track, and a theatrical trailer.  If you like the behind the scenes stuff on movies, there's not much to be had here.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent release and one to definitely own!
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|The format was odd and anoying.  Even tried fast-forwarding to find a better part without success.  My expectations must not have been realistic
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the world's best game ever it is way more fun than any other game like it if yo do not have this game you better get it.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|The functionality of this product was of prime importance to me.  Five Firewire 400 external pieces of equipment were connected to a hub and then to the adapter.  I started up my computer and operated the gear w/o a hitch.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was really great and i couldn't bring myself to put it down I finished it in two days but it creates a wave of different feelings against the same character throughout the whole book which was both a downside and a hook at the same time I'm definitely excited for the second book
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Loved the characters in this quirky story of loneliness, longing, and institutional criminality.  I did not want the story to end.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|This is the best season. Love the back and forth between universes. What a cliff hanger for a season ending!
B001F3DY9A|5.0|She listens to it non stop.<br />I figured this was just another pretty blonde singer but I was wrong.<br />This girl has talent, and this album is the proof.
B001P1MZNI|4.0|This album has always been a favorite - Sinatra live, Basie's band in their prime, and arrangements by Quincy Jones.  The abrupt and long silence between tracks, however, is annoying.  This is a live album and the interruption should be as short as possible.
B005HSL626|4.0|My grandkids enjoy playing it and I joined them.  It is a seemingly simple game until you try it and realize it requires attention to details and quick reactions.  you will like it.
B007P06DOK|5.0|Classic album with marvelous rhythms and harmonies.  Holds up beautifully after 25 years and my wife and I appreciate the memories it brings back to us!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A great mystery read - in true Grisham form.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  A treat for his fans.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|of the series. The quality of acting increased significantly in this movie. I do think that too many things from the book were unspoken. But that is just Hollywood.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was the biggest news story for all of those 444 days. This movie worked so hard to be authentic and did a great job.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|They're batteries.<br /><br />I ordered two sets of five batteries,... literally a lifetime supply for my Energizer LED Trail Finder Cap light  :-)
B004FP1WX0|3.0|This movie is basically good. The character development is slow and at times I got somewhat bored with some of the details of each character's personality. We are asked to get into the minds of the characters to go along with what is possibly a common occurrence, internet lying on chat sites. In this case on a grand scale. However, as the movie slowly unravels we can get lost in a not so dynamic story before we get to the action which is for us to suspect a seduction and to suspect the extent of it. The title comes from a somewhat unknown function of catfish in the fishing industry and is made clear late in the film.  It's not a great movie but it is a good movie to watch if you can be patient.
0385344228|4.0|Interesting topic and look into the relationship of parents and children. I especially liked HOW the author told the story: multiple timeframes but not in a way that was confusing. It was neat to have a story told this way, rather than from simply start to finish. You won't be disappointed in purchasing this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|As you progress through the ever-increasing-difficulty of levels, you exercise your strategy and problem solving abilities!  Very engaging and fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is an exceptional show and I can't wait for season 4.  I also loved Lark Rise to Candleford and London Hospital.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|The book was poorly written, repetitive and was more about author's ego.<br />I couldn't finish it and cannot recommend it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|We enjoy playing this game either with our grandkids or alone while waiting for something to be done. It is a great stress buster!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Good show...got all the seasons :) I would recommend this to any one who likes crime shows<br />I don't think you will be disappointed
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Without going in to great detail, its what you expect, incredible stories of what this highly trained soldier did, how it impacted himself, his family, and other troops with him.  I enjoyed it and was glued to the book for the day and a half it took me to whip through it.  It will have you laugh, smile, cringe, and maybe even shed a tear - especially knowing how he was killed.<br />Get it and enjoy it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love public television and this series is outstanding.  Some say it is a soap opera but I find the characters and the time period very entertaining.  Can't wait for season 4.
B003L77G10|4.0|Just finished watching series 1 & 2 and cannot wait to start on series 3. I did not make mistake buying 3 seasons at once at least i do not have to wait in TV when they will aire the next episode.<br /><br />I love it and more likely be buying the series 4 soon.<br /><br />DVD came in time and in very good condition.<br /><br />Thanks and will buy again at Amazon.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I got this for my dad's birthday because he is a huge fan.  We did have some issues with the last discs on a few of the seasons but figured out that it was my parents' bluray player and not the discs.  They all worked fine on my older playstation 3.  So we figure that technology is just getting too advanced for itself.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I am a 24 year old male. I never got bought the Nintendo DS because Nintendo usually caters to younger crowds with titles like Mario, Animal Crossing, etc. Sure, those games are fun, but by going with a Nintendo console, you are usually limiting to non M-rated games - its hard to find games on Nintendo consoles that cater to my demographic.<br /><br />However.... its been a long time since a game appealed to me this much.<br /><br />That being said, the themes in The Zero Escape series are much darker than most M-rated games offered anywhere on any console. The maturity of this game goes far beyond the Shin Megami Tensei series. Many of the endings will leave you haunted for some time and are absolutely unforgettable - Something akin to Lucy ripping apart the group of bullies in Elfen Lied, or the various plot threads in 'When they Cry'. The intelligent themes are on par with the anime series 'Steins; Gate'. I'm actually very surprised this game did not gain popularity in Japan. That being said, it was a bit more successful in America.<br /><br />I noticed there were some good titles coming out for the Nintendo 3DS (Fire Emblem: Awakening, Monster Hunter, RE: Revelations, Some Shin Megami Tensei games), so I picked up a 3DS XL. I noticed that one of the more popular games was Hero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. I read a little about it and found it interesting. I realized that 999 was the first in the series. I wasn't sure at first about playing a game from the previous generation. I also don't tend to like the 'find your way out of the room' sort of games. My opinion of them in the past was that they were boring. But you don't really play this game for those puzzles...<br /><br />You play it for the story, which is incredible. I am so glad that I decided to pick this up. It is so different, intelligent, immersive, and haunting. It doesn't take long. 15 minutes into the game you will be addicted as the story starts out fairly fast paced. The character wakes up on a boat that is sinking and needs to escape. As the story progresses you find other people and begin to understand what is going on with the group of people.<br /><br />The follow up game is also fairly great. Its a completely different experience and is just as good. Maybe not as haunting, but definitely as addicting. I suggest you pick them both up and give them a try, starting with 999. You will be happy that you didn't pass up this wonderful gem of a game.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox is AWESOME. It is definiely my favorite app lately.<br />The ease of transfering the information I need is so quick.<br />Thank you!!!
1451629192|5.0|First of all, this book is hard to read. There are things that you would never imagine unless you read it from a victim that was held captive during 18 years. In the book you can actually see the level of the mental manipulation Jaycee went through. It is really amazing how a person that endured so much abuse for so long time still have love in her inside, is so protective to her children, and is doing a lot of thing to help others. Also you can learn how government agent mistakes can lead to such an evil end.  I read some people saying that the book was boring, just about her cats, that goes back and forward....yes, the book goes back and forward and have some grammar typos and have many pages about cats and sometimes repeat some stories.....but this is is the way a person who reached fifth grade and was held captive and raped hundred of times wanted to write the book. She was left alone in a dark room for so many time....so what do you expect from that situation? An interesting and well designed story?  I think some people should rethink their principles.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Since I did not purchase this for myself, It will be hard for me to comment.<br />However, my grandkids love it and play with it often.<br />I haven't any suggestions at this time.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|On the plus side, this book did keep me interested. I did read it quickly. And I was entertained. However, overall, I didn't like the story.<br /><br />First, I thought the bet was stupid. If he bet her a kiss or something like that, ok. Second, it was just weird for me how mister womanizing Travis sees her at the end of a fight and suddenly he is in love with her.  Third, I hated the nickname. For one, it was annoying. But also, it never really explains it. Just out of nowhere the first time he sees her he calls her pigeon.  I thought for sure it had some past significance, but nope, it was just some weird nickname he tries to explain away very briefly later on, and makes no sense.  On top of that, I didn't really like Travis's character. He was extremely violent, had an alcohol problem (like every time he was upset he got drunk), and he was so clingy and emotionally dependent on her so quickly. And of course when he doesn't get his way, or something he doesn't like happens (that wasn't necessarily indicative of something bad), he reacts violently and just flips his s*** over it.<br /><br />I also found the whole story line implausible and thrown together. Like the author didn't really know where she was going with it when she started and kept throwing stuff in to make it good. Dating another guy while she is living with and sleeping in the bed of another? Another who is obviously attracted to her? Unlikely. I feel like the other guy wanting to date her would just wait until she was done living with Travis.  The whole being a gambler's daughter and mob thing was just completely outlandish and did not fit the story well. We all realized she was running from something. Was she running from the mob (which would make more sense at least)? No, she as running from being a famous gambler's daughter. Oh, and she just so happens to fall in love with a guy whose family is a bunch of gambling experts and discover her identity. Because there are just tons of those people around. Even my dad who watched and played tons of pool (and went to Vegas for tournaments) and watched poker would not recognize a famous player's daughter. So that was kind of dumb. Then the whole father showing up, going to Vegas and gambling thing was even more stupid. And the way it all played out was even more stupid, if that is possible.  Especially since it is just thrown in there. On top of that, add in that she has secretly betting on Travis's fights and wiping people clean, even more stupid (again, if that is possible). Then we add in the little mob bit, which goes over surprisingly smoothly for dealing with the mob. And then once Travis makes his decision regarding all of that, the mob just leaves them alone and they stroll off into the sunset to argue about trust issues and crap.  That's it.  No more mention of Vegas and the mob. It was just thrown in there for some conflict.<br /><br />Then later on we go through the whole fire thing. And I am trying to give away as few details as possible here, but I may go into total spoiler alert mode in this paragraph, so skip this paragraph if you care.  Hey we escaped this horrible fire, TONS of people are dead. Instead of going to the hospital, talking to police, finding out if anyone we know died (since we are involved with this same group of people for fights all this time), let's just run off to Vegas and suddenly get married.  And the end.  For one, the whole fire thing should have been a little more traumatic for them. I was really hoping to read more about it. I could imagine them huddled in front of the tv dealing with the after effects for weeks. I mean the effects would be long lasting. But no. They run off to Vegas and get married and it is like it never happened.<br /><br />On to my next point: I hated the ending. They grew very little in their relationship, they grew very little individually, said aw screw it, we will learn to deal with it, and on they went.  The ending was very abrupt and left a lot to be desired. there were so many loose ends not wrapped up for me.<br /><br />In the end, it was entertaining, some parts were hot, but overall it was a mess. I did not really enjoy it once I was through and I kept yelling at her to leave him, because although she was annoying, he was bad news. He was not your typical protective jealous alpha male from romance novels. He was just a violent emotionally unstable mess.  I will most likely not be reading the sequel, which as I understand is everything from his view point instead, rather than a continuation of the story.  It is uncommon for me to not read a sequel. Even if I don't like the characters, I usually want to see how the trainwreck unfolds.<br /><br />I say pass it up. Although at the very least it is the best of all the novels that have tried to copy it. All of the copycats suck even more. I give it two stars for at least keeping me entertained.e desired. there were so many loose ends not wrapped up for me.<br /><br />In the end, it was entertaining, some parts were hot, but overall it was a mess.

B004QL7K6Q|5.0|Everyone seems to be typing such long reviews here.  Why?  Who has the time to sit and read you 40 page thesis paper on Wanderlust?<br /><br />Point is if you have that feeling that a really great comedy hasn't come out for a while, you'll love Wanderlust, for relief's sake if nothing else.  It's a good movie; it's a well made movie; the acting is strong and the characters are round, but most importantly, it's funny.  Someone below said \\"it's a good rainy day movie\\".  No.  It's just a funny movie.  Not rolling in the aisles clutching your sides funny, but well-written, good joke, Arrested Development funny.<br /><br />Also Jen Aniston is still a total babe, which has to be some kind of Guinness World Record.
B00B4Z5J92|2.0|The film works as a historical piece but the premises of some of the participants are based on flawed assumptions. Here are a few:<br /><br />1) Digital recording makes it too easy to \\"fix\\" or manipulate things and this causes the finished product to lack \\"humanity\\".<br /><br />First of all, since the dawn of multi-track recording decades ago, it has always been possible to fix things with studio trickery. Overdubbing, punching in multiple times, \\"comping\\" multiple takes together into one, re-recording individual parts dozens of times until they are \\"right\\" or having session players come and just play the instruments outright. All of these techniques have been used extensively over the years.<br /><br />The choice to do these things or not rests with the artist. If someone wants to do things organically with a band in a room laying down the tracks live that can be done with digital as well. Digital makes it easier to fix things, but I would argue that allows the artist to focus more on the songs and less on the complexities of the recording process. You have to be quite the rocket scientist to mix on a Neve console, not so with digital recording.<br /><br />2) Analog recording (and the Neve console in particular) sounds better than digital.<br /><br />This isn't true anymore and what sounds \\"good\\" is highly subjective. The Neve might sound different but it isn't necessarily better. Someone with a good pair of ears can make things sound good as long as the gear being used is at least decent. Someone with crummy ears and technical expertise won't get a good sound using a Neve either.<br /><br />The premise put forth in this film is that everything that came out of Sound City sounded great. That isn't true either. Some of those old albums stand up well sonically and some don't. Obviously most of the recordings were \\"good enough\\" to get on the radio at the time.<br /><br />3) The fact that \\"anyone\\" can lay down professional sounding recordings is a bad thing.<br /><br />Not everyone in this doc says this outright but some do and others imply it. Digital recording has been a GREAT thing for artists, but the music BUSINESS was upset by it. In the days when places like Sound City dominated, you had to be signed to a big label to record there because of the expense. Only a chosen few had deals like that.<br /><br />They got big advances to record, the program directors at radio stations got paid off to put their songs in heavy rotation and the label made sure MTV played the videos. This was a great system for people like Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, et al. It made them rich and famous. Who it wasn't great for is struggling artists who didn't have a major record deal. They couldn't afford to get a decent sounding recording or have anyone play it.<br /><br />Nowadays digital recording has empowered average people with musical ability to do quality recordings. They can immediately promote those songs on the Internet or with outlets like iTunes inexpensively. Does this mean alot of stuff gets put out that isn't up to snuff? Yes. However, there are thousands of smaller time acts that DO put out amazing music that would never have been heard under the old system.<br /><br />I would argue the indie bands of today are putting out music far more interesting than the crap the \\"professional\\" artists in this documentary were playing toward the end of the film. There were some great albums that came out when the big labels ruled. However, there was alot of crap too and other worthy artists couldn't even get an audience.<br /><br />In the final analysis the songs are the main thing. Using a Neve console and a 2 inch 24 track Studer deck might be cool but it won't make the music better. A good song is good even if it is recorded with 1 mic and a cassette deck. Recording a great song with digital gear won't make it bad either. What Dave Grohl has done is set up an analog recording museum. It is nice that he preserved a piece of music history. He has themoney to spend on a vanity project like that.<br /><br />Meanwhile there are thousands of musicians who dream just as big recording songs into their laptops with hopes of producing great music. Thanks to digital recording their chance of gaining an audience is better than ever. I am one of those people myself. When I was a young musician starting out, it was impossible to access the market unless you had connections. If you lived in the wrong town you could forget it. I am glad those days are gone.

It would be even color if it wasn't cheaply painted on color and if his head moved from side to side or the red light glowed.  He was simple to install, no hassle to work and he's ready to help any time I need him.  He makes little sounds when you plug in a USB thumb drive and the demo switch has been over-used by my 5 year old ... so I am all too familiar with each beep and boop the lil guy makes.  Overall, he's Artoo.  He's on my desk to do what he's supposed to do.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|For those that could not see the foreclosures coming, this is a real education.  This details how the rating agencies and mortgage lenders colluded to compile risky mortgages into securities where trash was labeled AAA and sold to unsuspecting investors who believed they were investing  with virtually no risk.<br />A few saw it all coming, and found a way to make big money betting against common expectations.<br />This book is a great read, and as someone who WAS offered a no doc, money back, no interest for the first year, choose your own payments mortgage, it explained to me how someone could have made such an incredibly stupid mortgage offer and thought it would not lead to disaster.
B004WJRTXG|4.0|So this is \\"Lad Lit\\"... I like it.<br /><br />Interesting story line and despite the fact that it's all very sad, it's really quite an uplifting book.  Doug is extremely likeable as are all the other characters in the book - especially sister Clare and his mom.  And Doug's dad too...<br /><br />If I had to sum it up, it's a story about life - and death - and family.  It's a page turner in that it reads well and easy and you want to know what's going to happen next.<br /><br />Quote from the book from Doug's mom - who is dealing with her own form of grief even though her husband is not yet dead.<br /><br />\\"It's life, that's all.  There are no happy endings.  Just happy days, happy moments.  The only real ending is death and trust me, no one dies happy.  And the price of not dying is that things change all the time and the only thing you can count on is that there's not a thing you can do about it.\\"<br /><br />Spoiler Alert... And having said that, I was happy with this ending in that had it all ended on a happy note, it would not have been real.  Doug needs to move on but he also needs to heal.  It's an ending which offers hope.
B003I55BIA|3.0|I can see the appeal that this story has.  Sexy Mexican boy falling for stereotypical blonde princess, and vice versa.  It was entertaining and I finished it in one sitting.  It could have used more, I enjoyed how the characters opened up to each other and felt that initial &#34;chemistry&#34; but several of the other primary characters were underdeveloped.  The prologue was a bit of a stretch for me, I am sure that the younger readers would enjoy this aspect, but I didn't need the fancy bow tie up at the end.<br /><br />This is a story that lightly covers heavy materials, so if you are looking for a surface romance that has a beginning middle and end, this is a good choice.  If you are looking for something deeper, this is not the boom for you.

B008M7JODC|5.0|Let me begin by letting everyone know that growing up I was a huge X-Files fan and was sad to see the show leave the air.  When Fringe first hit the scene I was skeptical because I really thought it was going to be about Vampires or teen Werewolves, simply because of the popularity of shows like Twilight and True Blood.  I could not have been more wrong however!<br /><br />Fringe is built around Olivia (Anna Torv) who is an FBI agent investigating mysterious &#34;Fringe&#34; cases.  She works with a team consisting of another FBI analyst Astrid, a forgetful yet brilliant scientist Walter, and Walter's son Peter.  Through science, gun fights, and the right amount of federal power, this group solves these Fringe crimes.  There is a larger threat in this world however and how that unfolds is the real meat of this show.  Without giving too much away I will simply say that they overall ARC, which carries through all five seasons, involves a universal threat from multiple angles.<br /><br />Fringe is not a show to be missed and with it being available for FREE to Prime members there has really never been a better time to get started.  The fifth season releases on May 7th so you still have enough time to get through the first four, which will consume all of your free time, trust me :-)
B000Q67876|5.0|I love this movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a great job sending the viewer into a dark world. I recommend reading the book before seeing this. This is one of the few times the book and movie are close to par.<br /><br />Add this movie to your wishlist and watch the price jump around. I added it at $27 and later bought it for $8. Then it went right back up. So keep it on the wishlist and buy it when it drops.
B000O599ZS|5.0|In the works of Indo-European literature there is a hero who stands outside his society, but fights viciously for it.  This hero never gets the comfort of a regular life and instead follows his fate to the end.  Siegfried, Achilles, Hercules, etc. fit this motif.  In The Searchers, Ethan (John Wayne) plays this role.<br /><br />The story of The Searchers comes from a true story-a Comanche raid which killed a Texas family and snatch a little girl-Cynthia Ann Parker- who is held captive for many years.  Parker's story is not unique in the early history of Texas, especially following the Civil War northern Texas was under severe threat from Indians.  In 1956, when The Searchers was made, there were still a few old-timers around that remembered Comanche raids.  Even (Senator in 1956) Lyndon Baines Johnson's family had suffered from Comanche Raids.<br /><br />Cynthia Ann Parker turned out to be successfully integrated into the Comanche Tribe, but she was an exception. Men and older women were killed outright or tortured to death at the time of capture, surviving girls were raped, tortured and disfigured after being returned to the Indian Camp.  The girls would also be made to toil with no end.  Thomas Goodrich, in his book Scalp Dance: Indian Warfare on the High Plains, 1865-1879 called his chapter on captivity &#34;A Fate Worse than Death.&#34;<br /><br />Texans during the Indian War days knew this and The Searchers excellently captures the fear and hatred of the times.  Ethan enters the story as a heroic man alone in the first scene.  He never surrendered with the Confederate Army and seems to live by robbery.  He hates Indians with the hatred of a warrior who has fought them head-on before.  He even rudely tests the racial loyalties of 1/8th Cherokee, Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) while at dinner with his family.<br /><br />The Comanche eventually lure the Rangers away from a settlement and kill Ethan's brother's family, leading the girls into captivity.  This is a scene of acting excellence.  The audience feels the fear of the family and the attack happens without showing the Indians, or indeed showing anything scary whatsoever, yet the suspense is heavy.<br /><br />Suffice to say the girls are captured and Ethan and Martin head on a quest to rescue Debbie, the lone survivor.<br /><br />During the quest, the nature of conflict is richly explored.  The Red-White conflict is an un-reserved fight, much like the American-Japanese conflict of the Pacific War.  The oldest captured white girl is raped and killed.  The pursuing whites mutilate bodies of fallen Comanche, the US Cavalry crashes into Indian villages shooting with no mercy, Ethan's motivations seem more to kill Indianized Debbie as much as redeem her.  The heroes also have conflicts-but muted conflicts-with other whites, Ethan's relationship with the Texas Rangers is one of barely avoiding arrest. Ethan kills a treacherous merchant, and Martin fights another man for the hand of a woman.  Through this, the conflicting and impulsive internal motives of Ethan surface and clash, making a darkly layered character.<br /><br />The Searchers is the last of the Westerns where the Indians are unreservedly portrayed as savages.  After 1960, Americans had no living recollection of the Indian Wars, and were instead softened by prosperity and beguiled by an elitist media ambivalent at best about the security of Americans like the whites portrayed in the movie.  After The Searchers, movies started to portray Indians as noble heroes or righteous victims of oppression.  Not until aircraft started to crash into buildings and Islamic Terrorists began posting beheadings on the internet did the older view of Indians start to get a revision.<br /><br />In the final scene Ethan's special aloneness returns.  Debbie is carried into the doors of civilization by her loving neighbors and kinsmen while Ethan stands alone, outside, forever in the wilderness. His fate sealed.acting excellence.

B001TOIW5G|5.0|An absolute classic and must have for any audiophiles out there. There is nothing quite like The Monks. Do a little research on these guys and you'll be all the more fascinated by them. American G.I.s stationed in Germany during the Vietnam war who made music WAY ahead of it's time. There's awesome early distortion on some of the tracks, killer harmonies on others and ALWAYS catchy. Many have said this is the first punk album ever (1966) and I can't disagree. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this record.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I purchased this book because I was going to see the movie and wanted to read it before I saw the movie.  I didn't have time to finish the book before I saw the movie but wanted to read it anyway.  I am glad I did!  The book as always is nothing like the movie.  It is very different and I enjoyed reading it.  The  only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it kind of dragged on at times.  There was a lot of repeating in the character building of the main character's husband.  But it was a good book over all and it was better than the movie!

B008220DIC|5.0|Many people seem to shoot down \\"The Master\\" by saying things such as it's boring, too long and there's no clear story line. These reviewers are probably too accustomed to movies that spoon feed us answers within the story. It is understandable why a person would come out of this movie a bit frustrated, but a second viewing with a sharp eye catches a lot of subtle detail, and that's what makes a great script/film. How much can you say without actually saying it? \\"The Master\\" says so much without giving too much away; the film develops a voice using the character's actions and film techniques. Its direction and cinematography, the latter by Mihai Malaimare Jr., literally mirrors Phoenix and Hoffman's characters extremely well. Speaking of which, the acting is amazing, Daniel Day-Lewis' performance in \\"Lincoln\\" was definitely inferior to Phoenix's in \\"The Master\\". I do agree with people in that Amy Adams was underused, however, I also believe that her character could have ruined the film or herself if she was used too often. Maybe it was safe to under use her to preserve the film.<br />  I have always compared movies to books. There are symbols, not only in the form of objects but camera angles, use of space and the juxtaposition of scene. In other words, movies are thought provoking and shouldn't just give you the answers to all your question without giving you a second to think for yourself. This movie challenges you to escape the classic Hollywood style film. A side note: The Blu-Ray version of this film looks amazing (It's my personal favorite Blu-Ray movie) and the soundtrack goes well with the film.
B009PHRIEA|5.0|If the music is what matters most to you, then the Original Album Series line has a lot to offer.  Minimalist packaging may turn off some fans, but the sound quality is there.  With this entry OAS captures a fine musician across five albums.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|The AccuRadio app is pretty good. It is simple and free. Basically like your average radio station except with a skip button. It seems pretty fast and stable with relatively few ads.<br /><br />With that said however, I can't give it 5 stars. It lacks important customization functionality found in their website player that did not make it to their app which is truly disappointing considering how many years they have been working on this. And the sound quality could use an improvement.<br /><br />All in all it works well on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Most of the features from the web player have now made it into the app. You can now make mix channels made up of your favorite channels, including the ability to see what songs and artists you have banned. I am amending my rating to 5 stars.

0007447868|4.0|The Setup: This book is the next in the series of aSoIaF, following A Storm of Swords. Much has been made about how SLOW this book reads, and how it's full of characters that we've never met before. Also, many of the transitions from aSoS are not resolved; here it's mostly MORE setup! Now in my opinion, aSoS is simply THE most exciting, plot and character-rich novel I've ever read. It is a pinnacle of plot-driven, whodunnit and treacherous storytelling. It serves as the climax of the 1st half of the overall story.<br />The Result: No matter how good aFFC is, it simply CAN'T measure up to the previous book in any meaningful way. Remember this. I wish I'd understood that before I picked it up the first time; I was severely underwhelmed like many have expressed. By page 600-700 I was frustrated and gnashing my teeth.....but that was MY problem, really. I can imagine how the people coming from watching the TV show and reading aFFC for the first time will HATE this book.<br />But that's just it. The point of this book is not to ramp up to some 'super-exciting mega climax bigger than the last!\\" in one book like some stupid Hollywood sequel. Guilty as charged: In my anticipation of excitement and plot resolve, I WASN'T REALLY READING THIS BOOK VERY WELL. I was reading to find out what happens next, instead of reading to soak up the knowledge of the plot and characters and how they all fit like a puzzle. Nothing made this mistake more abundantly clear to me than when upon my 2nd reading, I noticed how the 1st chapter ties in with the last. It's BRILLIANT, and I missed it completely the first because I was approaching the books with a 'what next?', anticipatory mind, rather than as a patient observer of events with great implications; which is closer to the spirit of the books and overall series as a whole, anyway.<br />And that is just the point - STORM was the exception/climax to Martin's style NOT the rule/reward - which becomes abundantly clear upon closer reading.<br />After reading a second time, my only criticisms of the book is the length of the Brienne chapters. She simply doesn't do enough to warrant more than a couple of chapters here. The Arys Oakheart chapter could have been folded into another Martell chapter just as well. Roughly 20-30 pages of \\"borderline non-adventure\\" could have been summarized in a paragraph or three, and the book wouldn't have missed them.<br />In many ways FEAST is the best book of the series, in terms of understanding the characters and what drives them and why. The Arya, Sam, Jaime and Oldtown chapters are all richly told, with lots to chew on before you read Dance.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I'm not really a minecraft person&hellip; but this game is pretty awsome. I'm really good at creating places&hellip; but the time is to short to finish my places :( if u got ps3 add me&hellip; my name Half_pint_king
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thought this was just another gory scary show but it not. I'm in love with the characters and the story line brings me back week by week... Who knew such a format would bring the success it has. The Walking Dead is my favorite show. I never miss an episode thanks to Amazon!!
B006DHAT5K|5.0|This movie is one of our favorites.  If you are looking for a good laugh, &#34;What's Your Number,&#34; won't let you down.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Whether you are a line manager, individual contributor or executive level - this story is a great one that is easily to consume and understand.  It's told in the same voice/position as the The Goal, by Goldratt - but this one is aimed squarely at IT Professionals.  Others may criticize this for glossing over some of the nitty gritty details required to completely revamp business processes - but let's be honest - if the book told those stories it would put Ambien out of business.
B003PIUC02|5.0|excellent serie i just finish and i want to see the others rigth now, it has all in one history, sex, action.
B000GKW4HG|5.0|Seriously the best replica dinos on the market, and for a reasonable price. I use these for teaching. I would not let my students play with them. But if your kids are dino fanatics, and they can be gentle with them, they will enjoy Papo dinosaurs.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This neat and durable watch is so sweet and smooth with it's accurate time keeping movement! I love this watch and the great deal I picked it up for so dirt cheap! I will cherish this time piece for years to come!
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Not for little kids.  It is so weird, that you spend the entire movie answering annoying, unanswerable questions.  Slightly entertaining for adults though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great and very addictive game. My whole family plays it. Very well created and once again, very addictive.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|I want to start by saying I am a huge Ethan Hawke fan, and I feel he has never received the credit he is due as an artist. I was not sure what to make of this movie at first, as I played it upon arrival but was really not in the mood to watch it.  So I put it away and played it again much later and over and over. This is a fantastic &#34;horror&#34; movie not only in its ability to keep you spellbound, but also in its ability to make you think. It also the affect which PYSCHO has on most people (well at least in 1961 when I saw it) and that is the gore you think you see is not really there...it is your imagination run wild.<br /><br />Hawke plays his role very close to the vest and very calculated. His angst rises in a slow manner until the movies climax. His pre-climatic scares are extremely believable in context of the movie plot. No screams or horrors which are not appropriate (unlike many horror movies).  The story lines continues to unfold with unexpected twists and turns, while Hawke takes us closer and closer to his unknowing abyss.<br /><br />The production and execution is believable and the other characters are well developed, particularly Deputy So-and So and Hawke's wife. Once again their quiet unease develops slowly and over time but in a believable manner. The story and horror are featured in such a way that there are no actual gory scenes, and those ideas are strictly left to the viewer. The psychological component is what makes this movie a GREAT horror flick.<br /><br />There are &#34;horror&#34; movies and there are &#34;horror&#34; movies. One relies on actual scenes, blood and carnage to makes its point. There is a place in film for that. But the truly good and great horror films rely on your imagination to work...SINISTER does just that.
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|Just see it.  What you do not want to do is spend another minute reading reviews or analyses of Holy Motors.  They're only likely to give you spoilers or preconceptions, and although the film is well worth watching more than once, I would not want anyone to miss the type of first-time experience that I had:  just strolling into an art-house theater, knowing nothing about the movie, and wow.<br /><br />There are at least ten scenes, any one of which is itself worth the money and the time spent viewing, because you will not forget them.  And NO, don't go sneaking selected peeks on YouTube.  Buy or rent the whole thing.  Or see it on the big screen at a theater near you, if possible, then procure it online if desired.  I am not into Best Picture of the Year awards or top-ten lists.  There are lots of good movies to see.  But as a person of eclectic tastes, I do have a list of films that have stayed with me.  They range from foreign films like Jesus of Montreal, Pan's Labyrinth, and The Return of Martin Guerre to American mainstreamers like Saturday Night Fever and Ace Ventura Pet Detective (one of the great works of American cinema), to non-mainstreamers like Henry Fool (another one) ... and now, most definitely, don't miss it folks, Holy Motors.
B001AQMBHI|4.0|This is the only FINAL DESTINATION (FD) that is worth anything...the remaining movies of the franchise are nowhere near up to the original.  The concept and execution of the film, in terms of story, is excellent. It is one of the more original \\"horror\\" movies in that there is not an \\"actual killer\\" but the concept of a killer in death. I would have given this 5 Stars, except there are so many continuity issues with the film that is is hard to believe that Wong or the editor of the film did not discover them.<br /><br />First, let's look at the actual explosion of the plane. As the \\"model\\" of the plane \\"explodes\\" (this is when they are all in the terminal after Alex had his \\"vision\\") a real plane would disintegrate in a matter of seconds.  In this shot, there are \\"flames\\" in the sky as the plane \\"explodes\\" yet the plane for the entire shot it is in one piece then suddenly vanishes. This is a major error on reality, and in a scene like this there can not be any \\"poetic license.\\"<br /><br />Second, the memorial scene.  As they all walk up to pay their respects, the kid in the background who is singing and playing guitar is not always doing either.  He is suppose to be the person you hear through the entire scene yet in some shots you hear him, but  as the camera touches on him at times, he is doing neither. Again, I understand \\"poetic license\\" but this should have been caught by Wong or the editor.  My assumption is the did not plan on someone looking at and stopping the movie to look at the details.<br /><br />Third, Terri's death scene with the bus.  This is the most blatant. Prior to her \\"death\\" you see Alex and Clear sitting outside the coffee house on the corner where Terri is to be killed.  CLEARLY across the street the road is closed due to construction. So there is no traffic coming in a perpendicular direction from where they are sitting.  When Terri gets \\"hit by the bus\\" the bus is clearly coming at a straight line (meaning on the closed street), as no bus can make a turn at that speed and not tip over. While a great scene it is totally inaccurate.  I will deal with a suspension of disbelief but to a point...this scene is totally inaccurate and skewed in such a way that it is hard to believe Wong (and remember this is his first Directorial debut) could really miss this.<br /><br />There are several others as the film progresses, but I think you get the idea.  I really do love this movie (I know it is hard to believe by this review) and I would have given it five stars had it not been for these issues and several others in terms of continuity and accuracy.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Still Love this series. As good as the first season. I feel a must see. Clean of bad language and sexual content. Excellant veiwing. Execellant educationally showing how ruff it really was in the past.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Purchased this movie after it was released in movie theathers years ago and my daugher took it when she moved.  We loved the movie verison, as it helped supply story background that could be missed during the live play performance (which we have seen many times).  Was pleasantly surprised to find a Blu-Ray version when looking to replace the original movie.  Would recommend to all Phantom of the Opera fans.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Maybe it is so great because I know way to many people that are like this, but the comedy and punch lines keep this movie at the top of some of my most quotable movies.
B0086700CM|2.0|Game looked great, but unfortunately it gave me motion sickness.  Recommend for people who are not bothered by motion sickness.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I loved this game. Straight addicted but it is glitching up and wont let me sign into facebook anymore. I have reinstalled it five time and restarted my phone. No change.  Please fix this
B00BCA29WY|1.0|The only word that encapsulates the contents of this music is lousy. I don't know where this band is coming from, I don't get it. Some kind of ethereal, spiritual gobbledy goop that was borderline Christian music or something to my ears anyway. Lousy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My son has really enjoyed all of Rick Riordan's books!!  Well worth getting any of his books for your young people!!! :D
B00122S5Z2|5.0|if you're a Robert plant fan you will like this one. Way different from Led Zeppelin, buy it, try it!
B008GWSS6W|5.0|Sure wish the Duke was still around, great actor and good person. I don't have anything but good things to say about this movie.
B000E33VWW|3.0|Hoffman's performance is perfect. The problem with the movie IMO is Clifton Collins as Perry Smith. This was the role played by a very young Robert Blake in 1967 in the very good Richard Brooks film. Blake captures the complexity of this extremely complicated murderer - for instance, the rage simmering just below the I-want-to-impress-you-with-my-vocabulary surface. Collins doesn't do nearly as well, his performance is flat, sort of wilted, we don't see that glimmer of Satan that Blake was able to produce. (If I remember correctly, Blake got way, way into the role, to the point where he became self-destructive.) Perry Smith is one of the biggest acting challenges of modern movies. In \\"Capote\\" it's a huge role. The conversations between him and Capote in the jail cell are the core of the film. Too often they're a bit boring; Hoffman holds up his end but we don't find ourselves all that interested in Collins. But, with all of that said, the film is worth seeing for Hoffman's work.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I read a quote the other day about British television being the best and I have to agree.  Whether it is MI-5 (Spooks) or Foyle's War, or Downton Abbey or Doc Martin, the viewer can expect to be taken on a journey to another place and time and be totally absorbed by the characters and location. I certainly enjoy my favorites on US TV, but there is something about British TV that captures me.
B009JCL58G|5.0|I enjoyed the movie so much, owning the soundtrack was a must. I turn it on while driving through rush hour to ease my road rage. Beautiful music
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am all about some good smut, but this had a bit too much and lacked plot. Anastasia and Christians mood swings became annoying. One minute they are arguing the next &#34;how can I resist him when he smiles&#34;. No thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really great game it keeps making it better by moving cities and getting new characters and boards and I would definitely be a great game to donload
B000OLGCI4|5.0|If you have not experienced the magic that is the Jungle Book you should be ashamed of yourself! As a grown woman of 24, not only did I grow up singing these songs, but I continue to sing them. at work. at my colleagues desk. with my colleague. who happens to be my mother's age. just for the sake of being silly. in the middle of the week. mostly the afternoon.<br /><br />One is never too old to enjoy this Bare Necessity of animation. Indulge me, please. I'm your friend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just heard about this series from a friend.  We watched the whole first season in 2 days.  We will be through all 3 seasons very shortly.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|A good weekend read with a couple plot twists. Wish the authors had been a bit more descriptive regarding tunnels.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|I wish they could reverse aging and bring back Roger Moore. At least he had personality and charm. If I wanted to watch someone just beat up other guys, I'd watch Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible. I expect more from Bond. This movie was a waste of my time and money. Avoid it!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|After spending a semester in England and working my way through my various English suitors, I was introduced to the concept of Baby Making Music. The xx proved incredible for appropriate background music for various tasks, including but not limited to: studying, cleaning, baby-making, and late night chats.<br /><br />Having since returned to the United States, I met the band in a small little venue and found them to be very pleasant individuals. Their slow tunes are only amplified for their live performance.<br /><br />These tunes are now included in additional playlists including: Bubble Bath and Cry Myself to Sleep as I Regret My Decisions.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really loved this book. It was a little hard to get the characters straight in my head at first but this story is so real that one has to believe that it was, indeed, spoon fed to the author just as she says! I did not want it to end but I loved especially that it was not all syrupy endings for the players in the story. It was a dose of reality from the get go. The worst part was that at the end, I wanted more of Kathleen Grissom and unhappily, there is no more so I hope she is hard at work on her next novel which I will purchase as soon as it hits the shelf!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Meet Isabella Swan... err... maybe not. This naughty Twilight fanfiction turned novel is a good distraction when one needs a simple, naughty read. Writing style is mediocre, but does one need to be crazy when saying, &#34;He pressed himself against my thigh. My inner goddess squealed in delight.&#34;
B0091MW50G|4.0|It's only highlights from 20 operas. But well done, good sound and vision. The video production is limited due the stage size. I wanted this disc for use it as catalogue of the Collection.
B005PWPUW6|2.0|I used this product with my TV because of the limited outputs, sent to nice computer speakers, worked well, then the power just cut out and I can't fix it.  Bummer... I'm buying the OREI product instead.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|It is an important step in the process of ebook publishing that cuts to the chase. I recommend this to anyone interested in ebook publishing
B003XF1OJK|5.0|The book is amazing there a lot of action with plenty of strategies in space combat overalls amazing book I would recommend it to anyone who has or hasn't played the game
B00499QUK2|4.0|I did not purchase this movie, I just watched it on Amazon.  I like Sherlock, this young Sherlock is good. I would recommend.
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|Picked this up at Best Buy, where it is \\"exclusive.\\"  The MSRP on this is $50, so I'm not sure why anyone would pay closer to $80 with shipping and all that.<br /><br />It's just the movies, no special features or anything.  Comes in a convenient extra thick bluray case (standard height, thicker to accommodate the extra discs).<br /><br />Clearly the sellers here are scalping a few copies.  If you can wait a week or two I'm sure Best Buy will have these restocked.  Also anticipating other \\"versions\\" of the complete Twilight saga to be released to other stores.  Find it hard to believe that Best Buy will get the ONLY box set to be released ever.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What more can I say? I ordered this, along with Seasons 1 and 2. I will continue to have this series in my DVD collection.
B00475BUVM|5.0|Great movie bundled with the first installment. Well worth it!! Would by it again if I had to for any reason.
1427233748|4.0|MR. PENUMBRA'S 24-HOUR BOOKSTORE by Robin  Sloan read by Ari Fliakos is an interesting mystery/suspense/thriller. This is the audio version. It is a compelling story of conspiracy, young love,adventure,secrets,code-breaking,and high-tech data all set,of all places, in a bookstore. An intriguing story, told with a voice easy to listen too,and heartfelt. *Don't have young children with you when you listen to this story,though*. Simply intriguing! \\"Robin Sloan pays homage to the virtues of the audiobook in the plot and created a bonus clue exclusively for the audiobook\\".\\"Sloan also makes a cameo appearance,narrating the audiobook-within-the-audiobook in the story!\\" An interesting audiobook and one I would recommend to listen to if you enjoy thrillers,suspense,and mystery. Received for an honest review from the publisher.<br /><br />RATING: 4<br /><br />REVIEWED BY: AprilR, My Book Addiction Reviews
B007XF0X6G|5.0|Great movie bundled with the first installment. Well worth it!! Would by it again if I had to for any reason.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|Porcupine Tree have been my favorite band for most of the last ten years, and when Steven Wilson first started going solo, I was bummed. What would happen to my precious Porcupine Tree?<br /><br />I no longer care. The Raven That Refused to Sing is the best thing he's ever released. The songs are beautiful, both musically and lyrically. The musicianship is jaw dropping. Even the packaging on this 2LP gatefold release is gorgeous and well constructed.<br /><br />Buy this now, and thank me later.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great purchase for my 3D collection. One of the highest rated 3D movies to date. Worth my money in so many ways.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|For a free app this is really good. Basic indicator is fine but additional breakdown (music, video, web etc) is really helpful.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Great purchase for my collection. Just building my 3D collection and this was a must have because of the CGI and action.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Visually stunning and great story lines, not to mention a great cast. A wonderful production and looking forward to more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very challenging and fun game to play and its free try it you have to just press that button.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle's story is really well told.  He's able to approach his absolutely incredible body of work without a hint of arrogance.  He approaches his story telling much like he approached his job - very professionally and very matter of fact.  He's not given to wild flourishes of language and despite the astronomical number of confirmed kills he's logged, he's very gracious throughout his story in terms of giving credit to the brave soldiers who he fought with.  I also thought the decision to include his wife's perspective throughout the story was a very interesting counter balance to Chris' perspective. It added an additional layer of humanity to an already human story.  I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in understanding what life is like behind the scope of a rifle in combat but I would also recommend this book to anyone who values and respects the sacrifices this nation's heroes make on a daily basis.  Although gone from this life, Chris' work in this book will ensure his legacy never dies.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved this book. If I were you I would read it. If you did not read this than get reading. Jackson swift
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Action packed and honest.  No Easy Day doesn't sugar coat the operation nor does it mythologize the SEALS who did it.  It's very straight forward and interesting.  Definitley recommended to anyone who's a fan of SEAL books.  Good stuff!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Started a little slow for me , but it was a good book.  Not entirely certain we needed to know all of the details , but on the other hand there are hopefully alot of details left out.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Recording Quality: Great, dynamic with good sound stage.<br /><br />This is the best Trower to date, if your a RT or Blues fan this is a must have.
B000SLP4SE|3.0|Shooter was entertaining enough, but it really seemed to me to drag on. I was ready for it to have ended about 30 minutes before it actually did.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book, I read it in one day, It is well worth the time and money!! Recommend to anyone. At first I wasn't sure it was a good choice but after I continued reading it, it got better. Loved it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who hasn't heard of this game?  It's a very entertaining game.  It's free on google play if you have an android phone.  It's basically a game where you use birds to knock down structures built by the pigs who stole their eggs. There are videos on youtube that help you get 3 stars on each level.
B00B8PMWJI|1.0|This should have been called 'The Worst of Humanity: An Art Film\\".<br />I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it even ventures into, and far past, Cinema Snob 70's-style territory.<br /><br />A lot of these didn't even make sense, like G for Gravity... what?!<br />Had child rape, more masturbation than RedTube and YouPorn combine, and yellow Japanese farts.<br /><br />You read that right, yellow Japanese farts.<br />I want my $9.99 and 2 hours of my life back.<br /><br />W for Worst Movie Ever.
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|This is a real classic. The movie just by its self is worth it but the &#34;Extra's&#34; really add to the background and mystique of the film.
B000002KBT|5.0|because the original of this is veeeery expensive. album looks and sounds fantastic. anyone who enjoys it and likes vinyl should own this.
B009K0P10K|5.0|We love Revenge and can't wait for the next episode to air. Watched season 1 on netflix and caught up to present with Amazon.
0321885112|5.0|Very good book, really creative and inspirational. Excellent for starting sketchnoting. The artwork is original and beautifull. Tons of ideas and tips for starters.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Pretty layout... easy to read warnings and watches... easy to flip between current, hourly, 36 hour, and 10 day. Maps are much slower then my desktop ap.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|For an exceptionally funny actress, the book had very few parts that made me laugh. I expected more from this book.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Very nice that I can watch the series from start to finish on Amazon.  This was not available on Netflix.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book has alot of great information.  I am not sure that I am ready to give up wheat though, when I get the grain organic and grind it myself.  For those who do not do this might be a good idea to give up wheat.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|If you love Angry Birds this is a fun one to have.  I love playing this at the appropriate holiday.  There hasnt been an update lately though and I wish I would have recieved a new Valentines and March update.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book and I couldn't put the book down. I love this book and I specially the characters.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|how did come back from death?<br /><br />the movie is all action from start to end, no story, nothing,  the bad guys seems to show up out of no where , it like some one's  dreams<br /><br />the worst 007 movie ever, a lot of stupidity in it, 007 looks like an untrained agent, he should put M in a place that the bad<br />guy can not find her, and he should have added about 15 agents with him and heavy weapons,
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love this book. Tina Fey is hilarious. This book had me laughing out loud on multiple counts. I would highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just passed my tablet down to my daughter and, of course, had to install Minecraft! It works well on my Samsung tablet and she is estatic!!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Ths is a must see mini-series and the best performance ever given by Gus and Call. All members of the cast are exceellent.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I liked the movie but it was not the best James Bond Movie of all considering it was the 50th year anniversary,
B009CF7GRY|1.0|Not to our liking.  We like dancing type movies, but this was crude.  We watch just a few minutes of it.
B00723NWJE|3.0|The songs in this album seem way too adolescent.  I think Norah's interpretations of established classics (her covers) are far more interesting than these.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I remember watchinng these as a kid.  They are classic and at the time had some ground breaking characters and issues.  That being said, i love how they are sort of cheesey as well.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This season was, beyond a doubt, one of the most emotional seasons of Downton yet. I am sad to see it end for another year, and rewatching many times as I begin the long wait until Season 4. The picture quality on this set is fantastic! I have come to expect no less from the blu ray sets released by PBS and Carnivale. If you are a fan, this is a no-brainer. If you are new to the show, best to start at Season 1 and work your way up to this point. It's some of the best television I have ever seen.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game so very much, even more so as Rome version!...Only thing is when I beat my friend it started showing her profile as mine which I can't figure out how to fix...any ideas?
B00BHMF578|4.0|I viewed this the night before the Oscars 2013 and I really enjoyed the movie in many respects.  I thought depiction of the story was very well done.  It brought back a lot of memories of those times for me, as I had just joined the Navy and this was a very tense time.  I thought the character development could have been deeper, but overall this was a fine movie indeed.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|u have to love amazon they take care of u they make sure your stuff is good and amazon cloud i storage my photo
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. Very engrossing. Terrific plot and interesting characters. The following Shift series made the original that much better. Cannot wait for &#34;Dust&#34;.
1616550414|5.0|The 65 pages of in depth descriptions of the Zelda timeline is plenty of reason to buy this. Any person who calls themselves a Zelda fan must buy this book.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|In an effort to simplify and help reorganize, REWORK was suggested by a friend....and it totally hit the mark!!<br />If you want to craft your organization to help produce a better working strategy and cut out the fluff so people are happier and more productive, this is a must-read!!
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed May's account of life on a Hebridean island, especially the vivid descriptions of the landscape and the weather. His changing point of view using the first person to develop Fin's character as a boy and the third person to tell the story of the crime and its resolution enabled me to understand Fin to greater extent than if the whole book had been written from a single point of view. I HOPE THAT AMAZON WILL MAKE THE OTHER TWO NOVELS OF THIS TRILOGY AVAILABLE SOON!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The updated sets and London production are incredible, but it is the aftershow with ALW and the original cast that makes this dvd so worth having.  You will not be disappointed at all, and you will watch the salute to ALW over and over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never could put t<br />he book down. Best book I've ever read. Now I get to watch the movie. (Mom wouldn't let me watch it until I read the book.) :D
B004J88SGC|5.0|My dad is a huge fan of Billy Joel - HUGE fan and this was the perfect birthday present for him.  He has watched this several times since I gave it to him a few weeks ago.  I have not seen him so happy with a gift in a long time.  Thanks for putting this out!
B00BHU261S|3.0|Not great but it was OK. It was good if you were a Psycho fan and wanted to learn about that movie.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig once again knocks it out of the park! You will not be disappointed by this movie. A must see!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a wonderful story. I can't wait to read the other books! I loved this story.. a love story in disguise.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and watched again via Amazon Digital Download the day before the Oscars.  I loved it both times!  The movie is riveting from start to finish.  I don't think anyone in the entire movie theater got up during the film. You will not be disappointed.  A great story.
0062215507|5.0|It came in perfect condition and in less time that I expected. It is the perfect gift for someone whoo loves Harry Potter, it come with a lot of props from the movies and some great content.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is not a horror story, instead an interesting look at time travel.  King's description of the late 50's early 60's, its problems and history and his take on them is fascinating.  His ability to create a plot that keeps you reading and characters that are likable and human keeps everything moving at a breakneck speed right up to the suprising end.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  It was well written telling the story from both sides.  It says that even in war there can be basic humanity.  I almost wish I could meet the principal characters.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Lived through it and remember the story... and still on the edge of my seat.  You know it's a good movie when the story and the some lines stick with you.
B00BEBJEY2|4.0|This album is definitely more atmospheric than most other Mogwai albums I've heard.  It still has an intensity, but not as much of the contrasting dynamics that they usually bring.  This one never really rocks out.  It meanders a bit, but that seems reasonable given the source material (which I've never seen).  Overall, it's enjoyable and I'm happy with the purchase.
B000FC10MU|3.0|Disclaimer: I am a creature of habit and was looking for something very specific from this book. I did not find it. That being said, I CAN say that Neil Gaiman's &#34;American Gods&#34; was a very well written book. However, when you are expecting something like one of the stories from &#34;Disc World&#34; and instead get a very introspective, slow, detailed book about an ex-con, you feel duped. I read a few reviews before I decided to download this book and they said things like &#34;This book is a poignant commentary on American indulgence,&#34; or &#34;Neil Gaiman has knocked another one out of the park,&#34; or &#34;This book is hilarious!&#34; I accept the fact that I might just not be well read, or I don't have an appropriate appreciation for this genre; but if you are looking for something that is easy, funny, sharp, and exciting, this book is not it. If you want mystery, introspection, subtle unfolding of plot, and excellent writing style, this is your book! Hope I helped.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I really like Connelly's style because there are twists and turns and things that you don't expect. I like that the 'Lincoln Lawyer' figures out the truth and justice does prevail.<br /><br />Held my attention the whole way.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After hearing from friends and family and total strangers how Downton Abbey was so wonderful, I decided to check it out. I am not sure if I am regretting the decision or thankful for their recommendations because now I am so addicted that I stayed up until 2:00 AM watching episodes the other night and then today found myself trying to watch from my computer during my lunch break today!  I love it!  Caught up on seasons 1 & 2, ready for 3 now.  I can't wait!!!!
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Again, held my attention and I like the court process between the prosecution and defense. Things are stacked up in favor for the prosecution but still it was a fight. I enjoyed this book a lot.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|You can't go wrong with a classic Bond movie!  This is a very entertaining action packed movie!  Don't miss it!
B0095P3ULC|5.0|This movie is one of my son favorite and he is always watching this movie.  He likes all the action and the characters and the story.
0634022296|3.0|If you want to play the song, this really is not a help.  If you want to strum it for fun, friends, or a sing-a-long, it should do.  I mean sometimes a chord won't change for two lines of the song and you are siting there strumming that one chord.  That is not fun.  Their songs have a lot of hooks and special sounds that make you remember it.  Often those are the parts not in this book of chords.  It is exactly what it is supposed to be (hence the 3 stars), but that is so unsatisfying that I can't recommend the book.
B004S9AK3G|4.0|I picked this book because I loved Pillars Of The Earth.  Whilst this is not a continuation of that story and stands alone in its own right, as a reader of Pillars I would have liked to see a few more references to the previous story and characters in Pillars. That is just a personal opinion.<br /><br />I was drawn in and enjoyed the characters and their journeys, but unlike some books I have read I wasn't able to totally lose myself in the story.<br /><br /> There were parts of the tale that seemed to drag a little (I'm doing my best to avoid spoilers in this review), and other parts seemed to race along at high speed and miss out detail that might have helped set the scene for this period in history.<br /><br />It was a good read that could have been even better than it was.  Buy it if you like historical fiction, and you will not be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started reading and couldn't stop.  Finished this book in One day!  Recommend read. Hope you enjoy it as much I did.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I lost two settlers lives. Oops!<br />Make sure you have plenty medicine for those sick people, or it might happen to you.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|This app is a work in progress. It works just fine on one of the settings but the other does not work on my phone. They know about the issue and are working to resolve it.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I love this story from other media however I'm finding the orignal is quite hard to read.  If you love the story its interesting to know the orignal verse
B00138KKP8|4.0|Have listened to and enjoyed all Ray LaMontagne's music and this CD is the best compilation--have it<br />on both CD for my car and on Amazon Cloud for my house!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It arrived two days after I ordered it in perfect condition. The price for this is amazing considering in the store its still $40 or more. Love the show this season just keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Already finished it and now sadly have to wait for the 3rd season but it is well worth the wait!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|They took a horror movie and made it just amazing.  This isn't really a horror movie, so if you are looking to be scared, this isn't the movie to watch.  But if you want an amazing movie, watch this!  So much is great about this movie I can't even describe it!  All I can say is if you watch this, you will not be disappointed!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Wonderful series throughout.  Blu ray quality is fantastic.  I Would highly recommend having the whole series at home to rewatch.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|The marzipan is very tasty, just like I remember it from England.<br /><br />And, our grandson is having a great time, lots of imagination play with the Kapla blocks
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Fun movie about chasing birds. You learn some cool facts about birds and there is a good story line. I Loved it.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|Have never owned a Beth Orton CD before but had heard odd tracks  over the years. Decided to buy this and all I can say is this is a wonderful album. The voice is superb and varied, and the backing band and vocals are a sheer delight. A must have.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|perfect use for what I needed.  I was skeptical at first, but nope, worked better than anticipated<br /><br />three more words.
B000001FDP|4.0|Enjoyed this at the first listen and know it will get better with each play. Bit disappointed as amazon has it listed as a 2012 release in their item description when its an old recording. Sound is still excellent but did think it was a new Vangelis album. My fault I guess for not reading the fine print. Lovely album none the less.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A totally enjoyable romp through Yemen with John Corey, and Kate Mayfield, that was filled with that pattented John Corey sarcastic wit , and humor. a wonderful read!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|. Good clean entertainment.<br />. No dislikes about product or story line..<br />. Gift for Wife would recommend for anyone.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I enjoyed it, but in the end I was left puzzled by it getting the Oscar for \\"Best Picture\\". It is certainly not going to be a memorable picture for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game helps me get things off my mind when I'm upset or not in a positivemood I love subway suffers
B000FCKIFU|3.0|Although this book is dated it is still an enjoyable read. The camel club is made up of a bunch of misfits who watched out for the American people and democracy.
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! The extras are awesome. If you like bluegrass, you will like this CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game by far that I have downloaded and its free I love love love it!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|i love this game but it glitches and i just get hit with a train and it had a ad for he new update so i clicked on it and it deleted all of my data like highscore coins characters gone but over all it a fun game and i liked it
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|No surprises and great quality as expected. Arrived on time and case was not broken. Great price compared to going to the store unless you found some great sale.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book, easy read, another book you dont want to put down. The book is better than the movie!
B004AFFZNI|4.0|Audio comes out way better with this and have easy access to audio in plug (main reason for buying it). The locking mechanism on the top does not smoothly lock without without feeling like it might brake one of the plastic hooks. Closes very securely, just feels like it might brake one day compared to my water tight case.
184195392X|5.0|I bought this book when I heard that a movie was coming out.  I was not prepared for how enchanting and beautiful this story truly is.  It is funny, sad, touching and profound.  The movie only enchanced the beauty of this tale.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Great family movie, except for first 10 mins or so, when the grandmother died.  I really enjoyed the racing scenes.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Was even better then the first one, you fell in love with the main characters.I can`t wait for the last book!!!!!
B004XZR63M|2.0|What I wanted this book to be:<br />My hopes of reading this book were to get insight on how the psyche of rich people think and operate verses that of the poor.<br /><br />What the book actually is:<br />In this book, I felt the author bragged more about his success than he did trying to explain the differences. I felt his view on the subject was very narrow (there's a big emphasis on real estate).  He also was very redundant as he boasted about his success.  After reading this book, I didn't feel confident that he was an expert in dealing with money, but more lucky.  He seemed to be in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />In addition, the book wasn't written well.<br /><br />My advice is to rent this book at the library if you're curious. It's not worth it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the music the Guys put out, but I love the videos that they do with the music and put on youtube just as much. Somehow, we need both together. What a great group, and they always appear to be enjoying what they do too.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is like Bioshock meets Myst and is super addicting.  I didn't expect it to hold my attention long, was just looking for something to pass the time, then I found myself playing until 3 in the morning...I just couldn't put it down!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks story but a little different twist to it.  He is able to keep your attention throughout the book.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|could not get this ap to work.  Think it is not updated for my new epson printer. Hope the developers will update it soon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game ever. Plus it is so so adicting. I freaking &lt;3 this game. I think ever one would love this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The title is a statement on it own.  The book has the same pace of the previous two without being trite.  Clearly a statement  about life; that of a mockingjay
B009E3EY38|4.0|Great.Make sure you buy Deluxe 2 CD AND 2 DVD.I was hoping for a couple of my favorites including Moby Dick and All of my love.I ENOYED LISTENING AND WATCHING.The bonus DVD is rehersal which I enjoyed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooooooo fun I think that it's a lot better and more fun than temple run but.it's tied with temple run 2
B0064NTZKI|5.0|I´m from Argentina and since it´s far from US, I´ve always received all my items on time and in perfect conditions. I have no complains at all. Great and quick service.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abby is perfect while I am on the elliptical. Entrrtaing and touching. Time flies by and I've learned something about history.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|crisp, clean, classic, and challenging.  like all brainium games nice stat keeping abilities.  can pass hours away with this game.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|A lot of people sleep on Bruno Mars but he's a pretty good artist. I liked his first album and this one is just as good.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  It gives you a better understanding of what when on in Iran and makes you appreciate what we have here in America, that we sometimes take for granted.  It also gives you a better understanding for the reason our military want to stay in those foreign countries until the job is done.
B0036UW09U|2.0|I gave this film a low rating because the sound quality was very poor. After-all, it was about two music superstars.<br />Some of the songs were audible enough, but the dialogue between the actors was terrible.  It made for a very frustrating<br />two hours!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|We love and have all the James Bond movies.  This one was a little hard to get into at the beginning, because it didn't start out as your typical Bond movie starts.  Must realize that with something starting the same way 22 times before it was different.  However, as the movie progressed it got better and better.  The ending was sad but good on the other hand, knowing that &#34;James Bond will be back&#34;.  We would recommend this movie, in fact our daughter recommended the movie to us.
B00BECZPI0|2.0|Wow, after a promising build up from Season 2, Season 3 just fails to really go anywhere. The show is just so disjointed and the characters change personality on the flip of the dime, one has to wonder if they just fire the writing staff on a weekly basis.<br /><br />Instead of going into a long rant that I don't feel like writing, I'll just point out the flaws as I see them.<br /><br />1. Racism -- Yes, this show is pretty racist. It doesn't seem that there are any black people on the writing staff nor do any of them have any interaction with black people. Every black character that becomes part of the group essentially accepts Rick as the \\"Great White Hope.\\" Even Tyrese who didn't join the group looked at him in awe, accepting Rick's decision to throw them out as \\"right\\" instead of saying \\"this guy is crazy.\\"<br /><br />We also have a problem with the \\"one black guy rule.\\" For some reason, the show is not allowed to have more than one black male character at a time. And whenever one dies, he's essentially replaced by a clone who takes a subservient role to Rick.<br /><br />2. The Governor -- Apparently they had trouble trying to give the Governor a reason to a bad guy. Thinking back, I'm not even sure they found a coherent one. You're sort of left wondering \\"why is this guy being such a douche.\\"<br /><br />3. Michonne -- If she actually carried a sword on her back, she would not be able to pull it out of its scabbard that easily, if at all (unless you have a very, very long arm that dragged on the ground). Thus, this is why you see the scene cut before she actually draws her sword. Michonne doesn't do much except glare and follow Rick around like a puppy dog, unless it's an episode where her personality changes and then she's just glaring at Rick too.<br /><br />4. The battle at the prison was anti-climatic. No spoilers, but you will feel like \\"that's the climax of the season?\\"<br /><br />5. Merle -- The utter lack of realistic logic when it comes to the use of this character is will leave you wondering if the writing for the show has made you dumber.<br /><br />6. Andrea -- All the development from season 2 is thrown out the window as she goes from having a lot of potential to lacking any sense or intelligence at all.<br /><br />7. The story -- Considering that this was the prison, there was potential for several story arcs with the prisoners and adjusting to life in the prison. Instead, the taking of the prison and the drama that could follow is sort of hurried through while Woodbury seems to drag on forever. Most of the season feels like filler, with most episodes ending where the story began that week ... that means, it doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />*Spoilers* 8. Deaths -- Let's face it, the people who died this season were either so undeveloped that they were easily replaced (T-Dogg), written to be totally unlikeable (Andrea, Lori) or we didn't know why we were supposed to care (Merle). I understand it's \\"survival horror\\" but that doesn't excuse crappy writing.<br /><br />9. Laughably bad acting -- Mostly from David Morrissey who sounds more like an Elvis impersonator than a tough southerner. The actress that plays Andrea unfortunately seems confused as to how to play her part, probably due to the inconsistent writing of her character. The rest just seem to wander around with vacant looks most of the time, not really sure how they're supposed to express themselves. Bad all around.<br /><br />10. I could go on -- Give me a chance to force myself to rewatch an episode and I'm sure I could make a bigger list.<br /><br />There is a positive though:<br /><br />1. The sets are nice -- It's obvious that a lot of work was put into Woodbury and the Prison. Too bad that effort wasn't put into the writing or acting.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|A true twist to the concept of zombies. completely enjoyed it. Easy to read and compeling. Hard to put down. What got me was the sadness and regret that threads through the story, just as with the worse times in human history
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I loved the first three books from George RR Martin, and this season certainly lived up to A Clash of Kings for me.  In fact, with the editing it may have been even better.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Typical Jack Reacher.  Lots of excitement, twists and reasoning.  Definitely  something to read. You can see it all happening in your mind.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|Aside from the fact that the British think they are the only ones who will be left on the earth. Where England and Australia are only inhabitable countries left in the world. Its a good movie, story follows the original to some degree though the story takes place on Earth and not Mars. Good Special Effects.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun addicting game. Lots of little missions to keep you busy/entertained. Just with there was a way to get free coffee to boost the energy level.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is super addicting.  So much fun.  Hard to quit playing.  Can't wait to see what happens when I get all the pieces.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Game was ok but needed more. There were missions but it just seemed like it was the same thing over and over again. It got boring quick. I ended up deleting it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very intriguing. I will definitely read works from this author again. It was an inspiring story, especially coming from personal experience.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Another game that didn't work on my Kindle. Not sure why. I downloaded it but it would just keep loading over and over again when I tried to play. Ended up deleting it.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Wonderful  continuation of Pollyanna's life.  I could hardly put it down.  Keeping to the original theme of the first book and many of its characters this book adds answers to questions one may have wondered about in the first book.  Pure in it's content. Refreshing.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|I didn't care for this game. It was boring and difficult to play. Character didn't seem to move when he was supposed to.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Not only was the cinematography excellent but I loved the story line.  I did read the book before watching and with any book to movie some things were added but it only made the movie better.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Can never go wrong with the classic Spider card game. It's a fun (and free) way to kill the time
B002SAUCBC|5.0|One of the best I have read in a long time. Unexpected ending. Worth your time. Read it after seeing some bad reviews and now that I finished, I totally disagree with them. Hooked me in after only a few pages and could not put it down.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I didn't care for this game. Was a little hard to get the character to jump/duck when directed to. Ended up deleting it.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|True to form, a good Bond film from Daniel Craig who, as it turns out, is my favorite Bond to date and I've enjoyed them all.<br />A sure thing if there is such!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for the family and my nephew.[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]<br />It's free and very entertaining
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I have seen this movies a few times and every time I watch it I am struck by the easy way a soul falls over an emotional cliff to cut ties with a past.  So many of us yearn to cut those ties but clamor onto the end and look with regret at what we may have done with our change in life's choices.  This shows a choice that naively walks to a discordant end.  It shows the language of an inner siren's call, and the tragic death of a soul dashed against the rocky tumultuous shores of a tormented life.  And...makes it seem sweet....horrifyingly sweet!
1932735410|5.0|I am using this book to prepare my PMP exam, in addition to PMBOK guide. In my opinion this book is a &#34;Must to have&#34;, because it is an invaluable tool if you are studying for the PMP certification.  It is very clear, easy to understand, provides a lot of examples, exercises and guidelines, point the key topics and it shows you the way.<br /><br />So, I think it was a right decision to have bought it.
0375703861|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed White Teeth...it provided a rare glimpse into a side of London that is invisible to most people...I look forward to reading NW next...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it addictive a very challenging game.one of the best free games I have played. Have recommended to family and friends
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought this would be like most stories out there. You know bad boy meets good girl...and so forth. I was surprised at the storyline and some of the twists thrown in. The male lead was actually not trying to be this rough controlling guy, he was actually there for the female lead through a lot of horrible things. Every way he acted odd the author did a neat job wrapping it by answering every question and detail so u were not left wondering about his reactions to certain events. This book is something that should not be passed up.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Game does not load properly.  When I contacted Amazon help, they suggested I uninstall the game and then re-install it.  In doing so, I lost all the puzzles I had purchased and the game continued to not load properly.<br /><br />I phoned customer service and they advised me that the company had been notified and an update to the game was forthcoming.  I was also refunded for all the purchases I had made.  Am very satisfied with the service I received.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|&#34;Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others... past and present... and by each crime and every kindness, we both have a future.&#34;  I saw this movie in the theater because from the trailer it looked like a mish-mash of all of my favorite genres. I really didn't understand the point. It didn't click. But I decided to read the novel to see it there was something I missed. Let me tell you, seeing it again after reading the book was an epiphany in itself. This time, I had fun trying to pick out all the actors in the different stories, but they're hidden so well I still missed a few! And the editing so very profound. The book is so straight-forward, but the way the stories are entwined and paralleled in the film is nothing short of genius. I was more in awe than I was the first time I watched it! Extremely impressive film, but I suggest doing some research or reading the novel beforehand, so you can appreciate what they did here. Also worth many re-watchings to catch things you may have missed before!
B00006J9OT|4.0|As a casual fan of Diana Krall since 1995, I have always fancied her sultry voice because of the unique sound it lends to her music. I first discovered Ms. Krall when I happened to hear (and subsequently purchase) her second studio album, Only Trust Your Heart. Many years later, I purchased her fifth studio album, When I Look In Your Eyes. Both of those albums have always enjoyed a varied rotation in my CD collection but many of her other albums have fallen flat with me for whatever personal reason.<br /><br />However, after hearing some cuts from her Live In Paris album several years ago, I immediately knew that I wanted to add this particular album to my collection. Since purchasing it, this CD has quickly become one of the favorites in my entire collection! While several of the tracks on this Live In Paris album also appear on my other two studio albums, I find the live versions to be completely compelling and it's an utter pleasure to listen to the entire album from start to finish whether it be at work or a party, while relaxing at home, or simply driving the car. Kudos to the recorders and sound engineers on this album who make it appear so intimate and downright flawless, especially considering that it's a live album.<br /><br />While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it is completely unfathomable to me how a small number of the other reviewers could give this album just a one-star or two-star rating. Many reviewers state that Ms. Krall cannot sing and cannot be compared to other female jazz greats. There's no doubt that musicians like Ella Fitzgerald are in a league of their own but that's not to say that Ms. Krall is not equally talented in her own right, as evidenced by her legion of her fans like myself who find that unique sound of hers to be music to our ears. I'm giving this album four stars because, simply put, I love it and bet you will too!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil franchise and Ms. Jovovich.  This one reached a little to far and delivered way too little.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|I didn't expect too much from this movie so I wasn't disappointed.  Obviously they got Jennifer Lawrence before she became a mega star.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I really see no reason for a long drawn out review.  Do people read four page reviews?  Great acting (lipstick on a pig) in a horrible, boring and silly movie.  I read a review in the New York Times that stated this was an \\"actor's film\\".  I laughed my ass off.  It is an actor's film because the only people that gave a poo about it were the actors in it.  Save yourself some time and take a trip on mushrooms or something.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|Kinda disappointing.  Meryl Streep & Tommy Lee Jones are both good but the story was just okay.  Steve Carrell in a completely straight role was surprising.  Thought it would be funny but no.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing stories, acting and writing.  I love that no one is safe.  It keeps you on edge at all time because a character you like may get eaten at anytime.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Downloaded this movie to take on vacation.  Actually watched it on our flight....ha ha.  The story turns out to be different than you might expect.  Really about addiction and redemption.  Excellent portrayal by Denzel.
B0030B624E|3.0|Great casts lead to great expectations.  This movie was amusing but I think it could have been so much better.  The whole segment in LA was silly and a terrible way to wrap up what was up to that point a pretty good movie.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love seeing my Win 8 desktop on my Nexus 7 tablet. it is the very best of both worlds!
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I really wanted to love this movie.  The three main actors are so amazing but the story sucks and you can't cover up the stench of a rotten screenplay. Sad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thus was fantastic!  It has you rooting for katniss  an  peers the whole time. Even better than the first book!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I remember the disappointment of watching Stallone destroy Dredd.  Thank God, Urban is the perfect Dredd.  The story, acting and special effects are far superior to the now forgotten Sly version.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A must read for science fiction fans!  Can't wait for the sequel(s)!  Best indie books I've read.  Well done, Mr. Howey!!
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|This was such a breath of fresh air.  I am so tired of these sappy, whiny little b**ch vampires.  These guys are mean and disgusting.  The film does not have a huge budget but delivers way more than was invested. Love vamps then you will love this movie.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Tommy Lee is always good but this was just a typical cop movie with John Candy playing the typical Louisiana bad guy.  The plot seems to have already been done so I really would not recommend this one.
B009GENZKS|4.0|Awesome animation and very scary too! If you are a Resident Evil fan you will enjoy this as much as the movies.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was so entertained by this book, I can't tell you. Writing a story largely from the viewpoint of a personal journal can be tiresome - but the main character just carries it. The tone is perfect and you quickly begin to identify with a believably real character behind the words, not a fictional one.<br /><br />And, it is funny. Over IQ'd scientists engaging in a constant repartee and bitchin' competition is just so true. I do hope this guy keeps writing. Botanists everywhere will bless him for making them seem cool.

0375842209|5.0|I read this book in my sophomore year of high school. I wasn't and still am not a big fan of reading but there are some exceptions and this is one of them. I absolutely loved this book! This book is about a girl named Leisel living in Nazi Germany. She steals books and has a love for reading during a time when books were being burned. The story is narrated by death and he tells Leisel's story. I loved how it was narrated by death. It was very unique and a combination of first person and third person omnicient at the same time. He knew things that happened and what was going to happen and spoke directly to the reader. I also loved the historical aspect of it. If you are interested in world war II history like me then this would be a good book for you. Also this book really made me love the characters and it had me very emotional at the end. I cared about what happened to them. Overall this is a wonderful book that I think any teen or adult should read.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I had 7 characters but 3/4 when I got on I had no mouny and non of my characters I just had Jake! :(
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Very good. I bit all my nails off reading this! It is definitely a good book! I can't wait for the next one!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great film; ignore the critics!  It's a great two hour ride into the past about the 'opening shots' of the global war on terrorism.  Also, read Mark Bowden's book Guests of the Ayatollah.  Congrats to Ben Affleck on the Oscar for best picture.  Very much deserved.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great game . Good graphics, nice backgrounds and beautiful colors. The sounds and music add to the whole experience.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This a great Movie, well directed, and full of historic facts about what really happened.<br /><br />Recommended! I will watch it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|That's how long it took me to make it through the series, and I'm only pausing before buying the next one because the Q&A at the end asked me to. Howey's story, the publishing of these books and how they caught fire, is what reading should be in the digital age. Looking forward to the next series.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|so moving and you pulled right into the story. just loved reading this book.  the emotional connection between the two main characters jumped off the page. the reader could feel their pull even as she couldn't at first
B00BHMF578|4.0|Self aggrandizing celebrities on parade.  Otherwise, good film.  Acting was average.  Story sold the show.  A definite must watch for anyone interested in History/Middle East/Intelligence discussions.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This series is well written and  vastly entertaining.  I loved Clary and Jace and all the other cast members like they were family.  Many exciting plot twists, lessons to be learned, I couldn't get my own work accomplished because of voraciously reading every book available, then signing up for the new one coming soon.  Much better, in my view, than the books presently in the limelight about vampires and werewolves.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awsome because you can get a new person after a few games.If you find a box with a question mark on it get it if you can then when you die in the game after that you get to open the box!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved it this game was a great buy!!!!!! I highly recommend  it. I can't wait for the sequel. A must buy.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I picked this up because I'd heard some guys at work discussing it and it sounded interesting.  So after I read the free &#34;mini-story&#34; that is the introduction to the &#34;WOOL&#34; world, I was hooked and immediately bought the Wool Omnibus.  Well played, Hugh Howey . . . well played indeed.  The omnibus started a little slowly setting everything up, but it then moves at a breakneck pace and is so fun to read!
B0064Y5U24|5.0|Can't beat the price and as we have all become accustomed to...Nickelback rocks!!! I love getting my music from Amazon and now that I have a Kindle I get all of my books from Amazon as well!!!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I only wish &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing&#34; and &#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34; were on here.<br /><br />It's brilliant nonetheless.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|We saw this movie twice in theaters and watch it almost every weekend.  It's a great movie for children and adults!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Me Before You by JoJo Moyes is a gut-wrenching, heartbreaking and incredibly lovely novel about a man with everything -- looks, money, great job, class, the girl -- who loses nearly everything when he is rendered a quadriplegic after a motorbike accident. It's also a story about his unlikely caregiver, a young lady with little ambition and a lot of heart, and how they evolve in six short months.<br /><br />This book will stay with you long, long after you've read the final sentence. It will make you cry. It will force you to reflect on compassion and truth and love. And it will make you want to savor every moment to your last breath.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|being a prime member, and being able to watch it for free is not a bad deal. This Transformer movie is a good one, but the first one is still the best.
0767817664|3.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this vampire movie...<br /><br />Fright Night (1985) is a cheesy vampire movie that blends horror and humor and is straight from the heart of the 1980s.  The best performance is by Roddy McDowall, who plays a vampire hunter.  Personally, I don't really care for vampire movies that are campy.  I like my vampire movies scary and more serious, such as my all-time favorite vampire movie, Salem's Lot (1979).  Or, a lot of the Dracula movies over the years.  Some of the Hammer vampire and Dracula movies have moments of borderline cheesiness, however, it's all made up for with serious horror, scary vampires, and lots of blood.<br /><br />Fright Night does not make my list of \\"My Top 13 Vampire Movies\\".  I would rank Fright Night probably 20-something at best.  It's a decent movie, but not one I would want to watch multiple times.  I must say, though, that it's FAR better than those horrible Twilight movies.  I would rank those Twilight movies around 224th on my list of favorite vampire movies.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I decided to get this album because of the price. There are a few songs on this album that I really like a lot.
B0095P29EG|5.0|I love marvel comics. Always have. This is a great addition to the Avengers collection. The effects are outstanding, especially scenes from Asgard. Highly recommend it.
B003B02OOG|3.0|did not live up to what i expect from grisham.  not to good.  the story kind of dragged and did not hold my attendsion
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|This is the only digital movie I've ever owned. I look forward every Christmas to seeing it on tv, and now I no longer have to wait. This is one of the best family movies out there.
0142421375|3.0|it was a tab better than the rest of his current books, but not great compared to his other books
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Decent game. Nice that two can play live or you can just play the CPU. However, on the more difficult levels when playing the CPU, it's interesting how many doubles it gets compaired to how many you get.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love this movie nad the BD sent was in great condition, it actually was new with a bonus disk that I really didn't need.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book narrates (in a very simple and entertaining way) all the events, circumstances, and historical and cultural facts  that helped individuals become extremely successful rather than the conventional explanations based only on the individual's personality traits (educational background, routine, dietary regimen, favorite music,  etc). It personally helped me understand and explain many of people's reactions and behavioral patterns within my work and social circles based on their backgrounds - it was a fun exercise!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Great Acting, Great Action! This could be my favorite sports movie ever! I love the Rocky movies but this one is right up there as well. Im more of a boxing fan than MMA but this MMA movie rocked!
B00992CF6W|5.0|me and my brother have this game and we love so much that we cant take our eyes off of it. I got this on my kindle fire and he got this game on the ipad and ipod touch goth generation.
B0095P31L6|4.0|A good movie to watch. Kids would enjoy watching it too. too. A whole family kind of show and no sleeping.
B005JABSB6|4.0|Do not waste your money on generic 3d glasses.  Get the ones that are specified for your TV.  There are several models of Sharp 3d TVs get the glasses specific to your TV.  Some glasses will work with different models by the brand. I ended up spending more by trying to save money on the generic.  The generic say they work with (specific) brand names, they do to an extent.  They do not show all the detail that the very weak 3d.  Many of the 3d segments are totally missing.  I thought that 3d should be so much better than what we were watching with the generic 3d.  Save you money by buying glasses that say they will fit your TV and they are 3d. Yes thy are but only pick up a smaill portion of the 3d and then not good.  Bite the bullet and just get the 3d glasses specific to your TV.  You will not regret it.  The glasses are 5 star +.<br />I gave this a 4 because I feel that the glasses should come with the TV or at the very least a huge discount.<br /><br />PS:  Warning there are movies out there that claim to be 3d but use old technology (Blue/Red lens cardboard glasses).<br />Be sure to purchase recent 3-D moves that are made for today's technology, you will not get the effects you are looking for.<br />I bought a few older 3-d movies they were not updated to today's standards.  Very disappointed in those movies.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Case is great and love the color too. Only can't seem to make it stand up or male it stay there.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|What can I say, the storyline is not as good as it could be, but the special effects are fantastic.  Very enjoyable movie.  The special effects come right out into your room. I felt I was in the picture at times.  Beautiful effects. Glad I bought it.  The best 3D I have seen.  I will watch over and over again.  I just love the effects in this movie.<br /><br />PS:  You must have a 3D bluRay DVD or you will not get the special effects. You would be suprised how many people do not think of this.  Your DVD BluRay player should be the same manufacturer and compatable with your TV's specific Model. Be sure that you have the correct manufacturer's glasses for your model TV. (Not generic that say you can use it with XYZ TV for 3D)  There are different glasses for different models of TV's from the same manufacturer.  If you have samsung, Everything should be Samsung, TV, DVR & Glasses for that specific model of 3D TV.  Do not let a salesperson who wants to make a sale, tell you different.  They will do anything to make a sale.  Read the DVD box carefully make sure it is compatable with your TV, same with the 3D glasses.  Read, do your homework.  Everything must be the same brand and compatible to the TV model. I could not get great 3D.  I was using the generic glasses that work with XYZ TV.  Good picture but just enhanced HD.  I got the matching 3D DVR for my TV. Much better, but not worth all the hype.  I got the glasses that match with my TV and magic happened.  I am convinced that you must have everything that matches your System to get the best picture.  PS, I also got a bose system for sound, the speakers in the flat screen TV's are not great.  Just like the movie theater and I can sit around in my jammies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an interesting book, but I felt the ending was lame.  The characters were overall pretty annoying which made it hard to get into at the beginning.  The second half was more rewarding with a good mystery feel.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|No jolts or surprises ...run of the mill Nicholas Sparks novel.  His characters are all the same - alpha male to the rescue to the damsel in distress.  YAWN
B00BHMEALA|2.0|over hyped, extreme bore. The actor were alright, John Goodman being best of all. For all the talk about it, you would have thought it was at least interesting.
0385535147|4.0|Okay, so John Grisham will never win the Pulitzer or Nobel Prizes.  I doubt if he cares (well, all writers care, I guess).  Reading John Grisham books is akin to finding a fine TV series, one you can count on, a &#34;Friday Night Lights&#34; or &#34;Homeland&#34; or &#34;The Good Wife.&#34;  Grisham entertains and informs and manages to still raise important moral and ethical issues.  He still writes the best of the legal thriller.
1451695195|4.0|Even the most cynical and skeptical of readers will easily get caught up in this book and find themselves thinking, \\"What if?\\" The author, a neurosurgeon, develops E.coli bacterial meningitis. In a coma for seven days with virtually no brain activity except those related to life support, the comatose doctor has an out-of-body experience that transforms the way he thinks, behaves, and relates to other people.<br /><br />Before his sickness, Dr. Alexander described himself as more scientific than religious. Although he and his colleagues had heard innumerable NDEs (Near Death Experience) from patients over the years, they were skeptical, almost dismissive of the accounts. But then, one night he went to the bed with a backache and was in a coma in ICU the next morning. For the next several days while his family and friends kept a round-the-clock vigil, Dr. Alexander was experiencing other realms and feeling love like he'd never known it.<br /><br />There's much to read and ponder in Proof of Heaven. Dr. Alexander states something that I've somehow always \\"known,\\" that the death of the body and the brain are not the end of consciousness and that human experience continues beyond the grave. He quotes Sir John C. Eccles when he mentions, \\"We have to recognize that we are spiritual beings with souls existing in a spiritual world as well as material beings with bodies and brains existing in a material world.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's training and experience as a surgeon are evident on nearly every page, and it's this scientific background that make his findings and writings that much more credible. Although much of the medical terminology was unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed learning more about the body and brain. Especially enlightening were the passages about consciousness (what it is, how it works, how there are so many things beyond human awareness).<br /><br />For anyone who's ever wondered about his or her place in the universe, this book is a must-read. As the author states, \\"Each and every one of us is deeply known and cared for by a Creator who cherishes us beyond any ability we have to comprehend.\\"ates, \\"Each and every one of us is deeply known and cared for by a Creator who cherishes us beyond any ability we have to comprehend.\\"
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Old Show looked great on my HD tv.  Remastering was the best thing that ever happened to the old series.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I have always wanted to watch this series, but not having a cable or satelite subscription I have been able to. All I can say after being able to with my Amazon Prime account is WOW! There is little about this show I don't like. The characters are strong as well as the plot. I highly recommend this for those who are fans of scifi shows!
B004OC07GM|5.0|excellent incite into how technology disrupts an industry and how management should respond, it would have been great if he could have included more examples in the book covering different industries
0446580848|1.0|I have read all of Nelson DeMilles books and thought they all were great, some more than others.This is the exception.I couldn't wait for this to come out after the Lion series.The book is 600 pages..550 pages are about yemen and why you shouldn't go there.Terrible waste..If you get the book, read the first 2 chapters and then skip to the last 50 pages and save yourself a lot of time.I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it.
0812982622|3.0|I found this to be an extremely challenging read. There is no doubt that it is a remarkable story and is very finely written, but I found it quite a chore to get through.<br />Set in North Korea, this is a very relevant and topical subject matter, I'm quite fascinated by the place and looked forward to reading this. I learnt a lot from this book, I was shocked and stunned and horrified at times, but still I did not really engage with the story. I could not lose myself in it.<br />I have no doubt that this book will win awards, and those will be well deserved. I feel a bit ridiculous saying that I'd like something 'lighter', given the seriousness of the subject matter.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|We gave this to my daughters best friend for her birthday. The girls were both very excited to watch it. They LOVE Monster High.. and I must say, a lot better than those Barbie movies.
B0088D3PYE|5.0|It is just before Christmas 1957 in Barcelona. Daniel Sempere and Bea are now married and have a small son Julian. The bookshop Sempere and Son is struggling along and their friend Fermin is preparing to marry Bernarda. It is the appearance of a stranger, out of the shadows, that thrusts these characters back into the murky depths of the past and back to the Cemetery of Lost Books.<br />The Prisoner of Heaven is Firmin's story. As he at last reveals the truth about his background to Daniel, the reader is transported to the prison cells of Mountjuic castle - the place where Franco's followers would incarcerate, torture and later 'dispose' of political enemies.<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafon's writing is atmospheric, descriptive and totally compelling. His words draw such solid pictures in the head of the reader that the sounds, sights and smells of underground Barcelona jump from the page. The dark gothic feel of the city is wonderfully drawn, and his characters are so realistic that they become friends of the reader by the end of the story.<br /><br />Although Ruiz Zafon assures readers that each of the books in this series can be read as stand-alone stories, I would recommend that they are read in the order that they are written. Personally, I think anyone new to the series would struggle to fully enjoy and follow The Prisoner of Heaven without having read at least one of the previous instalments, not least because it is so much shorter than the others.<br /><br />For me, The Prisoner of Heaven is yet another triumph from Ruiz Zafon, lively and full of dark humour and an almost perfect cast of characters. My one complaint is that it is too short, I wanted more than the 278 pages offered by the hardback edition and only hope that we don't have to wait for too long for the final book of the series.

0375869026|5.0|Wonder by R J Palacio really is an absolute wonder. Written for children aged 10 and over, and published by Bodley Head, with a release date of 1 March 2012. So, not long to wait. My recommendation is to either pre-order your copy now or ensure that you are outside the door of the bookshop as soon as it opens on the morning of 1 March.<br /><br />There are some stories and some characters that get under the skin, that feel like an itch that no matter hard you scratch, they just won't go away.<br />August, known as Auggie is one such character. Auggie is the 'wonder' in the title. A small boy who is different on the outside, but inside he's just a kid who likes Star Wars and grilled cheese sandwiches. Auggie's birth was difficult and his life so far has been more so. With a face that is disfigured, Auggie is used to people staring, whispering and looking away quickly when they spot him.<br />Auggie has been home-schooled, but it's time for him to go to middle school and Wonder is the story of his first year in school.<br />The first part of the story is narrated by Auggie - he's a down-to-earth kid, sweet-natured, bright, loving and loved by his family. He is also very different, he wears his hair long so that his face is partly covered, his favourite day is Halloween, because that's the one night that everyone wears a mask and nobody is judged by the way they look.<br />We also hear from Auggie's sister Via, and a couple of his friends. Each voice is unique, each voice tells Auggie's story from their perspective and each voice is brilliantly written.<br />Wonder is fabulous and I'm positive that it will have the same impact as Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nightime. It is a story of hope and survival and a story with the underlying message that it really is what is under the surface that counts. As it says on the back cover of my proof copy; &#34;Don't judge a boy by his face.&#34;<br /><br />I could go on and on and on, but I won't. Please, read this book. Encourage your children to read it, lend it to your friends, buy a copy as a present. As Auggie's teacher Mr Browne says; &#34;When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.&#34;<br /><br />It's safe to say that I was totally and utterly transfixed by Wonder. I read it during one day and had an almost constant lump in my throat throughout. R J Palacio has created one of the most moving and uplifting books that I have ever read. Auggie will stay with me for a long, long time.<br /><br />&#34;Everyone deserves a standing ovation because we all overcometh the world.&#34; - Auggie Pullman
0805080120|3.0|At times, reading this book, it almost put me to sleep, so to speak!  Hahahaha!!!<br />But there are parts in this book that explain things about the English Language which I have never read anywhere else.<br />Every Language seems to BORROW and change the spelling and/or the pronunciation of many words in its useage by us English speakers.  G. Deutscher has made me understand where many of our words came from and how, especially through the changing or evolving pronunciation of certain letters, in Germanic, words like &#34;HAVE&#34; which apparently derived from root or original words or meanings of Grasp or Sieze, which are often easier to understand the link in Latin  (from which we also borrowed many words) of a similar meaning, such as &#34;Catch&#34;, &#34;Capture&#34;, &#34;Occupy&#34;.<br />Deutscher spends a lot of words or chapters showing Language as Metaphor, which makes a great deal of sense, but I rarely thought about or focused on, until I studied my first &#34;foreign&#34; language.<br />But this book is probably only going to appeal to those who really, actually find WORDS, their meanings and origins, INTERESTING.  For what it is worth, I was terribly disinterested in and got poor grades in Elementary through High School, English and Grammar!  In fact, I really never understood English until I took a course in High School on FRENCH!<br />I didn't understand what conjugations of verbs, idioms, word genders and spelling and all of that until FRENCH!<br />Many words we obviously borrowed from French or Latin, or &#34;Romance&#34; languages make sence when you learn the vocabulary, words in a foreign language;  Our word: TRAVEL, comes from TRAVAILLE, whicn means &#34;WORK, TOIL&#34; in French.<br />In the days of getting around only by foot or horse or even carriage, let alone by car, train or Jet today, is WORK and quite often very Tiring!  And guess what the French word for FISH is?  It is the same as our English word for POISON, it's just pronouced differently!  And if you have ever eaten Bad Fish or Shell fish, you know you have eaten POISON and you got sick.ifferently!  And if you have ever eaten Bad Fish or Shell fish, you know you have eaten POISON and you got sick.
030771652X|3.0|I read this one whilst I was away in Corfu, finished it in one day. I agree that the writing is excellent, but it really didn't thrill me at all. I found it all just too bleak for words, it's a really clever concept and like most people I didn't work out the ending but there was just something missing for me.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This and the other movie video starring the same two leading actors makes a believable action drama.<br />Both Robert Downey Jr. and his co-star, bring their A-game actor personnas here.<br />The script writer and Direction and the frequent slow-motion pre-show of a scene or group of scenes are all BRILLIANT and really increased the entertainment value that makes this a REALLY GOOD SHOW in my humble opinion.<br />What is it about a Smart-Ass, like the Holmes charactor that we both love and hate?  Admire and Loathe, perhaps are better descriptive word choices.<br />If I had a friend like Holmes, as played by Robert Downey, Jr.  I would frequently find myself wanting to run out of the room with him and slam the door while exitting;  or just SLAP him on the back of his head!  Hahahaha!!!<br />I think the lines, the script is brilliant, but the WAY the lines this actor delivers them gives a great many many chuckles and joy, and I never find a Dull Moment in this video.
B001RLP862|3.0|Received items as promised from order place. But item quality is not good as it spec, it's tear off after 10 times plays. It's OK but not really good as it should be.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Absolutely recommend this series!  I couldn't put the books down.  Loved how the writer keeps you engaged at all times!
098555780X|5.0|My grandson said this book has a wealth of information in it, even for the beginner paracord hobbiest to learn.  Quick ship.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I finished this book the morning Mr. Kyle died. It's a fantastic read and I hope some of my funds went to the family. Kyle is a true hero.
B00846REIS|2.0|Very similar to the Fifty Shades book.  I had a hard time trying to finish the book.  A plus was that it was a quick read.

B004LROUNG|3.0|Like Grisham books and this book had a different angle than others. Found lots of humor in it and a light read.
B009JTCBLE|4.0|As the band states, this is a progression of the first two releases. Its a good release, though I must admit I liked the first two better. Still a worthy buy!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game! I have to think about where to make my next move and I am not bored playing it. It is challenging.
B000FCK8ZK|2.0|Slightly to predictable. Not nearly as detailed as the tv series and Dexter is a much darker character in this book than in the tv series.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie was just OK in my opinion.  It moved way to slow and at many times was very boring.  Way to much hype which probably helped in it's Best Picture award.  This is not one of those \\"Must Have\\" movies to add to my collection.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Because this book was written by John Grisham, I purchased it for my husband, who likes his books.  He was reading another book, so I read this one.  John may be running out of ideas after his many fabulous stories, as this one did not keep me interested and took me a very long time to read.  My husband chose not to read it after my comments.  Good luck, John, you can do much better.

B009G9Z08S|5.0|Spoiler alert for those who haven't read Frank Miller's original graphic novel...go get it and read it first.  If you have read it, flip through again right before you see this.  They even added more to the Superman/Batman smackdown to make it more realistic (that's part II, but still) than was contained in the graphic novel.  The rest was very true to the graphic novel, they went out of their way to not alienate the fans of the original piece of work and to make it all make more sense in the movie (see extras in part II).  There were extra fight scenes at the end of part II that helped the Superman/Batman conflict make more sense from a mortal Batman standpoint (i.e. the construction site scene with the I-beams).  All in all, a resounding production...and this from a Superman fan who still contends that if he was a heartless bastard he could've just blown Batman away instead of writing the word &#34;WHERE&#34; with his heat vision.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Love the game but am tired of all the commercials. And I don't want to pay for them to be removed or for more help things. Other than that, it's a fun and addictive game.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Sweet movie, !! and also good movie to teens.  I  (grandma) really liked it too.  I do recommend it for all ages.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game. It is very addictive and it is ad free so I just can't stop playing. One of the best games I have downloaded.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down even while I cared for a newborn I read it in two days! Great book.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I don't get this game. I have tried playing it numerous times but just don't seem to be able to do anything except push more coins into the bin. And it wants you to purchase more coins which I don't do. It was supposed to be a free game but apparently it is not.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I wish all the songs were on it, but I enjoy listening to this over and over.  Great buy for what was on it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love Mahjong and this works great on my Kindle Fire HD. Recommend it to anyone who loves to play Mahjong.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|I love this album, and I am glad I purchased it! I kept hearing songs from Christina Perri on Pandora and I enjoyed them so I opted for the album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game but I have not gotten past level 1. Guess I am not great at playing this type of game but will keep trying till I get it mastered.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|More books like this is what we need HAHAH YEAH I don't like reading at all and I couldn't put this book down read it it's a must
B00A757EFW|3.0|I wish there was more of it. Seems like there is only the one level??? I would love a real version for my Kindle Fire HD but can't seem to find one. I think this should have many levels but if there are more, I don't seem to be able to access them. Kinda disappointed.
B000VZJNYS|5.0|After the low point of &#34;Dynasty&#34; this in the minds of many that I knew brought KISS back to filling arenas. I remember this tour, and even without the makeup, KISS could still blow away the competition.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|There's a lot of television out there but this show is worth adding to ones collection. One of only 3 different shows that I cared to watch again.
B000002KDO|5.0|Popping this into my cd player listening to &#34;Sweet Leaf&#34; brought back so many memories of barracks life at the Naval Submarine Base, Point Loma, CA. Awesome timeless music. I just can't figure out to rip it to my computer! It keeps showing up as blank. is this an anti rip safeguard?
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Jupiter's Co*k. One of only three shows that I cared to watch again. I even felt it necessary to write this review as well
B000VZPCN4|3.0|Probably the lowest point in KISS's great career, but some of the songs aren't THAT bad. I guess you have to fall before you can rise again.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had almost finished this book when I started watching the HBO series (season 1) and was amazed at how closely it follows the book....right down to the dialogue!  I am very impressed and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a long time Sci-Fi reader and enjoy almost all of it from Heinlen to Asimov to Hamilton to Simmons to Stephenson. I stumbled onto Howey and the Wool Omnibus. Upon completion, I just bought 5 more titles from him. He's my new favorite.<br />Wool has just the right mix of character development, intrigue, science, tension, detail and cleverness to keep me engaged.<br /><br />I can't wait to get into the prequel/follow-up of Shift.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a sci-fi reader and have not discovered Hugh Howey, then you are in for a treat. Just click &#34;buy it&#34; and enjoy.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Hatebreed. The thrashing from beginning to end of every album was like a rush of speed. That being said, when the album 'for the lions' came out I was highly disappointed in it. I sampled this album before I purchased it to make sure I wasn't paying for another s*** album and ended up buying it. I LOVE IT!!! From the high energy sound to Jamie's vocals that get inside your soul and make you feel like you can get through anything. Fist up, Head high!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game just wish it gave you more options on how to play and how to save your coins.<br />It says you should be able to do that but i could not figure out how.<br />Needs more instructions on  how to play.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I only have a few Words for this movie.  I am so glad that people see that ANALOG is the real deal.  Excellent!!!
0375851569|5.0|This is a great set for our daughter. Because of her age (under 1 year) we only read a few pages of each book a night, but she has already started to pick her favorites. This set would be a great unique baby shower gift.
B009GED3HS|4.0|Not quite as good as seasons in the past, but still a great laugh... So sad that next season will be the last. Love these characters!
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Season 3 DVD has been radically edited. Much of the content seen on TV is missing. The final regular season episode is actually missing about 1 hour's worth of content. The whole Thomas-gets-in-trouble thing is completely missing. Much of the by play between Daisy and Ivy and Alfred is gone. If you want this just to remind you about the major plot lines, fine but this certainly isn't a good product.
B004LRNYJW|3.0|Film was shot very dark.  Pretty good acting.  No animals get hurt!  Not scary at all, so if you are looking for horror, I don't think it's a good choice.  But it was good.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Very good book, suspenseful. Surprising twist at the end, ready to read the next book! Cassandra Clare is a great author!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The acting is (too) great and highly believable but the story appears muddled and disjointed. I regret spending two hours watching Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman try to one-up each other's performance. Joaquin is on the comeback trail after spitting in the face of Hollywood but this performance is too excessive for the role. We know he can act but it is apparent that he is trying too hard to prove that he is the &#34;best&#34; actor in Hollywood. That chip on his shoulder is clearly getting in the way of his acting. Hoffman does quite well as &#34;Master&#34; but, again, his attempt is more than what the role calls for. Amy Adams is amazing and it is apparent that she has checked her ego at the door, unlike Phoenix and Hoffman. I recommend The Master for those who are fans of period pieces, notably 1945-1950, and over-acting; otherwise, skip it and watch one of the other movies that came out this year for a more enjoyable evening (Argo, The Avengers, Pitch Perfect, etc.).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome.best game I have ever played.Number one game.GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />If  you get this game you will have no regrets
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It's not the best movie ever made but it should be considered one of the top 100. Argo sets the new standard for ensemble performances. The acting was amazing and everyone kept their egos in check. Ben Affleck's outstanding direction was apparent in every aspect of the movie. It was not only a great re-telling of one of the most important rescue operations in American history but it finally gave Tony Mendez, the CIA operative who conducted the rescue, the credit he deserved for standing up to bureaucracy in the name of human lives. Ben Affleck deserved Best Director or, at the very least, a nomination but the Academy isn't ready for such greatness. It only took them 5 nominations to finally realize Scorsese deserved an award so Ben should be getting his first directing Oscar sometime in the late 2020s. It's truly hard to believe that Ben wone the Golden Globe and Critic's Choice Award for Best Director yet the Academy failed to even nominate him. Instead they give the Oscar to a director of the movie that required the least amount of direction.<br /><br />Argo is well worth your time and money.
0307887448|4.0|Though I wish there was less profanity, it was an awesome book. It is hard to put down. It is easy to get in to if you grew up in the 80s or like science fiction or fantasy. I don't recommend this for young readers due to the profanity but an adult would enjoy this book.
B000008DXB|5.0|Simply put--a great album! Love the songwriting and how his voice fits perfectly with the songs. He is a true original artist minus the hype.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game I play it ALOT.I love it. This game is challenging. You basically have to guess what the next object is.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Its pretty nice and basic, does the job well and looks good. The four stars are because it does kind of scuff up easily and the lid does not always turn the kindle off. Other than that its good.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It wouldn't let me Download the Rome version and got really mad so that is why I am not rating this good
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Perhaps one of my best used apps on Kindle Fire and on my phone. Never caught without knowing how to spell a word or get the definition to a new one.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My kids and I agree, this was the best animated movie of 2012.  We highly recommend you give it a try!!
0374214913|4.0|Some people read to learn. Others look for excitement, adventure and thrills. For me reading is relaxation. For me, Penumbra's Twenty Four Hour Bookshop was a short holiday at Geekwarts. Like J.K Rowling the writer managed to create a fantasy world parallel to the real world: a world of books, secret codes and mystery. It was fun escaping into this world for a couple hours. It was a lovely escape from the everyday because there were happy endings for all. However, the book did have one flaw. It was a bit too glib. Characters leaped from challenge to challenge with too little effort.<br />Also the ending left me feeling like I missed something. It was like one of those fancy meals which have an elaborate presentation but leave you still feeling hungry.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I loved this CD.  It is a beautiful collection of songs sung by an amazing talent.  It is very hard for me to pick a favorite.  I loved them all!!
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|I thought it was a little too dry and matter of fact for me.  Helen Hunt is kind of flat and cold-antiseptic, almost.  John Hawkes, however, is awesome and worth watching. I think a film can be warm without being fuzzy and this one is neither warm nor fuzzzy.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|The movie was so true to the book which was fantastic. Wonderful story that was recreated for the screen with pure genius.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|As usual, Andrea satisfys with his ultra smooth, beautiful voice! A nice mix of contemporary and old Italian favorites. A must have.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In the 0.7.0 update you should add in the following: buckets. potatoes. squids. infinate world. villages. chat. potions. redstone. fishing rod. enchantments. and anyone with wi-fi on can join your world. kinds like a server. THX!!! By the way I love this game!!!!!!!!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Another great cd from Josh Groban. What a beautiful gift he has. You can never go wrong with this great singer.
0670022705|4.0|Here is a fascinating book, which brings to life the long history of man's development in all sciences and art.  Belongs on everyone's shelf.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|it is a fun game and you can pass hours by fast was good as the sudoku that i have
B004TI5N38|4.0|I have read many of David Baldacci's books in the past and enjoyed this new series.  I eagerly await the next in the series.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Very good...would have been even better if had shown how Bond came out of the bloody frozen lake or pond??!\\"&%$#@...am sad that \\"M\\" had an unhappy ending but I like the actor succeeding her...but sure still miss M's unforgettable voive...so stoic andcommanding. The next Bond has got to be even better eh?
B004XANKVO|5.0|It fits everything well and has held up on my trips to New York, Miami, Arizona.  Fits under the seat on a plane.
B001DELX08|5.0|In the wake of avante garde stagings of Verdi's ever popular masterpiece, this 2007 La Scala performance of the 1980's production of La Traviata is nothing less than being the `definitive' modern version.<br />Being Asian, I confess I have great difficulty in following most of the avante garde operatic productions.  When seen in its proper period setting, the story and the performance really makes a whole lot of difference in terms of understanding as well as enjoyment of the work itself.  The sets and staging in this 2007 La Scala performance is simply sublime.  The choregraphy and dancing are also highly accomplished.  More than any thing else, the title role, portrayed by Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu, is nothing short of being perfect both visually, dramatically and musically.<br />In this Gheorghiu's reprisal of Violetta Valery, her signature role, demonstrates not only a seasoned and in depth reading of the role, but also a performance of utter emotional commitment.  Throughout the different Acts and stages of the character's development, Gheorghiu performs with complete abandonment, her vocal acting and dramatic portrayal are nothing less than total identification with the heroine. Her short parting words with Alfredo after the emotionally turbulent scene with Pere Germont are sung with unbelievable dramatic effect. Her final Act aria after reading Germont's letter is a tear wrenching and heart breaking out burst, and her brief resuscitation to high spirits whips up the audiences' sense of despair with Violetta.  It is a rare complete emersion into a role that calls for great emotional stretches, and Gheorghiu's performance is difficult to be surpassed.<br />As her lover Alfredo, Mexican tenore di grazie Ramon Vargas brings into this Verdian role the rarely heard bel canto elegance, at least not heard since the other great Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza's Alfredo (which was never formally documented). Vargas' performance matches Gheorghiu's point by point, if not visually as convincing as Gheorghiu.<br />Roberto Frontali's Pere Germont is another powerful performance. This all too down to earth figure undergoes several emotional twists as the plot develops as well, and Frontali's handles the twists with expert finesse vocally and dramatically., if not visually as convincing as Gheorghiu.<br />Roberto Frontali's Pere Germont is another powerful performance. This all too down to earth figure undergoes several emotional twists as the plot develops as well, and Frontali's handles the twists with expert finesse vocally and dramatically.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, at first I had the free version of it and I loved it but now that I have the full paid version, I have a lot more fun! I highly recommend this app it is totally worth the money.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I am sad to say that Connelly has lost his touch. Bosch is one of my favorite characters, but The Black Box was boring and slow-moving. The first few chapters start well and the last few end well, but in between is lots of wordiness and unnecessary filler. When I realized I was losing interest because of this I started counting.....a sequence where Bosch takes his daughter to a police shooting practice was 23 pages of words about how she shot, how he shot, the targets, etc.. Not one thing to do with the plot. Then after they shot they went to eat and that turned into another 25 pages of conversation about how the shooting went and why Bosch became a cop and what they ate....none of it related to the murder investigation; and other examples too numerous to mention here. What a waste of my time. I believe that my favorite authors have run out of ideas and words to fill a 400+ page book with quality. I am finding the same problem with James Patterson (Alex Cross series) and Lee Child (Reacher series). I am holding out hope that there is still a good book or two in you Mr. Connelly. Try harder!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great and so addicting at first all I did wad play slots but not any more my 11 yr old introduced me to this game
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I hear they're in talks for a Season 2... (Wishful Thinking) Nathan Fillion and the rest of the cast have great chemistry! The show was definitely ahead of its time!
B0071CNGI8|5.0|I saw the movie and was very moved by it. The book was told from the horse's point of view. Very good.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It made me cry, laugh, and smile and that's all I need the book to do to me. Love it!
B00BHMEALA|3.0|Only interesting character in the movie...<br /><br />No development of the supposed expertise of the hero, &#34;I get people out.&#34; You do, do you? How's that? Where, when?<br /><br />&#34;Trust me!!!&#34; Yeah, right, buddy.
B009ZTLPJM|4.0|If you like Soundgarden you will like this album. I myself enjoyed listening to the album and have listen to it for at least 5 times so far.
B00B5HQL50|1.0|The worst Bond movie of all time. Insipid, boring, tedious, ponderous...just awful...how could someone pay for this? A great sedative...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a calculator. it works. it is easy to use and I like it. you should get this calculator.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The book was good but I wouldn't give it top rating since I like books that have a story that could actually happen in real life.
1569242739|5.0|This is one of my favorite Isa and Terry cookbooks. Fun and funky, there is a recipe for everybody here-EVEN SPECIAL DIET CUPCAKES (woohoo-doing a happy dance!!!) And better yet, most are made with pantry staples, so you can whip up a batch of cupcakes anytime!! My favorite are the golden cupcakes with chocolate icing-total crowd pleasers that even the die-hard \\"Eww, Vegan!\\" folks chow down on and ask for the recipe (bwhahahaha!! )Beautifully illustrated, this is one cookbook that the finished product look just like the pictures (even for the culinarily challenged like me!!) I can't recommend this cookbook highly enough. Buy a copy, Right now.
0307346609|5.0|I like this book a lot.<br /><br />Brooks has taken the typical Zombie theme in a different direction.  The book is the post-war interviews of survivors of a major cataclysm.  It talks about the nations' responses to an epidemic...  and is also quite entertaining.<br /><br />Recommend.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I spend many hours on this game. You just can't put it down! Spend the .99 cents and get it. You will get hooked on it also. It makes the time fly by. A great challenge; with three different game plays. I like the puzzle mode the best, but play the other modes from time to time. Fast paced action.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|But I was optimistic.  I bought this due to the names associated with it:  Tarantino, Crowe, Liu?<br /><br />The movie was a two hour snooze fest...  like really... I fell asleep within 20 minutes.  It took me 3 times to finally watch it through the end.<br /><br />I was looking forward to a modern, cheesy Kung Fu throwback with decent hip-hop to make it more fun.<br />Didn't get any of that.<br /><br />Don't waste your time/money...
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Love everything about this. All the characters are hilarious. You can't help but love Sheldon despite his condescending attitude. In my opinion,  this is the best comedy currently on TV.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This is one of the better takes on Sherlock I have come across.  They mix the mystery with the adventure and do an amazing job at showing you exactly how this brilliant mind works.<br /><br />I recommend this show for everyone.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who is a Zelda enthusiast.  She didnt even know they had come out with it in english format.  The artwork is beautiful and the book itself is definatley a collectors item!  We are very pleased with it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|You know when you are all ready to go except for that one roommate or girlfriend who is still in the bathroom?  Break out the zombie dice.<br /><br />really - you just throw them, count them, and score.<br /><br />I recommend every household have a set of these in the living room for just that occasion...  also you could buy the iphone ap and play it on the train.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great insight into foster children and our system.  Easy read and very enjoyable. Story also deals with family relationships.<br />Definitely recommended.
B004132I20|5.0|This is one of the better takes on Sherlock I have come across.  They mix the mystery with the adventure and do an amazing job at showing you exactly how this brilliant mind works.<br /><br />I recommend this show for everyone.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album has heart and one with a good beat at that.  The songs are catchy, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis write great lyrics to go along with great stories.  This is one album that I can recommend to anyone with a remote interest in hip hop and maybe those that don't.  It comes with a good message, too.
B008CP6RWU|1.0|These are great games! Perfect for someone who loves creativity, beauty, relaxing game play. But this is a review on the PRODUCT ITSELF!!!<br /><br />Buying these games in a bundle and trying to save room on my hardrive seemed like the perfect way to go, being the fact that they are \\"disc based\\" now. However, not only do you have to use the disc to play them, you still have to install them onto your console. So instead of taking up the X amount of space on my hardrive after purchasing them on psn and being able to play them with the push of a button. They now take up the same X amount of space on my hardrive AND I have to make sure the disc is in the system in order to play them, even though they are installed as if they were a psn purchase. O_O This was a horrible way to market these works of art and I strongly suggest you join \\"psn plus\\" and download them at a discount, otherwise you are just going to waste the space without the convenience. The 3 bonus mini games provided are not really much fun, but they are pretty much the only perk to buying these games this way.<br /><br />~HXC
B009G8GRX6|4.0|This is my second album in with Muse.  After the last one, The Resistance, I found myself saying 'nah, there won't be a second'.  It had a couple of good songs on there, but nothing spectacular.  Lo and behold, Amazon had a great deal on this album and it was well worth the purchase.  There's a few good tracks on there and I think it's a solid 4/5, as you can see.  Still, nothing spectacular.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|I love Jeffrey Archer and he never disappoints! The story is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />I look forward to book 3!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My girlfriend and I rather like this show.  It has some interesting interactions between higher and lower class and how they can intermingle but how its looked down upon.  Its interesting to see how it progresses throughout the year.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very fun keeps me interested easy lots of coins and prizes fun sounds good game to pass time a****** recommend
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Carafe overflows regularily even though water and coffee are accurately measured.  Carafe design is poor as it is difficult to pour the final cup or two of each pot.  This is caused by the lid design and the vertical sides of the carafe.  The carafe must be completely inverted to pour remaining coffee.<br />Other less expensive brands offer a better value.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|Recommend this book to anyone who is interested in looking behind the curtain to begin to see how statistics are misused to fool the public .
B001HBWY8M|5.0|this is one of my old favorites, for a clean romantic comedy! it has lots of action and an all around good plot.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I haven't read a King novel in some time and it showed his skill as an author been stepping outside the horror or supernatural scope.  Great unexpected ending!
B0050IY61G|5.0|Good coverage of what is Asperger's Syndrome - highly recommend. No advice on how to cope with it, but that is not it's aim.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|If you expect Hugh Laurie to sound like a masculine Adele, you'll be sorely disappointed.  He is not, as is clearly stated, a trained singer.  He's a wonderful pianist and a man who sings from his soul.  Is it a little nasal?  Sure.  Are some of the songs a little archaic?  Unless you are a Delta Blues buff, you bet.  But if your idea of good music is a song from a man who honors the lyrics and the notes with every breath, then this is your album.
B00846REIS|5.0|The introduction of the Crossfire characters in this book leads you to the eager acquisition of the second book.  Action is paced so that the reader does not become bored.  Character development allows the reader to become quickly involved with the characters.  When I read a book like this, it becomes a part of me.  Anyone who enjoys a passionate love story that is not just a walk in the sunshine will enjoy this. You struggle with the characters, share their troubles, you are jubilant with their joy.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Very good app. Works perfectly and i would recommend this app to any one that enjoys playing chess. Best part is that its free.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have been able to spend many a Happy hour playing this game and I will try to spend many more because it does have some cool little graphics and  you have got to love Scrat and Sid.I have had no problems on my Kindle Fire with loading up,but I have had a few friends that I cannot visit but that's OK,it takes nothing from the fun.
B009E9QOEO|1.0|Hardcore Zeppelin fan.  Owned all the 8-Tracks, own all the vinyl, owned all the CD's twice (original & remaster).  I love Led Zeppelin.  However, the Celebration Day CD's sound like a bad bootleg of a horrible sounding concert at a dumpy stadium somewhere in the Midwest.  The mix is beyond awful and is painful to listen to.  Calling the recording muddy and disjointed is probably being generous.  These are the worst sounding CD's I have in my 800+ CD collection.  I listened to the CD's 10 times to see if they got better.  They did not.  Don't blame the band, blame the mix and the person doing the recording.  I can't believe that this recording was even listened to by anyone associated with Zeppelin prior to release. Clearly there is no quality control.  It's a shame since this was a great opportunity to showcase the band.  Do not buy.  The Celebration Day CD's should never have been released.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Its ok, but I would of liked it to be longer. Animashan and grafics where verey good outher than the monkey. If your looking for a good game to play on a little free time thene this is the game for you.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Just finished the last book and didn't want it to end. JK knows how to tell a story and the movie did not disappoint. It was engaging from the first scenes. Naturally there was no time for the character development or detail that the novel allows, but it was a close match. The kids continue their superb acting and the special effects are well done. I do wish I didn't have to buy it in two parts.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|At first, it's a good app, really.... you take videos, have fun , and be happy... that is, untill you reach your &quot;video limit&quot; and have to pay ! Why can't it be FREE??? However, the camera action is free, it's useless because the kindle fire hd is already capable of taking pictures. I, personally, would not recommend this app unless you only want to take ten videos.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I understand people are upset because the originals are not included but that should not merit a one-star score for this blu-ray set. These copies look and sound fantastic! I've seen the original cuts and prefer the updated versions much more. Sure, consider my opinion bias for being born in '91 and spoiled on CG my whole life but technology has changed the past 30+ years. The original trilogy is still timeless, Jar-Jar is still annoying and shrill, AotC is still terrible, the rock R2 is hiding behind DOES disappear, the Ewoks do have eyelids, Vader's lightsaber is NOT pink, Darth Vader does say \\"NOOOOO\\" at the end of RotJ, and, yes, Greedo still shots first. But who really cares? The integrity of the movies are still there as well as the magic that keeps me coming back for more! All the bonus material is really cool as well. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the missing documentaries from the DVD's. Other than that, buy this set!
B007SGM084|5.0|I give this set of books a five star rating. The only thing that I found that I didn't like was that it wasn't longer.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|This is a really good budget Intel CPU.  Most of us really don't need to overclock our CPUs. The graphics card does most of the work. Speaking of graphics you all probably know that the built-in Intel HD4000 graphics in this CPU could help you get by until you buy a dedicated graphics card.  You won't be able to play blu-ray movies if you have a blu-ray/dvd rw drive thought.  The Intel HD4000 won't do it because of the blu-ray playing software incompatabilty.  So if you are in a pinch for money and have a lower wattage power supply I recommend a Nvidia GT640 card.  It requires no external power.  If gaming is your intention get the Nvidia GTX660 as it is the best bang for the buck.  This CPU runs most games very well when a good processor is needed.  You should be happy.  Also I would like to recommend using Tuniq-2, a non-conductive thermal grease, and a Zalman 9500LED air-cooling cpu fan.  I like to keep the CPU cooler and have a long-lifed CPU.  I know overclockers like to go as cool as possible but it's not a bad idea when running stock CPU-speed too.  Last I want to warn you to forget about Artic-Silver for your thermal paste. It is conductive. I put too much on years back and shorted out an overclocked Intel Duo CPU.  I hope I have helped you and if not you know more than I do. :)
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is the most original movie I've ever seen. It gives a different prespective on all the classic games, including such icons as pac-man and sonic and every one  of your favorite villians. I really wish they would've gone through a few more games or introduced a few more new or iconic characters, but I believe this could easily be achieved in an even better, more action packed, sequel. I highly reccomend this movie for people of all ages.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Everyone who believes in what our soldiers do for our country should read this book for a full understanding of what they do and how they achieve our freedom.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting. Its not too challenging and not to easy either. I honestly can never put it down and have wasted hours playing this game.

B00004UEDQ|4.0|Love this LIGHT entertainment featuring Sandra Bullock at her best.  Although the movie is no award winner, she is perfect, as always, in bringing to life a tragic character who manages to redeem herself through humor and heartache.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I enjoy this game very much but am frequently frustrated trying to open it. Today, for example, all I get is pictures of other games to try.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|A thought-provoking view of something we all wonder about. Dr. Alexander knows what he is talking about from a medical as well as a personal perspective.
B000FC1MOQ|1.0|I went to return it but there is not that option. I did not want this book, I just wanted to read the summary and on accident I pushed &#34;purchase&#34; and instead of asking me to confirm I wanted it to download a screen popped up saying it was successfully purchased.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|This is the last (as of now) book in the Shopaholic series by Sophie Kinsella.  I started the first one in early January on the strong recommendation of a friend and worked my way through them all in about eight weeks.  This is not typical for me to move through an entire series this quickly, but I found myself really enjoying them and wanted to find out what scrape Becky was going to find herself in.<br /><br />This installment finds Becky at the ripe old age of 29 with a two-year-old daughter named Minnie.  Needless to say, Becky's lack of self-control has spilled over into her parenting style and Minnie is a little terror.  She wants everything she sees and Becky sees no reason not to give it to her.  Concurrently in the story, there is a major banking crisis which prompts Luke to encourage Becky to cut back her spending --- she agrees to wear everything in her closet more than once before buying something new.  As with all her resolutions, things don't work out quite as planned and seeing the train wreck that ensues is a large part of the fun.<br /><br />As narcissistic as the main character is, I think I would find her irritating but don't.  She is funny and crazy and I love seeing how she gets herself into and out of all these ridiculous situations.  By the end of the book, she will have turned her situation around and come out smelling like a rose.  I will add a comment here that I am not sure how additional books will be received if Becky doesn't grow up and mature. The crazy thinking and lack of learning something from her experiences works as a woman in her 20s but I don't think it will come off as well as she is in her 30s and parenting a toddler.<br /><br />This was a good, lighthearted read with crazy situations that often made me chuckle.
B009FZZFME|5.0|With the highest body count of any episode to date, the gore hounds will love this one. The episode does a several month fast forward--Lori is visibly pregnant--and hunger is a problem for the survivors. There is a scene involving a can of dog food that really sparked a conversation in our home. The AMC sync even had a question about whether or not it was right for Rick to stop Karl from eating it...surprisingly, almost 70% of the poll agreed. I'm sorry, but lack of protein and starvation opens up a lot of menu choices.<br /><br />One thing is clear, Rick is the leader of the band and his word is law. Karl has obviously been learning on the fly and is actually a help instead of the errant child of last season. (The best thing about that is that now we can focus on despising Lori for other things.)<br /><br />There is minimal dialog in this episode. The characters have to carry the episode with expressions and body language. I highly recommend watching this episode more than once just to observe how expertly these people stay in character. There is a great moment between Daryl and Carol that breaks the tension and earns some laughs.<br /><br />The early dilemma besides food is Lori's soon-to-arrive &#34;bundle of joy&#34;. The possibility of having the baby on the run is not appealing. When they stumble upon the prison, there is a belief that they have found refuge. All that remains is to clear it out. My only problem with that sequence was the number of blind corners. It leads to great suspense, but prisons are all about big open spaces and long, straight corridors.<br /><br />We get a peek at Michonne. She is on the move with Andrea, who is suffering from the flu or some similar ailment. It is clear that they have built a bond during their time since meeting in the woods at the end of season two.<br /><br />The effects are, as always, top notch. The best thing I saw was the return towards the storyline that those of us who read the graphic novels came to love.<br /><br />Naturally, the episode ends with a dramatic event. I don't think that this series needs to use hooks any longer. The fan base isn't leaving.<br /><br />Let's hope that this is what we have to look forward to in season three. For many, the second season was just a bit flat at times until the final two episodes.<br />The episode one ending introduced us to some potential new characters...a group of inmates holed up in the prison cafeteria. Surprisingly, they turn out to be a &#34;less-than-desirable&#34; group. I was actually surprised that Rick tolerated them as long as he did. When things go sour--one particular inmate makes an obvious attempt on Rick in the chaos--Rick doesn't delegate to Daryl, and instead, gets the nomination for the &#34;Tom Savini Machete Kill of the Year&#34;. If that moment was not a direct nod to the original Dawn of the Dead, then it is the best unintentional homage ever!<br /><br />One of the most entertaining lines of the show has to fall into a similar category. There is no secret that Lori is possibly the most hated woman on television. She has been a regular &#34;bad Mother&#34; poster on an almost episodic basis. I believe that fans of the show got a &#34;We love you&#34; note from the writers and producers when Lori, during a scene with Rick, says, &#34;Look, I know that I'm a shitty wife...and I'm not winning any Mother-of-the-Year awards...&#34; Truer words were never spoken...<br /><br />Concerns over Hershel continue, and one of the best &#34;Made ya jump&#34; moments involves him and Lori. It is nice that Kirkman and company took a little veer off of the normal zombie track and allow for the possibility of survival of the area can be amputated (a fact that will be the doom for one of the inmates). Romero fans all recall the arm amputation scene from Day of the Dead.<br /><br />The honorary Boy Scout award goes to Carol. It is almost like taking a look back in time to when medicine was in its infancy. Before people were allowed to donate their bodies to science and grave-robbers were making a lucrative business delivering cadavers to would-be healers, the human body was a real mystery.<br /><br />In closing, with Rick's new attitude, how many people think that maybe he and Shane were really two peas in a pod. There is a harsh side to the aspect of survival that Shane understood from day one. His only downfall was his obsession with Lori.<br /><br />Overall, episode two hits the ground running and offers a few new &#34;questions&#34;...like who was watching Carol from the bushes...and where are Andrea and Michonne?<br /><br />Season 3, episode 3...or &#34;Merle, is that a knife in your pocket...or are you just glad to see me?&#34; Yes, there was little doubt that Merle would resurface. Honestly, as a fan of the graphic novels, I figured that he would become &#34;The Governor&#34;. Instead, they decided to give us a Ted Bundy type instead of the blatantly obvious bad guy.<br /><br />I must admit that I watch the AMC Storysync with each episode during its premiere. When questions come up like &#34;SHould Andrea and Michonne stay or leave, and a quarter of the voters pick &#34;Stay&#34;, then I have to wonder what the hell show they are watching. Whether or not you have read the series is irrelevant, The Governor drips evil. How is anybody missing that?<br /><br />This episode is all about Andrea and Michonne arriving at Woodbury. Now this tiny community of 73 (soon to be 74) citizens is just waiting to be exposed as a haven for evil. The question that remains is how many of the citizens are &#34;in on it.&#34; With Merle walking around free (but seemingly very much under the thumb of The Governor if you pay close attention to one scene) and a man in a dark lab performing experiments on the walkers (or biters as the Woodbury people call them), you just know the facade will have to crack.<br /><br />Right now, Michonne seems to be the only one keeping a healthy distrust. Andrea is either playing The Governor, or she is starting to sip from the Kool-Aid. That remains to be seen. However, if there is any doubt about The Governor, that is put to rest in the end. As an owner of several aquariums...I was a little put off by his collection.lowed to donate their bodies to science and grave-robbers were making a lucrative business delivering cadavers to would-be healers, the human body was a real mystery.<br /><br />In closing, with Rick's new attitude, how many people think that maybe he and Shane were really two peas in a pod.

B00BHMETKC|2.0|How this film got the awards that it did is a mystery to me. It surely didn't live up to it's hype. I would compare it to one of the better episodes of the Mission Impossible TV series. The true story is told, but without any penache.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Well written but the background story with the drugs and infidelity and promiscuousness  spoiled it a bit for me. Why can't a &#34;normal&#34; woman write a book like this for a change?
B009FZFONO|5.0|Such an intriguing show with create character development and nonstop action. The show very gory, so if you are squeamish, this might not be the show for you. We started season 1 two weeks ago and were so hooked we watch season 1 and 2 and now are on 3. I can hardly wait until the next episode, they always leave you guessing!
B00766CLPI|4.0|I've always been very fond of this album.  It's serene arrangements, melodies and vocals are ever more enhanced by the two additional tracks.  You must have a listen.
0062200909|5.0|Really nice quality pictures and a storyboard type walk through the greatest of fantasy and JRR's works.  I love the behind the scenes views of detail that passes too quickly on the screen.
B0001CNRBG|2.0|I was unable to watch this DVD as it was not made for this area (Australia).  This could be due to the fact that it was made in Mexico and not in the US. I wasted my money on a movie that I really needed to watch.
0670024813|5.0|As mainstream Taiwan rushes to discard everything distinctive and traditional in a headlong race to \\"get international,\\" aborigines are turning back to their original cultures for inspiration and identity. I live in a Dayan (Tayal) village, and have many friends in the Tsou, Truku, Sediq, Amis, Puyuma, and other tribes, so over the years I have spent a lot of time observing and discussing many of the issues Diamond brings up in this excellent book. If you don't have a bunch of friends from tribal villages (or even if you do), but would like a lot of food for thought about this topic, this is the book for you.<br />What can traditional culture offer to keep us hale and hearty in modern Taiwan? Everything from dances and songs to bond with others, to language to learn from the ancients, to the many varieties of indigenous millet that are being revived. There is an intriguing mixing. Just yesterday I saw a photo of a young Puyuma wearing traditional clothes and a trilby. Quite a combination!<br />The traditional world has a great deal for us to recall. After all, their methods were tried and tested over millennia. We have to advantage that we may choose and discard, but remember to choose, not just discard.<br />The main thing I have to say to you about this book is: read it, it's good. I have two quibbles, nothing serious. First, Plate 34 shows a \\"Chinese\\" trader presenting his papers, but if you look carefully, you'll see that's a Viet Namese passport. Second, on p456 he says Ishi grew fond of railroad trains. I can't track it down at the moment, but I remember that he loved trolley cars, and rode them for hours, but thought trains were oppressive. I could be wrong. Big deal, read the book, you'll enjoy it. You don't have to agree with everything, but these are issues worth thinking about.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|The acting in this movie is superb, totally professional  I couldn't fault ant member of the cast.  Fast paced, I was totally caught up and caught up that I forgot that I was watching a movie and became immersed in the brilliantly written script.  I found it impossible to single out a particular actor as each member
0670023329|5.0|Shin Dong-Hyuk was born a slave in a North Korean concentration camp. He was so isolated from the outside world that he didn't even know what money is. His life was in the hands of the guards. I simply cannot, and do not wish to, understand how anybody could treat other human beings so cruelly. This cruelty is not just the sadism of guards, it is institutional brutality, planned by Kim Il Song, one of history's most atrocious tyrants; his son Kim Jong Il comes close behind. Now power is in the hands of Kim Jong-Un, and maybe his Western education will bear fruit. He needs time, because he is in a very delicate situation. His is young, and there are a lot of entrenched powers at work who could depose him in a moment. He has to tread carefully. For the time being, I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, watch for signs of reform, and look forward to a more humane North Korea.<br />That said, the day after I finished reading this book, some American basketball player visited North Korea and praised all three generations of Kims as \\"great leaders.\\" On the one hand, it is good that North Korea is allowing foreign athletes to visit, because exchange, and knowledge of the outside world is sure to help thaw things out. On the other hand, it is immoral to promote any form of government that you would not live under as a typical citizen. Unless Mr Basketball Player would live in a typical North Korean city, subject to possibly being placed in a place like Camp 14 just like all the other people in that country, then he should keep his mouth shut.<br />Let us all spend a moment in thought for the people of North Korea, and hope their lot improves quickly. Many thanks to Blaine Harden for writing this book, and much admiration for Shin Dong-Hyuk for his bravery, indomitable will, and strength. Good luck to him, and North Korea.
B002PZ6XB8|5.0|One of the most inspiring movies for artists and anyone with a dream.  It encourages to dedicate yourself to your art and after some time things will fall into place.  You will be rewarded even if your own loved ones are against you.  Be strong and you don't always need a lot of friends, your work and your creations can be your friends and they can accompany you on your way to greatness.  God will give you meaningful friends to share your journey with you, and sometimes bad things happen that are horrible but we are able to bounce back understand ourselves and do what makes us happy rather what is for everyone else.  One of my favorite movies.

B00BETX5PS|3.0|Alright, so I'm not a big Bond fan, and after watching this movie I know why. Some of the events in the film were just ridiculous, and I found myself reaching the limits of my own willingness to suspend disbelief. The fall at the beginning, in particular, was just plain absurd--300 feet off a bridge and land head first in a river? Not thinking anyone could survive that...even Bond.

0307949508|5.0|When I first started the Millenium Trilogy, I'll admit I didn't think I was going to like it at all. The first 100 pages was really dry, and I just couldn't get into it. Thankfully, I stuck with it. By the middle of the first book, I was hooked. And at the end, I knew I just had to keep reading.<br /><br />The character I connected with most has to be Lisbeth Salander. I like her because she's rebellious, but not in a typical, almost trendy, teenage way. She's quick on her feet, both mentally and physically, and she can melt into the crowd easily. She's different. She doesn't follow normal social convention.<br /><br /> I think the reason I like her so much is because I envy her confidence,<br /><br /> I also really admire the fact that she sticks up for her moral beliefs. Although, I don't necessarily like all of the violence that accompanies her actions and belief system, I understand it. Especially now, after reading The Girl Who Played With Fire and finding out so much more about her past.<br /><br />That has to be one of the aspects I was most pleased with about TGWPWF. As I read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I remember saying to myself, \\"I really wish there was more detail about Lisbeth.\\" I noticed in a lot of the other reviews I read that many people thought that there was too much background information, and they didn't like TGWPWF as much because of it.<br /><br />Not me. I'm one of those readers who likes to get fully engrossed in the character and their background. The  more detail you can give me, the better. That's part of the reason I kept reading. Larsson gave me just enough info about Salander to keep me hooked into wondering if there'd be more about her in the next book, and he did not disappoint.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert**<br />And now, with the revelation that Lisbeth has a twin sister, I find myself wanting to know more about Camilla. How is she different from Lisbeth? What role did she really play in everything? What does she really think of Lisbeth?<br />***End Spoiler***<br /><br />Generally, I'm not much on thriller stories, but this one flows really well, and the action clips along at a pace that's not too fast, but fast enough to keep you hooked and wanting to read on. The violent scenes are done tastefully, as are the numerous sex scenes.<br /><br />The supporting characters in this story are really varied, which works out well. The different (albeit few) people in Salander's circle are so different that sometimes it's hard to see how they might have all come to know her. But  once you find out the circumstances, and more about their backgrounds, it makes sense as to why they care for her so much, and she for them.<br /><br />There is one little quirky detail, that stuck out in my mind and I want to mention it just to see if anyone else noticed it or has any thoughts on it. I noticed that almost every time that Salander went to pick up food, and a couple of times when Blomkvist went to get food they always went to 7-Eleven. And they didn't just get junk, they got staple foods like bread and cheese and apples. Now, when I think of 7-Eleven, I think of soda, chips, and junk food, not apples, cheese and bread. It was just interesting to me that Larsson used 7-Eleven instead of a grocery store. Did anyone else notice this? If so what do you think?<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't read it yet, but I have to say, for the last 40 pages I went through a gamut of emotions ranging from \\"hell yeah she's going to get them\\" to \\"Dammit!\\" to \\"Wow, that really didn't end how I thought it would.\\"<br /><br />And just like that, I'm hooked in for the next book.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a gripping adventure, and unusual characters.of Lisbeth?<br />***End Spoiler***<br /><br />Generally, I'm not much on thriller stories, but this one flows really well, and the action clips along at a pace that's not too fast, but fast enough to keep you hooked and wanting to read on.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Blu ray movies for 30 bucks plus substantial packaging and a nice litle picture book. Honestly I'm in it for the movies.  That alone justifies the buy. The difference in blu day and DVD is amazing. I previously owned The Dark Knight and Batman Begins on DVD. The upgrades made sense and are definitely a good move.

I always admire any book that can make me laugh out loud or cry [because I am not easily moved to tears]. This book did both, often within the same page. This was a most enjoyable emotional roller coaster ride of a read. I highly recommend this book and have already done so to my book loving friends.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The description of the product was just as it said, and I appreciate that.  When buying things online sometimes they look different once you have received it, but the Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Case Cover by Marware is worth the money I paid for it plus more.  Thanks.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my second reading of the book and I find that I love the book more the second time around. Collins did  a great job creating  a  completely different world in which the reader can feel so involved. If you enjoy dystopian type reading this is certainly the book for you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very good book but was very adultish. Probably for kids in high school or older! Really is like a kid going through HS and how hard it is

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book. Simultaneously enlightening and entertaining. A bold look into one of the most private people in the world. A true genius of our time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire.  I was a little nervous since I wasn't sure if it would work and needed, for sure, to be woke up at a certain time.  However, the app worked great, was easy to set up, and I was able to be up and ready on time.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|I have read most of the rebus books. And this the best. The only things didn't like is that Malcolm fox is a bad guy.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Still no commentary on this?  Spielberg just won't give it up.  If he wouldn't sit down and do one on this movie, then he'll never do one.  Of all his movies this is the one I'd expect to have it.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Amazing movie-the visual affect was incredible and the theme of spirituality with love as the central motivation was inspiring. Highly recommend it.
B007ONSLLQ|3.0|Didn't realize there would be sooo much cursing. I knew some but was suprised. Wasn't as good as the first cd.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|sometimes got the feeling instructional film I watched and was surprised to see these two main actors inthis film but they saved the film
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Who would have imagined that you could take a schlocky early '60s horror movie and turn it into such a fun musical? But this is much more than just fun. The songs are even more amazing today than I remembered them. The puppetry (no CGI here!) is second to none, and the whole story just rings with emotion and comedy. I watched this with my 10-y-o niece and nephew, and they absolutely loved it (and had no idea what was going on with Bill Murray).
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I would reccomend this to people who Like series tv . the Characters mesh good together and if you are History buff great show to watch
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Awesome book, couldn't put it down, and couldn't stop thinking about it if I did! Well worth whatever I paid for it!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Old school, fun for kids,  Worked fine on Kin Fire ver.  Kids loved it.  they say lots of fun.<br />Thanks
B001EYGOG0|5.0|What's not to like about Tony Bennett. All of his albums are great and this one is no exception.<br />We should have bought it before Christmas so we could have enjoyed it longer.
0307744434|5.0|How much did I like this debut novel? I bought a second copy to give to my daughter for Christmas. After finishing it, I loaned it to my wife, who enjoys historical novels, and she's been reading it avidly every evening before bed. For what it's worth, I understand Hollywood is already planning on making it into a movie. If you liked the novels \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\\" by Susanna Clarke or \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" by Ray Bradbury, you'll probably like this novel. If you enjoyed the movie \\"The Princess Bride\\", you'll probably enjoy this novel. If you like historical novels, alternative histories, or magical fairy tales, you'll probably like this novel.
1936891026|5.0|The War of Art is one of those rare and splendid finds that only comes along every once in a while. I think it took me all of an afternoon to inhale it. With every page turned I became more and more convinced that Steven Pressfield had written it especially for me, though I have no doubt every other reader felt exactly the same way. This book is chockfull of excellent advice for all writers, no matter what stage they are in their journey. A must read if ever there was one.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed this story. I would have given it five stars, but I felt the chapters bout the orphanage were totally unnecessary. In fact, after reading one, I skipped the other chapters set in the orphanage. I got the gist after a few sentences and did not need to read the rest.  Will I read it again? Probably. Will I skip over the same chapters? Definitely.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I'd heard the book had lots of hot sex scenes and I wanted more from the book -- interestingly, both main characters also want &#34;more&#34;.  I found more in the development of their relationship and in each character's personal struggles.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good acting and pretty tense.  Dissappointed to find out it deviated considerably from the real incident.  Probably wouldn't have been as exciting if it followed what really happened
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game<br />Easy to use recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games<br />Plenty of free levels for hours of enjoyment
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|Michael Bolton has always been a favorite of mine. But he truly outdid himself on this collection of Motown hits. His voice lends itself well to the tenor's of Marvin Gaye and Eddie Kendricks. The CD is well worth buying. It took the old standards we grew up with and lent them an air of modern musicality. Great job Michael. I'm purchasing more copies for birthday gifts for my friends who are music aficionado's.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy! Didn't know what yo think about the ending. Would read them all again. Maybe I would pick up on something I missed
B00B2V66VS|5.0|good twists and turns - lots of fun - also, nice that you don't have to follow a story line. Can just pick it up for a few minutes or play for an hour.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Loved the call back to earlier films with the Aston Martin DB5, the music and getting Moneypenny back in the outer office.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game really makes the time go fast.  Before you know it you have been playing this game for hours.  I would recommend this game to my friends.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I do have both series,1 and now the 2nd series. It is a very good family action packed series, not boring fuller of fun for the kids. I also have 1 movie that came out before the legend of the seeker it is called The Seeker. About a young boy going back and forth through time. And at the end he finds  someone?? very good family movie. Full of action. Great to add with the series.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|The memories will haunt us forever. The horrible, gut-wrenching 9-1-1 calls made by trapped victims in the World Trade Center after the planes crashed into them but before the buildings crumbled to the ground. We have forced the recollection to the back of our minds, to the fringe of our consciousness, but they are always there. For nearly all Americans, there is no memory more vivid, no moment more easily recalled, than that fateful September morning.<br /><br />And that is how Zero Dark Thirty, Kathryn Bigelow's gritty and straightforward account of the CIA's hunt for Osama Bin Laden, begins - with the audio of those victims' calls as they vainly waited for help as the building around them burned. The opening jars viewers, unsettling them. It also immediately establishes an emotional connection with the film to the audience .<br /><br />The movie then fast forwards two years, to an undisclosed CIA black site somewhere in the Middle East, where detainees are being interrogated. This is where we meet Maya (played superbly by Jessica Chastain), a new CIA agent whom Washington has deemed \\"a killer\\". At first, Maya timidly joins the enhanced interrogations, mostly watching and taking a backseat as the more grizzled, veteran agent Dan (Jason Clarke).<br /><br />We watch as Dan and Maya discuss strategy on how best to break the detainees and glean valuable intelligence from them. Many tactics are used. Loud metal is played in the detainee's squalid quarters all night long. Prisoners are stripped naked and walked on a leash. They are forced into a small box. Waterboarding is used as prisoners are hooded and gallons of water poured over their face. Other times detainees are rewarded with nice dinners. It is a harsh reality, one that Bigelow looks at unflinchingly, if a bit dramatically.<br /><br />Bit by painstaking bit, Maya and Dan slowly extract information from a variety of sources. While this goes on, the years pass. More terrorist acts occur, some depicted with newscoverage from the actual events. Often, its two steps forward and one step back, as dead end leads are followed to no avail. Dan leaves his foreign post to take a desk job back in Washington. Fellow CIA agents are killed by suicide bombers. A machine gun wielding terrorist attacks Maya as she leaves her protected residential compound in Pakistan one morning for work. Maya soldiers on.<br /><br />Maya's work is largely unrewarding but years of determined, dogged persistence eventually pay off, leading the audience to the now infamous small white compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan where Osama Bin Laden lived in obscurity.<br /><br />When Maya identifies the compound where she believes Bin Laden is hiding, much ado is made of the CIA brass deciding whether or not to proceed with action. While this provides the film with tension and drama, it also painted the intelligence community as reticent, afraid to take action lest it failed in the public's eye.<br /><br />After spending two hours with Maya, the film leaves her behind for most of the last half hour, as the viewer follows SEAL Team Six in the raid that ended with Bin Laden's killing. This conclusion to the movie is nothing less than riveting. From the ride on the stealth helicopters to the storming of the residence, everything depicted seemed refreshingly realistic, unlike too many other Hollywood action sequences that feature superhuman stunts and horrible combat tactics. While I am sure artistic license was taken, nothing was apparently out of place.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain's performance as Maya is remarkable. We see her transform from an almost timorous rookie into a hard-nosed, jaded veteran agent by the end of the film. Don't expect to see where she came from or learn her back story. The movie is as focused as Maya. This approach works, however, because, as I noted earlier, the audience is already emotionally invested in the movie's outcome.<br /><br />Bigelow's direction and Boal's screenwriting combined tomake another gem. Four years ago, they collaborated together on The Hurt Locker which won the coveted Oscar for Best Picture. That year, they probably didn't deserve it. This year, they did deserve the award but were completely snubbed at the Academy Awards. Personally, I believe Chastain, Bigelow and Boal all deserved Oscars.<br /><br />Taking the two movies together, however, I am glad Bigelow and Boal are making films about our involvement in the Middle East. Most movie studios refuse to touch the subject with a ten foot pole, preferring to trot out movies with tired villains and plot lines involving Communists, Nazis or ambiguous European arms dealers. How refreshing it is to view movies that are actually relevant to our times!<br /><br />Of course, the reason the Oscars probably ignored this film (besides an unglamorous tie in sound editing) is because of the inherent political controversies embedded in a story like this. Some are miffed the enhanced interrogation techniques (e.g. waterboarding) weren't shown with medical personnel present, as allegedly all interrogations involving such measures had. Others are upset that the techniques were shown to net positive information for the CIA.<br /><br />I thought the scenes involving these techniques were shown for what they were: Harsh measures that were probably necessary for the occasion. Bigelow did not seem to pass judgment on the interrogation methods either way. She did her best to show them as straightforwardly as possible and let the viewers come to their own conclusions. I believe this was the best possible approach for her to take.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent movie deserving of your thought and attention. It is not light popcorn fare, though that doesn't mean it fails to entertain. It is intimate as it traces Maya's personal story and historic and sweeping in the plot's climax. It's a harsh, realistic story, one that Bigelow honestly tells. Dark, subtle, intimate, epic, magnificent.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I thought it was a little bit boring because it never loaded but that was not the bigest thing it takes forever to get coins but ather then that it is a good game.
0374214913|5.0|Secret societies, mysterious codes, Google hackers, animated anatomy - a delightful mix of wonderful weirdness, stopping just short of the edge between mainstream and science fiction literature (maybe stepping over just a bit). Google doesn't really work the way book presents it, but it would be a lot more amusing if it did!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Great show great cast. Enjoy the interaction between the characters. T V needs more character driven dramas. Love the visuals on this show.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A lot of fun.  It actually let's you win!!  It's a great way to pass the time, very entertaining!  Lot's of fun.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book!! The detail of the story any the characters was amazing. A must read. I am ready for the third one.
B000IZ7YMY|5.0|Men need to see courage in action, plus this is after a cowardly act.  A great story. I use this to encourage others to see how to be what we are supposed to be as a man.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|We really loved this movie. It is a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy. The characters are funny and well remembered. It should go down as a classic. We saw it 3 times already, twice in the theaters and once at home. Heart warming story, teaches you to believe in yourself, friends and magic, enjoy life, to laugh and dream. Dream works does it again, should get top marks, and is the best movie company ever. It deserves an Oscar award! Thank you for this gift of producing this touching movie.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The movie was recommended to me by a friend & I really enjoyed it!  Funny, musical and heartfelt at times too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching the stories of these characters evolve in season 2.  The trials and tribulations of love found and love lost were fun to watch.  The picture quality was amazing.  I am sad that I have finished season 2 and cannot wait for season 3 to become available.
B002C949KE|3.0|Good book but I was expecting more non-intuitive content.  It is very good work that he does but I just felt it could have been better.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Pretty amazing stunts -- just wish they would also consider including some of the laws of physics!<br />Some tings they do are definitely IMPOSSIBLE!
B009VB97EY|1.0|this has to go down as one of the worst movies of all time. Glad I didn't pay $8.00 at the movies--What was the PLOT????
B0026KX6TY|4.0|This is a cute movie worth watching<br />Life is more than just winning at all cost --- (for the kid or for the loser parent!)
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Arrived earlier than expected. Brand new and no problems with any of the discs. I am a huge fan of this show and will probably purchase the 4th season via Amazon due to the deals :)
B0015346OM|5.0|Detailed but easy to read . Raising awareness of a significant episode in the Somalian campaign.  I would thoroughly recommend this book.

B001B3MCQK|5.0|Much of this record's sound will be very familiar to fans of American pop and rock music circa 1970. But the context in which the subversive, indeed prophetic, lyrics found an audience will not. The entire unbelievable tale is captured in the outstanding documentary &#34;Searching for Sugar Man.&#34; It is the one must-see film to come out of the 2013 Academy Awards.<br />Sixto Rodriguez is a songwriter that had much to say about injustice, the powerful and oppression. He displays throughout the album a great deal of comfort singing with any style of backing music. He is a deft musician. And this record ends leaving the listener hungry for more, which, even more unbelievably, was produced. The follow-up album to this one, Coming from Reality, is another fantastic record album.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Being a weather junkie, I use this app almost every day. This is one app that has made it to my favorites list.
B0081336FO|5.0|Love this series.  Really well done.  Love all the characters.  Interesting how they take the themes of the original novels and bring them into current day.
044024613X|4.0|The book is one that is hard to put down and the ending is a surprise one that leaves a book club open to hours of discussion as  perceptions as to what has really taken place will vary.  Discussions regarding nature vs. nurture and genetic predisposition for evil will surface within the conversations for sure.  Parenting and avoidance will also enter in, as will our societal response to those who face such tragic consequences.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I read the whole series. It was an amazing series. And now I'm finished! This was the best book series ever. I'm at a loss for words after this book.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|I carry my Kindle around a lot and the sleeve protects it very well.I am comfortable putting it in my handbag,and I know it is well protected.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore is such an amazing artist!!!! He is the best ever! I highly recommend him to everyone! You won't be disappointed.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was intrigued from the beginning.  I<br />Enjoyed the story line between three people who were facing there there past head on.  Very well written.  Can't wait until the third installment.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|This was a well-acted gripping thriller, but ultimately left me feeling more stressed out than anything else. Denzel was, as usual, impressive and totally believable!
B003ZSISGM|5.0|Going into this book, I was thinking that there was no way I would enjoy it more than the first, having loved the murder-mystery/detective novel aspect of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Although the story is much different, its much more personal to the characters themselves, and this book, in my opinion, is where the real story of the series begins.<br />If you loved the characters of the first book, then this one will not let you down.
B004QX07G4|5.0|The book was downloaded to my kindle quickly.  It was easy to read and had me laughing out loud.  Good book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn sets the scene for a standard murder mystery, and then flips it on its head.  You won't want to root for anyone, but you won't be able to resist rooting for Nick.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book for many reasons. I loved the strength of the main character Katie. She overcomes odds that many women have to live with everyday. I love Alex. He is a dream husband and father and someone that is fun to fantasize about crossing my own path someday. Kevin is scary and realistic and pathetic. The story was so well written. The characters were so real and easy to relate to. This books gives hope in so many different ways. I read it in two nights and now hopefully I can get some sleep. Enjoy. It's a great story.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn weaves a tale of murder and recovery, and avoids cliche by making the protagonist less than likable.  Her attention to the imperfections in humans, and in our perceptions creates interesting, realistic twists.
B007N6EUHI|4.0|I like the detail in the app, only critical point I can make is when you try to select small areas it is difficult. Other that a great App!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I held out on reading this book.  First because it is Young Adult, so I thought I wouldn't find it interesting, and then because it became as big as Twilight, and I was afraid it would be...less than good.<br /><br />But when I saw it available on the Kindle Owner's Lending Library, I thought, &#34;What the heck?&#34;  I was hooked almost instantly.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, for whatever reason, get it now.  It was great!
B005H9B44A|4.0|I like all the Marvel comic movies so far dealing with the Avengers. This is a must see so that you have a greater understanding of the &#34;Avengers&#34; movie itself.
B000QCQ8Y4|2.0|Just too far-fetched. Unrealistic. Boring. Child's is a great writer. Among the best. This book was a great disappointment. I cannot recommend this one.
B003G8Y4QO|1.0|Just feels wrong. The acting is poor, the cimematogrophy doesn't fit and the pace is wrong. This is is first Dr to disappoint me...sniff
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It's a very good fast moving and thrilling movie. One of the good james bond movie. Anyone who has been a friend of bond series will love it.
B000MQPKVG|5.0|This film is probably talked about the least among film fans of Kubrick, but there is not denying this films impact as a great story of tragedy. Just the dueling scenes has the best acting ever captured on film
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is perfect for us. It's not too heavy, has the strap that wraps around, and it's very professional looking.
8862931921|5.0|I love the Moleskine notebooks, I have used most of the other formats.  My only complaint was that they did not have a good desk sized journal.  This is the best desk sized journal I have used.  Pages are the old style and do not bleed or blur my fountain pen ink.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|Seriously the most easy to understand book about why 'social' and 'marketing' matter to your dreams. Filled with salty tales and practical thinking, this is the boot to the head you probably need to survive, and  possibly succeed.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|Anyone who enjoys anime should see this movie. It has much that was later copied by a variety of artists.
B00820N2JG|1.0|This movie was a waste of time watching it. Stopped half way through, couldn't take any more. Not worth the time.
B0067BEB10|5.0|Great songs and the video performance was outstanding. But I never had found where it is for sell. I saw it on my Dish network.
B00AB0NTTI|5.0|Love the old movies. Love Peter Falk. It's along the same lines as Clue, just older. Would watch it again.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I had no idea what 'Fight' would be about but I purchased it because Denzel Washington was the main character and nominee for an academia award. But it was good but I expected a stronger story and Denzel's performance. He has been in several other movies which I considered a 4 or 5 star. I would give it 3 1/2 score. SLH
B0089XH38M|5.0|Easy to download from amazon.com free mobile apps. Nice, works great.  You can scan manually or let it do it's thing.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Again, a true story of a young college graduate who wants to go to Alaska by foot and killing game for food and berries and leaves<br />for nourishment. He meets lots of different people on his journey. He never informed his sister or parents on what and where he<br />was the entire time. Watch the movie to see if he is successful or not.

B0085OELXK|4.0|I remember this movie introducing Matt Damon who has proved movie after movie to be a great actor. I love the story line and his performance along with other cast members.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Mr. Fox seems to emphasize the emotional, and ignore the reality.  The first major oil field in the U.S. was discovered in Titusville, Pa.  to say it was discovered is a stretch, because oil in that geography was literally bubbling out onto the surface of the ground.  With thousands of wells fracked successfully every year, Mr. Fox focuses only on a minority of cases that ignore the overall benefits of a society enabling itself through increasing natural gas production.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Most of the reviews said this was the 'best' James Bond movie.  Over the last 50 years I have seen nearly all of them, with the different Bonds (Connery, Brosnan, Dalton etc.).  I enjoy Daniel Craig but I thought he looked a bit old, hair was very short and his hairline receding, not sexy at all.  The majority of the film took place in dark caverns, underground, train sub stations or in the dark.  It was difficult to follow the action and the story.  Even the one time where Bond is following some one and a gunfight ensures up in the building, the bright advertising in the background, while attempting to 'modernize or high tech' the scene, was distracting and again, the action was in shadows-essentially in the dark.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|A splendid production with an outstanding cast of principalsalong with a fine supporting chorus and orchestra.  The DVD format made it really possible to appreciate fully the fine acting talents of the singers.  Netrebko and Villazon were wonderful!
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Denzel Washington did a good job as the captain, and the actual trouble in the plane with all the sounds, visual effects was overwhelmingly real.  The rest of the movie was somewhat boring and although he was supposed to be a hero for landing the plane in a field with little loss of life, it was unrealistic to believe he wasn't pounced upon by the press at some point.  One cannot hide from that kind of story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have avoided the last 3 or 4 books Grisham has written because of horrible endings on two books in a row. Being fairly caught up on my favorite authors (Grisham used to be one) I decided to give it one more shot. The Racketeer is fun to read and flows well as a page turner. A great story with a twist that was somewhat obvious but still well done. I liked it a lot and look forward more in the future. I may even go back and buy the few I skipped after reading some reviews to be sure they don't have the type endings he had seemed to fall into, that being me wanting to throw the book against the wall.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I understand that they needed a longer running time to go into detail with this story, but did they really have to separate the parts into separate products?  I feel like these movies were rushed and meant to serve as cash cows.  That said, if you have the funds to watch both parts, you should enjoy them.  Part 1 was very gritty and somewhat similar in its premise to the Dark Knight Rises film released around the same time, but in my opinion, Dark Knight Returns is better in every way.<br /><br />[ALERT:  Potential spoilers below!]<br /><br />Basically, Bruce Wayne has retired from being Batman, and it has been ten years since the Batman was last seen.  The Justice League was disbanded a long time ago, around the time Batman retired.  The city of Gotham is just as terrible as ever due to a gang calling themselves The Mutants.  Harvey Dent (2-Face) is let out of a mental hospital only to go missing.  The Joker is seemingly brain-dead, not eating on his own, not talking, not laughing, sitting in the same mental hospital Harvey left.  The Batman returns to find Harvey and save him from his old ways.  The Mutants also get a wake-up call.<br /><br />In my opinion, Dark Knight Returns is much like Batman Beyond, except without all the futuristic gadgets and a new Batman suit.  It is also a lot more gritty than Batman Beyond.  In many ways, Dark Knight Returns is better for being more believable than the films.  Batman doesn't run around with tons of high-tech vehicles, and his suit does not protect him at all.  He doesn't come off as a millionaire.  He uses his wits and combat training to defeat all his villains.  That said, he has a tank, a motorcycle, a glider, smoke pellets, his classic grappling hook, and a few other devices.  He just does not come off as rich as he does in the live action films, because he uses technology sparingly.<br /><br />Overall, part 1 is great and very enjoyable.  However, you will want to see part 2 right after it.  Replay value is somewhat high, because it is always fun to see society's reaction to the Batman making his initial appearance.  It is also fun to see the female Robin make her appearance in animated form.  Part 2 has the Superman scenes, which are much more fun to watch, but the story of part 1 is top notch.high, because it is always fun to see society's reaction to the Batman making his initial appearance.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my Kindle fire. Lots of levels. Fun to play.Me and my grandkids have lots of fun playing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game is simple but just complex enough to keep you playing.  The performance of the game is astounding.  I experienced absolutely no drop in the framerate on my old Android tablet (Coby Kyros MID7015).  I have had this app on that tablet for at least a year and not had any issues with the app.  The Amazon App Store app is a different story, which I will not get into with this review.<br /><br />Anyone who does not know what Angry Birds is about by now needs to look it up on YouTube and watch some gameplay footage.  All the Angry Birds games are the same slingshot catapult physics game.  You are just tossing the &#34;angry birds&#34; into blocks to knock them over.  The game has some other objectives, as well, including collecting tokens and getting the highest score or star rating as possible.  You could play free versions of these Angry Birds games to try them out, but the performance of ad-supported versions is much less refined.  Remember that there is not much innovation involved with each Angry Birds title.  Rio is simply a reskin of a classic game.<br /><br />I give this game a 5/5 because it is simple fun, cheap, and gives me no technical problems.  It runs smoothly and has nice audio and visuals.  It is very easy to play.  It also has that play-on-the-go feel and can easily provide many hours of entertainment during road trips, in the doctor's office, or whatever you do with your tablet.  I highly recommend this game.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game. Love to play this, keeps me entertained and it just keeps going. Very challenging for your brain!
B000PVAFT0|5.0|This is well worth the watch. The images of the undersea life are astonishing, and what's not to like about Johnny Depp's voice drawing you down into the deep???
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is fun to play, reminds me of mario. Wish it had more things to do in the game though.
B00821OX98|4.0|Not the quality of acting as, say, Battlestar Gallactica (the new one), but entertaining enough to watch 3 or 4 episodes in a row. There are a couple characters who grab you, and I'm all about character development so I like that.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This app has good graphics and storyline. Nice to see a well designed app offered as the free app of the day.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I loved the ease with downloading the movie and having the ability to rent or buy the movie.  I chose to rent and felt comfortable with my decision.  The movie was funny, heartwarming and a true love story.
B00BECZPI0|5.0|When my daughter told me to watch a zombie series, I laughed and said \\"No Way!\\"  But she managed to convince me to watch one episode.. and that's all it took.  I was hooked.  It's not a zombie series afterall.  It's about humanity, integrity, society, survival, instincts, love, hate,... and so much more.  I highly recommend it.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|This is a typical Clint Eastwood production.....Good story, tough guy language, macho man image, no outlandish sex scenes.... I would watch it again.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Movie came with closed captioning which is a major plus for me. Felt the acting was superb across the board.
0756686970|5.0|Our 12 year old grandson loved this book.  The photos and info on the characters were great. I have purchased other Lego books for him and he has enjoyed them all. Great gift.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Knife exceeds my expectations except for how dull it was from the factory, it honestly can barely even cut a piece of paper. Have a local joint that specializes in sharpening knives, so that is a non issue. This knife is a beast, can't wait to get a custom holster made for it. Shipping was very fast, and packaged very nicely and securely.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I bought this program for my 3 year old and have discovered that all the kids up to 14 year old love it. It is really easy to use. The only complaint I have is that I have to read the directions every time I want to save a picture. That being said when I have saved more of them I probably will remember how to do it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a way to entertain kids this on is great.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Enjoyed this book slow at first then it picked up when the animals were sold, on the boat then the adventures on the life boat
B007J4T2G8|5.0|No words can describe other than purely amazing.<br />This book offers so many emotions, ones we don't want to admit and ones we thrive to obtain with every turning page.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|It gave me the same feeling as watching 'the Matrix'. Mind-blowing bqd guy, good action scenes, but not unbelievable ones. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A very nice, gritty return to the core of what a Bond movie should be like. Old Dog - New Tricks indeed!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I purchased this for my son for Christmas; we both had a wonderful time watching it.  The characters are hilarious. The craftmanship is excellent, and the storyline engageing.  I would recommend this as an wonderful family movie!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|'Hobbit' is a modest book about a modest quiet creature that unassumingly achieved great things. There is nothing modest about 'Hobbit' the movie. It is a grandiose show that tries to emulate the accomplishment of the book. For some it succeeded, for some it did not. But in my opinion it failed to capture the modest charm of the book and at the same time undoubtedly was successful in separating a lot of people from $12.50 at the movie theater now and another $12.50 x 2 later. So the word 'modest' has been kind of replaced with the word 'shameless'. But you even might shed a tear watching some displays of a 'human-like' spirit - there are no humans in that movie after all yet.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|After viewing the movie in September 2012, I bought 10 copies and send the below letter with a copy of the DVD and the Resolution to each adult member of my extended family.  I recently hosted a showing of the movie at my church and will be conducting the four-week follow-on Courageous Living Bible study this month.<br />\\"Dear Adult Male Family Member,<br />Last month, at the invitation of a parent of a former student, I attended a Men's Night at the Thrive Worship Center (a non-denominational church) in Concord.  It was the best time of male Christian fellowship I had experienced in recent memory.  We had a time of outdoor games, enjoyed manly food (mainly meat, no vegetables, copious quantities of desserts), and then watched the movie \\"Courageous.\\"  I was so moved by the movie that I decided to send a copy of the DVD to each male member of my extended family.  I also intend to show it to the men of Gilwood.<br />Men in America need to step up to the plate and fulfill our obligations as spiritual leaders and role models.  I therefore urge you to take time to watch \\"Courageous\\" in a quiet, undisturbed setting.  Reflect on its message and The Resolution (copy attached) that becomes a central part of the movie.  Resolve to examine your life with a view to adopting as your life's verse:  \\"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\\" - Joshua 24: 15\\"

B001LM1456|2.0|The Incredible Hulk, not to be confused with the movie Hulk, is the first of the individual movies that introduces us to The Avengers, and that's the only reason why I decided to see it, as I never really cared much for the character. I mean think about it, this scientist whose trying to create a super soldier tries the solution on himself, and now when he gets angry he turns into a WWE Superstar! As for the film, it's not much better. I love Edward Norton, he's a big name and a star in his own right, but he's just about the last person I would choose to be the Hulk. His whole personality wasn't right for the part. I like his co-star, Liv Tyler too, and it wasn't that she was bad in this film, it's that her role was a joke and she had absolutely no chemistry with Norton. Tim Roth was the bright spot in the movie, as he's one of those guys who can adapt to any role and I think I'd have preferred to see him as the Hulk. As for the story, parts of it were decent, but they skipped the whole part of the story that I wanted to see! The film starts five years later, in Brazil, I wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this. I hate superheroes and I hate their movies, but the Avengers stories have been different. With the exception of Thor, they have for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable. The story here is lame and the movie is based on special effects which did nothing to help the film. The last half hour of the movie, I felt as though I was watching Peter Griffin fight the Big Chicken and I honestly hated every minute of it!
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|If you're like me and you didn't care for the last two, you probably won't like this one. And that's really all I have to say about this movie. It's not worthy of a full review. Sorry.

B008JFUMUQ|5.0|This is what happens, Bruce Willis, when you don't reprise your role in sequels for years. The younger generation has used Live Free or Die Hard as the standard for which these films are supposed to be living up to, and the older generation expects not only the world out of these films, but has forgotten what they are about. Why has this film gotten bad reviews? Is it because the film was truly bad and unwatchable? Is it because of Bruce Willis's pro-gun views? The latter seems to make the most sense. I mean, Live Free or Die Hard had a ridiculously positive critical reception, given how awful it was. How did this film get panned so badly? This was a great Die Hard movie. My brother agreed it was great too. I have no idea how someone could leave this film not entertained. McClane's humor and personality are back. The ridiculous, over-the-top action is back. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges, but it works.<br /><br />I don't know what more people expect from movies. Rotten Tomatoes wasn't around back in the 80's and early 90's. People generally relied on their local critics and a few magazines, who generally varied in terms of impressions. Now, people base their impressions of a movie on the websites and think that if they disagree, something is wrong with them. Nothing is wrong with questioning the Emperor, people.<br /><br />I go to movies to be entertained, not to find the next Oscar winner. The Academy is giving Ben Affleck awards for Best Picture, and awful actresses like Jennifer Lawrence and Halle Berry awards as well. The critics are panning several decent movies and praising awful ones. Why do people still listen to them?<br /><br />Be entertained. Watch Die Hard 5.

B002UWH8P6|4.0|Never got to see it when it was broadcast, so caught up with it later. The writing and acting were good, but sometimes the plot disturbed me. I won't be adding it to my DVD collection, but it was entertaining to see once.

B0002PZVH0|5.0|At first listen, Brian Eno's Ambient series may seem like nothing more than long loops of repetitive music designed to help insomniacs catch some sleep. In actuality, the gentle, caressing tones of \\"Ambient 1: Music For Airports\\" could probably lull an enraged berserker into a delightful night's slumber, complete with numbered sheep. No insult intended, insomniacs should turn to this piece. It exudes a tranquility unavailable to the senses of most modern urban dwellers. Somehow it manages to focus consciousness into an almost meditative space. As background music, again not intended in any way as an insult, it can occupy that fuzzy level of awareness that often leads one down distracting transgressions of thought and away from the issue at hand. In this way it provides great music for writing. As it occupies that less controlled part of awareness, the immediate senses seem to come more alive.<br /><br />How does it accomplish this near hypnosis? Probably with the slowly pulsating, but actually not repetitive, tape loops that repeat just enough to lull the senses but not enough to cause disinterest. As such, this seemingly simple music contains layers of complexity. And through this it accomplishes amazing feats of music/brain interaction. For those who have experienced this directly, the effect remains unforgettable.<br /><br />So why \\"Music For Airports?\\" The word \\"airport\\" itself summons up deafening noises, almost painful rushed confusion, hustle and anxiety. This music seems to aim at deadening or counteracting those experiences. And Eno apparently dreamed this music up while sitting in a German airport. In a lecture given to the Long Now Foundation in 2003 (still downloadable from their site), Eno eloquently related his thoughts about this album: \\"...what you really need in an airport is the kind of music to make you care less about your own life... that would make you not be so concerned about the prospect of dying... this is true... I want to make the kind of music that would actually reduce your focus on this moment in time that you happen to be in...\\" This very much summarizes the consciousness soothing effect this album creates, not to mention its ability to distract in a strangely pleasant manner.<br /><br />Musicologists often say the best music exists \\"to be listened to,\\" but \\"Music for Airports\\" seems to exist to be experienced along with the moment in time one finds oneself in. Though sparse and unobtrusive, it manages to engage the listener just as much as any other musical experience, though it never overwhelms the way some opera, speed metal or atonal music can. It actually seems to allow more room for the listener's own ego, in contrast to some popular music that seems to drown it with bombastic instrumentation or personality cults. And though it uses mostly dated equipment the sounds somehow still sound fresh decades later. The preceding three Ambient volumes expand on this fascinating, and highly successful, experiment.music that would actually reduce your focus on this moment in time that you happen to be in...\\" This very much summarizes the consciousness soothing effect this album creates, not to mention its ability to distract in a strangely pleasant manner.<br /><br />Musicologists often say the best music exists \\"to be listened to,\\" but \\"Music for Airports\\" seems to exist to be experienced along with the moment in time one finds oneself in.

B00932AA5G|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this film - I watched it with the English subtitles as I don't speak Norwegian. The film is never boring and the action especially picks up when the main character meets the main antagonist. It has a clever plot & dialogue. I'd recommend this movie for people who have good enough taste that they don't mind reading subtitles & can just enjoy the extreme situations the central character gets into.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Very much enjoyed the movie -  Clint does his old foeggy immitation (wait, that him not acting?!?) as an aging baseball scout.  Amy Adams plays the estrainged daughter that takes a break from her high-powered legal life to check on her father.  Justing Timberlake is an up-and-coming scout for another team also scouting the same kid.<br /><br />Mix the three together and you have a wonderful fun story about aging, love and baseball - what else could you ask for?

B005CM9DX6|5.0|Three almost insufferably long years after Opeth released their last life-altering opus, 2008's \\"Watershed,\\" the band return with a surprisingly subdued and docile attitude. And quite possibly the album of the year.<br /><br />As anyone who has been paying the least bit of attention would attest, Mikael Akerfeldt and the gang have always been a brilliant progressive death metal band. But they have been steadily leaning towards progressive music more-and-more with the past couple of releases (starting with 2005's \\"Ghost Reveries,\\" and continuing on with `08's \\"Watershed\\"). And on this, their tenth full-length effort from the studio, 2011's \\"Heritage,\\" Opeth all but extinguish the death metal aspect of their sound. Hence, expect no pummeling blast beats, brutal Slayer riffs, chaotic shred solos, and/or dissonant deathly growls this time around. (And, on that end, there are definitely no black metal-derived shrieks present, here, either.) Yes, there are some sporadic bursts of heaviness, but they are only included to keep the arrangements honest, and prevent them from becoming predictable and/or monotonous.<br /><br />For the most part, though, this 2011 release is a piece of pure progressive rock/metal/music, much in the same vein as Dream Theater, Katatonia, Porcupine Tree, The Swans, and Agalloch. So, on the whole, \\"Heritage\\" is easily the band's most progressive piece to date, aside from 2003's \\"Damnation,\\" of course. (In order of progressiveness, it goes \\"Damnation,\\" \\"Heritage,\\" \\"Blackwater Park.\\")<br /><br />The album begins with the title track, a sad, funeral music-sounding, grand piano-based instrumental that is both hauntingly pretty and darkly grim. This, then, promptly slams into the full-on death-jazz of \\"The Devil's Orchard,\\" though, which is the album's lead single, and has thrashy, careening guitar work, heavy, grumbling bass lines, and jazzy drum fills. The song also features spacey, creepy, atmospheric acoustic guitar work, and also fuses synth textures into the mix -- but, again, what is perhaps most impressive, here, is the bass work, as it is very technical and funky throughout. (Indeed, four stringer Martin Mendez really shows off his dexterity and technical precision, here, by laying down some really rhythmic, stop-start bass riffs.) And a blistering, careening, and shredding guitar solo section is also tucked into the mix near the end of the track.<br /><br />\\"I Feel The Dark\\" opens with the sound of the guitarists each doing their own thing, one with a gorgeous string arrangement, and the other plucking away at a pretty, classical-music-sounding acoustic guitar. \\"Dark\\" is rounded out by a somber backing piano line, a flute (!), droning, gently grumbling bass notes, and fantastically-sweet, angelic-sounding clean vocals from frontman Mikael Akerfeldt. \\"Slither\\" is another sizeable standout, as it boasts some surprisingly aggressive, downtuned guitar and bass crunch, thus ultimately making the song come across sounding like a cross between Cynic, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and Motorhead. Needless to say, it all makes for the record's first really heavy and intense song, and one that is complete with a bit of fiery, thrashy guitar soloing. It ends, however, on a spectacularly pretty note, with a hand-plucked melodic guitar outro.<br /><br />Next up, \\"Nepenthe,\\" is another half-ballad. It begins with a church-sounding organ backing-up a quietly ambient (and nearly silent) acoustic guitar lead, a marching, mid-tempo drum beat, and an accompanying melodic bass line. But, again, this song is only a half-ballad, because it does have occasional bursts of heaviness, with pounding, Meshuggah-style guitar leads, though. Then comes \\"Haxprocess,\\" another breathtakingly beautiful, and delightfully jazzy ballad with stellar crooning and atmospheric, melodic guitar strumming. It also has a gently tapping, syncopated drum beat, and a batch of stellar, and really infectious melodic guitar soloing. And some strong, humming,heavy-yet-simultaneously-melodic bass lines underpin the whole thing.<br /><br />\\"Famine\\" finds some ambient sound effects accompanying a really progressive, deft, and jazzy-sounding tribal /Latin music drum solo (which comes courtesy of guest percussionist Alex Acuna). This is then followed by some mournful piano keys and fabulous, soulful vocals, which, in turn, is followed up by a quick double bass roll, heavy electric guitar riffs, and thundering bass lines. The end result is an epically epic piece with taut dynamics. In fact, it is such a good song that you won't mind at all that it crosses the eight-and-a-half minute mark. The curiously-entitled \\"The Lines In My Hand\\" is similar in that it is so richly diverse. It opens with some technical, deft, funky, and almost Primus-esque slapped bass lines. And the rest of the number is highlighted by a batch of heavy and groovy guitar crunch that is both aggressive and satisfying, Mikael's soaring vocals, and propulsive, jazzy drumming.<br /><br />Then, the listener is dealt one more really complex, and nicely twisted, eight-plus-minute long epic in \\"Folklore.\\" It is filled with complex guitar and bass playing, including excellent, walking, staccato bass lines that again sound reminiscent of Les Claypool. And the tune's funky (and, not to mention, positively catchy) break-beats, and soaring melodic solo are just the icing on an already super-sweet cake. But \\"Heritage\\" wraps up with yet another jazz and folk-music-inspired song in the closing \\"Marrow Of The Earth.\\" It is an instrumental brooder, and one that boasts still more lovely acoustic guitar work (which sounds almost like a keyboard), and darkly ominous, backing organs.<br /><br />When all is said and done, \\"Heritage\\" is most definitely a watershed release. In fact, it would not be weird if it were named \\"Watershed,\\" but alas that title has already been taken for the previous album. All fans should definitely get apart of this \\"Heritage,\\" but newcomers are advised to start with either 1998's \\"My Arms, Your Hearse,\\" or the above-named 2008 release (one of yours truly's favorite metal albums of that year).heavy-yet-simultaneously-melodic bass lines underpin the whole thing.<br /><br />\\"Famine\\" finds some ambient sound effects accompanying a really progressive, deft, and jazzy-sounding tribal /Latin music drum solo (which comes courtesy of guest percussionist Alex Acuna).

B005LAIIHG|3.0|I was interested in Ang Lee's new film \\"Life of Pi\\" not because of the director (though I really like his films especially \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"), but because of the actor in it. Some film fans might remember the name of Irrfan Khan, who played a police inspector interrogating the protagonist of Danny Boyle's \\"Slumdog Millionaire.\\"<br /><br />In this film adaptation of a Booker Prize-winner Yann Martel's novel of the same title, Irrfan Khan plays an adult \\"Pi\\" Patel living in Canada, who is being interviewed by a writer (Rafe Spall replacing Tobey Maguire). In the flashbacks that follow, Pi recounts why he came to called Pi; and how he survived a shipwreck and the subsequent 227 days on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named \\"Richard Parker.\\"<br /><br />People would watch this movie with different expectations. What you get is its beautiful photography by Claudio Miranda (\\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\") and comfortable background score by Mychael Danna. The cast is all very good, including a newcomer Suraj Sharma as young 16-year-old Pi Patel.<br /><br />And there is a story that is beautifully told. While Ang Lee deftly keeps the narrative flowing with rich visuals, however, we are constantly made aware that, well-told as it is, this is just a \\"story.\\" The film's brief third act, where we are asked to choose between two alternatives, makes me feel that even a talented player like Irrfan Khan cannot make the film's brief conclusion concerning power of storytelling (or whatever philosophical theme you might find) convincing or moving.<br /><br />You will be asked: \\"Which do you prefer?\\" I might ask: \\"What if we are not free to choose?\\" The boy's 227-day journey with the tiger is so absorbing that the answer is already made. Even if you don't notice who the \\"Richard Parker\\" is (no, not a comic book character; there are more than one, real-life and fictional), you would most likely to choose the same one as \\"the writer\\" does. As some reviewers have pointed out, the presence of the tiger suggests something more complicated and even sinister, which the film tries to gloss over.<br /><br />I am not saying \\"Life of Pi\\" is not worth watching. There is a good reason why some people say that the film is a triumph of storytelling. Still, I cannot help feeling that some stories are better left to the imagination, especially when those stories should be open to our interpretation.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thank you so much for havng it I could not find it anywhere and I am having a hard time getting any company to connect any cable to my farm area.  The episode was good the character interactions was very interesting and as always things way out of left field to keep us on our toes.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I was really surprised at how easy this scanner was to operate. It is very lightweight, small and set up in seconds. I started out trying negatives. I kept in mind that the negatives had been sitting around (in protective plastic and in their photo folder) for about 13 years. The slides load easily in the side and you manually turn a knob to load them in. I had four on a strip, the minimum is three - less than three and you need to load them individually in the provided folder. When the scanner is turned on, you can see the negatives move into place so that you get it aligned correctly. Hit the scan button and then save them to the SD card (you provide your own memory card). And they are saved!<br /><br />Scanning slides was even easier since you drop the slide into the top slot. You have the option of digitally rotating or flipping them if you have the slide placed incorrectly. Same process, hit scan and then save. The scanner automatically adjusts the picture brightness levels (sometimes to a fault). My slides were high quality but from 1984-1985.<br /><br />Both were very easy to do, changing the settings was easy using the onscreen menus and getting the images to my computer was easy by swapping out the SD memory card.<br /><br />So now for the results. On the little screen, everything looks really great. But once I loaded the images on my computer I noticed a ton of dirt and dust consistently on all the pictures which meant I had introduced it to the inside of the scanner.<br /><br />So I went back, used a little canned air and blew the inside carefully and then blew each slide as I placed it inside. Much better quality. So the key is to keep your work area clean and clean each item or every little piece of dirt, dust or hair will be magnified greatly.<br /><br />Keeping in mind the quality of the camera that took the photos and the amount of time the slides and negatives have been sitting in less than ideal conditions, the quality of the pictures was a little lacking. They were not as crisp as they could have been and there were times that the scanner overexposed things.<br /><br />Since I do graphic design, it was easy enough to go into Photoshop and make some color and brightness corrections but I don't think I want to do that to every photo.<br /><br />However, in defense of the product, it currently costs 29 cents per slide (at Costco.com) to professionally scan and provide a digital file. I have hundreds and hundreds of slides and negatives that could easily cost me in the hundreds of dollars to get converted.<br /><br />So it depends on what you are looking for. If you want a few super high quality scans I would suggest sending them out. If you are looking for control, ease of use, the ability to do them a few or a lot at a time and no hassle scanning, then this is a nice device and very easy to use.<br /><br />I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review.lacking.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|good game but needs more medals and shorter spawn times to be a great game.<br /><br />I would recommend it to some of my friend's in the future.
B0084IHVDO|4.0|This movie did not hold up for me from when I was a kid.  It still is a classic, but different than I remember.  If you are a Disney fan you have to see it!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game, good story line, nice graphics, ran great on my kindle fire hd.  Some of the puzzles are tough, but theres always the hints and an included stategy guide.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is nice to have on the Kindle.  It is a solid app and I use it all the time.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our daughter, who got us all turned-onto Downton in Season 1, American version/season. Season 2 continues the wonderful, at times terrible and tragic, adventures of the gentry 'upstairs' and servants 'down' as life takes them into the flu epidemic and WWI, turning life at Downton upside-down and all manners of sideways. But the trials and tribs of our heroes & heroines only seem to bring out new depths of character confict, and resourcefulness - punctuated by clever repartee and dialogue delivered by tour-de-force actors.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|How do you not like having Facebook on your Kindle.  I think it should be mandatory for everyone.  Makes the day go faster.  good app!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it - but I never use it.  I got it when I was bored and thought I would play with it.  If you have a kid, they will love it.  It is a very cute app.
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|I love Regina Spektor. This album was just as high quality as her other albums, absolutely love the way she sounds. I never have had a bad experience with her albums. She's not reinventing her well tuned wheel!
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Ace of Harps is one of my favorite disks of all time, & I like Ben Harper a lot, but never in a million years would I have dreamed of paring him with Charlie Musselwhite. Shows how much I know. There's a little bit of something for everyone here: some Delta blues, some raw, ragged, straight ahead blues rock (love &#34;I Don't believe&#34; - strong echoes of Led Zeppelin here), even a little gospel, some jazzy/swing stuff, & more, much more. Only critique: would have liked to have heard Charlie on vocals, at least on a couple of songs. But that's a quibble.<br />There are more detailed reviews here that can provide, rather eloquently in some cases, a track by track summary. Those are great, but I'll just provide this as a short, simple encouragement to anyone who sees this disk & is wondering, &#34;hmmm, like me some Ben Harper, but not sure about him with that old guy who I don't know....&#34; GET IT. You won't regret it.
B00B0NDF26|3.0|Catchy songs, but overall the tracks are boring and the same. At least I like the similar style and beats.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Celine in French is completely different, different style different emotions, it comes through who she really is.  Her voice is more mature and better than ever. J'adore ce disque. De ses deux derniers disques francais celuici est beacoup mieux, plus d'emotion et de la maturite.

B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|A full 1/2 of the movie is in the dark. Does being in the dark and strange sounds scare you? This is the movie you have been waiting for. What was that sound? Better go check it out!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love this band. Honestly, I don't think that it's as good as their other album, but you can never go wrong with them!
B00BLGZX5O|2.0|I guess I haven't a good idea what to say other than \\"really?\\"  Too many simple convenient plot turns(equally unbelievable plot turns as it stands) and the level that one must suspend their disbelief is staggering.  The \\"everyone's a follower of the killer\\" seems to only be there as a trap door of sorts to get the adversaries out of one jam to the next.  Ill keep watching but WOW is this show a stretch.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I wish that there were more seasons to watch!  It was disappointing that the fourth season only had 6 episodes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We can't wait until our Downton Abbey Season 3 DVD arrives now!! We watched the entire first DVD in one night! Luv it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids downloaded this, and I became addicted!  There are so many levels, and some of them seem impossible to finish!  Fun/challenging logic game!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|For fans of Downton Abbey, nothing needs to be said. For those who have not yet found it, don't waste time reading a review--WATCH DOWNTON ABBEY! This is one of the finest of Masterpiece Theater's productions ever.
B00493E1GI|3.0|A good story, but a bit long.  We broke it up into two evenings, which worked well.  If only we could all take a year to travel and &#34;find ourselves&#34; !
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My wife and I became hooked on Downton Abby after watching the first two seasons. It is simply one of the best series on TV today.  The upcoming wedding of Matthew and Mary is taking center stage as the season starts.  This season is so dramatic and the storyline so involved that I do not want to spoil any of it for you.  Let's just say that there are several shockers in this season and it will leave you wanting more.<br /><br />Action, tragedy, love and tragedy make this season so involved.  It is not like you are watching a movie or TV series because the characters are so real that you feel that you are living the storyline with them.  This feeling is brought across the screen and into your home because of the excellent cast and the perfect script that just keeps you hanging onto every event.<br /><br />This is television drama at its best and it is so good that it is addicting.  My wife and I think it is the best show on TV and we love watching it.  We rated it a 5 star series and recommend it to you.  It makes me wonder why American TV cannot make shows like this anymore.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  The colors are rich, the voices match the characters, it is believable.  My four year old son totally engages in it.
B004N66XYE|5.0|This is an excellent British television drama that is almost a soap opera style of show.  The show is about an aristocrat Sir Hallam Holland and his wife Lady Agnes moving back into the London home of his father.  Upstairs Downstairs stands for the different life styles and cultures that existed in the home between the servants downstairs and the rich and highly connected owners living upstairs. Eaton Place 165 has a new generation living in the home but the head of the household maid is the same lady who worked in the house when she was a young maid.<br /><br />New staff is hired and some have to be properly trained and they have to get to know each other and learn to work together.  Meanwhile Hallam's mother Maud moves in and there is almost instant friction between Hallam, Lady Agnes and the mother-in-law living in the home.  In addition Lady Agnes' sister moves in and she is a socialist/fascist want-to-be who causes a lot of problems for Hallam and Agnes.<br /><br />This show contains a lot of drama, tension, personal conflict and it all is brought to the surface perfectly by the excellent cast of the show.  The storyline is well done and the writers have done well writing a story that is interesting and fun to watch.  I find it interesting to watch the British interpretation of historical characters like Mrs. Simpson, the woman who married the King, Herr Ribbentrop a Nazi leader working in England and the new King of England when he takes over after his brother abdicates his rank as King to marry Mrs. Simpson.<br /><br />The servants also play a major role in keeping the house running properly but also bringing in their own personal problems into the house.  This first season sets a lot of ground work for the coming season and the building tensions between Germany and the rest of Europe right before WW II.<br /><br />One character who plays a major role in Season One and Two is Persephone who is the sister of Agnes.  She is the sultry, sexy and troublemaking girl whom you will learn to hate.  Her selfish and one sided nature is overwhelming and evil and you will either love her or hate her.<br /><br />This is an excellent show and my wife and I loved it.  We rated it as a 5 star program.rl whom you will learn to hate.

B005DOKIYG|4.0|You get your money's worth out of the zip sleeve. If you're looking for a fancier cover, this isn't it, but it does its job of keeping my Kindle Fire safe and protected when I have it in my backpack or purse. It isn't bulky and it has a convenient carrying handle.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|Very good movie. It arrived fast and in perfect condition. I added this to my collection and I am very happy with my selection
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|do wish it could have ended on a happier note. but i will surely tune in next season to see how they save the story line.
B00000IREA|3.0|She was a fox back then but the movie was not as good as I had remembered it, so there it is.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|after all of the books shirley maclaine has written about her journey in this life and past lives and her choices it was courageous of her daughter sachi parker to write a book about how her mother's choices effected her.  it's an interesting and terrific read about coming to terms with being the daughter of a famous, eccentric mother and a remote, dishonest father.  and coming out a survivor.
B0015F1VY8|4.0|I am a student of British history, so I found this story very compelling. The acting was outstanding, although the resolution of the storyline was a bit unsatisfying. Gorgeous period costumes...vibrant historically accurate scenery. The violence and sex are very appropriate for the time period. Not an era for the faint of heart. I would recommend this to historical buffs or Cate Blanchett fans.
0786955570|5.0|This game is great and I'm sure a person could play it by themselves. But I ran a few adventures for a group and acted as the DM instead of playing a character. This way I could keep most of the mechanics of the games a secret and let the game have more of a true D&D feel, it worked great.<br /><br />Contents of the box seem fairly high quality. Figures aren't painted just molded with one color. The card stock is the typical stuff and will hold up well.<br /><br />It is an incredibly easy game to learn and far easier to learn than most card games. The instructions are easy to read and quick to reference. I bought it at my local hobby shop for $65.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My friends and I saw this movie in theaters and we all laughed so hard.  We loved it.  So I bought it when it came out.  My husband was skeptical to watch it thinking it was another chick flick that I was making him watch.  He loved it!  We even watched it again a few nights later.  Just a funny movie!

B003EV6DBW|5.0|Having witnessed how awesome a Doctor Matt Smith makes after watching the 2nd half of series 6, I decided to start from his beginning (although to be honest, it was the only set of the new series in my price range).  But thank you Amazon, for putting this on sale.  It was one of the best $20 I've ever spent in my whole life.  This season is just excellent, for the most part.  Here's a review of each episode:<br /><br />The Eleventh Hour:  The newly regenerated Doctor has 20 minutes to save the world and only Amy Pond can help him. If you can get past the overly long & very stupid scene where he tries food, this episode is awesome.  It's worth it just for the scene where The Doctor confronts the Atraxi.  A<br /><br />The Beast Below:  The Doctor Takes Amy to a distant future, where she finds all of Britain in a giant spaceship.  This is the sort of story I became to expect toward the end of series 6.  It's a very interesting one-off story with a great ending.  A<br /><br />Victory of the Daleks:  The Doctor is summoned to blitz torn London by Winston Churchill - and the Daleks are waiting for him!  This is something of a miss.  For the most part it's good, but the Daleks escaping at the end sort of ruins it.  B-<br /><br />The Time of Angels:  Don't blink - the Doctor hunts the last of the Weeping Angels through the terrifying Maze of the Dead.  I had not seen Blink before I saw this episode, but that didn't keep me from finding it excellent.  A+<br /><br />Flesh and Stone:  Surrounded by an army of Weeping Angels, the Doctor & his friends must escape through the forest.  This is another excellent episode, making this one of the greatest 2 part stories in the new show.<br />A+<br /><br />Vampires of Venice: Dessicated corpses and terror in the canals - the Doctor takes Amy and Rory to 17th Century Venice.  This is a great episode with one of the best monsters of the week and some very funny moments.  A<br /><br />Amy's Choice:  It's been 5 years since Amy saw the Doctor, and when he reappears, she faces a terrible choice.  This is an incredibly good episode that keeps you guessing.  A+<br /><br />The Hungry Earth:  The most ambitious drilling project ever reaches far below the Earth's crust - but the ground is fighting back.  The nadir of the season, perhaps even of the whole new series.  Everyone acted stupidly.  Seriously, I can't think of any single episode worse than this one.  F<br /><br />Cold Blood:  The Earth faces the dawn of a new age of harmony, or the start of its final war.  It's more of the same idiotic writing as the first.  The ending, or rather everything from when the crack showed up, was excellent but that does not make up for the preachy & stupid story.  This is by far the worst 2 part episode in the new show.  D<br /><br />Vincent & the Doctor:  The Doctor & Amy Pond meet Vincent Van Gogh, and help him fight a monster.  Aside from how they suddenly felt sad when the beast died, this was an excellent episode.  A<br /><br />The Lodger:  The Doctor must solve the mystery of the staircase that people go up, but never down.  This episode was a disappointment to me.  I loved the second episode with Craig, & thought the first one would be as good.  There's far too much stalling and not enough good comedy, but the central idea was good.  C-<br /><br />The Pandorica Opens: The Doctor's friends unite to send him a terrible warning - the Pandorica is opening.  Only one word can describe this episode: epic.  Everything from this season really came together.  This also had one of the top 10 most suspenseful cliffhangers in Doctor Who ever.  A+<br /><br />Big Bang: The last hope for all reality is a little girl who still believes in stars...  The series finale continues to rock.  This is the best 2 part story I've seen of the whole series so far, & this part is the best one of the season.  A+<br /><br />So, it came to basically 2 dollars for every outstanding episode (9), and 2 dollars extra for the special features.  Definitely a great deal.  Matt Smith is definitely one of my top 3 Doctors (along with Tom Baker & David Tennant) and this was a great season, even if there were a few duds.  I look forward to seeing the rest of series 6 & series 7.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|OMG this book was so beautiful I almost cried at the end it was so beautiful I loved and I can't wait to read the sequel.

B000JMKNV0|1.0|i couldnt continue reading a book where the characters are so thinly drawn and the horror like dark atmosphere seems to be leading to an inevitably bad conclusion.The style seems like Steven King --without the humor-- and so had been done over and over already.Altho the movie by scorcese,based on the book was not great,in this case i wold recommend it over the book which i basically found unreadable.
0316067938|5.0|My favorite book by a long shot!  This book keeps you on your toes!  Love the entire saga.  I highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very addictive and fun to play the updates keep it fresh and entertaining. By far one of my favorite apps
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I gave it 2 stars because, it had some words that I would have liked to know the definition of, but it didn't have them, so it was a bit of a letdown. All in all it is a handy dictionary to have around.
B008220C38|5.0|What a great story. I must read the book.  When the movie is this good you know the book has to be amazing. Books are always better.  This is my new favorite movie.

1582701709|5.0|This book tells you things you already know but probably don't do on a regular basis.  It reiterates the importance of positive thinking, which I feel everyone should do.  Negativitiy does nothing but breed negative thoughts, which doesn't help anyone.  I highly recommend this book if you want to turn your thoughts to positive ones.
B008220DIC|2.0|Maybe I just didn't get the point, but I sat through this entire film and not once did I ever get an inkling as to what exactly it was about.  Perhaps that IS the point, but it didn't make it any more enjoyable.  The leads are flawless as is the cinematography, but this appears to be little more than an oddball character study.  I like most of Anderson's work, so I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I didn't enjoy this one.

B00A3NQNUU|2.0|The kids love it. However, they spent $35 on piles and bags of cash before we stopped them. They didn't realize they were charging our credit card for each of these items. BS scam on little kids. Lame.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Let me first say, that all of these actors are strong. The characters they portray are deep, insightful, and refined (in the acting sense).....however....<br /><br />There is no cohesion to this story whatsoever. I understand what the movie is meant to be, and say, and leave to the imagination, but it's just not a pleasant ride to get there.<br />There is no benefit for the audience to know what the characters do or do not discover within themselves.<br /><br />This movie failed to realize what it was trying to say..... I really did give it all the way until the end, waiting for 'Aha!', but honestly, it was only a yawn<br />Sorry, not feelin it
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Typical Hollywood time travel movie.  Predictable.  Too much foul language that detracts from the dialogue and plot. Only redeeming part is the performance of the little boy as Sid. He definitely has a future in acting!

B005IQZB14|2.0|This book reminds me of Eat, Pray, Love, another book about a selfish woman who is less of hero and more of a lost soul trying indulging in selfish whims.  I'll admit that the actual writing of this book isn't that bad, but I had to put it down half-way through because I could not get myself to care at all about the protagonist, a woman who doesn't mind screwing people over and being selfish because somehow she justifies it with the I-have-issues excuse.  I am dying to read more books that have strong female role models and not these types of self-indulgent females who create all of their own problems and then \\"struggle\\" to fix them.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fast, fun and full of exciting missions.  I enjoy the graphics, the music, the movement.  It has become the latest addiction in this household as we all compete for the high score.  We use it on our Kindle Fire as well as our Android phones.

B004G6009K|5.0|Tangled is a delightful animated feature. It is beautiful and fun, has a lot of family-appropriate humor and delightful animal characters. It still has the dark characters and elements of Sleeping Beauty and other fairy tales, but it manages to convey the darkness and danger without terrifying young viewers. If you like Disney's classic animated features, you will enjoy this one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game, great graphics, lots of challenges and BIG MONKEYS!  This game has it all!  Run for your life and have a blast doing it with this game.  Occasionally it lags on our Kindle Fire and that's the only drawback.  I don't think it's our wireless, because we just upgraded and we don't see these lags with other fast paced games.  But, overall - still full of fun and excitement!
1402790546|5.0|Len Deighton's novel, the first done on a word processor, is a masterpiece...it functions as both a snapshot of the RAF's bomber war over Germany, and as a bitter condemnation of war.<br /><br />First, it dissects both sides of the bomber war with intense detail, both technical and human, by giving the full picture of a single \\"typical\\" night in the bombing of Germany (albeit a fictional one, June 31, 1943). We see the reality of the bomber war from both sides, British and German, ranging across the full spectrum, from planning to preparation to take-off, to outward flight. Then we see German defense mustered against the RAF, both military and civil. The two sides' operations are intertwined, and we see the stark heroism of the RAF crews trying to reach their targets and deliver the biggest punch, and that of the German defenders trying to protect their nation. Both sides are rendered with great technical knowledge, skill, and humanity. These are people we know, have met, and can relate to. They could be our grandfathers and grandmothers, living, suffering, and dying through mankind's greatest calamity. A reader who goes through this book will know what it was like to fly a Lancaster or a Ju 88 night-fighter, to man a radar station, to sit in a cellar under the bombing, to dig out a blasted house, to fight fires in a blazing town, and survive it all.<br /><br />At the same time, this book is a bitter and harsh condemnation of war and everything connected with it. Everything that can go wrong on this raid, does. The RAF hits the wrong target, a small town instead of a large city. The RAF Group Captain mistakes a pilot whose plane is named \\"Joe for King\\" with another one who doesn't want to play on his cricket team, and busts the latter for \\"lacking moral fiber.\\" A German lieutenant asks his maid to marry him, and she says yes, only to get a rude surprise. Another German pilot discovers the horrific truth about Nazi \\"science.\\" The town Burgomaster's party goes horribly wrong. The list and catalogue of personal disasters just goes on and on, rich with irony, as a whole world disintegrates for all the characters involved. The insanity and madness of war is revealed in a cool, understated, tone, without histrionics, but with great restraint.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.y wrong.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|My fout year old daughter does not sit still for anything and she sat to watch the entire movie. My one and a halfvyear old also really enjoyed the music.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Amazon should categorize books which are Young Adult.  It's not what I prefer.<br />The character's were cute, but not very deep.  The plot is not very original, but entertaining.<br />Transition from one activity to the next was abrupt, and sometimes did not make sense.<br />The praise from others compared this work to George RR Martin and Tolkein - DEFINITELY NOT.<br />The book is very short - double spacing does not make it longer, it is just annoying to have to &#34;turn&#34; the pages more often.<br />While I'd like to see what happens to the characters, I don't believe that I'll buy then next one.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Academy award winner for sure.  Action packed, realistic, great acting and choices for characters perfect.  A definite must see movie.
B00BESM14U|5.0|What a beautiful movie full of moments of youth, free spirits and love. It also brought me to tears. A really great film.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|A comedy that made me laugh throughout the movie. Pretty funny and a movie that can be watched again and still get laughs. Would definitely recommend!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Great special effects and cinematography; it just went on way too long. I'm more interested in a good story than continuous explosions and pyrotechnics.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It starts out great but you soon realize there is really nothing to do. Load game, collect coins & such, hatch a baby. That's about it. One click repetitive actions.
B00B2QA646|2.0|While the movie had some amazing eye candy...not really the people but the scenery and the sets, its content seemed too rushed and not really developed. No time or content to really form an emotional bond with any of the characters...I could have cared less what happened to any of the characters in this adaptation of Anna Kerenina. This movie could have really been amazing...especially with its cast.  But in the end, it just left me wanting...
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Does exactly what is says it will do. This makes things much easier when it comes to playing Minecraft. Love it!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is an upbeat book in spite of its realistic view of mental illness. I found myself rooting for the characters from beginning to end.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  Hard to get into at first but definately worth the read!
B00969PR18|4.0|I love it so much I cant stop using it this app helps me out a lot I hope you like it too
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Great combination of guitars and synthesizers makes for an absolutely jammin OST.  Don't be fooled by the [* Mix] labels, this isn't a remix album-- the tracks are just referred to that way because they're the various parts of the polyphonic music that plays in-game put together.
0061914177|5.0|Crush It was one of the most inspirational books that I have every read as it relates to building a dream.  Gary explains how to actually build a career that you are passionate about. In a day where a lot of people have resolved to simply take what life has given, Gary explains that you have a choice of living a life of quite resignation or you can take your passion and build your dreams.  Gary explains how the internet and social media has created an opportunity for anyone that is willing to work hard to be able to build a business around their passions. This book is a must read for anyone that has had that dream of building a business that they could be passionate about but wasn't sure just how it was possible.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show. Great acting, the storyline is intriguing, and the scenic backdrop of England is beautiful. I can hardly wait to finish the entire series.
0452289963|5.0|i love this book, this and The Power of Now are my favorites. i really like eckhart tolle's teachings and spirituality. here he teaches a lot of awesome yet simple things.<br />book material is nice, its kinda durable. i lasted like 6 month with it and it was in nice condition. them i gave it away to a friend.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|very good keeps you in suspense and can't wait to get to the next scene, even though you kind of know what the end is.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have been watching this via recording and usually end up watching three episodes (3 hours) at a time.  The plot, characters and history are all compelling and well done.  Great show and quite addictive!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|not as entertaining as expected, very slow and not too much to keep you interested. not too good would not recommend
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Used this twice and had nothing but success with it on my computer and a friends machine.  It is a bit messy so it should definitely be applied at the last step.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|great Southern country/rock especially the first 5 or 6 tracks were great to me. It reminded me of the &#34;Outlaw&#34; days.
1585104205|4.0|This book takes an interesting approach to learning Latin.  I am currently in a Latin class and one of my biggest challenges is internalizing the vast vocabulary.  Even some of the common words escape me.  This book helps with that because you start noticing patterns and reading for the meaning rather than the translation.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the app a lot I just wish it was downloadable so internet access wasn't necessary for it to work.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The art work for the dragons is cute and the sounds are too.<br />It takes a little while to get things rolling if you are not willing to purchase in game credit but the game is enjoyable.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Great storyline, very suspenseful.  Feels like it is pretty realistic.  Has a little bit of a &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; feel, but I think these actors pull it off.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Realistic and informative as well as a really good story line<br />Ben has done a great job with this one and it's well worth the awards
0811875555|5.0|The Art of Tangled its a must if you like animation.<br />Its has a lot of hand draw sketches that are great and lots of info.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Others have said that Wool is destined to become a classic. I beg to differ. I think it was a classic as soon as it went to press. The things that make a classic are a brilliant and unique writing style, a unique concept, characters that draw you in and illuminating an aspect of humanity that is rarely, if ever, revealed. Wool does all of that.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Thoroughly presented idea which has for a long time been ignored I'm very impressed with the author's background and manner of speaking.  She is very convincing.  Enjoyed her many examples of well known people and how introversion affected them.
B0024RI72U|5.0|This concept album truly deserves a 5 star rating. The entire album flows through as a whole and the storyline gets deeper throughout. The songs are very nostalgic, as I often find myself coming back to them. I'd highly recommend this to both experienced BG listeners or ones who are just getting into the band itself.
1449410243|4.0|The book is hilarious (what else would you expect of he Oatmeal?) but isn't the kind of book you feel the need to hang on to after your read it...and you can read the entire thing in about an hour. The poster which is included adds to the value, but, like the book, quickly looses its relevance. This would seem the perfect book for a junior-high or high-school library if the language wasn't a bit too obscene for some parents. Overall, I think it makes a better witty gift than an addition to your personal library.
