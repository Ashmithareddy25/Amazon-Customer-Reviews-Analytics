B008KNUKVI|5.0|I just discovered Pentatonix a few weeks ago, and I am absolutely in love. This album is so lovely, although it is mostly covers. They make the songs their own, for instance, they breathed completely new life into the overplayed Somebody That I Used To Know.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Utopian literature is often used to jolt us out of complacency, taking the premise that what YOU think is a perfect world might well be HELL ON EARTH to the person sitting next to you (or the person to whom you're married). And since there is no perfection on earth, we always view Utopian lit as fairy tale, fantasy, sci-fi, not real.  In Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn poses a question about the perfect marriage (What happens to the people in a marriage in which all the ideal ingredients are perfectly present?) and illustrates the answer with a clarity (and yes, reality) like you've never read before!!  Known for her psychological thrillers, Gillian Flynn takes the genre a step above that stereotype in Gone Girl.  What would a perfect marriage be like?  Like the marriage of Nick and Amy, two beautiful people who love each other madly, who know each other intimately, and who complete each other perfectly.  Without revealing the ending--they do!  The maddening thing about this novel is that you can't discuss it with anyone who hasn't read it--it would spoil the book for the un-read.  So, get your copy ASAP so you can discuss it with those friends who keep asking, \\"Have you read it yet?\\" My friends are certainly glad I've finished it.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I had to watch this in an ethics class. I think this is great for anyone to watch, it is very informative and interesting to say the least.
B003CSV7TK|1.0|Part way through the movie the sound stops working, tried everything on the TV first and switched TVs but still does not work.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Not only is her voice so unique and beautiful, the songwriting on this album is nothing short of superb. Usually I don't like entire albums, but this is one of the rarities for sure, from beginning to end this album is awesome.

B005RUV0NY|5.0|TWD is awesome. best show on tv. it's great to be able to watch it in HD on my computer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I wanted to read the story before watching the movie and it is amazing. Katniss retains her aloof personality throughout the novel, even as the danger increases around her. Overall, it was very well written and kept me intrigued from start to finish. The cutthroat society isn't very far-fetched and I wanted to know all the details, no matter how crazy it seemed to become.
B00A6I87UQ|4.0|This is another atlas but it has several advantages.<br />a. Is portable<br />b. It has selected objects which are more interesting for the amateur<br />c. the charts are very well designed<br />e.  It is made by Sky & Telescope Publications (my favorite astronomy magazine).<br /><br />But,<br /><br />The image definition of the cart when you make zoom in the iPad screen is not good. That is disappointing.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I live in California and ordered the vinyl box set 10 days ago with 2 day delivery. Amazon delivered the set on time by UPS and the packaging was exceptional as stated in other reviews. The LP records were factory wrapped in plastic as was the extremely stout hinged container. I unwrapped the set and checked each record disc for marks and distortion, finding none. They are flat and all labels properly centered. The history book is a real plus!<br /><br />I have played every record on both sides and the sound is outstanding. They are very robust platters from PARLOPHONE and the fidelity is excellent with nothing but silence between tracks. I'm unsure where they were manufactured but the jackets do say E. M. I. RECORDS;  Hayes, Middlesex, England. I cannot explain the complaints. Perhaps E.M.I. has selected a better supplier.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is such an amazing book.  I could not put it down!!!  Five stars are really not enough!  Hopeless made me laugh out loud, cry, and loose sleep...it's great.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game that I go to time and time again when I have a few minutes to kill.<br /><br />I thought about knocking off a star because my phone was randomly locking up until I turned off the notifications in the game,  but it is just as likely my buggy Motorola photon.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The installation was a little bit tricky but there is no doubt that this thing works as advertised.

B005NFJAXU|5.0|I picked up this show blindly after so many people had recommended it to me. It is worth the money. A fun show, but a little slow starting.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have no complaints works like it should.  The new version is easier to use and makes deleting emails quicker.
B008F9E306|4.0|Many feel that TI lost his vibe quite a bit with [[ASIN:B003RDPYEO No Mercy]]. That can arguably be an honest discussion. But with No Mercy, TI was in a totatlly different place than he is now (due to his actions of course). Now he is a little more free with less restrictions and it definitely shows in this album. If you are a diehard fan, than you will realize that with Trouble Man, there is the reintroduction of TIP. This isn't TI, but T.I.P.<br /><br />I like the collaborations on this album. Ceelo can do almost no wrong for me musicality wise. I think people are forgetting his background in the music industry, but it was cool seeing what a collabo between the two of these individuals would turn out like in the song Hello.<br /><br />Guns and Roses. Can I say wow at this song? The collaboration between TI and Pink seems unheard of, maybe impossible, but it works. TI takes a lot of risks with this album, but with solid lyrics and beats, and unique but relevant features like A$AP Rocky, Ceelo Green, P!nk, R Kelly and Akon, this is a return of a man many were waiting for.

1400052181|1.0|What should have been a great story about astonishing scientific advances and the poverty-stricken family that made those advances possible was ruined for this reader by the author's narcissism, a topic she would do well to research next.  Rebecca Skloot is a talented writer in need of an honest editor, one who will look Rebecca in the eye and ask \\"Is this a story about Henrietta Lacks or one about Rebecca Skloot, the intrepid, compassionate, and dogged journalist?\\"<br /><br />The dedication is an eye-roller (she doesn't say she missed interacting with family members while working on the book but she's darn sure they must have missed interacting with her, poor dears).  The ponderous acknowledgements, which run a full seven (7!) pages after an introductory statement in which she regrets that space will not permit her to thank everyone who helped her, read like one of those horribly long Oscar speeches that have the audience squirming in their seats.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the Afterword, the final chapter, where Skloot stops writing about herself and addresses some bioethical issues related to human tissue research.  She never confronts the potential costs associated with establishing the sorts of systems that have been suggested but that's not surprising since one does not get the sense financial realism is a topic of interest to her.  After all, as she mentions several times in the book, she used student loans and credit cards to fund her research on Henrietta Lacks.<br /><br />This could have been such a great book.  What a shame Skloot was unable to set aside her own ego long enough to tell us about Henrietta Lacks, her family, and her cells.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|I loved this 25th Anniversary edition of Micheal Jackson's Thriller. It includes interviews with Quincy Jones, Vincent Price, etc others involved in making of this legendary album. Many of his biggest hits are on it. It has some raw demo footage of songs as they were in the production phase. Micheal is talking ..singing acapella.  They have all of the songs from the original Thriller plus a few that were not included on original album. I am so thrilled to have this as part of my CD collection. No Cd collection is complete without it. It is a must have so get it asap!

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I have really been enjoying this game. I just wish there was ANY way in game to earn more gems, like trading bits or shards. I have way too many laughter shards and there is only one thing to spend those on in game - destroying parasprites - and those are rare.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|The PlayStation Vita is a great system, but it really needed a solid RPG.  Well, we finally have one!  I've played Persona 1 and 3, so the series isn't new to me.  Much like the previous entries, you're playing as a group of high school kids who're trying to combat an evil presence in your hometown.  As many people say, the game is an RPG with some sort of \\"Sims\\" elements.  I've never played The Sims, but I think I can see where they're coming from.  You need to balance your in-game life.  You can do whatever you'd like after school and at night.  Whether it be dungeon-crawling in the afternoon and sleep at night, or socializing then work.  But if you don't strike some sort of balance, then it's Game Over.  Now let's get into some impressions that I have about this game...<br /><br />Sound and Graphics:<br />The graphics are cell-shaded anime style, and are quite fluid.  The style fits the game perfectly.  The music, much like the rest of the titles in the series, is made up of catchy J-pop'ish tunes.  I really like what they've done here!<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The controls are pretty standard.  I haven't had any real issues with figuring anything out (no manual was needed.)  The social-life aspect, as well as the fusion of personae keeps things interesting.  There is no \\"best\\" way to play the game.  You'll likely find a way that suits your tastes, and it'll likely be different from other players.  Over all, I really like the mechanics of the game.<br /><br />Characters and Story:<br />I find that characters in many JRPG's can be very annoying and over-the-top.  Not so much the case here.  Each character was well-written, and the voice acting is well-done.  (They also have an option to turn off the voices during gameplay.  With this feature enabled, you only have to listen to them during the cut-scenes.)  The storyline is quite good, in my opinion.  They have this whole mysterious murder thing going on, and you are hellbent on figuring out what's going on; quite original, from my experiences.<br /><br />Ultimately, I couldn't recommend this game more if I wanted to.  The awesome story with good characters, great graphics and music, intuitive play controls and an interesting mix between RPG and life-simulation make for a winning combination. Any Vita owner who is looking for a solid RPG should check this game out!  Hell, I'm sad that I missed it on the PS2!  :(original, from my experiences.<br /><br />Ultimately, I couldn't recommend this game more if I wanted to.

0547884591|5.0|This is the book I've been looking for for five years.  Ferris's simple method for learning anything is incredibly effective and the book is beautiful too.  I love the pictures and use of color.
B009YU62H2|4.0|I purchased the MP3 from Amazon for the low price of 3.99 , otherwise I might have taken a pass.<br /> Never was a huge fan of this band even though I always liked them, especially Superunknown.<br /> But I was surprised about how good this one is, not that I expected it to stink but there are some really good tunes here, Chris Cornell still sounds great and there is lots of excellent guitar playing also.<br /> Any fan of Soundgarden should like this, and for 3.99 you can't go wrong.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Pretty typical for a follett novel.  Great story, but maybe a few too many steamy sex scenes.  Very enjoyable read.

B00A17AD36|5.0|I love this album. It is sexy and soulful. I can listen to it all the way through and replay it. His style is original, his lyrics are raw and the melodies are easy to fall into. This is my new favorite album. Very R&B
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|So far I've tried this on Snapple bottles and about 1/5 actually fractured anywhere near the score line.  Either Snapple bottles are no good, or this method of bottle cutting is just a crap shoot no matter how you do it.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Not much I can say, the music is great, many really good songs on one disc unlike many other artists that release.<br />Yay good music!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie starts out like its a lame children's Christmas Story but then it takes off and is as funny as can be.  You have to appreciate coarse humor and jokes about drug use...if you don't think a pot smoking Teddy Bear is funny, you should probably pass on this but this is one of Seth McFarland's comedic masterpieces.  I never laughed so hard in my life!
0545265355|5.0|Being an avid follower of Birdy, I undoubtedly ran into the fact that The Hunger Games is her favorite trilogy. I decided to pick up the 1st book... when I finished it, I found that I had been reading, not because of prior hype or trying to stay with pop culture, but because it's extremely addictive, very well written, and kept me on the edge of (whatever I was sitting on) the ENTIRE TIME... once I finished the first book, I knew I was a gonner... I bought the box set.<br /><br />Suprisingly, before Birdy's words, I hadn't given even the SLIGHTEST BIT of attention to The Hunger Games. I thought it was another imitation \\"Twilight\\" girly-fling. I literally judged a book - not even by its own - but by ANOTHER book's renown! My point - don't make the same irrational mistake I did.<br /><br />It's true that this book is popular among the ladies so, yes, it does contain paragraphs drenched in sappy teenage love - but each are equally weighed by intense, barely-escaping-death moments!... And not even that the sappy love stuff is deterring. Our female protagonist, Katniss is rather against it herself, and is more pushed into a relationship than choosing it... but I'm not here to talk details, or ramble on about the plot, I'm just reassuring you fine folks that Bella and Edward are not in these books.<br /><br />My favorite thing about The Hunger Games is that several of its concepts hit home - Life and death. Family and friends. Home lol. Starvation. War. And most eminently, having the courage to stand up for what's right... Collins makes you feel everything down to the last lurid step... but among all of the reality, it doesn't stop this book from being purely innovative - while the setting is very imaginable, it's still fantasy. And nothing like I've ever had the pleasure of reading about.<br /><br />- Cameron
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I believe that it runs slow. I also wish it would give you coins faster. I am not a big fan of paying for them. Other wise I am very into this game.
B0010OIN90|5.0|producto muy bueno. De excelente calidad. Me gusta desde que lo vi por primera vez.. good. producto bueno y de buena marca.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This thing is a bit bigger than I had thought, and definitely heavier, but it'll last many lifetimes.  The blade comes already sharp, which some knives in this price range do not, and it is difficult to dull while being easy to sharpen.  The stock fits my hand quite well and feels very natural from the minute that I picked it up.  The sheath is a good quality synthetic that has a strap that snaps to hold it in place, but it also snaps into the sheath, so except under extreme conditions you could probably carry it without ever snapping it and not lose it.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The alarm works great with many sounds (Kindle Fire 7 HD ). Sometimes it says \\"alarm has stopped\\". To eliminate the message; delete the alarm for weekly or daily, instead manually set each time and delete it off after each use.<br /><br />Best use would be like sleeping in the car at work or traveling (snooze's or siesta's). At home use would require you to use your UBS port as not to run down battery.<br /><br />The message can be annoying to some, but shows up only after it hibernates.
159413586X|3.0|The first book was a very entertaining amalgum of Running Man/The Lottery for the ever growing tween young adult consumer.  The second was a slightly rushed follow up that tried to expand the significance and political themes.  The third bordered on ridiculousness.  Had I not the type of personality that needs to stick with a story to the end I would've just quit after about a third of the way into this finale.  It feels like a thread that has been stretched so thin from the original story that it's ready to snap.  The very ending is also rushed with very few resolving details.  The final chapter and epilogue are so very (unintentionally and unartistically) vague.  It's almost as if a page limit was reached and Collins and her publisher just threw something together to appease readers about what happens after the \\"climax\\".  If you haven't started reading these yet, or you've only read The Hunger Games, stop while you're ahead.  You'll be better off.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|A sort of silly, fun retro space invaders. Took a little getting used to but it's definitely worth a dollar.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book a lot. I've read nearly all of Stephen King's books and this one was really great. A few shout outs for the Kingverse fans but overall pretty self contained. I found it a riveting read, a real page turner!
0525478817|5.0|This is a great, emotional read that I enjoyed, even as an adult.  Often young adult books are either a) not well written or b) painfully young and annoying.  Obviously being young is a part of the \\"young adult\\" novel, but there's a difference between a paint-by-numbers version and a well thought out, beautifully written young adult book.  This one definitely falls in the latter category.  The characters were enjoyable and the plot was interesting and kept my interest.  Be prepared for an emotional read, but one that you will enjoy, no matter your age.
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|I have not read the whole book but thought it was ok just not interesting enough to finish the whole book.
0307744434|5.0|Disclaimer:  I love supernatural, fantasy type books and love to get caught up in the worlds created by the authors.  However, a lot of these books aren't great and end up being a so-so read.<br /><br />This is not a so-so book.  I loved the circus world created by the author and the mystery surrounding the circus and some of the characters.  I enjoyed the laying of the groundwork (even though it took awhile to fully understand what was going on) and then the slow progression of the story.  Don't read \\"slow\\" as in \\"this book is hard to get through.\\"  This book moves quickly and is a fascinating read that builds to a great climax.  I enjoyed the characters, the main ones and the more minor supporting ones.  Many of the characters have mysterious backgrounds or a mystery present, but the reveal is worth it.  Keep reading:)
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I think I would get very tired playing the same thing over and over.  I would like some thing more taxing to my brain.
030758836X|4.0|I was captured by this book from the first page to the end.  It is a fascinating, fast-paced book that draws you in with the characters and the plot.  Many of the characters are horrible, detestable people, who probably have serious mental issues, but that doesn't take away from the interest in them.  As I read, I constantly wanted to know what was happening next.  Each chapter ended with a mini-cliffhanger that kept me reading late into the night.<br /><br />Be prepared for some characters you will hate, some plot points that will annoy you, and some adult language/scenes, but all of this contributes to a great read.<br /><br />A great book club book!  My book club read it and we had a great discussion!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Any fan of Michael's would LOVE this boxed set; remastered originals, free posters and stickers, nice booklet, a whole disk of unreleased songs -- and the pinnacle of it all -- a DVD of Michael performing live at Wembley -- who could ask for more??  Any young'n who's never heard this Bad album I bet would love it too.  You'd have to be a corpse to not bop to these timeless beats.<br /><br />The standout, naturally, is Michael's stunning sold out Wembely concert, attended by Princess Diana and 70,000 screaming fans.  Michael's performance is spellbinding.  It's truly no wonder why he was dubbed the King of Pop.  No other performer, past or present, even comes close to this level of talent, mastery and showmanship.  This is Michael at his best, and at the pinnacle of his career.  His vocals were never stronger, his dancing was never funkier, and his talents and career were truly at their zenith.  This is Michael at his all-time best -- exactly how he should be remembered, forever and always.<br /><br />The true pleasant surprise of this stunning boxed set, is Disk 2 -- a collection of unreleased music that truly is magical in and of itself.  Fly Away, I'm So Blue, Free -- those are my 3 fave tracks off disk 2, and Michael's angelic vocals are pristine and immaculate, just like his beautiful spirit.  Price Of Fame is hauntingly autobiographical, Abortion Papers is infectious, and to hear Michael sing in Spanish and French on 2 alternate versions of I Just Can't Stop Loving You is a real standout.  What a talent.  What a magnificent human being, inside and out.  I'm So Blue also feels bittersweet in it's autobiography. THIS IS MICHAEL at his very best indeed.<br /><br />Buy it for a fan, buy it for yourself -- or give it to someone special.  Even if you've never heard this album before, you'd be hard pressed not to have the beats and Michael's vocals sweep you away.  One of the best albums of all time, hands down.<br /><br />LOVE you Michael!!<br />Always, still and forevermore...evermore...
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual I thoroughly enjoyed this book by best selling author Michael Connelly. Loved the way the action kept going between past & present and the way Harry's dogged determination kept him pushing for the answer.<br />I borrowed this book from my local library and admit that I actually enjoyed physically turning pages. I've been an e-book reader for the last year but really liked that I could flip through previous pages to find a reference to a specific item or character. You can't do that easily with an e-reader.<br />I hope some of you get this book in your Christmas stocking. You'll be glad you did.

B008B3MZNI|5.0|Treat yourself or the Supertramp fan in your life to this wonderfully done DVD. I witness this tour at the Tower theater (Philly) in March of 79. For 32 years I could only listen via audio. Of all their concerts they could have released, to release the one I have a longstanding joy of listening to and now to visually relive that show is a just WOW and so thankful for this gift. And that is what is on my mind now, back to the show.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Loved it, interesting background into success and failure.  Easy to read in vignettes that are quick to read sections.  Hard to put down.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|I expected better writing from him then this. There was too much detail describing uninteresting things such as paying for the bath house, step by description of walking down the street etc. Also was uneasy about the killing of the animals. Overall did not enjoy it. On a positive note it was an easy read.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|Sorry to say that I did not care for several of Susan's interpretations of classic songs.  She seemed quite nasal on several cuts -disappointing!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Captivating and intriguing stories! Couldn't put it down. I've now decided to purchase the full collection of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.

B00A23MYCC|5.0|best comedy of the year by far. Seth Mcfarlane has proved that he is better then just a couple of cartoons.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|Of course I was expecting it to be as good as the first movie but that rarely happens. But it was still a great movie.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I give this movie 5 STARS! So funny, great price, and received it quickly. We have 2 teen agers, and we have a funny movie night that we all enjoy.

B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Just a live verson of Family Guy. Could of been a good movie but fell short and just keep doing same kind of humor over and over.
B000YHG72E|4.0|A film you can watch with your family. I wouldn't call it a Christmas film as it has nothing to do with Christ, rather it is a fairytale that you want to believe, which you can watch anytime of the year. Parents can use it to talk to their kids about being &#34;clued in&#34; and &#34;out of the loop.&#34; How not knowing how culture works can present problems. How sometimes an outside perspective can clarify the way we live. It would be a perfect homeschool lesson. To talk about the culture of the North Pole vs. the culture of modern day New York City. What about them works? What doesn't work? How would you like to see the world interact?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just keeps me guessing over and over. plot change direction very quickly. Has me waiting for whats next. This is the kind of show you can watch and then come back a month or 2 later and its new because yo see what you missed.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Item is as described and functions normally. Recieved item in time expected. Packaged well.  This was a very easy purchase.
B001TODCII|5.0|I never thought of Liam Neeson as an action movie lead, but he manages to do very well in this movie.  Good story and good action from start to finish!
B001NZEHMS|3.0|Classic album, an original.  Not usually my type of music but it completes a collection for me.  Purchased this after one of the original members recently passed away.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Page turner. A book has to quickly get my interest and Safe Haven did just that. Extremely enjoyable read. Fantastic work with the supense\love story combination. Jo was a perfect twist.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I ran across this movie on HBO in the 90's and really could'nt belive what a good show it was !!!!!
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|Great for the younger ones, (and not so young either!), this is what it's all about. Real cute engaging entertainment. (Can't wait for the 24th!)
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Loaded with the right combination of action, plot, and laughs to enjoy a night in.  You'll even like Tom Cruise.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator app. does what it says it 'll do: calculate.<br /><br />I haven't had any problems.  I'm using it on my kindle fire.  the display is large.
B000003NA4|5.0|Diana is fantastic. I own all her music. I suggest you do the same.I think she appeals to all ages.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Very nice set. The hd transfers look great, especially on Alien and Aliens. The only thing I didn't like was that the disc are a little difficult to remove from the cardboard sleeves.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'd say this is one hell of a value for the money. I love Batman and the Dark Knight and I think this package was well done overall.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Won't let me delete emails from my inbox! Yahoo mail apps fail on every device I own. Really stupid, it's time to get it together Yahoo!!!!
B00973902K|5.0|This is a fun song to listen to and we love here at our house. My husband's favorite these days.
B000KIPD5E|4.0|light construction but  you get what you pay for.  so far it has functioned well and I do use it a lot.  it would be nice if it remembered what channel it was last on so when you power cycle it doesnt switch on you.  I mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments.  I have not noticed any sound degradation from using it.  the volume knobs are handy for sure!!
B0082Z447U|5.0|I tried this because this was recommended by my favorite authors (other than Stephen King) Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child in their book Brimstone.  It is well worth reading, if somewhat dated.  It is really enthralling and I loved all the characters, particularly Marian.  Give it a try!
B00A80SHFM|1.0|Whoever put together this soundtrack is a moron. Omitting \\"Do You Hear The People Sing\\" and \\"Who Am I\\", two of the most iconic songs of the musical, is egregious and torpedoes the soundtrack, with the former being perhaps the best sing-along anthem of all time; you might as well have a Grease album without \\"Summer Nights\\". Anyhow, wait for a two-disc set to come out with ALL of the songs.<br /><br />(Aside from that though, the soundtrack, when judged on its own merits and not compared to a stage production, is actually quite good.)
B009MO57H6|2.0|It seemed like the Resident Evil live-action films were just getting real good, then this happened.<br />Aside from the reverse slo-mo speed opening (which was actually pretty cool as a continuation of the ending to the previous film), there wasn't much that got me interested in this.<br />Trademark characters from the games are in this, but the people portraying them do a lackluster job of *looking* like them (Leon Kennedy, for exmaple, looks like a college kid with a trigger fascination), not just sounding like them (Leon in the game has a calm, intelligent demeanor while in the film has a completely offset voice that doesn't fit his character whatsoever).<br />The premise seemed a little slipshod at times, but less than halfway got centered into a comprehensive story with subtle quips that were, at least, interesting. This film decided to take the idea of a game-based movie and make it more like a game. Sequential arcade-esque at first, with some pretty good action. Then the dialogue started to sound like an old-school video game (useless one-liners that were eye-roll worthy). Several scenes that relied on CGI weren't only obvious, it looked like the programming for the CGI came from a 90's computer program (I was nearly struck with nostalgia of Gex and Resident Evil 1), so that was a major dissappointment for an established film franchise that had clearly realistic graphics and weren't afraid to flaunt them before.<br />The EDM score was pretty good and almost had me head-bopping (would've done so if it weren't for the movie) and was appropriate enough for this movie and all the high-tech used in it (production and in-movie).<br />In the end, it gave clear indication for another movie. I am hoping it'll be at least as good as REs 3 and 4.<br />Because RE5 is only half as good as the title. Overall rating: 2.5/5
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Enjoyed the plot and the many surprises throughout the movie.  Action fast paced, characters excellent and drama intense.  Some scenes disturbing but overall recommend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Intense psychological cat and mouse game.  I was on the edge of my seat, blood boiling and fists clenched. So well written, I spent the second half of the book working hard to undue the feelings the first half created. It's long, so be prepared for an all-nighter or two.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|I have now listened to this cd a zillion times!  My daughter loves it that much.  But then again she loves anything Justin Bieber!  lol
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin's work is outstanding.  She creates a view of Lincoln though the lens of those around him.  Excellent language and story telling.  Compelling picture of Lincoln.  I thought the movie was great, but the experience of reading this book goes way beyond that.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Very cute and fun movie!  A family movie the whole family loves to watch together. We really love this movie!
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|First I thought it would be alittle cheap because of the &#34;mesh&#34; bracelet part but decided to try buying it anyway because my husband loves Skagen for being so 'thin'.And wow! NO this is not mesh!!! its like heavy steel material that looks like mesh but not in a  cheap way at all, great price and looks and feels great so i know the husband will love it too!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another great book written by Kate Morton.  I have read all of her other books and thought this one kept you guessing until the end as to the outcome.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|A good family movie. Great reminder about the Joy of Christmas vs commercialism.  My children loved it and that made it good for me
B0086213XW|1.0|What the heck? I just wasted 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Seriously, it is some crazy crap!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I feel that this book was excellent. It had great details and I hated to have to shut it down for the night. The only thing bad about it was if you didn't pay attention to every single detail it was very easy to get lost.
1451695195|4.0|Gives good description of heaven, but can go into too much scientific talk. Can get to be a little off track
034580404X|1.0|the product was not even in the orginal seal and there were wrinkles in the cover of box set. Dont recommend buying it off here
B009MO5E10|4.0|For a change of venue and scenery as far as thriller/chase films go PREMIUM RUSH takes on the bike messengers of NYC and manages to create a story about the derring-do of bike messengers, the seemingly endless tales of bad cops, the cruelty of Chinese immigration cartels, love, and snappy dialogue and provide an enjoyable ride about the great New York City. Written (with John Kamps) and directed by David Koepp whose screenplay writing credits are most impressive, the cast is terrific and seem to be having a great time with this fast paced escapade.<br /><br />Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of 1,500 bike couriers in Manhattan who rides on the edge by having a bike with no brakes. `I like to ride. Fixed gear. No brakes. Can't stop. Don't want to, either.' He has finished law school but has put off taking his bar exam because he can't face the idea of living behind a desk in a boring job. He works for a courier service run by Raj (Aasif Mandvi) along with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) and a rather wild lad Manny (Wol&eacute; Parks, excellent!)On this day, Wilee has a delivery that is so valuable that a corrupt NYC Detective Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon), who needs the money, begins to chase Wilee throughout the city to get it before the envelope is delivered. The plot includes Vanessa's roommate Nima (Jamie Chung) who is in the throes of attempting to payoff the Chinese cartel in order to allow her young son to be brought into the country. The plot twists and turns are managed by frequent flashback episodes they explain the path of events that occur as crises. The supporting cast is strong- the NYPD bike cop (Christopher Chance) and the crew of Chinese actors who clutter the den of the Pai Gow players where the action comes to a head.<br /><br />This is an entertainment movie with some clever cinematic devices and a lot of comment about our present state of communication and law enforcement and immigration problems.  Gordon-Levitt shines and Michael Shannon gives us a repulsively sicko bad cop in full bloom. Grady Harp, December 12ves us a repulsively sicko bad cop in full bloom. Grady Harp, December 12
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|The movie was great and this collection songs by two great singers is great also.  Cher and Christine are a very talented combo.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Always enjoy the Harry Bosch stories, this one was an interesting story well written. Lots of twists and turns and fascinating characters and an unusual ending. Suspense and intrigue always gripping to the end!!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I am a middle school teacher, and am always looking for ways to become more effective with my students. I found this book to be encouraging and thoughtful. It shows how interventions can still be effective for students at many different stages of their lives. It is never too late!
B0086700CM|5.0|i loved the game. it was fun and easy. i love it! i think you should play this game if you like adventers
B0095R64AO|2.0|I like Emily Blunt and Jason Segal, so I expected a bit more from this movie. I felt like we were watching their relationship in real time. It dragged on and on. Kind of a bummer of a movie.
B0068AWO00|4.0|I was a big fan of the original fright night. When I heard of a remake to be made I was a bit apprehensive about someone portraying Evil Ed as well as Stephen Geoffreys did. I found this movie to be a lot of fun, there's no need to compare it to the old version. they are both great movies in their own right. Colin Farrell plays a fantastic vampire, as does Chris Sarandon. Definitely would recommend watching this to anyone.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|My hubby really enjoys superhero anything, and I usually watch because I have to. But we REALLY love this show!! We are mature, in our late 30s/early 40s, and honestly, almost never watch the CW for obvious reasons. But this show surprised us - it is well-written, has a great cast, interesting plot. I've never seen Stephen Amell before this show, and he is really great! (And cute!) I recommend this show highly!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game is fun and interesting. Some screens are picky about the way you place things,  for instance the runes you collect. If you can enlarge your target just a little and drag things GENTLY from  the inventory box it's a little easier. You can only carry 4 items in inventory, but so far it's worked fine. Things are pretty small on the Kindle fire so wear your reading glasses. Lots of puzzles some tricky, some easy.  I had to use the walk through on big fish until I got the hang of how things worked. Beautiful graphics. Maybe too much talk. All in all a pretty fun game.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning. Could not put it down. What an excellent storyline and loved the creepy scenes. Definitely worth getting.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was a little technical at times but did have some interesting sections.have not read any other books with such dark projections of afterlife experiences.Glad Dr. Alexander was able to return to life with no apparent handicaps.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague inc is an overall great game. To beat it at the higher difficulties you need to develop a fairly good strategy, which can take time, but is rewarding. Definitely worth the 99 cents!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this app all the time. Lots of good info.<br />I would highly reccomend this app to anyone with a kindle fire!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I tried to download it, but didn't receive it and because it's free it won't let me re download it.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|There are some really amazing reviews already, so I won't try to fix what isn't broken.<br /><br />This was just an amazing film, quite far beyond anything I had expected when I hit play, and wanted to honor the film with another five star rating. It earned this much from me. I hope many others are blessed by the film.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|not for children.  Great imagination but poorly done for kids.  Thought it was a kid movie.  Would not watch it again.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Having trouble the size of photos cant find the  place to adjust them. This is with my new kindle fire,  Why is this so difficult

0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn has a talent - in all her books - of showing the reader the deep inner workings of her protagonists. We end up not liking them much but we do have a deeper understanding of WHY they do and think the things they do.<br /><br />Libby Day escaped being killed with most of her family. It warped her in all kinds of not-so-nice ways.  She is the protagonist of \\"Dark Places\\" and, at the urging of others (and because she needs money), she tries to figure out whether her testimony as a small girl put her brother in prison wrongfully.<br /><br />Stark, filled with a meanness of spirit and horrifying imagery, this story and the people who haunt its pages, will keep you awake at night. And there's not many books I feel that way about.<br /><br />Flynn's other two books - [[ASIN:1597224588 Sharp Objects]] and [[ASIN:159413605X Gone Girl]] - are also frightening, quirky books well worth reading.
B000VK7KVQ|4.0|Good movie, 2 1/2 hrs well spent if ur into thrillers ESP about a true story... Pretty accurate about case facts but a lil bit Hollywood done.
B000VT7AUS|5.0|I bought this after receiving a free download of a song from her newest album. With all the overproduced music presented today, it is a delight to listen to her soulful presentation
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Prolly the best show on tv 2day & top show of all time! Please stay on air at least 5 more yrs.
B004Y8075M|4.0|The book was in excellent shape.  I had read one before and it was so  strange that I got rid of it.  However, it kept haunting me.  Things would happen that would remind me of this book.  I had to read it again and have it handy for reference.  I rated it &#34;4&#34; because it's an excellent book but I don't necessarily &#34;like&#34; it.  I think it would be good for mature kids (maybe preteen and early teen.......and maybe beyond.  I'm an adult!) to make them think what our world could become if we let government gain too much control.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Omg does jullian makes u work she kicks ass she kicks my ass i just started using it 20 mins of intense workout... Awesome price

B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I like these Heat books. I like to think about Castle writing them. But this one seems familiar, like maybe it is the same as one of the episodes of the show. Our maybe Castle was just using elements of what he has seen on the job in his writing. Still a fun read for a fan of the show.

B001CTDH76|5.0|In The Mentalist, the main character is Patrick Jane (Simon Baker) played with intelligence, charm, coyness and an almost childlike demeanor. Patrick, or Jane, as he's know by his colleagues, is on a mission to kill the nefarious serial killer Red John who murdered his wife and daughter. Jane is frequently asked, \\"Are you a psychic?\\" His reply is always, \\"There's no such thing as psychic's.\\" His dislike of psychic's comes from the good living he used to make as a fake psychic and the tragic mistake he made by doing a psychic reading describing Red John on television. Jane is consumed with guilt because that appearance angered Red John and he killed Jane's family in retribution. A mentalist is, someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion. A master manipulator of thoughts and behavior. Jane, because of his previous experiences and instinctive mental capacity is a powerful mentalist and he uses his talents as a consultant for the CBI (California Bureau of Investigation.) The cockiness and forthrightness he sometimes displays is kept in check by Senior Agent Theresa Lisbon, played masterfully by Robin Tunney. Lisbon and Jane have a complex relationship. At times they are like brother and sister or mother and son, always there for each other with an unspoken respect and perhaps an underlying love. Jane may seem to be wandering around a house or crime scene, but all the while he is taking in information and sizing up the suspects. His crime fighting style is unorthodox, humorous, confounding and sometimes rude. Helping to weed out the villains are Tim Kang as Agent Kimball Cho, Owain Yeoman as Agent Wayne Rigsby and Amanda Righetti as Agent Grace Van Pelt. They all share a camaraderie that resembles a symphony orchestra. None of them is in tune with their jobs without each other. Jane goes with the team to investigate and solve all of the murders assigned to the CBI, but his driving force is to find Red John and have his revenge, that is, to kill him. The furtive longing between Rigsby and Van Pelt is handled with finesse. The plots have twists and turns, sometimes intertwining and always entertaining. The Mentalist is so much more than, let's get the bad guys. It's a delight to watch and to wonder what comes next but, don't try too hard because you'll never guess what it is. I recommend The Mentalist to anyone who enjoys a good crime show or anyone who likes eye candy. Simon Baker will supply you with plenty of that.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|So far so good<br />I like that you can go to the store, shop and buy, then listen with out having to change apps.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The third season of this excellent police procedural finds the CBI looking into everything from hostage taking, one of the abductions being Patrick Jane (Simon Baker,) a California gold rush, a matchmaking service, a decision science profiler, to making peace with an old nemesis. The cast is now such a cohesive force that you feel like you've known them all of your life. Everyone of the characters are played masterfully by the actor's portraying them. Robin Tunney (Special Agent Teresa Lisbon,) Owain Yeoman (Agent Wayne Rigsby,) Tim Kang (Agent Kimball Cho,) Amanda Righetti (Agent Grace Van Pelt) and, of course, the irrepressible Patrick Jane (Simon Baker.) Bruno Heller, the creator of the series, and his collaborate team give you the same standard of plot twist, camaraderie, suspense and keen insight that has made &#34;The Mentalist&#34; the great television series it is. I'm a big fan of Simon Baker but you don't have to be a fan to enjoy &#34;The Mentalist.&#34; The only black mark that I'd put on the third season is how bad Simon Baker's hair looks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Words alone cannot describe  the intensity, beauty, or the pure excitment of this extraordinarily  written novel. i bought it last night and then stayed  up reading it until three in the morning and then finished  it five minutes  ago. I HIGHLY recommend!!!!!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This classic by Charles Dickens is always inspiring to read.  The illustrations were a nice touch to this kindle edition.
B004TACMZ8|3.0|Easy to use. However, I dont think it sensed wood stud well enough. I eventually hung a picture based on my knowledge of my own home and by knocking on wall. Will test some more and leave an update.
B00701897I|3.0|I enjoyed the stoty but didn't see anything particularly exceptional about it.  The animation is wonderful.  It's worht a rental more than a purchase.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Mitch Rapp books...read all of them.  Although I thought the last 2 (American Assassin and Kill Shot) were inferior to the others, The Last Man was back on track.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I bought this last night (thanks Amazon for the $5 price)<br /><br />Some of the songs are chopped in the middle (Look Down) you can almost listen to the whole clip on Itunes.  At the End of the Day is also chopped and after seen you tube clips I know the missing parts are in the movie.  In My Life start when Marius and Eponie arrive the Val Jean part is left off.<br /><br />Other then that and a few lyric changes and music changes (The Final Battle) it is over all pretty well done.<br /><br />I don't find too much passion in Crowes version of Stars and Javert's suicide but He was great in The Confrontation.<br /><br />I hope in time they will release a full version but knowing that someday this will be part of my blue ray/DVD collection is ok with me.<br /><br />Can't wait till 7:25 on Christmas Day when I will finally be seeing this long awaited movie.

B001S86J5S|5.0|If you lived in the 80s then no explanation is needed!  This movie was a classic and in my opinion helped launch Wesley Snipes' career.  Loved the extra features and seeing some of the stars reminisce about the movie.

0156421178|5.0|This was a great book to get a flavor of what the Spanish Civil War was like from one person's perspective. George Orwell went to Barcelona to cover the war as a journalist. He was a labour party guy and it seemed natural to join a communist brigade. This was his experience. If, like me, you like to read several accounts of history from different angles. This is a great one to include.
0321714113|5.0|of course I am retired and i am just doing this for fun. The authors of this book make me really think and work to get it, Just what I wanted.
B000002OX7|5.0|I listened to this a lot when I was younger. If you want a who album for your music collection, I think this is the one to have.
B00A3AUGEW|1.0|i purchased this item on November 24 and it has never been accessible on my computer or any of my devices i feel i was ripped off because my account was immediately debited but NO MUSIC!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play only with free earned coins, coins are available for purchase. This is not a great exciting, adventure filled game. It is a game of mindless strategy. The only strategy is coin placement! How difficult is that?? I find it completely relaxing!!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie comes very close to five stars, and many would call it five stars. It is brilliant, and very very funny.
B004C03L4G|5.0|When you read for each day the topic and message from the angels seems to fit with your state of mind on that day.  The message is one you need to hear.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It's a true anthology that delivers everything you would ever want to know about a movie series, and much,much more. I love the artwork/packaging, too.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|The music is great, the acting and story line... also great!  I enjoyed this as much as my 17 year old daughter.  A new twist on the &#34;GLEE&#34; rage with a capella..
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Wonderful...couldn't put it down.  People often wonder how the world will end and if they will survive it or if they would want to.  This book is a WHAT IF.....
1449410243|1.0|This book is both profane and vulgar. Thought it would be hilarious as I am a cat lover. It was mildly amusing at best. Profane language and crude comments spoiled any humor. I won't even pass this book along to other cat lovers. It went into the recycle bin.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great follow on to the previous book, lots of fun to read.  Enjoyed the humor, light without trying to hard.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another good Grisham with just the right twist but very believable.  Where does he get these ideas? Can't wait for the next one. This would make a great movie!
B0073U2F12|3.0|MIXED BAG OF ACTORS, GO FROM OK TO FLAT OUT FIRST DAY ON THE JOB BAD. STORY LINE HAS SOME PROMISE BUT YOU GET THAT I KNOW I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE FEELING WITH MOST OF THE MOVIE. PURCHASED FOR THE 3D AND IT'S EVEN A MIXED BAG. LONG SHOTS LOOK ARTIFICIAL AND DISTRACT. SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE NOT SO SPECIAL, HAVE THE TV MOVIE OR I MADE IT ON MY MAC LOOK. IT'S OK IF U DON'T EXPECT MUCH, SO GO IN WITH REALLY LOW EXPECTATIONS AND YOU GET WHAT YOU CAME FOR.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. Another good story by Nicholas Sparks.I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys his stories.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|Many people read these reviews to help decide whether they will buy the product or not.  Others (like me, in this case) are just curious to see what other people are saying and have already decided to make the purchase.  Like many other reviewers here, I'm a diehard Star Trek fan, I love everything connected to the Star Trek franchise (with maybe the exception of Star Trek 2009, but that's a whole other story).  But if you're like me and already own the DVD releases of TNG and want to see it in much better quality, then you're going to want to buy this, no matter what the reviews say.<br /><br />Yes there is some inconsistent graininess, and yes sometimes it looks like more than just film grain (a few of the scenes remind me of when we used an antenna on our TV and the channel wasn't tuned properly) and yet it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be, in other words, it's not a &#34;deal-breaker&#34;<br /><br />There's just so much to love about this Season Two Blu-ray release, you can easily get your money's worth with just a small fraction of what it has to offer.  For example, the three versions of &#34;Measure of a Man&#34;, the regular hi-def version, the extended cut, and the extended hybrid cut.  The hybrid cut is very cool because it's kind of like a behind-the-scenes look at the episode - no sound effects (you can hear how the sliding doors actually sound on the set), no music, no chroma key efx in some scene, and no transporter efx in some scenes (they just kind of fade in and out on the transporter pad with no sparkles).  Even though some of these scenes are VHS quality, it's a fascinating look at an episode in it's rawest form, before post-production gets a hold of it.<br /><br />Add to that all the other extras in the set, IMHO, it's worth the price alone.  But then you also get the episodes, for the most part, crystal clear.  You can read the LCARS display when Data picks out &#34;the comic&#34; and realize the comic's name is Ron D. Moore!<br /><br />I was always unhappy with the fact that the regular TOS dvd's looked better than TNG dvd's.  I always though it was odd that something made in the 60's looked better than something made in the late 80's.  But no more, now you can see these episodes &#34;the way they were meant to be seen&#34;<br /><br />I'm not discounting the complaints other reviewers have made, their complaints have merit....a better job could have been done.  But as I said, if you are a Star Trek fan, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't want to get this Blu-Ray set.  The overall quality of the video far outweighs the occasional inconsistencies of film grain and other minor errors.br /><br />I was always unhappy with the fact that the regular TOS dvd's looked better than TNG dvd's.

B006K2WXOI|4.0|I am new to this one, so there's no nostalgia mixed when I say I enjoyed it. The Kindle version looks great. What the Kindle should look like.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|One Day by David Nicholls  I read this book  as a member of a book club and enjoyed it very much. It was  well written and thought provoking and very original
B008D19WBQ|5.0|No has visto Friends hasta que lo ves en alta definici&oacute;n.  La calidad de la imagen y del sonido es asombrosa, estoy muy feliz de haberlos comprado.  Yo tengo los dvd y compar&eacute; la calidad del primer episodio con la del blu ray y la diferencia es notable. Ademas viene en un estuche de lujo que es hermoso.  Este es un producto s&oacute;lo apto para fan&aacute;ticos!!!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Hey guys! I'm an 11 yr old, using my mom's amazon.com. I got my mom to preorder this album, and I got it about 3 days after the release date! And let me tell you, this is completely AWESOME. That's because each and every one of the songs are different and have a meaning to them. So if you wanna buy this album for a girl around my age, then you should DEFINITELY buy this. It's worth your money. :)<br /><br />#1: State of Grace: very poppy, not like the old country Taylor. but still, I think it's great for opening parties.<br /><br />#2: Red: one of my favorites. but um I don't really like the background vocals. ever since Taylor got those background singers, they've kinda ruined the song when Taylor's singing it live.<br /><br />#3: Treacherous: Taylor's voice is very soft in this. I like it. soothing. great for after a long day at school.<br /><br />#4: I Knew You Were Trouble: YAY! Taylor's sorta different in this. I heard she put in some dubstep in this? I think dubstep + Taylor's awesome voice + that twist of country in this song is AWESOME! (oh, and be sure to check out the music video!)<br /><br />#5: All Too Well: it has a steady beat and with Taylor's soft voice, it's pretty good. But not as good as some of the other songs on the album.<br /><br />#6: 22: This song is awesome!!! It's on my top 3 of the album. It's poppy, and when you feel crazy one day, you could just play this song and before you know it, you'll be rocking in your bedroom singing this! Seriously! :D I'd say \\"22\\" is great for sleepovers, when you have your friends over.<br /><br />#7: I Almost Do: This is more like a genuine Taylor song. Good for when you're tired and sorta in a bad mood. Like when you miss someone.<br /><br />#8: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together: I'm pretty sure you've heard this song already. But anyway, it puts you in a good mood especially when someone betrays you (example: friend) or if you got scared of some character in a movie and then you go like, \\"WE! ARE NEVER EVER EVER, GETTING BACK TOGETHER! WE-EEE! ARE NEVER EVER EVER, GETTING BACK TOGETHER!\\" and then after that you feel like you're safe from everything because you have this nice tune stuck in your head. (sorry, I probably didn't make that clear)<br /><br />#9: Stay Stay Stay: This is also like a genuine Taylor song, because Taylor's voice in this is very cheerful. I like it. Top 3!<br /><br />#10: The Last Time: In my opinion, I hate this song. Sorry, but I don't like slow tempo stuff. And with a guy in this, it's horrible. I hardly listen to it.<br /><br />#11: Holy Ground: I like this song. I don't know how to explain this, but it's pretty good.<br /><br />#12: Sad Beautiful Tragic: Very sad song. Ideal for when you're in a super bad mood. beware, this song gets stuck in your head and sometimes makes you sad because it makes you think of sad stuff. Taylor's voice is awesome and moving in this, just like \\"Last Kiss\\" from \\"Speak Now\\", Taylor's previous album.<br /><br />#13: The Lucky One: This one has an awkward tune, but I like it. It does have H-E-double hockey stick in it though. So yeah, but I kinda like this song.<br /><br />#14: Everything Has Changed: Ok. I admit it. I like most of the songs on this album, especially this one. It has Ed Sheeran in it! It's awesome when you put Taylor and Ed together. pretty song.<br /><br />#15: Starlight: This song puts you in a mood that.........makes you feel like you're floating in mid air or something. The song definitely sounds like starlight.<br /><br />#16: Begin Again: Now THIS is country. I think it's the only country song on this album. Wonderful song.<br /><br />So if you're looking for more of the old Taylor but still want great lyrics and want a bit of change, RED is great. Especially for girls around my age.<br /><br />Also think about buying \\"Speak Now\\". In my opinion, Speak Now is better than RED, because you get more of the old country Taylor. But I won't go on reviewing that. :D<br /><br />Bye and hope this helped!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Besides the repeated sex scenes everything else moved pretty fast in the series. I wish it lasted longer, but in the end it was great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The premise, although quite far-fetched was presented so well, that I &#34;suspended disbelief.&#34; There is still much mystery and so I look forward to future revelations. All in all, entertaining!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Ted had some pretty funny parts, also some really lame parts. I mean, it's a talking bear so...<br />I'd wait for the TBS world premier.
B000W9DSVW|3.0|I bought it yesterday and it came in today!! Prime shipping ftw!<br /><br />The quality is not blurray... probably dvd quality i would say.<br />But I don't mind, I bought my favorite trilogy for 10$!
B00A757EFW|5.0|It brought so much memory! Loved the whole interface and action on the Android. Keep up the good work and hope more  games arrive soon.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Moneyball concerns a true story in which the Oakland A's attempt to compete against wealthy MLB franchises that keep buying players with massive budgets. Rather than try to compete head to head, they develop a strategy using statistics, redefining what is important in constructing a winning team.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I purchased the blu-ray version of this and I have been swept away by the photography captured and the commitment of the photographers to their craft to make these images possible. Bravo BBC.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|This book, although not fully completed, is such a great read. I am incredibly interested in learning languages and have tried many programs. This book not only tackles the acquisition of chef mastery but skills and subjects of all varieties. Sometimes you just need to read about those who have done what you are trying to do. That's what TF is great at. Experimenting and easily articulating how you can do what he has done. It was given as a gift and as a gift I would buy one for the next person who loves to get the most of life.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|great story about father and daughter finding out that the trouble from the past come out and bring them together and to become a great team to recrute baseball player who that as good as he could be
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is so fun i hhave it on my Ipod I like the holiday version ot has better characters it is awesome
B009ZE27US|1.0|this is the worst app. it said I was 33 I am more then half less of that!! don't wast ur time on this poppy app
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a lot of fun and very addicting! I even have gotten friends into playing it all the time too!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Probably an app that most people buying a KF will download - this is embarrasing for FB and Amazon.  The app is almost useless in current state - back to using my phone instead of this crisp 8.9&quot; screen for checking Facebook...
B000EXZI14|5.0|I got 3 items from the Bee Gees collection their concert and 2 of their cds i had on cassettes many years ago Children of the World and Spirits Having Flown and they came again with great delivery and great prices! Amazon keeps doing their thing!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|At $5.00 for the MP3 version, you really can't go wrong here.  As expected, Russel Crowe's vocal performance is weak and there are a few songs that definitely fall short of the Broadway soundtracks. However, what this version lacks in musical talent, it makes up for in emotion from the performers.  If nothing else, buy Anne Hathaway's performance of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" - you will be chilled as she beautifully sobs her way through it.  This will go down in history as her performance of a lifetime.  This is wonderful and you won't be disappointed.
B003WTE886|5.0|Do i need to anything more when it comes to a young country phenomenon! Shes amazing and was the last cd that we needed and got her with George Michaels today! Amazon You Rock!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I want more movies simple like this.. acting was amazing  and no cgi thank god.....  Im excited for more movies from this director in the future
B00000DHRX|5.0|George michaels was an teen ideal with Wham! Then became an icon on his own! He might have had a few run ins with the law but his music speaks on its own and nobody can say different! Amazon did a great job getting this and a cd of Taylor Swifts Speak Now which both were at great prices and delivery was fast as usual as promised! I have many more items coming from Amazon!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The best book ever I couldn't stop reading it I devoured every single word on every single page it was the best
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This movie was ok. I thought it could of been a lot better. It was overrated by the comercials. It wasn't what they made it seem.
0525952926|5.0|My suggestion is not to read this book until you have read the first in the series.  As Follett  has done in the past, he follows several families whose lives intertwine through the generations.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I liked the first (couple) of Bourne movies and I really like Jeremy Renner and although it had been pretty much panned, I thought I'd give this movie a whirl.  Sometimes, too much whirling leads to hurling, as in this case.  It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good.  The motive of the bad guys (my favorite bad guys, the guvnment) was muddy, the process ill-defined and the ending just tacked on without any closure (and without leaving us open for another movie to straighten the whole mess out).<br /><br />Save your time -- pass this one.
B0046P2MV0|5.0|These songs are timeless.  Everyone should be exposed to T.Rex,  especially the younger generation who have no clue what this music is.  I am sure they would enjoy this and it would open up their ears to a whole new sound, even if it is over thirty years old.
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|Seems at first like a fairly predictable, if unfathomable, situation where a guy's identity is stolen and someone is pretending to be him.  For what purpose, we cannot figure out.  The story moves along at a good clip, is well-acted and the ending a surprise.  I like Liam Neeson, and would pretty much watch him tie his shoes, so that was a plus, too.  Still an &#34;action hero&#34;!  A couple of hours well-spent.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I had really high hopes for this movie.<br />I don't know why but I did.<br />What a letdown.<br />They show Tatum nude in the first 30 seconds and I wish I would have turned it off after that.<br />The story was horrendous.<br />See Mike and Co. strip.<br />See Mike and Co. use drugs.<br />See Mike and Co. do things that would have them HIV positive in a matter of minutes.<br />UUGH.<br />Boring, gross people doing boring and gross things.<br />Two stars for Tatum and that's being generous.<br />NOT recommended after the first one minute mark.
8866131105|5.0|I use the Moleskine products on a daily product and I'm very pleased with them.  There are imitations, but nothing performs quite like the original Moleskine.  The daily planner I ordered is a hard cover version of one I used last year.  It is of excellent quality and will serve me well in the coming year.  You can't go wrong with Moleskine...if you're wiling to pay a little more for the quality.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great color and graphics. totally enjoyed.wished it was longer. a must for anyone who enjoys hidden puzzle type games. cant wait for a sequel
B0054R6BFM|5.0|My teenage granddaughter gave this book to me to read. Both she and I were both moved by the events that lead up to the suicide. It is a must read for everyone! We just do not know what an impact we have on others.
1439102430|4.0|I enjoy the blend of fact & fiction that Kathy Reichs delivers, but this new book isn't one of my favorites. Her coverage of subject matter seems a bit more superficial than in other Brennan books. Maybe not the best, but a Brennan book is still a good book.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly's Black Box - I've read all of the Harry Bosch novels and this is the first time I have disliked  the character. He seems more arrogant and is stepping on rules, and all that for the sake of a twenty year old case!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing!!  My  family loves this movie!!  Great story!!  I love the accents of the characters.  Wonderful family movie!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I reccomend this for kids under 16.<br />  Its a chance for your child to express their persinalaty. They will love it and never get off it; but be careful sometimes they will have ads to buy coins and tickets.
160774273X|5.0|I have always wondered if great bread making was possible at home.  After moving to NC two years ago I thought I would never eat good bread again. Well, Ken Forkish rules the world as far as I'm concerned.  One would need to go to NYC to find bread this good and to think I make it at home. Everyone raves about the bread and I am becoming a legend in NC.  Thank you Ken.<br /><br />Covered in flour and having a great time.
0446585041|5.0|it  was good and right on time know time to finish the book and have fun with it  and see more
B008Q09K2U|5.0|Dont even think twice, this is another great read from a great author.  Night after night I wanted to put it down and go to sleep, just another chapter.......Shorten your chapters please Nelson......
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think it's a great game but the prices on the stuff needs to go down a lot and I mean a lot. But other than that I love it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is great. I would recommend this for any stage of the relationship. Engaged or married for 30 years.
B001TODCII|5.0|I got this for my husband.  We watched the extended edition, but are not sure how the extended edition is different.  Watching this movie shows that Liam Neeson is a talented actor across the board.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|A little more character development would have been nice. Jeremy is not quite as compelling as Matt. Great action scenes and nice &#34;end&#34; of the badest guy. Overall good movie.
0307473708|5.0|This product works great. I would recommend it to anyone! It has lasted a long time for me and it is a good buy!
B0083DJWGO|3.0|But I found some of Taleb's treatment of most of his fellow humans to be condescending.  In the end, I rate this book be not as good as Black Swans, and not very clear in its development.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|My favorite game. I play it every day and it's still challenging and keeps me interested. You can keep playing through all the levels even after you've beat them all.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This is a quirky movie that is so interesting you just have to keep watching.  I love the acting in this movie.  The humor in this movie is quite dry, which I really love.  It's a keeper for me!
030758836X|5.0|This book is full of unexpected plot twists and turns. The ending was great and unexpected. I read the book in one day. I'll definitely pick up Gillian Flynn's other books!
B008602KQI|5.0|I couldn't put the book down once I started reading.  This movie followed the book very closely.  Very well done and entertaining.  Something to think about.
0385344228|5.0|Warning do not start this book if you do not have time to read it in one sitting! It's a page turning thriller, and the ending is great!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|The series has great video clarity, the sound quality is beautiful and if you have 5.1 surround, it's even better than the TV broadcast. All the episodes are there, the menu flow is logical, and, for once, it even continues episode to episode from any start point, not just &#34;Play All&#34; from the beginning or else play them one at a time. Nice boxed set. Not a lot of extra reading material, but lots of cast interviews after each season. More than worth the purchase. My greatest disaapointment is they ended too soon. Is you are a fan of TBBT, this is the set you want.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This book pulls the reader in and makes them realize the importance of the love that binds a family together.
B0029XFN9O|2.0|I bought Home Alone and Home Alone 2 at the same time and the same place. Home Alone is a great Blu-ray movie. Home Alone 2 is a bad copy of a DVD original. Grainy, sounds a little hollow or having a slight echo. No extra materials whatsoever, so you get the movie and that's it. The DVD in widescreen format is as good or better than this Blu-ray. However, highly recommend Home Alone on Blu-ray.
1612183956|3.0|The book sounded interesting, but in a nutshell, there was too much tension, and not enough payoff. Readers need a break from tension during a story, I felt far too few respites in this book. Also, the author heaped mysteries on the reader with no intermediate payoff.<br /><br />Interesting, but not satisfying.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Very good movie. It was nonstop laughter. I think that it had a creepy/serious turn to it but it was funny.
B004DNWPY4|2.0|I was expecting something more from a book that was so popular and considered a classic by now. I expected something more  like a look into the lives of the millionaire families who seem to blend with society. Something that told you valuable information and secrets of the wealthy. What this book boils down to is that people who are cheap, frugal and generally annoying about saving every penny they can also seem to be the one's who save that money therefore becoming wealthy at an old age. - And that younger people who make high incomes tend to blow money rather than save and invest. There I just told you the whole book.<br /><br />I expected something good, but all this book was is just a long book report on financial facts and numbers and polls, trends and other figures. It was more speculative and generalized than what i expected.<br /><br />Every other page is a report of something useless. i.e. 37% of Under achievers of wealth consume soda beverages more than once a day. 41% of over achievers of wealth drive old outdated vehicles - and boring factoids such as that is all this book is filled with.
B009VB97EY|5.0|This is a movie for girls, of course, but it did have a fairly decent plot. I enjoyed the men dancing. Nothing better than that!
B0048WQDIE|5.0|An American classic.  Holds its edge after decades.  Belongs in the pantheon of American fiction - oh, wait, it already holds a place in that august company.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This was an ok movie. The plot was a bit slow I think but it was apparently based on a true story. It's a good movie but if you saw the previews, I think you saw most of the movie.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|It's not HBO, but Showtime has created a good series, it gets pretty boring at times but all in all, it's worth watching
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Nice weekend get away read... Interesting enough to keep my attention for a 3 hour flight back and forth. No plot reveals. Just download and read. You won't regret it!
B000JQUKKU|4.0|This is such a famous and beloved story that there is little need to critique it.  The Kindle version remains true to the original.  There is not much sense in complaining about a free download, but it would have been nice if the table of contents featured the original five &#34;staves&#34; or chapters.  Instead, you must start at the beginning and go from there.  A great bargain!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|It would be a lie to say that I did not enjoy the book, but if you compare it to the first three books, it does not meet the standard.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater, and I'm glad it has been released on both DVD and Blu-Ray.  I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />However, all I can say is, I'm glad the Blu-Ray version comes with a regular DVD, because, for whatever reason, the Blu-Ray disc cannot be recognized by my My Panasonic DMP-BD60.  The firmware is up-to-date, and every other BD I have plays perfectly on it. Unfortunately, though, it seems Ted won't play in it, so I'm stuck using the regular DVD.<br /><br />And, for the record, the disc is also unrecognized by my PS3 and both my DVD PC drives. I can't help wondering if my BD copy is simply defective or if my BD60 is becoming obsolete.  I'm sure I'll do a little more troubleshooting before giving up (or coming to any conclusions), but any help or input is welcome.<br /><br />EDIT (5/15/13): Well, as it turns out, the Blu-Ray disc wasn't defective at all. It seems that the disc is incompatible with my slightly older Panasonic DMP-BD60 (and the PS3 and CD-ROM drivers). After purchasing an LG BP220 BR player, the disc plays just fine. :-)
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Came In the mail very quickly in a sealed package. I put it in the DVD player and played perfect.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really love this game. I feel like I'm part of the show lol a must for anyone who enjoys the show also.
B00866JL96|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and would recommend it to anyone who loves Nicholas Sparks type movies.  Great story line and is well worth the money to buy.
B006X415GK|5.0|My niece will love this doll, she has majority of the Monster High dolls but this was missing from her collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Since I don't have an xbox and my computer is old,? this is the only minecraft I can buy. It is so worth the the seven dollars. This is not great its awesome. I can't wait until they add armor.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|really enjoy all the angry birds but if you are a star wars fan this great to play, so get it and enjoy
B007URVZJ6|4.0|A very easy to read book with simple to follow instructions that made editing my novel for Kindle a breeze. Something like this is necessary for anyone self-publishing to Kindle for the first time.

B0084HJE0S|4.0|This is the book to read before you try anything else on HTML5.<br />Most specialists leave me confused when they explain all the benefits of the new generation of coding. Kyle Simpson makes everything clear. He gives the best history I've read of the battle between JavaScript and Flash -- and why HTML5 won.<br />It's not for hardened coders,  and none of the quotes on the site really capture the downhome flavor of what is (and meant to be) just a pamphlet. But the co-author of O'Reilly's HTML5 Cookbook will get you fired up for the Next Web.<br />Do you absolutely need to bite into this short appetizer? No, but you will probably be very glad you tried it while waiting for the main course.

B009NTNHJU|5.0|This is seriously a really great album..worth it. It has a lot more of the Nicki Minaj that I love.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|After seeing this is the theater, I have been revisiting the original Alien series to see how it flows and overall, it does a nice job for the first couple of movies, which is all I could expect.  The writers did a great job setting up the story for 'later.'<br /><br />My main gripe is that while I normally park most of my critical thinking in movies like these, some things in the end were just beyond my tolerance for feasibility.  I won't ruin it for you, however.<br /><br />The filmmaking is superb, and if you ever get the chance to see it in 3D, make sure you do so. It is one of the very few movies to look better that way.  I can count on one hand the others.

B005WTR4ZI|4.0|First of all let me warn potential readers that this is a very short book. It's more like a magazine article than a real book. There are really only three chapters with content. The first three chapters make the case that humans are in a race with machines and are losing. The subsequent chapters reads like they were demanded by the publisher so as to have a \\"happy ending\\" and to flesh out the rather thin document.<br /><br />I had hoped for more statistics and models. We get instead mostly anecdotes.<br /><br />Finally they have completely overlooked one obvious implication of these trends - race trouble. Currently 40% of black teens are unemployed. These are the least attractive employees in the job market. They are the type of person who are the first victims of automation.<br /><br />Arnold the Terminator is indeed coming for mankind but he's coming for blacks first. If the authors are right then in a few years most young black men will be unemployed. They will miss the socialization of that first job. They will be high school drop outs who have never learned the lessons of the work place. They will be increasingly drawn to drugs, gangs, and crime.<br /><br />The authors try to say that automation hits all strata of the job market but it doesn't - as they present evidence to the contrary themselves. The 'technologically unemployed' are already to be seen among the denizens of Detroit - and they're all black. The authors relate some anecdotes about how even highly skilled people get caught by automation. But there's a big difference between a Japanese American with a graduate degree in engineering losing his job and a black teen. Thr Japanese guy just gets another job in another field. The black teen doesn't get that first job and never gets another for his entire life.<br /><br />Automation of field work drove the blacks out of Mississippi. Then it drove them out of the auto assembly plants. Automation isn't through with black people yet. America looks to be headed for real racial trouble because of the unequal effects of automation.ed for real racial trouble because of the unequal effects of automation.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|- Perseus (picks up a toy owl): \\"What is this?\\"<br />- One of his honor guard, abruptly: \\"Just leave it!\\"<br /><br />I hope you didn't watch either versions of CLASH OF THE TITANS to prep for a Greek mythology exam, because it's gonna get ugly when the test results come in. If I had to choose I guess I'd roll with the original 1981 version, because it came first and because it featured Ray Harryhausen's vintage stop-motion magic and the hotness of Judi Bowker and that dang cute metal owl (which, awesomely, is referenced in the 2010 reimagining). Still, flaws and all, this new version has got its boasting moments. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this most recent CLASH OF THE TITANS.<br /><br />Sam Worthington has a presence, but it's more your stolid, taciturn, seething sort. It's understandable, given that his character, Perseus, is a young fisherman whose parents and sister have just been struck down by the god of the Underworld. Never mind that their deaths were more incidental than anything, given that Hades (Ralph Fiennes) was targeting a slew of warriors who had just torn down a statue of Zeus.<br /><br />Zeus, head of the Greek pantheon, created man so that the gods could grow strong from man's worship. But Zeus (Liam Neeson) created man in his image. Why was he taken aback when man grew arrogant and prideful? As the film opens, mortals are in rebellion against the gods. And when Queen Cassiopeia of Argos, at her height of folly, brags of her daughter Andromeda's beauty eclipsing even that of Aphrodite, the gods have had enough. Hades swoops down and does something awful to the queen and then pronounces Argos's doom: In ten days the monstrous Kraken will be unleashed... unless Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed.<br /><br />The nation of Argos has one hope. Perseus in their midst is discovered to be a demi-god, the son of Zeus himself. The king of Argos beseeches Perseus to play savior. But Perseus has eyes only for revenge for his family's deaths. And since there is a converging point between his goals and that of the king, he takes up the cause. He's given an escort of soldiers. Off they go to negate what Cassiopeia's brag has wrought. Perseus is guided by Io (Gemma Arterton), an ageless woman who'd been safeguarding him all his life.<br /><br />If you want to enjoy this film, you simply can't obsess on plot holes. You'll find oodles (one example: the murderous but then suddenly tame monster scorpions). The narrative shortcut of the deux ex machina is in full effect (cough*Pegasus*cough). CLASH OF THE TITANS is a triumph of technical craftsmanship. The expert CG overshadows the standard caliber of acting put in even by luminaries like Fiennes and Neeson. I personally think Mads Mikkelson is the best actor of the lot, playing the jaded, cynical Argosian soldier Draco. Sam Worthington, sporting a daring buzz cut in a world of shaggy hair and runaway beards, manifests his character's demigod ambiguity. Since Perseus hails from divinity, maybe it makes sense that he suddenly exhibits spectacular martial prowess for a simple fisherman. Still, I'm fond of these goofy Greek mythologies come to life. CLASH OF THE TITANS is a popcorn flick, fantastic focus on action, dismissive of coherent narrative continuity. Sit back and watch as the relentless Perseus and his steadily dwindling honor guard fight off a gauntlet of slick computer generated monsters. But I sort of miss Ray Harryhausen's stuff. And Judi Bowker. And that cute metallic owl.ce there is a converging point between his goals and that of the king, he takes up the cause. He's given an escort of soldiers.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell Reflect is a puzzle like app that challenges you to use you mind. The object is to navigate your way around a maze type senario where you are to collect thise circular objects. If you get stuck it provides you with hints that you can purchase from your already collected coins. Now there are spikes around so in tryng to clear your board to get to the next level you need to choose wisely. No harm, if you mess up you can retry. There is music background which is tranquil and nice playing and love to hear the ping sound as I progress, not when I run into spikes. There are levels and as you continue more some of the bubble type circles can double and some are deadly, and some levels are divided so you have to figure how to get to the other side. Its worth it and great for killing time in appointments or just taking a break. Theres no need to hesitate if your thinking it is a nice app very crystal clear and there are instructions/options. Thanks to the seller and Amazon! Love you guys!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|One word: implausibility. Who doesn't like Liam Neeson, but this film is really awful. It's difficult to know where to start, but the two central concepts that defy belief are these: that a passenger jet could go down on American soil and no one will be interested in getting to the crash site; second, that on a planeload of roughnecks returning from a drillsite near the Arctic Circle, there is ONE firearm, and it becomes inoperable because of the crash. There are many more, but the film depends on your acceptance of these whoppers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I decided to use this app because it was suggested to me so that I can use it with another downlaod in order to see abc.com website since it no longer has been working on my fire because of their upgrade. However, since I am not too savy with this stuff I decided to remove it. However, for someone more familar with these things it would most likely be good to their liking. It downloaded well and provided much to experiement and get use to but I am not that great in figuring things out of this nature. I guess one would have to see if it is something they can use with use of another browser, I just did not want to have to go through the process to catch up on the programs but it appears nice.

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My gran an I have played this and our other family members, so many kindle fires lol. The graphics are beautiful clear and the music is nice love cutting the rope. There are levels and it gets challanging along the way. The object is to obtain stars or other and cut the rope to feed the little guy but as the rope swings you need to figure if cutting the rope at the right time will make you conquer that level. Totally lots of fun! Thanks!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a rule I tend to be skeptical about the subject covered in this book. There are just too many books that purport to be about a &#34;near death experience&#34; that prove to be impossible to accept. But Dr. Alexander writes with the authority of a successful Neurosurgeon. One who had witnessed this phenomena in his patients but thought that his patients were experiencing hallucinations as a result of trauma.<br /><br />His experience taught him that, while this may be the case in many such experiences, trauma induced hallucinations aren't the answer in all cases. Plus the book is well written and logically organized.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I've been playing this game for a while, and I can't put it down. The game is excellent, and it allows you to be creative unlike some other games. I've noticed some flaws though. It won't let me join other games, it doesn't have as much stuff to build with as the PC or Xbox version, and I can't use any cheats(not that I use them). Also, if you now why I'm having troubles joining games, please help me.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read \\"American Sniper\\" because I had read \\"No Easy Day\\" by Mark Owen, another Nave Seal. I wanted to compare and see how real Mark described the life of a member of one of the greatest fighting forces in our country. I really expected Chris Kyle to talk just about his \\"kills\\". Chris went into much more detail about the daily life and how the Seals are a part of the military, one important piece that works well the the other branches to make our military the best in the world. By the time I finished the book I felt like I knew Chris and his family and was really pulling for him. He introduced several other soldiers whom I have heard of in the news. Overall, it was a book I didn't want to put down. I have even more admiration now for the heroes that keep our nation free.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series is captivating. Could not put it down until done. The only thing I don't like is WAITING FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT!
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|abd didn't get it...this movie had some really good looking people in it..and that about sums it up...the premiss was good..the execution stunk...
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The premise is good, visuals are good. Acting is okay. I guess that's it. I'm not a terrific reviewer and the movie isn't really inspiring me to do much more than this.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|i really enjoyed the first two movies in this trilogy..this one was a super huge disappointment...boring pretty much sums it up...the big fight scenes where childish at best...bane..bain..the big dumb idiot was terrible as a villian..just plain dumb...not a good way for the franchise to end...god i hope the ending doesn't signal another atrocious movie in the future...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The evolution of characters was ok, but what I liked better was the evolution of the war. Collins did a good job of making it not about good vs evil. Both sides had flaws.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|lots of wham bam in this movie...not sure they did much for the franchise though...super genetically enhanced dude kind of takes it to somewhere else than the the original movies....
B004HD61KE|5.0|I accidentally came across Sigma Force novels while camping one year. The book I brought sucked and when @ the local grocery store picking up supplies, I grabbed an old one out of the bargain bin.It ended up being exactly what I wanted for camping. I love how he intertwines history with modern fiction. They're perfect easy action summer reads.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I'm totally satisfied with this system. I have traveled with it and have had no problem since August 2012. The Screen is cyrstal clear and bright. All the connections are perfectly located. I have placed a Xbox slim and orignal into the gaming system with no problems. Just rember to turn the bottom pad the the correct Xbox console. The only the thing I wish they would improve is the Lid with the monitor in it. It needs a stop strap or catch for with you sit it up on a small surface that is not big enough to catch the lid that the base sits on. I have run into alot of hotels that you have to be careful if you set it up on the bed (soft base) that the screen does not got to far back. Just make sure you have a good hard surface to sit it up on that supports the screen. Not a problem as long as you know about this. I love this system. Watch all the movies you want on Nexflex when traveling. Great product.

B009K0P10K|3.0|This season is much more predictable than season 1 and some of the new plots not as interesting. Still worth watching compared to other series on tv. Maybe second half will be better.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of anything Dr. Seuss and this movie was very well done. Loved it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really like this book and how its written. And personally, I think you could stop @ this one. I felt like the 2nd one was a waste of time and the 3rd one really didn't deliver for the amount of time I put into reading them.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Mr. Clancy is a fine novelist...without question.  He develops characters to the extent that you become involved in what may happen to them.  He stands among the few at the top of this list of authors who write fiction with flairs of nuance that allow you to feel you are present in the midst of the action.  I have learned that the secret of reading his most interesting works is to recognize when you can scan and skip sometimes three pages of information that has little to do with the story or the characters, but seems to be placed in the novel for no other reason that to affirm history which can be found in other places.  I enjoy his books.

B000X2H8G4|3.0|I found this product to work the best when used with earphones instead of headphones, and I only use one of the earphones and let the other ear piece dangle. It helps minimize the background ambient noise substantially with this technique when I watch TV. It would be nice if there was a battery indicator or replacement beeps like with hearing aids, because the sound definitely eases softer and softer as the battery level goes down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tried the sample.......yeah then I had to buy the whole series. So great! The writing style and speed of the story were perfect. He's not afraid to kill a great character. I haven't read anything else by Hugh, had never heard of him before stumbling across Wool. I promise you this.....I'll be looking for more by this author!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This series was interesting enough but I found after I read the book ...I felt like it was possibly a bad message to send to women.  We struggle as it is not to be dominated.

0525952926|2.0|I always finish a book once I start it. I couldn't finish this it is the most boring book I have ever read. I love historical novels but this one was painful! I find it fascinating that many apparently found this book a great read. I read other books by Ken Follette and enjoyed them. I will conclude that if you need a book to put you to sleep than this is the one to choose!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|A very tasteful amendment to the trilogy. Like a good cup of coffee after desert. The movie continually provides a constant level of entertainment with all the right qualities. It perfectly exercises a good HT system. With its DTS-MA audio mixed very well, each channel is pronounced with perfect staging, including the sub channel which consistently provides the appropriate room-rumble when awakened. No dynamic volume compression from the viewer is required either.  This film brings its thrill of surprise to the audience without rude \\"volume hikes\\" but instead with a story line of well-designed and often unexpected twists in plot. The whole A/V experience truly is \\"mastered\\" and pleasantly assembled.<br /><br />The video is of course also up to its par, with rich deep color dripping from multiple pallets; rendering discernible shades of purple and black, even during the dimmest of low light scenes.<br />The acting - like the action - is simply excellent - with even the over-the-top portions remaining within the realm of \\"believable\\", yet \\"stretching\\" the fringes of ones imagination, considering state-of-the-art technologies.<br /><br />The actors themselves were pure perfection, as thankfully expected - considering the larger-than-life individual talents automatically on tap with Cain, Freeman, and Bale. But the others of perhaps lesser film experience were no less brilliant and notable, namely both of the heroine beauties Hathaway and Cotillard - who will no doubt continue to amaze viewers for decades.<br /><br />Bale's depiction of the Batman is likely to be scored second to none. And \\"personally\\" - I find his deep scratchy voice tone to be fearfully good - as it grips the soul with a masterful fist-clinching \\"yeah!\\" - each time he asserts it from beneath the mask.<br />(For example: In the first movie \\"Begins\\" - when he was holding the caught criminal at a life-threatening height to get information, the thug said \\"...I swear to God!\\" - but Batman shrieked back athim, \\"Swear to ME!!\\").<br /><br />The \\"Dark Knight Rises\\" repeats this type of dominating command across the board in performances.  See it, borrow it, or buy it. You will not be disappointed.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I had read some reviews before i read this book complaining about the author and devaluing her novel. I cant say it loudly enough that \\"I loved this book\\". Between the great stories of her youth, the love of her mother, the flashbacks thru the book, the discriptive narration of the beauty that she was hiking through! I had just returned to reading for pleasure after nursing school had killed any desire to pick up a book for years. I had read three of Christopher Moore's books and my wife couldn't understand why i hadn't responded to them the way i had to this wonderful book.  Thank you for this and im so glad i was listening to npr the day you gave an interview.<br />I am now preparing to make that hike because of you. :)

B00A196SE2|1.0|Why should I buy this? Not only the cover art is ridiculous to say the least (I don't get why it features Ivy since she is in the show only the last two seasons - it should feature Vanessa and Jenny), but it's 100% clear that the people who took care of it are morons who don't know a thing about Gossip Girl.<br />Yup, if you read the back sleeve it says \\"Upper WEST side\\". I don't see why people should spend 100+ bucks for such a thing.
0316228532|4.0|One cannot stop being marveled at JK Rowling's literary brilliance, and for good measure. Words flow in the book so eloquently and naturally that you're left astounded that they could be mixed up in such a brilliant manner.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy soaks you completely in the many shades of human psyche and makes you empathize, dislike and laugh with or at them. The characters are developed beautifully, even posthumously, bringing in their uniqueness and personality to affect others and though the plot is more like a soap opera revealing itself in numerous episodes,through her words and great understanding of human character, she makes the tale less drama and more realistic. It's not the kind of book that hits you in one go but instead slowly makes it's way into your thoughts and your conscience and you're awed by the complexity of human nature- to help when you have nothing, to do nothing when you can, to give up on relations that have nothing wrong or to hold on to things you have to let go of or to fight powers that you do not understand or to make mistakes that are the only way to get rid off your problems- the book forces you to be slow to criticize and more open to believing that people have their reasons and their stories.<br /><br />A real development from the Harry potter feet, I salute her versatility and her ability to observe and narrate and proclaim myself to be an ardent follower through all her literary journeys.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have no regrets from reading this book. With its publication, the brilliant John Green is an author on a whole new level.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It's different and a fast read. A very tender story. I would recommend it.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I first saw this movie as a rental at my public library. I don't often *buy* DVDs, for the simple fact I don't find too much worth paying to view at the movies, let alone buy to own.<br /><br />But this was a rare exception. I *had* to buy it. Loved Tom Hanks in the part. The story was heartwarming, and the animation was well done. It was just a wonderful way to enjoy a beautifully-done, holiday-themed movie.<br /><br />I got the standard definition, as that was all that was available at the time. I considered buying the Blu-ray version afterwards, but honestly, the picture I got was so good, I'm not sure how much better the Blu-ray version could be. I may still end up buying the Blu-ray edition in the future, but for now, I'll enjoy my standard definition.<br /><br />For me, this was definitely worth the price for some excellent, holiday entertainment.

B007PVHBHC|2.0|You are more deluded than when you wrote \\"People have the Power.\\" Sounds good but has no basis in reality.<br />\\" MONEY,OIL,GOLD,LAND is the power and you damned well know it. A children's choir to ruin a Neil Young song that has more integrity than this entire album. I hate it. I was an avid fan until I read the liner notes to this album...what drivel. The only thing your children and \\"all the children of the world\\" will be able to do is consume the crumbs you and your (the unbelievable complacent gall) megalomaniacal baby BOOMER generation will leave them. What else have you taught them. Escapism. Maybe in your deluded head they'll find a planet to escape to beyond \\"the blister of Jupiter.\\" Please.  Your last name should be \\"Jones.\\" And who gives a damn that Johnny Depp is your \\"friend\\". He's supposedly Keith Richard's friend too. Two grisled old narcissistic \\"April Fools\\" feeding their egos with younger, far cooler and more famous meat. The equivalent of Madonna kissing Britney Speers. Buzzards. Richards is not a pirate and you are not an explorer. Think about something other than your rock image. What an absolute let-down. You were so real and sorrowful and rageful and passionate when you performed in Nashville in the late '90s. Where is she. Be ashamed for picking the bones of Amy Winehouse while you're at it. This is the last of your Girl of Wonder with the Susan B. Anthony visage crappy \\"Americana\\" routines that I will purchase. Next we'll probably see you as a practicing martyr, saint- wannabe Catholic. Or sharing an exhibit with Keith Richards at Disney Land. Leave the children out of it.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Still have tears in my eyes after replaying the Epilogue for the second time (yes, I was a dork and did the Mis March step...).  It is RAW, especially Jackman throughout and Hathaway is so heavenly in the final scene (no, it blesses your soul, like God is saying, \\"You are worthy\\").<br /><br />Jackman's voice is very, very, very unique.  It will be hard for the Wilkinson and other Jean Valjean fans to accept his quality, I think.  BUT, again I will use the word, RAW!  It has an emotion that is real time REAL.  It is an adjustment from the recordings we've been listening to for years.  But give it its due.  And then wait the three days to see the VISUALS!!!!!<br /><br />Crowe, Baron Cohen, Banks, Seyfried,Bonham Carter are not the Broadway cast. Still they take this musical to the street level, as in, if I were to start singing about my life to Sonoko, the nice lady two houses down. In spite of my usual dislike of Bonham Carter, she spins a new turn, as does Cohen, which is refreshing after 25+ yrs. and let's be honest, a hard thing to do.<br /><br />Sorry, but I don't think Suddenly adds anything. Personally, I think it was included as a song tailored to Jackman's vocal quality and perhaps to really dispurse any question that he took in Cosette for an honorable reason and he benifits from that generous gesture.  Not a great song.  Will give Jackman credit for making it sound like the way my son looks when he holds his three month old first child, first daugher. It has a quality of amazement, which is appropriate.<br /><br />Hummmmmmmmmmmmm, Crowe's Stars is sooo very, very different from other interpretations I've heard, live or recorded.  It is more lyrical, small, than any other version. I listened to it struggling to see if it fit the song. Still out on, that waiting on the visuals, but I love that this film seems to take a VERY VERY established piece and breath some new life into it.<br /><br />The cafe' scene and Red/Black as you would anticipate: young men,it's well done.<br /><br />In My Life/Heart Full of Love???? Has never been my fav part... Seyfried is reedy, but I know when I just sing lines to people, I don't sound perfect. Banks is breath taking!! And final trio harmony of this song makes me close my eyes and breath deep like I'm smelling an amazing perfume.<br /><br />On My Own is in my top three for this musical.  It has a LONG association with men I've loved and not told. That being said, this is how I would intrepret this song. Best performance of it.  And I love me some Miss Lea...<br /><br />It's worth the money to buy this and I will surely invest in a full length recording (hint, please).<br /><br />It's the music and lyrics we love, NOT staged in the perfection of a recording studio, but sung outside our front doors. And, no matter what, you know these lyrics, you know these songs, and they are as needed today as they were in '85 when it hit the world.  I think there is some poignancy to the timing of the release.  It is a time to hear the people sing and hear the distant drum... there has to be change. This IS the epic all the critics predict, it will be the diehard Les Mis fans that could kill it. This is the flash mob Les Mis.  Takin' it to the streets which is where it is set.<br /><br />Four stars because the recording is muddy and low. Had to have my volume cranked about twice the normal level I usually set it at, and it was still quiet and muddy. I am a snob about ending your phrases.<br /><br />Addendum: Had not listened to \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" totally because I don't really like the song. Finally listened to Miss Hathaway sing it.... no wonder she got the Golden Globe nob. Mindblowing... strains of Castle on a Cloud playing now... what strickes me about this recording is how it makes life a musical... it sounds like people are just extending their normal conversation.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read the five existing books back to back.  There will be two more, yet to be written.  These books are so long that by the last book, I just wanted to be done with them.  Don't get me wrong, the story is definitely worth reading.  The characters are rich and colorful.  The HBO series really brings these books to life.  If you can't read the books, definitely see the HBO series.  This series is full of interesting characters.  Sometimes it's difficult to keep all the characters straight.  But there is a list of characters and relationships to each other at the end of each book.  The author's style is very easy to read.  I would definitely suggest this series to my friends.  And I'll read the final two books when they are released.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Charlize is wonderful!!  Just a little curious on what is the relationship between Snow and the Huntsman at the end. Too bad that likely there will not be a sequel with both of them.
0307346617|3.0|I borrowed this book from a friend.  I was excited about it after seeing a trailer about the movie.  I was pretty disappointed.  It is a series of interviews that tell you a piece at a time what the war was like all over the world.  There was virtually no suspense.  However, I kept reading it to see how it would end.  I'm hoping the movie is much better and not portrayed as the dry series of interviews portrayed in the book.
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|Billy Wilder's 1960 film still packs a punch today, with its cynical look at office politics, in which C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) climbs up the greasy pole of success by renting out his apartment to his superior so that they can enjoy various one-night stands.  To them women such as Fran Kubelik (Shirley Maclaine) are mere commodities, to be picked up and put down at will, rather like the files that adorn Baxter's office.  Despite numerous indignities, Baxter retains a basic goodness of heart, and is rewarded at the end when Fran leaves her boyfriend Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) at a New Year's Eve party and runs across town to be with Baxter.  A lot might have changed since 1960, especially in terms of gender equality, but Wilder's film still shows how 'success' often depends on prostituting one's talents, both literally and metaphorically.  The three principals are just brilliant in their roles: Lemmon's Baxter a bundle of nervous energy, contrasted with MacMurray's more laid-back acting, and Maclaine in the middle, both waif-like and knowledgeable at the same time.  An absolute classic.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|This is a good app if you want something to fill time with. But I found two things with this app-you won't  learn the song to be able to play at a real piano as it goes too fast (even at slow speeds) to notice what notes are played and I found the speeds don't adjust to the speed I was playing. It wants you adjust to it's  speed which made it hard as I was either waiting on note to be played or struggling to keep up.

0307346617|4.0|Listen. I don't believe in Zombies. I don't like the whole Zombie craze. Vampire stories don't do it for me. I'm just not into the living dead genre.<br /><br />This book is awesome. Max Brooks approach to writing this book was creative, simple, and believable. Rather than a narration by a narrator, it is written as a series of interviews by someone writing a report of an apocalyptic, world wide war against Zombies. Zombies crazily craving human flesh. They are unstoppable short of destroying their brain. They freeze in winter climes, but thaw out when the snow melts. They walk along the ocean floor. They attack relentlessly even when limbless and unable to ambulate.<br /><br />When it comes to fighting them, technology doesn't work. Conventional wartime propaganda and psychological warfare are ineffective. The threat of death doesn't work because they are already dead. It seems that mankind is going the way of the dinosaur and we might as well get used to the idea.<br /><br />Or should we.<br /><br />This book is in the process of being adapted as a major motion picture starring Brad Pitt. Here's a trailer. [...]<br /><br />Get the book before you see the movie. That way you can be truly smug like me, look down your nose at your friends and declare, \\"The book was way better. Oh, you didn't read it?\\"

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I got the free kindle version of the book just to try out the kindle app on android and now I'm reading on a daily basis!
B008B11RLQ|3.0|For some reason they chose not to use the original cover art of the first pressings in most cases, but rather various reissue versions of the cover art. For those who do not care for some of the songs being repeated due to additional tracks on some CD. In some case the mastering is completely different.  The 8 Good Times tracks on Promised Land sound very different than those same tracks on the actual Good Times CD.  A great example is Loving Arms.  On the Good Times CD Elvis' voice is recessed and has lots of echo, the drums are dull. On the remixed Promised Land CD Elvis' voice is upfront, dry (no echo) and the drums have very sharp transient attack.  So, if you investigate various versions of remastering, like Vic Asenini vs Dennis Ferrante (for example) a whole new word may open up to you.  It is not always the latest round of remastering that is the best.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book broke my heart and gave me hope.  The fact that people survive some of the things this poor girl did amazes me.  Very well written!
B000YHG72E|4.0|The holiday season is not complete unless I've watched Elf. It's a silly, fish-out-of-water tale about a man who works at the North Pole, thinks he's an elf, and then when he realizes he's a human, goes to New York City to find his real dad. It's quoteable, fun, and appropriate for all ages.

0345803485|1.0|I don't like to write negative reviews, but my subconscious mind put her hands on her hips, and bullied me into posting this review. I gasped. I flushed crimson red. Oh, my! My subconscious mind can be so bossy.<br /><br />Is this book a practical joke? Since when did the New York Times engage in practical jokes? I am biting my lip in consternation. I am so aghast. I flush, I blush crimson - or was it scarlet? I free my lip. I bite it again. I gasp. Even my subconscious mind is silent. This is the most boring, unreadable book I've ever read! The absolute worst!! I struggled through it. I had more fun reading my high school chemistry book than this mess! I deserve an award for sheer will power. This book is so horribly written, I think my brain cells yelled DOUBLE CRAP before combusting. One brain cell threatened me, \\" If I read another `flush' `gasp' `blush' `biting lip' I am going to commit suicide.\\" The suicide metamorphosed into a genocide. Double Crap! I thought Twilight was a torturous read! This book makes Twilight look like it's in the same league as To Kill a Mocking Bird. I had to summon Popeye-like willpower not to fling it across the room! Since when did reading become such a chore? If you're anything like me and you hated Twilight, then chances are you're going to want to super glue your eyes shut with this piece of trash.<br /><br />I didn't know it was THAT easy to be a New York Times bestselling author! Yeah, I know sex sells, but I thought good writing was part of the equation. If this book portends the future of books, then I'm giving up reading indefinitely!<br /><br />Of ALL names, the author chose to name her heroine (I use the term loosely here) Anastasia Steele. Oh, the irony!! Anastasia is a regal name and E.L James \\"Ana\\" is so undeserving of the name. She is spineless, unlikable, and downright irritating! Secondly, Ana's surname ought to have been Spineless or Doormat instead of Steele. It would have been more fitting. Ana's resolve, will power is anything but made of steel.<br /><br />Ana is an English Lit graduate and yet she can't speak intelligently. In an interview with Christian Grey, she said, \\"What do you do to chill out?\\" Seriously? For a person who loves Thomas Hardy and other classics and have used words like \\"medulla oblongata\\" quite a few times, the only word she could come out with was \\"chill out?\\"<br /><br />Ms. James has a sadistic streak because she wrote this trash in the first person which means that we (hapless readers) are privy to Ana's inane thoughts, with all the continuous lip biting, subconscious mind, gasping, flushing, more gasping, holy this and that! It's maddening! My subconscious mind threatened to subject me to corporal punishment if I read another repetitive word; that's how BAD and REPETITIVE this book was! With all the constant lip-biting Ana Rose Doormat did, I'm surprised she could kiss, much less talk with bee-stung, swollen lips! And with the constant flushing, I'm surprised she didn't suffer from broken capillaries!<br /><br />I can't decide who's worse: Ana or Christian. While Ana is flat-out annoying and a weakling with zero self-esteem, Christian is domineering, abusive, and irascible. He is the worst male protagonist! Even though the author wrote about his stunning good looks on nearly every single page (we get it! The man is gorgeous! Did Ms. James really feel it was necessary to reiterate it on every single page?!), I couldn't find him attractive. In fact, I was very repulsed by him. What I found bewildering was the fact that Ana didn't find Christian's stalking (yes, stalking. He showed up at her place of work unannounced, he tracked her down using a tracking device when she hung up on him, and he knows her home address -which she hadn't offered) of her mildly creepy, but gave her supposedly good friend Jose the cold treatment for attempting to kiss her. WTF? This reminded me of Bella and the way she treated her friends. Wait - Ana is Bella. A horrible version of her (as if Bella wasn't horrible enough). I guess in the world of Ms. James, stalking and abuse is perfectly fine as long as the man is filthy rich. With Ana, it was lust at the first sight of his girth (wallet; not his \\"down there\\").<br /><br />Ana describes Christian as a control-freak, strange, disturbing, and mercurial. \\"Another mercurial mood swing; it's hard to keep up.\\" \\"Another 180 degree mood swing.\\" Ever since she met him, her emotions have been put through the grinder; she's always crying and questioning her relationship with him - and yet, in spite of all that, she describes him as her \\"literary hero.\\"  Yeah, that's my idea of a literary hero - someone who screws with my head and abuses me till I cry. Screw flowers and hearts, I'm all for anguished cries, baby! Hallmark ought to make a card, \\"Take some Advil, Baby - after I make you cry.\\"<br /><br />My subconscious mind as well as Ana's subconscious mind both agree that Ana is a ho. She accepts lavish gifts (a brand new Audi car, a state of the art laptop). A self-respecting girl wouldn't accept these gifts when she's only known the creep for three weeks!  Plus, I cannot believe that Ana doesn't have an email account in this time and age! My brain cells gasped a thousand gasps! Ms. James wants readers to not only suspend disbelief, but also their intelligence! Speaking of suspension of disbelief, as a woman, there is NO WAY that Ana could orgasm every single time she has sex or whenever Christian says, \\"come for me, baby!\\" (The \\"come for me, baby\\" followed by Ana's orgasm made my subconscious mind roll with laughter while slapping her thigh.) This makes me question whether Ms. James has ever had sex! She's probably overcompensating (with her alter-ego Ana) because she's never had an orgasm in her life!<br /><br />Christian is supposed to be the CEO of a ridiculously successful company and YET he's always chasing after Ana. Always emailing her. Always controlling her. He is always THERE like a badrash that just won't go away (and counting her orgasms! I kid you not)! So it begs the question, when does he have the TIME to run his own company?<br /><br />\\"Do you have a problem with your laptop?\\"<br />I frown as he hands me my degree.<br />\\"No.\\"<br />\\"Then you ARE ignoring my emails?\\"<br /><br />\\"Why haven't you emailed me? Or texted me back?\\" He glares<br />\\"I haven't looked at my computer today or my phone.\\"<br /><br />So, if he's not with her, he's emailing her by the nano-second! Good, God! Give the woman some space! Allow her to breathe! If a creep hounded me like that, I'd deactivate my email account and change my cell number!<br /><br />Bella - I mean Ana, is brimming with self-confliction. Is it any wonder why her breath constantly hitches in her throat? She is terrified of her gorgeous psychopathic boyfriend and yet she describes him as her literary hero; her white knight. \\"\\"I think I love you, and you just see me as a toy.\\" (Memo to Ana: If a guy makes you feel like a toy, then you kick him to the curb.) Ana always used the word \\"threaten\\" whenever Christian promised her a good spanking. \\"My stomach is churning from all the veiled threats.\\" The word \\"threaten\\" doesn't connote feelings of safety and happiness. Perhaps Ana's subconscious mind was dozing off whenever her conscious mind chose to use warning words like \\"threaten.\\"<br /><br />\\"'Please don't hit me,' I whisper, pleading.\\" \\"I don't believe I deserve it Mr Grey, especially after tolerating your unprovoked attack.\\" \\"I'm too frightened to show you any affection in case you flinch or tell me off or worse - beat me?\\" Unprovoked attack? Sounds like rape to me. Ana's language indicates that she's NOT comfortable with being hit, even if it is part of a BDSM relationship. I'm sure people who partake in this sort of lifestyle respect each other's limits and they certainly don't use words like \\"unprovoked attack.\\" And when a girl says no, it means NO! It doesn't mean, coerce her until she cracks underpressure. And the rotten cherry on top of it all would be that Ana hasn't even signed the contract and yet Christian behaves like as though she's already signed it. Manipulating, coercing, and pressuring her. Is Ms. James a man?? Because this is something that only a guy could think of. I am DEEPLLY OFFENDED by all this crap!<br /><br />Where is the love story?? More importantly where is the plot?! Even erotica books have a plot! This book is a combination of soft porn and abuse and it could've been easily condensed (at least to spare readers the horrid writing and abuse). Christian is always admonishing and commanding Ana. \\"Eat!\\" \\"Go to bed!\\"  For the love of God, stand your ground and grow a backbone, woman! Every time Christian coerced, manipulated, and abused Ana, my subconscious mind and I wanted to kick him in the groin repeatedly! (He would've been fifty shades of blue down there - a girl can dream.) She disgusts me; he disgusts me. My gag reflex is simply not strong enough....<br /><br />I am offended that Ms. James would romanticize abuse. I've read reviews where some people have said they wished Christian Grey was real. SERIOUSLY?! Christian Grey is a predator and he made my skin crawl throughout the horrible read (even during the sex scenes. I gasp).I'd rather bathe with scorpions than be in the presence of a sadistic creep! I guess I am the only person who is immune to Christian's extraordinary good looks. I guess my sex hormones and my down there are allergic to jerks (Hooray! My subconscious mind pumps her fist in the air!).<br /><br />My subconscious mind reared its ugly head mid-agonizing read and said, \\"Ms. James has written about your abusive ex.\\" I've once known of a \\"Christian Grey\\" minus the BDSM and wealth. He was controlling, abusive and possessive. I was lucky enough to get away before things spiraled out of control. So please, if you ever meet a Christian Grey, RUN as fast as you can in the opposite direction!<br /><br />Somebody please tellme that this book is part of a focus study to see readers' reaction to unpleasant, offensive material. I cannot believe it is in publication and millions of people are referring to it as the greatest love story! It's an insult to real love stories! Abuse is not love! I repeat: Abuse is not love!<br /><br />I couldn't get into the sex scenes because my \\"down there\\" was depressed by all the juvenile language. My subconscious mind assured me that my down there hasn't turned asexual. Christian is a character that makes me want to join a nunnery, file a restraining order against him, and hire a Hit man to take him out. I don't have a problem with BDSM. I have a problem with the atrocious message of this book! Girls are confusing abuse for love! This book adds insult to injury to anyone who's ever been abused! With common \\"Best Selling\\" themes like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Abuse, is it any wonder why women are tolerating abuse and staying with their abuser.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend this book! I wish I could get my wasted time, money, and IQ points back! I don't know how I'm going to wipe this travesty from my memory bank. Klorox wouldn't be strong enough. I can't gasp, murmur without my brain cells (what's left of them) having a panic attack (poor things). My subconscious mind flushed and kindly suggested self-induced amnesia.<br /><br /> I cringe, gasp, and flush at the thought that they're translating this piece of junk into a movie! Isn't it bad enough that a large segment of the population has been subjected to this horror, now they want to target the non-reading, movie-going segment! I feel sorry for the actress who will play \\"Ana.\\" It's embarrassing to play someone who has a backbone made of pudding! Even Paris Hilton wouldn't agree to a role where she gasps, flushes, blushes, gasps some more every frigging nano-second!<br /><br />I do NOT UNDERSTAND the HYPE! Furthermore, I do NOT understand how people could LIKE/LOVE this poorly-written trash that encourages abuse!! It's inconceivable!! I am very angry and disgusted! I wish I could give this book ZERO stars! SUB-ZERO stars! Shame on Ms. James for glorifying abuse! Shame on the publishers for publishing this abomination! Shame on NYT for labeling this trash as a \\"Best-Seller!\\"<br /><br />The characters are two-dimensional. The writing is horrible. The plot is nonexistent! The message is nothing short of outrageous! Spare your brain cells the suffering and AVOID this book! God have mercy on your brain cells if you do decide to read it.<br /><br />Laters, Baby!<br /><br />P.S: I'm never buying my hubby a silver gray silk tie. And I'm never buying Converse footwear and Twinings tea bags again (and I happened to like both companies)!<br /><br />P.P.S: Ms. James: since you're laughing all the way to the bank with the grossly, undeserved success of this terrible trilogy, I strongly advise you to buy a thesaurus and a book about men that abuse women!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|A bit too much of traditional Hollywood storyline and script. A feel good book that makes smile, but not quite enough substance for my liking.
B004KA9UXO|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the story itself was very gripping and enjoyed each and every character, I would easily have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />The kindle edition however leaves much to be desired, misspelt words (including character names), missing spaces, missing punctuation (often the leading quotation mark for speech was absent), etc.<br />At times this edition detracted from the beauty of this novel.<br /><br />The kindle edition feels like it was generated using an OCR system, I can't think of any other explanation for the poor quality.<br />In general there is little excuse, the digital version should be at least as good as the physical book, however the sf masterworks project is ambitious and so for this I am willing to grant a little leeway.<br /><br />I also wish the included dictionary (explaining foreign words that are used heavily throughout) was easier to access, ideally being used to supplement the kindle's built-in dictionary, however this is a limitation of the kindle rather than the text.<br /><br />Overall I would still recommend this book, and despite all of this, I will be reading the rest of the series in this same format.<br /><br />After reading more about the sf masterworks project I still think that what they are trying to achieve is fantastic.<br />Given the choice between reading Dune on the kindle in it's current state vs reading it in paperback (or worse, not reading at all); I would still pick reading it on the kindle.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|...just glad I didn't pay full price to purchase or see in the movie theater.  It is worth a rental but not anything else in my opinion.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This was a funny, heart warming movie. I found myself singing along with the people in Central Park and rooting for Santa to get his sleigh up and running.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a crazy plot - I read it for hours on end because I was so sucked in. Highly recommend because its so different from anything I've read before and I couldn't put it down.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Compelling visual imagery gives the reader a real sense of what Pi thought, experienced, and believed. The ride trumps the destination in this story.
B000059TFO|4.0|This is a good movie, with decent acting.  Gene Hackman delivers in this powerful portrayal of the civil rights era
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have the original hardcover book and my son read this book because he was fifth grade and it was recommened by all the teachers for this grade. But the book is so fun. I could not put it down! All of the fifth graders love all of this series' so...
1565117808|1.0|I am embarassed that I spent money on this audio book.  Life of Pi is a mixed up story that never finds it way.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it so much that I play it every singil day I love it but ocne you start playing it you can't stop
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The story line and acting are outstanding. Really enjoyed this opening year of the series. Can't wait to get to season 2!
B0049D1TCM|5.0|This product was everything i was hoping it was. Anyone who really likes Nicki Minaj should buy this deluxe edition of her Pink Friday CD. All major hits in my eyes. Amazon did a fantastic job with shipping it and getting it to me on time, when i needed it. Thanks Amazon, for everything you do to ensure great products and shipping.
B008G59IBI|3.0|I was hoping the third and final installment in the series would be a more consistent effort than its predecessors. However, ¡Tré! falls a little short of my already low expectations and delivers--in Billie Joe Armstrong's own words--another \\"mixed bag.\\" The album shines in its more traditional Green Day moments (X-Kid; Sex, Drugs & Violence; Walk Away) as well as a couple of lower-tempo numbers (Drama Queen and The Forgotten). However, the remainder of the collection sounds forced or out of place. Brutal Love is a decent tune, but other than allowing Billie Joe to showcase his vocal range it doesn't do much more than allowing the band to cross \\"recording a stripped-down 50's rock ballad\\" off their check list. Dirty Rotten Bastards was supposed to be a new epic \\"frankensong\\" (à la Jesus of Suburbia or Homecoming) but again, it feels forced and quite frankly I found the Carmen/Toreador-inspired intro chant quite tiring since the first time I heard it.<br /><br />In conclusion, no single album in this ambitious trilogy is as good as the sum of their parts. Setting aside the apparent lack of lyrical focus that much of the collection seems to suffer from, there's enough A-side material that could have easily been compiled into a 14 or 15-track collection that would not only satisfy a wider variety of fans, but it would very likely have sold more consistently.
B0013O123Q|2.0|If you're into violence, brutal sex then you would enjoy this.  Its not what I thought.  I fast forward most of it trying to catch a story line and found a sliver of one.  As I said, its not for me.
B0012YYZYK|3.0|The film is amazing, Led Zeppelin is without a doubt one of the best bands everrrrrr..NOW the product was a big dissapointment, the package and cover suck, I got it faster than I thought and thats a big plus but on the back of the blu-ray it looks like if it was forced into the box or hit against something  :/ a bummer since it was a present for someone, I hope they like it.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I have to admit i am a life long Fan of this Group&this was a personal Christmas Gift 2-Myself.Although i have only had the pleasure of seeing this Band Live one time,but was right after in my opinion their Best album was released 2112.The time machine Blu-ray Live in Cleveland Hands-Down is by far the Best Recorded performance of Rock Music I have ever scene.It is hard to phantom 2-me that these Guys(although 2-Did not age well,We all have are Faults) have become better Musicians!Also after watching this a few times now Neil Peart has got to be the Best Living Drummer Alive Today.The Drum Solo Mid-way thru this Set is worth the Price of this Blu-Ray alone.How could anybody play Drums this Good,makes all other Rock Musicians seem like they are just keeping a beat.Where Neil style of playing will always keep Him Center Stage.I saw an interview Recently with Neil Stated at the end of a Live performance He literally hurts from the Tip of His Nose Down to His Toes,If not He hasn't perform at His Best.Watch this Blu-Ray and You will surely see why.All 3-of these Musician are Gifted performers.the way Getty&Alex change instruments all thru this just blows me away playing each one perfectly.The only fault I can find in this Blu-ray after all these yrs. of singing at a high pitch Getty Voice has suffered. I am willing 2- overlook this,because His Bass playing has gotten better.If Ur a Rush Fan,You need 2-purchase this Blu-Ray Regards True Fan
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I am almost finished and can't put it down at this point.  I enjoyed the Whole series and would recommend it to anyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can hardly put it down... best app I have! Even my kids beg to play... but I wont share!! LOL. I'm addicted to this game (my kids are addicted to watching me play)!!! ROFL
B009JBWOU0|5.0|i have batman begins on vhs,than saw The Dark Knight a few timesbut,than The Dark Knight Rises came out so I had to order the set.Wow Rises is well written,well acted,and a fantastic adventure! Great Set we'll enjoy for years
B006X415GK|5.0|Though the best thing about the Frankie doll series is that she usually has one blue eye and one green eye... this version  everything is gray scale (black and white) including the eyes.. which is still cool and unique. The packaging is of good quality and the doll is very articulate.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I thought the show was great,he battle of vampires versus lichens still rages.action packed and lots of amazing fight scenes,and the addition of their daughter suggests yet another adventure is in the offing
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Original story and good family fun. I always enjoy a story of redemption and family. Seeing the main character turn from evil to caring for his new adopted family was a heartwarming story. Excellent animation quality and many humorous surprises.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After finishing the first two books, I was eager to learn the ending of the saga. (I read all three installments back to back, in two weeks)<br />  After having glued myself to my Kindle every free moment I had during that two week period, I was disappointed in the weak ending of the trilogy.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the story. I loved it from the beginning of The Hunger Games right up until roughly the end of Chapter 10 in Mockingjay.<br />  It just seemed as though the author was rushed into ending the saga, perhaps she missed a deadline, who knows?<br /><br />All in all it was a great trilogy but, for me, it felt as though I had wholeheartedly engrossed myself in a beautiful and intricate fireworks display whose finale turned out to be a big fat dud.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|It was a good book but it didn't end right for me. Maybe the next one will. You can hope
0887307280|5.0|Great book.  I have read it three or four times. This is a must read for anyone starting a business.
B00ARN0WBW|3.0|I am a fan of this particular series. You have to keep in mind that It IS what it is.  A low budget horror movie. You can't expect Academy award material.  Para Norm Act 4 is probably meant to scare high school kids.  I thought I was watching a Goosebumps type film.  I thought Para Norm Act 3 was better as far as scary goes.  I am not saying don't watch it, just dont expect anymore than what it is. Cheese!  It has some creepy parts that are associated with the series as far as the story line goes. There are a couple jump moments, but it could have been done better.
B008I43DYU|4.0|work fine simple and easy like a caculator  da 11 more words requiered so hear they are .two more words..............
B008478VE8|5.0|Not sure how to review this, it is required reading for those interested in evolution. Not the easiest read out there, but explains how Darwin refined his theory. Very grateful that Amazon offered it as a free download.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This movie surpasses the original, by leaps and bounds. It's a must see, for anyone who enjoys not stop action in their movies.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This is one of those relatively rare books which I read everywhere: standing in line at the grocery store, stirring dinner on the stove, at 2 in the morning while everyone slept.  I found the story and characters very compelling and engaging, though some are drawn more thoroughly than others given the small cast.  I did not see the end coming, which is definitely a huge plus in my book.  I love being surprised, and this twist ending gave me just that!  As other reviewers have noted, some portions of the story felt a bit contrived, hence the four stars.  But honestly, I'd read it again despite that minor flaw.  Enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I loved the book Slammed so I purchased Hopeless.  I am really wishing I hadn't.  Ms. Hoover is a talented writer however, I was not expecting to be reading about the sexual abuse of a minor.  I would never have purchased the book had I know this occurred and you read about it in a flashback.  Although it is not described in detail, it is NOT something I want to read about.  I believe readers should be forewarned that sexual abuse of a minor occurs in the book before purchasing the book.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|I am getting too old or something. It was very hard to control on my Kindle. It needed to have remotes. Maybe a child is more apt in playing this, I was not and did not like it
1451695195|4.0|First, I enjoyed this well-written and easy to read book. I believe the author is sincere. Of course, I don't know if what the author recounts is real, but then reality itself is a difficult topic.<br /><br />What I wished the author would have done is to describe the other worlds and dimensions he saw in more detail. What size, color, texture were the orbs? How many were there? What are some examples of exactly what the author learned from these other worldly beings? What was it like to visit other dimensions? So little time was spent relating imagery, thoughts, sounds and memories in a detailed fashion so that the reader could get a sense of what the journey was actually like.<br /><br />In contrast, the biographical information, the descriptions of what transpired in the hospital room, the interpersonal relationships were all laid out in considerable detail. After reading the book, the reader had learned a great deal about the author's family, friends, associates and caregivers.<br /><br />It seems strange that the central journey was described in minimal detail and with broad generalizations. Experiencing unity with the universe must have evoked sensations, colors, emotions and detailed thoughts that could be shared with the reader. Why did a hyper-real reality not inspire vivid descriptions? The only character in the other world we learned anything about was the female angel, and the communications related as having taken place between her and the author were minimal.<br /><br />One final criticism I have would be that the author did not adequately discuss the possibility that the memories of his journey might have been generated before or after the inactivation of his neo-cortex. Even though his recollections indicate much time had transpired, proof of the timeline is obviously not available. In any interpretation, time in the non-material world seemed to be moving much more slowly than time in the hospital room of the material world.<br /><br />I am quite open to the idea that there is life after death. This book, interesting and worthwhile though it is, however, did not offer much in the way of proof. The most unusual aspect of the story, from my point of view, would be the rapid recovery from a seemingly hopeless illness. As for objective proof that something supernatural occurred on another plane of existence, I (not surprisingly) did not find it in this book whether or not it actually occurred.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|When buying from Amazon, they are fast on delivery & I have never had a situation that Amazon would not fix,and I have saved a lot of money while shopping with them.<br /><br />Any problem? They take care of it promptly
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was the only thing I did not like. I did not like it. It was weird<br /><br />Just joking ok
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Pointless movie. Left hanging at the end. Actual thought at the end that now we would see what all the action scenes had been about. Instead it ended and I realized that it had all been a waist of time. Glad I hadn't wasted my money to see it in the theater and really, really wish I had never rented it. A complete waste of my time and money. Tried to watch again since the rental was for 48 hrs. Family fell and asleep 15 mins into the start and I had to turn it off because I couldn't bear to continue watching it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Whether you have a dog, a child, or just an obstacle to overcome you will be delighted to become lost in this easy read! Bravo!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game you can buy new games to play. they could add some better games though. its a good game
B009FZFONO|5.0|This season is really exciting and I can't wait for the next part.  The meeting between Rick and the Governor is going to be epic!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Way better than the movie which I seen before reading this. I can't wait to read the second and third book!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Fun. That's all it is. Creative, very easy to understand, and so funny watching those piggies crash. I mean, who is going to ignore this app. Download it, and give it a try!
B009E3EY38|4.0|Amazing, historical concert.  Incredible performances out of all involved.  Jason fills in exceptionally well.  Of course, Plant can't hit the high notes any more, and it takes him a while to warm up, but god, what a pro.  Lots' of older vocalists tend to sound pathetic their attempts to adjust are pity-inducing, but Plant's arrangements cover well and don't detract from the music.  He knows his limits and manages them well.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars is the sound.  I mean, a multi-channel, modern, DTS recording should be amazing.  But the engineers (read: Paige) elected to mix in way too much crowd noise.  I don't mind a little &#34;ambience&#34; - after all it IS a live recording - but in this case it is too much and is distracting.<br /><br />But, by all means, buy it now!
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I saw this movie in 3D and was not impressed with either the storyline or the 3D visuals.  I have seen all of the Aliens movies and consider the original Alien one of my favorite SciFi movies of all time.  Prometheus has a weak disjointed storyline that was hard to follow and often made little sense.  Example, the head of Weyland Corp., the company owning the spaceship, makes a holographic visit early in the story, I presumed he was dead, and near the middle end he appears on the spaceship and is promptly killed by the giant, resurrected alien/human.  Similarly the Charlize Theron character bickers with the crew early on and then fades into the background and her role becomes unimportant.  Also, the resurrected giant alien, not the monster but the genetically human giant, starts immediately fighting with all the crew members for no apparent reason. Of course there is included the obligatory decapitated, talking android head who saves the day.<br /><br />There was nothing exciting about the 3D effects.  If you see it in 2D you will have not missed anything.<br /><br />In summary, this was a must see movie for me and probably everyone else interested in the Alien series, but it is not one of the better SciFi movies I have seen.  I am glad I saw it.
B001BKM3MQ|3.0|I bought this mostly for the song &#34;Gravity&#34;. But on further listening the rest of the record isn't bad either.  Also has the hit song &#34;Waiting for the world to change&#34;. If that means anything to you.  Mayer is an under-rated blues guitarists and victim of his own bad publicity stunts but that shouldn't stop you from listening to this album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it!! I am already looking forward to rereading it just so I can make sure I have not missed a single thing. The emotions, the journey of Sky and Holder, I felt them through the entire book. Absolutely love this book. Colleen Hoover did an amazing job with this one and I am looking forward to what is coming next.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|The pets are cute and easy to like.  The games and activities are fun to do and they teach that the pets need food, play, and love.
B0063GORYU|3.0|It's pretty good. Can help pass time quickly and is a challenge at times.<br />No No NO No six times.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I put this on the kindle for my grandchildren.  They love it because they really enjoy the &#34;Angry Birds&#34; and &#34;Star Wars&#34; movies.  When you combine the two, you have a winner.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Highly recommended, great series in depth story line not just another horror with guts and gore, keeps you enthral led
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Works fine and saves time opening and closing other apps to make it work. pretty much does a good job of simple editing.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Excellent as described, good quality packaging, arrived outside of posted date but received in good order, help centre great with enquires regarding this
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I got this to help with my conditioning, but needed the mobility section even more than I knew. Just the pinch/floss section was worth the purchase price to me.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I chose this book hopping for something new. . Let me just say this now... If you're looking for hot sex and steamy lust, this is not your book. It's very young and, at times, unrealistic. I liked the idea of the bad boy and bad-ass girl combination. Mostly because I'm sick of the drama that comes with these heroins in romance lately. This was a little violent for what's suppose to be \\"beautiful\\" love. But like I said, it's young and probably very relate-able on that level. Which isn't necessarily a good thing but a matter of fact. I'll read the next book of the series when it comes out to see how these characters develop. Overall it wasn't a waste of money and was a good filler when I had time. I didn't keep my Kindle on the charger 24/7 to read it, but it was sufficient.
B008G59IBI|5.0|BOUGHT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT.  I ASSUME THE PERSON I BOUGHT IT FOR LIKES IT.  IT'S WHAT THEY REQUESTED.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|There are some really good songs on this CD and some not so good ones - but I feel like that is true of most CD's.
B008G59IKO|5.0|bought as a christmas present at the recipient's request.  arrived on expected delivery date.  hope they like it.  appears to be as described on website
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Just listening to the previews of these songs I can understand why some people are disappointed.  All the singing was done during filming and not in a studio.  I think it will make for a great film but not for a great soundtrack.  Too bad, would have been nice for them to record the soundtrack in a studio.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Beat this game about five minutes ago.  It probably took less than three hours and I was going fairly slowly.  Will likely play it at least a few more times, but can't see how it could be more enjoyable than the first playthrough.  After being mesmerized by the experience, including the beautiful sequence going on during the ending credits, I remembered what Roger Ebert infamously stated.  He said that video games can never be art.  When I first heard that quote, I thought there was room for debate even though I personally leaned towards games being very much a form of art.  Now there is no doubt--this game is art and has to be played to be adequately critiqued.  I'm going to quit typing so I can continue enjoying the tingly sense of awe spreading through my body as a result of playing this game (and no mind altering chemicals were consumed!).  Hope you get a chance to enjoy this too.
B006ZZAMWK|1.0|Bought for my daughter for Hannukah, may I say they are legitimate homosexuals. DO NOT BUY THIS STUPID EFFING CD.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Seeing as how I've previously owned this on vhs tape, I would say that I love this film.  Shirley Jones and Robert Preston are two of my favorite musical actors, and seeing &#34;little&#34; Ronny Howard back then is a treat for a fan of his directing skills.  I'm a musical fan and this particular one is a top favorite.  If you're looking for a couple of hours of escapism back to simpler times when the world, and movies, were something the entire family can gather around and have a fun movie night, then this is a great choice.  So get the popcorn ready and sit down for an entertaining family night.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have never read this book until now, and I'm glad that I waited until I was old enough to really understand it. I've been working on reading through the classics, and it couldn't have been a better time to read A Christmas Carol. This book is filled with such wonderful imagery and a very valuable lesson: we can't live only for ourselves. Charles Dickens painted a wonderful tale that I plan on reading over and over again as the years come.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Well, what can a big fan of the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaborations say?  This is Tim's directing at his best and Johnny's interpretation of Barnabas Collins was fun with just enough creepiness thrown in.  I loved this movie, that is if seeing it in the theater three times is any indication.  The entire cast was great.  I'm still a fan of the serial, but if you're looking for the afternoon &#34;soap opera&#34;, well this wouldn't be your cup of tea.  However, if you're looking for laughs with a bit of horror slipped in, look no further.  I'm quite obsessed with this movie, but then again, I'm quite obsessed with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  Take two hours out of your day and check it out.
0812984412|4.0|A feature article in The New Yorker magazine about the making of the film of the novel led me to buy it. It's brilliant in parts, with a bravura display of talent and technique and versatility, so much so that I as I read the first half of the novel I kept telling colleagues at work what a terrific book it was. The New Zealand (well, Chatham Islands) opening of the novel with Adam Ewing's diary was a surprise to me. I loved the Letters from Zedelghem section, and the Terrible Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish - lots of delicious, witty English intellectual naughtiness. The Luisa Rey Mysteries section (an especial favourite) would make a great movie in itself.<br /><br />When I got to the post-apocalyptic section in Hawaii and the far-future sequence, I lost interest and frankly skimmed and flicked through them. The all-hillbilly-style language of the first immediately became grating and the Q&A format of the second was at least useful for helping me to flick through fast. I was happy again with the return of the previous sections.<br /><br />All of that said, I don't know whether the novel adds up to more than the sum of (some of its admittedly brilliant) parts. There are clear indications that the author wishes it to do so, but the thematic delivery didn't happen for me. But what a talented writer! How versatile, and how clever. And what a wonderful ability to bring such seemingly disparate stories so memorably alive in one's head. I am very much looking forward to seeing the movie when it opens in New Zealand. I understand it's a bit different from the novel in some regards, but it's bound to be a wonderful cinematic experience.

B007M45PMU|5.0|This is by far my favorite album of 2012.  Reminiscent of old folk artists like Woody Guthrie, the lyrics are real and authentic.  Their sound is contemporary and the addition of mandolin and violin are a delight to the ears.  The album plays to the emotions as well: we laugh with &#34;Classy Girls&#34;, dance with &#34;Ho Hey&#34;, and cry with &#34;Charlie Boy&#34;.  In my family, this album is enjoyed by two generations of music lovers; I know my dad would have loved it as well.<br />Can't say enough good things about this band's debut album.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|If you read the other two books of the trilogy and are a fan this is a must read.<br /><br />Details of the story are repeated several times and this book could have told the ending<br />with a hundred less pages.<br /><br />The ending of the story ties up all loose ends and makes it worth the read.
0756990629|2.0|Maybe I did not read the fine print, but I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It looks like a very high quality fake. My primary gripe is with the cover. I have owned this book in softcover and the hardcover looks like someone scanned the softcover  and printed it in their back room. The text looks fine and if you are just looking to read the book, nothing more, I am sure it is fine. If that was what I wanted though I would have paid 5 bucks for a softcover. I was looking for something a bit more collectible. Something that would look nice on my bookshelf.

B009P5S11G|4.0|So far, there's only a few songs I like but I had to get the CD because I have all of the others! RIHANNANAVY!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It has a nostalgic feel to it with it's simple graphics and concept but that makes it nice.  No flashy tubes and such even though they could maybe offer that as a 2.0 or something, lol.  It offers A LOT of puzzles before it asks you to pay for more.  With the constant updates, I take a break for a month or two until more puzzles are offered for free. Great mind exercising game.
034580404X|1.0|This is a mess.  Bondage, rape, whips, canes, crap,....It was a blog  that somehow reached epic proportions and got to #1.  YUK!  I am amazed that enough people were sucked in.  Frankly I think it's a terrible effort at plagiarizing Nora Roberts.  Shred it before you read it is my advice.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|OMG! This book was crazy. Crazy Good! It's hard to talk about this book without giving too much away--things that would ruin your reading experience--but I'm going to try. Layken moves from Texas to Michigan, because after he dad's death her mom can no longer afford their home. This was the stupidest thing I'd ever heard until the middle of the book when the truth about the move comes out. Lake isn't looking happy about the move, because it's her senior year and she had to leave the only house she'd ever lived in and the only school she'd ever attended. But her next door neighbor is hot, nice and into poetry. That makes it easier. After their first date, she discovers something that means they cannot be together but will have to see each other. And from this point on the book is an emotional roller coaster. I pretty much read it one sitting. I didn't start it until late night, so I stayed up unitl 3 am.<br />5 stars!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!
B004U52VPS|4.0|I was a bit skeptical when I saw this, I thought \\"oh great, more cheap plastic junk\\" but it is actually really, really fun, better than the app because my daughter (aged 5) and I can play it together. She's not so interested in the formal game (which is a series of challenges worth varying points, with the goal being the first person to 1000 points being the winner) but she enjoys designing devilishly hard structures for us adults to knock down. She's surprisingly good at it, which means we are genuinely challenged and enjoy trying to beat her designs. I still think it's a little overpriced for the contents of the box but it is well made and designed, the pieces are attractive and durable and the amount of play value makes it worth it. If her interest in it keeps up, I will buy at least one of the other sets to give it more variety and opportunity to create larger structures.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Okay, first of all--high school kids. You can't add adult content and call something NA when it's YA. I love Colleen Hoover. Her last two books were unbelievable and labeled as YA even though they were college kids. So these high school kids are not NA, sorry. But I'm not sure I think anything about this is YA either.There is nothing technically wrong with this book. It has a well developed plot, believable characters(although they handle things really well and maturely for YA or \\"NA\\"), and it's well crafted. However, the first 1/3 of the book handles sex very casually. When you find out what you need to know about the MC it makes sense, but it doesn't change after that. At one point, I was willing to give the sex a pass, because some of it matters to the story. However, it doesn't end there. And I really didn't like that the birth control conversation comes up after the fact. Little late, don't you think?<br /><br />Other problems--Holder. He cusses a lot and annoyed the hell out of me (cussing aside). THAT BLURB.  While I was reading the book, I kept thinking yeah, I don't remember this on the synop. I wouldn't have bought this book. I've re-read it after reading the book, and I can see how if you summarized the book as vaguely as possible you might get here. This book deals with sexual abuse of a minor. I'm not saying it shouldn't be dealt with. It should. I'm just saying if you write a book about sexual abuse, admit it. Defrauding your readers by glossing over things is not going to do you any favors. I was a die hard fan before this book, and now I will seriously think twice before I read the author again. Not because she's a bad writer, she's a wonderful writer. But I don't want to buy a shady romance about a girl who finds out her bf isn't who he says he is only to learn I have a book about a girl who's past isn't what she thinks it is. 3 stars unless you're into this kind of thing, but for most of the ppl who follow this blog, I can't recommend this read.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|The kids really enjoyed this movie. Mom and dad liked it too! Good movie for the family or the kids.
B00470TOV0|5.0|A film that I believe set ridley scott as the best director of the tewntyith and 21 century. The revolutionary ways he films the action combined with a true shakespearean style story telling leads to an epic that raised the bar back up again for modern films.
B0055EDCGU|5.0|This album is just, INCREDIBLE! Capsizing the sea is an epic intro to the album and when it transitions to the title track you cant help but headbang. Dusk Dismantled is the most brutal song I ever heard, as soon as you hear it you'll be cranking up that volume. Watch the World Burn is a very catchy song with an awesome chorus. Black has some of the most awesome riffs ever. Built to Fall is just an amazing song all the way through. Trust me, buy this cd, its awesome.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I got angry birds for my grandkids and they still play even after they found new games to play.  I would say this is a good game to start with.

B009VB97EY|1.0|I rented this by mistake, and man, what a mistake!  Talk about a movie about boring people who have insignificant lives doing boring things.  I lasted five minutes, so this is the equivalent of walking out on a picture.<br /><br />Don't bother.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|One word,  &#34;CLASSIC&#34;. And, since I have to add more words to review to get it published, add &#34;Trains, Planes and Automobiles&#34; to your HOLIDAY-MUST-SEE-LIST
B009JZVT70|5.0|This series is really fun and is a nice mx of the classic tales and characters with much more depth.
1400031567|4.0|I got interested in his novels from the Swedish Wallendar series on Netflix ( not the British version, which I heard was also very good).  Can be a little slow but it a pleasant change of pace from our American stuff that has gotten lost at times in the need to provide &#34;sex, drugs and rock-and-roll.&#34;  I also like the insight into another culture's way of life and values.  When I first read, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo, I assumed Sweden's biggest problem was having too many beautiful blonds.  I was clueless about their Skin Heads and Neo Nazis left over form WWII.  A similar joy in this area was reading &#34;Out Stealing Horses&#34; that showed how the average citizen might have been impacted by WWII when growing up . . . not just the tank battles, etc. that Americans like to see.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have watched it every Xmas season to lower my false expectations that this season has in our country. This is the Xmas from Hell and yet with Chevy stumbling along in Blind Faith in the Universe, it actually turns out.  When he puts on his hockey mask half way thru the movie and takes out his chain saw to get ..... another tree . . . his interaction with his Yuppie neighbor is priceless ( you will recongnize Elaine from Seinfield).  Great cast and comic timing from the opening scene with the kids to the Buster Keaton ending.  At the conclusion, you can only say: Yeah, my Christmas was pretty smooth last year . . . not matter what drama you had felt had ruined your holidays.  What a cast of characters!!!
B0060D123K|4.0|This Amazon Instant Video [purchased December 22, 2012] includes \\"With a Grateful Prayer and a Thankful Heart,\\" but does not include \\"When Love Is Gone.\\" This version was released in 1992 and runs 1 hour 26 minutes. The 1938 Reginald Owen version does not include the scene where Belle learns that Ebeneezer loves money more than her, then calls off their engagement. The 1951 Alastair Sim version depicts Ebeneezer's former fiancee as working with the homeless during the present Christmas time.<br />  My family and I watched The Muppet Christmas Carol on VHS when it was first distributed. We enjoy the Instant Video version, too.<br />  It includes \\"The Love We Found.\\"  At the movie's conclusion Ebeneezer echoes and expands Tiny Tim's \\"God bless us,\\" to \\"God bless us everyone.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Nice story Mr. Dickens\\"<br />  \\"Oh, thanks. If you liked this, you should read the book.\\"
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I like the mysteries in this book. It keeps a person guessing.  I recommend this book to people that enjoy surprising endings.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A Christmas Classic. This is a must have for any Christmas movie collection.  Everyrime I watch this movie it's like the first time all over again.
B00979CS50|1.0|Huge fan of the Man.  Songs like 'Thrasher', 'Pocahontas', 'You and Me' are beautiful beyond words.  The soundtrack to 'Dead Man' is nothing short of remarkable.<br /><br />This, I don't get.  Sounds like someone drowning a sack of cats.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's very entertaining and the price was right. I didn't realize I could play games on my kindle. I will look for more games.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I see a lot of complaints that this album isn't like the older Killers' stuff. But sound should never be stagnant. Musicians mature and evolve, and this album reflects just that. Brandon Flowers' voice and the band shine here. The mood is sometimes mellow and reflective, sometimes playful. This is an album I will never tire of.
B009KHCRVO|4.0|I enjoyed the humour in the film, and thought that the FX were very well done. A worthwhile watch if you keep an open mind.

B009MF56GC|3.0|Let's be honest, if you've picked or are thinking of picking this movie, you know what you are getting into.  It's all your favourite action stars from the last 3 decades (with a preference for the 80's), including a few more than were in the last Expendables movie.. Chuck Norris and Jean Claude van Damme join the melee this time round.  It's a mindless plot revolving around mindless violence, with van Damme in particular clearly enjoying himself as the (thoroughly) bad guy, whose henchmen have as inexplicably poor aim with their assault weapons as Stallones team have perfect aim every time with their pistols / machine guns / knives / knuckle dusters.  Stallone has passed the directing reigns to Simon West (Con Air) which is an improvement pace-wise on the first, but although the ludicrous action with all those familiar faces is a blast (`scuse the pun) for those who grew up on 80's movies, the movie suffers more than a little from having just too many characters to deal with.  This means Chuck Norris appears as a passing self deprecating type joke rather than a character, and it's odd having Jet Li above the titles when in fact he is in a blink and you'll miss him role.  On the plus side - more Willis and Schwarzenegger is entertaining , even if the wisecracks are somewhat overegged, and the Stallone - Statham duo at the heart of it all still works well, as well as the newcomer Nan Yu and also Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games) in an important role.  Scores if not hundreds of bad guys are killed in outrageously bloody and noisy scenes, and it's all done tongue in cheek.<br />Do I seem half hearted about it - well, there's this nagging feeling that with a decent script and maybe half the cast there could have been a really much leaner more entertaining movie here.  People often say that movies aren't as good as they used to be - but when you see a movie knowingly riffing on 80's movies, you can't help thinking that movies ARE in fact better than they used to be.  Having said that, it's just plain old fun seeing these guys on the big screen, and if expendables 3 comes along then I'm not going to pretend I won't end up watching that too...
B003B02OOG|4.0|This is no deep literature by any standard.  However, I admire this virtuoso of an author for his smooth prose, ability to capture your interest, amuse, and overall make you enyoy reading for entertainment.  I like and admire Philip Roth, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan, Cormac McCarthy and other heavyweights, but I will keep visiting Grisham no matter what.

B0059XTU1S|2.0|I went to this movie with the greatest of hopes.  Our family has been the greatest Tolkien fans, and have admired all the books and the adaptation that Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  So with that in mind, and the positive attitude that we had going in to the movie, that fact that I am only giving it two stars should say alot.<br /><br />Jackson totally overplayed any action scenes and pushed reality to nonsense.  It would be simply impossible to fall hundreds of feet hitting rock sufaces and still survive, and yet these drwaves do this over and over.  Bridges perfectly swing to and fro to rescue them from danger in what could never happen in reality, heavy items (6000 pound troll?) seemingly do not crush them, and when Thorin is crushed in the jaws of a horrible warg/wolf, he doesn't die.  Of course.  The action scenes were so overwhelming and unbelievable they became boring.  Enough already.<br /><br />Jackson took so many liberties with the story line that it barely resembles the book.  The dialogues are entirely different - it is barely recognizable except for the names of the characters and the places they visit, such as the Shire, Rivendell (Imladris), the Lonley Mountain in the distance.  I felt that Jackson must have quite some superiority to think that he could make the story better than Tolkien, who is arguably one of the best story tellers of the last century.  Jackson, a little humility may have helped you make a better movie.<br /><br />Then there is the revolting aspect to the movie.  Yes, revolting.  Not content with the hideousness of the orcs and goblins in the last film, he had to make them even worse.  Since the goblin scenes make up such a huge portion of the movie, it was disgusting to look at these disfigured beings for hours.  The Pale Goblin, has a metal spear protruding through his arm as his \\"prosthethic.\\"  So that wasn't gross enough?  In a B style movie maneuver, Jackson resorts to sophomorish ways to get laughter -you guessed it, SNOT.  A twenty foot long thread of snot ejected onto Bilbo.  For the rest of the movie (about half?) we get to see this become encrusted and dryed on Bilbo's clothing.  Still not suffienctly disgusted?  How about bird excrement running down Radagast's hair, face, and beard as a permanent adornment.  Tolkien depicted Radagast as a unique, solitary individual.  Jackson made him fit for an insane assylum.  Radagast is pulled around on a sled towed by obliging rabbits, whose combined weight would not equal the wizard's weight.  Despite this, these rabbits also had the ability to out run warg wolves.  Totally unrealistic.<br /><br />Jackson made the dwarves look ridiculous.  Other than three that looked presentable and rather swashbuckling, the rest had excessive and bizarre use of braids, one that coiled around his head looking like brains, one sported a hat that had exagerated points to each side.  I think Jackson would have gotten further with more moderation in their costumes.  He made them look buffoonish, ignorant, slovenly.  At the house of Elrond, they disparaged the food, and were utterly rude.<br /><br />While we are at the House of Elrond in Imladris, I want to point out that Hugo Weaving was one of the few charaters that made the movie tolerable, and unfortunately his parts are very brief.  He looks impressive, strong, and masculine riding in on a stunning horse.  In Rivendell, the book talks of great banqueting and even better storytelling and music.  None of that is shown in the movie, with only a brief scene with an elve playing an artificial harp in the background.  Well, I play harp, and that was bogus.  The elve is not really playing the harp at all, just strumming her fingers back and forth totally out of sinc with the harp music.  Stupid.  With great harp musicians like Loreena McKennit and Deborah Henson Conant, Jackson couldn't have found ONE person who could really play a harp in the House of Elrond?  He'll have thousands of littleskulls built for a twenty second scene, but he can't find a real harp and a real harpist?  Please, Peter, we are not stupid!<br /><br />I am so glad this movie was rated PG-13 since there is some serious nightmare influencing material in it, and if you have smaller children I strongly recommend that you not take them.  While it is rated PG-13 I know that New Line is heavily marketing to the younger crowd.  Let's face it, how many teenages play with Legos, some but not alot, and they are heavily marketing toys like those for the 7 and up audience.<br /><br />I do not hold out any hope for the next two movies since so many liberties were already taken with the plot and characters in this one.  The grotesque elements are not worth enduring again.  We will not be going to the next two films when they come out.  I would rather preserve the images in my mind from the books, and not have Jackson's distorted depiction ruin it.

159420411X|1.0|I perform business forecasts in my consulting firm and had a friend call and say I absolutely had to read this because of my line of work. From the business context it was really very disappointing. I wouldn't really call it a business book. I would say if you are a college graduate and have taken a couple of business courses most of this is intuitive. If you are involved at all in this line of work you won't miss anything by not reading it. I got the Kindle version and read it entirely on one two hour plane trip.<br /><br />Having said that, there are a number of stories (long, long stories) that eventually, sometimes make a point so if you are interested in esoterica, then this is the redeeming element. I think if you put the actual applied content together you might have 10 pages, maybe.<br /><br />I suppose I wouldn't be so down on the book if so many people weren't saying this was a fabulous book. It simply isn't and in my line of work I'm disappointed to see the press jumping up and down about it. It strikes me as a lot of money put into marketing it, and it appears to be working.

1451695195|1.0|Neither special nor enlightening. Recieved this book as a gift and after reading it in one sitting I must agree with many other single star reviews as to the failing particulars. Rather than rehash what has been described and said adequately prior, \\"Disappointing\\" sums it up for this reader. Happy this book was not a purchase.<br />As shallow as this unfolding story was in revealing the author's self-proclaimed \\"one-of-a-kind\\" NDE and annoyed by on-going instances of poor editing, the cosmic mystery is, How the doctor aquired an agent and contract with industry stalwart Simon & Schuster to publish this tale?

B002M5E2DW|4.0|I like the idea of this book.  The idea of the Law of Attraction, and I am a firm believer in it.  I believe the Bible teaches basically the same thing with &#34;The words of your mouth&#34;.<br />The CDs make this kind of cheesy and too dramatic.  the speakers are really good, but Rhonda Byrne (if that is who narrates this), is a bit to magical, mystical, and dramatic.  I would almost feel foolish if someone else heard me listening to it.<br />Good way of thinking though.  Definitely worth a listen or a read.

1577312082|2.0|There is nothing new under the sun-- but most especially in regard to this somber, humorless and cryptic exercise in shameless self-serving capitalism by a  (OK-the NY Times knows that he can sell books ) 21st Century Guru Maharaji. My 60+ year old peers will remember this reference to a certain 15-year old \\"Perfect Master\\" who sold enlightenment as readily as he bought Rolex watches.<br /><br />If you want to hear this very same universal revelation from a real deal Guru/California PhD, buy a copy of \\"BE HERE NOW\\" published in 1971 by Baba Ram Dass (AKA Dr. Richard Alpert).<br /><br />BE HERE NOW originally sold for $3.33. I have my original copy and cherish it as one would a family bible. The difference? Ram Dass is honest, light, hip and loves you. Eckhart's pain and suffering sounds clinical and  treatable - a textbook example of Major Depression. Frankly, I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes of his $35 \\"audio book\\" without cringing. He sounds like a middle-aged \\"emmo\\"  in dire need of antidepressant therapy. I am truly glad that he had his \\"revelation\\"; he was assuredly unemployable before waking up to his real calling- a media savvy huckster.<br /><br />I don't care where or how you \\"wake up\\" to the reality of existence. There is nothing new about \\"The Power of Now\\". Nevertheless, to quote my California Guru, \\"You can't rip the skin off a snake--it has to fall off when the time is right\\".<br /><br />I most sincerely hope that you are ready to HEAR and AWAKEN, and not just BUY a quick fix to the unavoidable suffering that is called LIFE.
B00ANT6OK8|2.0|\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" begins with some of the haunting emergency calls during the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and then follows Maya (Jessica Chastain) as she dedicates ten years of her life towards finding and killing Osama bin Laden. It's an extremely tough and nearly impossible uphill battle for Maya as everyone around her thinks she's chasing something she'll never be able to find until it all pays off in May of 2011. The awards buzz and word of mouth surrounding this film is really misleading though as \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is already well on its way to being the most over hyped film of the year, which doesn't seem too far off since \\"The Hurt Locker\\" was treated the same way.<br /><br />Between all of the yelling, the frustration of leads becoming dead ends, and the sorrow of friends and co-workers dying on the field supporting the cause is this constant string of torturing, interrogating, and things exploding. This is a pretty dead-on description of the first half of the film, but just throw in a little bit of good cop/bad cop and trying to take pictures of one man in a white SUV in a crowd of people and you'll have everything covered. Maybe sitting through that Nick Berg beheading video back in college soured torture scenes on films based on actual events, but these types of scenes, despite being done really well, don't really leave you feeling satisfied. It's very peculiar because watching a horror movie with tons of blood, torture, and gore can be ridiculously fun, but add that factor to terrorist events that actually happened and suddenly the fun is sucked completely out of it. It's not that a film is automatically terrible because it decides to go this route, but why would you want to sit through something like this when you already followed something similar in real life and don't really have any enjoyment in it?<br /><br />The formula involving yelling, excitement, and any sort of object being blown up should end with you having a good time. So why does it feel so boring here? The explosion at the beginning of \\"Children of Men\\" intrigued you and prepared you for one hell of a film. In \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" it seems to only bridge the gap between one possible dead-end lead to another with little results.<br /><br />This film has something in common with \\"On the Road\\" in the sense that they have an endless amount of talent in its supporting cast, but every actor basically comes in, does something extremely miniscule or only has a handful of lines, and then is never seen again. Aside from Jason Clarke (\\"Lawless\\"), nobody really does much of anything; Scott Adkins (\\"The Expendables 2\\"), Mark Strong (\\"Sherlock Holmes\\"), Mark Duplass (\\"Safety Not Guaranteed\\"), and Frank Grillo (\\"The Grey\\") all disappear in the blink of an eye. James Gandolfini waddled into \\"Killing Them Softly,\\" but his character turned out to be completely irrelevant. Gandolfini manages to be just as insignificant in \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" as he only drops a few F-bombs before walking out a door and is never seen again. If you're an actor trying to make a name for yourself or are on the cusp of breaking into the mainstream, then it makes sense to take a small role in a film like this to help get your name and face out there. But it leaves you scratching your head when it comes to actors who are already well-established. Did they get a huge paycheck? Did they just jump at the opportunity to work with the people involved or have an insane amount of respect for the film?<br /><br />Many may expect Joel Edgerton (\\"Warrior\\") to have a meaty supporting role, but he doesn't show up until about the halfway point and you only hear from him sparingly. Chris Pratt (\\"The Five-Year Engagement\\") is one of the only grunts around long enough to have a little bit of personality shine through. Coming back around to Jason Clarke, the odd thing is that the only thing you'll really remember about his character is that he likes to torture people even though he's around for the majority of the film. He does stick up for Maya on at least one occasion, so he does come in handy. This is very much Jessica Chastain's film though. You watch Maya evolve throughout the film starting as an amateur who cringes at the site of torture and eventually kind of becomes a monster where nothing fazes her and she won't stop until she gets what she wants. Chastain's performance is passionate, driven, and obsessed, but she's also a cold-hearted spitfire which makes it difficult to really care about her character.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is completely overvalued by nearly everyone who's seen it. Some are comparing it to \\"Argo,\\" but these are two completely different films. \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is much darker and grittier, but the one value they share in common is that they're both being blown out of proportion. Jessica Chastain does an incredible job of carrying the film on her shoulders, but unfortunately it isn't enough to make this worthwhile. With a protagonist you lack the desire to root for and subject matter that's been shoved down our throats in the 11 years since 9/11, \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is one of the only films this year where battling heavy eyelids is more exciting than the film itself.'s around for the majority of the film.

B004ZN9J0K|4.0|Their are so many great songs on this. \\"Let their be more light\\" really show where they would eventually end up using probably some of the simpler instruments to create a real Psycadellic Sound. You really have to credit all of them for no one really dominates the band. Remember A Day is a typical 60's song that really is appealing. Set the Controls again shows the mood creating story telling adventure. You just cannot say enough about the underrated Mason on drums.  Saucerful of Secrets again takes you into another world of adventure. A really great band before success.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Saw this in IMAX 3D at the midnight showing. DO NOT USE TINTED 3D GLASSES when viewing this movie, tried to watch this on my friend's 70 inch flat screen in 3D needless to say we could not see the details that make the movie wonderful. So far this is the best new movie I have seen this year.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Just as good as the life aquatic. A must see movie if you are a Bill Murry or Bruce Willis fan
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I tried to read it, but found it so childish and repetitive I simply couldn't get into it. What I did find though is that the bad reviews are far more entertaining than the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend them  ***** 5 stars.<br /><br />But success can't be denied, she's made a bundle.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I am 28 years old and I really love to read this series. It's entertaining and I absolutely love the movies too...
B003K8MI4K|5.0|I loved this season- it's my favorite. David Tennant is amazing as the Doctor, capturing both the erratic behavior that surely MUST come with being a constant time traveler, and the weariness of one who has lived to see ages pass and worlds end. He seems able to generate chemistry with nearly any actor or actress (though in the interest of full disclosure, it always seemed a tad lacking with 'Martha', played by Freema Agyeman). Specifically, the chemistry between Tennant and Billie Piper as 'Rose', and Catherine Tate as 'Donna' is a treat to watch.<br /><br />Speaking of 'treats', Catherine Tate herself is exquisite as Donna Noble. She plays the perfect mixture of silly and serious, wide-eyed and bored, sensitive and bossy. Scenes like \\"I just want a mate\\" are hilarious enough to have to pause the show for laughter, while the scene in Episode 13, \\"Journey's End\\", where she is forced to realize that she's going home, seem capable of tearing the heart out. It was a fantastic adventure just to watch the Doctor and Donna- DoctorDonna- form a bond not unlike siblings. Having not seen Season 7 yet, I hope to see more of Donna in the future.<br /><br />It was also very much enjoyable to see the companions come together in the last few episodes. The actors work so well together, and it's always nice to see Mickey (Noel Clarke), whose character has gone from shivering \\"Damsel in Distress\\", to \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\". I find it's possible to wish well on fictional characters, and Mickey is proof. =)<br /><br />I didn't discover Doctor Who until the past few months, and when I saw the first episode, I had honestly decided not to watch any more, thinking it just wasn't \\"my cup of tea\\". I was convinced by a friend to keep with it, and I am so glad that I have. It has quickly become one of my favorite shows. I hope if anyone else is reading this review who hasn't watched it gives it a go. It may not be your type of show. On the other hand, you may find it to be something special.<br /><br />Rae<br /><br />To add -and feel free to call me a foolish and hopeless romantic- I have found few cinematic experiences quite so pleasing and fulfilling as the single moment when I realized that Rose got to keep a Doctor.
B000FA57US|5.0|Much like Halloween 2 is a direct continuation of the first film, this one serves as an immediate continuation of Halloween 4. This film focuses less on Michael Myers and more on the character of Jamie, Michael's niece. It is a good film that often gets a bad rap as one of the worse sequels in the series, but let's get real here. The films stopped being good after this one was made. However, H20, the film that featured the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, is a fine film, but it ignores the events of this story. This one is a worthy purchase for any horror fan or Halloween fan.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|Ms Anna Wintour is truly a leader.  She takes her position very seriously and we should all thank her for that.  The top designers respect her opinion which means she knows her job very well. She knows what sells and what doesn't sell. She seems tough with her employees but I see it as her trying to bring out the best in people.  That is a great sign of leadership. If her employees don't appreciate it, maybe they should move out of the way and let the ones that want to work hard and learn, under Ms Wintour's guidance.  After watching this DVD (in early September), I ran out and bought the Vogue September issue magazine.  Wow, it is huge, over 900 pages with great fashion ideas.  I'm hooked on Vogue now.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are really talented.  Their arrangements are amazing.  I'm looking forward to their next album  and love watching their you tube channel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I travel quite a bit for work so Im always checking the weather so I know how to pack.  This app is great I use it on my kindle fire and have no regrets. The weather app I use on my laptop drives me crazy. I think it's yahoo''s weather app. It takes forever to load completely (not so with this app) &amp; even though it's suppose to show my favorites or the places I've recently checked, It's a toss up on whether or not they will even show up. I''ve had none of those problems with AccuWeather. It runs perfectly. I highly reccomend it if you want to know what's going on outside.
0736092269|5.0|I bought this for my best friend.  He loves it!  The explanations, the male and female muscular and ligament photos...just great.  I'd suggest this for anyone thinking about getting into strength training as it will show you how to do so safely and efficiently for maximum results.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Original and well written. The author succeeds in keeping you interested right to the end. Hope for more to follow.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Suspenseful, smart, well written, EXCELLENT cast and production.  Looking forward to many more seasons to come with Emily leading the way!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This has to be the most heartwarming movie. Much better than the remake. I'd recommend it anytime to any age persons.
B0079R8KXG|1.0|What was advertised is not what I got, they posted it to fit a kindle hd and it's to small...
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Tarantino is a mastercraftsman and this is my second favorite film by him right behind pulp fiction, his masteriece. This movie has great dialogue and very memorable acting by brad pitt.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book Jeff Kinney I loved the candy gram thing were doing that at our school but with candy canes
B001706I5I|5.0|This was our first experience with Amazon movie rentals, and the quality (HD) was the best ever!  I'll be coming back.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is fun for young and old alike. Challenging and entertaining. This is similar to tetrus but with some fun twists.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|E L James really needs to give up writing sex books. After reading the other two, and giving them both one star for crappy writing skills during the sex scenes, I have to give this book a good review. The author ended the story nicely and there were hardly any sex scenes in this novel, so it was an easy read.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I find this app very similar to pokemon, which is what I like about it! the sounds are adorable,  but the animals could be cuter...that's really my only co.mplaint
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This has got to be the worst written drivel I've read since I was ten.<br />...there! I said it.<br />on the upside;<br />The characters are mildly entertaining, if you can get past the grammar.
B008LSVLGU|5.0|There is a mistake. The photo mentions \\"Eighteen Classic Albums\\", the description \\"Eight Classic Albums\\" (correct title is \\"Eighteen Classic Albums).<br />In fact there is also an import only four CD set (titled \\"Eight Classic Albums\\") featuring eight albums from the Jazz legend:<br />A New Sound, A New Star Vol 1, The Sounds Of Jimmy Smith, A New Sound, A New Star Vol 2, A Date With Jimmy Smith Vol 1, The Incredible Jimmy Smith At The Organ Vol 3, At the Club Baby Grand Vol 1, At the Club Baby Grand Vol 2, and A Date With Jimmy Smith Vol 2. (44 songs).
B007IXWKUK|1.0|It's just those sex scenes. The whole reason I read this trilogy was for the sex scenes. I was so badly disappointed with the writing in first book that I really just shouldn't have read this one. It's like ever sex scene is a carbon copy of the last one, even the ones in the playroom. This novel also played around with two or three different plots but never really brought us to climax. If this was the author's intention, they did a fine job.<br />I will have to say that if you can get through these two books and on to the third one, at least you'll find release.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The good about this movie?  Charlize Theron.  She rocked, chewed and gnawed on every scene with great veracity.  She was an awesome mean villain!  The dark cinematography is beautiful and imaginative.  The Huntsman is brooding and rugged switching sides from the Wicked Queen and siding with Snow White.  Kristen Stewart was lacking in depth in this and totally miscast.  Her monologue to the soldiers was painful and showed that she is not a natural actor, but one that was trained.  It's the Wicked Queen and the Huntsman that shine here.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|The DVD is Great I enjoyed watching them guys again. Age didn't hurt them at all. Jason did a good job filling his Dads shoes.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Novel was written rather simplistically, explaining Harry's thoughts behind his every move (i.e., Harry knew that if he didn't do this, blah blah blah).  I'm a big fan of the Harry Bosch series and this one was a disappointment.  It's plot was predictable and its writing style contrived and juvenile.  Not Michael Connelly's best work.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Funny and entertaining.. My kids love this movie. They watch it every Christmas ! I recommend it to all .
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Having been a fan of the original, I was unsure about being able to view this objectively. However, the setting is different enough from the original that if you've seen the classic, you won't get too caught up in waiting for your favorite lines or scenes. For me, this version misses the mark on certain levels. It's more interested in being a CGI/action flick than an interesting story. There's no dramatic payoff for any of the characters here. There are tense/anxious moments, but those are driven more by the action than informed by any internal conflicts the characters have (although Kate Beckinsale does walk around looking stern for most of the movie). And for me, losing the Mars storyline removes the sci-fi heart of the story. This story has no heart. It tries to be post-apocalyptic in some weird sense, where there's a lot of scenes that look more like they belong to an updated Blade Runner than Total Recall. It does try to be a good action thriller, but just having great CGI effects and some good action scenes doesn't make a movie. Maybe for some people it does, but it doesn't work for me. I wouldn't say I hated it, but I can't say I liked it either.
193413712X|5.0|Tinkers by Paul Harding is a simple story, yet an excellent read. The book is about a traveling peddler and his reflections during his travels. He reflects about his work, his customers, his products, his horse, and his father. What stand out about the book is his use of language. His iliteration is beautiful and reads like poetry. This is a perfect book to read on a rainy or snowy day in front of a fireplace.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|please please please lower the price because I don't want to get reaped of if this game does not work in my kindle fire so please lower the price oh and put the other one on market please
B00A77II0U|5.0|Thanks<br />Was fun and very entertaining, would buy it again...<br />Awesomeness and clever enough to keep me busy for a few hours.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|this game is a piece of s*** because it is just the same as balloon tower defence 5 so this
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I have been a very jaded reader -- no historical novels, no trashy paperbacks, no romance/adventure novels.  Life was too important to waste it reading these types of things.  This was a book club read, so I felt obligated.  All I can say is: Thank heavens for feeling obligated!  This book grips you, because you are jumping into three (or four) different stories that are seemingly unrelated, but the further you go the more each plot line ensnares you.  Each tendril of story wraps around another tendril, and at the end they unite in a strong, gripping tale.  As the end of the book got closer and closer, I kept wondering how Kate Morton was going to end this!  Until the very end, the she keeps us guessing and trying to solve the 4-generation mystery.
B009ZE27US|1.0|you shuld read the info ok and it says. this is a funny prank do not fey it well it is funny but if you want it. to be really real do not her this

B003O86FMW|5.0|.....Omg...I love this series. Absolutely and completely. I couldn't sleep due to the lack of knowing what's going to happen next. On to book 3
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good read but slow.  Not enough to keep your total interest &  I was hoping for a better ending but very dull.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I give this 3 stars because I finished it.  It was entertaining enough to keep me going, but the lack of attention to details really bugged me.  If you're ready to ENTIRELY shelf your sense of disbelief, you won't have as much of a problem as I did.<br /><br />The 1st book/novella was GREAT, the rest was just a stretched out yarn (no pun intended) from there.  Not much imagination after the first book.<br /><br />(SPOILERS)<br />What got to me was this giant silo, that was 150 levels deep, with each level being 10 feet (from chapter 4 of like the 3rd or 4th book), that took people THREE DAYS to climb.  I can climb a flight of stairs in like 8 seconds, but people in Silo 18 seem to need about 10 minutes.  And the stairway could only fit 2 people abreast (from book 2).  Once you get past the veneer of the setting (people living in a silo), absolutely nothing makes sense.  The ecosystem could never work - pumps continually pumped water from the \\"Deep Down\\" to...where?  Energy comes into the silo and exits via...what?  It was just ridiculous when you start thinking about anything past that first premise of people living in a silo.<br /><br />**Update**<br />Changed to 1 star since I've learned that the author has bought a bunch of 5-star reviews.  Lame.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|clint eastwood and amy adams were at their best. i have to tell you that this movie made my day, no pun intended.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Why aren't the countries of the world doing more to stop these atrocities in North Korea ?? UNBELIEVABLE READ .. stop what you're doing, educate yourself and instead of focusing all our efforts in the Middle East .. do something to free these people and eliminate the work camps .. it's the same as concentration camps, only NOW IN 2012 !! Why doesn't this issue get more press coverage ???
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie was average at best.  The movie had no real plot and I had already seen the funny parts in the commercials.  If you like leftist feminists cartoons, this movie is for you.  If you are a guy who is tired of guy bashing, stir away from this movie.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Nice implementatiin and graphics, but not a mature product. Locks up too often, does not remember sound setting (I always want it mute), and no automatic saving of partially completed bridges for playing later.
B0048Y9TPG|5.0|It also has a bunch of classics.  My wife loves this album (and I find myself listening to it more than I care to admit. )
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I liked the \\"Beat the System' storyline of this book.  Great creativity by John Grisham.  I liked the ending to the book.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I have the demo of the game on my Xbox and I thought it was great (of course) plus I'm a big Sonic fan.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Brilliant combat game. This version is way better than previous versions. Playing this game gave me great expectation for modern combat 5.
0547258305|5.0|I almost shed a tear at the end, because it was the end and I didn't want to leave. This book...how shall I describe it. First, you need to understand that I pick apart the structure of all books, movies, and television shows that I read and watch. I can't help it; it's my Grace. But I don't want to here. I just want to let the story keep washing over me. ..<br /><br />But I have to say that I've not read a story like this before. The plot took a third row seat to the storytelling, and astonishingly you won't give a flying fig about any plot point that comes up or doesn't come up for chapters. The twisty-turny was all about the relationships and character growth, even with the smaller B characters, and some of the C characters. Truly, I should be thumbing my nose up at this plot. It was simplistic and a lot of it happened off stage, but all I cared about was the character D (character development). Cashore took her time over chapters to show character arcs and progression and overcoming of obstacles both internal and external. And it was lovely.<br /><br />A lot of this story happened in the preparation of an act or the aftermath of an act, but my heart would be pounding even though I often didn't witness the actual act on page. How the hell did she do that, I ponder scratching my head? It shouldn't be possible, right? As writers we're supposed to show don't tell and she told a lot, but made it feel like showing. Head scratch again.<br /><br />Both Katsa and Po, and even little Bitterblue are in my top favorite characters of all time. Katsa and Po are easily in the top three. Po would be second to Maggie Steivfater's James in \\"Ballad.\\" But Po's patience and laughter, which just seemed to leap off the page, and his understanding and strength. Oh so yummy. Why can't he be real?!?!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This game is NOT like Order and Chaos.  It has some of the same graphics and concepts of order and chaos, but the two games are very different, in that Heroes of Order and Chaos is more like a pvp castle takeover game.  The graphics are very nice and the control figuration is workable.  Overall this game is very fun to play with, once you get use to it.  :)
0812550706|4.0|Wow...I was not expecting that ending. It was the stuff of mythologies, of urban legend, of scripture. Ender crawled into my heart and I bled for him, I cried for him, I will never forget him. At first I was utterly disturbed by the child abuse, but I couldn't put the book down. So, why the 4 stars instead of 5? Probably my fault. There were parts of this book that just went over my head, parts I didn't get. Like Anderson? Graff made an impression, but I didn't understand Anderson's role? The structure is so different than what we get fed through today's literature. The subplots and how they were woven was like nothing I've ever read in a craft book and I truly thought that Card was just dumping in some words and chapters to allow Ender a moment to grow older. But no. Every scene he wrote had a purpose and closure. In two words, this book was unconventional and brilliant.

I have to say that I alway found people that say they cry when they reed a very emotional stories, a bunch of pathetic losers. Why would you cry over a story that is fictional? I'll tell you why. Because, there are some freakishly brilliant writers out there, who has this ability to write a story that rips your heart out and you left with no other choice, but to ball your eyes out, because it hurts so damn bad.<br />And what do you know, I sat yesterday reading this book til 4 o'clock in the morning, crying like a pathetic loser that I am :-).<br /><br />Heartbreakingly beautiful story which will stay with me for ever...

B0093COK4S|5.0|If you are a Sandra fan, this is a must have CD. She went back to her roots and this album has a very 1980's sound to it, which is a very good thing. All the songs are good and male backup vocals add a really nice touch. I highly recommend this new CD to any Sandra fan.
B0063GORYU|1.0|My older version of Spider was clear and easy to view. This newer version as of Nov 2012 is horrid. Very hard to see cards. Hate it and will delete.

B000W93CHC|4.0|This book brought me into 1332 with all the action,double crossing,sex of 2012.  The characters are good decent people who have the misfortune to deal  everyday with scum and villainy .  It's a page turner.

B00AMBK0X4|3.0|My son has seen both the unrated and rated versions.  He found the rated version funnier.  I found this unrated version a bit over the top, at times.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book started out a bit slow but after a while I didn't want to put it down. I recommend it! Can't wait to see the movie.
B004SIP88Y|4.0|Hero is another story along the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon theme featuring many of the same characters. It is the story of an orphan called nameless who is presented to the emperor of Qin as the man who killed the most notorious assassins in the kingdom. Namely Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow. The story becomes more convoluted as the movie progresses when we discover the hero is not all that he appears. There are some spectacular special effects in the fight scenes. My only dislike was the overuse of coloured filters in one of the fight scenes between the two female leads. Otherwise a great action flick with a really moving ending.
145470246X|5.0|This book from Sabine was highly anticipated as her designs are such unique, intricate marvels and the book, Beaded Fantasies did not disappoint.  I loved it from front cover to the very last page.  I salute this bead master on bended knee, thank you for working so hard to produce such a wonderful bead book.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Too many missions which read about the same.  Would have liked more about his family life, but  all in all---OK

B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I rented this movie and wished I had kept it longer than the rental time allowed. I do like action movies and this certainly is one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!!<br /><br />From the beginning, I thought it would be a little predictable. Boy, was I wrong! This book has twists and turns I never saw coming. The writing was fantastic and the descriptions were amazing. There were portions of the book that I was so involved in I could close my eyes and see the action unfolding.<br /><br />The characters were so full of emotion. Their battles were raw, uncensored and in the end beautiful.<br /><br />I was a fan of Colleen Hoover for Slammed and POR but this takes it to a whole new level! I will be waiting with anticipation for any upcoming books by this fabulous author!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Worth the time to install and not hard to learn. It is a great game for the price (free) and has lots of options!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|my bf and i love this show the way there is always some sort of sexual tension going on between two characters and since the sexual tension has been taking out of the equation for booth and bones but still amazing.
B00400NHRO|4.0|Though I am not a physician, I work with them very closely. I found this book a little bit dated & even far-fetched at times, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was okay. The part of building of strength and coming out of hole for batman seemed rushed, too predictable. Not many twists and turns and layer of complexity as the second part.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app installed just fine on the Kindle fire and is extremely addicting. I couldn't stop playing it when I got it. No problems like with others apps.
B00933JF74|4.0|A very enjoyable game. It keeps me entertained for hours at a time. I highly recommend this game to everyone. There is lots of things to keep you busy.
0307346617|4.0|I didn't realize when I borrowed this from a friend how the book was written or the story was told.  Instead of one point of view, interviews are conducted.  Each interview is someones personal story of what happened to them whether it's before, during or after the attacks.  I really enjoyed this approach, it was different, refreshing and I liked it.  It made for those not so entertaining sections to pass by quickly as each story isn't that long.  If this is your thing, I'd recommend completely giving this a read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game.  It is perfect for little kids that like my little pony, and big kids too.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book, had some interesting twists... I felt like the ending was short or like it was rushed to be finished.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver has become famous for the accuracy of his predictions in the 2008 and 2012 elections, but his book is not (much) about politics. I learned quite a bit about poker, climate change, weather forecasts, earthquakes, and the frequency of terrorist attacks in the course of Nate's discussions of data, predictions, and Bayesian statistics. An easier read than you might expect - it moves quickly.
1594744769|2.0|At first this book seemed interesting, I couldn't let go of it, but about half way through the book I began to realize that this book was an awfully obvious attempt to imitate the Harry Potter series. At a certain point, the author doesn't even try to hide this anymore...At that point I simply stopped reading and moved on to some better literature. not recommended!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is one of the better relaxing sounds apps I've tried. I love the fact the sounds are realistic to what they're supposed to be (not tinny and fake synthesized sounding). It's also great that with it you can be an aural &quot;chef&quot; - layering different sounds to create your own relaxing sound recipe. The base variety of sounds - even before custom blending - is good and the app interface is intuitive.<br /><br />The app lets you pause and resume. And raise or lower the volume to suit your needs and tastes. Unlike some competitive offerings, this app doesn't blare sound. To me, the intuitive approach is for a relaxing sounds app not to blast out sounds. So this app is just right!<br /><br />In addition to the melodies there is a blog that you can access to pick up relaxation and stress-busting tips. After getting wound around the axle with some of the stress causing tech glitches and &quot;challenges&quot; in the Kindle Fire HD I think I will be able to make good use of the blog...<br /><br />For those who need constant stimulation and variety there is an upgrade path from the free version. Ipnos offers a premium paid version with more sounds. Because I'm using the free version and love it I haven't checked out how many sounds or if there are additional features such as timers or alarms. But I am quite content with the free version for my situation and uses.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I think this game is pretty cool regardless of what everyone else thinks.  I do agree that there should be more realistic looking people and more &quot;tools&quot; though.<br />You know what I think is stupid?  That you're supposed to be 13 to make a review.  I'm only 11.
1612931103|4.0|This book was purchased to be sent to a slum school in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya as a resource for the school native teachers where it is used to teach English (the primary language of Kenya) to students preparing for their entrance exams to a secondary school. One aspect of the qualification to further education in the secondary and university schools system is the ability to write &#34;good&#34; English. I have used this book in my career in communications and consider it the &#34;bible&#34; of written English.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I think this game can be challenging but it is always fun  no matter how hard it is.  I found &quot;buckets and bunnies&quot; or whatever very hard.  I love Draw a Stick-man Epic!
B009329ZF2|3.0|Hey, it's a movie based on a game. What do you expect?<br />Although the references to the original game were amusing.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I love Woody Allen movies and this one is no exception, it has an intricate story with a twisty plot and it also has great pictures, Paris is a lovely backdrop !
0307591549|5.0|I saw Shawn's presentation at the 2012 Nerium Fall Bash in Anaheim in November, which is why I purchased this book. It presents very detailed research information in a casual writing style that anyone of any age could understand and enjoy. I highly recommend this book if you are ready to improve your outlook on life.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Zombies ... need I say more?! It's kind of an old story line but the graphics are so much better.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Great duets! A really nice selection of songs. If you are looking for something new this season, this is the  one to get
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love her voice and the songs she chooses.  It also helps that she started out without any glory at all.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I enjoyed watching this series! It was very enjoyable and I looked forward to watching every week; hope the show will continue very soon! Awesome!!!
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|Big fan of live concerts on DVD. This is one of the best filmed concerts I've seen. Very good quality sound and great from start to finish. A must have for George Michael fans, you won't be disappointed.
B0055OG2BC|4.0|This doesn't come with the 50 year collection of James Bond blu-ray disks. So I'd recommend getting this to add to the collection.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked the book, good follow up to the Hunger Games. First book I bought for my kindle, I like the author.
B009CPGHDI|1.0|This was listed as a movie not a documentary.  We did not even watch it.  Would request  our money back.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I saw this app and decided to try it out and IT WAS SO UNEXPLAINIBLY AWESOME AND SAVED ME AT LEAST $20. THIS APP IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL MUSIC LOVERS (I like minecraft music :) ) SO PLEASE GET I PROMISE U WILL LLLOOVVEE IT I know I do :).
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box (A Harry Bosch Novel)<br />Michael Connelly<br /><br />great read as always expected from connelly.  read it in e-book format which i really like
B007XNAOS0|3.0|Sorry if this offends the dyed in the wool Baroness fans, but I think John Baizley shpuld stick to creating his artworks. Perhaps I shouldn't pass judgement on the basis of just one album but I have no desire to hear more after hearing this one. It is all very competent in a cliched, metal way without showing much in the way of originality (a common fault of most metal music these days). On the other hand the artwork for their albums is great - apparently John Baizley does all their album art. Maybe he should just concentrate on the art.
B004SVM7BW|2.0|I tried using this App to make some notations on a PDF document, but because i wasn't familiar with how to use the App, I made some mistakes.  Some plainly marked instructions would have been helpful, because if there are any, I haven't found them.  Having made mistakes with the use of the App, my PDF document is now marked badly, and I can't figure out how to undo what I've done.<br /><br />This App doesn't seem to be the best, for reasons described.  I can see, now, what's possible with it, but you'd need to know ahead of time how to use it, or you'll mess up your document and then be unable to fix it.<br /><br />Too bad.  If you know what you're doing, it might be a useful tool, but without instructions, eh.  Plus, not being able to fix mistakes or remove annotations you've made is a big draw back.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was not up to John Grisham's standards.  It just seemed to be lacking in his usual suspense and storyline.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Saw Joe on &#34;Live From Daryl's House&#34; and learned about this release so I went straight to Amazon and picked it up. Its classic Walsh. Interesting titling. I recommend.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game to fill time.  A lot of strategy is needed.  Have gone through three times so far and keeps getting more and more difficult.  Would recommend this game.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I'm not sold...I just don't think I've got time for this.  Facebook takes up enough of my time as it is.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|A great cd so far! Has my favorites as well as some I haven't heard before. Most of the tunes are very catchy and I find myself &#34;listening&#34; to them in my head while working! Lol!
B000FA5SMK|4.0|With a writing style suited best for readers with nimble minds and dry senses of humor, the book balances the mystery with personalities detailed with a discerning and insightful understanding of the world and all its goodness, together with the bad.  From wineries to swamps, from historic museums to old fashioned potty chairs, from sitting back and relaxing on the front porch to murder next door, the book offers contrasts and famliarity.<br /><br />The writing style is the element that will capture the readers interest, or that same style will push the reader away.  The story is good, the characters well developed, and the mystery decent, but the style is what will capture the reader's attention.  The book is highly recommended for the reader seeking humor and mystery, with just a touch of romance that doesn't overwhelm and define the genre.  It is a great book for those wanting to read a story that entertains in the short term and holds your interest for the long term.
B00961ZESW|4.0|As with most cd's, there are some tracks that I like and some that I don't. This is the same way. But don't let that discourage you from buying this. Overall, it is a great cd to listen to.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|So much good information in here. Taubes is able to convey a lot of scientific information without it felling like a lecture. I wish I could get the rest of my family to read it. They still think my low carb diet is dangerous even though I am a Type 2 diabetic and it actually is very necessary.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Another great cd from Pink! I find myself &#34;listening&#34; to some of these tracks in my head while at work. When I notice myself doing that, I sort of tell myself that I might be listening to the cd too much! Lol!
B005KXV8XK|4.0|This is a nice collection of Deep Purple's time on the BBC! Too bad some of the sessions were lost,but its always great to hear different renditions of their songs. The only reason for the 4-star rating is that some of the songs sound quality is'nt the greatest,but its still worth every cent of the asking price! If your a fan of Deep Purple,I would definitely recommend this set!
B00A993UWM|4.0|I enjoyed listening to Kesha's first cd and when I saw this one, I wanted to see what it was like. Still listening to it to form an opinion.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|Worth the price alone for the bonus DVD with the full dress rehearsal performance! Jason Bonham,in my opinion,was a great choice to take the drum stool for this,and wish they would have decided to tour,but at least they filmed this,and released it for the fans,which was cool. Great performance and captured nicely on this set. Hopefully,we will continue to get more releases of Zeppelin live material,and this is a nice addition to anyone's collection!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is entertaining and challenging enough to keep you interested for more then 5 minutes.  I am not real crazy about the frequency of the ads but it is understandable for a freeware product.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|If your a fan of Soundgarden,or just Chris Cornell,this CD is for you! Sounds like 1996 all over again! Great to hear these guys together again,and hope they are for a VERY long time! Now they just need to come here on tour,so I can see them live! Long Live Soundgarden!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The film is very good, however the music is a little lackluster. Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman, however, are amazing and steal the show.
B0091Q82L8|4.0|Great show after the famous Leeds show! The bands perfomance is once again top notch,and are playing at their highest level. So why only a 4 star rating then? 1st,You can tell the banter in between songs was cut out,and to me that takes away some of the enjoyment of having a live show.Also,the borrowing of Entwistle's basslines for the first few songs from Leeds,since the ones from this show were missing,but other than that,I would definitely Recommend this show to any fan of the Who from this period! Long Live The Who!!!
B0092QITO2|5.0|I really liked the earlier Total Recall movie and I've seen it at least a hundred times.  This new, updated and improved Total Recall is much better than the first.  It's more \\"high-tech\\" i.e. flying cars, holographic devices and mobile phone technology implanted in the palms of people's hands. Nice!  More guns and action from beginning to end.  As another reviewer said, the plot is different enough from the first to make the movie really interesting.  The casting is good with Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale as leads.
B00297FEUS|4.0|If your a fan of this cd,I think its a must-have,simply for the remaster,plus the 2nd disc filled with unreleased gems.I really enjoyed the first 2 songs on disc 2,and though Im not a huge fan of Twisted sister,Im glad I bought it. This really brought back some memories of my younger years,and it was cool to hear these songs again!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy does it again with Threat Vector,always gives us a long book,page wise,but suspenseful reading.It is difficult to put the book down,wanting to stay in the moment.I have enjoyed every Clancy novel I have read,and already I eagerly await the next one.
B00000IMTE|4.0|If your a fan of Ritchie Blackmore,or Ronnie James Dio,this is a great CD to add to the collection! Essentially,this is Elf feat. Ritchie,but is a great cd nonetheless. Being a HUGE fan of Ritchie myself this was a must-have purely on already having it on cassette,and needing to upgrade,but what a great collection of songs! Man on the silver mountain,16th century greensleeves,and Temple of the king,just to name a few. You can tell by listening,that Ritchie was out to prove that he could standout on his own,and he definitely proves it here. Great CD at a Great price! Long Live Ritchie Blackmore!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is not a screwball comedy or a romantic comedy.  This is a simple story of people trying to find their place in the world.  Do you need to travel halfway around the world to still feel vital?  Can you make your dreams a reality if you dream hard enough?  It isn't a laugh-a-minute film.  It is, however, very honest with its characters and the laughs are definitely there.
030758836X|5.0|I am an avid reader and I must say this book goes on my top ten list, maybe even top five.  Gillian Flynn kept me guessing all the way to the end.  Guessing wrong if course.  I have never read a book with so many twists and turns.  Love if!
B005LAIHYU|3.0|This film was more about action than about making the unique aspects of Lincoln's life seem like a cover for his exploits as a vampire hunter.  The action is very good.  Benjamin Walker is no Daniel Day Lewis but he is likable enough as Honest Abe.  One cannot help but wonder what a film with this premise and the cast of the Spielberg film would look like.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Saw Ted in theaters and hadn't laughed that hard since Anchorman. However, unlike the Channel 4 News Team, Ted didn't have the same appeal the second time.  Still funny, but it doesn't have the one liners that make me WANT to watch it again. Wahlberg does comedy with the best of them, so seeing him is always a treat. Absolutely worth seeing at least once.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Kenneth Branaugh did not seem like the obvious choice to direct this, but it works well.  There is some debate is the Asgard material or the scenes on Earth are better.  The concept of a person trapped on an alien world is not a new one.  They play it fairly well here.
B009K45Y62|5.0|This was the end of an Epic trilogy, I also got the limited edition that will go in my display case! I love the story line, and Bane was terrifying. But, as far as villains, It has to go The Joker Heath Ledger, He was brilliant
B005LAII0I|4.0|This was one way to do it.  One obviously compares this with the Kristin Stewart film.  This is much lighter.  The costumes and sets are lavish.  The cast seems to be having fun.  There are actual little people playing the dwarves.  You're never clutching your heart in fear watching this, but more often than not you are smiling.  I saw it in the theater with my daughter and we still love the song Snow sings at the end.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Not Oscar material but an awesome holiday movie! Many laugh out loud moments. I let my 9.5 year old watch and while he didn't completely understand the humor it was good clean stuff. There was one part with some drinking but as far as I can remember that would be the harshest thing an older elementary school kid would see. As for adults....very funny!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This could have been better, yes, but it also could have been so much worse.  What works in the film works well.  What doesn't work isn't so big that it ruins the movie for you.  Yes, it has flaws.  It also had a very big package to deliver and it certainly did.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn paints a scary look at modern-day ralationships and makes desparate housewives look like a fairy tale.  The interaction between husband and wife is anything but normal and yet her descriptions seem to fit their personalities to a remarkable degree.  I was blown away by the ending and, quite frankly, did not see this one coming.  Definitely can recommend this one.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|This is not a history lesson.  This is entertainment.  Did Sean Parker do and say all those things?  Is this exactly how things went down?  If that's what you want to know, this is not the film for you.  This is a play and should be engaged as such.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an excellent book and one that I feel relays factual information relative to killing bin Laden.  I definitely enjoyed reading about the preperation prior to the raid itself.  The events and errors occuring during this raid, reveal how resourceful Seal Teams are when confronting real-time issues and situations.  It is an excellent look into our special forces and how they operate.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I liked the plot the action etc... I would much prefer to see Matt Damon as the main actor. It was good overall.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Entirely fiction but a great read nevertheless.  Albom does a marvelous job in defining how &#34;modern-day&#34; man views time and the uses of time.  I can certainly recommend this book to you.
0525953728|2.0|This book is written at a 3rd grade level. Verbally developed visuals are poor. Dialog is very limited and generally consists of one liners. I was hard-pressed to find information I hadn't already read about on the UBL raid, SEAL equipment or tactics. For all the hype and as the author states, there is nothing classified about this book.<br /><br />Not to take away from the hard-ships born and professional accumen of Navy SEALs, but these stories aren't well told. The writing doesn't come close to painting the picture of what these folks endure in serving their country.<br /><br />If you're going to read it, borrow it...
B0000793ZA|4.0|Spatkle In The Rain is one of the best albums by Simple Minds.  It does remind you of U2 to a certain degree with the production, but the songs are excellent or even great.  Others have commented that this album starts their decline as a band but I disagree.  This album and New Gold Dream is what I would suggest for the uninitiated
B0086213XW|5.0|Love Sarah Polley and Michelle Williams.  Thought it was very poetic, touching and real in a way that most movies can only hope to achieve.  While the story itself was interesting and really explored the nature of desire and the deliciousness of it all, it ultimately ended in a very thorough and true exploration of human nature and learning to deal with ourselves.  Best movie I have seen in a long time!  Highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book once again. Only a few slow spots compared to none in the first. I am looking forward to book three .
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I first read this to my daughter when she was 6 years old. It was her favorite story and we even bought a copy for her school's library!! When I saw it available on Kindle a few weeks ago I bought it for her....she is 22 years old now and loves it just as much now as she did then. Maybe more.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This is a must have product for Hero3 camera<br />Great that all the covers are included in the package<br />GoPro has great technology for such compact camera<br />Will recommend and love it.....<br />Seller is also great, quick shipping.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|We HAVE to watch this movie every year during the holiday season at least once. I actually had to buy a new copy of if this year because we wore out the previous one!! By the end of the movie my husband and I are both sobbing our hearts out just like we did the very first time we watched it. Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy,.....every performance in this movie is awesome...Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman...I was planning on giving this new Blu-ray version to my husband on Christmas Eve but I think I'm going to have watch it right now....and the soundtrack is great too!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great game fun and challenging. happy I bought the full version also!!!<br />definitely recommended to anyone who likes mystery games
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is by far the best show on television!  If you are not watching this, you are missing out!
B0085YNML2|3.0|This game is kind of slow & needs instructions. It is kind of cute & addictive though. Would be better for kids.
B005IQZB14|5.0|It was inspiring and interesting to read. Well written and overall a good, entertaining book, I would highly reccomend. The author was relatable and her story was honest.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This soundtrack, if possible is even BETTER than the soundtracks to the movies in the LOTR trilogy it is epic and sweeping but also has some silliness like the song sung by the Dwarves 'blunt the knives'... A+++ all around great soundtrack and great music, the Song of the Lonely Mountain is beautiful in how it has a definitively dwarvishness to the music
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Awesome concert dvd!! the definitive record of Led Zeppelin in concert, much better than the live aid recording! Crystal clear sound and video!
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I have to say of all Owl City's albums this one is probably the best there is only one song on it that I don't absolutely LOVE and even it isnt half bad... so to anyone who likes Owl City or just likes good Pop music or music with fun upbeat lyrics I'd recommend this album, and the song Galaxies while straying from the typical themes of Owl City songs is still an amazing song it's had me to the point of tears once or twice
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This is Clint Eastwood in another great movie representing an average individual. Not inspector Callahan but an everyday Joe with his problems and qualities.<br /><br />Clint plays the role of an aging baseball scout (Gus Lobel) who works for the Atlant Braves, and who is slowly losing his sight and the respect of the people around him. His daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) who is auditioning to became partner with a macho law firm (aren't all like this?...patronizing) must take time off and help him in his last assignment. At this point everybody knows what will happen to her partnership in the firm... but apparently she is resolved this time to help her father. During the trip many old family stories come out, including the fact that he had to practically abandon her when she was little after her mom died. They also meet another scout (Justin Timberlake) who is really more interested in ...Mickey than in baseball.<br /><br />As always, Clint Eastwood performance is outstanding. Reminded me of \\"Bloodwoork\\" where again he is weak and dependable. He also reminded me of \\"Bloodwork\\" because he is always fighting an arrogant young idiot who thinks he knows everything after few months on the job. Of course the plot in this movie is totally different from the one in \\"Bloodwork\\".<br /><br />This movie represents very accurately our society and what is happening these days. On one hand we have an old experienced guy who lives in a modest house with minimum furniture, who travels alot, and who is used to seat in the stands for years and years watching AAA and high school games all over the country and uses his on-the-field experience and instinct to select real baseball talent, not really caring for the payback. On the other side we have an arrogant idiot with an iPod and an iPhone with minimum education and a computer, who thinks that he knows everything because he can Google the player's name and check his statistics. Never saw him play but he is looking at the stats and therefore if he looks great on paper he must be a great player. In addition, anticipating that he will be in this job forever because he is so good (...because he has a computer), he is living the great life on a credit card (...but I just bought a boat and I have mortgage payments). Typical metrosexual that we usually expect to find in New York city, but he is in Atlanta and works for the Braves.<br /><br />This kind of attitude has real consequences in life. Just two examples. Look at the mess with the BCS. Every year it is a blow out because it is not the people on the side lines who decide which is the best team and which teams are going to play in the championship game. The computers decide (strength of schedule, stats etc). Look what happened to Tim Tebow. A decent human being with huge potential to become a great QB, coming out of a great school. The sportscasters ridiculed him because he is a Christian, putting up his bad stats all the time, to a point that now it will be difficult for him to come back. Only because the teams are affraid to offer him a contract because of what the sportscasters will say. If it weren't for the idiots sportscasters (who know everything because they have a computer in front of them and can draw footbal plays) he could have the starting QB position in a good team and with a decent QB coach he could have done well in the NFL.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is not surprising but is not predictable either. Really enjoyed the scene towards the end when Mickey disposes of her cell phone. There is so much patience to have with some people!<br /><br />This is a great solid family movie with great acting, a solid story, and great direction. Five stars all around. Thank you Mr. Eastwood for another great movie to put next to Bloodwork, Million dollar Baby, and Gran Torino.re if he looks great on paper he must be a great player.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett at his best.<br />Growing up as a kid during WWII it was interesting to follow families living in the heart of the conflict.
B00004TS0E|1.0|Original was excellent so I doubted I would like this remake very much.  I was pleasantly surprised tho and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a easy to watch movie with good actors and it kept me engaged.  Lacks some of the charm of the original but I guess that makes it more palatable to viewers who aren't avid classic movie watchers like me.  Would recommend.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Although very similar to Where's My Water, there are enough differences in gameplay to make this game feel fresh. I love it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey! The characters, drama, costumes, beautiful settings are all spectacular. I wish season 3 was already out.
B009H442DG|5.0|I have been a fan of Olivia Newton-John & John Travolta since the movie Grease.  I had the wonderful pleasure of seeing Olivia in concert Dec 8th in Pittsburgh & she was amazing and so beautiful!  I couldn't wait to get this CD, because after all these years they're still 'THE ONE THAT I WANT'!  So 'HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS', and get this CD for yourself or someone you love, because 'I THINK YOU MIGHT LIKE IT'!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|From the second I turned it on to the second it was over it had my full attention! A definite must see!
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It's like a really funny Family Guy episode.  Was worth getting it in HD, cheaper than anywhere else too.
0316226424|4.0|A good book, but I wanted a big juicy ending. It made me want more. Love the posters inside, though
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was awesome, great action.  They also keep the humor up through the whole movie.  One of the best Super hero movies ever.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are very good. I recommend them to people who like adventure and cliff hanger endings. You never know what is going to happen next!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good story-lots of visual explanation (maybe a little too much). Loved the twists and turns. Needed a map to identify the areas.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|I spent only $6.00 to see this turkey, and it was $6.00 too much as well as a large waste of time.<br />  The trailers present the film as an action/adventure film about a quick-thinking pilot who's efforts saved the lives of hundreds on the plane.  There was about 15 minutes in the film about this.  The remaining more than two hours glorify gratuitous sex and nudity, how alcoholics can fake sobriety by abusing cocaine, and how a drug pusher can save the day though the \\"proper\\" use of his wares.<br />  If you are looking for an action adventure film, you can certainly pass this one by.  It's a very different animal.  But if you're looking for a film that presents the morally nihilistic views Hollywood seems so intent in presenting as the norm, and you want to bring that sort of worldview into your home, this is the film for you.

B006RXPUR2|5.0|Ben Affleck had done a masterful job in bringing this story to life. His characters are fully fleshed out, and very interesting. And the moral dilemma he presents will have you deep in thought.

B00AMBH70S|4.0|This movie is worth seeing, but lacks a good story line. The action is fun to watch. I would say it is much like a roller coaster ride: fun while you ride, but it does not really grab your mind after the fact.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book on my Kindle based on the great reviews on my Goodreads application.  The reviews were right.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is written in a very different style than most murder mysteries and the author does a nice job developing his characters.
0385342039|4.0|this is not quite as good as her other novels in the chick lit genre but the ghost aspect is grand. This is, very good but not outstanding. the strongest part of the book is the lead, lara's, relationship with the ghost of her great aunt sadie. the weaker parts are with the men, her former boyfriend, josh, and her future boyfriend, ed. sadie is an absolute hoot.  she is a twenties flapper girl who had a romance with a now famous albeit dead artist. lara's uncle is also very interesting. he is a supposed business tycoon who supposedly pulled himself up from his own bootstraps but sadie starts uncovering his wrongdoings with lara's help. even the romance parts are very good when sadie is along with lara. it is when lara is without sadie that the book loses its zip. fortunately, sadie is in most of the book and that makes it well worth reading.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0593059824|5.0|unfortunately, nora ephron died or this would have been the perfect film for her to direct. i lead with this because i think this would make a terrific movie,  there is the problem of showing text messaging in a non boring way but i am sure it can be done.  it sure ws done well on the page here for that is how these two meet. poppy loses both her engagement ring and her phone on the night of her hen party.  she finds a mobile phone in a trash can and it belongs to sam, a business exec whose PA just quit by throwing the phone there, with that we are offmand running, the fiancee and his family are also great pleasures in this book as they are intellectual snobs.  there is a scrabble game with the in-laws which shoukd become scrabble lore with those of us who play it a lot.<br /><br />the great thing about this author is this is her chick lit pseudonym.  if you tire of her chick lit and want her more serious work, it is published under her real name, madeline wickham,  she truly offers something for all women readers.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has some particularly special books and to me this is one of them.  The strengths of the characters and the terrible weaknesses of others.  Even though I had a pretty good feeling of the ultimate outcome of the story, I couldn't put it down and loved every page!  To me it tells a very important story about love in many important ways and definitely not just a sappy love story.  Put it up there with The Notebook and Message In a Bottle.  Read it!!
0061765236|5.0|\\"The Pact\\" is a dramatic story written by author Jodi Picoult that touches on the very sensitive subject of teen suicide. It is a fictional book with a real life; it could happen to your family edge. This is a love story that went wrong, exploring all the emotions surrounding obsession, loss, blame and all the guilt in between. It is an eye opening, suspenseful tale that brings to reality the most feared question: Do we know our children or what they may be capable of? This is Picoult's fifth novel in her package of physiological dramas that hit where everyone most fears; home. Her novels dare to breach the everyday tragedies of our youth, leaving you with the most unforgettable experience of a wakeup call.<br />For eighteen years the Harte's and Gold's have shared everything in their lives from birthdays, vacations to childhood illnesses. When the families' two teenagers Chris and Emily became involved the families were thrilled to now share their families as well. No one would have ever expected they would have to share a devastating tragedy that would tear their families apart. The life shattering call came at three a.m., Emily was dead and Chris could not remember what had happened. As both families are desperate for answers, the story unfolds to the parent's realization their children had entered into a suicide pact.<br />Both sets of parents arrived at the hospital after that dreadful early morning call. Emily has been shot and Chris cannot tell them the events that occurred. Lead Detective Marrone with the local police is investigating the tragedy and is convinced this was murder. Awaiting a statement from Chris the detective drops a tragic blow that neither family was ready for. As Chris' father explains why the detective cannot talk to his son.... \\"We couldn't tell him, not like this. He loved her.\\" Detective Marrone stared at him. \\"Maybe,\\" she said. \\"But he also may have shot her' (Picoult, 1998). In the next painful hours, tragic details about the truth will emerge.<br /> The gun that killed Emily belonged to Dr. Harte, Chris' father. There was one bullet left in the gun, the bullet that was meant for Chris himself, the first was used to kill Emily. It becomes inevitable this was a suicide pact that was unfinished. Chris is charged with Emily's murder making a tragic event catastrophic. Picoult displays a good understanding of the agony from all parties involved. From how life as Chris knew it is over, to the blame of the event driving a wedge between the two couples and destroying their friendships. Even the feeling of being forgotten Chris' little sister feels is displayed in a heart wrenching Christmas morning scene.<br />In the midst of all their pain Chris' life is on the line as he faces a murder trial, for killing the only girl he ever loved. Chris goes through deep emotions as the trial proceeds, some realizations too hard to bear. He has to finally face the truth of his relationship with Emily, did she really love him and in what nature. Picoult brushes on the subject of teen emotional stability and what reasons could a beautiful, young girl have to want to take her own life. As you revisit the past and what leads up to the horrific events the pieces start to fall into place just as captivating as the shocking beginning of the story. Your taken through details of this couples childhoods and the secrets that are hidden deep in Emily's closet. The events of that dreadful night finally come together in a moving testimony when Chris takes the stand in his own defense. The suspenseful trial is at a close and the outcome is shocking to say the least. This is not a story that ends with a happy ending, but how could it be with a young girl dead and a left a broken young man.<br />This is an emotional novel but a very good one to keep you turning the pages. There is a saddening reality to the novel of what your children could be facing daily. Hopefully there will be some lessons learned from the audience after engaging in the depth of this novel. I know I will never look at teen suicide the same or doubt its severity again. This is a highly recommended piece of literature, as always Picoult has touched my soul (Aliventi, 2010).
1781161313|1.0|i pre ordered the colonial space marines game coming out in feb 2013 - so when i came upon this product by accident i was so excited. i knew the book was older but i thought it would be a fun thing -and maybe on a longshot useful- to have alongside the game. i was really looking forward to iilustrations of the weaponry and their uses in the films.<br /><br />i recieved this book in super quick time. i opened it up and was just, almost shocked, but how awful the drawings were (drawings not illustrations). it looked as if someone typed some mass blocks of random whatnot and asked a 6 year old to draw some rifles that they stuck in randomly. it was just terrible terrible terrible. they had alot of nerve to publish that junk with an Aliens title.<br /><br /> i might not have felt so duped if they had photos (preferably of the weapons- since this is a weapon manual!)  form the film in here. they had 2 photos- of aliens.<br /><br />im a die hard aliens fan and i woulda kept this for just about any reason just becasue it was aliens, it was colonial marines no less. but this was embarrassing to have, i sent it right back- the good people at amazon helped me with a fast refund.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I got this as a free app of the day and I really enjoy it.  It isn't super challenging, but it's still worth it
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this app daily.  I set the timer on it and fall asleep with it every night. I use the alarm o wake me up with the fade in feature.  It is a lot better waking p o this than music or a blaring alarm.  Wakes you p gradually instead of being jolted awake.
0756666937|5.0|Very impressed by the condition of the book and contents is well worth the cost.  History of Lego's made fun.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|First, let me say, I am a huge fan of the Bourne franchise and own all three of the preceding movies. That said, this movie was, overall, a real disappointment.<br /><br />Others have explained the plot, and the way they have tied it to the previous movies, but that seems to be all this movie aspires to do. It's like the movie studio sat around and said, \\"Okay, how can we make some more money off the `Bourne` thing?\\" By the end of the movie, I could only feel a bit cheated, as if the executives grabbed the first half of one of Robert Ludlum's books and made a movie from it -- giving us plenty of character development and backstory with absolutely no conclusion.<br /><br />I can only conclude that this entire movie was simply dedicated to introducing Cross as the new main character for future movies. Unfortunately, I don't share the leading lady's final sentiment of hoping they were lost, but hoped the producers would have found a way to make this movie go somewhere.<br /><br />This movie, overall, had fantastic action as always, and an underwhelming story.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I love the movie. It hurts to laugh all the way. The only disappointment is the unrated version u need  computer connection to tv. If u have it. It is the next best thing. Enjoy the movie. I love bears and still do.

B00AHXDECG|5.0|I have to listen to every song on repeat. I am addicted to Bruno Mars and this cd. It's one of my new faves.
B0072OFM28|4.0|(I mention something that would be a spoiler if you've not seen this show already)  I liked this season.  It made me very interested in what the next season will hold.  It took a while to get used to the actor changes.  Some good bittersweet moments.  Lucy Lawless was great.  She continued her great scheming ways.  The intensity isn't the same as the first season.  With some of the actor changes, including Spartacus due to Andy's early passing, it seems like a different show or perhaps better to think of it as a sequel.  Keeping with season 1, most of the people are well sculpted.  It also keeps with plenty of blood and gore for those who enjoy that aspect of the show.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept me guessing pretty much throughout.  Characters were interesting.  One of those books I kept wanting to come back to.
B0018RFLN0|5.0|Great movie to add to the DVD collection and Tom Cruise is such a good actor which shows in the majority of his movies.

B006MW3V6U|3.0|Have loved watching Season 1&2 of Downton Abbey using Amazon Prime, but once it hit the last episode of Season 2, #9..it won't load. For three days days &#34;Network Down&#34;. Everything else is working, so why isn't this!?!?!<br />Might not be worth paying for, especially since item I ordered for Christmas wasn't eligible for the Prime shipping which was touted as part of the package. :(
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Even with it being slightly unbelievable...it was a cute story making you wish that it could happen to you. I really liked it!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books, and this one is every bit as good. In fact, several surprises that I never saw coming.  It is a quick read--I read it start to finish in 1 day--could not put it down.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I deleted this game. No more FREE games that required purchased with &#34;real money&#34; to play! Frustrating and disappointing for the kids unless parents fork over more and more cash. Much better to buy a game than fall for one of these marketing tricks.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Another fun tale.  Makes you sorry the story is coming to an end and there are no more chapters.  It will be fun to see how this transfers to the big screen.
B001NCL382|5.0|If you want a nice one disc Best of Cream there are several choices but this one works out just fine. The big hits are here and the MP3 sound seems good to me. I had forgotten how great Jack Bruce sang and his bass playing is individual and melodic. The counter melodies Bruce plays against Clapton's guitar resemble, to me at least, the 17th 18th century technique of fugue. Baker's drumming was always unique and the way they manage to blend it all together makes clear these guys were the cream of the crop at that time. To be fair, there are some weak cuts, the banal 'Anyone for Tennis' comes to mind but still this is a good deal. I'm glad I bought this.
B001DUGOWY|2.0|I read this book since it had been selected by my book club.  It sounded interesting: the story of a man whose family background tells him he could have, should have been more than a grocery clerk and how a moral man reacts when presented with not-so-moral opportunity in a seemingly corrupt world.<br /><br />I was expecting a story that would grab and hold my attention.  While the central conflict was eventually revealed, the various tangents the narration wandered off on became too distracting to really enjoy the central core of the story.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the ending.  I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say that when I reached the last page on my Kindle I had to go back and see if I'd missed something.  It was not only abrupt but Ethan's actions seemed out of character.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This was a very well written book about Dominique's life not only in gymnastics but also with her family and coaches.  I suggest anyone who likes watching the Women's Gymnastics or the Olympics in general read this!  It is very eye opening to those of us outside of the sport.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I like. this game. My kids and I both enjoyed this game together. We played the game for two days. I would. recommend. it to anyone who likes mystery games.
B003IGMJ48|5.0|I consider this to be one of my top 10 albums of all time.  This is where Scorpions begin to define their sound as they take quite a different approach than they did with their first album \\"Lonesome Crow.\\"  When I first saw this album was done in 1974 I was not expecting to be hit with the hard driving \\"Speedy's Coming\\" which starts this album off.  Roth's lead guitar is wild and ahead of its time.  There wasn't much metal on the scene at this time, Judas Priest had released their first album the same year then there were a few other bands like Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Deep Purple, and UFO.  I would consider this to be one of the hardest hitting albums of it's time, especially with the first 3 songs.  Another notable aspect of this album is the fast fingerstyle picking that is used during the intros of \\"They Need A Million\\" and \\"Fly to the Rainbow.\\"  Scorpions only seemed to have used this classical style of picking in this album which only adds to the variety.  Speaking of variety, there is a lot of it in this album.  Each song is different from the other and yet every song is enjoyable.  Duel and sometimes triple guitars are used in songs like \\"They need A Million\\" and \\"Fly to the Rainbow\\" almost in the style later used by Iron Maiden.    I consider the Title Track to be the bands masterpiece as it starts out with fast finger style guitar with Klaus singing, then it kicks into the duel upbeat guitars with a verse that repeats 3 times.  Then it goes into wild whammy style guitar that slows down with Roth doing the somewhat talking vocals and ends with a slow heavy riff that fades away.  It's too bad that Scorpions didn't write any epics like this after this album, the closest being songs like \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\" and \\"Born to Touch Your Feelings.\\"    If you like the Scorpions when they were in their prime, you may like this album.  I think it was just as hard driving as albums like \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Love at First Sting\\" with a little more variety.  It does have some psychodelic overtones but it fits well with this album.    [...]

B005LAIHY0|1.0|The only thing that would have made this a decent movie is if the girl had died on the planet and the engineer had gone to earth and targeted everyone associated with this movie.  Pull out the original Alien and watch it instead of this and you will be much happier. Never liked any of the characters.  The \\"scientists\\" make the worst decisions. They have recordings of the holograms from the planet but don't seem to have audio of the crew getting attacked?  Really?  The can tell exactly where their flying probes are at but not the crew?  Really? Save youself time and money, find another movie.

B009JBWOU0|4.0|As far back as I can recall being a fan of anything related to comic books, the comic book film was a genre that was always wrapped in imperfection. While there were those who gave it praise there were those that felt it was a butchery of all that was pure in their world. I would have to say that excluding a very select few, I was never satisfied when it came to films adapted by comic books.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, a director whom I had known about, but never truly new back in 2005 finally said it is time for the world of comic books to be take seriously. While X-MEN & Spider-Man had already began going down that path 'Batman Beings' not only perfected the evolution, but it also finally gave us a fantastic scripted, cast & homage to Bob Kanes' icon. Fast forward to 2012 and you have one of the most beautiful comic book franchises in history...yet at a price none the less.<br /><br />Everything about these three films is wonderful, but once again as someone who adores the new Marvel film universe, it is going to be very hard to bring the world of DC comics to the big screen. Superman and Batman seem to be the only ones that any director or writer wants to tackle and now with how real and dark that Nolans 'trilogy is it is going to be even harder to bring heroes like Wonder Woman, The Flash and yes even a good Green Lantern sequel to the big screen. Still, with Zack Snyder tackling the Superman franchise and a Justice League film on the horizon in 2015 I have a feeling that it can be done. The three Dark Knight films of course are wonderful the massive cast that was gathered for these films are perfect, Christian Bale was the perfect Bruce Wayne and it is about time that was done correctly. Heath Ledger (RIP) wowed me as the Joker and as a fan of Anne Hathaway, I adored her as Catwoman. This is a film experience unlike any other and they will be treasured for years to come. I am just so happy that when I have kids of my own and they are old enough to learn about Batman, along side the Animated Series and the Adam West film these will be films I will be excited and proud to share with them.Batman, along side the Animated Series and the Adam West film these will be films I will be excited and proud to share with them.

It has plenty of room for all my supplies, extra pockets for my wallet, cell phone and medication. I now have no need to carry a camera bag and a purse. It seems to be very well made as well. Two Thumbs Up!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I have been a Tim Burton fan since I first saw 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'and while I may not enjoy all of his work it is so hard for him to make a film that I will dislike. Sweeney Todd based on the famous musical, of course is one of the few in his collection I never got around to seeing. Well, the holiday season finally gave me this film and I loved it!<br /><br />If not for 'Edward Scissorhands', Sweeney Todd would probably be my favorite film of Burton. Johnny Depp is amazing as always and yes he sings! The rest of the cast including Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and yes even Sacha Baron-Cohen are all wonderful. Even if you have never seen this play you're gonna love it as it is Tim Burton doing what he does best.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Keeps your interest, enjoyable, somewhat relaxing to play. Various combinations of move changers promotes challenge. The music is unintrusive maybe even enhancing to gameply.
B008G59IBI|5.0|With the final installment of the 2012 Green Day trilogy, I never would have expected what 'Tre' gave me. This is not the old school Green Day sound, nor is this them trying to be. 'Tre' offers something I never would have expected from Green Day and mellow and meaningful album about embracing youth and preparing for what the world is going to throw at you. Of course Green Day does get loud in a few songs, but every single song on this album is unique and stands out each and every time on its own.<br /><br />I don't know what this album means or what this Green Day will become in the future, but now that the trilogy is complete I am happy with what I got. I feel that there is so much more that Green Day has to offer and from a band that many felt would never amount to anything, almost 25 years strong I am excited for their next record.

B0076DEJMO|4.0|I have read all of Joe Abercrombie's books. Heroes is my favorite. Followed by the trilogy. Then red country. I absolutely did not like Best Served Cold.<br /><br />After the characters from Heroes, I was a bit let down by the lack of depth, definition, and uniqueness. Temple was the  most interesting but can't say that I will miss him. It was nice to see Lamb again. Didn't love his rushed exit at the end opening him up for future cameos. No one else really stood out to me. I wish he took some more time with the characters and kept the world a little smaller.<br /><br />Overall a fun read. I admit to skimming a little. But Joe Abercrombie is still a must read in my book.<br /><br />Next please.

Sorry, but this Storm Corrosion just isn't doing it for me. Reminds me too much of Porcupine Tree's Voyage 34, which was another of Wilson's artsy, mood music excursions. Can't go higher than 2 stars here, which kills me because I adore these two artists.
B00000F214|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was in College and it is the best movie. Another Man movie. As Marvin Gay said, you can belive only half of what you see and none of what you hear and this movie illustrates that perfectly. Must have.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is an entertining, relatively mindless game to help pass time. My children (7,6,4) also enjoy playing it. Easy to use and levels to increase in difficulty as you progress through. I like it better than the regular Angry Bird games.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|The whole CD is great and I'm a pretty picky listener. I play this album non-stop on my mp3 player at the gym - I can't stop listening to it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|El James is a really fine writer and since her first book sold 50 million copies in the first week it came out I am not alone saying that.
B00A8Z6KN8|3.0|The movie had great, incredible, wonderful music.  I decided to buy the soundtrack and get that incredible music.  And I got it, in a sense.<br /><br />I got exactly what was shown in theaters.  Unfortunately, that's not a glowing recommendation item.  Some items, like 'Misty Mountains' were cut short for the movie -- I expected the full length song in the soundtrack.  Other songs make a great backdrop to dialogue, but are MUCH less interesting to listen to in and of themselves.  The great, stirring leitmotifs are buried here and there among the long song tracks that are included.<br /><br />It was my mistake of course; I was expecting something that had been remastered and rearranged for listening in it's own right; what I got was EXACTLY what it was labeled as.  Not 'the music of' the Hobbit, but the soundtrack of it.
B005LAIISU|5.0|I am an Ice Age Fan.  I bought this one to add to my collection of Ice Age movies.  All of the characters are great but I love that squirrel that has a hard time collecting an acorn.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|El James is one fine writer.  With such high sales for her books I am not the only one that thinks that.  But the best part is EL James angers JK Rowlings.  Jk Rowlings is very upset because EL James is a better writer and has sold many more books than JK Rowlings did with her Harry Potter books.  Also, Rowlings' latest book, Casual Vacancy is a flop.  I was a serious Harry Potter fan until Rowlings killed main characters in her last two books and I felt really betrayed by her.  So when I found out how angry Rowlings was at EL James because of the greater sales of books, I bought all three books to further anger Rowlings.  Pay back is a b-itch.  I think the failure of Rowlings latest book is that many of the Harry Potter fans are angry at Rowlings.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Excellent!!!  Enough said!!!  Action, witty dialogue!!!  Great special effects.  Is there such a thing as a perfect movie?  I think this was it!!!
B008220CYM|5.0|I do not understand why everyone gives this movie a bad review without seeing it. Because it is a excellent movie. In fact one of the years best. Cruise and Duval are excellent in the roles and I look forward to the next one. Cruise is great as reacher as well as he is in the mission impossible films. If you don't like cruise don't see the film. But it would be a shame because you would be missing one hell of a action movie.
B007SSDBBM|4.0|Fresh popcorn, a glass of wine and Kate & Leopold was the perfect recipe for a great evening with my wife. Although it won't become a classic, the storyline was unique and entertaining and the acting was superb. I would recommend this to any couple or family looking for a movie for enjoyment - well worth the time spent.

B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is my first album purchased and I am proud to say that it is. I absolutely love the music that is in this album. The quality is superior and I would recommend it to anyone that is already an Indie rock fan or someone looking for meaning in their music. It may also be considered alternative rock be some. Looking forward to hearing it on the radio.

0316228532|5.0|OK Harry Potter.  There that's all you are going to hear about that in this review.<br />Jo has done it again. What an amazing book but I will warn, it's not for everybody.  If you have not lived in England or know British Humor then it may be a bit harsh.  Just like the TV show \\"The Office\\" it was changed a little before it came to the states.  This book has not been changed and it comes at you raw and hard in places.  I like the way Jo has captured the small village life in parts of England.  I grew up in a small town and could totally see the similarities.<br />The book has a great bunch of characters, all with their differences and quirks.  It is set in what sounds like beautiful picturesque town that has its faults and problems.  The subjects covered are everything from drugs to affairs and more.  The language is strong in parts and may shock but that's all part of the culture.<br />Jo you truly are an amazing writer that can capture people and take them on an emotional roller coaster..
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|Persuasion is not Jane Austen's best novel.  It could use more dialogue and less exposition.  Yet the reader has no difficulty connecting with Anne's anxieties and cheering for her romantic triumph.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|When I retire, which is soon, I want to find a purpose in life like some characters did in this great show.  I love how the characters were individuals with personal problems that were solved during the show.  Great movie for inspiration to finding the courage to do something for yourself and not just sit at home and vegetate.  Now, I don't say we should all pack up and head for India.  There are great places in this world to visit and stay a while. There should be places around the world that would house the older generation for a few months at a time reasonably.  Then we could move on to the next place for a few months.  I like the idea and would like to know if it already exists.  Sign me up!
B007XIC1GI|1.0|\\"from the pit of despair to the top of the charts, and recounts his metamorphosis from a frightened Christian schoolboy into the most feared and revered music superstar in the country.

Hardly the most revered rock star in the country. Hardly one of the world's most dangerous rock stars.  This self-adoring review is enough to keep me from spending any money on this.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|Carey Mulligan recently became one of my favorite actresses after I saw her in the transcendent \\"Never Let Me Go\\" (with an equally stunning Keira Knightley in that film). Here, in \\"An Education,\\" Carey Mulligan is marvelous, enchanting, glowing. The script is silly, vapid, predictable, unbelievable, and full of flaws well documented by other reviewers. The songs by Duffy (\\"Smoke Without Fire\\" over the closing credits) and Melody Gardot (\\"Your Heart is as Black as Night\\") and Juliette Greco (\\"Sur les Quais du Vieux Paris\\") are sublime.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest. It's amazing. The only complaint I have about this app on my Kindle Fire is that sometimes, it takes forever to load pins and pictures. Creating pins takes a while too. Otherwise, the app is great.
B0010HA68I|5.0|OP/TECH has a good system for carrying your camera by the strap lugs rather than by the tripod mount like other (more expensive) systems.  I think it is more likely that your expensive camera will come loose from the tripod mount and drop than from the strap lugs.  You can use your pack straps or buy an OP/TECH harness, or just a regular neck strap if you prefer, and then just have a set of connectors for each of your cameras allowing them to use all of the OP/TECH options.

B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Great game with no pointless searching for hidden objects.  Everything you search for actually gets used during the game, sometimes more than once.  Thought and logic get a good workout.<br />Tesla was a fascinating genius to whom we owe a lot.  Google or Wiki him for some interesting reading.  The idea of making him the subject of an electronic game is wonderfully appropriate.<br />I have only one minor complaint or suggestion for iCOOLgeeks.  There are a LOT of scenes and navigating from place to place sometimes gets old.  The game has a built in map which shows you all of the scenes you've already visited.  It would be terrific if you could just click on a scene on the map and go there instantly.  That's the only thing that kept me from giving Tesla a solid 5 stars.<br /><br /> him
B005S9EJ14|4.0|It seems almost geriatric but The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a quiet charmer, almost like vintage wine. It gets better as time goes. The cast is absolutely delightful and Judi Dench and Maggie Smith carry the movie expertly while Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Dav Patel and the supporting cast all chip in to make this sleeper hit something more than a few old folks looking for a place to retire. There's humour and more importantly, plenty of heart, that life takes on different turns, sometimes bad but mostly right.  \\"Everything will be all right in the end. And if it's not all right, it's not yet the end.\\"
B007MU85D0|5.0|There's just something simultaneously happy, creative, and still complex about this album. The songwriting is basic, yet interesting, but the arrangements add a great deal of complexity and layers to the sound. Repeat listens have revealed new details that I did not notice at first; this has a lot more life in it than typical pop. The use of multiple leads really adds value as well. Overall, I can't recommend this album enough.
B0099116AY|3.0|There's nothing greater than watching Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee jones in a movie. They really saved it from becoming a snoozefest. Streep as versatile as ever, shines with her very nuance and movement (she even plays with herself in a self-satisfying scene). Tommy Lee Jones, pensive and often a whiny andropausal man, creates believable tension between them, a couple married for 30-odd years but feeling loveless. Steve Carell is decent but can't shake off his comedic streak. At times, the movie touches a nerve or two and makes you feel, but other times, it was just long conversations and the focus is on the two great stars' acting.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie is a must see for all dog lovers.  The relationship between man and dog is so heart warming!
B0015DWLD0|5.0|It's pretty easy to see why this book and author have garnered so many accolades.  This was a joy to read and a book to highly recommend to others.

0374214913|5.0|The name is somewhat unprepossessing, but the story was a sheer delight to me. It was a little bit of medieval history and mystery mixed with modern day computer whiz-bang, characters that were a bit loopy as though they came out of a modern day Dickens and an ending that was somewhat unexpected for me, but still very satisfying. The writing has some wonderful nuggets of phrasing that made me chuckle, and on the whole was a fun ride I would recommend to anyone. I saw this on a suggestion page on Amazon one day when I was looking up another book. The other book got tossed to the side and this one ended up being one of my all time favorites of 2012. I'd recommend this to anyone.

B0050X1OQ6|4.0|I wonder how Kingston feels about all the reviews for this particular SODIMM being based, not upon the \\"laptop memory\\" role this is intended to fulfill, but rather the Synology NAS application so many of us seem to be using it for?<br /><br />I recently purchased and installed a Synology 1512+ NAS (\\"network attached storage\\") system.  This system comes with two RAM slots, the first (on the CPU side) already populated with a 1GB stick, but the other (on the opposite, and accessible, side) unpopulated.  The system is set up to permit as much as 3GB of memory, and as is typically the case, adding more is sufficient to confuse the system and cause you problems (and potentially even data loss?)<br /><br />Synology sells their own 2GB \\"add on stick\\" which I'm sure is ideally set up for this device, but which is inappropriately expensive based upon current RAM pricing, so I thought I'd look for alternatives.  And here on Amazon, I found a TON of references to this particular stick as being \\"just as good, and a lot cheaper\\" than the Synology-provided RAM stick.  So, I went ahead and picked it up.<br /><br />It does seem to be 100% compatible, as the various other reviews state.  I can't say for certain that it's better than any other 2GB stick with the same specification might be, but I can say that it's perfectly suited for this application and is a fraction of the Synology-provided part's price.<br /><br />I've seen no change in the \\"normal\\" performance of my NAS after adding this, but large file transfers (such as backing up larger directories - like my entire \\"downloaded software archive\\" - to an attached USB3.0 disk which I'll keep stored in a safe place for security purposes) have speeded up noticably, so it's proven to be a worthwhile addition to my NAS.<br /><br />And this is why I come to Amazon... the customer reviews (positive and negative, \\"real\\" or \\"fake\\" in some cases, all tell me SOMETHING about the product!).  I'd probably just have purchased the Synology stick, and paid sixty dollars or so more, if it weren't for the reviews posted here.  Thanks, guys!

B005544V6A|5.0|I was actually introduced to &#34;Suits&#34; well into season 2 by a co-worker (I work at a law firm . . . but not nearly as sexy as this) and, although the last thing I wanted was to get hooked on a show about lawyers . . . it happened (not just for Harvey Specter and Mike Ross).  Actually, the supporting characters (especially his amazing assistant, Donna) and the man I love to hate, Louis (who manages to evoke both dislike and sympathy in almost equal parts . . . not an easy task for an actor) make this ensemble cast and story lines the show that can't be missed.  I'm looking forward to Season 3 (which at least I'll get to watch for free instead of buying it on Amazon after the fact) to see how things play out this season.  Love this show!
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I'm not a huge pop fanatic, but Ellie Goulding's voice and compositions really hit the spot when I'm in the mood. Music is so personal I would just recommend you listen to the samples or, *gasp*, try a few titles on youtube before purchasing.<br /><br />This album is noticeably darker than her previous Lights album, which I loved as well. Her lyrics for a few songs on Halycon are truly painful, so depending on my own mood I can't listen to a couple tracks at times. That being said, the lyrics are either perfectly simple and vibrant, or dark and painful, and sung quite expressively. There's a wider variety of composition and instrumentation on this album than Lights, and if you like her voice I would recommend getting both. Overall they are different and worth having, they aren't just more of the same.<br /><br />Four stars instead of five only because I always skip a few songs. I'd be the super picky teacher who doesn't give an A+ unless everything is super perfect, so don't let the lack of 5 stars throw you off.
B0059XTU22|5.0|The Short: Wonderfully cast, incredibly shot, relentlessly adventurous, and an (almost) spot on adaptation of the beloved classic, the first chapter in this highly anticipated trilogy doesn't disappoint in the slightest.  While it does stumble slightly in the beginning, the experience as a whole is one of the most enjoyable films of the year.  And while it does take some getting used to, the 48 FPS presentation (in 3D IMAX) is absolutely the best format to experience this journey.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />It's been nearly a decade since we last entered Middle Earth as envisioned by Peter Jackson.  There's no denying that The Return of the King was going to be a hard act to follow.  So lets just get this straight right off the bat: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no where near the caliber of the final chapter we saw in 2003.  What The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turns out to be is an unexpected, but necessary and welcome, change to Peter Jackson's landscape of Middle Earth.<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey features a memorable cast, but the standout is no doubt Martin Freeman as Bilbo.  He completely nails Bilbo's character!  Armitage is also fantastic as Thorin, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf is back again and still great.  The rest of the supporting cast is good, but only a handful of the dwarves get significant screen time.<br /><br />The technical wizardry is also of note, no doubt.  It's not truly noticeable until the latter part of the movie, where the special effects are absolutely incredible.  The rest of the movie is absolutely stunning.  The battle of Erebor, the escape from the goblin stronghold, the fights with orcs; everything is incredibly animated and beautifully done.  In 48 FPS the action does take some getting used to (the higher frame rate removes the standard blur of special effects. In the higher frame rate one can see all the nuances of the special effects, making each animated character or item look ultra artificial or incredibly real), but a good 30-45 minutes into the movie and the presentation felt completely normal, and in fact made some of the later scenes look absolutely spectacular.  I can't stress enough that, once your senses have adapted, the 48 FPS visuals are unlike anything else.<br /><br />Howard Shore's original score is his bet yet for sure.  Every bit of his original music captures the sweeping scale of the adventure, but it's the new theme that is still playing through my head even now.  The first time you hear the haunting new theme it will stick to you, but by the time it is blasting over action scenes it will send chills down your spine.  Original themes from TLOTR trilogy make brief returns in just the right places as well.  Overall, It's Howard Shore's best work yet.<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is more of a change of scenery from the past trips to Middle Earth.  It's subject material is much lighter, the action is much more sparse, and the character building is considerably different.  And in terms of being faithful to the beloved classic, aside from the added Radagast sub-plot and the added \\"white orc\\" (which made more sense from a cinematic adaptation standpoint, and a change that I prefer), The Hobbit is pretty faithful to the original story.  I will admit that the beginning is sluggish and overall a little too drawn out, the Goblin King looks like he was stripped out of a video game, and there are some inconsistencies here and there. So when it comes down to it, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not perfect.  Far from it actually.  It won't win any awards.  It won't be favored among the critics.  There are some silly choices made, and it isn't the most tightly crafted piece of film.<br /><br />But I could care less.<br /><br />This movie is adventurous, exciting, funny, all while capturing the original essence and character of the classic novel.  The stunning special effects, great performances and incredible score make this a memorable return trip.  But what truly stands out is Peter Jackson's eye for adventure.  There just hasn't been a quality adventure movie in a long while.  The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the perfect antidote.  It's big, epic filmmaking with a purpose: to tell a story (albeit the long winded way) that's grand in scale rooted deep within its characters.  Make time to see this movie, and go into it with excitement, because The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great deal of fun and makes one thing inevitable above all else: the wait for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is going to be incredibly painful.<br /><br />4.5/5 - while flawed, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is tremendously entertaining.urn trip.

B0016JBCJW|4.0|Moonrise Kingdom is Wes Anderson's best to date. I like the cast in The Darjeeling Limited, though. Owen Wilson is very good. The dynamics between the brothers is interesting. The story line is not as strong as I thought it could be. I kept waiting for more development or some resolution or climax but it never arrives. I guess that's Anderson's point. It's intentional but it makes the film's tone seem very flat. I found myself examining scenes as a director would, dissecting the film instead of experiencing it.  The cinematography is great and the comedy is unique and subtle. It's worth watching.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I always stay so captured in her books! Awesome writing!! Couldn't put it down!!!!!! I'd recommend it to anyone I know
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love it, but it's missing some key songs. There are a few surprises, like a changed line in the epilogue that made me cry. If you want to be surprised in the movie by changed lines and different interpretations on how to sing a song, then you might want to wait on buying this. I'd still recommend buying it eventually though or buying it and storing it until after seeing the movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Entertaining  and always kept me wanting to keep turning the page. There was never a boring  moment and I liked to pretend I was Anastasia at points :)
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Good for kids, my kids enjoy a lot. We are waiting for next seq of this movie.<br />Dram of the movie is good.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great, a good read and lots of history---- fall of giants by ken follett--- can't wait to read the next.Fall of Giants: book one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun, interesting way to keep your brain actively engaged. This game is highly addictive! I absolutely love a game that makes you think. If you enjoy challenging games this is one for you!
B0033TJATW|5.0|Quick delivery, just in time for Christmas. My nephew is going to love this dvd!! Thanks to the MJ game Mr. Jackson has yet another huge fan!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|What a waste of 2 hours. The only funny scenes were the previews.  Bad choice for Mark Walberg.  Wouldn't recommend this to anyone..
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put the book down and read it in one day. The characters are amazing and it definitely kept my interest.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Thought it was very funny. Lots of silly scenes and some great singing. It was a good time...nothing too deep.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I liked it because it was very entertaining and even though it was the same story it had challenges. It was easy, fast and addictive. Great for playing while waiting for your plane to board or while flying. In fact, great for playing any time you have to wait and are bored.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|After hearing an interview with the author, I was very interested in reading the book.  However, I found the book somewhat of a disappointment.  Dr. Alexander presents a case for life after death in unexplained consciousness he experienced during a time when medical tests saw no brain activity.  He is able to debunk medical interpretations rather convincingly.  And he does this, over and over.  I guess I was expecting to hear more a out how his life and the lives of those around him changed as a result of his experience.
0143123173|5.0|I stumbled on the TV series \\"Longmire\\" on A&E this year and really enjoyed it so when I found out that the series was based on Craig Johnson's mysteries, I downloaded the first in the series called The Cold Dish.<br /><br />I think one of the things that makes this book series so interesting is not only the setting in Wyoming but the slightly mystical sense that you get from it as the main character Sheriff Walt Longmire interacts with the Indian nations in the area.<br /><br />Longmire is a long-time sheriff in least-populated county in the least-populated state. He is assisted in his office by two full-time deputies and one part-time deputy. His second-in-command is a Philadelphia transplant named Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti. She moved because her husband took a job with an energy company in Wyoming. Vic is a very capable deputy, a beautiful woman who has a filthy mouth.<br /><br />In \\"The Cold Dish\\" a young man, Cody Pritchard, is found shot near the Cheyenne reservation. Longmire knows Pritchard from an earlier case when Pritchard was one of four high school boys accused of raping a young Cheyenne girl. They beat the charges at that time, but when another of the boys turns up dead, it seems likes someone may be trying to bring them to the ultimate justice.<br /><br />If this sounds familiar, it was also the plot for one of the episodes of the series, but \\"The Cold Dish\\" has a different ending. The characters in the book are somewhat different than the ones on television, but not in any significant ways, except one, which is revealed in \\"The Cold Dish.\\"<br /><br />I am enjoying both and when I finished \\"The Cold Dish\\", I was just as anxious to read the next book as I am to watch the next season of the series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have used this app a few times now. The app is nice and loud and will not stop until i stop the alarm myself. Get this app you will not be dissapointed..
B000H1RFKA|5.0|Great movie, especially if you're a fan of dark comedy. A very entertaining murder mystery with stellar performances by Robert Downey Jr., Michelle Monaghan and Val Kilmer. Kilmer, in particular, steals every scene he's in for his portrayal of Gay Perry.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|this game is so addictive and fun...can't stop playing it. BEST GAME EVVVA BY FAR! if you want a great game this is what you want!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|season three is just as good or better than 2. AMC is doing to graphic novel justice, thanks for making it affordable to watch on Amazon. Beats the hell out of paying for cable! Looking forward to the second half of the season.
B004J64QSI|2.0|I know this review will probably be unpopular, but right from the beginning this play smacks of bad writing.  There's just way too much expository and not enough action.  The characters explain too much. It would have been much better to show us what happens rather than having a character explain how he/she got to where they're at.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game because you can create and breed so many diverse dragons.  It's vividly colors and cute dragons fun to see and play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I kept hearing that the best out of the trilogy was the first one. I heard the other two were really boring but after reading Catching Fire I see that it wasn't boring at all. I quite enjoyed it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Well thought out. Just a bit flat at the end. Could have been finished better. A good quick holiday read.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|The game is so AWESOME my friends and I love the game it is just so awesome when I'm stuck somewhere I pull out my kindle and play
0547564651|3.0|He doesnt give much in the way of deep insights and devotes far too much of the book to talking about things like chess, when he could really get to the point much faster. If you only read the last two pages, you'll get mostly what he wants to say.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is probablythe best book i have ever read. It is so interesting and emotional. And im only 13. I would recommend this book to anyone, even children. Do yourself a favor and read this phenomenal book, Life Of Pi.
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|I purchased the  Kindle version of the Pocket Sky Atlas and it would not load either on my Kindle or PC Kindle Reader. I had no problems with returning it to Amazon and receiving a refund.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This was another good book by Dan Brown.  Without spoiling the story, I'll just say that it takes place essentially over the course of one day, which I found quite interesting.<br /><br />It includes intrigue, plot twists, and plenty of action.  However, like many books written today, it seems to be written more like a movie concept that pure literature.  I don't think making money off of one's work is a bad thing.  I just wish it wasn't so obvious.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Good game so far.  no need to buy anything from the store for real money yet.  just need to be patient.
B0054VVRBQ|2.0|I hate writing reviews that are not positive and glowing, but I have to this time.<br /><br />PROS<br />This ExpressCard adapter and the SD card fits flush. This totally awesome.<br /><br />CONS<br />1. This adaptor is totally marred by the fact that the computer does not recognize the drive each time you reboot your computer. As a result, you have to stick the adapter in and out each time you reboot your computer. Since the adapter is flush, it's actually quite difficult to stick in and out each time. Besides, this hassle brings wear and tear.<br /><br />2. I filed a support ticket on the Transcend website and have not heard back in over 4 days.<br /><br />I'm using a Dell Studio 14z with the latest BIOS.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Taylor Swift rocks! Her voice is soo melodious! All the track sounds equally sweet! I love Taylor! She is my best female singer!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|enjoyable way to spent an afternoon ... G5 games never fail to be worth the money spent ... good storyline and the puzzles were about average ... all in all an HOG that is great for beginners or those just wanting a relaxing game with a spooky stoty... I liked it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I wish I could've waited for the sale. can I get my 1 dollar back!? I like the game and all but, I'm kinda mad now.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Not for me!! A car that eats people?? I don't think so.  I just wish Mr. King would stick to normal stories, like Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, etc. This is when he is at his best. I cannot tolerate these rediculous &#34;horror&#34; stories. Sorry I don't like obejcts coming to life.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My 11 year old daughter (and myself) are rabid Hunger Games fans. I got this for her as a Christmas present. When I opened the box I was thrilled. It does resemble the actress that played Katness a little. It does still have the Barbie doll glam look but not so much as to be too much. I was expecting the typical generic Barbie face so I am pleased. She hasn't come out of the box but I can see that her accessories are on the delicate side. We will be keeping this away from my daughters 2 year old twin syblings that's for sure! I already know that this will be my oldest's prized Barbie. The best part it the anticipation-i can't wait to see my daughter's face on Christmas monring! She doesn't even know they make a Katness doll. She is going to be over the moon. The outfit is perfect and the bow and arrows really complete the doll and make it Katness and not just a generic Barbie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always like to play solitaire and this is a good game.  I have not used it on the Kindle because I returned the Kindle.  My daughter got something else for Christmas.  But I played the trail game and enjoyed it.
B009MO5G90|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!!!! Milla kicking zombie butt, bullets whizzing by your head, all the action is spectacular!!! Trully!!!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Found this book a little hard to get into to start with but once I did it was a great read.  Look forward to further books by this author
B007SO31BQ|5.0|I am a fan of good documentaries and this one is great.  I actually was a fan of F1 back in the 80s and 90s and this story is amazing.  The entire movie is actual footage, not a bunch of reenacted scenes.  I wish there were more documentaries done in this way.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|And this makes getting news and social stuff easy and timely great app. I am even using it to get google reader feeds and full interaction with google + and Facebook all in one place plus it looks like a magazine which is nice.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|this game is so much fun!  As you complete each chapter it gets harder. Be sure you look closely and at the top for many of the scenes.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|good Sigma novel!<br /><br />It's fast paced, combines history and science - just as I like it. Would buy next novel as well.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Blocks Classic is a fun and addictive game similar to the old Break-out game. You get an extra ball for every level you complete, but the higher levels are pretty fast, and when you run out of balls, you have to start over at the first level--and that is frustrating.
098555780X|5.0|I was looking for a religious cross necklace pattern. this book did not have it but I did learn many other techniques and found the cross pattern on the web site!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a great family game. Everyone from the grandkids to the adults have a lot of fun with this game.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this game is just like ice age and organ trail so yah so if u liked ice age village or organ trail
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a surprisingly good book.  I had a hard time putting it down and I don't like violence but there wad more to the story...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had this app for some time while I save up enough money for a new computer and  this gave me the patience I needed. I have Windows XP and what sux is that  it didnt have enough memory for minecraft PC. So while I waited, this really occupied my time. So I really wanted to reccomend this game to anyone who can not get minecraft PC or 360, for one reason or another. :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is my second book i download. This Bible is so complete i download one before but after downloading this one, i deleted the other.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is an example of how a simplicity doesn't mean you lose either information or elegant, intuitive design.  GREAT JOB!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another block buster. China as the villain and the campus crew in action makes me wish they were real! The story is fast moving and a sure &#34;can't put down&#34; read. You have the return of President Ryan Sr. and Jack Jr trying to do what is best, with John Clark as backup; it makes for a great mix for spine tingling, pride building reading. Another Tom Clancy must read..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Older games with a new twist. Great fun, you can only contine if you get through the first set of games with a high enough score. Which is really cool. Makes you detirmined to do good and get to the next set of games.  Really FUN!!!!!! If you don't have it give it a shot, it's free!!!!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Good book that really captures the reader.  Reminded me of the hunger games a lot. Hope to read the next one soon as the ending leaves much to be desired....
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|The Expendables is a great action movie starring Sylvester Stallone. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis have cameo appearances. There is subtle humor throughout the entire movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series was amazing a must read for everyone it will defiantly keep the whole family engaged you'll love all three books
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles, but with kids and not a lot of table space, they aren't practical. This app has been a great way to get my fix without taking up physical space.  I do wish it kept a record of which puzzles you have completed or saved your progress if you have to exit out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I Loved It From the Start!!!!!  It is so different how some people fall in love so FAST with different people!!!!
B00005K3O4|5.0|I watched this with my daughter and her best friend and they immediately fell in love with this crazy movie. Who knew cotton candy and popcorn could be so dangerous?
B007SGM084|5.0|Everyone that has read these books have been dreaming that their love life is just like it!!!!!  So watch out MEN your wifes are going to want to try everything!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like this app.  Very nice and BIG numbers :) I am happy with this fantastic amazingly wonderful app.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it from the Start!!!!  All the ups and downs that they had to go though!!!!!  Can't wait for another book!!!!!
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I just downloaded this app thinking I had enough data to play but it. said need more Mb I just deleted it also so please fix this and iwill rate it 5stars next time and to whoever wants to buy this app Please Don't waste ur money
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing a classic style RPG that I hadn't played since the 90's.  The game is a little on the easy side if you are used to these kind of games and the world is a little small but the game is very fun and the controls work pretty well.  Ultimately anyone who used to play the FF series from its early days on Nintendo will enjoy this game.  I would really like to see more final fantasy games brought to the Kindle fire or even other early Square Enix RPGs in general.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is t he best book I've read since I've been born!!! I would recommend it to every one I know
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think this is so cute. my daughter and I just love playing this game. I wish I could find more games just like this.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Title says it all - this movie was so cool in the movies and is still cool at home as well. It was not just a comic book but it developed the characters as well as the pop in action.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|kept me enthralled, just as the first one did and I finished in record time, wanting more .... yet again!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The characters come alive with Ken Folliet great style. He has written a complete first part of the trilogy I can't wait to read on!!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|As the last of the trilogy, I couldn't wait to find out what happened. An appropriate ending - so now the story is over!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am VERY pleased with this backpack.I am able to store my Canon SLR,two lenses,my Zensa Bronica with two film backs and lens,film, filters,lens hoods and etc.!!!<br />It compares favorably with backpacks costing five times as much!!!!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|How fabulous was this book! Having heard so much about the story, I kept an open mind whilst reading. However,. I loved it, and loved the whole trilogy. Was disappointed that the story had to end. Will now go & see the movie!
6300274187|5.0|what could be better than Mary Poppins! The singing, the dancing, the musical score is the best! All children will grow up finer for this movie....very enriching.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I listened to their first album over and over again, so I of course had to have Babel! It certainly did not let me down.  It's full of the soul-felt music and poetic lyrics that make Mumford & Sons stand out from the mainstream.  It's definitely worth trying to track down an album with the bonus tracks (13-15).
B00390BE7G|5.0|I have been an on again off again vegetarian for years and loved this non preachy look at the industry.<br /><br />It seems balanced and non judgemental and follows his journey to understand better the food industry. Since reading this, although I still am unsure about my convictions I have just found that I no longer eat animals at all.<br /><br />This is a great read for people who have an interest in the welfare of animals (and the human race) but are not looking for a guilt trip which comes with much vegetarian and vegan literature.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This is a great value.  It has all the big hits, along with some songs I'd never heard before.  It was a great way to educate myself on some timeless tunes!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Phenomenal as always.  One of the absolute best shows on TV!!! Will be sorry to see it finish.  Best of the Best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|a game that looks really easy bit is hard and fun. tun jump slide to different sides it is awesome
B00AECGQF2|4.0|really amazing the only reason it is four stars is beacause it took a little to download. but other than that it is a great kid friendly app
B009MO5960|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The 3D is on par with Afterlife with some nice depth and some cool pop outs. There is one scene though were the CGI looked really, terribly fake (the car and the subway scene), so I took a star off for that cause it was really distracting. The opening is just badass and the creatures look fantastic.<br /><br />The story is pretty good, with lots of action, and a wide variety of zombies. This one is a little different than the others because the story take place underwater, which is a nice fresh take and returns to its roots by once again being underground. There are quite a few returning characters also, which is always a good thing.<br /><br />Overall very entertaining and any fan of the series should greatly enjoy it. Can't wait for the next one!
0446573027|4.0|Baldacci created an exciting new character for what will probably also be an exciting new series.  John Puller, the hero, is a military man that can do it all.  His enemies underestimate him, and it is fun to watch him win.  The story is exciting with many mysteries to keep the reader engaged.  While not the best of the genre, it was a fun read, and I recommend it to anyone that wants to get away from the normal,  and to experience mystery and excitement.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|The whole family really enjoyed this heartwarming movie. This movie is like a rollercoaster it makes you happy, sad, and worried all for a little chimp you have never seen tell now, but you will completely fall in love with him from the start. He goes through alot so early in his life.<br /><br />It is amazing to be able to watch these chimps in the wild, and how much they care for each other. It is really something to see how smart they are.<br /><br />My one gripe about this movie would have to be Tim Allen's narration. He just didn't do that great of a job, some of his jokes, if you want to call then that, just fell flat, and kind of interrupted the story.<br /><br />Overall though you have to see this movie! You are guaranteed to fall in love with it and watch it more than once.
1419705849|5.0|These books are so funny to read and I can relate to this character. Can't wait for the next book.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|this is a great film, too many trolls are dropping one star reviews on amazon so i have to get in here and balance it out. i would have given it five stars anyway though. it's painstakingly hand animated and beautifully realized. the best thing Tim Burton has done in years for sure. great for the whole family, please check this out and support the dissapearing art of stop animation. also check out Paranorman, released the same year. another great stop animated film.
B0018OAOQC|5.0|This is a great album like all of Volbeats albums. They're the best band out there today and put on a great live show if you get the chance to see them.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Works just like a calculator should. I had no problems with this app and it was free.<br />Can't beat free!
B001RXB4FY|5.0|This is a great album like all of Volbeats albums. They're the best band out there today and put on a great live show if you get the chance to see them.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|When I first saw Kelly's audition on American  Idol, I said \\"She is the winner\\".  Well she did and she never fails to come through.  This album brings back all her greatest as well as new hits.  Love love love Catch My Breath.<br />Kelly is the greatest female vocalist of this century.  And her music is lasting.  Every song is a memory.<br />Love you Kelly.
0316187216|5.0|Abercrombie's wonderful \\"real-world\\" Middle Earth continues to develop rapidly. In this volume, familiar old names (and favorites) resurface; few surprises there. Remarkably little interference from Bayaz, the Machiavellian Gandalf, but his buddy Zacharus is running around to mysterious purposes. In the Near Country and Far Country, unlike the Shire, frontier \\"civilization\\" and industrialization are taking hold, and no one seems overly inclined to \\"cleanse\\" them. Even the oldest caretakers of the land, legendarily set up by Euz himself (their possession of Kanedius's swords would seem to confirm those legends), find that they have woefully underestimated their foes. Real people with real limits are tested to those limits and then some; not everyone survives the strain.<br /><br />And \\"Lamb\\" rides off at the end to fight another day, if Abercrombie's faithful readers are lucky.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Place aside your concerns that this is just some movie about a Guy and a Teddy bear.  The romps of this bear and his best friend make this one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Children should never have to realize they're mortal but the world is not fair. This story will make you cry and remind you that life is a gift that should not be wasted.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|This is my 2 year old's favorite movie.  We've had it on our DVR for a year and finally broke down and bought it on DVD.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book! Read it read it read it read it read it read it read it read it!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a very cute movie.  We ended up watching it twice the day we got it.  My boys loved it.  Very nice to have a non-super girly princess.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Thiis is possibly the worst book I have ever read. A total waste of my time. I was happy I didnt have a hard copy to dispose of. It would have gone straight into the trash.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|I am giving Convict Conditioning four out of five for now based on its potential to help me get fit. I am reserving the right to revisit this review in a few months time. I will be using the program as described as well as cardio (treadmill) to see what it can do for me.
B008D36INE|1.0|It sucks.  Hate to see the original. Need to watch 2 or 3 great movies to erase this dog from my mind.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|Es ist total süß. Aber es als Gratisapp am 22.Dezember ist schon ein bisschen blöd. Aber sonst ist alles schön.
0452295548|5.0|This is a great book. I bought if for my daughter-in-law. She found it very helpful and informative as her mother was suffering<br />from a stroke.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|No words can do this book justice, but I will try any way...amazing, phenomenal, genius, fantastic, emotional, beautiful, awesome, incredible, stunning, wonderful, brilliant, and maybe one more....WOW!
0062200909|4.0|Received this last weekend.<br /><br />I am fan of the 4 artbooks that were released for the Lord of the Rings books. You can still easily find them on Amazon, they are by Gary Russell, compiled with the help of WETA. I'm also a big fan of WETA's artbook \\"Crafting Narnia\\".<br /><br />To my mind, this new and superb looking Hobbit artbook is on equal terms with the Narnia book, and probably with the LoTR artbooks as well. The one thing that led me to detract one star and which makes it fall short of perfect for me, is that they skimped on beautiful digital renders and film stills, when it came to Bag End and Rivendell.<br /><br />Maybe they thought \\"hey, we've already been there in LoTR, let's just show the intricate drawings for this one rather than the finished GCI work\\". This buyer of the product finds that a shame, as Hobbiton and Rivendell are two of the most glorious places visited in film 1 \\"Hobbit: Unexpected Journey\\", and we should have been given various gorgeous shots of the places. They've now gone for pencil drawings, by and large, which are nice, but they should be in addition to the beautiful CG renders that you see in the actual film.<br /><br />However that is the only niggle I would have. Otherwise, the sections on the Dwarves and Radagast are highlights of the book. Glorious. I also find the chapter \\"High Fells\\" interesting, speaking as it does about Gandalf and Radagast's investigation of the actual tombs of the Nazgul, after the Rivendell White Council scene. It seems to have been a stirring scene, with Gandalf ultimately finding all of the tombs empty, and opened from the inside. This scene has been cut from the theatrical edition of the film, so I hope it is in the extended edition. It gives us more of an idea as to what we can expect from the Necromancer in film 2, having gathered all his servants to him.<br /><br />This book is not to blame for the fact that a lot of the good stuff in the Hobbit, such as meeting mighty Beörn and the MirkwoodElves, has been moved to film 2. The quality of this first book is so good that you can only marvel at the Desolation of Smaug artbook, sadly still a year away.<br /><br />Finally, it seems there will be more than one WETA artbook per film, in a move away from the LoTR films. There is already another WETA artbook in the Hobbit series coming out in April/May, called \\"Creatures and Characters\\". What on Earth is supposed to be in that I do not know, as this book is already full of detailed drawings and paintings of the creatures and characters in the first film, and I could not imagine needing more on that in particular. I am curious.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie.  I love dance and singing movies, so this film had it.  I would recommend to my friends for sure.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I've loved his show for years, and know  a lot of his story because of how he shares himself on the air - this back ground look at the struggles he went through is fascinating and well written.
B0074JODP8|5.0|What great fun listening and watching this amazing talent!  This one will get played over and over....with the only solid competition for listening time being his earlier DVD from his England concert at Royal Albert Hall.  Good solid video work along with good sound...a can't miss purchase.....unless you don't like great technique and passionate playing!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|we got the game because a friend had it on her Kindle Fire.....we had no idea how addictive it would become!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Fun game to play except that I have to agree with some of the other reviews on the small graphics. The small graphics make the player have to use either the hint option often or the player is given an additional 20 points for not hitting the correct object.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|Awesome, tried to get bootleggs of this show in 07', no luck<br /><br />the dvd blows away the cds you get to see/hear all the glory!!!
B002KCO6QA|5.0|If you love science fiction, and you were raised on Blade Runner, 2001, and the like, you will love this.<br /><br />It's rare that sci-fi makes me cry, and this movie caught me off guard.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it, but there is a scene when Sam is in his Harvester, on the Lunar surface, with Earth in the background.... Let's just say I had a lot of empathy for Sam's plight.<br /><br />I was not expecting how good or affecting this movie was, and now it has a place among my favorites.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent or buy this movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the ending of the book to give you more insight on why he wanted her in the first place. I wish there was more.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was my favorite &#34;movie&#34; of the year... totally entertaining with a fabulous cast, especially Judi and Maggie...  I highly recommend it and bought six of them myself for Christmas presents to friends.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Loved it, kept me guessing right up until the end, have always enjoyed Michaels books, will keep buying them for a while
B0041D843M|5.0|Dr. Campbell lays out his life's study of nutrition and how it interacts with disease.  This book is not about fad diets or trendy nutrient supplements, but rather, it is a well reasoned treatise regarding eating habits and disease.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in their health.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I was bored one day so i typed coin an coin dozed came up so I got it and it was the best thing ever so fun and adicting.
1565117875|3.0|I love The Fountainhead, and without reading too thoroughly (my mistake) I bought this on audiobook for my brother for Christmas. The book is awesome, the audiobook from my library is awesome too, it's like 36 hours or somewhere around there, whereas this ABRIDGED version is only 8 hours. I am very disappointed, but Christmas is in 3 days so I'm probably going to end up giving this to him despite the abridgement. I just wonder why the heck abridged versions of books even exist?! And wanted to warn anyone who is considering the audiobook version of this book to make sure you get the unabridged version. I just don't know how they can cut all of that material from such an amazing book?
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game, I am enjoying it. Well worth the money I am having lots of fun with it.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game.  my 3 yr old son and I both play.  we are addicted to it.  we both wait for the other one to finish so we can play.  its very good for when you are waiting and you have nothing to do.  it keeps my son occupied too.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|I can't think of any music by this incredible voilinist that isn't exceptional.  I buy all of his CD's.  He's great to watch as well, very expressive face.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A page turner with enough spins and twists to satisfy completely . More fun than The Firm.  This is a must read.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This is a classic movie that every child should have. This was purchased for my granddaughter for Christmas this  year.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Ferris is still great after all of these years. It is funny, funny, and funny. Ferris and his buds take us back to our high school years.
B005F9TQ4C|5.0|Some of his best songs here. Check out &#34; Changing Of The Guards&#34; and Senor:Tales Of Yankee Power. Great arrangements to accompany the strong lyric content. Love the use of the extra vocal backing. probably not given enough critical acclaim as it deserved back in the day. Bravo, Bob.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Even though the perspective was from the dog, this is not a children's book.  I found myself crying and then uplifted.  I loved the story.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Fabulous, thought-provoking and touching book.  I have read this over and over, and it never disappoints.  My teen aged son loves it too.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|A must watch if your a fan of shows like dexter, californication and Spartacus . Cool modern day vampire show.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I gave my Kindle Fire to my son when I purchased the iPad to use at work. Since then he has been playing with the apps. He rated this 4 stars but wouldn't elaborate to me.
B000YHG72E|5.0|It just isn't Christmas until I have watched Elf each year! Bluray made it even better, I would highly recommend this for your collection or to give as a gift!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Our son was constantly asking to borrow my iPhone to play this game. So when I gave him my Amazon fire, he now had his own tablet to play it on. Surprisingly, now that he has his own, he doesn't play it as much. I guess not having to ask permission to play it takes the fun out of it.
B008M721MS|4.0|so excited to browse my kindle fire tab ^__^ it's so uneasy for me to download an apps can somebody help me?
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I gave my Kindle Fire to my son when I purchased the iPad to use at work. Since then he has been playing with the apps. He rated this 4 stars but wouldn't elaborate to me.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It was better than I expected... Its action scenes  keep on catching your attention... It's one of those movies that could easily be watched again and again!!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great book! Get off your but and Learn something. I'm writing this review because this book changed my life. Enjoy!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|The book seems disjointed and a bit random. All interesting information (dinosaurs, sea turtles, CO2) it just seems like it doesn't quite fit together in a smooth read. Scarpetta fans will want to read it to stay current in the latest relationship developments and character developments but the crimes themselves were lacking.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 5 yr old grandson loves this game. He finds it easy to play for his level and while I don't allow him to play for extended periods of time,he plays periodically .
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|yes it is only $.99 but comparible apps r free and it doesnt even work like it says it should
B0085YNML2|5.0|munch time is so much fun it will blow yous socks off every one should try it  real fun 4 family  MUNCH TIME
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a book that needs to be read.  It is painful and mesmerizing. It taught me a lot about love, pain, wanting and needing. You will be happy to get through this book, but sad it is over.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Ello i am julian c: im 18 years young and a male i live in texas and only looking for friends :3 so add me please my user is HeavenlySalute
0345529057|2.0|This bookset was a Christmas gift.  I thought these would be regular size novels, but they are almost pocket sized books.  Much smaller than I expected and I am disappointed.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Very readable, as are all the Michael Connelly, books. Harry Bosch is an old friend and I was so happy he was back. But I was disappointed with the ending, and thought it was ridiculous, but since I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading this, I will not say specifically what I didn't like about it. ,
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Put movie into numerous DVD players but the movie went black.  Could not view.  Birthday gift no so much !
B006S08RLU|5.0|A great movie with excellent character development about the eccentric habits of ordinary people. Watching Amelie find and pursue her quest in life is most enjoyable.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Unbelievable voices.<br />I live in the USA and found the BGT video on YouTube.  Fell in love with Jonathan and Charlotte right off the bat because I used to be just a big and lacking in confidence as Jonathan.  They are an inspiration to young people all over the world for their desire to stick together and care about one another.<br /><br />All the best to them.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Yann Martell is a talented writer with the ability to surprise the reader with his story right to the end. Couldn't put the book down. Written with style and grace and an incredible eye for the unusual! In the end just don't know which story is true !
B009HEN7LY|5.0|This was an excellent film to wrap up the Men In Black franshise but I would still like to see another after this one.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|The playpad and playpad pro both are completely inoperable with a Galaxy Nexus 7 after the 4.2 update. On top of this, Nyko is not releasing a finished version of their playground software, so the devices aren't really supported. Avoid this product until Nyko gets their act together.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|Great album, now that I have all 3 couldn't be happier.  Can't wait for Billie Joe to get well, and for their next live show.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|It's a little too hard for me  but I am not the best at chess, hopefully this will get me better
B003VPWXRO|4.0|I really liked the book. It was a pretty easy read and it really gave some amazing insights on how an eating disorder works. But the storyline is written in such away that, at times, it comes across a little jumpy. She jumps back and forth between her childhood and adult life at the drop of a hat. And she seems to be skipping bigger chunks of her adult life. But with that being said, she is really good about letting the reader know when she is talking about her childhood versus her adult life. Overall I love this book and enjoyed reading it more than I thought I would. Thank you Portia for sharing this with us.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|It comes complete with interesting characters and a unique and well- described locale. I can' t wait to read the next book in the trilogy
B006RXPTNM|5.0|Awesome cinematography, excellent acting, timely messages--well worth a watch. This is one that my wife and I return to again and again.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is Victor Hugo at it's finest. I read this book in French many years ago and the translation is excellent.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game. It's quite fun. I take really fun cuz I'm running it. It's great that it'll give me something to always play.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good summary of WW11 styled in a personal way.  Keeps your interest with some nice twists and turns.  If you like history I would read.
B005WM7D0G|5.0|I enjoyed this book, especially since it was recommended by one of my sons.  He felt it did him a lot of good and so do I.
0316069434|5.0|Absolutley captivating from start to finish.  Connelly and his wonderful character, Harry Bosch, are always a pleasure to spend time with.
1609611543|3.0|I struggle with the whole dietary impulses of our country. We are fad-driven dieters and I'm always skeptical of the \\"newest wave\\" of 'don't eat this,' or 'eliminate that.'<br />Authors always have something gain, and that causes skepticism from me as well.  That is not to imply this author has written this book for monetary gain, but he is getting monetary gain from it. I digress.<br /><br />The book: it's decently written and appears to be fairly well researched. Dr. Davis seems to have found some links with how the type of wheat we now consume (high gluten content) is negatively effecting our health in general --- and I find his proposal interesting.  I do believe there to be some truth in his research...but I don't know to what extent.<br />It doesn't take much mental acumen to know that the average American diet is severely lacking in basic nutrients (best found from plants), and that we over-consume on a lot of bread-based products filled with empty calories.  I also have a family member that appears to have an allergy to gluten (hence my initial interest in this book).  I'm also not usually convinced by folks losing weight on any diet (the supposed \\"results\\" many like to tout).  Anyone eliminating a major food group will inevitably lose some weight, and many might lose a lot of weight.  I do believe eliminating a lot of bread-based products like: pop-tarts, cereals, cakes, cookies, fast-food etc., is always a good idea, nutritionally speaking, and if you lose weight, even better.  I'm not going to go into the details of the book --- I do think it's worth reading, if only to broaden your perspective and to have some insight into the 'gluten-free' craze.<br /><br />One thing I'm not convinced of is the supposed 'blood sugar spikes' that come from eating say, two slices of bread.  The theory proposed, I'm over-simplifying his theory here, is because of the high gluten content in the wheat grown, manufactured and consumed today,  your blood sugar will \\"spike\\" after eating (for instance) a couple pieces of bread. I have normal blood glucose levels (60-100) and have found my blood levels are not altered (at all) with my carb intake. I trialed this theory with as many things as possible over several weeks.  The only time my blood glucose truly \\"spiked\\" was after consuming something that had high-fructose corn syrup in it.  This is not my soap-box for putting down any food product, I'm just sharing my personal results.  I ate two slices of bread and would check my levels, one, two and three hours post consumption = all three times (and with several other store bought, wheat-based options - cake, cookies, etc.,) my glucose levels maintained within normal limits.<br />It's plausible I have an incredibly high functioning pancreas, but I'm doubting this.<br />I believe Dr. Davis is on the right track, but I think there are more variables than he has personally listed.<br /><br />Not sure I'm doing much for his book here -- these are mere thoughts after reading his book.  I like aspects of it, but am (obviously) not 100% convinced of all he proposes.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Finally upgraded to a wireless printer; a Deskjet 3250.  Auto configured printer. Prints files including Pdf. You need to open the files through HP eprint or another doc app like QuickOffice Pro.  Not integrated with emails though.
B005CRQ2IU|2.0|Graphic novels are one of the varieties of books that my co-ed book club likes.<br />I was initially happy to find this for the Kindle, but it's tiny to read.  I would recommend at least a big iPad or on a big screen monitor.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Game is slow going, but fun to play. Watch coins and stars closely as you use them quickly to buy stuff.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This is an excellent book, but the religious side of it kind of ruined the story for me. As an Atheist, this is a bit too much, so.. It's alright, but not the best.
B000WGUF98|4.0|My drum teacher recommended one of the songs on this album to play along with.  I listened to each of the samples and decided to get the entire album.  Great stuff.
