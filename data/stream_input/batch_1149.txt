0756655307|5.0|Its a great and very nice book. Great to a gift, because of your harcover, color and illustrations! Of course you need to like comics, and even more, love comics. The book includes, if not all of marvel characters, most of them. So if you are interested in only the most famous, maybe this is not your book... But you if you are like me, that grow up reading every marvel comics, you should love that!

B004OFWLO0|2.0|I know, I know, call me a luddite. I'm perfectly okay with that title. But, these recordings, while remarkably clear and free of distracting artifacts, do not in my opinion, represent anything better than the King of the Delta Blues Singers LP's that Columbia released in 1961 and 1970, respectively. They are just \\"different\\".    While I appreciate the extras and alternates that have been found over the years, I simply can't get past the cold, clinical, & sterile sound of these \\"remastered\\" recordings. Granted they sound better than the muffled lifeless 1990 & 1996 Complete Recordings box set. But, they still lack the \\"life\\" of the old LP's. I can't speak for the sound of the original 78's as I don't own them, given their scarcity and cost these days.    In the end, I feel we are left with a revisionist view of Mr. Johnson's work. Just listen to the primary version of Cross Road Blues on this set (not the alternate) and compare it to the 1961 LP. I'm pretty sure its not even the same take.     I really wanted to like this set but alas, I'll continue to enjoy my old records.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|Music should be all like this. This is what we, as costumers, should demand to record companies.  Three boys from ireland dreamed, worked hard and now are collecting all the years of strugle. This album is absolutly amazing from top to bottom.  From You Won't Feel a Thing to Exit Wounds they just contructed songs that portrait situations we all go trough in life.  Five Stars absolutly.
1594488886|5.0|I previously read 'The Kite Runner' from Khaled Hosseini and could not put it down.  This book is equally gripping.  He is a master of transporting you to that location with vivid descriptions and details that let your mind imagine that you are there.  I am not sure if Mr. Hosseini has authored any more books but will look into it.  Not only is it a great story but also a history lesson.  I learned so much of the culture of Afghanistan and feel I am able to understand a bit more what the situation is there now with the US being there.  I can imagine how the Afghani people are thinking and feeling seeing the US and their military might in their country.<br /><br />One thing that sort of bothered me in the book.  There was a long work up and then the book seemed like it came to an abrupt ending.  Would have liked to have him either shorten the beginning and extend the end or at least give more information.<br /><br />Regardless of the aforementioned, it is a great book and I recommend it.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|Not trying to bash items made in China, but rather trying to avoid them.  Try as I did to find out where these multi-tools were made, I read Oregon, and never saw a mention of China anywhere...yet when the item showed up, sure enough right on the Gerber box...\\"Made in China\\"      Please be more upfront with where items are made in the item description, Amazon.
B004XKMEK2|5.0|This is a solid JLO effort. There's a great mix of dance/Red-One songs along with great mid-tempos that take you back to classic urban Jennifer.     Papi and Hypnotico are stand-out dance tracks, along with the worldwide hit On The Floor.     What Is Love? is an amazing, very relateable pop track that easily ranks towards the top of my \\"favorite\\" list.     Other standouts are Good Hit and Starting Over.    LOVE? ranks towards the top of my favorite albums ever.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|Without a doubt, his best CD since \\"Graceland\\". My only problem with this deluxe edition, which includes a DVD is the 3rd selection, \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" (which is supposed to be a live version) on the DVD which is NOT a video but just a vocal which really disappointed me; so much so, where I thought it was a defect and sent it back for a replacement! Same situation with the replacement, so I guess it is what it is as they say. The actual CD is outstanding, my favorite being \\"The Afterlife\\" which to be honest, really made me want to hear the rest of this CD (which I did per the samples prior to purchasing). To be honest, buy the CD only; the DVD, although interesting (at least the first 2 selections) really isn't worth the extra price based on the length of the video's. The music however on the CD is worth every cent! You won't be disappinted.
0800141660|5.0|I have a great appreciation for English literature and English drama.  Sense & Sensibility and Pride & Prejudice with the excellent casts have been well done.  Emma Thompson? No one does it better.  The dvd is in excellent condition and I was very happy to have found this version on Amazon. I am a faithful shopper now!
031261246X|4.0|A great read, although it does take some liberties for dramatic effect, which programmers will notice.    Mainly, it's quite doubtful that nuclear power plants and commercial aircraft run on Windows and/or are not isolated from the Internet.  Still, it has a good pace and I'd love to see this made into a movie... Nicholas Cage and Tom Hanks?
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|One of the most unusual and insightful views of the mechanics of a schizophrenic mind.  It depicts the extraordinary courage of a man who triumphed over mental illness to achieve great things.  Amazing movie!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|After recently seeing the Love show in Las Vegas, upon my return home I ordered the CD/DVD audio, which was much less here than at the show where they were asking about $40.00.    I enjoy the remix and find the audio quality excellent.    The process of ordering is what I expected from an Amazon provider and I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who is considering this purchase.
0553386794|5.0|The setting is the middle ages with knights, royal families, peasants, and some fantasy mixed in, but the story is really a political thriller. Game of Thrones is about the intense political maneuverings of royal families (which can easily be seen as political parties).<br /><br />With the good character development and varied perspectives, it is easy to get attached to particular players, although I found that a friend was rooting for different characters than I was. Tyrion is harder to figure out but provides great comic relief.<br /><br />Games of Thrones is not the typical, predictable novel that gets churned out too often these days. This book has lots of twists and turns and downright shocking events. I don't recall being so surprised by any other novel. Keep in mind that the violence, language, and sexual content are definitely not for kids.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss is a fabulous hero. She feels so real, and it was so easy to get invested in this book, and the whole series. I would highly recommend this book.
B004XUDJII|5.0|The first full CD production of Christina Perri does not disappoints. although it does not have the high vocals and enthusiasm in the live recordings, it is a bit more mellow, but more likely due to the targeted audience.  She still has very nice vocals through all the tracks. I wish she would have recorded more songs, but its a great debut nonetheless. once you hear her voice, it totally disconnects you from the tattooed rocker cover, and transports you to a different place with soothing voices that make you repeat the songs over and over.
B004OKFIYU|4.0|It's Billy Joel, great music, but thought the SACD could have been better.    Found the Turnstiles SACD worth a 5 star rating.    If you can find \\"The Stranger\\" in 5.1, that's the best SACD out there of Billy Joel's    They need to do more multichannel versions, his music is definitely worth the effort
0670022411|4.0|This book had a mild (not slow just mild) start to it.  It was still able to grab me and keep me reading.  Towards the middle of the book I started to feel like we would take two steps forward and three steps back in Diana and Matthew's relationship so that was getting frustrating but kept me reading type of frustration.  I was drawn in the lives of Diana and Matthew and found myself wanting to yell at them sometimes.  This book was very well written, and the story was unique (to me).  My only complaint would be the end of the book seemed to have maybe too much stuff like the book had to be 579 pages vs 500'ish.  O and the fact it leaves you wanting to start the next book and the fact that book is not even published yet :) But I guess that's actually a good thing!
B000PGTPE6|5.0|The Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band 'Live in Dublin' DVD is the finest concert DVD I have ever purchased and one of the finest concert's I have ever viewed - live or recorded! This is arguably the finest 18 piece band/singers ever assembled! Every performer is talented enough to stand on their own, but collectively, they are an incredibly tightly-woven magical machine! It'll blow you away! Buy it ... you'll like it!
B000FC146C|5.0|I'm disabled now. I have finally gotten an ereader, I can't hold books any longer due to my disability, I was looking to purchase Kindle edition or ebooks of The Thornbirds and others, and here it says NOT AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE IN THESE COUNTRIES: United States???????????????    Why not? And why show it in our Amazon store if it's not available to us?    This stinks.   Thanks anyway? Don't know how to end this, other than Disappointed.
B003IWOVN4|5.0|This is a great record and you really should buy it. But with the teeniest bit of French (most of which you can just Google) you can buy a digital download for half of this price at (...)<br />Dunno why you can't do that here.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I first heard Jar of Hearts on the radio a few weeks ago, and immediately loved it.  I went searching for Christina Perri's cd, not realizing it hadn't been released yet.  Then yesterday (the day it was released, unknown by me) I stumbled upon it at the store and bought it right away, just from the strength of the one song, which I *never* do.  I don't like to buy cd's unless I know there are at least two or three songs on there that I like, but I made an exception with this one, and it was well worth it.  Every track is wonderful, with Jar of Hearts being the standout.  If I had to make a complaint about the songs, it's that she only seems to sing about two things: love and heartbreak.  But the beauty of the song and strength of Perri's voice more than make up for that.  Perri has a wonderful voice and is now my favorite female singer.  I look forward to hearing more from her in the future.

B002689ATQ|5.0|Woody Allen seems to have struck gold \\"across the pond.\\"  And his leading actress, Scarlet Johanson,is very convincing as a gold digger, down-on her-luck actress, desperate pregnant cast-off of yet another gold digger, only this one male, in a twisted plot that takes us through twists and turns and ends up with our principle male shrouded in guilt and the stunner of the movie lying dead.  Damn good contemporary drama, the way it might just happen in many \\"higher Circles.\\" Kudos to the principle and supporting cast for a fine mystery thriller.    Old Timer- Doug Simmons
B00012QM86|5.0|good educational movie. Graphic scenes so viewer discretion is advised. The black and white add to the effect of the movie.
B0049VQZUA|5.0|i watch alot of shows all the way through and this series is by far one of the best. It makes you forgot your watching a tv show.
0316056863|5.0|I was ready to be disappointed by this book. Fortunately, after hearing this book (worth it! She narrates and her comedic timing is perfect) Tina Fey remains my idol.     Maybe because I was a middle class soccer kid who grew up in a man's professional world...maybe because I'm a brunette, I dunno, I really enjoyed the book.     I love a prayer for her daughter chapter, and got a kick out of the lessons she learned from Loren Michaels.     Also, her description of her childhood was interesting to me. If you like Tina Fey and always wanted to learn more about her, you won't be disappointed. She is NO Liz Lemon. She is a perfect Tina Fey.    Wait, I also dug her chapter on photo shoots. Great build up.    Download this book -- worth hearing her narrate.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I was not pleased with this last book in the series.  After waiting for over a year, I expected a better put together story, not far fetched imaginings of a writer whos books I been buying and reading for a while.  The plot was weak, the characters that she had taken so long to develope were reduced to weak, emotion driven reductions who I really did not care about.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Im a Virtual DJ with an online presence and let me tell you that after multiple hour sets with other headsets my ears , face and often the top of my scalp often hurt. Iv'e tried multiple sets and each of them had there pros and cons ofcourse. However , After deciding to take the plunge into wireless and drop some cash into a new headset I set my sights on the G930. I can tell you that I will never turn away from it. It hosts a range of options and benefits including increased comfort , range and settings to maximize your experience and requirements. The battery life is spot on and every bit of 10 Hours , plus the ability to talk while charging and a quick charge is a bonus.    They are larger than most but because the ear peices fit over the ears and rest around them you feel no discomfort and it maximizes the surround sound feature.    All I can truly say is .. If you dont atleast consider these as an option your not doing yourself any favors nor are you including what is certainly on of the top quality headsets available.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.<br /><br />The highlight of BLACK SWAN is the presentation of the ballet music and all of the behind-the-scenes tension brought on by the determination of ballet maestro VINCENT CASSEL to find a dancer who can be both The White Swan and The Black Swan with equal expertise. He is impressed by NATALIE PORTMAN's skill as The White Swan but tells her she must experience life and love to the utmost in order to provide the proper passion for her darker side as the evil swan. It's hard to believe that he doesn't spot the flaws in her personality that make her unable to face the demands of the ballet world. However, he's excellent in his role, as is MILA KUNIS as her cunning rival.<br /><br />Portman's mother (BARBARA HERSHEY) seems to be as neurotic as her unstable daughter in a Mommie Dearest sort of way. Their scenes together amp up what we know is bound to be a fatalistic end to an unhappy story. As the rival ballerina, MILA KUNIS provides plenty of jealousy for Portman, already unnerved by the demands that Cassel places on her emoting. Inevitably, Portman is pushed over the edge by all of her hallucinations and insecurities until she falls into a pit of darkness from which there is no escape.<br /><br />Portman's skill as an actress is evident, overcoming any objections some might have to the heavy use of a body double for the difficult ballet moves. She gives her character dimension and pity, despite the unpleasant aspects of the character's irritating personality.<br /><br />Worth a look for the performances alone, but beware that the dark side looms large in just about every scene which some might find too depressing for their taste and the sexual content is close to pornographic at times.pornographic at times.
B00004C4L6|4.0|This music is mad. Absolutely insane, but in a good way.<br />This is the first album of Tangerine Dream, the ambient krautrock dudes.<br />This album is a bit less aimed than their later albums, but it is more of a taste of what is to come.<br />Though I must warn you, this music is not IN ANY WAY for the close minded. If you don't find anything different appealing or things that don't sound normal attractive, then you probably, no you SHOULD skip this album. It's great, but it's much less accessible than TD's later albums like Phaedra and rubycon.<br />Though if you have an open mind and are trying to discover some forms of music that really caught on (or are just trying to hear TD's first album) then this is for you.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|There's so much to say about this movie, but i'll keep it real short.  IT WAS AWESOME!!!!  Watched it again the next day lol.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|ATTENTION: the reason this book gets mediocre reviews is because it only follows about half of the characters. You're not going to read about Bran, Jon, Tyrion, or Dany. You'll read about Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Jaime, Brienne and some new characters I won't spoil. My suggestion is that you wait to read this book until Feast for Dragons comes out this July so you can read them back to back.<br /><br />It's not as bad as it's rating!

0439023483|1.0|I read The Hunger Games because one of my friends (with poor taste in books) recommended it.  When the cashier at Border's told me it was her current favorite, I became a little more hopeful.      The plot is depressingly predictable.  If anyone reading this has half a brain, they would not be entertained.  I have to wonder whether other reviewers are even thinking while they are reading this book.  \\"Girl with low self-esteem ends up being a winner,\\" really?  Isn't this a little reminiscent of Harry Potter?  Collins doesn't even finish the story, another prediction I made about halfway through.  \\"Girl gets physically involved with boy who is unhealthily obsessed with her, while still harboring feelings for boy at home.\\"  Who will she pick?  No one, because writers today don't know how to or don't want to finish their story.  They are only thinking about how they are going to sell the sequel.  The writing does not redeem the plot.  Some lines were so cheesy I had to laugh out loud.  Collins aims high in mimicking 1984 or Brave New World, but the only thing she attains is Twilight or Harry Potter status.      Please don't waste your time, because if you have half a brain, you won't be surprised or thrilled or even mildly entertained by Katniss' predictable triumphs.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Another reader considered the ending &#34;abrupt and dissapointing,&#34; and I agree. Still, long-time fans will recognize this as another Connelly page turner.    If you are new to Connelly and enjoyed this book, do yourself a favor and read his early works.    And for those counting the bucks, I bought the hardcover version rather than the Kindle version. It will be read by at least six people before it is donated to the library.
0887081770|5.0|this s a wonderful story. the smaller size allows me to easily carry it in my bag, and pull it out to share with the children i work with.
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|I'm not privy to what happened to the US release of this album. And frankly, I don't even care. You wanna know where to get this album? Amazon -- that's amazon.co.uk.  I'm glad they don't have \\"regions\\" for Audio CDs!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|I bought Toy Story 3 on Blu-Ray before I got this, and I love all the movies, all I have left to buy is Toy Story 2 Blu-Ray. All three of these movies are pure amazing. The story keeps you into it with just enough humor and minor drama, humorous drama. Recommend to people of all ages and if you see this one or any of them as a matter of fact I highly recommend you see all of them. This is one of the few titles that all of its sequels are actually great and worth the money and lifetime of enjoyment.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|It is a surprisingly fun game. I thought it was stupid when I heard about it, but I got it to keep my young son entertained and tried it myself and actually thought it was fun! Works fine on my thunderbolt, but i havent seen it on any phones to compare. Great if you are looking for a quick fun diversion.
1576754227|5.0|I purchased the audio book from iTunes and really got some good information out of it. This book does not re-invent the wheel but the author puts together a lot of good ideas into one small package. I really appreciate the effort. I recommend this book highly!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Color me baffled by all the negative reviews.  I freely admit to being unfamiliar with Sir Doyle's stories, yet I also freely admit the stuffy, stoic, rather wooden portrayal of Holmes in the Rathbone films never floated my boat.  So this version of SHERLOCK HOLMES delighted me, as here Robert Downey Jr. gives the character an edge; here the super sleuth is disheveled, marvelously eccentric, slightly neurotic, totally violent, and, when the case isn't coming along, or just for the heck of it, Downey's Holmes will get high.  And Jude Law is not your grandfather's Dr. Watson; he's curmudgeonly with a suggestion of rogue grit, and he takes particular delight in his friend Holmes's persistent misfortunes.  (As long as he's not sucked in as well.)  The interaction between the two suggests more of a rugby locker room than a London flat with two gentlemen.  And it's fun to watch.<br /><br />The plot is just silly, Rachel McAdams is misused as bad girl/love interest Irene Adler, and my acute acrophobia made watching the climactic fight scene on the under-construction London Bridge extremely unsettling, but I suffered such inconveniences gladly.  The images of late 19th Century London, the madcap mayhem of Downey and Law (especially when they're pitted against a hulking Robert Maillet in an hysterical fight scene), and Mark Strong as the brooding, evil, sinister villain Lord Blackwood all combined to enhance my enjoyment of this version of SHERLOCK HOLMES.  Will I be watching the soon-to-be-released sequel?  Elementary, my good Watson, elementary.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

1613820100|4.0|Laura, twenty years old, is the perfect Victorian heroine.  She is beautiful and fragile, a bit weak-minded and in need of guidance and protection.  Laura draws passibly and plays piano beautifully.  She is also the heiress to a small fortune.  How could her new art teacher, Walter, not fall in love with her?    What Walter doesn't know is that Laura is already engaged to be married, and her future husband is impatient that the marriage happen before Laura turns twenty-one.  Marian, Laura's ugly but strong, brash, and confident sister, informs Walter of Laura's situation and the two of them agree that Laura's happiness is their first priority.  Although some nervewracking events come to pass, including a mysterious letter that casts doubt on the character of Laura's fiance, Marian remains firm in her belief that this marriage will be best for Laura.    After the honeymoon, when the sisters are again reunited, they see that they have made a terrible mistake.  Laura's husband is powerful and has powerful friends, and there doesn't seem much that two dependent women can do to get themselves out of a bad situation.  Marian always has a plan, but will she be able to outsmart her devious new brother-in-law?    This story was fast-paced and interesting, and I liked the twists it took while working toward a satisfying conclusion.  I liked being able to read sections from the point of view of different characters; I was able to get a well-rounded picture of what was going on and of the people involved.    I found Laura an uninspiring main character, but was interested enough in the others to overlook her more annoying character traits.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Is there any person out there who would not give this movie a perfect score? Anybody who watched this movie all the way through as it slowly gave up its secrets must agree that this was very masterfully put together. DiCaprio always picks the most interesting and complex roles. This was a lovely film that was also very clean. The depth of the plot is unrivaled!! at least thats what I am inclined to say. Even after watching this movie it deserves to be watched again and again because of the deep metaphysical nature of the subject matter.

B000TXNDUW|5.0|As another review said, \\"There was film before Breathless, and film after Breathless.\\"  It's hard to see how revolutionary it was to take the camera out of the studio and off the tripod, and film actors in the streets.  Famously, Godard said, \\"All you need to make a movie is a gun and a girl.\\"  Breathless is the physical incarnation of that statement.  How cool is Belmondo?  How hot is Sebring?  Brilliant dialogue and camera work, as well as outstanding performances, reveal that this movie still works as a breath of fresh air and a kick in the ass to all lazy film makers (and critics) out there.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|such a simple physics game engine. i can't believe that a franchise that has made so much money off downloads and merchandising can't meet deadlines for updates. repeatedly this game disappoints android users. it's not like they are trying to update gta4 within a 2 month period. this is crush the castle for petes sake. if you want any angry birds games i'd suggest an iphone. rovio tends to favor and cater to apple users.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Just recently purchased this item for a foreign car being used in the Caribbean.  The car has a place to put in an auxiliary jack but it would be too expensive to do so.  Did quite a bit of research on auxiliary devices and found that most of them such as Monster, Belkin and Griffin do not have the reviews that the Satechi does.  Was skeptical about it but decided that with the amount of good reviews, it may be worth a try.  Must say that it lives up to it's word and then some!  This device is worth the price and the sound that comes out of it is great! Did a small test on my '99 Honda CRV in the USA and it performed flawlessly before taking it down to the Caribbean.  Yes, there is some noise on occasion and that's the be expected however, I must note that the noise is not really noticeable at all. I plan on buying another one for the '99 Honda soon.      You owe it to yourself to get this device, you will not regret it!
B002ZBN13A|5.0|I realize I'm reviewing this 8 years after its release... but that's just how good I think Fallen is. This is my favorite of all the albums I own, by any band.  Pros: Amy Lee's beautiful voice; excellent composition by Ben Moody, Amy Lee, and the rest; solid all the way through; creates virtually its own new genre. Very melodic, dark, combination of Amy's vocals, rhythm guitar, and piano. Also, the songs \\"Going Under,\\" \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" really stand out as hit songs in my opinion. The rest are only a notch below.  Cons: Umm... that the band split up after this album. I can't think of any other real downsides. Unfortunately, Ben Moody left Evanescence, along with a couple of other members, after Fallen. They eventually started their own band, \\"We Are the Fallen.\\" You may want to check it out... But that's another review.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Life is an absolutely fantastic video!  I saw one of the producers speak at a conference, and several clips were played while he described the process of making the video (3 years, 70+ expeditions to all corners of the Earth, 3000 some hours of video shot).  The clips were so stunning, I ordered the video to watch it all at home.  I asked my 7 year old son to watch with me;  he wasn't interested.  I said \\"watch it for 5 minutes;  if you don't like it, you can go do something else\\".  Three hours later, we had to stop watching to get some dinner.  I purchased another copy for my father, and he was thrilled as well.    This is not a boring nature video, this is an absolutely captivating, expertly shot and narrated, wondrous story of Life on our planet.  Not to be missed.

The Patrick Ruthfuss' [[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 2)]]Kingkiller series is just like a week of vacation from the mundane real world.

B004LAIU4I|5.0|Yes, it is probably his best since Graceland, but it is no Graceland. As Elvis Costello hints on his notes, writing beautiful, simple yet elegant music in these times may be considered \\"out of fashion\\", and yet, as the reviewer \\"Head Butler\\" says, this work by Mr. Simon appears, as if from nowhere and apparently without effort when it would be easier to write about what Costello calls \\"darkness\\". Why is it so hard for us to accept beauty for what it is? Can't we see that real, lasting \\"beauty\\" is so much more difficult to attain, and even so much more without pomposity or exhibitionism?     I've always have my doubts about Dylan. Sometimes it seems like he just kept playing a role he found himself trapped into and didn't know how to evolve gracefully (I know, this is purely my own humble opinion, and I don't want to sound arrogant at all). But, on the other hand, Simon has been more of a risk-taker with much less \\"humble\\" material, since he started his own solo career, and has this uncanny ability to turn apparently simple phrases, also without an apparent initial \\"sense\\" into intertwining combinations of humor, tenderness and, above all, keen observations that make every day situations or occurrences seem extraordinary. This is what a poet does. Sometimes he remembers me of Pablo Neruda, writing out of pure, pure instinct. This time he's just celebrating his maturity and sharing it with us in a totally candid and sincere way. He's not forcing anything, he's not being a prophet, he's just saying it like he sees it, at 69, and if it seems not to be profound, so be it. Maybe it's not, and this is the beauty of it. But it is not ever silly, mostly because there aren't many people who can resonate without a huge speaker, so to speak, like him.  And this is why this is no Graceland. Graceland was a great album, but it had that very conscious \\"planned\\" sense to it (not a bad thing) not unlike Sgt. Pepper. \\"So Beautiful, So What\\" is casual and relaxed but it stills managesto awaken a sense of curiosity that can only come as when one is confronted with one of those riddles that once deciphered one feels like \\"why did it take me so long to figure it out\\".     If I were to describe this work in one word, it would be \\"different\\". Plain, simply, freshly and above all, timelessly different. In a very good way.     But... it shares something with Graceland after all: it will remain playable a million times over.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I enjoy the Harry Potter movies, and waited for this one to come out on DVD. I pre order it and recieved it on the day it was released. I enjoyed it except for the running theme in all these movies, there is so much in the books there is know way to get it all in the movies, but I still enjoy them. The characters feel like old friends.
B004SCN2F6|3.0|The game is super complex for a phone game, and there's a lot to do and explore.  But after playing it for a few hours, the lack of a storyline got to me and I stopped playing.  Also one time I made a critical mistake in a battle and was not able to dig out of the hole of bankruptcy, mutiny, and getting destroyed by pirates.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|Bought this device to use on the plane with my ipod touch 4g and my Shure IEM E535. I use the FIIO-E3 LOD cable to connect my touch with the e7. No issues works as advertised. The user interface is pretty easy to understand. The unit is pretty snall, just a little shorter than my ipod touch but twice as high. The unit is pretty sexy looking with the black metal case and comes with a display protector. My only complaint, the unit came with a bad USB cable. According to the MICCASTORE.COM support people, they are sending me a new cable. In the meantime I am using my own cable and everything is fine. So far I am pretty satisfied with my purchase, the two day shiiping was great. I ordered the unit on Saturday and got it Tuesday. Overall I'm a happy camper. Now I see how this unit holds up to my weekly plane flights.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I probably would not have gotten this if it weren't free, but boy am I glad I did.  This calendar app has a galore of settings that will help you customize your calendar exactly how you want it.  The different colors, sizes, views, and easy to use UI make it one of the best phone calendars I've seen.
B000000OUW|5.0|Great songs. All old school sound and great workout tunes. I am so glad I learned of ManOWar and will add them to my MP3 workout tunes as long as I am able too! I can't believe these guys never made it to the mainstream!!!
0307716988|5.0|i love this book and the photos in it are beautiful and the story about his life and his family wow i cant believe that really happen as child and michael was right he have much of a childhood and but at lease he knows what it was like to a child and some people like to do childish things and some don't.  If you a fan of michael jackson this the book worth buying.
6303442846|5.0|I doubt I can add more superlatives than other reviewers have.  This is a delight (no pun intended) to watch over and over again.  The period music is as interesting as any of it.  \\"Keep Your Sunny Side Up\\" by Johnny Hamp with vocalist Joe Cassidy and the Kentucky Serenaders (the closing theme) is as innocent as the time and the characters by today's corrupt and still decaying standards.  I actually found a vinyl copy of the soundtrack on eBay several years ago and this tune is on my iPod.  As Paul McCartney said, \\"I like this kinda hot kinda music!\\"  Give it at listen at [...] unless AMZN snips the link, otherwise search for the title on YouTube.      But that's beside the point.  Madeline Kahn was unbelievably, incredibly gifted (also no pun intended for Blazing Saddles fans) and steals the show IMHO.  Tatum O'Neal had no business being in this movie other than her daddy's connections, but it worked out better than anyone could have imagined (especially for those of us who, at the time, remembered Nancy Sinatra's brief claim to fame).  P. J. Johnson was so believable as Imogene that I thought I was flashing back to my privileged white-boy childhood in Alabama in the early 1960s, where Stepin Fetchit would have still fit right in.    In my view this is Mr. Bogdanovich's sweet and savory masterpiece, the best he's done.  That's not to put down \\"The Last Picture Show\\" or \\"What's Up Doc?\\" or \\"Daisy Miller\\" - it's just saying a lot about \\"Paper Moon.\\"  By all means, if you haven't seen this yet, jump on it and keep your sunny side up!
0064430227|5.0|Three generations of my family have enjoyed this book, starting with me, then to my sons, and now to my grandchildren.  A book that timeless - what can I say?
B000JQUGVI|2.0|I stopped reading this free edition when I came to location 568. At this point of the ebook there is a section of repeated text - about six to ten paragraphs repeat. I was a little concerned that if this free edition contains repeats - does it also contain omissions? I'd hate to read this 12,000+ location ebook and wonder all along if I were missing important text.<br /><br />I decided to purchase the illustrated version offered by Art & Poetry Publishing. That ebook does not contain repeat text at the spot mentioned above and the illustrations are coming through nicely. Small, but a nice addition to the story.<br /><br />:-) I don't work for Art & Poetry Publishing - I just feel a solid ebook file is necessary, even when it's free.<br /><br />Jenna
0061134007|3.0|The new Girl With.... This ain't.    It'shard to follow, unless you can distinguish between similar sounding first names for both men and women.  It jumps around history a lot.  And might I add an opinion that it ever so gently glorifies nazi history in the guise of a love story (that turns to murder....well, maybe that is a bit of a stretch)    There's a germ of a good book here, but it's all together most decidedly not all that.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|The dvd arrived when it was promised and I was anxious to view it.  Losers did entertain me but I was expecting a bit more to be honest.  I was expecting something along the lines of a Rocka Roller but overall I wasn't disappointed other than having one of the stars killedat the end.
031606792X|5.0|It came on time and looked complete new.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|I suppose the special effects are ok here. I just don't get too excited about these types of films. This was a 2001 vehicle for the then slightly less famous Angelina Joli whose main claim to fame here are her enormous breasts and overly plumped fish lips. She is not a bad actress, really, but you would think she would opt for slightly more cerebral films. I guess she likes money. Poor Daniel Craig has nothing whatsoever to do here pre-James Bond. If you are 15, or have the maturity of the same, then you may enjoy this silliness.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Nothing like a GREAT belly laugh on a not so perfect day.  This season is sure to put a smile on any face :).  Modern Family is the best new sit com....hope it has a L-O-N-G life!!
B004GHNHVW|3.0|I'm a little disappointed.  Up to and including Graceland, everything Paul Simon has recorded has been (to me, at least) exciting, innovative, and soul-capturing.  He has evolved, as we all do, and to me his music from the past 10 years seems more cerebral and almost less musical. Maybe it's just me...
B003FXXNH6|5.0|the movie itself is great, and if you are a martial arts lover this is just for you, Scott Adkins is a great athlete.
B000QE1U9K|1.0|People are saying that Alien Resurrection was the weakest,... I very much disagree.<br />Alien 3 was the weakest in my opinion:<br />WARNING: Spoiler alert....<br />1. The characters Hicks and Newt who fought through all they did to<br />survive in the second movie die at the very beginning?!?! Come on David Fincher!!!<br />2. The characters are a bunch of foul-mouthed former prisoners?!?!<br />3. The only character I actually cared about in this movie was Ripley,<br />but even she dies at the end! Along with pretty much every other main character!<br />I didn't like this movie! David Fincher relied on this movie being the final chapter too much!<br />I honestly wanted to see them develop on Ripley and the queen alien inside of her<br />more... So I thought Alien Resurrection was entertaining! True, Ripley was a clone in that movie<br />but clones are people reborn, so they can't completely have all their memories, but she still<br />proved that she was a strong woman! But I still didn't like this movie at all! But that's my opinion.
B001UW58WW|2.0|I wasn't at all impressed with this particular CD.  Guess I picked the wrong one because I wouldn't give you a dime for it now.  We really do like David Garrett, he is simply amazing and so very talented!  I hope to have better luck next time!
B0041KKYEM|3.0|In `Black Swan' Darren Aronofsky depicts the pain a ballerina has to endure to successfully rise to the top of the profession, a similar theme which he had explored earlier in the film ` The Wrestler', this includes little food consumption, lot of body aches and of course sometimes bleeding toenails. Natalie Portman is the ballet dancer who is selected by the director as she embodies the character of the white swan that is innocence but he wants her to play the role of the black swan as well, of deception and intrigue. As she channels her psyche for the black swan, Portman finds that the black swan is taking over her entire persona. Acting by all the leads and supporting cast members was exemplary, Natalie Portman is truly a great actress and Mila Kunis is a revelation. Winona Ryder is surprisingly in form. The movie gathered so many accolades but I found it enjoyable but not great. Three stars. 3/30/2011
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I liked Tina Fey until I read this. I was very disappointed. The writing is excellent, the wit acerbic, but it was very superficial (I don't know why it wouldn't be, most memoirs are) and found the most interesting person in the book to be her Father.  When I finished I no longer cared much about Ms Fey. Maybe \\"bitchypants\\" would have been a better title but I found her to be rather boring. While most memoirs are about the person writing it, I found little likeable in the book and   felt it was written with a heavy hand. Her dislikes are quite vivid but I came away with a generally negative impression, not quite knowing what she LIKES, other than personal accolades.
B004SBX112|2.0|had to uninstall this fun game because it was constantly freezing my galaxy after 10 or so minutes of play. too bad cuz it is fun.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I have a mac book pro and have installed MACenc  along with the maps from Navionics (3xg). When I first plugged the Globalsat 353 into the computer it didnt show up. I called MACenc and they gave me detailed instructions to make sure I was installing it correctly. MACenc's customer service is outstanding by the way. It turns out that I just needed to have the reciever plugged in prior to opening MACenc. Once I did that everything works seamlessly.
0316776963|5.0|i read this book while down with cold - will remember those times with sentiment;) this is the funniest book i've read in a while and i didn't even expect that! i didn't enjoy the first and the last two chapters but all of the ones in between were really cool.
B00509OFE8|5.0|I never followed any of the other SG franchises.   I happened to one day catch SGU, on accident, on Syfy.  My curiosity was piqued.   I watched the entire first and second season on Amazon and was absolutely amazed at SGU.   Outstanding science fiction!  Outstanding character developement!   I am very sad to see this splendind series come to an end.  The closing scene with Eli standing on the observation deck was very moving.   We can only hope this will be picked up by another network or else maybe a series of movies.
0439023521|5.0|The plot may not be entirely new, but taken as a whole, this book and the rest of the series are very much worth reading.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I've always been a Foos fan, and a couple of their early albums even deserve the moniker `Rock Classic'. That said, I found their last two albums mediocre. Sure, there were some stand out great tracks (`The Pretender' and `Best of You' come to mind) but there was too much filler, and I wondered whether Dave and co. would ever get back to the musical heights of `The Color and the Shape'.    Even though my tastes lean more toward Blues Rock these days, I am pleased to say 'Wasting Light' blew away my expectations. There are so many great tracks it is hard to pick a stand out, and only one (Back and Forth) feels like filler. This is the first rock album in years where I can listen to it over and over and not feel tempted to skip tracks.    Openers `Bridge Burning' and `Rope' are rock at its best, with great riffs and hooks, and it's immediately apparent that the whole band are meshing and bringing their A game. The drums, the base, and of course the Foos signature wall of guitars are all at their best. Dave may not be an amazing singer, but his voice swings from melodic to dirty at all the right moments and he sounds as good as ever.    The album continues at a high standard, with anthemic `These Days' and epic `I Should Have Known' being standouts, although there is so much good material here that everyone will no doubt have their own favorite tracks. `White Limo' is a thrashing screaming rocker that reminds me of early Queens of the Stone Age and may be too balls out for some, but is in my opinion a killer track.    If I had to find something to criticize, it would be that Dave's lyrics are not especially inspired, but they're still better than 90% of what passes for rock music these days.
B001NLKT60|3.0|An excellent sequel.  I have had many discussions with fans of Larsson and we all agree that eventhough the writing is solid, there are areas that looked like they were rushed through.  I understand that the editing process can be a tedious thing, but I would have liked to have seen more detail in certain areas.  Overall a good book, but I felt like I would have liked to have seen more.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|love this game. huge fan. never been so frustrated about an app before. 3 stars and prizes found. still cant unlock. the wait better be worth it!!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Great app! Functions perfectly, but why do I find it running in my application list when I haven't launched it? Hmmm, uninstall.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I'm so glad I tried this book!  It got me hooked right from the beginning.  In fact, I put it down once to eat lunch, then dove right back into the story. :)  The plot has already been put out there, so I'll just say I loved the scene where Pia is trying to change into her Wyr form.  I liked that both H/h had to work to earn each other's trust. The credit card scene was great. Also, the fact that Pia has some serious skills is just awesome.  I hate it when a main character is vulnerable all the time.  I do wish that Pia had put a little more smack down on the Harpy sentinel.  I love humor in my books, and Dragon Bound delivered in full.  Parts had me laughing out loud. The secondary characters were really well done.  The interactions between Dragos & pretty much everyone cracked me up.  I enjoy reading from the POV of both Dragos & Pia. I'm very, very excited for the next book to come out!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I remember being so excited when the seventh book was finally published.  It was so bittersweet - wanting to know what happens, but not wanting it to end.  The first half of the book was hard!  It went on and on with little action or excitement.  But then, as I continued to read, I understood that Ms Rowling needed to get us inside Harry's head to set up the final sequence of events and to show that this was no easy Journey that Harry, Ron and Hermoine were on.  That they sacrificed greatly to reach their goal.  The movie, thankfully, was very true to the book.  It was not the easiest movie to sit through as it is a little depressing.  The viewer is taken along with Harry and the gang and it shows how hard it is on them - how easy it would have been to give up.  Of course they do not give up and the next movie will be worth the wait as part one has set the stage exactly as it should be.  Cudos to the director for giving us what we needed if it is not exactly what we wanted!
B004XWLN20|5.0|Lets be honest, this show lasted ten seasons for a reason. Sad to see it go, you'll be sorely missed.
0316056863|4.0|It has many moments of zany, lucid humor with that unmistakable Tina Fey flavor, especially in the first half of the book.  It really cracked me up.  As for the final 1/3rd of the book - I found it a little hard to relate to her struggles to balance motherhood and career, as I am neither a mother, nor do I have a career, and with the economy the way it is, I don't expect to experience either of those challenges.    Not as funny as an episode of 30 Rock, but what is?  It's the only show on network television worth tuning in for and each episode has me laughing out loud from the first moment to the last until my abs ache and I am gasping for breath, just like a spin class but more fun.  It was interesting to get a glimpse into the life of the woman who is responsible for single-handedly rescuing network television from being a complete wasteland.    The publisher set the price way too high for such a short e-book, but decent humor books are hard to come by, so I made an exception. In retrospect I probably should have just bought 30 Rock on DVD.    Also, am I the only one who didn't know she had a scar all this time?  Tina - I'm not trying to be amazing at you, but I think its pretty bad-ass.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I waited a long time for this DVD to be released. I even pre-ordered. Unfortunately, the quality of the disc I received leaves much to be desired. The quality is so dark I have to completely blacken the room (never watch during the day) in order to make out what is on screen. The first time I watched it, I found myself having to remember snatches from the book in order to know what was going on on screen. The video was so dark I could hear voices, but not make out the action.    I may have to re-purchase from some other source.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I agree with previous reviewers - this book and the next two in the series were totally engrossing. I just could not put these down until I'd completed every one of them.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I can't find the rio up update. I couldn't find a refresh apps in the menu as suggested. Ugh, frustrating.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It's hard to believe that I am so critical of someone that I used to have so much respect for as a kid. George Lucas had a major impact on my life and for that I am forever grateful. Unfortunately there was only so much I could take over the years until I felt I had to separate myself from his ways. In some ways it's because of Star Wars that grew to be able to trust my instincts and feelings. Sadly, George Lucas has become such a manipulative control freak over the years and the worst part is that he seems to believe every thing he says with little or no accountability. NOT releasing the \\"original\\" unaltered films (IV through VI) on Blu-ray is an insult to Star Wars fans every where, George Lucas simply does not get it as we have already been through this with him before.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Upgraded from an old Forerunner 201 after many years of training with it.  The GPS technology has certainly improved, quick linking times, no hunting for signals.  The ANT+ transfer system is really nice.  Sometimes it gets hung up but I would still give it a 4 of 5.  The bezel can be a pain at times, but if set up properly (auto scroll), you don't really need to touch the watch while training.  The device has frozen on me twice but by pressing and holding the Lap/Start button, it reboots.<br /><br />I have logged about 3500 miles on the 405CX and can say it's a stable, excellent training tool.  Would highly recommend.
B004SGWYVA|4.0|At first I was a bit hesitant to watch the series, thinking it was another melodramatic series featuring a post-apocalyptic nightmare world populated by emo kids struggling against inner demons and their own insecurity.  The first episode annihilates any such stereotype.  These students mean business and they aren't afraid to dish it out, even to zombies who used to be their friends and loved ones.<br />Based soley on the story its a strong series, it capitalizes a bit on the \\"Resident Evil\\" syndrome, but puts enough of a twist on it that you really don't see a comparison.  The characters are all very well defined, though they ocassionally cross traditional anime stereotypes (the geeky Otaku, the buxom school nurse, the proud and intelligent school president, the flashy bad boy, and even the katana wielding shrine priestess in training) they do so in a way that makes them endearing and not annoying.<br />There is enough action to make the series intense, but most of the action is about the survival aspect and how to cope with the loss of thier world.  While structured somewhat like a \\"harem series\\" there isn't alot of overt romance involved.  The ocassional \\"fan service\\" is great, but conveniently placed towels and steam prevent the series from getting too racy (but the jiggling continues!).  Personally I didn't mind the censoring, in most cases I think its just silly to censor it and I wouldn't mind seeing an uncensored version down the line (fingers crossed) but it's no big deal.<br />The series just seems to be starting to come together when the 12th Episode rolls in and leaves you wondering.  This is definitely one I will be following closely, hopefully the recent events in Japan will not prevent them from publishing more of this great series!

0811870413|5.0|If you bake bread at home, this is a must-have book. My first try was a success - best homemade bread I have ever tasted. Maybe even the best bread period. The 23 pages of directions are a bit daunting, but if you take the time to sit down and make your own notes, it becomes easy to follow and intuitive. Be warned, though, that you will find yourself buying the recommended Lodge combo cooker, long oven gloves, and several different flours. Undoubtedly you will also want to get some appropriately sized bannetons and liners, so this is not a low-budget undertaking. But the bread is defintiely worth it. Great gift, too. I bought the book for both of my daughters; my daughter--in-law already had a copy. My neighbor ran out and bought a copy after I gave him one of the loaves I had baked. Beautiful illustrations, clear directions, and even some thoughtful prose thrown in.
1400031001|5.0|The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart 1906-1991 is an intermittent diary of the life of a writer and journalist, written in many different parts of the world and covering a multitude of world events. Cleverly interwoven meetings with famous people - including Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, Picasso, Martha Gellhorn and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, with editor's footnotes, make it difficult to realise that this is the story of an entirely fictional person. We learn no more about the Duke and Duchess than we already know - however, nobody can re-write history.   Mountstuart has a huge sexual appetite, is amoral in most relationships although, after spending many months incarcerated towards the end of the war, the loss of his second wife and child causes him unimaginable anguish. The story also deals with a writer's loneliness, with his ultimate realisation that love is more life-defining than sex.     This is an entertaining, sometimes comical, book, with an inevitable sadness as we see his descent to extreme penury before being rescued by a legacy. William Boyd's writing ensures that the reader is really interested in the trivia of the everyday life of an unknown man, although certainly the singularity of that life made the story more remarkable than mine or yours would have been.     Maybe his second wife was rather conveniently removed from the scene; perhaps his flight from the results of a fling with an underage girl in New York to Nigeria was a ploy to enable Boyd to write about areas of the world with which he was familiar; but it is done with inimitable style.     It was a fascinating read, I was sorry it had to come to an end and that I had to say good-bye to an entertaining, humanly flawed character, one who became more sympathetic and kinder to others in own misfortune. Reading groups would enjoy the many aspects of this book and I guarantee that it would provoke lively discussion.

B001UV4XHY|3.0|I really enjoyed this Dark episode of this amazing series- my only constructive criticism is that the Movies disc seemed to be over compressed -and the disc its stored on cannot handle it well - would of been better to divide the movie and print it on two disc's - not a clean copy- very disapointed in the disc manufacturer .i do not own a blue ray player and am waiting for their prices to come down and work better , wish i could of gotten a blueray copy -would of been better -maybe ? ( not every bluray player will play all DVD. disc's - reguardles of what they say ) overall- good movie/Bad copy

1594744769|4.0|MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN, by Ransom Riggs was a fun and interesting read. I enjoyed Riggs' writing style and thought that the character development of the main character and his grandfather were both well done. Many of the other characters had less depth, but were still interesting to read about, especially the Peculiars. I had doubts about the included pictures prior to reading, but for me at least, they fit well into the story.<br /><br />Jacob is fifteen years old when the book opens, and more like his grandfather than he knows, both in ability and in character. The book starts by delving into Jacob's relationship with his grandfather, Abraham Portman. As a child, Jacob believes Abe's stories wholeheartedly. But the act of aging and mockery from peers quickly ends those beliefs, and strains their relationship. And then a monster only Jacob can see slaughters Abe, setting Jacob on a path to discovering all of his grandfather's secrets. Along with the unsettling truth that everything he's been told as a child... was true.<br /><br />Somehow, I found the Peculiars (the orphaned children Miss Peregrine cares for) to be creepier than wights or hollowgasts. At least, they were until they walked onstage. Then they were still interesting, but not quite as fun. This could have been my reading atmosphere -- it was stormy and I was alone in the house, surrounded by shadows. And the pictures were excellent in aiding spookiness. But then I read the second half at work in broad daylight with customers milling around. So the wights and the hollowgast just didn't evoke much emotion from me.<br /><br />The ending felt rushed. It certainly left the door open to a sequel. But for me, the driving force of the book was answered: Jacob learned the truth about his grandfather and who the peculiar children were. The story could end here and I still feel it works. Not a perfect work by any means but solid enough. And I fully intend to read the next novel Ransom Riggs writes, whether it's a sequel or something entirely new.quel or something entirely new.
B004QYZATW|1.0|OMG what a horrible movie. I'm a Johnny Depp fan so much so that i tried watching a movie with Angelina Jolie. It was a bad decision. The plot was ridiculous (even for a blockbuster), and the performances were totally unconvincing. I think the best part of the movie is the way it was shot and the beautiful setting. Aside from that, it's just not worth the time.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This wasn't always the easiest read with lots of charaters and facts thrown in at once and a little jumping around, but it was well worth it.    Every American should stop and read this account BEFORE they form an opinion on the USA's military's actions.  While this book didn't change my mind about anything, it did give me a better perspective.  Thanks for sharing your story!

B004F5GKUA|5.0|A truly epic Smallville tale. The mirror box returns with a parallel universe inside. Plenty of twists, turns and revelations about the Luthor family. One of favorite episodes of all times. The ending gave me goosebumps, Fantastic!
B0014DBZT2|5.0|I don't think Cave and the Bad Seeds can top this. but then I didn't think he could top his last double album. This album is psychological, literary and biblical and sounds great. There some very good reviews here on Amazon and I can't add anything new.<br /><br />If you know Cave's music you better own this.
0425166805|5.0|This is not Von Daniken's best book, but I rate it 5 stars because it was his first, and it is a classic must-read introductory book to his theories. Although this is somewhat dated now, it still is every bit as relevant. The ideas presented in here are groundbreaking and truly are worth reading, if you dare. Realistically, people can see whatever they want, but logical people will all see the same thing, and they will see it Von Daniken's way.<br /><br />You will have to shed years of psychological brainwashing and emotional entrenchment to truly free yourself, this book is the first step into a greater world.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|I was very pleased with these items. They are quality and lets face it cute. My now 17 year old grand son had a pair of these high contrast toys when he was a baby and it was a favorite. We all got a kick out of watching him discover his hands and feet. So I bought this updated version for a niece's baby and it was a big hit!

B002IVLH60|4.0|I have been listening to this CD nonstop since I got it. It's a great mix of fast-paced rock out  songs, storytelling songs, and softer, heartfelt ballads. Pearl Jam really reaffirmed their rock legend status, relevance and plain old charm with this CD. It makes me proud to have been a fan of theirs ever since TEN. I literally grew up on their music, and they still know how to get me jumping to the beat.
0756404738|3.0|I loved Name of the Wind. Wise Man's Fear was entertaining, but had long stretches of soap opera.     I was craving more when I finished Name of the Wind and spent days on the author's blog trying to find out when his next book was going to be released. Finishing this book was completely different. I was glad that it was over. I hope the third book gets back on track.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|Now that The Black Swan has become available on video, I rented it from Netflix and watched it last night. I have to admit that it wasn't at all what I expected, having seen several dance and ballet films throughout the years. Although I can't say that I would highly recommend seeing it, especially for young impressionable minds, I do feel it is worth thinking about the ideas it puts forth. The theme of good and evil permeates the story, as Natalie Portman struggles to dance the role of both the White Swan and the Black Swan. The White Swan, representing her purity and grace, as opposed to the Black Swan, which in this case represents her dark or shadow side. The choreographer who chooses her to dance the lead role, places her under constant pressure to get in touch with her dark side. He seduces her and bullies her into learning the part, all the while telling her that it is for her own success as a dancer. Some of her peer dancers play along and exhibit qualities far from their graceful appearance as ballerinas. The idea of cut throat competition, throughout the film, distracts us from the gift of this beautiful art form.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is seemingly surrounded by evil as she struggles to maintain her balance both literally and figuratively. The pressures put on her by not only her dancing associates but by her own Mother, makes us wonder how she has ever survived this long. Her anxiety and self mutilation is her way of releasing the pressure she is under, while trying to do what she is most happy doing in life, which is to dance.<br /><br />After surviving several encounters with her selfish competitors, that lead her to compromise her own personal integrity, she finds the courage to chose herself over losing herself and dances the role perfectly. However, her seeming accomplishment is not without a steep price and loss, especially that of her graceful innocence.<br /><br />The film made me question the whole concept of sacrificing one's own integrity for the sake of one's art form. It brings to mind several famous art personalities, who have compromised their own integrity, only to pay the price with the loss of their own soul and life.<br /><br />For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? Mark: 35art form. It brings to mind several famous art personalities, who have compromised their own integrity, only to pay the price with the loss of their own soul and life.

031603441X|4.0|A very entertaining and informative tale.  If you're a Rolling Stones fan, it's fantastic, and even if you're not, it's still very good.  Very impressive after all the dope that he remembers innumerable things about his childhood and early years.  Though I'm not a musician, his details on how he tuned his guitar to get his very unique and unmistakable sound, how he and Charlie Watts were in a groove on rhythm, and how he and Mick Jagger on occasion pumped out an entire album in a week are all truly fascinating.  It's also interesting how many hit songs the two of them wrote that they gave to other artists - country, pop, soul - that the Stones never did themselves.  The first hundred pages are tedious, but by the time he forms the band with Mick Jagger and Brian Jones, the book takes on it's own quick pace with great detail.   You truly feel like you're with him on the journey.  In a weird sort of way, it's similar in style to William F. Buckley's sailing biographies (e.g.  \\"Atlantic High\\", \\"Airborn\\"), and with the short insights from friends and relatives embedded in the book, it comes alive.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Blade Runner.A key picture of the 80's.A film that became a classic of its own.A film that defined science fiction in a new way.After all this year this movie never aged.First if you wanna explore Blade Runner again do it with the Blue Ray.The remastering is unbelievable beyond every imagination.Every grain, every pixel and most of all the sound hits you right away.From the first sound attack through Vangelis' classic score you can dive into the picture.The extras are numerous you have to take some days to put you through all the specials.But ecspecially the Five Cuts make you jump skyhigh.<br />For me this is a must own on ray and the perfect start to start your collection
0756405890|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I expected a bit more action than was given in this first book...it's not going to be anything like a Sword of Truth book where there is a ton of action/fighting.  But this book is very well written and I really enjoyed following a young Kvothe through all he had to deal with before even turning 16.  Even without much action the book holds you and it was hard to put down, it was just that easy and fun to read.  It did a pretty good job of setting up the next book also and I'm guessing that we'll get into more of the action/magic/fighting/bad guys in these last 2 books.    Very enjoyable and wouldn't have any problems recommending it.
0394818237|5.0|Okay, some of this might be a bit dated (we no longer run to the neighborhood fire bell and pull it to alert firemen to come put out a fire), but it's charming and full of rich visual detail, and you can read the text or just talk about the pictures. It's also nice because you don't have to read it cover to cover, but can choose 2 or 3 stories for younger audiences. I love Richard Scarry's writing style - it's simple and a little quirky. We also like to look for Lowly Worm (my son calls him Lonely Worm). We like this book so much we give it to others as a gift.
B000006NXP|4.0|Reader, be warned: the engineers of this noble endeavour shanked proceedings and the Original Image Bit Processing can only do so much to mitigate the disaster. Sonically speaking, it is almost unlistenable unless one has a taste for the macabre. Shrillness is the least of its problems. For instance, it is so top heavy - where in the hell are the cellists and the double bassists - that the good ship SS Vienna Philharmonic is in danger of capsizing at any given moment. There is no underlying stability or predictability to the aural experience; much like an asteroid belt, big 'chunks' of orchestral sound come into focus and then fade way with no residue whatsoever. Welcome to Bizarro.<br /><br />To the interpretation itself. My view has always been that the conception is better than the execution, but, as per above, the imbalance could be attributed elsewhere. Kleiber's interpretation is first class - indisputably - but is it best of class? Leaving aside comparisons with Herbie - (the 64, 77 or the stupendous live performance from September 1968 [Natise Sound, Hvk 104 - wow]), for all the ferocity and dramatic bite that Kleiber brings to proceedings, the shy maestro is too metronomic compared with the Master [[ASIN:B000006HR6 Brahms: Symphony No. 4; Haydn Variations / Furtw&auml;ngler]]. Conscious that other careers beckoned if they did not perform to their utmost (say, scouting the Tractor Factory at Stalingrad), Willy's sound-engineers defied the limitations of their technology to capture the greatest rendition ever of the Fourth. If you can track it down, it is a better investment than the Kleiber. You'll thank me later, insofar as you can find voice afterwards!
0670022411|5.0|I won't go into too much--there are plenty of other reviewers on here who can articulate their thoughts better than I can. But I will say that this is definitely a wonderfully crafted story with interesting characters that leaves you wanting more. I can't wait for the next!!
B0041T4ML4|4.0|I wish I could give 4.5 stars.  The only real issue with the book is the start is a little slow, but once it gets going it definitely hooks you.  The only superficial issue is that the point of view character changes from chapter to chapter and each chapter ends right as it really gets interesting.  Definitely kept me up after my bed time as I just had to start the next chapter.<br /><br />He does a great job of making the science part of the background and not so much the foreground focus of the story.  A great science fiction story that pushes us to think a little bit into the future and consider a possible consequence of our messing with genetics and the environment.  It is not preachy, just good science fiction that asks \\"What if ....\\"

1577311523|5.0|This is not an in depth review, I actually listened to the audio book instead of reading the book.  I do have both though. I have many self help/spiritual books in my library but I truly feel this book changed my life and his message is quite important, so I decided to write my first amazon review.  The main concept in his teaching IS very simple, but can be explored from every angle and every rebuttal, thus a modern glance needs to be taken and a book was created.    This book changed my personal perspective, my family life, my spiritual life, the way i greet people, the way i build relationships, helped me see subtle addictions more clearly, the addictions of others, how to keep my space respectfully, and as I began to change my patterns I could easily see the people around me changing.  I'd say thats worth the 5 to 10 bucks    After going through half the book I wanted to see how he looks in person so I checked youtube and i feel he is a great representation of the message he's putting across.  youtube has his basic message for free if you need a glimpse before buying.  Will this book explain the universe and give you everything you need to become superman? probably not, but that wasnt the point. its simply another step in a journey, just as important as any other.  its an exciting planet to be on, stay real my friends
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've tried a few other calendar apps but this is the best so far. It has a few features I haven't seen before but really wanted, like the option to set the default amount of time for a reminder before an event, or to remove it completely, which is great for me since I never use reminders and removing them each time I made an event on other calendar apps was annoying. Anyway this app's real easy to use, clean and very fast and I'd recommend it.

1594744769|4.0|This book was a definite surprise. It reads like a Sherman Alexie novel with its snarky narration, but also as an homage to Peter Pan and the film Nightbreed. Author Ransom Riggs has produced a fantastical tale of \\"strange\\" children, time travel, mystery, horror, and a boy's coming of age. The photos are an added bonus as they allow the reader in to this world.<br /><br />Jacob Portman's loved his grandfather's stories of an island of monsters and children with powers since he was a child. He outgrew these stories, and while eking out a living at his family's line of drug stores, his beloved grandfather is killed. Police say wild dogs, but in truth it's one of the creatures his grandpa talked about. So it comes down to this: how much of those stories was real? After sessions with a therapist, Jacob realizes the answers he's looking for are on the island his grandfather spoke of, where children can lift boulders over their heads and hover in the air, schooled and protected by a powerful headmistress. But what happens when the world outside comes in?<br /><br />MISS PEREGRINE'S is a wonderful addition to the YA fantasy genre. There's a non-traditional love triangle. There's no teenage angst. This is a pack-your-bags-and-go-on-an- adventure read. One can just sink into Jacob's thoughts: his humor, grief, joy. I especially liked his relationship with his grandpa. It was so genuine that when his grandpa dies it strikes a chord. It was a little awkward for him to start developing feelings for a certain girl at the school.<br /><br />Mr. Riggs does a fine job crafting the children. They felt real; energetic, fun loving, and full of surprises. The adults are not as genuine- they're made in a few different ways: aloof, self-interested.<br /><br />The backdrop of World World II and the photography weave through Jacob's growing up from privileged boy to a young man who's more sure of his family and where he belongs is satisfying.<br /><br />Some of the passages lose their strength because they are told as opposed to shown. Show Jacob's frustrations when he's trying to come to terms with his grandpa's death. Show his sorrow.<br /><br />Scary moments are pretty scary (at least I thought so). There is cursing and adult content. The ending eludes to a sequel. Still, a fine read. If you're up for a trip with some peculiar children, this is highly recommended.to shown.

0375507256|5.0|Amazingly creative and well written. Lots of surprises with the different historical fiction pieces woven together with science fiction. Very unique story, nothing like I have ever read.
0375831002|5.0|I love to read and I couldn't put this book down. Told from Death's POV, it was absolutely amazing. The character development and story line are strong throughout. But beware that the end might need some Kleenex.

1569757275|4.0|I bought this since it would be a more interesting way to learn Chinese and I already have regular Chinese learning books. The topics are fun to learn but it mixed up Chinese way and Taiwanese way to say something sometimes (like American English and British English), but still good to learn tho.

I love the fact that this DVD new on amazon was cheaper then at the store and I got free shipping! :) It was packaged nicely and arrived I believe a day or to before expected! I was very satisfied with the whole process definitely will order again! :)
B000005RFQ|4.0|Worth getting for \\"Zero the Hero\\" and the title track alone, and as the great Ian Gillan's last great performance as a metal screamer (his metal voice is shot on the subsequent Purple reunion albums, but I still love him). Popular in it's day, much maligned since (due I think mostly to an ugly tour and the resulting disparaging comments from the band members. Gillan himself said he threw up when he heard the mix and saw the cover art). I tell ya, this is a great metal album. None of the over-production that killed off just about every Sabbath album since, Gillan and Iommi in top form, memorable tracks. The only filler is really the dull last track. For fans of classic Sabbath and Purple, I don't see how you can go wrong here.
0307389839|5.0|Shipped well-no problems.  I like the writing style of the author almost journal style. Very good insight into the process of training and in the daily run in general.
140003180X|2.0|Although Alexander McCall has an easy to read style that flows without requiring any intellectual effort, his books sound too much alike. Soon the charm becomes boredom  and one desires to get to the end, not because of interest in the plot but just because one refuses to believe that it won't get better at some point.<br />The Kalahari Typing School for Men is one of those stories that teases you with what one expects to develop into an interesting mystery but ends in a simplistic way.<br />Definitely this is a case that proves that sequels are seldom better than the original.
B001O1O71C|4.0|This is an interesting read from the perspective of a 9-year-old boy. For those who state that the story is just a narrative with no analysis or understanding of the Out-With situation by Bruno, my thought is that is precisely what MAKES this a good read. From my own experience with my son, this story hits about the right note for that age. It is very believeable that Bruno can't remember the names of his 'best' friends a year after leaving Berlin... most 9-year-old boys live in the here & now and don't reflect deeply on the past. It is also completely believeable that neither Bruno nor his sister really understand what is going on across the fence. There was no Internet, CNN, or Facebook to expose the reality. Obviously Grandmother did not support her son's choice of career, and she made it known in a way that only a mother can do. Mr. Boyle's depiction of the family dynamics seems credible for time period.     I recommend this book, if only to get a differing perspective. Its simple ending is haunting and powerful, and likely will stay with you.    Read it!
0385342039|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is my favorite so I am already to read the next adventure she takes her readers on.     Sophie does not let you down with Twenties girls if you love Sophie you will love this book, the book is really cute and funny
B00475AYJQ|2.0|When I began the first novel in the Kingkiller Chronicles I wasn't able to put it down.  I loved it.  When I finished it I immediately downloaded this book and started reading right away.      We're in book two here and an overall theme to the story has yet to take shape.  It feels like the book is almost a series of unrelated accidents and it ends without any real progress being made.    Obviously fantasy novels require some suspension of disbelief but I found several scenes in this book to be utterly absurd.  I have read a lot of fantasy in the past and this book is the first one where I have ever found myself thinking \\"That would never happen!!\\".    Several scenes in the last half of the book served little or no purpose.  For some reason the author decided to elaborate on these scenes in endless detail.  Other scenes that seem more interesting are rushed or glossed over completely.    This series is not finished.  Mr. Rothfuss may have an amazing ending to this series that will tie up all the loose ends and satisfy all of the fans of the first novel, but the next book is likely a few years out.  Right now I recommend avoiding the series.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|I'm a new Fanpire but I love the music on these soundtracks. They definitely help make the movies. Eclipse is not my favorite soundtrack but it's good. Worth listening to.
B001SS3JS8|5.0|I enjoyed readying this book, but found it very emotionally draining. I cried for the entire second half of the book! Picoult is a fantastic writer and has a knack for getting inside her characters emotions and thoughts. I would definitely recommend this book.
B0018OASZE|4.0|Over-all 3 star for album plus 1 for the vinyl. The vinyl was excellent quality. Very pleased. Actually better quality than the 3-album Judas Priest Nostradamus concept work recently purchased. The first listen of this debut was very good with 3 4 star songs. After a few more listens that may go up or down, but over-all very good. The but... When purchased, just days ago (May 2011), there was a blurb that a digital download was also available with the purchase of the vinyl. However, when the coupon was received with the album, it showed the offer was expired... June 2009. Would still buy the vinyl, but was disappointed the offer was made and not available.  Bought 21 at the same time... will rate that later. 21 is off to a good start however...
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Takashi Murakami's book Superflat presents us with deep social commentary in the guise of a discussion of the sources of current trends in anime and manga in historical Japanese art.     And what might that have to do with this movie you may ask? Because more than anything else Summer Wars is the same social commentary brought to life in anime form. It looks at the conflict Japan, and the rest of the world, faces when tradition and modern technologies and trends collide. This is made visually evident in a family, portrayed in a style that deliberately gives a the flavor of Miyazaki to things going on the the real world, while the virtual world is as deliberately Murakami in its flavor.    This sets the stage for not only a battle of visual styles, but a battle of all flavors of new and old, pitting electronic networking against old fashioned connecting in person and by phone, video games against baseball, programming against pen and paper, and in the end a contest of two wills, electronic versus human.    As such it is not only a marvel to watch, but is also an incredibly revealing and very intentional piece of social commentary where the metaphorical death of the traditional makes it clear to those affected not only how important those traditions truly are but how they must adapted by the next generation to face a new world.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I purchased Twilight Soundtrack in '08 in anticipation for the first film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's book series.  I enjoyed this product more than I enjoyed the film adaptation.  The packaging of this product had been awful and the case had been broken!  I'd been traveling a lot after I had received it so I forgot to return it.  The product itself is what I expected -- nothing more, nothing less.
B00417HV14|5.0|The Bonamassa live performance at Royal Albert Hall is very entertaining and very well presented.  Joe is one of my favorite blues performers.    The concert was done in a good amount of time and it was great to see Eric Clapton join Joe.  His choice of songs was excellent.  I plan to watch this DVD more and introduce it to my friends who like blues as well.
B0043X1FOK|5.0|Everyone involved in making this movie should be proud. It excels the prequel in humor, depth and intelligence. My favorite movie quotes of all time come from this script \\"with friends like these, who needs......?\\" and the scene where Johnny five is coaching his buddy in a date, and the cat jumps on his antennae is my idea of comedy at its funniest, cleanest, and best. Call me eccentric, but Aristophanes and Shakespeare would have been proud to have created this. Enjoyable by kids and adults, this is a movie with a very great and good heart.
1439153663|4.0|The prologue opens on a lynching with a description, but not the name of the victim.  The question of how the story will end in death kept my attention throughout the book.  The characters are in some ways very familiar, but there is enough originality in their personal quirks to keeps them interesting.  Even though there is a great deal of violence against slaves, women, and children in this book, it is integral to character and plot development, and therefore doesn't feel gratuitous.  This is a well told story.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|love this game but I have a Droid 2 and I tried to download the update and its giving me problems. How can this be fixed? I'm going thru Angry Birds withdrawl! It just keeps saying that the update could not be installed.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Not much to say. It simply fails at doing its main function, which is to download YouTube videos. For the most part, it can download MP3s fine, but many videos I tell it to download simply don't. There's no error message, no warning, nothing happens. At least an error message would be nice so I can tell why it's failing.
0446672653|5.0|Dr. Weiss' tale of soulmates reunited does a wonderful job of weaving a tragic and beautiful story originating in past lifetimes, and linking it to the reality of modern day life.    This is one of the books that I recommend that *all* of my Soulmate DNA clients read.     Truly, this book helps each of us understand how soulmate bonds are formed and how traces of the past might manifest as clues in our lives today. It gives those seeking love hope that they *will* be reunited with someone they knew before, and that they don't (necessarily!) have to sacrifice themselves to years of stressful pursuit in order to find love.    If you're curious about the magic of love, the mystery of reincarnation and what draws us to others, you can't go wrong spending a few enjoyable hours with this book.    While the past life stories and timing around meeting our soulmates may be different for all of us, Only Love is Real fills us with hope and knowing... that if we keep searching and keep growing, that our paths will inevitably find not just one, but many soulmates we've known before.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|There is no question that this story works:  a rat who doesn't quite fit in must make his own way, so he tries to do what he really loves, i.e. gourmet cooking.  The rat stumbles onto a situation, where a bumbling man boy (also someone who doesn't fit in) is trying to get work in a restaurant, and helps him to appear as if he were a chef of genius.  Once the boy understands the rat's talent, it makes for some pretty funny role playing to keep the secret.  The man boy meets a girl, begins to make his fortune, etc.  Then, there is an imbroglio, including a dustup with a vindictive resto critic, throwing everything into jeopardy.  This is pretty formulaic stuff and the happy ending is predictable.<br /><br />That being said, the film does do a great job regarding the themes of conformity, surprising talents, and the need to throw away one's prejudices.  It is very well done, and amidst the antics my son was moved by it, too.  Recommended, though given Disney's pricing policies, we probably won't buy it.
0425241505|5.0|I debated between 4 and 5 stars, but it ended so well I just had to bump it up to 5-stars. It was a really enjoyable steamy PNR story that never had a dull moment. Loved the H/h, the world building was solid, the humor was wicked fun, the steam hot, and the side characters were all well done too. My only small issue were the rapid mood swings between the H/h toward the end. While they were understandable and sometimes even made me laugh, it was jarring in other places. I look forward to reading the next in this series. Highly recommend to PNR fans.
1442337966|5.0|I listen to this series as I drive.  It is a wonderful way to establish a connection with Spirit and to achieve what you want.  Wishing to sell my house and relocate in a sad econony, I put these principles to work.  I now live in a new home where I wished.  It is helpful with relationships, money, love, and life.    My recommendation is.............do not wait..get it.
0345522478|3.0|I'm pretty picky because I'm an author, editor, and publisher, but I do have to say I enjoyed this book despite some of the problems that glared at me.  The action and pacing are good. The story was interesting enough for me to finish reading.  That being said, there were plenty of novice issues that any good editor should've picked up on.<br /><br />I liked Atticus, the main character, but I really couldn't find any other characters to like except Oberon, his dog, and the widow he does work for.  Beyond that, the characters came off flat.  Werewolves and Vampires are pretty passe, but still can be pulled off if the characters are interesting and memorable.  The gods were two dimensional, and while I can forgive that with the ancillary gods, the villain, Aenghus Og, was about as two dimensional as Snidely Whiplash.  We hear how bad-ass he is but we never see him until the big showdown.<br /><br />This author pulls a rookie mistake with an info-dump in the beginning of the book, couched that the protagonist is talking to a goddess.  I kept hearing \\"As you know, Bob...\\" in my mind.  I hate info-dumps, so that is a pet peeve.<br /><br />Another big complaint is who this book is being marketed to?  The cover suggests it should be chick lit, but it clearly isn't.  (I'm not a big paranormal chick lit type of person anyway).  This is urban fantasy and should be marketed as such.<br /><br />Even with all this to complain about, I still enjoyed the book.  I'm somewhat curious as to the next books, but I haven't decided if I'm curious enough to pay the money to read him.  Still, it's entertaining and worth a look-see.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This was an INCREDIBLE purchase and well worth the price, I would have paid more for it, but I am glad I didn't have too. I loved being able to pre-order it and have it come to my doorstep so I didn't have to worry about getting to the local stores before they sold out! Only had to wait a couple days for it after the release date in stores, and this was only because I wanted the free shipping so I didn't pay extra for it to get here the same day it came out. :)
B003UESJH4|5.0|I have only a handful of movies that are in my \\"keeper\\" collection.  This movie is one that I have added to that prized collection.  If you like well made movies with unique prospective on real life historical events, then you will love this movie.  It give you the inside on the royal family of Brittan. It is very interesting to see the future queen Elizabeth as a little girl and her queen mother.  Just a wonderful film about the speech struggles of Elizabeth's father during a critical time in world history.  Add this film to your own \\"keeper\\" collection.
B004APVI1G|5.0|has a good 3D content, not as much as movies like YOGI BEAR 3D or Alice in Wonderland but acceptable within the 3D range
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Wasting Light is a very good album by the Foo Fighters. The opening two tracks are fast tempo and will really get your blood flowing. An excellent all around album.
B004K4IZ54|1.0|As the product itself highlights the 3D format, I will refer only to comment on this issue, as the film itself is very good and the soundtrack is the best.    3D content: 3D is the least I've seen ... the truth see the 3D version will detract from the film, the 3D effects are negligible, I think where else to note is when the world of the grid, the camera takes very mint shots from the floor and it looks a little depth of perspective. The truth does not recommend for anything buy the 3D format, but I do recommend the 2D Bluray format is great.    To comment on this, I reproduced the 3D content in a 50-inch 3D TV and 3D projector on a scale of 120 inches.

B00005JPKE|5.0|War is hell,of hat there is no doubt.We tend to malign our enemies maliciously during times of crisis/war.In this instance the Japanese were portrayed as small,bespectacled dirty fighters often referred to as Nips or Japs.The truth was the Japanese were indeed hard soldiers to contend with on the battlefield,stopping at very little to win the tiniest piece of ground,even to the extent of banzai or suicide charges(on the ground-kamikazes in the air).But to propagandize the public and sheer up support for the war machine(very necessary in times such as WW2)these kind of images helped to propel the US and the rest of the allies ever onward to ultimate victory.<br />Underneath the Japanese soldier lay....a human being like anyone else.Their Samurai code and service and discipline structures gave them an attitude which took the Western powers a while to get a handle on.When they finally did they took the fighting to the Japanese in their own style.30,40 years ago,this movie would not have stood much of a chance of getting noticed or being accepted altogether.Memories of those that fought against them were still very much tender.Even today it is still tough for those that fought in such hell holes as Iwo Jima,to accept another or different side to that piece of battlefield history.It was a bold step on Eastwood's part to undertake its making,but undertake it he did and to much acclaim.<br />Letters from Iwo Jima(released in Dec/06) was the second release which dealt with that terrible battle.His first epic was Flags of our Fathers(told from the U.S. perspective),but personally I find this one much more compelling than the first.The story in \\"Letters\\" dealt with the small(in comparison)Japanese garrison ordered to hold the island at all costs.We see the day to day life amongst the troops and their struggle to survive on little hope,meager rations and a strict and unbending command structure.In fact what makes this movie work so well is the pall of the little hope this garrison has against the superior forces of the Americans.It is truly a miracle they accomplished and held out as much they did,as long as they did.We see the human but tragic side of the Japanese,a side we the Japanese antagonists have more often than not,just refused to see.Again it is a rational thought process as we,especially the soldiers themselves,would like to try and forget all the horrors that battle,as so many others of WW2,bring to mind.Many others would also say they got as good as good as they gave.Of that I cannot argue.<br />This movie stirs up those and a plethora of other emotions as you watch it,but Eastwood's camera doesn't dwell on any one thing too long.The movie does not take a side,it projects what it was like to be a Japanese soldier during the battle for Iwo Jima,and nothing more.Eastwood,remarkably and successfully,juggles a very controversial topic masterfully.If it had been handled any other way it would have been a disaster.<br />This two disc edition has been transferred beautifully and is clear and crisp in its original widescreen a/r.Extras are abundant and include:A featurette on the making of the movie,a look at the cast members and a clip from the 2006 premiere and press conference in Japan for the movie.<br />A highly recommended DVD for war buffs out there and for everyone else looking for good plain entertainment.The movie takes no sides and Eastwood and company gives a surprisingly accurate portrayal of the life of the Japanese soldier during one of the most bloodiest battles of the Pacific during WW2.against the superior forces of the Americans.It is truly a miracle they accomplished and held out as much they did,as long as they did.We see the human but tragic side of the Japanese,a side we the Japanese antagonists have more often than not,just refused to see.Again it is a rational thought process as we,especially the soldiers themselves,would like to try and forget all the horrors that battle,as so many others of WW2,bring to mind.Many others would also say they got as good as good as they gave.Of that I cannot argue.

B0026EWZMY|4.0|AHM was a true original which broke all the rules and represents Floyd at their quirkiest and most inventive. It's possibly Floyd's most enduring pre-DSOTM collection with a character all its own.<br /><br />The original vinyl album had a similar structure to its follow-on, `Meddle:' one side devoted to a long symphonic concept moving seamlessly through several sections (i.e. `Echoes' on `Meddle'), and the other side a collection of songs which stand well in their own right.<br /><br />The 24-minute symphonic title track owes a great deal to Kent-based avant-garde composer Ron Geesin, who at the request of Roger Waters conceived and arranged all the brass, orchestral and choral parts at the centre of the piece. Waters and Mason underpin the main theme with a slow-tempo rhythm over which Geesin's brass section lays its cowboy-western theme. The piece then moves seamlessly through several movements including a truly sublime choral section and a short funky jam from the band to return, symphonic style, to the main theme in conclusion. The whole works better than it should, and is all the more remarkable for its time in having virtually no lyrics (the choir is simply used as an instrument for sound). The result is a unique listening experience and in a way beautiful, with fine contributions from Wright and Gilmour, demonstrating here for the first time he was by now a vital member of the band with a great and maturing creative talent. A comparison with `Echoes' recorded only months later is instructive in demonstrating the evolution of ideas which led to some of Floyd's greatest musical innovations in the 1970s, when the band functioned as a productive unit working together.<br /><br />Side 2 of the vinyl album kicks off with Roger Waters' `If', an acoustic guitar piece somewhat reminiscent of `Grantchester Meadows' in musical form but with the more sinister theme of potential looming mental instability: an early indication of the direction which finally came to maturity in the underlying thematic preoccupations of DSOTM. Dave Gilmour lays over some sublime electric guitar to beef-out the final section of the song.<br /><br />Rick Wright's `Summer of 68' is possibly the best thing he ever wrote. It continues the laid-back mood with a jaunty upbeat rhythm overlaid with a fine melody supporting poignant lyrical musings about the lack of depth and meaning in an opportunistic one-night stand with a `groupie' whilst on tour: \\"I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all...tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you...just tell me, how do you feel?\\" The final section fills out with a blast of brass over the rhythm to echo the style of the symphonic title track.<br /><br />Dave Gilmour's `Fat Old Sun' is a slow, lazy and richly-textured song and classic Floyd, again picking up towards the end with electric guitar over Waters' and Mason's slow insistent rhythm section. Nice.<br /><br />The closer `Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast' has been described by members of the band in later years as `absolute rubbish.' This is too harsh: it's interesting and different, and at the time of first release caused much amusement in the listening audience (I know - I was there). It's a studio piece in three musical sections, formed around short episodes voiced by Alan (one of Floyd's road crew) as he prepares his breakfast complete with sound effects, following a night of - we can only imagine - some psychedelic mind excursion courtesy of exotic chemical substances. It's a somewhat downbeat closer and interesting in its historic context in that it illustrates the experimental and think-out-of-the-box mind set of Floyd at the time, before they settled on projects of themed songwriting which led to the greater commercial success of the DSOTM and WYWH period.<br /><br />AHM is a fine album and still, after 40 years, eminently listenable with some great music. It has a more mellow feel than some of Floyd's other offerings and hard-driving rock numbersare absent, but it's none the worst for that and is, at heart, quality stuff.<br /><br />The album's title was, reportedly, taken from a newspaper headline about a woman being fitted with a new kind of hi-tech pacemaker, spontaneously chosen by Roger Waters and with no direct relevance to the content of the music.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This second season was even better than the first and being able to watch all 13 episodes on Netflix and without commercial interruptions is a sheer delight.  This action packed series aims to please.  The story line continues and certainly packs a mean wallop.<br /><br />The season starts with an incredible act of violence against Gemma, the 57 year-old wife of Clay,  the motorcycle club's  leader and mother of Jax, the young vice-president of the club. There is competition between Jax and Clay  until they come together in an effort to avenge the crime against Gemma.  In the meanwhile there is danger and bloodshed throughout, each episode a complete story within itself but yet connected to the overall theme of the  series.<br /><br />The other characters from Season One are all there - the hard boiled and beautiful female federal agent, the two cops in the town of Charming who compete with each other, Jax's doctor girlfriend and all the assorted club members with their own personalities, styles and back stories.<br /><br />Again, the last episode was the most violent and a real cliffhanger. I can't wait to watch Season 3.

0811876373|5.0|I love this book! I love cake pops, not so much making them. They are much harder work than I thought, or maybe I'm just lazy. I made twelve and had to stop. here's a few things I learned that are not in the book.<br /><br />You can use peanut butter, cream cheese.....just about anything sticky to bind the cake. This way you can adjust the sweetness of the filling. If you use pure peanut butter.....your pop may come out saltier than you would like, so test it out first. (I kind of liked mine a little saltier, my cake pop ended up tasting like reese's pieces). Or do half peanut butter, half frosting or whatever. My next idea is make chocolate ganache and use that as a binder. just melt chocolate chips, cream (or milk) and butter, stir until smooth and add to crumbled cake. (I detest store bought frosting).<br /><br />I made two cakes, one boxed strawberry and one boxed chocolate. The strawberry cake was so moist that when I put only 1/2 cup of frosting it was extremely mushy and hard to place on a stick, even when chilled. I didn't have any extra cake on hand so I crumbled up some bread and added it to the mix to dry it up, worked great.<br /><br />The chocolate cake however, was a tad dryer and it came out perfect. So the point is to start with just a little frosting. Good luck and have fun! After I made the cake pops I couldn't stand even to look at anything sweet. They tasted better the next day.
B002GJT4YQ|2.0|The extended version has trouble keeping the vocals aligned  with the actors.  I don't think we've ever been able to see the extended version b/c to get the vocal & acting together we stop the movie and go to scene selection and it bounces back to the original version.  The behind the scenes is very well done.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app is well worth the dollar, maybe more. Amazing sketch/doodling capability with a wide variety of brush strokes and sizes. Text can be entered and rotated, same can be done with the sketch you have drawn. Best of all there are 6 layers that can be added (more would have been better but one cannot complain too much)  and shown/hidden just like photoshop. This just increases the capability of this app as one can load a photo in one layer and increase its transperancy to sketch over it in another layer. Nuf said. Works without any force close issues on the xoom and looks good too.
0525422943|4.0|A year and a half ago I read a book called \\"If I Stay\\" by Gayle Foreman. The story focused on one of life's most daunting decisions...move on in death, or return to a shatter world. The book was sad, and beautiful, and taught a very difficult lesson. Cherish the ones that you love, hold them dear and not take advantage of their existence, because you never know when that predicted existence may be quickly taken from you.<br /><br />\\"If I Stay\\" (though abruptly finished) was a complete story, so when I found out that Ms. Foreman decided to write a follow-up I was confused. However, when I finally got around to reading \\"Where She Went\\" I understood immediately why she had.<br /><br />(If you have NOT read \\"If I Stay\\" (and plan to) Please stop reading. AKA... there are spoilers)<br /><br />It has been three years since Mia's crash. Three horrible, unforgiveable, excruciating years, but not in the way that you would think. Things with Mia are just fine. Adam (her boyfriend at the time of the crash) on the other hand is self destructing. After being handing marching orders by Mia, Adam is forced to face his harsh (tabloid driven) life without the comfort of the only person who understands him, and being uncertain as to how to handle things, he resorts to bitterness and booze. With his world crumbling around him, and memories flooding his every thought, Adam decides to take a break. Just a quick one really, a walk through the park, but when he stumbles upon a flyer announcing Mia's next concert he suddenly realizes his past will forever haunt his future unless he confronts it. With only one night left ahead of him to make amends or set her free for good Adam goes for it. Will Mia ever fully understand what she did to him? Will seeing her help or hinder Adams ability to let go, and will the reality of life keep them from saying the things they should have said three years ago?<br /><br />While I enjoyed \\"If I Stay\\" I thought \\"Where She Went\\" blew it out of the water. The choice to abandon Mia as the main character and to focus on Adam was heartbreaking but (I think) a wise decision. In \\"If I Stay\\" we are introduced to Adam as Mia \\"everything\\". The reason she chose to return to her life. So returning to the story three years later only to find out that Adam and Mia are no longer together was (in some parts) physically painful. The story (like the first) was written with a handful of flashbacks, but the means of communication between the two were drastically different. While Mia is a musician, she is not a songwriter like Adam, and when Foreman chose to change her lead character, the ability witness pain through lyrics, and poetic inner dialogue suddenly became available. It is important to note (though my love for the book is telling me not to) that the story is a bit slow in places, and I think there was a perfect moment (about 1 chapter from the end) that would have served as a better ending, but overall...a very good read for someone who doesn't mind emotional journeys.<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: Life is too short to be saddled with half truths.

0783225547|4.0|I liked Dante's Peak. This is the only 1990s volcano disaster movie that matters. It is well written, directed, and accurate.    The elements of suspense and surprise are maintained through the entire movie. The name of the town is foreboding. One gets the feeling as the movie progresses that the actors are proceeding through various torturous punishments of Dante Alighieri's Inferno. The characters experience real injuries and real human suffering. The shocking first scene drew me in immediately and set the tone for the entire movie.    Dante's Peak is a classic doomsayer-gets-it-right tale. Pierce Brosnan brings just the right personality to that role. While it is true that the USGS might have had sufficient information to sound the alarm even in the 1990s, if a team of USGS-sponsored geeks had alerted the mayor, he would have listened, none of the events in the movie would have taken place, and the movie would be called \\"The Orderly Evacuation and Rebuilding of Dante's Peak\\". Bo-ring!     Factual analysis: The portrayal of a volcanic eruption in the Cascades and its effects on the landscape is shockingly realistic. The special effects, pyroclastic eruptions, corrosive sulfuric acid mudflows, tephra and explosive eruptions, are very well done, and most occur in the proper sequence. The only part that required much suspension of disbelief is the scene where the hero's SUV gets stuck in a pahoehoe (Hawaiian, not Cascadian) lava flow and miraculously escapes without even a flat tire. I suppose that was inserted over the protests of the scientific advisers (and common sense) due to the need for \\"edge of the seat\\" suspense. This is an action movie, after all.    Overall, I thought the movie was very well made and directed, and I appreciate the fact that the writers insisted on realism over Hollywood spectacle (although in this movie, the realistic parts are spectacular indeed).

Ip Man (greatest Of All Time) teaches Bruce Lee( the great)... donnie Yen is my new favorite Martial Arts guy...Jet Li is still my boy too.
B00428CPUY|5.0|I went to the 2007 show with two of my best friends, and it was without a doubt one of the best days of my life.  That soccer arena on the South Side is not a huge venue, and there are absolutely no bad seats in the house.    Where do I start?  I love nearly all the music, and even the stuff I'm not crazy about is expertly done and easy to listen to.  The 2010 DVD is even better than the 2004 and 2007 ones, and they were incredible.    I love the loose snippets of history, all these great musicians hanging out backstage and enjoying each others' sets, the reverent nods to their shared roots and inspiration, the camaraderie, and the mutual respect (no egos or tantrums in sight).  It makes me feel like this is a big party for them too.      And it's not just a geezer-fest.  They brought in new acts like John Mayer and (as one previous reviewer mentioned) Orianthi, as well as a twenty-something GC competition winner every year.  I remember looking around me in 2007 at all the middle-aged, pudgy, suburban hubbydaddies just like me, in their baseball caps, prescription sunglasses and cargo shorts, their wives watching over the beer coolers and beach chairs.  Then Derek Trucks started his set, and a huge wave of college-age stoner dudes rushed the stage.  I realized all those people brought their kids along, too.  It's a big-city version of the Fourth of July picnic in the park, except the gazebo band is FREAKIN' ERIC CLAPTON.    I also love how they just toss genre out the window from square one.  Roots, Country, Rock, Jazz, Swing, Fusion -- if it's guitar-centered, it's on.    Is he going to do it again in 2013?  I'm there.  Until then, I've got this DVD.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|they did an excellent job with this movie! the special affects are incredible! and they portrayed everything pretty well, i was impressed. i cannot wait for part 2 to come out! one bummer, not about the movie, is it took amazon forever to actually get it to me. but i did get it for $5 cheaper then i could find anywhere else...
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have quite a few older iPod speakers that no longer charge current iPods, iPhones and iPads. This small little device had brought direct sound and charging to these still usable devices. If you are looking for something that will allow you to fully utilize your newer iDevices with your older speakers, this works wonders. My issue is small - I need something to support my iPad when I use it on the iPod HiFi. So Far, it just works.
B004I1AGTM|5.0|I personally liked part Ip Man 1 better, but this one is Kick Ass fun too, i really wish that the Lee family (Bruce Lee) would have allowed this movie to cover the father/son relationship between bruce and Master Ip...but all in all i am hooked on the Ip man series, i loved the hell out of the first one and i also love this one.
B00005R8GU|5.0|The backstory: Marshall Chess was licking his wounds over the savaging he took from the neo-psychedelicised albums he'd produced notoriously for Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Mike Bloomfield, a friend from high school and a musician who'd learned most of his blues at the feet and the sides of Waters and the other Chicago blues masters, suggested to the youngest Chess that he think of an album on which Waters would be supported by the younger blues revivalists who'd learned from or been inspired by him otherwise.    To his eternal credit, Chess ran with the idea. He saw and raised Bloomfield, who'd first made his bones and his reputation by wheedling his way into jamming with Muddy and the like in his late, audacious, and troubled teens. He enlisted Stax stalwart Duck Dunn to play bass; Sam Lay, Bloomfield's old running mate in the Butterfield Blues Band and Howlin' Wolf's former stage drummer, and then playing in the Waters band after recuperating from the illness that took him out of the Butterfield lineup; Buddy Miles, then running his Buddy Miles Express (out of the remnant of the ill-fated Electric Flag) on Mercury; Paul Butterfield himself; and, Otis Spann, Muddy's longtime keyboard stalwart now launched on his own tragically short-lived career (he would die of cancer in 1970), who ditched a New York club engagement to do this project.    The idea was to record the sessions around Bloomfield and Butterfield's plans for a Chicago charity performance in April 1969, with Marshall Chess and another high school running mate of his and Bloomfield's, the producer Norman Dayron, picking the right material out of the Waters vaults for these young turks to cut with the masters. They even hunted down (probably at Bloomfield's suggestion, and who's to say he didn't contribute from his own stock of the stuff) out vintage Fender amplifiers. Then, he kept the champagne flowing for Muddy and the beers flowing for the young turks, rounded them into new recording facilities on21st Street, and let them cut loose.     The purists still smirk over whether the young turks were intimidated into submission, but what actually transpires is young sons paying the daddies who taught them their blues respect without lapsing into obsequiousness. Bloomfield may be somewhat restrained in many turns, but in others he lets just the right amount loose to wrap his elders without smothering them. Likewise for Butterfield, who shines precisely by reining himself in at the precise strategic moments. Anchored by the Lay-Dunn rhythm section (Miles doesn't show up until a portion of the concert that produced the live sides), with Dunn obviously thrilled to join up to one of the Chicago blues legends (Lay's almost freewheeling approach must have been a huge vacation for a Dunn who was accustomed to Al Jackson, Jr.'s tautly deep groove), Waters is more relaxed with his blues than he seems to have been for too many years, and Spann as usual is a model of self-assurance over the piano, playing almost as though they were younger, fresher, and making the best of what they had in the old Chess studios.    Maybe the best exercise of the studio portion is \\"You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had,\\" originally a haunting single for Waters in 1964 but now a deeper, more harrowing performance precisely because these are men, young and old, steeped in its message and barely able to escape it no matter how enthusiastically they play it. Bloomfield unfurls perhaps the most wrenching solo of his time on the project; Butterfield blows as though crying up from a grave; and Lay's drumming could be mistaken for the Grim Reaper having a perverse laugh as he stomps across the boneyard, while Waters sings it as though he's only wrapped its implications for the first time, looked the bastard in the eye, and fought him to a draw. But if you need other references to begin, go no further than the set opener, a remake of \\"All Aboard\\" (itself Muddy's original re-imaginging of \\"Mystery Train\\") that chugs so furiously yet atmospherically it damn near leaves Muddy's original on the platform, particularly buttressed by a very sensitive harmonica support from Butterfield.    The concert sides are exuberant, celebratory, yet sober, each musician staying within himself, the whole becoming something almost greater than the sum of its parts. Marshall Chess's own epitaph is a better review than I could offer here: \\"The sound of five thousand kids singing 'I've Got My Mojo Working' is the most powerful thing I've ever heard,\\" he said of the concert side closer, in two parts, Miles coming in to play part two, and the entire ensemble driving the chestnut so far home---Spann particularly is working the pistons as though they had his name on them---that if you blink you see only the exhaust of the motors.    It's as if Muddy Waters took it for precisely the career reviver it almost was for him. It became the best-selling recording of his career to date and, while he had a few innings still to play before Chess collapsed entirely as a working label, it proved to be the pilot fish for what made his real career revival---in Johnny Winter's respectful hands---erupt for keeps in 1978, with \\"Hard Again.\\" As with \\"Fathers & Sons,\\" Waters in 1978 went back to his absolute basics, with likewise sympatico musicians, and enjoyed best-selling albums and big concert rewards for the rest of his life, and it was only his due.    But it is only fair to say the seed was planted, with the album he cut with the men he taught explicitly and often directly, when Mike Bloomfield's almost offhand suggestion to his old high school buddy turned into a working project and, in time, a best-selling album that just might be the last of the classic Chess blues gasps. Howlin' Wolf himself would get very close to this mojo with his \\"London Howlin' Wolf Sessions\\" (with Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts anchoring the proceedings), but close isn't paydirt. None of the blues supersessions to follow in the years to come---not Wolf or Muddy's London exercises; not Albert King's noble exercise with Stevie Ray Vaughan; not the Albert Collins-Johnny Copeland-Robert Cray goonbash; not even \\"Riding with the King,\\" B.B. King's loving exercise with Eric Clapton---have ever equaled \\"Fathers & Sons\\" for the pleasure and the revelation of revisiting the blues with deep feeling and unbridled joy.

B0047Y17P2|4.0|Great story in typical Connelly fashion. Enjoyable for both fans and first time Connelly readers. Reviewers with issues on pricing have the right to gripe but shouldn't provide a poor review when it's unrelated to the quality of the story. Enjoy!

B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have to tell you right up front that I am completely enamored by this record. I did not expect to be and did not want to start this review off with a negative so there you have it. Enamored.<br /><br />I never thought a whole lot of Stevie Nicks' solo career. She was the force behind the last evolution of Fleetwood Mac and she deserves a place of fame for that. But I always felt she did not stand too well on her own - almost as if she needed a strong supporting cast to make it work. That plus the whole mystical witch thing and I figured it was mostly music for women who read bad novels about unicorns and vampires. But, like most men of my era, I could not look past her sensual warble and overall hotness so I gave her plenty of room.<br /><br />I bought In Your Dreams almost as a novelty. When an aging and prominent rocker of my era lays out a new disc it's worth seeing what they are up to. I have done it many times in the past few years. But I was not prepared for the tour de force that is Stevie Nicks' new record.<br /><br />The album lights off with a commanding establishment of Stevie's still-strong vocal chops and her surprisingly non-mystical writing. Secret Love expresses everyone's desire - love, or at least some semblance of it:<br /><br />I am not asking for forever from you<br />I'm just asking to be held for awhile<br /><br />Lyrically this song demands some examination from anyone on the path of life and love. And sonically Stevie's voice is strong and sure, with that same quality we used to love but perhaps tempered or matured. This song is all about that timeless search and is surprisingly full of profundity:<br /><br />I am not asking for salvation from you<br />I'm just asking to be saved for awhile.<br /><br />That song alone has more content and passion than the last dozen albums by name-your-favorite-vacuous-pop-star. And we're just getting started.<br /><br />For What It's Worth comes across to me as a study in Stevie's history and life in Rock & Roll - \\"I got to sing, I got dance\\". Stevie's lovely warble shines to perfection here as she talks of life and love and loss. She sings as someone who knows the desire and goal of life is to love but it doesn't always work out that way - \\"We knew it couldn't last, and that was hard\\". She recognizes that life isn't a fairy tale. But Ms. Nicks had the life of a rock goddess and music was her true love, her constant, her destiny. A sad and beautiful song.<br /><br />In Your Dreams sweeps away the melancholy and brings us a high-energy song that would have fit the peak era of Fleetwood Mac. We are immediately sent guessing - who is she singing about. I will tell you my theory in a minute. The bottom line here is that all that pain and tears aren't necessary - because \\"it's a beautiful day.\\" And a fine segue into Wide Sargasso Sea. I can't help but be firmly convinced that this is about her relationship with Mick Fleetwood back-in-the-day. Lots of passion here and allusions to burning down his house while escaping herself. Hmmm.<br /><br />Next up is a song about New Orleans. What is it about N.O.? I have never been but people get impassioned when they sing about it. Stevie makes me almost want to go and see for myself. And clever and deep writing makes it more compelling:<br /><br />In the midst of the sea of dreams<br />Lies a perfect storm<br />In a sea of tears<br />Lies a city ghost<br /><br />Throw in some Anne Rice and vampire references and it is pretty interesting writing. Plus the music is simply gorgeous and her vocal hooks compelling.<br /><br />These next two look like they take us down that Welsh witch path to loony mysticism that causes me to fear her music. But Moonlight is actually an old song revisited and appears to be largely autobiographical. It certainly describes her past and her loves and carries a definite Fleetwood Mac tone to boot. She claims to have paid a big price for the life she has lived and she creates a twilight world of rock and roll genius examining what was and what could never be. This song almost hurts lyrically. It is the perfect set up for Annabel Lee, a Nicks / Edgar Allan Poe collaboration that makes perfect sense. Stevie Nicks is probably the only Rock & Roll diva who could pull this off:<br /><br />But our love was stronger by far than the love<br />Of those who were older than we<br />Of many far wiser than we<br />And neither the angels in heaven above<br />Nor the demons down under the sea<br />Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br />Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.<br /><br />I hear some wishful thinking in there and this song is sweeping and majestic and romantic.<br /><br />Soldier's Angel was challenging for me because it seems so out of place. It has a very heavy handed Lindsey Buckingham vibe to it, not a bad thing, but a little too dark and morose for the rest of the proceedings. But apparently Stevie has done some work with war vets in D.C. and I think this song illuminates that idea that we are all connected to war. None of us are left out of the battles as a spouse or parent or lover or just friend and we all pay a price. We are all at war - a thought worth advancing in a culture that doesn't understand that concept.<br /><br />The next three are continued reflections on Stevie's life and loves in the rock & roll world of fame and fortune. Everybody Loves You means what it says. Ghosts Are Gone sounds like it came from a Country & Western bar and is packed with ideas of revelation and resolution on what is gone. And You May Be The One is a gorgeous blues number that features the absolutely heavenly backup vocals of Sharon Celani and Lori Nicks (who you can hear sprinkled throughout this record).<br /><br />Italian Summer is a lush romantic memory of a more-than-pleasant experience. We have all had these times that stick in our minds - one of mine is ten days in March in 2008 in Monterey, and all the memories and thoughts are even and pleasant. This song carries those ideas in simple phrases like \\"you put down that guitar and handed me a rose\\". The message is strong and clear of deep romance and warm melancholy.<br /><br />The disc finishes up with Cheaper Than Free and it's almost too much. But it is a sweet song especially after all the above and asks important questions like:<br /><br />What does money not buy?<br />You and I.<br /><br />Grammatically incorrect but simply and remarkably true. This song sums up that it is brighter, warmer, better, deeper and more exciting, this life and love that we find along the way. A beautiful song, sung as a duet with Dave Stewart, and in the hands of a young pop star it would have fallen flat. But it rings true considering the source, well-versed in the ways of life.<br /><br />And that is really where this album shines. It is not a caricature of an aging pop star. It is strong and sure, vulnerable but wise. And not at all mystical but real and practical while being shockingly romantic. Stevie Nicks is not singing from songs written for her. She is singing 62 years of life & love & regrets & passion & pain. And you get to hear it, feel it, experience it with her. You can relate to some or all of it because it is real.<br /><br />And I have to throw in this idea I had while I listened to this repeatedly in my car on a trip without benefit of album notes or the internet. I felt that this album was largely a reflection on one of rock's great love stories - Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. And in another universe and another time, maybe one filled with moonbeams and unicorns, those two would have married and lived a life in the suburbs while raising a family, blissfully in love. But the world of fame is hard on romance.<br /><br />There is nothing cool or cutting edge or even edgy about this record. It is simply beautiful and majestic and right. If you have lived and loved you can take part in Stevie Nicks' musical and lyrical journey, the album of a lifetime.<br /><br />Bravo, Bella Donna. Bravo.Free and it's almost too much.

B000V8E3C2|5.0|I only quite recently gotten into classical music and bought this album on a binge a few months ago with a lot of other classical music. I bought it mostly because of The Moldau. But listening to the album it grew near and dear very quickly and I found the music to be very accessible and memorable, to the point that I feel like I've known it all my life. It music is stunning, beautiful but also dramatic, powerful, dynamic and full of life. I wholeheartedly recommend this album, and unless you're a rock, you're gonna love it too.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|After listening to Give Up the Ghost, I purchased this album as well as her first album (self titled).  I can see her development from album to album (gave her third album 5 stars).  The common thread in all of her albums is her incredible voice which brings both passion and feeling.  But, with each album there is a sense of growing maturity to her music and lyric choices.  The title song (The Story) is powerful and the messages delivered in each song in this CD are just as meaningful as those on her third album.  Listen to the samples but to truly appreciate the talent that Brandi Carlile has, you need to listen to each track in full and let her music embrace and envelope you.  She possesses a chrisma that only a few entertainers can claim. \\"So many stories of where I've been...And how I got to where I am...But these stories don't mean anything...When you've got no one to tell them to...\\" (Brandi Carlile's The Story).
0670022411|4.0|I enjoyed this story about Demons, Witches, and Vampires, living around humans.  I really liked the main hero, Matthew Clairmont, very sexy and interesting but I did not care for the female, Diana Bishop, I felt she was bi-polar in some of her thinking.  I won't go into details but she would be telling everyone she could take care of herself and the next thing she is clinging to Matthew, asking for his help.  Another thing about this author, I don't like the taste of wine but I was really tempted to go buy a $100 bottle and see if I could experience the sun shining over the hills of Italy or the first taste of spring in the air in my glass of wine.  Another note, this book made me want to drink hot herbal tea all the time.  I will read the the next part of this story.
0393338827|5.0|A well written and highly entertaining account of the 2008 housing crisis and the ensuing financial meltdown.  Filled with insights about what was happening behind the scenes within the housing industry, the mortgage backed securities industry, and the impact of a few hedge funds, both large and small.  A quick read that's hard to put down.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|. . who are responding to the pricing of this item.  Love the book (first one), by the way.  I'm just getting started, after having started watching the HBO series.    However, if we don't protest these prices (35 for kindle edition, 20 bucks for paperback bundle), then they will keep gouging us.  This is ABSOLUTELY the right place to do it.  I understand there are costs involved with producing a Kindle edition.  However, after that, there are NO INCREMENTAL COSTS.  You tell me:  what costs Amazon and the publishers more?  Sending you a book in three seconds that probably has less data in in than a voice mail, or growing/hauling/making paper/printing/binding/shipping/warehousing/retailing these books?    I did not pay 400 (DX) and then 130 again (K3) just to get gouged again by the publisher.  And yest I know the publisher sets the prices, not Amazon. So be it.  I'm reviewing the publisher.  The e-version should be the same price as, or less than, the cheapest print price.  Otherwise it makes no sense.    Dear Amazon:  I ain't mad.  Actually, I love you.  Just making my voice heard.  Why don't you do a study on similarly priced books and show the publishers how they are being received.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|It may be just that I love vampyre books, but this teenage story reminded me a lot of how I dreamed life would be like when I was teen. Wonderful detail and I like the view of vampyres and that humans know they exist in these books.
B004Q3RKH8|5.0|I recently decided to go the vinyl route for new music purchases and one of the first LPs that I bought were the Pearl Jam reissues on vinyl, basically because the PJ guys are vinyl freaks (in a good way) so I knew that this release would not disappoint.    I had purchased Vitalogy years ago on CD, but the vinyl version sounds SOOOOO much better! Of course, this can be interpreted as a case of what I like to call \\"Vinyl Ears\\", the music-listening equivalent of \\"Beer Goggles\\" in which one thinks that everything sounds better on vinyl just because...    Anyway, if you already own Vitalogy on CD or MP3 and are considering upgrading to vinyl, DO IT! You will not regret it. The music is (mostly) amazing and the packaging is absolutely beautiful. The only con I can think of is that this is a double LP, when it should have been just one record. All they needed to do was cut \\"Aye Davanita\\" and \\" Stupid Mop\\" and the record would have clocked in at 45 mins.    Viva La Vinyl!
0307454541|4.0|\\"The Girl WIth the Dragon Tattoo\\" centers around the disappearance and presumed cold-case murder of the niece of Henrik Vanger, a wealthy Swedish businessman. When he hires veteran journalist and recently convicted libelist Mikael Blomkvist to help him solve the mystery, Vanger sends Blomkvist into an investigation far grittier than those of the financiers and corporate scandals he's accustomed to. With the help of a brilliant young woman who sidelines as a personal investigator (and who is the girl with the tattoo), Lisbeth Salander, Blomkvist learns to rethink his traditional journalist's tendencies and digs into both the Vanger case and the case he had begun to build against the businessman who charged him with libel. Steig Larsson's best seller is definitely outside my normal reading, but I really enjoyed it. Be warned that the opening is slow and getting all of the information and characters organized is a bit cumbersome at first, but once the real mystery at the core of the novel starts unfolding, it's easy to get hooked. Blomkvist is simple and straightforward, whereas Salander is kick-ass and complex. I loved the way she fought for herself and ultimately for other women throughout the book. Also a warning that it does contain some graphic, rated R moments, but it's well-worth the hype it's been given.
B003Y5D776|5.0|I was curious to see if this interface would work for my son who is a recording artist, he needed to do some work at home and this fit in just fine with the other equipment purchased, many said this would never work ... we proved them wrong and saved over $100.00 thanks to ingenuity and Amazon!

B001G70M6S|5.0|I have had a lot of fun using this film. Now it's by no means a surefire thing as in you're going to waste a few bucks/shots getting some setting wrong or developing it wrong but that's the gamble of old instant film.    But if you DO get it right the shots are absolutely gorgeous and as noted by other reviewers, the contrast and clarity is great.    The whole dual tab pulling thing is definitely tricky. And even after using these for a bit you'll probably still botch one but heck, it's only a dollar. You'll make it.
B001UV4XI8|2.0|We ordered the Blu-ray from Amazon for delivery on the release date because the price was better than anywhere locally.   Imagine our disappointment when we put the disk in to watch it and it stopped working after about five minutes.  We watched the DVD version, but went out and replaced it the next day from C****o; cost a little bit more, but we knew that we could get an exchange or money back if it didn't work (it did play just fine).  Amazon handled the return and refund just fine, but I have decided I would rather buy locally so that if there is a problem I can just swap it immediately instead of waiting for a replacement through the mail.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I chose to buy this book (ebook) because of the show on HBO. I was enthralled with it. Never in a million years did I realize how captivating the book would be. So often the book and show/movie don't move along the same lines of story telling, or a lot is left out.  Not this series, the show is (so far) following it sooo closely it's uncanny. And I have emersed myself so deeply in this series of books, I feel as though I have a second home. The story, characters, plots, all are so well written it draws you into a world so clear you hate to put it down and come back to real life...I think about it when I'm not reading it, trying to figure out where the plots will take me, hoping the 'good guys' will win out, and everytime I am surprised by what happens. It is 'the most' compelling, enthralling, mesmerizing series I have ever had the fortune to pick up. I buy the next book when I am half way done with the current one I'm reading simply because once I'm done I don't want to have to go online and get it. I want it right there ready and waiting so I can keep reading. These books are just that good!!! Kudos to George R. R. Martin for creating such a wonderful world for me to live in.....it's truly an amazing one!!!
B002ZG99QS|5.0|All I can say is wow!  I was not expecting such a wonderful mesh between that classic of the 80's and a visual masterpiece of current day.  The music, the computer graphics; everything.  All I can say is that I know the folks who worked so hard on the original, must have loved the dedication to keep the feel of the sequel right on point.  Thank you to all who made this movie.  Watching this movie made me feel like a kid watching the original; while at the same time appealing to the side of me who appreciates all the advancements in technology.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Waiting for update for may. Game is addictive cant put down even for a second. I love the original and the seasons additions
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I installed the update, but no new levels... HELP! I want to squash monkeys in the beach!! Please send a REAL update, please....
B003EYVXYG|3.0|definately not Georges' best work, but a nice add to the collection. seems they went for a more comic feel with this movie rather then blood guts and 10 minute zombie flesh eating scenes. one thumb up.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie portrays the life of a man simply trying to survive in a world that has forgotten what it means to be human.  Students in 8th grade can easily appreciate the struggles.  It's a must-show for WWII teachers.
B003UESJH4|4.0|A good film but America (as you know, I'm sure) your ancestors had the intelligence to stand up to the ridiculous toy-town nonsense that is royalty. Much more interesting stories in your wonderful founding fathers...Jefferson, Adams, Thomas Paine.
B000003TAR|5.0|I have had the chance to listen to Nirvana's 3rd studio album at a whole, and I have to say. This is a fantastic release from a great band. Nirvana couldn't have released a better followup to another groundbreaking album, Nevermind. This album is full of great songs such as Pennyroyal Tea, Heart Shaped Box, Very Ape, All Apologies ect. This album is worth a listen if you like any of Nirvana's other releases or want to hear the band's later sound. Kurt Cobain's vocals and guitar are top knotch, Krist Novoselics bass playing skills are amazing, and Dave Grohl is one of the best drummers I've ever heard. This album was well produced with Steve Albini's recording skills. Overall, you get a lot of talent in one cd. I recommend this to all Nirvana fans or punk/grunge fans. Thanks for reading! Enjoy the album!
159420229X|5.0|First and foremost, I have to say that Eagle Book is a very competent and professional company. They handle themselves with the utmost professionalism. To get to the point, customers ordering products from Eagle Book that are in the US, please be advised that most items will be shipped from the UK (may take up to 3-4 weeks for item to arrive). I have made the mistake of ordering an item that I expected in 3 to 4 business days (the usual) which didn't arrive until a month later. I was furious, but nonetheless, careless in paying attention to detail. Eagle Book has resolved the issue in the most orthodox way, they credited my account for the item as well as shipped it free of charge.    So please be advised that if your ordering from Eagle Book and your within the states (US) be prepared to fall into a coma, only to wake up a month later to an arrived item lol. In contrast, they are great and I thank them for their patients and low prices.    P.s. I cant wait for the book to arrive, I'm so anxious to read it (still waiting lol)      -Eddie Zee
B003Y5H54W|4.0|I will admit that when I went to see Red Riding Hood, I was expecting it to be like Twilight (being a twihard fan) and was actually disappointed.  To all these people who reference it to Twilight must not have seen Twilight.  The only revelance it has to Twilight was the great scenery and the supposed love triangle which to me was a distant background part of the Red Riding Hood movie.  In Twilight, the main theme of the movie is the love story/triangle.  In Red Riding Hood, the main theme of the movie was finding and killing the Big Bad Wolf.  Not even close to the Twilight story. But all in all, it was an entertaining movie.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Great attention to detail and great cast for this movie. It captured my attention completely. And although it was a time period where things moved much slower between a man and a woman, it is well worth watching the character development of this film.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Being a Big Fan of The Foo Fighters, but also a person who usually despises \\"Greatest Hits\\" type albums I have to say that this one has hit the nail on the head! You have to understand that even though I LOVE The band, unlike other bands I fall for I never went out and got the entire catalogue of their albums (I usually get EVERYTHING in print by my favorites). That being said I am actually Glad that I didn't go that route with this band, or I wouldn't have discovered what a GREAT album this one is. Sure, I have a 'few' CDs by them, and they have SO MANY well deserved 'Hits' it's hard to figure out which ones are actually gonna be chosen for such an album. Well I'm here to tell you that they really used some wisdom with this selection AND the order of the tunes couldn't be better!  After hearing this about a hundred times so far, NOW it's time to go get the rest of the Foo Fighter caralogue!  Definatey awesome!
B0042MEQVG|1.0|This movie isn't really even about vampires.  It's more like an after school special or something that should play on the Hallmark channel. And what's up with all the guys with no shirts off?  Shouldn't the story be more important.  If you want to see a good vampire movie, see Interview With The Vampire or Blade.  This movie bites!
B004LL1HM4|3.0|Fleet Foxes have returned from their tours and studio sessions to release another album! I have been keeping up with the band since their first major release, the [[ASIN:B0014DBZX8 Sun Giant EP]]. I have been eagerly awaiting their next big release. They haven't retraced themselves: the album has an entirely different feel than anything they have put out prior. This isn't a \\"Fleet Foxes II\\" and that's a good thing.  The album hasn't grown on me as quickly as their first two releases. This album almost feels like a rough home album that Robin made with his band as a back-up. I think this is mostly because there are not as many vocal harmonies as with their first two releases. That was one of the disappointments I have had with this record; Fleet Foxes vocal harmonies are gorgeous. It is unusual to me to hear Robin singing solo so much on a record.   The instrumentation is really rad. There are many new and interesting sounds on this record, and with every replay, you always find something new. However, you won't get lost from the exotic instrumentation: their good 'ol acoustic guitar always brings you home.   The CD packaging is great. It includes a over-sized poster of the album cover, lyrics in the gate-fold, and their CD is inside a paper slip-case, just like a vinyl album. VERY cool!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|The only game I play is LoL, this thing makes my toon \\"is God like\\". G13 is not only good for games, it's also an awesome tool for Wacom tablet users. Besides be able to assign a single key stroke on its keypad, it also can create macro so that you can have function like \\"Alt + right mouse button down\\" or a sequence of key strokes plus mouse clicks to a single key. Macros enable you to do tasks without ever needing to use the two awkward buttons on the stylus.     G13's thumb joystick is a very useful tool as well. For example, for zoom in and out in Photoshop. I set it up so when the joystick is pushed to the right,  it triggers Ctrl + Space for zoom in. Then I just tab or drag the stylus on the tablet. You can pretty much set it up any way you like. If you can't live without a Wacom tablet, then you should really give this thing a try. I highly recommended it, job well done Logitech!
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Highschool of the dead is a zombie anime with plenty of action, ecchi, and funny situations. The story starts out in the private high school of the character Takashi when he first starts to see the zombie plague spreading in his school his first reaction is to try to save the girl that hes loved (Rei) since he was a small child by picking her up from her classroom and getting her to<br />a safe place. The situation quickly escalates as the infection spreads to the whole school and they quickly have to evacuate the school to get to a safer place. Along the way they meet other students and a nurse who have survived the zombie plague and they make their escape from the zombie infested school to the city.<br /><br />Much of the film is spent running from zombies and taking shelter from place to place while showing how the world has turned into total chaos and anarchy all around them as the zombie plague spreads.There are so many scenes with bouncing boobies, naughty poses, revealing outfits and girls moaning over anything that it feels like im watching a porno film with action in it. Not to say thats a bad thing but sometimes it feels like its a little over the top for a normal anime.<br /><br />The first season was pretty short (12 episodes) but it had some good foundations laid out for character relationships in season 2 (mostly Rei & Saeko with Takashi) or possibly even Saya with Kohta after seeing episode 12 (although she likes Takashi alot more). It will be interesting to see a season 2 if they ever make one to see if any of the other main characters familys survived the zombie plague and to find out what the cause of the plague was to begin with.<br /><br />Pros<br />--------------<br />- Lots of Action (makes it fun to watch)<br />- Lots of huge bouncing Boobies (what guy doesnt like boobies?)<br />- Nude scenes (The shower episode was epic)<br />- Never a dull moment<br />- Funny Jokes and scenes (Example: \\"All these zombies and im going to get killed by an Asian woman driver\\" -Kohta)<br />- No Fillers<br />- No Censors (who would want all the good stuff cut out?)<br />- Great Music soundtrack<br /><br />Cons<br />--------------<br />- The credits play before the end of each episode, never seen any other animes do this only this one. Why would they play the credits before the whole episode is finished? they probably really want people to read the credits.<br />- No Second season out yet.<br />- Price is a little high at $39 for 5 hours worth of content on 2 blu-ray disc (12 episodes).<br /><br />Conclusion<br />--------------<br />It might be a really long time until they release a second season of this show but I definitely enjoyed the show enough to buy the first season for $39. I just hope that they make a second season soon as the first one was very entertaining to watch and im curious to see how the characters continue to develop.n woman driver\\" -Kohta)<br />- No Fillers<br />- No Censors (who would want all the good stuff cut out?)<br />- Great Music soundtrack<br /><br />Cons<br />--------------<br />- The credits play before the end of each episode, never seen any other animes do this only this one.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|You really are going to make me pay for the May update.  You have to be kidding me.  Really poor job on how you are handling this Amazon.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|I wouldn't say this movie lived up to the hype that various movie critics had built up around it, but it was still an enjoyable movie. What was interesting about this movie was all the information I learned about the founding of the (in)famous website, Facebook. Clearly, I had heard of Mark Zuckerburg's name before, but what I did not realize was how much drama was really involved. His peers ended up suing him for taking their ideas without giving due credit, and Zuckerburg was a truly unpleasant, self-centered man.<br /><br />Of course, you would have to take everything in the movie with a grain of salt. The movie is based on a book, [[ASIN:0307740986 The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal]], which in turn is based on alleged conversations that occurred regarding the development of Facebook. The author of that book did not interview everyone, not even Mark Zuckerburg, so you can't automatically believe everything presented to you in this movie. But whether the facts in the film are true or not, the film itself is pretty enjoyable. The actors play their lines well, and if you like sarcastic humor, you should love this movie because there is a lot of it.<br /><br />At some moments I feel like the film moves a little too slowly and becomes boring, but it should still keep up the attention of most people throughout the time. Do see it if you want to to know the history of Facebook.
1844137872|5.0|I bought Wall and Piece after discovering Banksy through his film Exit Through the Gift Shop & was surprised and pleased at the  high quality of the book for the price. it is a beautiful, often humorous, sometimes poignant, and frequently insightful collection of images of Banksy's rogue street art intermixed with stories about creating his works and information about the location, country, or peoples he encountered. I'm not sure whether Banksy would be flattered or offended but this really is the perfect book for a guest room night stand or summer house coffee table.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Ive been a fan of evangelion for awhile.  Out of all the anime shows ive seen this is without a doubt my favorite.  Ive never seen a show with such amazing characters I mean even though Shinji is kind of an anti-hero he is still my fav character cause he's so messed up but in the end is so cool.  If your a fan of the series than this is for you EVANGELION IS BACK AND IS STILL #1.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|If you want a basic knife that's sturdy, thick, comfortable, and simple and also comes with a great sheath, then this is your knife.  Just know that it is a bit heavy since it's a big hunk of steel, and it also seems to be designed with medium to large hands in mind.  I have large hands, and this is the best feeling knife I have, but I think it might be awkward for someone with small hands.  Also, if you're looking for more of a chopper, get the bk7 instead for that extra couple inches of blade length.      I have yet to see a better survival type knife for this price!
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|I would recommend watching \\"The Reader\\" because it shows an excellent contrast between the way different generations of Germans handled and reacted towards the Holocaust. Hanna (Kate Winslet) was a member of the older generation, while Michael (David Kross/Ralph Fiennes) was from the generation of German children who were born towards the end of the war. While Michael was raised to abhor the atrocities of the Holocaust, and blame their elders for not stopping it in time, Hanna and other non-Jewish Germans did not realize they were doing something wrong. The characters of the movie are really great in showing that we truly are just a product of our environment.<br /><br />The movie is good otherwise as well. The acting is well done, and I especially like seeing the character Michael mature. I also loved Hanna's quote during her trial, referring to her position as a Nazi guard: \\"What would you have done?\\" It's not to say that I dismiss what the Nazi guards did--clearly, they made bad decisions that contributed to one of the worst tragedies in history--but it just makes you realize that people may do certain bad actions because of their circumstances.<br /><br />I know a lot of people criticized this movie because of the illicit affair between a teenage boy and a woman in her 30s. While I don't approve of people who do that in real life, you have to realize that it's just a movie. These kinds of relationships do unfortunately occur once in a while, and if you're too uncomfortable to watch a movie that deals with it, you shouldn't see this movie.<br /><br />The movie may not be perfect, but it is certainly thought-provoking and worth watching at least once.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|after seeing the movie, I appreciate the game that much more... nice improvements to physics and background graphics... keep yo the good work Rovio!
B001E45XT4|5.0|So far I'm loving them. I ordered these May 11 and arrived May 12. That's awesome shipping for you. The package was easy to open and setting it up was as easy as plugging in two plugs.<br /><br />I love them. Great price. Great build. The only downer is the bass isn't as hard as my Skullcandy in-ears.<br /><br />These will do for now.
B000059TEQ|5.0|This is a classic \\"love story\\" and a must-see! The DVD arrived in great condition and at a great price! Highly recommended!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|This is the first time I have written a review for a CD that I have bought. I am doing it becuase I think Joe Bonamassa deserve all the praise he can get! I first heard Joe a couple of years ago on Deep Tracks on XM radio. I was so impressed that I bought many of his CDs. I have been listening to great guitarists for 40 years now and Joe is a great guitarist! I love that some of his solos are nice and long or that he may play two solos in the same song. I am a child of 60's and 70's rock and Joe is one of the few artist that didn't start his career back then who's CDs I have bought. He even has a great blues/rock voice. If you love great guitar playing you can't go wrong with Joe Bonamassa!
0385342047|4.0|The book came in great shape, and promptly.  I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books, and I am looking forward to any more (esp. regarding the shopaholic series.)
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Do not see update that came out today. Overall great game though. Update was supposed to be out today. . .
0439023521|4.0|I am an adult and read this since many of the smaller folk are entranced by it. Also, I've read many thousands of other books including quite a few in the YA category. This is very good and after about 50 pages the story moves along just fine.   This hits many of the YA themes pretty well. Katniss (named after the arrowroot plant that grows wild here in Connecticut where the author lives) is alienated, perplexed by the world, her \\"real\\" life is spent with another outsider in the woods, her mom is mostly useless, her dad is dead and she feels responsible for her kid sister. And she is just starting to notice that she may soon be that most dreaded thing- an adult.  The story is told almost exclusively from Katniss's point of view and there might be thirty words of dialogue in the middle 150 pages- so the movie will have to have a lot of interior monologue. If this was say a Jonathan Franzen novel there would be lots of detail about how folks speak, move, interact, remember and that sort of thing. But Katniss is 16 and doesn't see any of this nuance. Her story is one of how to survive in an arbitrary world that is out to get her- how many teens see the world.   And as with many other fantasy books one has to suspend some disbelief. It is probably the case that a number of the inconsistencies are probably there to set up the story lines of the next two volumes.  Overall this is not quite up to the high standards of the best of Scott O'Dell, J. K, Rowling or Kate DiCamillo but they set a pretty high bar.
0446195529|2.0|I am a huge fan of this man's novels but this one basically bored me stupid.  I finally reached the point where I didn't care what happened in the story and threw the book away!    Honestly, I had really wanted to like this but just found the story going round and round in circles, leading me down paths that ultimately went no-where and which brought me back to where I had started.  Kind of like analyzing something closely from 10 different angles but then finding out after each analysis that it was was flawed so you have to start over.  After a while I decided like I'd been cheated, having invested brain power in absorobing what I thought was the \\"information\\" relevant to the plot, only to be told \\"no, sorry it wasn't and you wasted your time\\".  After the umpteenth irrelevant trail he'd led this reader down I finally decided enough was enough and gave up.    Maybe this approach will greatly interest you, but I think he's capable of way better books and far more interesting plots.      By the way. this review has absolutely nothing to do with the price.  I bought mine used for a few bucks but even if I'd paid more, I bet the story would have still been the same inside the cover.
0670022411|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book. It was an adult mixture of The Twilight Saga, Harry Potter, and from the reports of future books a touch of the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. I flew through the book and can't wait for the others.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Its a older movie but it is one of my best movies ever it has DTS audio 5.1 D which makes the sound very good you should buy this movie.
B003L0V758|5.0|Janelle Monae is simply incredible in not only her talent in singing and entertaining but in basically having an entire story within two albums. Love her music, I appreciate the Lyrics, and her style is different but AMAZING! =)
B002NPUCIA|5.0|I waited some months to review this album/dvd by Brian Culbertson after i purchased it. I already had another one by him. I found that studio album light to listen to, good musicianship, fun but my appreciation of that one was limited to a couple of listening sessions. So I decided to think twice before reviewing this one, even if at first it conquered me. I thought \\"well it's smooth jazz in a couple of times I will get bored by this\\", ... well I started listeninig this one several times, and then I found myself coming back to it, more and more. After many weeks I have to say what I think about this one by Brian. It's fantastic. Nothing more (or less) that this. Great music. Isn't this what we are about? Good music that nurtre our souls and spirits, that make us laugh, have fun, move, tap our feet, clap our hands and move our  minds. This music belongs to that noble category. The good music one. I don't even want to talk about styles, genres here, defending this stuff against some music snobs that will say \\"this is elevator man\\" ,... because you know, smooth jazz has this elevator music bad fame that really makes no justice of albums of this caliber. It is really good music, very well conceived, written, and executed. And that's it dudes. And more that anything else, it is FUN! And this is what I'm after in music. Fun, if it's Bird and Diz it's fun, if it's Dave Pell and West Coast Jazz it's fun, if it's Van Halen it's fun, if it's Ted Nugent it's fun, if it's George Benson it's fun, if it's Buddy Rich it's fun, Robben Ford, it's all fun for me, this music is fun. This is what I like. Very well written and played music that makes me love my understanding of music and all the good things in my life that I do with a soundtrack (almost everything)! The cast of this recordings is made by stars of the smooth jazz heaven, Dave Kotz, Eric Marienthal, Brian (trombone, piano and bass!!!) and so on. So the quality is guaranteed! The tunes flow beautifully, there are not weak spots here, you will arrive at the end of the cd or dvd with the desire to listen to it again. This is what happens to me with this album. Extremely important point: the quality of the recording is SUPERB!!!! I'm an audiophile, I can tell you, this is a reference recording in every sense believe me. It's fabolous, the clarity, space, details, tones, dynamic of the recording are stellar! So in the end you have a groovin', funny, interesting, challenging, entertaining music recorded at state of the art level! What can you ask more than this (plus a very enjoyable dvd of the same music recorded in the studio)? Ok, I'd like to have a better cat in the guitar chair, you know, I'm a guitarist, and so probably I'd like to have Robben Ford or even in my wet dreams, George Benson here ; ))) but hey, nothing's perfect in this world. I have to tell you that I literally ADORE the idea of recording live music in the studio. Lee Ritenour did another studio live dvd and that one is great too. This one is more entertaining, Rit's more various in styles and musical situations, this is superior in terms of fun for me,  but generally speaking  I love the concept. For real. I can say, oneslty, with all my music knowledge (which is not poor believe me) that this album will entertain you for many years, giving you fun and enjoyment (especially now that summer is coming!!) ; )). It is good music, let the snobs go to the elevator to listen to their pure stuff. I ADORE this album!spots here, you will arrive at the end of the cd or dvd with the desire to listen to it again.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've owned this dvd for 2 years now but put it away after one try.  It's just too hard for the absolute beginner.  In January this year I decided to get healthy.  I'm going to be 40 next year and feel like it's now or never!  Anyway, I started jogging on the treadmill and doing push ups.  After 2 months and only a 1 pound weight loss I figured it was time to add in some strength exercise and watch my diet.  So, I started the 30 day Shred.  Like most of the reviewers, I thought I was going to die on day 1!  I mean how can I jog for 30 minutes and only break into a light sweat and then do this dvd and want to collapse after 5 minutes?  Holy *&%$ does she work you hard!  Luckily I only experienced some mild soreness the next day which I think is due to the previous 2 months of exercise.  I did 10 days of level one and today I started level 2.  I was apprehensive about this as everyone states how hard it is.  My experience with it is that while it is tough, it was not as hard as day one of level one.  I was dripping in sweat (as usual with this dvd) but I felt energized after finishing it.  The plank exercises are easier for me than doing deltoid work.  I guess my core is pretty strong---if only it wasn't covered in flab! :D  I do an additional hour of cardio (zumba/bike/dance)---something fun and am watching my diet.  I'll check my measurements and weight after I finish the 30 days and will hopefully see some improvement.  I have noticed that one of my too tight to button at the bust shirts can now be buttoned with room to spare!

1439107955|5.0|There are some important limitations of this book, but first my thoughts on why it is so good, and who is the targeted reader.    There are a number of chronological threads comprising the book, each looks at a particular problem in devising an effective treatment. These threads have real patients to be treated and one does get real feeling for them. They are not just props. However the meat of the book is in the scientific work needed to better understand the nature of the cancer as well as the chemotherapy regimens which could make use of that understanding. So the reader should be one of an inquisitive mind who has true interest in science and medicine. Other readers can skip it.    The biggest plus for me was the consistent effort by the author to keep the science limited to what is important and then making every effort to ensure that the reader understands clearly. One sees that the author doesn't want to write, he wants to communicate. And I found myself engrossed in the stories being told along with understanding what had not been clear to me previously. Furthermore, the research is being undertaken by real people whose situations we come to learn about and appreciate.    On the limitation side, I don't think this qualifies as a broad \\"biography of cancer\\". The focus is completely on finding treatments and cures, nothing on prevention. The treatments are all in the chemotherapy realm except for one excellent part on the surgery that has been used for breast cancer. Almost nothing on the radiation side or surgeries for other cancers. There is one brief but good excursion into understanding how lung cancer develops. As far as the chemotherapy, it is almost all related to cancer of the blood (leukemia) or breast cancer. But if one has particular interest in prostate cancer or colon cancer or bladder cancer or numerous other common cancers one might be disappointed by this book.    But this is an excellent book on the subjects that the author undoubtedly knows best. One shouldn't fault a book for what wasn't included, I don't think. And of course different cancers do have much in common.
0439023513|4.0|This is a page-turner, no doubt about it.  The climax of this series is compelling, and I'm sure that most readers--like me---lost sleep staying up late to finish it. This series is just built on an amazingly strong story concept. That said, the \\"ever after\\" ending seemed a bit pat---that was the only part that I didn't love.  Overall, the series' strength is its world-building, which ties into today's political debates.    This can be read and enjoyed by anyone who loves gripping fantasy and dystopias.  But I can see why it appeals particularly to those who fear and dislike the federal government in the U.S. (for example, Tea Party supporters): it feeds into their fears about the evils of a remote federal government in the most extreme fashion, and the shout out to the U.S. (for example, that there are 13 Districts) is often pretty clear.  But like any strong story, it can be read, interpreted differently, and enjoyed by almost anyone.

B004ZP37ZQ|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!(if u haven't already seen it) Cass quickly found his way into my heart in the 5th season and has been there ever since, but the fact that his intentions and motives are extremely questionable in this episode discourages me. I love all the supernatural episodes, regardless of how off they may seem to some, but Cass possibly being the bad guy struck a nerve. I hope he gets his act together before the Winchesters take him out.

B004NSULHM|4.0|I was profoundly disappointed with my first listen.  I didn't expect OK Computer, but maybe something closer to In Rainbows than Amnesiac.  However, as a whole, the mood this album creates is addictive....similar to Meddle from Pink Floyd.  I'm an old fool from the old school, but Radiohead continues to amaze me.
0307454541|5.0|I'm just starting this book. I accidentally read the 2nd in the series first, and liked it, so I'm looking forward to reading this one and getting more background on a few of the characters and story lines.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This is an excellent microphone for interviews or documentaries.  The cord is very long and is very easy to get to your subject.  There was only one downfall, which I knew about before shooting and was able to fix it.  This mic is mono (meaning it only records in the left)  and if you plan on using the Mic for filming you'll need to pick up a mono to stereo converter to make it easy on yourself.

B004RC8NUQ|5.0|This is the perfect girl movie! Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher are so good together, they could be a real life couple. I think a lot of people would see the cover and chalk this one up to a silly romantic comedy, but I thought the acting was great...especially Ashton. When Natalie pushed back (the whole premise of the movie is that she wants to just be \\"sex friends\\" but he wants more), he really looked like he was being patient with her as any guy head over heels for a girl would be. The scenes with his friends were funny too. And what girl doesn't eat donuts like a wild woman after getting the cold shoulder from a guy? Natalie's character did, and it was a great scene. It definitely evoked some emotion too if you've ever been in that situation. No Strings Attached is definitely worth renting, if not buying.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|If you are on the fence on this item buy it!    Pros:  This item is very comfortable. Sometimes when I am not using it I will just rest my hand on it rather than on my keyboard.  The joystick is excellently placed and works great for wasd movement.  It is amazingly easy to program, took me about 10-15 minutes to setup after instillation..  It can save 4 profiles for each game, not just 4 total.  It has a nice weight to it and is very sturdy.    Cons:  Cant think of any.    Other:  The 3 lowest keys (G20-22) and the 2 widest keys (G1,G7) are not the most comfortable to reach when playing, but they don't hurt anything, and can be used for toggles.  CPU and RAM Performance monitor reminded me I need to upgrade my PC.

B000I2J2WM|1.0|I ordered new copies of this dvd from two vendors. I have five dvd players, Neither of these dvd's would load on any of the players. When I explained the problem to an electronics store representative, I was told that HD was an old format & would not play on newer dvd players. If true, this should have been explained in the listing. I returned the first one at my expense, which resulted in a refund so little that it wasn't worth the effort. The remaining one, I'll just trash.

B001QXCYZY|5.0|The microphone works well.  I plugged it in and it worked immediately (XP Pro).  The volume is fine, the quality is excellent, the DC bias in nil, etc.  The problem is that when it's recording, it shocks me!  I noticed that when I touch it in some places, there's tons of noise, like when I touch a plug for a speaker system.  Apparently, on mine, the mesh over the microphone is connected to the power or something because it shocked my wife's lip when she got too close, and my finger when I licked it and touched the mesh!  I hope this isn't the normal situation for this mic, and that it's just a problem with my particular unit, but I think I'm going to try to return the unit.<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />I traced the problem to a faulty ground.  We just moved into my house and the ground wire from the wall (being shared with the computer, and the usb functions) were not actually grounded.  After grounding, everything works perfectly.  GROUND YOUR MIC!<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />You're right, the mic has since proven (got it around May 13, 2011 and now it's June 20, 2012) to be excellent.  It has served my needs (home voice (only) recording) very well, and withstood my child going from 2 to 3 years. Thanks for the reminder.
B000KUD2G4|4.0|The HD400 eliminated the hum in my powered studio monitor speakers.   I tested the frequency response and found that it has no effect on the line level signal between 40hz and 20khz - other than a slight (2dB) drop in signal level.  Below 40hz, it  introduces a little ringing (which I can live with).
B004XJHBCE|5.0|FolderOrganizer IS counterintuitive.  It IS difficult to learn.  I DO love it!    I want more icons on my home scree than than I could fit on 3 homescreens!  Ribbon launchers don't help.  They make the problem worse as I tug on the ribbon looking for the app I want.  FolderOrganizer lets me arrange things in a way that feels natural to me by letting me place icons in folders!  I've got a News folder, a Weather folder, an Android folder, a Devices folder, and an Internet folder all on my home page, with each folder containing more than a half-dozen icons on average.  (My Games and Maps folders are on the page to the left of Home.)    It took me a bit of time to figure out how to create a new folder, but after enough repetitions the process is ingrained in muscle memory.  There is a FolderOrganizer website that you can find through Google to help.    If you keep collections of program and file icons in folders on your PC's desktop, you'll love FolderOrganizer for your Android phone.

B004PGO25O|4.0|I found this book to be very similar to watching a motivational speaker. You may not agree with every detail that they espouse but something about the tone, passion and underlying concepts really want to make you get up and DO SOMETHING. And so in that regard, I found it to be a very effective tool for inspiring action.    I also greatly appreciate that even the author himself allows space for disagreement while still pushing the reader to take action. On page 394 (Kindle edition) he writes, \\"Stay stupid. Follow your unconventional, crazy heart. If your notion violates every precept I've set forth in these pages, tell me to go to hell. Do what that voice says.\\"    I recommend reading the book in sitting as it gives a stronger punch that way, much like listening to a motivational speech all in one sitting rather than interrupting it and continuing it the next day.    DISCLAIMER: I received a free copy of this book via [...]
B00007FOMP|5.0|Brilliance many times comes out of pain and a tortured soul, never more has this statement been true than when describing this artist and this wonderfully historic album.  WHAT'S GOING ON is the album Marvin had wanted to make for a very long time but was held back from making due the strictness of Motown's founder and president, Berry Gordy.  Marvin, who went through many trauma's as a child and young adult with an alcoholic & abusive father as well as a marriage that was beginning to fall apart, had a lot of emotions bottled up inside.<br /><br />He truly needed an outlet and wasn't being given the freedom to do so musically which is one of the reasons I believe he turned so heavily to drugs early on.  It was through a series of letters he received from his brother who was serving in Vietnam that this incredible album and it's overall message would come into being.  His brother was informing him about the war and what that all entailed and Marvin begin to tie that in with life here in the U.S. and what it was going to be like for his brother, or anyone in his situation, to return home.  And from that, WHAT'S GOING ON was conceived and born.<br /><br />It truly is a tortured soul, begging, no, SCREAMING for all to come together and put aside petty bigotry, hate and war.  But it's also, in many ways, a confessional for Marvin as, if you pay close attention, he is revealing many of the thoughts and struggles he's personally dealing with at the time.  It's Marvin's life struggles, the \\"microcosm\\" relaying the overall issues and struggles facing the nation and world as a whole, the \\"macrocosm.\\"  It's an album that really and truly needs to be listened to all at once as it truly was meant to be a continuous message and not a series of \\"singles.\\"<br /><br />We've heard of \\"concept\\" albums before but this was the truest since of that term as each song is a part of an overall story that Mr. Gaye takes us on.  With each note he sings, you can hear the plea in the man's voice calling out for both outward togetherness and inner peace.  He was actually contemplating leaving music behind altogether prior to the creation of this album.  However, his brothers stories plus his own personal demons, compelled him both to write & record this album as well as fight Gordy and the powers that be at Motown for it's promotion and release.  It's amazing to listen to Gordy now as he reflects back on what he told Marvin about the album then versus the conversations they had in the years after it's release and historical success.<br /><br />I may never have been as moved as when I first heard this album for the first time, the tears flowed, I danced, shouted, cried out and expressed just about every kind of emotion humanly possible.  I truly love this album and pray that this brilliant, loving, tortured soul has finally come to know the peace he agonized over and sang about to us on this record so long ago.  This is a quintessential album and EVERY music lover no matter what genre you may prefer should give it a listen.  I promise you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />There was never an album recorded like this one up to that point, it truly was/is one of a kind as was/is it's creator.  Marvin Gaye was a true musical giant and deeply profound man, his work is being reassessed more and more as it should be as some of the very best ever recorded.

0345522478|3.0|Our hero, Atticus O'Sullivan, is a 2000-year -old Druid currently living in Arizona. He has a sword that some of the Tuatha de Danann think he should return to them. He runs a New Age bookstore, and looks like he's in his early twenties.     Like most urban fantasies, this one has our hero talking in the first person, as a kind of running commentary on his life. It starts with a battle outside his bookstore, in which we learn of Atticus's powers, and something of the forces arrayed against him.     This book has a lot going for it. It is aptly named - he is being pursued relentlessly, his lawyer is a werewolf, he can shapeshift into a wolfhound, and his companion Irish Wolfhound, Oberon, is a distinctive, original character. The Irish pantheon is nicely drawn, and like Neil Gaimon's American Gods, they are not the only supernatural beings in this universe. There are gods from all over, and Coyote laughs when things do not go as Atticus might wish. There is a lot of action. There is even a reference to the SCA as a cover for talking about historical-sounding feuds.     But there are drawbacks, too. The narrative was not compelling. Everyone had motivations that read like D&D game (or current equivalent) - one layer deep. The action was too much telling, not showing. As the action got hotter, the narrator still talked in long complex sentences that slowed down the story. For instance, in the climactic battle, Atticus says, \\"You've hounded me for centuries. And you might have hounded me for many more, but your petty jealously of Brighid has brought you to this end!\\" The dialog is not bad, per se, but it does not read like something one would actually say in the midst of a sword fight. His words were not a taunt - they were a summation for the reader.    A story gains energy from the introduction of new characters. But the author constantly introduced new characters, each with a backstory, so there's constant exposition. Before the character is fully absorbed, then hisor her moment on the stage was over, and someone new shows up.     The story was eventually all tied up, with just enough loose ends to leave room for a sequel. I might even read it. The series has potential, and room for growth.

On the other hand it is also somewhat frustrating.<br /><br />The heroes of most fantasy authors are heroes that are beyond the pale when it comes to winning... they always seem to win, are always head and shoulders above all the bad guys.  Not so with Martin's heroes.  His good guys are flesh and blood and subject to all the foibles of human beings.  And that is where the frustration comes in, at least for me.  Mr. Martin's heroes are just too dang \\"weak.\\"  They get defeated too often, for example...<br /><br />**************************************************************************************************************************<br />SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOLIER<br /><br />Ned Stark getting beheaded by that cowardly little scum Joffrey Bratheon<br />************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />I do not understand why something like that was necessary to move the story along but what the heck, it is not my story; nonetheless I do not have to like it.

0143038419|4.0|I liked it enough to write a review, but don't quite know why it's been such a sensation. The movie didn't capture it, however, so if you liked the movie you'll enjoy the book much more. I found that the story wandered and then focused too much on places/people that seemed out of context with the author's personality. Given the subject of the book--self exploration and renewal--perhaps that's the point and I didn't entirely take it in, but the parts that fit for me got the point across and the ones that didn't fit took away from it. At any rate, enjoy because it's a completely original and refreshing story that is a pleasure to receive as a gift from someone who was generous in sharing her experience and baring her soul.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|Since there are hundreds of long winded reviews, I will split from the pack and justify the three points in my title. *spoiler alert!*    This movie would have been better if there was more concentration on Matt Damon's character and what lead him to unhappy life, inability to have a relationships... instead of just constantly referring to it.  They go into insanely boring minutia on the woman's and boy's life, but not of the other main character?      I feel that if they had less info on the other book she was going to write and various scenes demonstrating her distraction (we get it already) and more on maybe her relationship with that guy (who was he to her really?) and how they were close (were they) and then disconnected after her experience, then that would have been more meaningful.    With the boy - a little less about the situation with social workers and adjusting to a foster home and maybe a more satisfying reconnect with the brother during his reading would have been more satisfying.  Because it seemed to drone on forever before getting to the point.  The person I was watching the movie with about an hour into it asked \\"What is this thing about?\\".  That is a bad sign.    You just flit from place to place - scene to scene  - never really delving into the true feelings of the characters.  And the end - the climax - well it needed movie viagra.  You will say - \\"That's it?\\".  Ho hum.

B0049GYXDG|4.0|Alice in Wonderland (animation, fantasy, family, musical)<br />Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske<br />Starring the voices of Kathryn Beaumont, Ed Wynn, Richard Haydn, Sterling Holloway<br /><br />Disney / Buena Vista   1951   75 min   Rated G   Released Feb 01, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.32:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />French: DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy<br /><br />Celebrating its 60th anniversary, Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland looks perfect on Blu-ray. The movie was nominated for one Oscar (best score) and contains a number of songs, as well as having a strong musical presence throughout.<br /><br />Watching a classic Disney title is like stepping back in time. Compared to modern animation, the classics contain more warmth and less peril. There's also considerably less action. The stories are full of wonder and revel in showing the viewer the setting. One common theme running through all of the titles is the friendly nature of animals and inanimate objects.<br /><br />In Alice in Wonderland, all of the animals talk. You'll also hear from flowers and a door knob. It's a strange fantasy world inhabited by weird creatures. The adventure begins when Alice follows a white rabbit down a hole. She stumbles across such creatures as oysters, a walrus, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat and an army of somewhat threatening playing cards.<br /><br />Alice can change size by eating things in Wonderland. This can be helpful, but regularly causes her problems. Nothing is logical because it's the stuff of dreams. Most of the creatures are friendly and well-meaning, but there are a few moments of danger when Alice encounters the Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />The movie has a few too many songs for my particular taste, although it works perfectly as a family film. It's not hard to see why the movie has enchanted children for the past 60 years as there's always something interesting happening. For adults watching it alone, it won't appeal to everyone in the way that perhaps a Pixar movie would. This is mainly aimed at children.<br /><br />I found myself recognizing some of the voices. The Cheshire Cat was voiced by Sterling Holloway who also played Winnie the Pooh and Kaa the Snake in The Jungle Book. Kathryn Beaumont, who is still alive, voiced Wendy Darling in Peter Pan.<br /><br />While the movie is a lot of fun, it lacks the heart and innocence of other early Disney classics such as Bambi or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. That said, it deserves a place in your library if you have young children. The colors, songs, memorable creatures and fast pace will hold the attention of most children.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />Quite simply, the transfer couldn't be better. The colors are bright and the image is clean. It looks like the characters were drawn yesterday. The only thing that makes the movie look dated is the style of the animation. It's a lot flatter and lacks the three-dimensional appearance of modern Disney movies such as Bolt or the Pixar titles. Nobody will be disappointed with the appearance of this 60th anniversary Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />There are two English audio tracks included, along with French and Spanish tracks. One English track is a restored stereo version of the original soundtrack. My preferred version is the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix. Everything is clear, but the track is front-heavy. You will hear something from your rears, but it won't match more recent releases. However, this is another fine upgrade over previous releases.<br /><br />Special Features 5/5<br /><br />There are over four hours of additional features, the best of which is the 76-minute Through the Keyhole: A Companion's Guide toWonderland feature.<br /><br />Deleted Materials includes 21 minutes of footage that didn't make it into the film.<br /><br />The remaining features include a song, an interactive game, TV specials and reflections on the film.<br /><br />The Alice in Wonderland Blu-ray offers a huge jump in quality over previous releases of the film. Disney hasn't disappointed me yet. Also included is a DVD version. It's not the best of the classic Disney titles, but is worthy of being in any collection.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5 (for its intended audience)nd reflections on the film.    The Alice in Wonderland Blu-ray offers a huge jump in quality over previous releases of the film. Disney hasn't disappointed me yet. Also included is a DVD version.

6302787068|5.0|Great movie, i prefer the VHS since they ruin disney movies for me when they change the movies for the dvd release. i would prefer if they stayed true to the original selling version when they put movies on dvd, or re-create the whole movie for dvd distrabution.      Loved this movie as a child, and still like this the VHS version, and still own all 3 VHS titles for this series. i highly reccomend this movie, if you want the dvd they only changed the song ''A Whole New World'' to a new recording(at the time of course) by different singers. Also i reccomend with this movie getting the other two disney aladdin movies(there are some other variations by other companies of this movie) which are also not bad), and also the tv show that went along with these was pretty good.

B0013ND30M|4.0|Disney considered this to be his magnum opus trying to expand on the merits of previous films later admitting this to be very flawed for something that was to be considered Disney's greatest. Firstly conflicting interests in more ambitious more publicity driven endeavors through the space race with Russia and the endeavors through Disneyland make them invest only so much in this production. What they do invest essentially does not flesh out the whole film it is uneven and choppy due to conflicting artistic interests. Firstly they want a naive sixteen year old princess but the angular style reminiscent of UPA and Warner Bros. in order to stylistically change their direction. The stylistic change prohibits such a design of a juvenile naive sixteen year old virgin, as she looks more mature and aware and developed than this. Because Walt wanted both he essentially sacrifices and endurable princess character for a style that differs from past Disney endeavors which although distinct character development suffers. Again she is developed to a completely different direction and is not sympathetic because her awareness makes it seem that all of her hardships she brings upon herself.     Further more another problem with this project is that the only really well fleshed out character is Eleanor Audley's Maleficent. The voice delivery for her is perfect and is an exceptional expansion on what made the Snow White Queen so endurable. However this film becomes more of a character study and vehicle for her and is told from her perspective so I laugh at the idea that they are trying to make a new spin on Sleeping Beauty with Tim Burton when this concept was essentially executed in the original. They neglect to flesh out the other characters which makes this film depressing seeing her as the only compelling character. The only reason you empathize with the cast is because you share a common enemy in Maleficent she is malevolence taken to its extremes in a fictional sense. She seemsto intimidate and scare people through her firmness and seductive appearance initially as she is to frail to look as if she is any physical threat. Though when it comes to character study as we notice as the film progresses she becomes more erratic her physical appearance deteriorates in the sixteen years she searches for Aurora. Character Study is so effective for her exclusively that she is the only one who really progresses throughout the film.    Aurora herself has to many mature physical features to convey herself as a naive sixteen year old virgin she is reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn which Marc Davis derived much of his influence for Aurora from as this was stated before. The whole Sixteen Year old concept was used in much greater effect with Snow White but probably at its zenith with Glen Keane's Aeriel in The Little Mermaid. The two female leads seem to be based on Hollywood Personalities but in a renaissance historical context as artistically much of the visuals are based. They are so focused on technical proficiency in this film namely to exploit the new technology of Technarama and with Eyvind Earle they took great advantage of the technology through intricate surroundings and atmosphere with some influence of minimalism as well.     The reason why this is not Disney's zenith is first off I could cite better character development in other films perhaps with the exception of a more compelling villain, Chernonbog's appearance in scale and might could be debatable. So really had this been greater it would have had the same effect that Snow White or other Disney classics did in the sense that it brings back interest in theatrical animation when the industry was transitioning to television. It did not such thing as many of the laid-off artists found their way to Hanna Barabera who many of the big suits at Disney ironically didn't consider them much competition, yet some of the most proficient artists in this film found their way there shortly after.     This was probably Walt's wake up call the man who was synonymous with fiscal irresponsibility with Roy keeping him in line finally conceded that Roy was right. It was a good run but following this they cease producing epics arguably until the renaissance. Overall this film has just as great use of perspective and scale and versatile use of color keys. Though visual beauty does not prevent under-developed characters. Which again the biggest pro in this film is its distinct visual style.

B000065VB0|5.0|The initial untitled albums were an expansion on Peter's post-modernism conveyed in The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. However understanding that he wanted to explore different directions he left Genesis to built a reputation on his own. His goal to explore new musical territories is somehow reached in this album where not only does he come into his own element he shows us how versatile he is. From social advocacy in Biko where he starts to incorporate World Music influence for the first time. Much of the hard rock influence in his earlier solo albums seems to reach more depth and pessimism but in a truly sincere and genuine way. Intruder, No Self Control, and Not One of Us deal with identity issues and sense of wanting to materialize into something else and somehow has a correlation to Peter trying to find himself and finally coming into his own.     The album is quite eclectic borrowing from new wave, world music, hard rock which was established in previous albums. The atmosphere is to die for, and he takes on multiple persona's to a much greater effect than when he was dressing up in Genesis performances. Again this album is all the proof you need to show that Peter needed to leave Genesis to artistically grow into this. Which benefited Genesis because they became more lucrative under Phil Collins that however doesn't mean they were as artistically inclined as this album.
B004G6009K|5.0|A surprisingly good movie from the non-Pixar side of Disney animation.  An excellent film for everyone--I watched it with my 50+ year old parents and several kids as well, and if was loved by all.
0670022411|5.0|Harry Potter fans, Twilight fans, Sookie fans, this book is for you!!!!   I've been waiting for the next best series and this is it!  Although it will only be a trilogy , I'll take it!   It is beautifully written, and there were no slow parts at all for me!  The build up during the last few chapters fit in the storyline perfectfully and was a great build up for the next book!!!  I didn't want it to end, and as soon as I finished it, I started it again!  Thank you Deborah Harkness!  It will be a long long wait for the next one for me!

0891419063|5.0|This book is a highly commendable account of intense warfare. To his credit Eugene Sledge demonstrated noteworthy diplomacy on many subjects where there are mixed opinions. This was particularly evident when he cited historians perspectives on some of the more debatable objectives of the Pacific Theater of War, such as taking Peleliu. Sledge also provides excellent insight into how morality can be skewed by heavy combat. I found him to be a respectful narrator, which no doubt was constructed by a fine upbringing and good education. It is imperative for all of us to remember that the sacrifice American military personnel made in the Pacific, was greater than any other country. This phenomenal effort was well told by Sledge, and his memoir is an honourable record of his personal experience, and that of his many comrades who gave their lives for the protection of freedom.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

B0039TD7PY|3.0|Both artists are good, but they do their old singles and I guess I was looking for more King and Taylor together.  Good but rehash of a lot of what they have already done.
0756404738|4.0|This is a book that I found to be a slow read.  I was actually suprised at how long it took the story to move out the university setting and get Kvothe on the road and to start making his reputation outside the university.  The book comes across as a series of linked short stories. They are obviously important to Kovothe's history as described in book one [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]] and this is the book where he finally grows up but I felt a lot of the tension that was felt between the past the future Kvothe was lacking in this book and the author built little sense of urgency into the story.    This is very much a middle book in a series.  Building blocks are put in place for the wrap up in book three but little is truly resolved here and as a result it's a somewhat disappointing read.  I really didn't know if I should give this book three or four stars, but every time I started to get frustrated with the story I found myself admiring the writing and how vividly Rothfuss has evoked by Kvothe and his world.  I'm expecting a lot to happen in book three of the series as the title of the series alone tells you Kvothe's story is far from over and we all know it can't end well....
0300169787|5.0|It's so perfect .. So gorgeous ... It's inspiring from start to finish ... as when you read a beautyfull novel, every detail, every picture, every word transports you to another dimention ... He really was a talented man .. like him, none ...
B00005JKGK|5.0|I cannot watch this movie too often - I wake up with puffy eyes the next morning.  This movie is about all women.  I'm lucky because I have (still) the most wonderful, intelligent, beautiful and giving mother in the world.  Although she came from Mexico and the mothers in this movie came from China, their experiences were similar.  The mother/daughter relationship IS the most beautiful and complex in the world.  Watching this movie reminds me ... I thank God every day for my mother & I hope she's proud of me. Mami! Are you listening?  Your baby thinks and knows you are the greatest.  You really are.

0307477479|2.0|I bought this book on Amazon, after I read it had won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Literature. I read through half the book, with great effort on my part to \\"like it,\\" and finally had to give it up. What is the author trying to say? Who are these characters? Why is this considered excellent literature? At least last year's winner \\"Tinker\\" was very well written, even if the story did not appeal to a reader.
0887307280|3.0|I did not really learn anything, but just obtained a different perspective on his take on what is required to succeed in building a business. He said a few interesting and though-provoking things, which allows me to cautiously recommend. I did not like the writing style in this book; his paragraphs did not flow and I found the book hard to read. I read it in 2 sittings, so it was not a long book.

1587613379|5.0|I got this book because of a recommendation of poly friend of mine when I developed romantic feelings for a mutual friend who was also poly. I had talked to their relationships in the past, and I didn't have anything wrong with the way they lived their lives, but the idea of it being the way I lived my life too scared me a lot. Would I get jealous? Will someone else hate me? Will there be whispers behind my back in my friend group? It just seemed too overwhelming.    This book was one of those where, as I read it, I realized I already had this world view, I'd just never articulated it. Men and women *should* be treated as equals, honesty and caring about your lovers' feelings are more important than monogamy, and of course it's possible to love more than one person at once. I laughed out loud a few times, just because I already knew this, but I was comparing my own opinions to our \\"cultural norms\\" that say the opposite. I never thought to question the cultural norms, instead I spent all these years questioning my own feelings.    I also think it's a book that everyone should read. Especially in the first few chapters, there is advice about dating that I have given to my single friends. The chapter about learning to be single is also very touching, and I think it's an important lesson for everyone to learn. I know that some people who need it will end up missing this advice because of who it's targeted to; I just hope they have friends who've read this book.

B00000I9MK|5.0|I've had a complex relationship with TIGERMILK, the debut album of Belle and Sebastian. Growing up in the 1990s and early millennium, I had heard of Belle and Sebastian as a major force in indie rock and had often admired their distinctive cover art while flipping through record store stacks, but only a few months ago did I start listening. I was initially turned off a bit by the childish world of the lyrics -- I could certainly understand why the band's style was referred to \\"twee rock\\" by a sceptical portion of the musical press. Belle and Sebastian frontman Stuart Murdoch was nearly 30 years old when TIGERMILK was recorded, but his lyrics are very often centered around school and the travails of being a teenager.<br /><br />But, TIGERMILK eventually won me over completely. On closer examination, the lyrics hint at darker currents and are not mere childhood nostaglia. The pop hooks are irrestible, but Murdoch's logorrhea delivery makes each song a meaty story and nothing is mere fluff. Touches of trumpet and careful production enrich the DIY feel of guitars and drums. Another strong point of TIGERMILK is that it was originally a lark for the band members (only 1000 copies were initially pressed) and the album includes a few pleasant facets that might have been smoothed over by a producer too focused on creating the perfect product. The keyboard-heavy \\"Electronic Renaissance\\" doesn't jive with everything else, but it's enjoyable and its presence confers an air of authenticity.<br /><br />As spring has finally come to my corner of the world, TIGERMILK is a record I can't get enough of. I look forward to exploring the rest of Belle and Sebastian's output.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I'm only giving it a  4 because the game itself is AWESOME!!!!!!  I have been checking since May 1st for the update and was excited that it was here. It was not clear on how to install it. I had to read a review from someone else here to get it to work. Thats ridiculous. It worked thank goodness. I have a droid htc and I opened the amazon app, hit menu, my apps, update available. It worked yeah..!!!!!!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|My sister and I lucked into the movie many years ago when the show we went to see was a disappointment.  We snuck into Watership Down and fell in love.  Immediately went out and bought the book.  Have read in several times over the year.  Pity the people that read a book only once.  This one deserves to be read again and again.  I just bought it for Kindle for my kids to read.  One of the reasons they have a Kindle.
B004LL1HM4|4.0|It took nearly three years for the indie folk collective Fleet Foxes to release a follow up to their self titled debut, and I'll admit that I had my reservations about their newest release.  For starters, 2008's \\"Fleet Foxes\\" was (in my opinion) the best album released that year and boasted incredible songs such as \\"White Winter Hymnal\\", \\"Ragged Wood\\", \\"He Doesn't Know Why\\" and \\"Oliver James\\".  These songs as well as the rest of the album set the bar incredibly high not only for their indie peers, but for themselves as well.  Expectations were going to be sky high for the follow up.  Then I began to hear some of the new tracks on Sirius/XM radio.  \\"Helplessness Blues\\" and \\"Grown Ocean\\" were solid cuts, but they didn't blow me away as did the best songs from their debut effort.  I braced myself for a letdown--yet another indie band that stormed onto the scene only to fizzle out.<br /><br />Yet Helplessness Blues is anything but a disappointment.  If the record lacks a true, killer stand alone single, that's because the songs work better in the context of the album.  Robin Pecknold and his bandmates have set out to create an album in the truest sense of the word.  The songs fit together nicely to form a fully realized artistic vision.  The melodies are delicate and unfurl slowly while Pecknold's angelic vocals deliver lyrics with an unmistakable spiritual and cosmic quality to them.  Meanwhile, the vocal harmonies give the songs an added layer of beauty and intricacy.<br /><br />Helplessness Blues may not sound like a huge step forward from a band shouldering the burden of huge expectations, but it's not a step backwards either.  Instead it is the work of a young group that is continuing to perfect its craft and establish its place in the indie folk scene.  For now, that will do just fine.
B000000OUJ|5.0|I STILL LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM TO THIS DAY...LIQUID SWORDS IS ONE THE GREATEST LYRICAL ALBUMS THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE! I MISS THE DAYS WHEN HIP HOP WAS ABOUT LYRICS AND RHYMES, I HATE THIS BS THEY GOT OUT NOW..IF U DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM IN YOUR COLLECTION, YOU NEED TO GRAB IT!
B003ITDN86|3.0|Sometimes it's just time to pack it in. The worst part about it is I didn't listen to the whole album.(I know I'm going to take some heat for that) But, what I heard was not impressive. I actually enjoyed their previous albums, but it seems it's time to just stop already. They lost an original member of their band and I don't feel their as tight. I know the lead singer went through a touch divorce and it shows. Stop already!
B004G6009U|5.0|I purchased this gift a few weeks before Easter to add to the Easter basket for my 5 year old daughter. She had already seen this movie and it is one of the few movies that she will actually sit and watch from beginning to end and then ask to watch it over and over again. This is also a great movie for boys as well. She has a lot of play dates with little boys from her class and usually they are not interested in watching any of her movies because they say they are \\"too girlie\\" but this has just the right amount of action as well and \\"girlie\\" things in it too keep both boys and girls entertained.   I especially love the fact that I payed almost 10 dollars less than the local stores as well as other online sites that I checked before I bought it on Amazon.com. The greatest part is that we now have the actually movie for the house and one to use in our vehicle and don't have to constantly take one single copy back and forth; sometimes forgetting it in the house and listening to her fuss in the car that she doesn't like any of the movies in the car...or the other way around --- we leave the movie in the car and then when she wants to watch it in the house we have to get it out of the car (total nuisance).    GREAT MOVIE...GREAT PRICE!!!!

B003KGBIRK|4.0|David Cronenberg's \\"Videodrome\\" has become something of a cult classic since it was released in the 1982. Like many of Cronenberg's other films, \\"Videodrome\\" focuses on a virus of sorts that changes humanity--in this case, though, its not a modified rabis virus, or mutated form of VD (or even the \\"mind as virus\\" as in \\"Scanners\\")but, instead, on the media as virus altering us by altering our perception of reality.<br /><br />The Criterion Blu-ray is pulled from the same high definition source as the DVD released a couple of years back looks marvelous but newly transferred for Blu-ray. \\"Videdrome\\" was made at a time when film stocks were going through transition (and like many 80's films)looks a bit vibrant than we might expect a film made today to look. Criterion has done a superb job of creating the ultimate edition of this film. The film looks nearly flawless with no noticeable print damage, speckles evident in other DVD editions (except the Criterion of course) cleaned up. There's a nice, pleasing noticeable level of fine grain and I doubt the film has ever looked this good--including the original prints that ran when the movie was in theaters back in the day.<br /><br />The print is the version that Cronenberg submitted to the MPAA prior to additional trimming to bring the film in line to what the MPAA considered an \\"R\\" rated film. That's important because the MPAA insisted that one key sequence in the film be altered to gain its \\"R\\" rating along with a number of other minor trims.<br /><br />The audio soundtrack sounds extremely good with a 24 bit transfer. Dialogue is crisp and clear and Howard Shore's creepy sythesizer based score sounds marvelous here. It's a pity that the original sound elements didn't under go a 5.1 or stereo mix for this edition but what we do get sounds terrific.<br /><br /> We get two audio commentaries--the first features Cronenberg and his DP Mark Irwin discussing everything from the themes of the film and how the photography embodies them to technical challenges they faced in shooting the film. The second features actor Woods and Deborah Harry who played Renn's lover Nicki in the film. Woods is quite talkative providing considerable insight into his role in the film and what attracted him to working with Cronenberg.<br /><br />We also get the 2000 short film \\"Camera\\" which was produced to celebrate the anniversary of the Toronto Film Festival. It compliments \\"Videodrome\\" perfectly almost like an extension of some of the themes from the film. Running around 6 minutes the film was shot on video except for the very last shot.<br /><br />We also get a very good documentary \\"Forging the New Flesh\\" that examines \\"Videodrome\\" within the context of its time and its relevance today. There's also \\"Effects Men\\" an audio interview as well as the complete footage from the Samurai dream sequence.<br /><br />Rounting out the special features is the original promotional featurette, theatrical trailer, a roundtable discussion entitled \\"Fear on Film\\" from 1982 featuring Cronenberg as well as behind-the-scenes photos. As with all later Criterion releases we get a booklet with essays analyzing the film.<br /><br />While this is expensive compared to the regular DVD edition, the Criterion Collection edition of \\"Videodrome\\" has the film looking the best it ever has with a recent high definition cleaned up transfer as well as extension supplements on the making of the film. For those interested there follows a summary of the plot--<br /><br />Up and coming media mogul Max Renn (James Woods) is looking for the next big thing to attract an audience to his small cable TV station channel 83. He thinks he has found it with the odd almost hallucinagenic pirate TV program \\"Videodrome\\" where production values and story are jetisoned for raw, brutal torture and violence committed against the average person. What Renn uncovers though is a conspriacy to alter humanity as those who watch \\"Videodrome\\" begin to have waking halluncinations of a bizarre variety; TVs come to life becoming an extension of human beings; a gun grows into his hand becoming an extension of it; variations of the things he sees on \\"Videodrome\\" appear in Renn's world but only to him.<br /><br />Fans of the movie know the rest of the important plot points and discussing anything else would be major spoilers but if you've seen any of Cronenberg's other films you'll get a sense of the general direction of THIS film.<br /><br />Recommended.n of human beings; a gun grows into his hand becoming an extension of it; variations of the things he sees on \\"Videodrome\\" appear in Renn's world but only to him.     Fans of the movie know the rest of the important plot points and discussing anything else would be major spoilers but if you've seen any of Cronenberg's other films you'll get a sense of the general direction of THIS film.    Recommended.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I one hundred percent agree that everyone in the entire world should be watching Nikita! I started watching Vampire Diaries last summer and got completly hooked and so watching Diaries exposed me to this new show called Nikita. I missed the pilot the first time it aired, but then it came on again and I decided to watch and fell in love. Every time I think about how close I got to missing out, it makes me upset. Thursday nights are my new CW nights! This show is so amazing, let me put it into a perspective everyone can in someway understand. My Thursday Nights used to be devoted to Bones and the Office. I now watch them both the next day because Nikita and Diaries are so GOOD!! I pray that there is a season two next fall and I hope everyone will start watching this highly underrated, but overly awesome show!!! Lyndsy Fonseca, Maggie Q, and of course Shane West have a real gem on there hands! (I love Mikita!)  There is something for everyone and my whole family watches, and so should you!!!!!

B000FCKGPC|4.0|To all of you fans of Geogre RR, I thank you for your input to \\"A Feast for Crows\\". I will not read this book even though I enjoyed his first three. Having just recently discovered Mr Martin in the past three months, I have read the first three and have not had to wait and wait for him to write another. I agree with many that Mr Martin rambles on with no end in sight. He is a very gifted writer, yet I don't think even he knows where this story is going. Soon his book \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" will be available in July. I sincerely hope that Martin writes about the Danerys character and Tyrion and Jon Snow. They are the most interesting characters in his story. I am looking forward to a little bit of closure in this new novel. I believe that there will be as there are only two more books to write to finish his \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. I just have to wonder how long I will have to wait to be able to read them.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|It's one of those graphic films that you have to remind yourself from time to time during the course of watching it that it's only a movie and nothing more. And even that reassurance doesn't do quite enough to ease the overwhelming feelings of disgust and revulsion elicited by the torture scenes. Still, it is a fascinating story partially based on fact according to Eli Roth who's investigations led him down a path he ultimately had to abandon for his own safety. Decide for yourself whether it's the truth or a clever marketing ploy.

0545123283|1.0|YA reading doesn't bother me.  What does bother me is when you create young characters who have nothing important to say and are just whining and melodramatic.  The love story took a dump in this book.  I'd like to see one YA writer create characters that don't see their parents as people who don't \\"understand\\" where they're coming from or what the meaning of love is.  Come on.  Young readers who read that don't learn anything.  I love science fiction love and escaping from reality, but you need to have story to back it up.  Too many chapters were just whining... with no plot movement whatsoever.
0316069353|2.0|Way to much courtroom procedural stuff - does Connelly think his readers really don't know this stuff?  Looked like just a bunch of filler to me.  And the ending revelation with the balloons was just totally unbelievable.  Connelly can be amazingly good or amazingly bad and sorry to say, this book was the latter one.
0316056863|5.0|[[ASIN:0316056863 Bossypants]]  Maybe I was an obvious fan, something about Tina Fey has always been a hit with me. Her dry humor, every girl approach, and honesty is just compelling. But many celebrity memoirs are self-indulgent glorified space filler so I was initially hesitant to buy this. I read an excerpt, watched her on a few late night appearances, and finally my husband picked it up just I think to get me to stop talking about it.     After getting through the first few chapters I felt compelled to tell everyone who walked by me, rang up my soda, sat on a plane next to me, or looked oddly at me when I burst into tears laughing out loud (in public places) while reading that THEY NEEDED TO BUY THIS BOOK.     It is infectious. She writes in such a personal and casual voice that its sort of like catching up with the funny accidentally famous friend you never had. She is absolutely refreshing, in that she's totally secure in her insecurity. She's forthright and blunt, informed and opinionated, and she stands up for herself (and if need be knocks herself down a few notches).     As a young professional, her career advice while slanted to TV/performance is amazingly relevant. I may not have cups of pee around my office, but I've got plenty of hurdles that seem just as nausea inducing and challenging. And her brand of feminism isn't militant or obnoxious, its informed, honest and inspiring. I love that she's smart, successful, and normal and it gives the rest of us striving to be successful women who take on too much, a reason to laugh and feel better about our own crazy drive for and inevitable lack of perfection.     Whether she feels she is or not, she's actually a great role model and even if you aren't a huge fan I don't think you can put this book down without becoming one along the way.
1840220554|5.0|Jane Austen is a classic and I couldn't resist getting a book with her entire works. I loved Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, most recently; Mansfield park. I haven't read the rest of them yet but there are several stories, like Northanger Abbey and Emma, and Lady Susan. There's so much talent to her writing its hard to put it down. I've seen the films but I think the book can bring out a richer experience of the stories too. There's so much in her writing that really speaks to every girl and woman alike, from all sorts of generations, which only a classic can thrive and can stand the test of time. I definitely recommend it for anyone who is a Jane Austen fan or a future Jane Austen fan. Anyone can really enjoy this book.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|It may not be an EPIC! But it is ENTERTAINING! If you saw the trailers, then you know what you are in for. It doesn't let you down. Simple as it may sound. You get what you pay for. Young and pretty fighting ugly monsters in a Sci-Fi setting. I'm not saying it is AWESOME, I'm just saying I liked it. I liked the trailer and so I went to see it. I got my money's worth. I knew what I was going in for and WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! Now a days, that's saying something, especially with ticket prices being what they are in the theaters. Go to You Tube and watch the trailer. If you like what you see, then YOU WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE! Simple as that. If not, then no worries, and it's just not for you. No Harm No Foul. I hope this helped :)

B002ZG994U|5.0|I Absolutely LOVED this. The actors utterly nailed the characters, and it was fast paced and action packed. The camera shots were interesting, and well thought through. The layout of the development of the story was lovely, as it skipped and dance through the plot. It was slightly campy, but the original was as well, and seriously? Its one of the things i enjoyed most out the serious. I really must say, its a fantastic romp into the A-Team. I would adore a sequel.
B0034G4P80|4.0|I went to see Thor because I like Chris Hemsworth since Star Trek ... and he cute.  I am no fan of Thor, I knew Odin and Loki from movies and manga but not Thor.  Sorry ... no idea.  For this movie I like Tom Hiddleston in Loki's character.  OMG he is AMAZING! His Loki turned all the gods at Asgard into villains. Loki is a victim of war.  And he is a son who desperately want to please his father Odin.  Sadly Odin only love Thor (the brat).  Tom Hiddleston fluid performance was unmistakable.  BRAVO!!!
B00005JMCN|4.0|\\"Seabiscuit,\\" writer-director Gary Ross's film of Laura Hillenbrand's beloved biography of the Depression-era champion racehorse and the men who owned and trained him, is far from a perfect film. Scene after scene is bathed in the golden light of early morning or late afternoon. It's got that stately pace, fanatic attention to period detail, sweeping score and overweening prettiness that beg for Oscar nominations. Because Ross is trying to reach a broad audience, his script frequently trips over itself trying to educate viewers about a part of history (the Great Depression) and a sport (horse racing) with which many of us have lost connection. I did not care for Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Seabiscuit's jockey, Red Pollard, which struck me as self-pitying rather than the tough, funny, desperate character of the book. In scenes where the characters are supposedly interrupting each other, the interruptions sound contrived. Fans of Hillenbrand's book will catch and perhaps call Ross out on the way he condenses and eliminates facts to serve his purposes. He clearly wants to tell the inspiring story of Seabiscuit, but he also wants to contrast the \\"we're all in this together\\" helping hand approach of FDR's New Deal with the \\"you're on your own\\" attitude and ever-widening gap between the wealthy and the rest of us during the Bush II era. I could give dozens of examples, but a particularly glaring one, cited by other reviewers, is the scene where Pollard tells Seabiscuit's owner and trainer that he is blind in one eye. Ross wants to show that his hero, Seabiscuit's owner, is not the kind of guy who would give up on someone just because he's down on is luck. Well-intentioned it may be, but as Hillenbrand's book makes clear, in real life Pollard would have been banned from racing for life had anyone known about his partial blindness. Hillenbrand's fans will also miss her breakneck pacing.    Even so, I adore this movie and have watched it with my kids at least 20 times. As one review I read at the time of its release said (in effect), \\"This is not that great of a movie, so how come I burst into tears every 15 minutes?\\" The thing is, the story is really that moving, that often. I can't say how much I appreciate the times when Ross could have gone for the jugular of audience manipulation with close-ups of tears, emotional speeches and 1001 violins, but he doesn't. Instead he pulls the camera back, quiets the cheering crowd, turns the music down, and lets the audience find and feel for itself the grief, or the horror, or the romance, or the triumph over adversity. \\"Seabiscuit\\" is also blessed with a high number of genuinely funny scenes. Most \\"feel-good\\" movies make me feel like a victim of cheap film school trickery, but I find watching \\"Seabiscuit\\" to be an honestly inspiring experience.     SPOILER AHEAD    I'm also happy to report that, unlike in the book (which of course had to go there since it was a biography of a horse foaled in 1933), in the movie, Seabiscuit does not die in the end. I read a lot of books and see a lot of movies about horses. The horse almost always dies in the end, and  I hate it when that happens. It does not matter how often I've read the same book or seen the same movie; even though I know it's coming and try to steel myself, I bawl my eyes out every time the horse dies--it's embarrassing.     If you like the movie and have not read the book, read the book. Even though it will break your heart many times, the book is one of the best I've ever read.    NEGATIVE COMMENT ABOUT THE RACING INDUSTRY AHEAD    Horse racing is a thrilling sport, as you'll learn from the book and the movie. It's also a sport with a a dark underbelly that neither the book nor the movie explores. I understand, at least at a superficial level, the difference between the humane approach and the animal rights approach. I personally fall into the former category. Without getting into that philosophical debate, the troubles with racing from the humane perspective are numerous, but the main ones are these. The thoroughbred industry breeds too many horses. A horse is not a dog or a cat: he needs a lot of space,  a lot of food, costly vet care and normally lives 25 years or more. His racing career is typically over no later than age 6. What do we do with all the racehorses who never win money for their owners or who stop winning money for their owners? Ship them out of the US to slaughter mostly, a tragic fate for an intelligent, sensitive, beautiful animal without which human civilization would not exist as we know it. Second, while some horses bred for racing can be retrained for other careers in the show ring or lesson barn, the way horses are bred, trained and raced contributes to breakdowns that frequently render them unsuitable for other careers. Only a limited number of people can afford to keep horses as pets. Most owners need their horses to generate some income  by giving riding lessons or having paying clients compete with them in the show ring. In the quest for new speed records, thoroughbreds are bred more for speed than soundness. They are broken to ride and raced under saddle too young, before their bones and muscles are fully developed, leaving them prone to unnecessary injuries. A farrier (who is no bleeding heart by the way; his truck is covered with \\"Bush-Cheney\\" and \\"Drill Here Drill Now\\" stickers) told me that he refuses to work in the racing industry because racehorses' hooves are intentionally and unnaturally trimmed with long toes and short heels. This makes them run faster but forces them to carry their weight in an imbalanced way, again leading to unnecessary injuries. Some owners are conscientious enough and well-off enough to make lifetime commitments to their racehorses, but they're still racing them too young. I believe it's possible to reform the sport and keep it exciting, but the way the racing business is currently carried out, I refuse to support it financially. Instead Isupport horse rescues to the extent I am able.  According to Hillenbrand, gambling is what keeps the racing industry financially healthy. If anyone reads this review I would encourage you to do your own research before you go to the track or place a bet.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I'm not a true-blue fantasy fan. But I've read Tolkien, Lewis, Jones, etc. George RR Martin's book series, I'm sure to many, are one of many of their kind. Reading the first book of this series (even before the HBO version) made me realize that I can easily handle fantasy (specially those set in otherworldly medieval kingdoms) and that people like me can completely relate to the drama and the joys of a good, engaging story.<br /><br />It's funny to read comments from \\"haters\\" of these books. Maybe they should play the game version or watch the HBO series first then try plunging back into reading the books. An appreciation of the storytelling might be redeemed.
B004N44SOI|5.0|To a previous reviewer, yes this is not the hard rock you were looking for. But, this album is coming from a different place than the \\"The Heroin Diaries.\\" When I first listened to the album, I was surprised too, at how different it sounded from the previous album and even \\"soft\\" in Nikki's standards. But giving the album a few more listens, the lyrics and the sound will creep into you. The album is a message to those who are persecuted, isolated and even attacked. Its a message for those who don't necessarily fit in and a place to find some acceptance and solitude. The track \\"Skin\\" is a great example of this message. It's a beautiful album because its not like a typical one, the lyrics are sometimes spoken and it feels directed.<br /><br />I love that this is different, and I love that this will save some kids as well. The album itself is a story, a tale for those to learn that everyone is different, and unless you're from the inside looking out, it's very difficult to understand. Take a listen, try to understand the message. This album can be enjoyed by just about anyone because of that.
B0037ODTTK|5.0|It looks great !!!!
B001YIJOI6|4.0|Chanson Francaise is certainly an interesting genre - for every great album thats released, there are an infinite number that are plodding, dreary, and downright un-musical, despite their best intentions. Throw in the fact that much French music is now made outside France, most notably in Canada, and you've got an eclectic selection of albums to choose from - some better than others.<br /><br />French-Canadian musicians in particular are an enthralling set - only because they've given us unlikely stars in the form of Arianne Moffatt, and Pierre LaPointe, both of whom are still rather underrated. But perhaps their finest achievement has been Jerome Miniere, whose 2010 record ranked as one of the greatest albums released that year, in any language or musical genre.<br /><br />Which brings us to Coeur de Pirate, a three-word pseudonymn for young Beatrice Martin, a singer from Quebec who was just 20 at the time of the recording of this album, and who over the span of two short years has gone on to become one of France's twee-music darlings, and rightly so. Much of this appeal has to do with her inspired collaboration with Julien Dore, himself a major media draw, and their resulting duet would go on to set the French singles chart on fire, resulting in widespread exposure for this, her debut album.<br /><br />Beatrice doesn't necessarily possess a great singing voice. Like Vanessa Paradis before her, she has a very sweet, almost saccharine tonality to her voice and she is almost incapable of rising above the register she is singing in. Many critics have criticized this sort of singing as merely 'talking over songs', but I would disagree. She does indeed sing, but tends to play it safe but not attempting notes she cannot score on. Wisely, all of the songs here are easy in that respect, and she floats along on them most winningly. However, she does possess that rare quality of impeccable enunciation - every word and syllable is pronounced beautifully and audibly, and the instrumentation doesn't threaten at any stage to drown her out. Needless to say, this is a virtue that has been lost in many recent french album releases, and its a treat to be able to slip a disc in and understand every word the singer sings, more so when the music is this good.<br /><br />Of course, with every quality production, there are bound to be low points. The general consensus on this album in France is that many of the songs sounded the same. While it is difficult to argue with the rationale behind that sentiment, a couple of plays of the album would render such a claim meaningless. There are minute touches here and there that make every track a standout. Consider the playful handclaps on the backing track of \\"Berceuse\\", a highlight that make an interesting song a really good one. On the instrumental \\"Intermission\\", Beatrice's delicate piano playing takes center-stage, in a surprising move on a wholly vocal album.<br /><br />While this is very much a spring-summer album (most notably on \\"Printemps\\"), its also one that holds up remarkably well in any surrounding. Consider this as the soundtrack to a quiet night at home with a bottle of wine, or a relaxing road trip to the country, and it wouldn't be out of place in either environment. Most of the lyrics deal with love and life, but they aren't exceptionally deep or philosophical; like the album, they are breezy and light, and perfectly suited to the songs they accompany.<br /><br />The standout of course, is Beatrice's much-publicized collaboration with Julien Dore (who in 2011 released his underrated sophomore record 'Bichon'). This is one of those rare instances where the hype is justified, as the 1960s instrumentation and vintage mood to the leads' vocals lend it a quaint likeability that immediately render it as rather unique. Also, Martin & Dore's voices are very much in sync here, each complimenting the other in the most unexpected way.<br /><br />However, my own personal favorite would have to be thestripped-down, almost acoustic-sounding 'Francis', which Martin delivers with rapid-speed wordplay and the lyrics here are absolutely gripping. Although, even if you aren't a native or taught French speaker, you will find it possible to enjoy this album just based on the music and melodies, which again is a rarity. Many non-French speakers sometimes reach out to acclaimed French albums and find that they are unable to enjoy the contents. This happens if the album is heavy on songwriting and low on melody (in France, many such albums are huge chart favorites - the works of Vincent Delerm, for example, are always commercially successful, although you would be hard-pressed to hum even one tune by him; as his strength is his complex songwriting).<br /><br />Yet, there are some albums, such as this welcome debut by Coeur de Pirate, that are accessible to all. Another one in a similar vein is \\"Je Suis au Paradis\\" by Thomas Fersen from 2011, \\"Integrale\\" by L (2011), and \\"Juste Comme Ca\\" by French model turned singer Mickael Miro (2011). All of these are albums that non-native admirers of French music would enjoy, as it isn't imperative that you know the language to appreciate them.<br /><br />\\"Coeur De Pirate\\" is a short album (under 30 minutes), but like Camelia Jordana's brilliant debut, it doesn't need much time to make an impact. It also has a lot of replay value, and that something to be said for a marketplace that is often full of one-play wonders. A solid debut, and certainly an essential addition to your music collection.<br /><br />Four Stars.ich Martin delivers with rapid-speed wordplay and the lyrics here are absolutely gripping.

B003ZDZ1WG|3.0|The new brand of country music, as introduced by Shania Twain back in the 1990s, has admittedly taken on way too much of a pop-air to be taken seriously as authentic country music. While Taylor Swift's music is indeed infectious, it would be unfair to classify it as country music alongside work by George Strait or even Reba McEntire. It just isn't. Whether or not this is a good thing, we now have acts such as The Band Perry, who are armed with a large number of hummable hits set firmly in the pop-country mould. Anyone would hesitate to call this pure country, but once you are past that limitation, this, their debut album, has enough tunes to ensure that it garners both critical and commercial acclaim.<br /><br />It pays to know just how young the members of The Band Perry are, and while this is very much a family affair between two brothers and a sister, it is the latter whose voice carries the entire enterprise. Kimberley Perry is a reasonably good country vocalist - I wouldn't call her a powerhouse vocalist by any means - she lacks the ability to sound convincing in the upper register, and tends to stay with flat tones and isn't especially gifted during chord progressions, but she is good at working within her comfort zone, and the songs don't attempt to overstretch her abilities either. Which is probably a good thing, as there aren't any tracks here that she flounders at. Consider the bands' breakout single \\"If I Die Young\\"; a simple tune that is effective more because of the songwriting than the vocal delivery. Some of these lyrics display a maturity beyond their age; they aren't of the confessional variety such as Swifts and aren't as menacing or typically attitudinal such as Miranda Lamberts', but they are often quiet meditations on life and love, which is why most audiences gravitate towards this band.<br /><br />On tracks such as \\"Double Heart\\", The Band Perry mixes in a few rock elements to their brand of country music, and the results are interesting. All of these songs have potential to be singles if marketed in the right manner, and its evident that the bands obvious qualities (their appearance) have been amplified to their target audience. But as a musical act, there is much they can do to improve. This would perhaps happen over time as the band grows and matures and this would possibly reflect in their songwriting, but perhaps age would also give Perry's voice a more interesting resonance, as there are some tracks here that are rather bland and plain, and not in a good way. While this makes a great `road-trip' album, it isn't one that necessarily works in all settings, which is a pity, considering newer acts like Steel Magnolia have an album out that works wonderfully in any environment. Of course, this would vary from listener to listener and the opinion is purely an individual one. Personally I find the brothers playing far more interesting than the lead singers vocals, which would benefit from a lot more depth.<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Band Perry\\" is clearly one of the more interesting new acts in country today, but in terms of musical artistry I wouldn't put them anywhere near such bands as Little Big Town or Rascal Flatts. They are pleasant, light, airy, and easy on the ears, and this is the sort of music that wont change anyones life, but works as the great soundtrack to a season, perhaps for a week or a month. If that's the sort of thing that interests you, this might be an album you could enjoy.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.ave potential to be singles if marketed in the right manner, and its evident that the bands obvious qualities (their appearance) have been amplified to their target audience.

B004SIP9Z6|5.0|Happy endings are not always happy, and seeing with clarity does not always mean a pretty picture.  Sin City relentlessly drives home the message that no good deed goes unpunished!  In the \\"down in the heel\\" Basin City, To win is to lose, the villians are irredeemable and the heros are not people you want to meet in a dark alley either.  The stories are white knuckle tense and the film noir expertly enhances the clash between villains, heros and anti-heros. Even \\"The Crow\\" did not have guts this hard.  If you are in to gothic noir, Sin City is the movie to see.
B000Z9PYJS|5.0|Obviously any book that carries the prestige of Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" will be a good read.  If you are considering purchasing this book (kindle or otherwise) save yourself the time reading reviews and just get it.    Pi Patel's story is beautifully told in three parts.  Like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" the first part of this book will drag for new readers as you learn of Pi and his upbringing. The second part will engage and excite you to no end as you hear of Pi's story in the Pacific.  The third part of the book will induce you to read it all again.  Tackling the complex and admittedly sensitive and personal subject of religion, faith and emotional survival, Martel and his novel take the reader on a journey that is personal in its interpretation and powerful in its delivery.  Read this with a friend and you will find the discussion after the book is as gripping as Patel's journey.

B002RPR6DU|1.0|Doug Trumbull's special effects are the only reason to watch this movie, but this is the worst script ever.     Whoever came up with the idea that a botanist wouldn't know that plants die without light was partaking of a bit too much of the local flora.    Bruce Dern's portrayal of an emasculated, uneducated, puerile, whining victim was fantastic. I think he caught the true essence of the flower-child movement.
B001992NUQ|5.0|What started out as one of my four or five favorite films has only grown better over time. Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it's sharper, wittier and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades. It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning. On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after two dozen viewings; its cast of characters is wildly varied, and its smirk-smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape. That's what I call an impressive parting shot. A smart, funny, thrilling, unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road. I can't imagine I'll ever grow tired of it.

B00005JMX6|4.0|At it's best \\"The Girl Next Door\\" reminded me of the best teen sex comedies from the Eighties.  One that comes to mind is the relatively obscure \\"My Tutor\\".  At it's weakest it's derivative, if not a downright plagiarism, of \\"Risky Business\\".  The flick's high water mark is the romance between Matthew(Emile Hirsch) and Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert).  There's real kineticism between the two of them and the love scenes between the two set off real sparks.  However, there are long stretches when Cuthbert isn't in the picture.  It's there that the film gets sidetracked by a subplot involving a sleazy pornographer, Kelly(Timothy Olyphant).  To his credit Olyphant is charming and smarmy but it is not he but the script that drag the film down.  Regardless, there's enough wit and intelligence in the film that I give it the pass.
0515149489|4.0|Some call her a victim. Eight years ago she was the lone woman to escape a serial killer's deadly web. Some call her a hero. Seven years ago her fiance and his K-9 police partner were gunned down by the killer in revenge for her escape, but it was her testimony that put the murderous sociopath behind bars. Fiona Bristow considers herself a survivor. She endured. She lived. She fought back, got away, and stepped up, then pulled herself back from the shaky precipice of grief and trauma and moved on, building a decent life for herself on Orcas Island in Washington state.<br /><br />Now Fiona is a respected dog trainer. She deals with multiple levels of group training as well as one-on-one training for dogs with behavioral issues, but she specializes in training search and rescue dogs and their handlers, and heads an S and R team that works with the local and state police on an as-needed basis. When her neighbor, the terse and blunt woodworking artist Simon Doyle pulls into her driveway with a short temper and a bundle of incorrigible puppy named Jaws, Fiona gets both a new client and an opportunity to explore an interesting amount of sexual chemistry. Her life is full with a job she loves, friends and relatives she cares about and enjoys spending time with, and dogs that are her passion and pride.<br /><br />It was an idyllic life bursting with potential until the morning one of her friends on the police force turned up at her house and told her that two women were dead and a new monster had risen to pick up where the previous one had left off, a copycat killer who seemed to be heading closer. Fiona's life was once again in the crosshairs of a killer.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0515149489 The Search]] is an appealing romantic suspense that displays much of Nora Roberts skill with an atmospheric narrative that fully submerges readers into the setting and charms them with appealing characters who are likable and sympathetic. Characterization is one of Roberts' greatest strengths, and all primary, secondary, and ancillary characters are fully formed, realistic, and three dimensional. I loved Fiona and Simon, and I adored the dogs, especially Jaws, who was great for comic relief through the first two parts of the book.<br /><br />I found the search-and-rescue aspects fascinating and well researched, and those plot threads felt authentic and added a lot of emotion to the story. The romance was thorough and satisfying, and Fiona's strength, independence, and obsessive orderliness fit well with Simon's near antisocial tendencies, his artistic temperament, and his inherent sloppiness. There was a great blend of sexual tension and emotional comfort in their relationship as it evolved, strengthened, and became significant, then imperative. Few authors are as talented as Roberts with the ability to slowly age and develop characters and bring them together stronger and better for the pairing.<br /><br />The serial killer and copycat threads were the weakest points of the story for me, and felt unoriginal and tired. The copycat in particular never struck me as anything but a pathetic poser, even as his violence escalated, and he never seemed composed and intent enough to be a realistic threat. Perhaps if his crimes had been blended in a little better than they were, or had more presence in the narrative, but the scenes that featured him seemed sparse and lacked impact.<br /><br />I'm also still confused about the the trend I've noticed in the dialogue Roberts has been writing over the last couple of years. I still haven't been able to put my finger on what it is, exactly, but it almost seems like dialogue shorthand, with a shortened sentence structure and a lack of dialogue description that would normally add tone to the characters' voices. As a result, characters often seem to be speaking in a rapid fire back-and-forth that seems devoid of emotion. It's a bit startling when compared to the fluid, descriptive, colorful narrative that so adroitly captures the setting, painting it in vibrant visual detail.<br /><br />Take those issues out of the equation, though, and [[ASIN:0515149489 The Search]] was one of the better Roberts' romances I've read lately. Fiona and Simon were strong, memorable characters who truly seemed made for each other, and I loved seeing Fiona work with the dogs.

B000002KCV|5.0|Comes a Time (1978) is in my top 5 Neil Young albums of all time. This album exemplifies Neil's folk roots, and even sounds a bit country at times. There isn't a bad track on this release, and the real standouts are GOIN' BACK, LOTTA LOVE, PEACE OF MIND, HUMAN HIGHWAY, and FIELD OF OPPORTUNITY. This album has top-notch production, and is so relaxing to listen to. Neil didn't try to do anything over the top, and the result is a perfect album that's definitive of folk, and most importantly, Neil Young. Neil manages to appeal to a broad array of fans, with releases that cover every part of the musical spectrum. For those who love Neil's folksy music, this album fits the bill. I've found that a lot of Neil Young fans love ALL of his material, because they seem to appreciate his diversified approach and versatility. This album is pure, refined, artistic, and expertly produced. Buy this often overlooked release, and you'll be amazed at how good it is all of these years later.

Since I knew nothing about Norwegian soldiers' roles in WW2, many of those  elements in the story were new to me.  So, in a nutshell, did I love it? No, not yet because there were critical parts to the story line, that I just didn't follow, and I am an avid and experienced reader.  Will I love it? Yes, because I plan to read it again, starting at the beginning. So, if you like a complex, unique plot, this book is for you.  If you are looking  for an easy read, or a romance, choose something else.      I definitely will read more of Nesbo's books.  Harry is somewhat familiar- the rumpled,single, difficult detective, but he is a compelling character nonetheless.      Pros:  Complex, intense plot, interesting hero, very well written    Cons:  Complex plot,  key element is Norway's WW 2 history, with which many American readers are probably not familiar, challenging to keep all the characters straight
B002ZG99N6|1.0|the movie was sent in a little plastic cover and not the real cover for the movie. I did not like it because I colect movies and I want the case of every movie.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I am a devoted Jodi fan - I have read all her books and I have to say that this is my second favorite, if not my number one.  Its probably second only to My Sister's Keeper.  She researches her topics so thoroughly for her books and it shows in her writing, the topic is timely and interesting, and this book (I felt) made you think about both points of view no matter which side you are on, or think you are on.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a well written book about love and the choices we make - whether people \\"approve\\" or not, and whether it is what society feels is \\"right\\" or not.    Great job Jodi, can't wait for your next book.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I hated this book, I didnt like a single person in it to root for. I couldnt finish it,. which is rare for me.
B004SIP7US|5.0|Sorry to ask this question here.  I want to know if this 2011 release is the remastered version like the one released a couple years ago, of which I have already own.  I couldn't find the information anywhere.  Thank you.
B004UID2LC|4.0|i also can't understand why people are having trouble with this. i searched and found every video i was looking for! works great...the negative reviews are obviously from people who have no idea how to push the menu button on their phone!
B003YMNVCA|4.0|I used and liked a much earlier edition of this book; the new one looks as good.  The 4 stars is for the book, the Kindle edition would get 1-2 stars because of the following flaws:    1) The book contains many tables of text information.  These were apparently formatted as images, or at least they are images in the Kindle edition.  The result is that the tiny text cannot be magnified.  Worse, the characters are a very light gray which is very difficult to read.    2) The newer go-to-page-number feature is not supported in this edition; perhaps the feature wasn't available at the time.  Since the authors make many references to other page numbers, go-to-page-number is necessary.    I hope the publisher improves the Kindle edition; otherwise get the print version.
0300169787|5.0|Amazing book. I didn't know what to expect because the price was pretty low so I was surprised when I received it. Good quality photos and I loved the quotes. Plus, the cover is really cool. Great for people who love fashion and art.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|i love this movie first off all they give it another twist than the original red riding hood story and when you watch it it keeps you longing for more you don't wanne stop watching it the director of the movie gives you the idea that it is actually peter who is the \\"big bad wolf\\" but then you begin to doubt if it's really him and not her grandmother who they make very suspicious. all i can say that it's a great movie with amazing actors and its keeps you on the edge of your seat.

030726999X|5.0|Marvelous!  The Saga of Lizbeth Salander continues and unfortunately ends with this last book by Steig Larsen.<br />This novel can be read alone, rather having read his two previous works in this series.  I promise you, however, that if you begin with \\"the hornets nest\\", you will go back and read the first two.  Steig Larsen R.I.P.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Ah,yes! The beautiful Sharon Tate on film. This time as a red-headed vamp,just perfect.Who knows how many more films this goddess could have made for me!!.This film is a vampire spoof,which may disappoint viewer's, but \\"Sara's\\" character make's up for any crying!!.
B0002IQAN6|5.0|I think this is an album that represents a lot of an era that is very hard to come back again. Long solos, very well orchestrated, it's worth having this album and I recommed it to anyone with taste of rock/jazz, because in this early stages, the two types of music collided. The recording is somewhat clean (taking in count the available technology in the time) and in SACD, it sounds really live. My personal favorite is Whipping Post.
B004G600A4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and so did my grandaughters. The animation is fantastic for all the characters, I especially loved the horse, Max. His expressions were amazing, he didn't have to say a word but you knew exactly what he was thinking. I highly recomend this movie for all ages. Amazon had the best price, I was very glad that I had ordered it from them.

B0035G01WS|5.0|I don't share much of a background with David Sedaris, I'm not from a \\"middle class\\" family, I have no college education (IVY LEAGUE even, c'mon), no one in my family has had anything to do with the arts, I'm an only freakin' child, I'm born bred and have always lived in the North West, I don't even have a passport let alone the means to live in any country I please... The list could continue and for some readers things like this make Sedaris' writing out of reach, even insulting.<br /><br />The thing is though we seem to have absolutely nothing in common we do have one thing, tiny as it may be, we the commanality of being human and living during this particular era. That is what connects me to him and his writing, his humble humanity. He knows he isn't a beauty queen, he consistently blunders through life making mistakes, playing the fool even and yet he has this amazing ability to WRITE about it, to share it with thw world and make fun of himself OUT LOUD to millions of readers. I love him for that, I love him for the fact academia hasn't sapped the humanity out of him and made him feel blunder proof or at least made him a blunder snob, hiding behind eight letter words that no one knows the true meaning of, ducking behind an Ivy league education.<br /><br />I picked this particular book up because my best friend is in the hospital, has been, will be, for a while. I have learned that he CANNOT handle being alone so I sit there, hour upon hour and try to read him to sleep. Sedaris' short stories and essays are perfect hospital food right? The problem is reading them aloud for the first time is hard because he makes laugh out loud (and not many do)so in the quiet hospital corridors one room is bellowing with laughter, from me, from my sick friend who really shouldn't be laughing right now, it hurts him, but he won't let me stop. A nurse cruises in inevitably when I am reading something that out of context seems dirty, it becomes even funnier.<br /><br />My context of reading this particular Sedaris book aside it is really a very funny, charming piece of literature that connects with the reader on many levels. The parts that others seem to be offended or put off by, I say read them with zeal, be happy that someone out there is making enough money off being a boob, off proudly being a boob to travel to Japan and France and across the U.S. and is taking the time (for money maybe but whatever) to share his experiences as a pretty much average Joe with us. Be happy to read from someone who relishes in the oddities, who isn't always tring to make you sympathetic and tearful. It really is a rare quality. You will find that most contemporary memoir(ish) literature relies on human empathy and sad, sad, sad, SAD parts of life. It's nice to take a break and read from someone who can tell you abot his mother dying of lung cancer in one paragraph and have you giggling in the next.Comedy or Tragedy, life is what you make of it. Trust me I have my own fair share of the comedically tragic, but when my friends can laugh at the crazy things I say and do when I am hallucinating because Lupus is attacking my brain I am way better than when they are crying over it.<br /><br />David Sedaris has the ability to make you laugh over things that put another way might make you cry. AND he has inspired me to REALLY quit smoking, I am done with cigarettes.reading this particular Sedaris book aside it is really a very funny, charming piece of literature that connects with the reader on many levels.

B00472OBYI|5.0|As a Marketing and Advertising, (specifically in Social Media) professional, I believe that Qualman's book is dynamic and refreshing. In a field of books that are often more fluff than substance, I found Qualman's book informative and substantive.<br />I have recommended it to my clients, who are still wondering if Social Media is a fad.<br /><br />I believe that Qualman's purpose was to show how Social Media is changing the world, not to show exactly HOW to use it. I believe he does a FANTASTIC job at presenting the \\"why\\".<br /><br />It is rare that a book so adequately addresses a revolution that is currently taking place. But in this case, Qualman does an outstanding job!<br /><br />I sincerely believe that sharing Qualman's stories with my clients has helped them do a 180 degree in their thinking regarding Social Media.<br /><br />I believe that anyone with a vested interest in succeeding in today's economy should read this book!

B002V091IO|5.0|Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew have been attending the same university for four years . . . but they only properly meet on the day of graduation.<br /><br />Emma Morley is an idealistic English and History major who truly believes she can change the world (or at least her little corner of it) with hard work and passion. She has had a crush on the impossibly handsome Dexter for four years now, and is both horribly ashamed of her infatuation with someone so self-obsessed, but also terribly nervous that she will never see him after their one night together. . .<br /><br />Dexter is an anthropology student (sort of) who has breezed through university with more drunken memories than grade-point-averages. He had never really taken much notice of Emma Morley, with her thick-framed glasses and badly cut hair. But something about tonight (their last night before the impending doom of adulthood) has seen Dexter enamoured of Emma's close-lipped smile and owlish eyes. But Dexter knows how their little flirtation will end - with him walking out the door and never thinking of her again. . .<br /><br />Little do Emma and Dex (Dex and Em) know that the day they meet - July 15th, 1988 (St. Swithin's Day) - will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship that spans 20 glorious years.<br /><br />`One Day' is the best-selling 2009 novel from British writer David Nicholls.<br /><br />I have had this novel sitting on my shelf since 2009. I bought it because I loved Nicholls's `Starter for Ten' and had it on good authority that `One Day' was another incredible read. But it wasn't until I saw the trailer for the upcoming film adaptation that I was intrigued enough to finally crack the book open . . . and I'm so terribly glad that I did.<br /><br />`One Day' begins in 1988, when Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew attempt to salvage the tatters of an attempted one-night-stand by agreeing to be civil and even, absurd as it sounds, friends. Neither of them have much faith in the other to carry through with the offer . . . but then we jump ahead to the same day one year later when Dexter is travelling (to `broaden the mind') and Emma is stuck in another dead-end job and outpouring her disappointments to her dear friend, Dex, in letter form.<br /><br />And so the novel continues. Each chapter is another year in the life of Dexter and Emma, a snapshot of the day they first met, July 15th, every year for twenty years. We read how their lives are intersecting, drifting or overlapping as they navigate an oddball friendship that amazingly stands the test of time. It's a friendship of highs and lows. Bitter rivalries and broken hearts. Infidelities  and one-night-stands.<br /><br />We meet Em and Dex in their idealistic early twenties, suffer through their mid-thirties, through to the foreboding middle-ages . . . There are years when they are each other's soul-confidante; acting as touch-stones when they suffer through the death of a parent, and post-college down-trodden idealism. Then there are the years when they slowly drift apart - Dexter's career `in the media' sees him enjoying the success and excess of fame, while Emma feels like a second-fiddle friend with a ho-hum teaching career. But they always find a way back to each other, eventually.<br /><br />Their relationship is that of opposites-almost-attracting. Emma cannot deny that she had a crush on Dexter for four long years at college. But when they become friends Emma accepts that Dexter is firmly set in his lad-about-town, caddish ways and will never see her as anything other than a friend. Likewise, Dexter is inexplicably drawn to Emma - her wry wit and earnest disposition that is so different from the usual chits he attracts. Emma and Dexter love one another - they are never better than when they are in each other's presence. They become funnier, more confident, more honest and simply better. But their romantic relationship is one of near-misses and almost's. Love letters that never get sent. Phone callsthat go unanswered. One of them enters into a relationship just as the other accepts singledom . . . all of this spanning 20 long years, until the stars finally align and Em and Dex (Dex and Em) accept what everyone else has always known about their relationship.<br /><br />I love David Nicholls. He writes a beautifully complex mash-up that's not so sugary-sweet that it's chick-lit, but is never more funny than earnest like lad-lit. He really does write cross-gender books that have enough emotional complexity and romance for female readers and wry observations by larrikin characters to appeal to the male demographic.<br /><br />Dexter Mayhew was brilliant. He's a layered character, constantly changing throughout the novel. He is initially a little bit awful - at one point deciding he wants to take up photography because he likes the idea of picking up chicks with the line \\"I'm a professional photographer\\". In the beginning he's as deep as a puddle and egotistical to boot. It's only in his scenes opposite Emma that readers are able to see his appeal. Emma makes him better - she pushes him to be honest and self-deprecating, she doesn't give him an inch and calls him out on his glib insincerity. Dexter is at his funniest when he's trying to keep up with Emma's whip-quick wit. But he's also frustrating - for as much as he is improved by Emma's proximity, and as much as readers can read his betterment around her, he insists on one-night-stands with vapid misses and stone-cold beauties. It really does take Dexter 20 years to wake up to himself and realize what has always been right in front of him.<br /><br />Emma and Dexter's relationship was brilliant to read because it's so bloody true. It's a relationship based on what's not said - all those words and truths that get lodged in your throat and stuck because you're embarrassed or it's not the right time or you might risk the friendship. It's a romance based on `what if?' and near-misses. Dexter and Emma are just two people - you may even have a Dex and Em in your friendship group. Two people who are so obviously meant to be together if they would just get their act together first!<br /><br />What really impressed me in this book was how David Nicholls avoided the `big scenes' but kept the novel interesting and the plot chugging. Each chapter is a snapshot of July 15th of that year. We only read what happens on that day - whether it be a disastrous job interview, a friend's wedding, or a trip to Cornwall. Nicholls constantly references big events that are upcoming or have just been - like the death of a parent, or an impending marriage. But Nicholls never writes the actual scene - we never see the moment in the hospital room when the mother dies. Instead we read about the fall-out and repercussions of that event. It's an interesting and unconventional way to write a book - sticking to the `one day a year' format means that (realistically) all the big moments and dramas won't all conspire to fall on that one day in July. But Nicholls hasn't let that dampen the story or lessen the drama. This insistence on writing snapshots and aftermath means that the novel really does feel like a journey, and a relatable one at that.<br /><br />`One Day' is a fantastically bittersweet story of a relationship that weathers the test of time. Emma and Dexter are two people who fell into their friendship, but managed to cling to it like a life-raft through 20 years of milestones and pitfalls, failures and triumphs . . . always with the knowledge that they were each other's constant, the one person they could depend on in the whole world. I laughed (okay, snorted too) and wept bitterly throughout the novel.

1439102724|2.0|I bought this book at the book store, so all I had to go on was the book jacket.  Imagine my surprise when the main character gets divorced and becomes 'surprise' gay.  I should have read more into 'unexpected love' on the jacket. I just wanted to read, escape, not learn about how lesbians have sex. Buyer beware!
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Simply unwatchable.  I tried to watch it, over and over again. Hopeless acting, characters that no one could care about, hackneyed plot twists, uber-evil Germans, camera tracking that simply makes you lose track of what is happening. There are lots of good WW2 submarine movies out there - this is NOT one of them.     Frankly, our British cousins should pleased, grateful, and thankful that this piece of worthless fluff casts the Americans in the central roles. Me, I'm embarrassed.     This goes off to the charity bin.
0439023521|4.0|When I first read the description for this book, I wasn't too interested because the plot sounded just like Battle Royale, The Lottery, Shanggri-La, etc. Powerful corrupt government decides to control its citizens by subjecting them to sacrificing their children in a brutal fight to the death until one is left standing.     I decided to just try reading the book, and I'm glad I did. Collins's heroine, Katniss, is a teenager who makes you fall for her and root for her to win. Although the overall plot is a little predictable (she gets selected, goes into fight, fights, etc), Collins develops Katniss and other participants (in the games) to make you think about how humans are capable of becoming so numb to violence, even craving violence vs. those who inherently know when something is not acceptable and will stand up for it.     Even though I was expecting it, some parts of the book are really graphic, and leaves you with a disturbed feeling.     Overall an interesting read that will make you think, hopefully the next two books will develop Katniss more and the ideas/message that Collins is trying to get across!

It was the fastest hour of my life because I just sat on pins and needles awaiting the next thing and some things I just never even imagined and therefore; never saw coming.  I have pre-ordered the season and look forward to watching it over and over again.  I cried so hard when Jenna died and the sad thing is, she wasn't even one of my favorite characters but I loved her because of Alaric, Jeremy and Elena!  I was gut wrenching to say the least!

You were awesome with enchanting words and I was stuck to my laptop listening to your words.<br /><br />After that I told myself to get your book but near my place the book was not available until last week. I rush to get it and your book is great. Anyone who has a body need to read your book before doing anything else.<br />It has changed my heart, mind and actions towards things. My handshake, my smile, my words are different than before after reading your book.<br /><br />I give a 5 star and recommend to anyone out there to read this book before it is sold out. Get It Now!
B004HEXSLI|5.0|Great book. Written well and easily understood--even to those not educated in biology or neurology. The chapters describing her stroke are engrossing and extremely mysterious. Loved the book.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|This is Andre at his best. He starts very formally in the beautiful surroundings of the Albert Hall, and gradually lightens up the audience until they are literally dancing in the isles. I particularlyy liked the Glenn Miller Melody, followed by a most inspring imitation of the Andrew Sisters by three members of the orchestra. The playing of the \\"Stars and Stripes\\" is supplemented by half a dozen additional piccolo players. The Show ends with \\"Brasil Symphony\\" surprisingly and solemnly introduced as Beethoven's Fifth Sypmhony (in full!). The whole Show is a joy.

It just makes Gwenyth Paltrow look like a loose drunk, Tim Mcgraw like an ignorant mute and her boyfriend and his wanna be girlfriend totally useless!

Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate work well together. As Ron Burgundy would say \\"You stay classy San Diego.\\"
B004X2M3SI|5.0|I've been a doctor who fan since the new series started, with season 1. I've absolutely loved each incarnation of the doctor.    Some interesting differences I've noticed in the series since Matt Smith took over, however, makes me a little sad. I find that Matt Smith is a little less concerned with the greater mysteries in the universe. They've stopped introducing new species. They've minimized exposure to the great enemies, and the Doctor no longer talks about things like the \\"void\\" and the end of time and other great mysteries that get your mind going!    I loved David Tennant's doctor, because he always carried a sense of a greater, larger picture. Matt Smith's doctor is very here and now, with little concern for any greater picture- it's almost as if the doctor got younger and less experienced.     That being said, I absolutely love Matt Smith, and seasons 5 and 6 are definitely worth catching. Still brilliant writing with potential plot points showing up seasons before here and there. I'm only 3 episodes into season 6, but they've already closed up a huge question from season 5. Something that fans of other series (say.. like LOST) have no such satisfaction.    I just wish Doctor Who was still as mysterious and thinking as it used to be. I want to wonder about what the doctor has seen. I wish he'd give partially revealing information more often. I love piecing together the tidbits he leaves.
B000M343BM|5.0|Best baseball movie I've seen. Very realistic portrayal for a Hollywood sports movie.  Very funny, classic characters, hot shot rookie Willie Mays Hayes, the old veteran Jake Taylor, and of course flamethrower Rick \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn.  A rag tag \\"talentless\\" team comes together to win and get to the playoffs, much to the chagrin of their vile owner.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Blu Ray discs can hold AT LEAST 50GB when using double layer, and more when using more layers. Both the original trilogy AND the special edition of a single movie could EASILY fit on the same disc. Given that original trilogy Blu Ray box set will come with 3 discs, I assume that each disc will hold a single movie. As I said, storage space IS NOT a problem.    George has previously stated his resistance behind not wanting to remaster the original trilogy in higher quality versions is that it would cost money. Money in which he does not want to spend to remaster something HE feels is no longer worth of his time, his original UNALTERED films.    To that, I say he needs to get over it. His arrogance is astounding. This will be the FORTH format of media that the movies will be released on. He has numerous fans that have repurchased the same movies numerous times, not to mention the ticket sales made from the original releases, and theatrical releases. There are many fans that have literally paid hundreds of dollars per film in the course of their lives.     In closing I say this, George is filthy rich, and could afford to remaster the original versions if he wasn't such a douche. Even if he doesn't, it isn't hard to slap the originals on the disc with minimal up-scaling, but he doesn't want to. If each disc has both versions, it's not as though a fan could cut the disc in half and cause Lucas to lose a sale. It still would be ONE trilogy per every ONE buyer. This is about greed, pure and simple. Greed off the backs of people who already paid hundreds of dollars to see the same thing multiple times. He KNOWS he will eventually re-master the unaltered versions in HD in the future, and is using it as an excuse to RE-RELEASE the re-releases yet AGAIN. Boycott this, if you can.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Now to me the remake of the Batman movies like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are to this day the greatest Batman movies yet. Although I grew up watching this Batman Anthology and I always loved watching it as a kid even now on BluRay it's entertaining the picture quality is great the sound is awesome. When I saw amazon had it for only 26.99 I mean you can't beat that price anywhere it was defenitley worth the money so if your a Batman fan buy it now before the price goes up like gas, my house shakes when ever I watch the first Batman with the opening scene with the theme song of the movie it sounds great it's  something cool to show my kids what kinda crappy special effects Daddy thought was cool growing up because obviously there's no comparison to today's Batman from way back to 1989. Anyways for the price BELEIVE ME it's well worth it brand new not used in mint condition I mean you just can't beat it
0066620996|4.0|I read this book for an Organizational Behavior MBA course I took a couple years ago. My initial impression of the book was that it has some great anecdotal evidence of what makes a company great. This was helpful to instill some basic principals into my mind about things needed to make an organization effective. That being said, the author takes it a bit too far in my opinion in over simplifying the factors needed for success. Additionally, using stock price to gauge a company's effectiveness, as the author does, makes almost no sense in my opinion. After working for a few years and being intricately involved in the strategy side of several companies, I can safely say that the book made an impression on me. I still think back to the examples and use some of the principles in this book. I'm glad I read it and would recommend it to others; however, don't expect this to be \\"the answer\\".
0061730335|4.0|Our book club highly recommends this book to those who are looking for a great read on African life in Malawi. It is an inspirational story of a young man who survives a life of threatened and real famine, a lack of the most simple needs of daily living and a desire to be educated. His windmill made of junk not only provided light for his humble home, but opened a door to life as he had never seen before. Great for young readers also.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|The books are great. The pricing, at more than twice as expensive for a digital version that costs a fraction of the cost of printing a book, is atrocious.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Ear bud style headsets will not remain in place in my ears.  This over-the-head in-the-ear style works much better for me.  I bought these as \\"spares\\" to back up my favorite out of production set that are similar design.  The older set folds and has awesome sound but I know they won't last forever.  I bought two pair of the W08L after reading some of the reviews posted here.  As others report, sound quality is very good.  Construction is all plastic so they are very lightweight.  To decrease the possibility of accidental wire damage I added a few drops of quick set expoxy cemement to stabilize the wires against the frame thus providing some resistance to inadvertant jerks on the wire.  I consider this headset to be a real bargain.  Very good sound, lightweight, cheap - that's a triple win in my book.
B004WMKXWM|4.0|First, I would not let a young child see this movie ( +16  years old).  It is dark and disturbing.  I read all the books and have seen all of the movies in this series.  This was not as much fun as the first few movies.  This was a dark, brooding, and disturbing movie which I enjoyed a great deal.  The battle between good and evil is not pretty but it is fascinating and engaging.  A must see for Harry Potter fans, but I don't think I need to tell them.
B003Y5H542|1.0|This is NOT for children.  One character said \\"Go to Hell\\" and another answered \\"Where do you think I can from?\\"  That's when my son and I walked out. 'Nuff said.
0786915749|5.0|The entire Chonicles series is wonderful.  It's a great escape from, what is now the norm, exceedingly graphic fantasy novels.  Tasslehoff and Flint are my favorites!
B004KAB4I8|5.0|For the aspiring dragon artist or the experienced, this book is great.  It may be leaning more towards the beginning artist as it covers color theory, lighting, and your basic drawing complex objects with shapes.  It has step by step instructions that will let you make one of the dragons in the book or make one from your own imagination.  It gives you a good grip on dragon anatomy, and the different ways to draw them.  It's colorful, well-organized, and just overall a great book.  All this artist's books are very well done.
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|Jane Eyre is my favorite book & so I am a tough judge when it comes to the movie. I feel that they did an EXCELLENT job with this movie! I cant wait till it comes out on DVD so I can buy it. They stayed true to the book but my only complaint is that they did not show the scene where Mr. Rocheater dresses as a gypsy. They aso focused alittle too much on the most boring part of the book (when she leaves Mr. Rochester). Other than that the charachters did a great job with this one. I did not like any of the past movies expessically the one with the girl with the fish lips. Also the movie didnt end right..it didnt show the scene where Jane hands him his water and even though he is blind he knows its her. So All in All it was a great movie because the characters did a fabulious job but some of the scene they left out I thought were the best parts of the book. Even with out the scenes I thought should have been included it still out surpassed all the other Jane Eyre movies by FAR. See it you wont be sorry you did.
B004NSULHM|1.0|A programmed Casio organ, a drum machine, and a singer droning on with a high pitched voice, that's about it. I am not a Radiohead novice, have heard all of their albums and I just have never shined to the course they took after their first three albums. The music is not complex, is not entertaining, is just not that good. I know their fans are fanatics and see everything they do as great, so I suppose I am not a real fan.
0060936223|5.0|I bought this book based on reviews and reading the first few pages, I knew of Patti Smith, but never listened to her music. Reading this memoir was like spending time with a friend, now that I'm done reading it, I miss the companionship of Patti. It made me a fan, what a great feeling to discover a \\"new\\" artist! i'm a painter and I was pleasantly surprised to know she was connected to Robert Mapplethorpe, i appreciated her tales about Robert, and I also have a new found respect for his life and work. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate this memoir, it will stay with you.
0380486032|4.0|It took me awhile to actually get pulled into the book.  It was overly descriptive for the longest time which made it quite boring in the beginning because there was nothing to sink my teeth into.  It did turn into a really good story and the author did a great job using description to set the eerie tone and provide suspense from about the middle of the book until the end.  The very ending (actually the last paragraph) was disappointing. It was abrupt and left me hanging.<br /><br />There was no life lesson or history lesson to be learned as there are in a lot of the classics, but it was a worthy read for its entertainment value.
B004ZT9QVQ|4.0|It was definitely a filler episode but it was the Doctor so I couldn't bring myself to give anything lower than 4 stars. The season started out strong and this episode was not as suspenseful as the first two but it had great aspects in it. I am looking forward to the rest of the season as I know the action will pick up.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|Well performed movie that certainly took a LOT of guts to make. The acting was 90% believable. De Caprio has risen above his normal excellent acting career here... fabulous. I saw no acting in the movie that wasn't believable and extremely well performed. My only negative criticism is the somewhat Rambo syle of gun fighting that usually had no effect on the major characters. Watch the movie twice for best understanding.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|Just about everything that can be said has already be said about this album, so I'll just say: I can't comprehend Bruce's fascination with having glockenspiel follow along the melody on so many tunes. It contributes to a sameness of sound from tune to tune that detracts from rather than adds to the core instrumentation.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I am so annoyed at the $20 Kindle price (higher than the hardcover!) that I will wait and get this book out of the library, even if I have to wait a year.
0316069353|5.0|I am an unabashed Connelly fan.  Mickey is not up to Harry in my mind as yet but it will be interesting to see how this develops.  As I do in most Connelly books I had set aside time to read because I know at some point I will be totally taken by this book.  There are so many twist and turns.  Somehow until the end I did not feel satisfied.  Then when I thought about it after it was over I realized I had been lead through these emotions by a true expert.     As others have said the side characters, especially Cisco are terrific.    I wonder why there is such a diversion of opinion on this book.
0316098329|5.0|Just when all of the original plots seem to be used up already, along comes Room.  Its charming little narrator, Jack, is wise beyond his five years, while also incredibly, understandably innocent.  He's sharp-eyed and quick-witted, has a vocabulary of a much older child but at the same time can be hard-pressed to put a sentence together when he's under pressure.  He spends his first five years in an 11x11 cell with his mother.  His father, we learn, is the man who kidnapped his mother when she was a college student.  I loved Jack's voice and outlook.  I also loved his mother's determination to protect him and give him as normal a life as possible while not leaving their prison, and the way she never let on to him until it was time to attempt an escape that he was missing out on anything.  As Jack would put it, this book was a Sundaytreat.
0553386794|5.0|Look, and no disrespect to Mr. Martin, but the guy must be crazy or on drugs.  I slogged through the Lord of the Rings, the Dark Tower Tombs, and others...<br /><br />This work is truly in a class by itself - so much so that I wish I could give it Ten Stars.<br /><br />The depth and detail with which he writes is staggering.  And to have all of these characters running through your head, family histories, legends rich and believable - and to be so well done.  Never at any point did I feel my intelligence being insulted.  The one thing I truly appreciate about the series is NOBODY IS SAFE.  I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN, and once it was over I was elated that I had the others to read on standby.<br /><br />If you really appreciate good writing and a very good story, do this:<br /><br />1.  Go to your local Major Bookstore<br />2.  Find this Book<br />3.  READ ONLY THE FIRST CHAPTER - The Prologue...<br /><br />If you're not hooked - no harm no foul.  If you can't wait to read on, then come back to Amazon.com and buy the series... You will NOT regret it.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Great!
B00127RAJY|1.0|I loved this workout. Even bought a couple copies for friends.     I did Level One for months before moving on to Level Two. I enjoyed Level One, and it did the trick for me. It was tough on the knees, but I followed Jillian's direction and kept good form to prevent the knee injuries she kept warning about.     I rue the day I moved to Level Two ... I did it once or twice, which was one or two too many times. It is a knee killer.    I am in my mid 40s, so my meniscus has been around a while. However I am (or was) in good shape before I began Level Two, so it wasn't due to a sedentary lifestyle or lack of following instruction.    My doctor said many of the exercises in this video are very very bad for the knees. Even if you follow Jillian's instructions to \\"prevent knee injury.\\"    Scheduling arthoscopic surgery today... My knee gives this video one star.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Les Mis is a special musical that shines far and above all the rest!  Three songs into the concert, I was tearing and completely caught up in the emotions of the performances.  The songs are just brilliant!  This production has fantastic audio and visual production quality.  The lighting effects and huge stage arena were really majestic and heightened the enjoyment tremendously!      Casting wise... well, the 10th anniversary cast was better and more well-known for embodying the characters. In this production - Nick Jonas was awful plus terrible (I took away 1 star becos of him), Alfie was superb - v soulful, Cosette was surprisingly winsome and a very pretty soprano, Enjolras was also a standout.  Lea Salonga sang beautifully, but I preferred her as Eponine in the 10th.  This new Eponine was just OK.  I really liked Norm Lewis's Javert - as good as Phillip Quast in the 10th.  Wonderful to see the original cast performing - they knocked it out of the park!  A fantastic DVD for all Les Mis fans (get the blue ray)!
B000268QB2|4.0|Great!
0316056863|5.0|The main criticisms I have read of this book are that it isn't really a memoir, and it doesn't follow a distinct story line. ... I'm sorry, Tina Fey is commentating on her own life. In order. How is this not a memoir? Because she jokes about it? Gives opinions about herself instead of ONLY story telling? Anyway, that makes no sense to me. I thought it was a great insight into things such as 30 Rock, Fey's side of her Palin/SNL gig during the 2008 elections and generalities from her life. She's also freaking hilarious and extremely intelligent. To me, that is all one needs for a great book, fiction or not.    The thing with Tina Fey is you keep wondering, how can a person that REAL be that famous? And conversely, how can someone THAT famous be that cool?     She covers random stuff but in a very deliberate voice. She's not abusing your time or good faith by telling you this stuff, you're gonna enjoy reading it. It is constantly mid-level funny with frequent dips into hilarious. She is so damn funny, and so damn likeable on every level. Proud to own this one.
B0006A9IVQ|5.0|Great! Nice movie
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|Every time I play this game my phone locks up and I have to pull the battery to restart. When it does work it's pretty fun. Hope they work out the bugs for droid x soon!
B000002LCD|5.0|I was around and aware when she came onto the scene.  One of many who made being alive at that time, fun and full of adventure.  Madonna still has that ability today.  I enjoyed the film as well.  Many people didn't.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Adele is a very rare talent.  What it specifically is that makes her voice so compelling, I can't say.  Her resonance?  Her range?  Control?  Whatever it is, she is truly an artist deserving of success.      Her voice rips right through me.  It actually makes me feel exposed, even to the extent of feeling a little uncomfortable.  This is a difficult thing to accomplish as an artist in any medium.  But she has accomplished this through music that is not flashy, distracting, or distorted.  Relating this to film, there are no special effects just music that perfectly frames her extraordinary voice.      Thank you for this album Adele.  I hope you stick around.  Your art effects people on a massive scale that is rarely seen.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Like many others here, I have been a passionate Stevie fan since that day I first heard her voice on the radio in 1976.  And when I say passionate, I mean it.  My daughter's name is Rhiannon.  Enough said.<br /><br />But I was skeptical about this album.  I don't know if it was the Twilight reference, the Twitter account and Facebook page (come on people, anyone who knows and loves Stevie knows she hates Twitter, Facebook and computers in general) or if it was just that I was not moved by the song samples.  Or maybe it was the Dave Stewart connection, having never been a fan of Eurythmics. But like the devoted fan that I am,I ordered my CD.  But I didn't even open it the day it came.  I hate to say it, but I was not expecting to even like this album and I don't think I even wanted to like it. Twilight, Twitter, Facebook, really?  I was just not feeling it.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong and all of you were right.  It is beautiful. It's not like anything else she's ever done, yet I love it anyway.  While I  don't hear what I loved in Edge of Seventeen, Gold Dust Woman, Planets of the Universe, or Rhiannon ~ I hear something more soulful and moving than ever before. It's really hard to describe ~ but it's amazing.  As a collection of music ~ of art really ~ it is probably the best work she has ever done.  It's Stevie enough to satisfy the die hard fans ~ yet different enough to bring her in touch with a whole new group of fans.<br /><br />Rock on Gold Dust Woman ~ you've created a masterpiece.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Originally I had decided not even to bother reading this. By the end of book 3, I was so sick of the constant, gratuitous rape and sheer obsession regarding hymens I was done. However, I confess seeing the books as an HBO show caused me to acquire a little more interest. I re-read the the first 3 books, then went online and got this one. Before I continue with the review of this book let me add that I bought this one thinking it was the last book, and I cannot believe the last book isn't even out yet...I guess it take a long time to flesh out a scanty story and pump a book full of filler.<br /><br />Filler....that's pretty much what this book is along with the rest of the series. Filler, rape, a little plot, more filler, more rape, more talking about women's sexual parts, more filler, a little plot that takes a 180 huh? turn, more rape, more murder and hangings....I'd half convinced myself the books were a little better than I remembered, but that was when I expected the rest of the story to be wrapped up in this book. Five books? sorry, there just isn't that much story. This entire tale along with it's cast of THOUSANDS still could have been told by a better writer in 3 books. The editors share much of the blame for this as telling authors to \\"tighten it up\\" is part of their job.<br /><br />Not the worst book by any definition, but not the best and not this author's best work either. I've quite enjoyed many of Mr. Martin's short stories, I think that's where his strength lies and maybe that's where he should stay, instead of trying to make a novel out of a short story. I'm not sure I care enough to read the fifth book. Maybe if it's free. Maybe.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|If you like the increasingly dark direction the series has been taking you'll definitely enjoy the latest installment. The Blu-ray transfer looks and sounds great. The digital copy will expire at some point, so if thats important to you make sure to pick it up soon.
B001CUXZT0|3.0|After the disco Disney, made-for-The-Muppets production over-reach of `[[ASIN:B001CBW11W Alice Cooper Goes to Hell]]', the follow-up to 1975's seminal `Welcome to My Nightmare', `Lace and Whiskey' was a welcome improvement in tone from Alice Cooper (and, I imagine, somewhat of a relief for fans).<br /><br />This time, producer Bob Ezrin brings a darker atmosphere and an edgier rock sound than he did on `Goes to Hell', but as a whole it is still on the soft side compared to `Nightmare' and the Alice Cooper Band albums. Though there is no horror or shock in these songs (and bluntly, a few are lyrically limp), there is an undercurrent of sex and wretchedness to it which becomes apparent after a few listens. This infuses the whole thing with an unexpected power that will keep bringing you back.<br /><br />The steamy rock riffs of `It's Hot Tonight' start the album off with a sense of restlessness that seems to stay with it throughout, despite the genre-hopping styles of the other tracks. As an opener, it definitely recalls the Alice Cooper Band of old. Possibly the most addictive track in this set follows with the castanet-infused title track rocker paralleling sex with alcoholism (Be as soft as you can, Put a drink in my hand, I'm as scared as I ever could be). The pace picks up a notch with the piano-driven `Road Rats', a song about roadies. Lyrically bereft it may be (We work this band cause we make it rock, But we're the guys that make it roll), but in its self justification that the star would be nothing without the roadie, it supports the developing theme of despair. The fifties-styled boogie of `Damned if You Do' follows, lyrically clunky as it is, continues the pace and theme - this time in the guise of a man at the mercy of his libido. The show-stopping sadness of the signature ballad, 'You and Me' lends gravitas before the vaudeville wink of the epic `King of the Silver Screen' injects some black humour in its construction site tale of gender dysphoria. A pointless and uninteresting cover of Jerry Lee Lewis's `Ubangi Stomp' interrupts the flow before the irresistible dark disco repetitiveness of `(No More) Love at Your Convenience' and the plaintive, heavily orchestrated `I Never Wrote Those Songs' resume the theme prior to the peculiar pomp of the album closer, `My God'.<br /><br />Though the set is a bit uneven, it is lifted by a superb vocal performance from Alice Cooper that is largely devoid of the theatricality that had hitherto characterized his singing. It may be the reason the album seems to have been so badly received. It's true that it is not in the league of `Welcome to My Nightmare' or `Killer', but it has some soaring high points, it's interesting, a bit understated and certainly worth a listen.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have listened to and admired [at times, even 'worshiped'...when I was 12yrs. old] the beautiful and extremely talented Stevie Nicks for the span of over 34 years now [WOW, do I feel old!].  This is honestly the first review I have EVER written in my 5 + yrs. of Internet shopping!!!  It is because I recently saw Stevie on tour w/ Rod then watched her perform [w/ pnuemonia] on Ellen Tuesday, May 10th.  I had to purchase this cd right after watching her perform her new single track from this cd and feeling the hair stand-up-on-the-back-of-my-neck for the 2nd time of listening to her sing and listening to her heartfelt words.     I can not say, \\"this is Stevie's best,\\" only because EVERY song she has ever written and performed, \\"is Her best!\\"  This is just a continuation of her life's journey which has seemed to parallel mine.  I LOVE her ethearial, and at times, haunting voice; I love the words to the songs on this cd that are mimicing my life~where I have journeyed to...right now; and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the harmoney and beat of each & every track on this new album [now you know I feel old, even though I have a 9yr. old daughter and love her hip/hop & pop music too].     If you have EVER been a Stevie Nicks fan, I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed. If you think she is 'o.k.' but have journeyed through addiction, felt loved and then lost that love, and are no, Living In Recovery and feel you understand your life's purpose [...you finally, 'Get It,'] I guarantee you'll enjoy this new release of Ms. Nick's.  And after listening to this entire compelation, now, 6 times, a part of me is 'worshipping' her all over agian for her tremendous talent, creativity and her way of expressing herself that moves me to Actual Tears in some of these new songs. I too am an artist [in the visual field] and dream of being able to move my audience the way she does.  And if you have read all of this review thus far, of my 1st and perhaps last, Internet written review, you know you willnot be disappointed when you purchase this lovely and amazing cd [album ;+) ]!!!

B00509ODFO|1.0|Rated 1 star because of screw-up with file NOT as critique of series or episode see below:<br />Bought the last episode to watch and - guess what - no dialog audio, just music and sound effects. The actors can be seen speaking but no dialog can be heard. All other episodes play normally. Nice way to end 2 seasons worth of story. Amazon-Don't you CRC the the files you sell as a QC measure??<br />Amazon - what's with you lately anyway...
B004QPOVE6|5.0|First a quick word:  After reading the other reviews about the camera madness, I was really reluctant to purchase this.  I had it in my cart, deleted it, ordered it, tried to cancel, but didn't get to it in time.  Bottom line, I am really glad that I bought it.  The camera's in my opinion are not crazy.  There are alot of point of view changes, double screens, sometimes triple split screens, but camera madness?  I didn't feel that way at all.  Once I got used to the POV changes, the concert flowed and I liked the tempo of the changes and face it, these guys move around, especially Angus.  It's ACDC!<br />Now why I rated five stars.  The picture is amazing playing through a ps3 on a new HDTV, I was truly happy with the picture quality, so amazingly bright and clear, and the sound, is also incredible, so clear in fact you can hear every nuance of Angus playing, even the occasional flubs (it happens to everyone once in a while!).  All in all, this band is still great live, such high energy, such great songs.  I thought the song choice was right on, this was in support of Black Ice, so why would they not play songs from it???  When you have a band with such a prolific career you are not going to satisfy everyone when a setlist is concerned.  Also there were a few cute moments, the \\"strip tease\\" of Angus and the devil horns.  As stated by other reviewers these fans are high energy and SO excited.  Their jubilance was a great part of this show, they deserve a star all on their own!!!  Where can I get a pair of those devil horns??<br />I nearly forgot to talk about the extra features, forgive me!  The backstage features are :  The Fan, The Roadie and the Guitar Tech and the Meat.  And another featuring the animation they used on the big screens.  I enjoy the sections on the fans, there are some pretty wild fans in Argentina!  So many slept out there overnight in storms and rain to get the best seats they could.  Music really does unite people all over the world  I also  love the backstage looks.  They  had a soccer game the night before the concert and had to work two overnight crewss to get the stadium ready for ACDC, this was a huge show and required alot of work.  I love seeing the stage builds, preparation, the guys coming out and getting a look at everything as it goes up.  You see all those shots here and hear from the roadies and the guitar techs.  You get shots of the setlist, guitar setups, interviews with many different people associated with putting on the show, including the film producer who talks about selecting Argentina and the challenges of setting up filming.  You get to see them filming.  Some very cool extras I must say.  I also loved the animation (pink floyd and ozzy use animation on big screens too and I dig it)<br />All in all the product deserves five stars, afterall, when it comes to blu-ray it's all about is it worth the money for the picture and sound, I haven't viewed the DVD but I would say YES.<br />One thought, they  had a very cool long cat walk with an extra stage in the center, this was used only once by Angus, during an extended guitar solo/jam.  Brian occasionally went about half way along the catwalk, but I wondered why they didn't utilize it more.  Just a random ??<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.  What a great band, I wish I had been there.  Both ACDC and Argentina know how to rock.ackstage looks.

B003UYUQZW|1.0|Of course acting in a gay theme or any other liberal cause movie gets a person great opportunities in Hollywood. Heath got Batman and Jake gets everything else. Problem is, Jake doesn't fit or act the part. In fact, I haven't seen him in anything where I didn't think a different actor would have done better. He's like the Accademy Awards...all politics, no reality.   The Sands of Time had great possibilities, but like much in Hollywood these days, it was poorly written and acted.
B004X0Y5GI|5.0|Stevie Nicks and Dave Stewart have managed to capture a lightning strike with this CD. It is electric, dangerous, fascinating and absolutely rocks! \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" is probably my favorite song, it starts out like a simple, spoken-word and breaks into a rocking tale of love and lust. Stevie runs the entire gamut on this CD, the intro to \\"Everybody Loves You\\" sounds like a club tune straight out of Atlanta. \\"For What It's Worth\\" is so simple, it sounds like vintage Nick Drake. \\"Ghosts Are Gone\\" with it's driving guitar and Stevie's soaring vocals and lyrics is vintage Stevie herself. Another highlight is the bluesy/rock.country vibe of \\"You May Be the Only One\\". The woman is ageless and amazing!
B00005JMAH|1.0|I think it my duty to add to the single star rating of this NON-ultimate edition. My wife too was thrilled to get the extended versions of the first two Harry Potters. These next two are a complete rip-off of the consumer and ought to warrant refunds for false advertising and promotions. What you expect is the same great continuity WB put into the first two features. Now they want the money without offering anything in return...unless you think a game and a little chit-chat is worth the price of the original movie.  Two Thumbs Down for the dispicable way WB is treating the fan base. It's obvious they care nothing for the public, only about stealing money under false pretentions. Hey! That's the job of our government!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is the best angry birds game yet. its definitely harder than the other two. but its awesome and the environments and everything look amazing. its graphically stunnin. its just an all around good game.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|I really loved just about everything about this finale.  I have had a funny relationship with the is series.  I was a huge fan when it first started but something in the middle of the second season (who am I kidding, it was Lana) turned me off.  Then I spent about five years viciously mocking it.  And whenever anyone would talk about it I would scoff and say \\"I haven't watched that in years\\".  Somewhere during the middle of season eight I started watching it again and became a fan again.  There have been many things about this show that have annoyed me but it was a lot of fun and it made me happy to have something to obsess over. The finale gave me everything I needed.  It was sweet and romantic and full of action and adventure.
B000P0J0A6|1.0|Alright. I was going to leave it alone. It had been a long time since I saw it anyway and I had only vague unpleasant memories about how utterly pathetic and gruesome  it was. Until I turned on the television network called \\"Hub\\" a so-called \\"Family\\" network and saw this stupid little poor excuse for a movie again.<br /><br />I'll start with the ending because that's what REALLY Threw me. I can't spoil it all  so I'll just say this: They don't do anything. After  these evil little creatures have killed people and destroyed the  town. their creator simply says the world isn't ready for Gremlins. THAT'S IT!!!!!.<br /><br />Secondly, what on earth made the man think that this would be a good pet  given the risk????. I mean sure  there was a clear set of instructions  don't put it in light or water and don't feed it after midnight but usually if  instructions aren't followed when it comes to pets the worse thing that happens is they die. not turn into completely evil, ugly looking, murderous, idiotic creatures.<br /><br />This is not a family movie and it is definitely not  for children. It will give them nightmares. The events also take place around Christmastime I'm pretty sure a kid wouldn't want scary memories associated with that holiday or  time of year.<br />I think whoever made this should be punished. It's that bad.
B003EY7IUY|3.0|Like another reviewer said, it was totally predictable and I'm kind of over Becky's antics.  Come on!  When something over the top happened (that Becky thinks is totally normal, rationalizes it, and it must happen to everybody), you as the reader always knew that it was going to somehow end happily-ever-after Cinderella style!  And Luke- just puts up with her monstrous charades.  Seriously, this book pushes the limits of what a marriage can survive!  No modern-day marriage would have seriously survived all her crap!    And I'm mad that I paid more for my kindle version than the paperback AND I can't loan it.  I kind of rationalized the price by thinking I could share it with a friend, but no!  If I'd just bought the (CHEAPER) paperback, then I could of at least HANDED IT OVER TO A FRIEND TO BORROW!!!!  DUH!  C'mon Sophie and Amazon, that's just wrong!    SERIES NEEDS TO END!  But now, we now from how this book ended that there will be yet another one back in the states...I know right now, that I WILL NOT PAY TO READ THAT ONE!
0393037010|5.0|I saw the movie with Crowe/Bettany.  I distinctly remember not wanting it to end.  While speaking with a Brit I worked with who happened to have been in the Royal Navy, he told me about the books.  Said if I loved the movie, I'd really love the books.  It was so.  I bought and read the first 6 or 7 hardbacks and then listened to the rest on my iPhone because it's less time consuming (you can do it while driving, mowing the grass, working out, etc).  I would read the first one though, to get a feel for the language and sailing terms before listening to them.  These books will always have a special place in my heart - they helped me escape to another world during some personal family tragedies and I'll always be grateful to them.  This review is actually done for the second copy I've bought, this one is a gift to a friend who teaches executive leadership and loved the movie.  Just read the first one and see for yourself.
0316069353|5.0|Nothing is what it seems to be in The Fifth Witness.  Nothing is what it seems to be in The Fifth Witness, even the title is a misdirection.   Michael Connelly is at the top of his literary game in this legal thriller.  I must say up front that I like a good legal thriller, and I enjoy Michael Connelly's writings.  Ergo, I liked this novel a lot.  Basically, this is a murder mystery whodunit along the lines of the old Perry Mason TV show.  There's a murder, a likely suspect, a tough prosecutor and an equally tough defense attorney-Mickey Haller.  Everything seems to point to the defendant's guilt until Haller begins to unravel the prosecution's case.  Still, it is an extremely difficult uphill slog with numerous twists, turns and misdirections.  The prosecutor is sharp and builds a terrific case.  Haller scrambles, the defendant cries, the judge is exasperated, and the jury is mesmerized by all the legal maneuvers and shenanigans.  Interject lies, deceit, histrionics, family problems, the mob and a few other juicy morsels and you have a terrific read.  I don't want to go into more story detail and spoil the reading fun.  Suffice it to say even the ending is not what it appears to be!  How many twists and turns can Mr. Connelly cram in one novel?  Lots-and that makes this simply a fun read to the very last paragraph.  Character development was excellent:  A Michael Connelly trait.  With each new Mickey Haller novel we learn a little bit more about the intrepid defense attorney and his staff.  And yes there is something startling new in this novel.  No gratuitous language, sex, violence.  Just a good, clean, legal whodunit.  Superb read.  I highly recommend The Fifth Witness.  It is a great beach read and/or will take the sting out of the long miserable airline flight to anywhere.  Looking forward to Mr. Connolly's next thriller.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i love the game but i keep getting a package error that won't let me install the update. with all the money you guys have made off of angry birds the least you can do is fix the bugs.
B001SMC91M|5.0|If you are a fan of funk and soul, then it is inevitable that you will find this to be GOLD!<br /><br />The amazing song \\"Sugarfoot\\" is right up there with anything Clinton/P.Funk/Rick James/Sly have ever done
B0036EH3WK|4.0|This is a very great show from start to finish. I got this product on sale and it was worth it just for the extra bonus features. The box really isn't anything special but like I said, there is over 2 hours of bonus features that don't come in other sets. They interest me so I am really happy with my purchase
B004LZRSBY|5.0|Amazon shipped this last weekend to my place.  I have been playing the blu-ray on a daily basis since then.    First off a-ha delivered a picture perfect performance.  Morten's voice is amazing through out the whole show.  They played all their big hits from the 80's, as well selections from their last 4 albums (2001 and onwards).  A total of 20 songs.    The Blu-ray is shot crystal clear.  Unlike U2's Rose Bowl Blu-ray, this one is actually shot in 1080p.  There are no blurry, or grainy shots, seems like these Europeans know how to a shoot a good concert.    The sound is also really good.  Two options, either Stereo 2.0 channel or DTS-Master HD for those that have sound systems capable of handling that.  You can hear every instrument and vocal harmony very clearly.    All in all one of the best blu-rays that I have ever seen (I have a huge collection at home, from Rush to U2).  I was sad after the show, since I probably will never ever get to see this amazing band live.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|What an excellent story book, up there with the best of them. I loved the writing, the imagination, the adventure, the sadness, the excitement,the happiness and whilst reading wondering what will happen next!!!  I just could not put this book down and found myself alone in the lounge reading with the voice in my head saying - only one more page.......
B004MOMT2M|3.0|I purchased DVD-AUDIO version  I am very disappointed and I have lot of complain this    1, not clear each instrument sound and very fuzzy on surround sonud     where is guitar , where is bass , where is drum and also keyboards where  2, bass sound is not clear , sometime I can't hear it  3, \\"Camera Eye\\" was not original track     Geddy's singing was not original that's truly alternate and no echo treatment    This is failure example to 5.1 surround remix    CD was same as previous released remaster version I think  no remaster at this time
0316067938|1.0|I'm not yet to page 200 and will throw this book away.  Everything the other reviewers who gave it a \\"1\\" said is true.  It just isn't worth my time to continue reading this disappointing conclusion to the Twilight series.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|a delightful little game. it keeps you entertained and has a variety of options to modify the four games to your liking. reccomended for anyone. and i usually hate billiards.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Terrific production that PBS used for a fund raising special. I had to have an edition that did not have all the fund request breaks interruptions.    Les Miz is the best music ever developed for the stage and the British again provided a fabulous production of this masterpiece.
B001UW58WW|5.0|He's not only gorgeous, his violin is awesome. I saw him play on Dancing with the Stars, and had to have the album. I want the rest of his CDs.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie Nicks' IN YOUR DREAMS debuted on BILLBOARD's album chart in the top ten, and it will likely nest there for summer.  Original, uncompromising, and refreshingly reminiscent of music done for artistry's sake, IN YOUR DREAMS grows on the listener with each play, just as RUMOURS grooved into the pop/rock psyche of the late 1970s.  Few singers fuse work and pleasure so effortlessly and convincingly as Nicks.  All of her solo albums jolt and ease at the same time.  No one rocks and reassures like this, surveys and scopes like this since Elvis.  It's the Grammys loss if the NARAS does not reward Nicks' solo efforts--at last!
0316067598|5.0|I've read around 15-20 military history books and this is by far the best I've read. Very hard to put down and truly emotional story. If you are going to read one book, I suggest Lone Survivor.
B004SBX112|1.0|STILL cannot update this game. the app force closes anytime i try to install. considering getting rid of the adfree just so i can get the updates!
B000003S5H|4.0|This album is very relaxing and atmospheric.  It's a solid listen through and through again.  There is always something new to be uncovered from the music with each listen.  My favorite has to be \\"All I Need\\".  With songs like this, it is easy to melt away with the music.  The record seems to go by in mere minutes but I didn't feel that there were any weak points.  Some tracks stand out but nothing was a downer.  This is an album that I reach for when I feel the urge to kick my feet up.
0425241505|5.0|Normally I am not a reader of Romance or novels that include other worlds or strange beings. (Is that Sci Fi?) But I was hooked on this story from the first paragraph. The characters are real, honest, emotional, and funny. I could not help but get involved in their action, worry about them, root for them, and over all enjoy their humanity. The story is an old one of man meets woman but there are many twists, turns, and surprises, as well as intensity, heat, and outright tear-welling love. I'm recommending it to everyone I know.
B000W022XG|4.0|As oxymoronic as this may sound, the album is creepy yet so beautiful.  Beth Gibbons has unique and enticing vocal inflections which matches the creepy atmospheric music very well.  The beats are so chilling to the bone that it could make Havoc from Mobb Deep blush.  Although Beth's energy may not vary from track to track she still does a fantastic job in complementing the dark atmosphere from beginning to end.  My favorite song on this record would have to be \\"It Could Be Sweet\\" which has this jazzy lounge type of vibe with a punchy bassline.  I also dig the drums on \\"Glory Box\\" which utilizes a vintage Isaac Hayes sample to great effect.  This is an excellent entry point to anyone who wants to get into Portishead.
B004X4QW42|5.0|This film is a fun throwback to the good ol' days of kung fu. I thouroughly enjoyed it.  I am not a movie critic just someone who wants to be entertained and this movie succeded
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This was a great movie at a great price. I also have the six CD set and I enjoyed watching a couple of the previous movies before watching this one.  For the most part, I don't believe the movies can do the books justice - but this one came close. I pre-ordered the movie, and as usual, Amazon delivered quickly and at a good price.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I love these Ram mounts for attaching items like my phone, GPS, cup holders, etc... to my motorcycles... I shop around and found this Seller to be reasonable in price and fast on shipping. I would recommend them to my friends.
0071752854|5.0|As a huge fan of the author's work , and the articles on his website, I was excited last week to finally get my hands on his new effort: Pitch Anything. In this book Klaff's  basic thesis is that we pitch our deals and ideas from one part of our brain (what he calls \\"the supersmart neocortex\\") yet these are received in the other person's crocodile brain. Instant mis-match. And problems ensue. Klaff uses many examples (all are interesting and ones you haven't heard of before) to demonstrate how to solve this mis-match. He shows you these methods in action and in high-stakes situations, Such as when he was thrust into a deal worth $1 Billion. I won't reveal the outcome... it's worth the read if only to get the insider's POV on such a massive deal. This has always been Klaff's talent: taking real world deals, the big and high stakes deals, and bringing them into the public's view through great journalism and storytelling.     Klaff is also careful to examine the flipside of this phenomenon: the times when the neocortex and the crocodile brain miscommunicate, unchecked, leading him  to disastrous results. For instance, he presents examples where the mind works based on biases that don't necessarily enter the realm of conscious thought, and situations where he didn't win the deal, didn't pitch the great pitch and wasn't the most popular guy in the room. Few authors are willing to self deprecate in this way.     It's a great topic and Klaff sets it up with some fast paced and wish-i-had-been-there examples, but a word of caution. First, the book is very anecdotal. You should read the sample chapter in the Amazon Look Inside feature to see if this writing style is for you. Anyone who has ever had a 200-level psych class knows that Klaff is at the same time explaining these methods TO you, and using them ON you. Given this, I found that I read some chapters more than once, especially chapter 3. First time for the fun narrative. Second time to learn the method. Third time, to see how the method was being used on me - the reader. For instance, Klaff describes a subtle technique called Prizing. This, in essence, is a way to make the customer earn your attention (instead of you constantly trying to win his) or make an investor defend why he should be allowed to invest.  But re-read that chapter. Klaff is \\"Prizing\\" the whole way through. Well played sir.    One of Klaff's strengths is in recognizing interesting cognitive events that are recurring in the business world, and then bringing them into conscious awareness, describing them so we actually realize when these things are happening in our own business and personal dealings. I think he's partly achieved that in this book, but it doesn't come together until you fully get into chapter two, which describes frames, framing and frame control. This is important stuff, This is not a book of sales scripts, and this subject is not for dummies.          The writing is enjoyable - I read the most of it in a single plane flight. Some of the insights provide building blocks for understanding how certain professionals  are able to present themselves so much better than others. They are essentially doing  something that doesn't register at the conscious-level but they are using a real method none the less - called Hot Cognition in Klaff's lexicon. He's a good documenter of new curiosities of cognitive skills everyone needs in business (sort of like a Michael Porter is to Business Strategy) and the storytelling is good enough for a full morning's entertainment.
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|Boring and not very funny.I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this.If your kid has a short attention span,then skip it!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This book is a compilation of folk tales that were passed down generations, which are full of contradiction and negatively influence the ability of reasoning. It is a real waste of time. If you want to be ethical and wise, read science and philosophy books.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|An amazing story off a dog's loyality and devotion to his master.I love movies based on true stories especially true stories about animals.If your a dog lover,you will love this movie.It will definitly pull at your heart strings.Richard Gere was excellent in this movie.Don't pass on this one!
B003F76HFC|5.0|I'm not a 'Shopaholic' fan. Full stop. Way too 'chick lit' for me. That being said, I decided to give 'The Wedding Girl' a go anyway. Kinsella writing as Madeleine Wickham was so much more satisfying for me. I woke up at 3 AM and couldn't sleep, and had read the story up to chapter 6. Before I got back to sleep about two hours later, I was done. Lots of interesting twists, though I read enough to be able to see most of them coming. I think too many people believe this to be a failure of the author when they're just slightly jaded readers. The protagonist was a bit flat in spots, but I hate brides. Full stop. Drop your voice. That whole 'yes the sun does rise and set on me attitude', I suppose. At least in this story, her mother was the worst. Loved Isobel, and wish we knew more about her. I would also have liked to know more about Esme. Anyway, a very good read, but if the fluff of 'Shopaholic' is your thing, this likely won't be. I like my stories with a little more meat on the bones and Wickham nee Kinsella has provided more than amply here.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This item was received in great shape and timely shipping.  I am very satisfied with the whole transaction.   It is one of the greatest movies ever made.  The music is awesome and fun from the 70's.  Makes you feel like singing and dancing.  Great mood lifting.  The actors couldn't be better.  My friends & I have seen it many times and will see it many more.  It is an all time great.!  Don't miss it.
B00008DDRX|4.0|Mcqueen was quite an accomplished driver on his own, let alone a well respected actor.  He wanted to do a movie that represented all the emotion that is such a big part of motorsports.  The best venue to capture all the emotion and paegentry of racing is Le Mans, France.  The cars and driving sequences are incredible and are for a racing enthusiast.  If you're looking for a film that gets your adrenaline running with high rpm close ups then this is the film for you, however if you are looking for a film with a deep plot then you might want to consider another film.  A must see for any racing enthusiast and \\"true\\" Steve McQueen fan.
B000002IJL|5.0|This movie brought back so many memories. The acting was terrific and it makes you realize what a loss for hollywood with River Pheonix passing on.<br />The sound tract is great. Wish they would have had a few more songs in it.
0756405890|5.0|Often when I start a fantasy novel it takes maybe a hundred pages to feel comfortable with the characters, the land, and the setting. I was sucked into Rothfuss' creation almost right away. There's a little confusion as he sets up the tale, but his imagery is beautiful and the main character, Kvothe, is easy to identify with.  Usually I read sporadically and may have four or five books going at once (not all fantasy novels), but I can't hardly put this book down. I try to watch TV and find myself reaching for the book. I try sleeping and I find myself saying, \\"Just one more chapter.\\"    I'm anxiously awaiting the paperback version of the second book - I'm too strapped (cheap) to buy the hardcover.    I don't know what paperback Amazon is selling here, but mine lists at $8.99.    Bottom line - anyone into fantasy should love this book.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|this fits my needs perfectly.  I wanted a slick way to view and basic edit my Picasa albums outside of the native Android gallery application.  It is also a lot easier to navigate this application than the website on my Android devices.  It works perfectly on my thunderbolt and xoom.  my only complaint is that it seems this application gets updated on the Android market faster than the amazon app store.
B00127RAJY|4.0|OK...  I'll be honest I like it so far.  It was literally the hardest work out I've ever done the first day, but after I had done it for about three days it was great!  I've lost 4 lbs so far and I'm seeing a vast improvement in my stamina in house hold chores and keeping up with my eight month old daughter.  If you don't have any physical restraints like bad knees I say give it a try.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Loved the book. Sure, I was confused in some parts, but the journey was awesome.  If you like fantasy, you'll love this
0316069353|5.0|I have read all of the Mickey Haller books thus far and this was my favorite. It has a good level of detail and good amount of suspense leading up to the final chapters. Very well written and nicely paced. Highly suggest.

B004ZISVWC|5.0|I had heard of this film from MovieBob over at the Escapistmagazine.com and rented it on his recommendation.  And I can see why he loved this movie so much. Possible spoilers, but I'll try to keep them to a minimum.    Under the presumption of a bear poacher, a trio of college students set out to find out whats going on with a rash of dead bears across the country side. By the name of the title, you can see what they end up uncovering.  Very soon they come to find out that not only are trolls real, the fairy tales behind them aren't all lies, nor truths.     What I love most about this movie is the camera work. That may sound a bit weird, but after watching \\"Cloverfield,\\" you'll like the camera work too. The camera is steady nearly all the time, with realistic small bounces as the camera person runs, but only shakes terribly when dropped, which makes sense.  It lets you really get a look at the trolls when they have their fleeting moments on camera.  Just long enough to get a true sense of what they look like, but scarce enough to still leave you with a sense of wonder in the world's forgotten creatures.    The characters are nicely done too. The Trollhunter himself is nicely portrayed as a man sick of the secrecy, and terrible conditions of his job. The college kids do a nice job of being just some naive people who get in over their heads once the reality of the situations set in. And the trolls are nicely characterized by their actions, and reactions.      The CG is pretty good, nothing to make your jaw drop in disbelief, but used to do what is needed to be done. Plus the beautiful countryside makes for some nice scenery as their journey progresses, from the fogged in shorelines, to the plains of snow up in the mountains.     The last thing of note is explanations. I loved how they took some time to explain how the trolls live, and thrive. Why they react the way they do to sunlight, and other things that set them off.  The ending does leave a possible opening, I suppose, for more movies. But I for one would rather that not happen. I feel the filmmakers gave just enough of a taste of this parallel  world, to leave us satisfied while wanting more, which is where they should leave it. I highly recommend it for those who want a good thriller, with some light humor, and a great finale reminiscent of the game \\"Shadow of the Colossus.\\"
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|HTC - Incredible: This game is very enjoyable and entertaining. I laughed quite often at the absurdness. The game runs well though it can get laggy at times, but restart it and it's fine. Definitely recommend.
0756405890|5.0|This book is amazing. It's like the beautiful and dangerous love child of  Wizard of Earth Sea, LOTR, and Narnia.<br />Read this book.<br />Seriously, read it.
3931141802|5.0|This is a remarkable milestone in photography with candid pictures of all sorts of ordinary life. The picture of a segregated street car in New Orleans in the 1950's is haunting. The book itself was brand new, as promised, and the intro by Jack Kerouac was a pleasant surprise.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Great story of a man who was not destined to be King but who turned out to be the best for the job at the time.  Historically correct and wonderfully acted.
B004LAIU4I|4.0|Looked forward to a new album by Paul Simon.  I have enjoyed it, and the more I listen to it the more I am finding favorites, however it is not as outstanding as much of his previous work.  Grace land is one of my favorites as is Bridge OverTroubled Waters and others that go back to his Beginnings as a recording artist.  His biggest problem is, he has set the bar so high it's difficult to top himself every time he releases a new album.  I still recommend this album but I wish  he had included a couple more new tracks, since this one only contains ten new songs.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|First of all, yes, this is a fantastic and worth while book.  I wish that other raters/reviewers would PAY ATTENTION to the difference between providing ratings for the book as opposed to the seller.  This book should always be viewed as a classic and a five star or at least 4 star.  I read this book some years back but this tale of absurdity and murder and detatchment/alienation of the main character delivers some stimulating reading.  Ambiguity makes this book what it is.  I found this to be my favorite Camus novel and that is saying alot because his books are typically pretty good.  So I won't give away too much but I will remind people to be aware of what you are rating because this book deserves a little respect beyond 2 ratings of one stars it was given.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I bought these about a year ago and, I have been very satisfied with this headset. First of all, it is extremely comfy, and I can use this all day without feeling any discomfort. It can get a bit hot, but I love the cushons. Sound quality is good, and mic quality is great as well. I record a lot of my own videos and sounds very clear. I skype a lot while gaming and my mic produces clear sounds perfectly. Noise reduction is awesome, stops all the fuzzy sounds and makes your voice come out very clear.  After a year or so it still works, but unfortunately a few days ago I seem to have damaged it by opening it too wide and I heard a crack. The microphone is somewhat not working at certain angles. It kind of just happened during an important game and I was very upset. But overall great buy, I might actually buy another one right now
B001PJ1QJY|5.0|And I wore it out.  Now I'm so glad to buy it electronically so I can play it to my heart's content.  :)

006145205X|5.0|Pick your favorite scenario for what you think 2100 will look like:    A) Massive natural disasters will have annihilated most major cities. Pollution and toxic waste will have made much of the planet unlivable. Those humans who survived the Earth's massive calamities will be living in small, sustainable communities, armed to protect themselves against outlaws.    B) We'll be living miserable, overpopulated, filthy lives under global governmental tyranny. We'll have to steal or eat squirrels to supplement our meager government rations. We'll constantly be under surveillance, even in our private lives. We won't be able to do anything with government permission. Global elites will have built cities apart from the world's commoners.     C) The world will be more prosperous than ever before. We'll have avoided massive global warming by uncovering new, sustainable energy sources. Most of us will live in megacities, but will still be able to visit forests, lakes, and other natural resources. We'll be well-fed, clothed, and safe.     D) Zombies!    In this book, Matt Ridley proves that we're headed not for calamity or misery. Instead, we're going to see something like option C. We'll probably have more food, less disease, more income, a longer lifespan, and better lives in general.     What makes Ridley think that things are getting better? 100,000 years of human history, which he covers in his book. He uses patterns from that span of human existence to illustrate that our capacity to change and adapt will bring us successfully through whatever problems we face. These problems even include collective boogeymen like global warming, economic crashes, and deadly diseases.     Ridley's Reality    Throughout the course of his 359-page book, Ridley tracks human evolution, from cavemen to the modern Homo Computus, to prove that the world has steadily improved over time for humans. There are two main reasons for this.    1) Trade is good.   Trade, which Ridley defines as the \\"market process of exchange and specialization,\\" is ancient. It's inherently fair, in that it creates changes that benefit everyone.     Over the years, an increase in trade has led to an increase in innovation, improving the quality of life for everyone. Free trade inevitably creates mutual prosperity (protectionism does the opposite).    2) More specialization and exchange lead to prosperity.   Prosperity is \\"the increase in the amount of goods or services you can earn with the same amount of work.\\" Increasing specialization and more exchange are the root cause of innovation.     When exchange, invention, and specialization proliferate, a society \\"creates\\" time. As a result of this proliferation, modern people have specialized occupations, but consume hundreds of diverse things. This is the definition of a higher standard of living.    Much of <em>The Rational Optimist</em> comes back to these two main points. Ridley makes a slew of other, smaller points in the process, always using research and historical examples as proof. The following caught me eye:    * Commerce has helped make the \\"is as good a place for the average human being to live as it ever has been.\\" Capitalist success, in other words, leads to social improvements. Moreover, Ridley finds that \\"people get happier as they get richer.\\" Money does buy \\"general well-being.\\"     * Self-sufficiency leads to poverty. This is because bigger, more connected populations innovate more, while smaller, less connected populations tend to regress. Human beings depend on numbers, connections, and trade to succeed. So our nostalgia for farming and sustainability is just that--nostalgia. It doesn't represent progress.     * City dwellers are better for the ecosystem. Cities house half the world's people while using less than 3% of global land area. Country dwellers take up more space, use more energy, and impact the environment less.     * Fossil fuels like gas and coal, as well as the machines you use every day, have replaced human labor (slaves) over time. So, in a sense, they are your slaves.     * When the world started relying on fossil fuels for energy, economic growth became sustainable for the first time in history.     The Rational Optimist's 10 rich chapters include innumerable examples from diverse fields, including anthropology, history, biology, economics, and even Hollywood movies. These examples, as well as Ridley's own skill as a writer--and occasional cheekiness--make for an entertaining, if highly detailed, read.     Thoughts    The Rational Optimist has all of the elements of my favorite kind of book:    * The author uses studies, research, surveys, and solid evidence to make his claims.    * It covers business and the economy, but with emphasis on human behavior.    * It takes the long view of humanity, covering around 100,000 years, rather than elaborating on a fad or short period of time.    * It's entertaining.     Perhaps most importantly, The Rational Optimist challenged me to see things in a new way. For example, Ridley makes the case that although global warming is happening, it's completely hyped. The net harm from expected global warming will not be as big as the harm being done today by hunger, dirty water, indoor smoke, and malaria, according to Ridley. If the globe indeed warms as much as we expect it will, \\"it will be because more people are rich enough to afford to do something about it.\\"     Indeed, Ridley makes a number of points that would be considered biased towards economic conservatism, from an American viewpoint. He supports free trade and thinks all governments (he calls them monopolies) eventually mess up innovation. Yet innovation and open trade are necessary for a country to prosper, so it's odd that smart people put too much faith in government for no good reason. He is pro-fossil fuel, pro-city, pro-genetically modified foods, and optimistic about humanity in general.     Yet instead of using rhetoric, he employs evidence and centuries ofhuman history to make his points. This is precisely what makes The Rational Optimist so valuable.     Recommended for Some    I welcome new, intelligent perspectives on human life, so I happily devoured The Rational Optimist. Yet I could see Ridley, who isn't shy about bashing leading thinkers (and especially environmentalist Paul Ehrlich) irking other readers. If you happen to be an extreme environmentalist/liberal/fan of organics, this book might tee you off, depending on how staunch your views are. Ditto if you want something quick and to-the-point, rather than long and detailed.     If you like seeing things debunked, however, pay attention to The Rational Optimist--you might like it. Same if you like reading about human history for hours, if you like having your viewpoints challenged, and if you enjoy laughing out loud on occasion while reading. This has been one of the best economics-related books I've read in the past couple of years, so I do recommend it overall.     (Book review by Drea Knufken)
B004G600A4|4.0|I don't usually like the cheesy Disney animated movies. When my wife forced me to watch this with her, I was less than excited.    I was pleasantly surprised though. This is actually a pretty entertaining movie. Plenty of humor, action, and good characters make this fun for pretty much anyone.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Yes, the movie addresses the issues of an afterlife in interesting way, possibly requiring that one does a little more research to see what information is truly out there, since the number of people brought back from near death (i.e. near-death experiences) is huge. But the movie is more of a rich character drama and weaves a story of how the characters eventually interact, which is vibrant and facinating. I found that adding real life scenarios, the 7 July 2005 London bombing and the 2004 Indonesian tsunami (which brought back memories of the incidents) added to the realism of the film. Also, the fictional character of Dr. Rousseau (Marthe Keller) seemed to be based on Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (Swiss-born psychiatrist, a pioneer in Near-death studies and the author of the groundbreaking book On Death and Dying (1969) and who also encouraged the hospice care movement).  Clint Eastwood, as director, is  confident, smooth and accomplished. The original music by Mr Eastwood is appropriate, romantic and beautiful (and of course, the 2nd Piano concerto by Sergei Rachmaninoff is seminal and profoundly romantic). I loved the film (possibly with one or two hiccups and a bad attitude towards organized religion) for what it conveyed, the grounding of a supernatural subject, and the penetrating character studies.
B001QWBM62|4.0|There is a problem with the Zoom H4n DIVIDE function and it is NOT an isolated instance.     The problem is as follows: As you probably know, when a file is divided two new files are created, for example STE 001A and STE 001B. The problem is that a loud popping/spike sound is added to the end of file STE 001A where the file has been divided.  Some units work fine at 16 Bit depth but NOT at 24.  Other units have the problem at BOTH bit depths.  The problem also occurs dividing Mp3 Files.    A total of FIVE units tested all had the problem (2 tested by me, 1 tested by the retailer's Tech Support, and 2 units tested by Samson Technology Corp., Zoom's USA Distributor - who forwarded sound clips of the problem to Zoom Tech Support)    Zoom has been made aware of the problem and will hopefully have a Firmware fix but as of Firmware Update 1.72 it is not yet fixed.    I have had my eye on the H4n for several years. Prior to purchasing I not only read every review on Sweetwater, Musician's Friend, Amazon, and Harmony Central, I also read through several online Zoom H4n User Forums, the Zoom H4n User's Guide and website and never once found any mention of a problem on something so basic as the DIVIDE function.     I like the Zoom H4n.  One of the reasons I chose Zoom over its competitors is because I was impressed with its record of Firmware updates, FAQs, and online support materials. Zoom seems to be a company really committed to its products and I respect that.  And besides this issue the H4n is clearly impressive.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Non-skippable trailers are common nowadays, but this movie had the longest advertising intro I've come across - even worse than Disney movies. Not even the 'stop' button worked. Adding insult to injury, the movie froze part way in, and my DVD player has to be rebooted, forcing us to watch the trailers again. At least fast-forward helped us through the second round.    The advertising feature for the Orlando theme park is a real deterrent to repeat viewing of the DVD.
B003L77GG0|4.0|I just saw the last two episodes of Smallville they mostly talked threw the hole show there were no real fight scene's and to top it off we really didn't see  him in his superman close's and if we did it was from far away. I think they could have done a better job for the last episode they were suppose to have darkside on there and trust me dark side looks nothing like what they had on the show he really didn't even fight superman. They only showed Green Arrow for like 15 seconds then the talking part was like 30 minutes I seen better Superman stuff then what they did, Superman Returns and Justice League did way better job's then that, Im sorry I watch Smallville for a long time but the episode was not that good, for any show to have a last episode it dosen't matter if its Icarly,Ben 10 or 24 you make sure the last episode is the best.
B004XWLN20|1.0|Haven't bought the season collections in blu-ray because I've waited on the series collection. DVD doesn't cut it in this day & age. If you don't release this in blu-ray, count me out.
0316056863|4.0|I have always been an adoring fan of Tina Fey, so me reading this book was as inevitable as Tina Fey writing a book.  It was just bound to happen.    I did come into this read with high expectations because I, and many other people, believe that Tina is at the top of the female comedian hierarchy.  She is consistent, does not harp on her gender and is not afraid to show imperfections.  And she's freakin' hilarious.  But this book never really seemed to enthrall me and take a chokehold on my attention like I had hoped it would.  I was waiting for the moment when I would rather continue reading about something so entertaining that I wouldn't have moved for an oncoming rhino or something of an equal intimidation level.  Throughout the entire book, I felt like I was right on the verge of getting really into her stories.  I was so damn close and it just didn't happen.  Granted, I still did read the book and I was never bored or severely disappointed, but I was hoping that, at some point, she would leave her comfort zone and really shock me.      If you're a fan of Tina Fey and know her work well, then I would say read this.  You'll probably still love it because Tina is articulate and does divulge information about 30 Rock and other works of hers that cannot be obtained anywhere else.  But don't expect the next great memoir or you'll pout for hours after finishing it like I did.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|we watched this movie together at home and i had no idea what an impact it made on her. her mom and dad called me to ask what she was talking about, with this \\"hairspray\\". to top it off, i had it gift wrapped and you would have thought i had hung the moon! AWESOME
0545123275|4.0|The only reason why this one gets 4 & not 5 stars is because it dragged for a bit too long for me. Although the things that took place before the story picked up (somewhere way in the middle), were not boring or pointless, it just seemed to miss a few opportunities to get the ball rolling quicker so to speak. That is my only complaint with this book..<br /><br />Everything involving the premise, the characters, the plot, their plight was beyond intriguing & heartbreaking. This is such a beautiful story. It touches on so many things dealing with life, love, & courage. Fear, selfishness & forgiveness. The love story between Sam & Grace was just 2 beautiful to describe. The obstacles & uncertainty these 2 endure is just frightening. And it made me @ times want to whine like a baby and say \\"it's not fair\\"! All things considered & with everything these 2 had to go through I would say they handled it way better than I would have.<br /><br />Grace and her realtionship with her parents really irked the heck out of me. How could u be so involved with ur own lives that u all but ignore ur child completely? The fact that Sam was living in their house for what over a month and they had no clue he was there. Their interactions with Grace were few and far between. And when they did happen, it was so on the surface they might as well just all been roommates anyway. I mean I have seen Aunts and Uncles more involved/invested with their nieces & nephews than these two were with their own daughter. Sadly this goes on way 2 often and the way this and Grace's other relationships with friends & especially Sam were woven into this story was done very well. It makes u think. Consider things more closely and open urself up. That's what I think I loved the most about this one. And of course the sweet, bittersweet, crazy, scary, & sometimes sexy interactions with Grace & Sam.. Okay I loved all of their interactions. Just read this one. I highly recommend it. I'm starting book 2 tonight!
0071752854|5.0|Oren Klaff has a dazzling ability to clearly describe some new methods for presenting ideas .<br /><br />As he displays in this entertaining and illuminating look at how we pitch deals --ideas, projects or even ourselves --he can parse for general readers the intricacies of fascinating but little-known methods like Prizing (eg. why should you never ask for the deal). Klaff's conclusion, after studying how people make decisions in a wide range of situations from the boardroom to the common coffee shop meeting, is that we can make better pitches  by never being needy, by elevating our status with something called local star power--and that less information (as long as it's the right information) is better than more.<br /><br />Perhaps the most stunning example he gives of this counterintuitive truth is the time he faced off with a powerful hedge fund manager, in which the rich and powerful banker tried to ignore Klaff during a deal, yet the author was able to reframe the situation in a surprising way. This incident, by the way, is worth the price of admission for the book.<br /><br />But if one sets aside Klaff's dazzle, some questions emerge. If pitching is an algorithm, or formula, such as Klaff's method, in which only a few steps are needed to get a deal into the waiting arms of an investor or buyer, is that really increasing your ability--or is it taking it out of your hands altogether and handing it over to the algorithm? Still, each case study in the book is satisfying, and Klaff imparts his own evident pleasure in finding new methods that have not been used before and seeking the best possible way to pitch every deal.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A retelling of the classic tale- I loved it.  Acting, directing, music; all top-notch.  This is one I'll watch over and over.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing. The best in the movie series thus far. I have watched it multiple times since receiving it, and continue to watch it. There are so many amazing scenes. The dark lighting set to the movie set the tone and the mood that is needed for this film. Comparing to the book they did a pretty good job, only those who are paying attention to the most minute of details will notice the missing things. If you don't read the books then you will be okay. Even if you do, you will be happy with this movie. It is a very interactive movie with your emotions.
B000VI6T6K|5.0|If you're on this page, then you're probably already a Hendrix fan, so you have a pretty good idea of the insanely chaotic and beautiful energy he can unleash when he plays his instrument.The thing to know about this album, however, is that it's the best live album in the Hendrix catalogue, and possibly the best live album ever.    In my opinion, the original lineup of the Jimi Hendrix Experience (Hendrix on guitar, Mitch Mitchel on drums, and Noel Redding on bass guitar) is by far superior to his later Band of Gypsys. While Billy Cox of the Gypsys mainly concerns himself with repititive grooves, Mitchel's drumming is more energetic and propulsive, and altogether much more \\"rock\\", like his fellow Brits Ginger Baker of Cream and Keith Moon of The Who. Redding and Miles are different in the same way.    Most of the songs on this album are fast and extremely loud. The opener, \\"Killing Floor\\" is a thrashy, proto-metal rocker while the finale, \\"Wild Thing\\", with its droning feedback ending, is a precursor to noise rock. I'm not sure, but I think that's the part of the show where he lights his guitar on fire.    I seem to hear Jimi Hendrix's later live stuff praised more for being more \\"natural\\" and Blues-oriented. One review I read a while ago even brought his race into the issue, asserting that earlier noise-heavy shows were degrading to his fellow black musicians. I had never read something more stupid written so eloguently in a music review. It's a classic case of critics worshipping the Blues and crapping on Heavy Metal.    Anyway, as a Metal fan I prefer \\"Live at Monterey\\".
B000LB7G00|1.0|When you move the knob up, forward, or backward, the whole device moves off/across the desk. (i.e. It's too light for the resistance of the knob.) I find myself trying to hold the base down with my pinky and ring finger while moving the knob with the others, which is very awkward. This is true even when it's at the most sensitive (fastest) setting. I can't imagine how the lighter laptop version works. I'll be returning it.
B001EOOQF6|5.0|In an interview that was posted on youtube some time ago, Ronnie James Dio claimed that the experience of making the Mob Rules was not like the one during the making of \\"Heaven and Hell\\". Dio seems to have nothing but good things to say about the Heaven and Hell experience. The Mob Rules was not so kind and experience, and it eventually resulted in Dio being asked to leave the Black Sabbath. Too bad that's the impression many who saw the interview are left with about this album, because it's an outstanding piece of work. For me, it's an effort as important in the Black Sabbath canon as the albums \\"Black Sabbath\\" and \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\"; as musical creations, these albums elevated Black Sabbath to heights that were greater than their contemporaries. Mob Rules is without a doubt the heaviest Black Sabbath album in years. Indeed, it's heavier than a lot of other metal acts of that era. Just as ACDC and Van Halen were beginning to enjoy their commercial success, and their interest in maintaining it, Black Sabbath took the other route and made an album that was meant to be played loud and hard. The production is thick and relentlessly overpowering. Kudos to Geezer Butler's earthquake inducing bass riffs. Tonni Iomi's guitar has never sounded more dense and threatening. But don't forget Dio's vocals. There are Herculean in their strength and intensity. This album is all about power, and there is no band more powerful than Black Sabbath.
0618918248|5.0|With The God Delusion, Dawkins writes a clear, interesting, and thorough indictment of religion. Contrary to those who state that he words it too harshly, I found his writing to be clear, comprehensible, and often laced with gentle humor at just the right moment. While his argument is logical, he deftly keeps it from being dry or boring.    One of the very points that he brings up in the book is the concept that religion should for some unknown reason be immune from criticism. As one might imagine, Dawkins vigorously dissents from this viewpoint and asserts that religion should be just as subject to criticism as any other idea or concept.    And criticize he does. I would advise both theist and atheist readers to read this title. It is not a bad thing to ask \\"Is what I think defensible? Is it correct? How should I reexamine it?\\" Though I had already long since drifted away from the idea of any gods existing by the time I read this, it does make clear what is at stake, and how religion can be actively harmful on both an individual and societal level. It also examines the assertions that religion can be beneficial.    If you don't want to think, by all means avoid this book. If you would like what you think to be challenged (and Dawkins has challenges for atheist and theist alike), I would strongly advise that you read it. The one thing I took away from the book is something I hope we can all agree on: Critically examining our thoughts and beliefs, and changing them if they are indefensible, is necessary for us to become better people. We should never accept \\"Because I said so\\".
B001EUPD7A|5.0|I'm a late-bloomer in catching up with music. I was introduced to TON by a former friend as I was curios and also I'm a huge SLAYER fan.   The first time I heard \\"Love You To Death\\", \\"Slow, Deep, & Hard\\", & \\"Green Man\\" I was absolutely amazed. Dark, deep, morbid, and full of emotion, these tracks drew me in as they were brilliantly written. How did I miss out on this amazing album is beyond me.     R.I.P. Peter Steele (1962-2010). You're finally at peace.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've tried numerous headphones and I must say that this pair are the best balance of sound quality, comfort and price. The sound is excellent for the price, and are extremely comfortable. I also also own also a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 PRO which were just too tight for my [large?] head. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a good pair for closed, over the ear, well priced, and comfortable set of headphones.
B000003C5C|5.0|this was the 2nd album i heard of theirs & i must say damn, i'm proud to own this masterpiece. bad ass solos & chucks vocals are great, they mix well together perfectly. the title track & pull the plug are my favorites from this. highly recommended album. R.I.P. chuck. this album is an absolute must have for any deathmetal fan out there =D
0312430000|3.0|Sometimes a book gives you one small piece that's just exactly what you're looking for at that moment.  This book was it.  I got it because I was trying to find a solution to a productivity problem and was expecting another productivity book laying out the rules of what you were supposed to do.  Instead, I got a book chronicling a doctor's journey through finding a checklist that could reduce errors in surgery for the World Health Organization.  The doctor ventures in other businesses to explore what checklists have done for people there and finds ones that save money and save lives.  The airline industry uses checklists for all the things the pilot might forget but needs to be done.    The book is largely ancedotal, which I like because gives a hands-on feel to the book.  Each time we're introduced to a new story, we get a new perspective on how checklists can be used.  Where it gets the 3-star instead of 4-star is because it doesn't give much in the way of examples of checklists!  I originally got this in hardback from the library, and there weren't any in the book at all.  But I bought the paperback, and there were three in the appendix at the end. I would have much preferred to see these in the book where they were discussed so I could match up what I was discovering to what the author had discovered.  I also wanted more examples, maybe even some showing the early drafts of the checklists where it didn't work right, because that's a learning, too.    Overall, it's a fascinating book that presents the story as it unfolded and lets us judge for ourselves how to use the tools.
0765357151|3.0|I Am Legend aired on television and although I've seen the movie before I didn't realize it was based on a book. That's what prompted me to order it. I loved reading the book and seeing the differences in it compared to the movie; however, the movie was 100 percent better. The ending was dry and disappointing, and I didn't understand the unrelated stories at the end.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I bought this album a couple months ago and still listen to it on a regular basis and many of the songs over and over.  Love it!
B00503BN1M|3.0|True, I'd just finished watching the terrible film, Life As We Know It, and so my expectations were in the Pits of Hell but still...this was much better than I expected. Natalie Portman and Ashton had very little credible chemistry but the film was still pretty good. I did smile a few times and they were both individually charming.
0375842209|5.0|This book is one of those that you reflect on at times when you least expect it. It creeps into your own language about life and death in that way. I laughed, I cried, I recommend.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|This is my first time ever posting a review so I have to say that the series finale blew me away. They had a lot to wrap up in a brief period of time and did it all so well. Smallville has been around long enough to go through some definite changes over the years. I started watching the series at about season 3 and was pretty much hooked. After waiting for this character to be able to fly for almost a decade (but well knowing the show would end as soon as that happened - so bittersweet), I have to say that it met all my expectations. I have to commend Tom Welling for driving this series to an explosive conclusion. I really don't think there is another actor who could have pulled it off like this. I'm glad they wrapped up multiple story lines that tie so well into the actual comic and movie universe that has come before. It happens quickly and definitively and it was awesome. The show was full of action and emotion and movie quality effects and acting. Kudos to the FX team...just wow...watch it and I think you'll agree. They also took no liberties that take away anything from the actual mythology and this comes from a person who has read a lot of Superman comics. I won't spoil anything for anyone reading this but I'll say if you are a true comics and movie fan of the superman mythology, you'll see countless nods to the source material here which I thought was great. The little flashbacks they had that kind of recapped the entire series during the two hour long finale was nice too. I'm sure the same people who complained about not having enough Venom in the Spider-Man movies will complain about one particular aspect of the finale but I actually like how they did it. Prolonging it would have cheesed things up. Kudos to the cast...You will all be missed. Thanks for ten years of what will go down in my mind as one of the definitive Superman-based series. Incredible...would love to see a movie in the future folks. Thanks again.
B000001F29|5.0|Almost forgotten, but then I heard a memory, and the track Friends of Mr. Cairo was all I could think of, searched for it on Amazon and with lightening quick shipping I was able to relive the unbelievable concept of this track.......awesome!
B002TZ3DYY|5.0|One of the greatest skills of Alexander McCall Smith in creating this series is to subtly capture a sense of place. There is such a temptation by many writers to err on the side of presenting a stereotypical image of Africa. These stories, however, capture the nuance, the detail, the turn of phrase that are so typical of Botswana.<br /><br />Makes me homesick!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a good exercise video, I would buy it again. If I stick with it, I am sure  I will get the results I want.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|The dvd's were in perfect condition, and it came in a very timely manner.  The only thing I can complain about is the dvd case itself was broken when it arrived in the envelope.  It was still sealed in the plastic but the case itself didn't make the trip unscathed.  That aside thank you and it is an amazing set of tv episodes.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I agree with most reviews, but I am surprised that there was an old movie, sort of like a family documentary, of Alex Lifeson's family when he decided to quit school and play rock...
B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson gives a gripping performance as a former special ops, espionage James Bond type, whose daughter is kidnapped by French criminals who turn girls into prostitutes, or sell them to super-rich perverts.  His wife, who has married a rich guy, since they spit, waits in the wings while Neeson tries to recover their daughter caught in an extensive criminal enterprise.    This is an exceptional film. Enough action an emotion to satisfy anyone.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have tried many dvd workouts and have never stuck to any program due to boredom.  I LOVE this workout!!!!!  It is amazing... I am about 3 weeks in and have lost 5lbs and more importantly 10.5inches total!!!!!  I love the constant change up in the routine, you never get bored.  It is VERY hard but only 20mins... you have to keep that in mind.  You can do anything for 20mins!  It is very convenient since I have a 4month old baby and has really helped me get my body back.  I weigh less than I did before I got pregnant at this point!
B000088E6M|4.0|50 cent at his best.you can not beat having dr dre and eminem on the production.there was so much hype around 50 cent and this album backed it up.with each album 50's sale dropped and so did the creative spark.his most recent online freestyles have him rapping with the hunger that this album carried.so if you want 50 at his finest then buy this album.
B000031EGV|5.0|This is a great movie for older kids and adults.  It is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your chair.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I saw it in the theaters when it was released. The first movie since midnight opening of Two Towers where I heard everyone hooting, hollering, and w00ting.    This is a must for anyone who was age 10-25 between the years of 1982 and 1995 and can digest all it's references. Otherwise, it's still good.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The Veronica Mars series is great.  My teenage daughter, granddaughter and I love to watch it together.  It's a shame they cancelled the show after the 3rd season.  We want more!
B00122M2QU|5.0|Just as heavy as I expected, and it sticks to what metal should be. It's what I was looking for when I am in the mood for... metal. Lots of purported metal these days is just soft rocks with heavy guitars, it's good to see some real music again.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|Loved everything about the show, how they brought the old characters back, it wouldn't have been the same i don't think if Lex didn't have some part in it all. The ending was amazing such a huge high from an awesome show and such a low knowing that its the last. I have loved every season watching Clark grow up and the trials he endeavored and at the end it all came back. Thank you Smallville for great ups and downs its been a good 10 years.

B0042RUMIW|5.0|I saw Sting concerts a couple of times. I definitely wish I would have seen this one. Instead I am playing it all the time.
B002VECLVO|5.0|I had put off seeing this as there had been so much hype around it, that I felt it would not be able to live up to it all. I was happily proven wrong. This beautiful film is set in 1962, with the backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis and the first real societal awakening to the global threat of nuclear war. Whilst some people feel that man kind could be coming to an end, George (University Professor in California) played brilliantly by Colin Firth, has just lost his one true love in his boyfriend and can not see a reason to live.<br /><br />His boyfriend Jim dies in a car accident whilst visiting his parents and they do not even tell him about it. He is denied from attending the service and has to cope with living when he feels dead inside, eking out enough emotional strength through memories to sustain day to day existence. He has a best friend, who like him is an ex pat Brit Julianne Moore. She was and clearly is still in love with him and finds her strength in gin and the forlorn hope of a love rekindled with George.<br /><br />Some would call this lyrically paced, but I found it just moved along at the right speed to savour the whole thing. It is beautifully shot and stage, evoking the era in such a clear way that I got that it was the sixties immediately. There is so much attention to detail that you can tell it was a real labour of love. Tom Ford has made a film he can truly be proud of and we can be grateful to him. I often get miffed when straight actors play gay ones, when there are so many gay actors who never get a look in. However, acting is acting and if a good actor like Firth can do such an excellent job and thereby bring more attention to such a great work and story as this, then I have no problem.<br /><br />This is a truly beautiful film, with style, humour and a study in human frailty through emotions and love that I found both moving and could really empathise with. Thoroughly recommend it.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Great service - fast & speedy delivery of my NEW movie, all at a reasonable price.  FUN movie, if you haven't seen it, you've heard it. Packed with lots of Abba songs,   wonderfully and creatively choreographed in Greece and on sound stages. Don't miss  watching the director's comments - lots of behind-the-scenes insights that make this  DVD even better. ORDER IT TODAY!
B003UESJH4|4.0|My husband and I found it very good except for  some of the coarse language - but we realised  that it was all part of the therapy. Excellent  rendering by all stars in the show - Colin Firth  was tops again as he always is in whatever part  he plays. George Rush and Helena Bonham Carter  were excellent choices for their parts and I must  say it should be seen by young and old as it is  all part of our history beautifully portrayed.
B00005JL96|3.0|i got this for a little girl's birthday present but the seller sold me something so dirty and scratched up i couldn't give this to her after all. because the seller east 2 west cds took nearly a week to send it after charging my card for it ''on the day of shipment'' there wasn't time for me to cancel this and get a clean copy of her favorite movie. i have pictures of the stains and scratches, would post them if i could. be very careful of who you get your products from even if they have a (falsely?) high positive rating here. the movie itself is fun, but you shouldn't have a seller ruining what was going to be a wonderful surprise for a sweet little girl.
B000XR49VQ|5.0|I saw this movie once in its original release at the theater. I remember it being the most visually striking movie I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I wish this movie was available on VOD.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Sucks, update forces close.....not paying for an app that's not working. Love angry birds, just not happy with this version not updating right.
B003J27WFW|2.0|As a long-time RUSH fan, and an avid drummer, I thought I would've enjoyed this DVD more. The film itself is okay, but they gushed about the days with the original drummer for an extremely long time, while flying though the 1980's with little detail (especially toward the end of the 80's). The film is a good jumping-off point for the RUSH beginner. However, anyone who had recorded this film off of VH-1 Classics (like myself) will be disappointed in that the television broadcast is the same running time. There is nothing new to see here.      I mainly bought the set for the second disc with the bonus features. The features aren't very interesting. The segments with the boys having dinner was amusing, however I was expecting more concert footage from the film (the stuff that was in black and white).    I do own all of RUSH's CD's, and have most of their video releases on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD.  I can't help but feel \\"taken\\", and should have spent my money elsewhere.    This DVD set is for the new RUSH fan only. All others who own most of their other DVDs (and the book VISIONS that was released in the 1980's) would be better off saving their money.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|Comment: After watching this documentary you realize how the word \\"deregulation\\" has become synonamas with the word \\"greed\\". You are left with a feeling of helplessness... especially when you realize the same people are in place to allow this madness to reoccur all over again. The only thing that has really changed is \\"new\\" institutions that weren't affected the first time around. So... are we ready to repeat what has happened in the past, (2008) with new (meat) institutions, and the same people at the helm from 2008... only time will tell. I for one are not.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter because it had Nick Jonas in it. She takes the laptop with her everywhere so she can watch it.
B0020TS5LU|4.0|Comment: If you have seen \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" you know what I mean when I say that this is not that show. Where \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" was a series you could \\"love\\"... Gosford Park is a movie based on that premise, but you can hate it with the same enthusiasm that you love \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\". It is common, nasty, ruthless and dare I say probably closer to the truth than \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\"... or that the times became after the era of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\". The story became hard to follow, not because of the story itself... but rather the bad muffled quality of the sound during the gathering of more than one or two cast members at a time. In halls and in rooms where there is a lot of people and things going on such as a party, the dialog is frightfully muffled which makes some important facts hard to come buy. All in all it is a good movie on par with \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" but brings out a different feeling in the end.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Pretty entertaining movie.  Nice to see that Bruce Willis has still got some talent, but Helen Miren makes the show worthwhile, as does Morgan Freeman.  Enjoyed watching this movie, and of course, Amazon rocks when it comes to price and shipping costs.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Have the complete first aseason and love the characters and storylines. Big gothics fan - Dark Shadows/ Hammer movies/ Fright Night / Coppola's Dracula/ Twilight etc..  Vampire Diaries host interesting characters - vampires/witches/ werewolves etc.. You get hooked on the characters. Interesting but not gruesome. I thoroughly enjoy the series offerings and hate when they end. Also not a youngster but a grandma. Hope this keeps going for many years to come.
B003UESJHO|3.0|So - so story line. Don't know how this got nominated for best picture.  Definitely enjoyed the performance by Christian Bale, but after that.... found myself wandering away from the movie at times.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I didn't like the headphones in local stores, too bulky, too expensive. I bought this item because I have the exact headphone I've used for more than 20 years.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Don't get the latest update. Whenever it is running on my EVO, the touch screen is so sluggish it's non-responsive to anything. I even have trouble using the home button. This continues OUTSIDE the app, when it's running in the background. I managed to kill the Kindle app and suddenly it started working perfectly. I've done it a few times now, same results. This makes me sad to say.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|I wasn't sure about this CD when I read about it. I didn't care for Sorcerer and<br />the last Mac effort. I am Thrilled with this release, however....Much of it I credit Dave stewart for. Stevie needed a different direction. Her music was beginning to sound too repititve...This CD is GREAT for being Fresh. I love the package too...She looks GREAT and sounds wonderful. My fave cut from this CD is Annabelle Lee....I'm biased as a Poe fan...The single is Good also. I'd Love to see<br />her on tour. Dave Stewart has done some great work with other artists....re: Mick Jagger. He does a nice job with Stevie on an album that is not a \\"yawner\\"....<br />Rock on Stevie!<br /><br />Atreides
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Great timing on delivery, great wrapping, great quality of DVD's. I haven't seen these episodes in forever. Brought back memories, and thanks for doing that for me.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|(This is a spoiler-free review)    It's a shame that Stargate Universe was canceled just as it finally found its stride.  While the show struggled throughout its inaugeral season to find a proper direction, in season two the writing became much more focused.  The stories were far more interesting this time around and they really ramped up the character development.  Characters that had seemed rather stagnant before displayed real growth over the course of this season, especially Eli.  The show should also be praised for its top-notch visual effects and a fantastic soundtrack by composer, Joel Goldsmith (a soundtrack that I truely hope will be getting a release somewhere down the line).      If season two was any indication of where this show was going, then it's too bad that we'll be missing out on a third.  SGU will now join the ranks of the other great sci-fi shows that were canceled before their time: Firefly, Dark Angel, Farscape, Dollhouse, and well the list goes on.  Stargate Universe, we hardly knew ya...
B0050SS1EE|5.0|Seem that the first half was picking up a little slow but the finale as a whole was put together beautifully. Out of every Superman movie/tv show I have ever scene, the evolution from Clark Kent to Superman in the fanale was a WORK OF ART!!!! Sad to know that we will not be seeing this series anymore. As Jonathan Kent said...\\"Never forget Smallville\\"!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Sorry JLo's \\"LOVE?\\" and Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\", but Britney rules the game of exciting Pop/Dance tracks.  And gets Best Use of Autotune award.  I know its overprocessed, and hardly even sounds like her voice anymore, but she has that \\"it\\" factor that keeps me getting all her music album after album.  Get it, you'll love it.
B000FJGWBC|4.0|I just finished watching this movie which I bought new in a discount bin for $2.99!!!!! Yes, you read that correctly. I have been working in Bahamas for eight months and can totally relate to the beauty of the waters and overall beauty of the area. This movie with I find a great blu-ray transfer and great audio is worth a watch. The under water scenes look incredible. Yes, this is a basic remake of the classic The Deep with Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset (which I also have the Blu Ray) and not quite the same film, but who cares. If you love the Bahamas, incredible scenery, incredible underwater images, drop the crap, and buy this Blu Ray!!!!
0312330537|5.0|This is one of the best books that I've ever read in my life.  The author's story is captivating, his characters jump off the page. It has excitement, takes place in an intriguing foreign land, romance, danger, humanity, humility - literally all of the ingredients of an exceptional read. It also does a terrific job of weaving in the culture of India.  I was so sad to be finished with the book. I've heard that Johnny Depp has purchased the movie rights and I am truly looking forward to getting to experience this story again on the big screen! Definitely read this book, you will not be disappointed!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Ah-mazing album, its truly one of the best albums i have heard in a while, Lady gaga doesn't need to be a hot pop star all she needs is her creativity and vocal talent to succeed!
160059672X|5.0|This book really has inspired me into creating with bead embroidery.  It is simple, fun and beautiful.  There is nothing like bead soup.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|First thing's first: unlike what some would say, I doubt this is a cash-grab with all the vintage programs on disc 9.     That said, being young as I am, Star Wars is Star Wars to me. I doubt i'll really be too convinced to enjoy the original theatricals(if they were included, which they're not) that much more than the Special Editions. Same movies; different cuts. Saying otherwise is like saying the extended version of LOTR, Beauty and the Beast, Harry Potter, etc are entirely different movies from their theatrical versions. I recognize the need to put out the theatrical cuts as an option because most fans want that nostalgic value(even though nostalgia *can* blind one's judgement, but not always), but as an aspiring filmmaker, I also see the artistic intent Lucas was striving for......that he would've done in 77 if given the chance. an artist is never satisfied with his work. Yes, filmmaking can be just as much an art as painting. And HELLO! The guy practically co-founded Pixar. Actually, Pixar's a spin-off of the old Lucasfilm Computer Division. Well, that's something done right. Yes, I am far from the type to attack any filmmaker just because I dont like a movie or a certain cut of a movie. I instead criticize the movie and try to think of ways in which it could've been better. I recognize flaws but dont easily get turned off by them, and I honestly dont like having to rush to the defense of someone because another person who knows nothing about the industry storms in and claims he can do better. Yes, I'm sick of the constant moaning that seems to be making a dent in Lucas's brain just about as much as Capitalists care about the common people, but I just move on. There's more to life.     I love star wars, but until I really see the theatrical cuts, I could honestly care less about them. Same great story; Same memorable characters. LOVE the scene where yoda tries to whack R2 with a stick. The non-CGI FX are still wonderful. I'm just tired of hearing the same complaints over and over again. If more people complained to this extent about government, America would actually be getting somewhere rather than teetering on the edge of a cliff.
044024367X|1.0|I found this book on the laundry room bookshelf last night. It's going back this morning. It's this sort of dreck that is putting me off reading. These \\"franchised\\" characters are so formulaic and Pavlovian. Always a \\"damaged\\" veteran of war, some super-secret government agency (hint! hint!), or some inner-city police force. And ALWAYS A BAD-ASS!. Somehow, in their \\"tragic\\" past, they had time to study any and all forms of martial arts, survival skills, weaponry and philosophy. This silly bit of business avoids all attempts at allegory and just goes directly to two towns named HOPE and DESPAIR. And wouldn't you just know it? They are right next to each other! Every one in HOPE is nice and helpful and has no qualms about a 6'2\\", 250 pound drifter hanging around town wearing a janitor's clothes and buying trash bags at odd hours of the night. Least of all the beautiful female police officer, who does everything but purr and rub against his leg, 2 minutes after meeting him at the city limits. It was not long after this unlikely \\"plot twist\\" that this book was launched across the room. I absolutely KNEW how this book was going to end, having read too much of this drivel in the past. If this is what passes for a \\"best-seller\\" these days perhaps we need to raise the bar a little.
B003EW4KAW|5.0|This review is for thr SHM-SACD from Japan. Absolutely stunning transfer, very detailed, and very analogue sounding. It has a very open soundstage. Highs that are silky and lows that are authoritve without being boomy. It is very pricey-about a tanks worth of gas at 2011 prices. I would not recomend this if you have the other SACD version as it will not be enough of an improvement to be cost effective. Vinyl owners may want to think twice as this is just trying to match that sound. I don't know if the special plastics and inks really help any - but something is working right. A lot is probably due to higher quality standards. And, oh yeah- the packaging is first rate - even if I can't read any of it(it's in Japanese).Also, I'm sure this will turn out to be a good investment as the prices should skyrocket as soon as this goes out of print.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I have the HTC Hero, got the free game from another site and thoroughly enjoyed it.   Found the and paid for it from amazon app store.

I've tried the suggestions of others on this site, but cannot find an &quot;android_secured&quot; file on my phone.  I have almost 40mg available on the phone and over 700 mg on my SD card.  Why do I not have enough space on my phone?  Can someone help me, please?  Thanks!

B004WMKXWM|4.0|It's a DVD. It played. Good enough for me.    As for the movie itself, no comment. My wife's the Harry Potter fan.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this for my camera and on the go which works as intended. It also worked with my keyboard, bonus!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm suspect about overly hyped books because I'm always the one who never has any effect when drinking the kool-aid.  That is, I'm always the who never likes what everyone seems to like. But now, I think the immunity to the kool-aid has worn off.  This book is awesome!  By far, one of the best books I've read in a long, long time.  I was hooked from the very beginning and I could not put this down.  The story was engaging, exciting, heartwarming, entertaining and well crafted.  I can't say enough about this book that, by now, no has written about.  So glad I finally listened to everybody who like this book.  I can't wait to read the next two books of this trilogy.  I am at the edge of my seat...
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I pre-ordered this DVD and waited not so patiently for it to arrive. I watched it three times in two days and I love it! I know it's the beginning of the story and the next half will come on July 15, 2011, but this was a great beginning. The realization has come to Harry that everyone around him is in danger and he wants to protect them. But he also knows he can't do it alone. He has people that want to help and need to help if he is going to succeed. I laughed a little and I cried. Just a good movie. I can't wait for HP7.2 in July, but I don't really want it to end, either!
B00006L9X7|1.0|I got it in the mail, a used version of singing in the rain DVD.   correct label but would not play in my dvd player.   I was informed this was a \\"mid east/africa\\" version and invited to return for a refund.  How did that get into North America???  I'm sure when it was returned it was sent to the next guy who maybe doesn't test them all right away like I do.   I've had 4-5 errors like this is less than 2x this many transactions from Amazon, I'm done buying DVD's from them.
B004G6009U|5.0|I guess over the years I've gotten really spoiled by Pixar.<br />With the exception of the Shrek movies I tend to shy away from other animated movies.<br />I was curious enough to rent Tangled since it was based on a Bro's. Grimm story.<br />I was hoping Disney would do the story justice and...they did.<br />Excellent characters, they all developed at a fast and interesting pace.<br />Excellent story telling.<br />Direction, art, animation were all beautifully done.<br />The one thing I really don't like about old Disney films is the constant singing.<br />That's probably why I like the Pixar movies better but thankfully Disney toned down the singing this time around with more humor.<br />Heck even the songs themselves were funny.<br />I loved this movie and will be buying the 3D version.<br />Highly recommended.

B001C4CI8U|4.0|While I like this series, I must say the early episodes overused an immersion tank as a kind of aquatic ouija board whereby agent Dunham contacted her \\"dead\\" partner for new leads. When she started taking dips not once but twice an episode, things were out of control. That darn tank was seeing more traffic than Hugh Hefner's hot tub. Eventually, the writers wised up and moved on to other props.
0525951652|1.0|I didn't get the chance to read this book because I never received it.  Do not buy anything from Book Time 123.  They just take the money and never ship the book.
B004X0XA82|5.0|I have listened to this album many times and it gets better with every listen.To get maximum enjoyment and pleasure it should listened to from start to finish like a good book.Like most music it will not appeal to everyone but for those whom like it the pleasure will be heavenly.

B003MOHX8S|4.0|INVINCIBLE - TWO STEPS FROM HELL  4.4 OUT OF 5.0 STARS)  This is an excellent collection of very, very good music!  It's very professional, and the music is trully .... EPIC!!  i only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because i feel that the music tracks   were way toooooo short!  all the music sound tracks are somewhere   between 1 minute long and up to 3 minutes long!  that's it!   BUT there is only 1 track that is actually a respectable 4 minutes long!   this is my only major criticism .... the tracks' length is too short!  BUT it's a great collection of music with pure EPIC quality tunes!  And believe me, when i say this about the music in this INVINCIBLE album:  \\"This music is trully .... EPIC!!\\"  -- mac
B00005JPFH|4.0|Personally, I liked SpiderMan 3. The characters were more thoroughly developed in this script. I'm not emotionally attached to the series so I can overlook any flaws. Just relax and enjoy the movie.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Love it.  Have only watched one segment as it runs for couple of hours, but it is first class photography.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Got the may update, and every time I launch the game, I get a popup saying that there is a problem with the appstore, and to reinstall the game, which can be done no other way than to uninstall and lose all progress. Emailed amazon, and was told to reinstall the appstore. Did that, still doesn't work. Weird thing is, the game seems to be running fine under the popup, which makes me think that it's an amazon issue, not rovio. Why the game has to be tied to the appstore to run is beyond me, but it's obnoxious.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This is one of the best movies of 2010 and it looks even better in bluray. If you try to picture everything as part of a real computer like the first Tron, then it doesn't make a lot of sense. But it's an incredible movie anyway. The special effects are so much better than most blockbusters and you are really transported to a different world. Best scene is the lightcycles (could've used more). Only drawback, Disney doesn't sell blurays by themselves. You have to spend a little more for their movies since they all come with the DVD also.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|&quot;Refresh my apps&quot; isn't working. Tried it a hundred times on my Samsung Mesmerize. Is anyone else experiencing this? Any ideas?

B00005NRO3|1.0|I will never buy from this seller again. First of all when he sends my product he sends the wrong thing. Second when I tried to contact him about exchanging it 4 the right one or just returning it he never contacts me or replies to my emails. So now Im stuck with a product I didn't even want from him.
1439102724|5.0|I was at an event with Jodi Picoult last year where she talked about a book that she was writing, a book about a same-sex couple who were fighting for the right to have a baby. That book is Sing You Home, and when I picked it up to read it that is all I knew, and all I wanted to know about the book, because to me any more information is a spoiler.<br /><br />If you're not read any of Jodi's books before then you are missing out. She is one of my favourite authors and Sing You Home ranks as one of her best novels. I love the way that Jodi writes, and the way she manages to make the voices of her characters so distinct. She switches characters throughout the novel and though they all write in the first person I never have a moment of confusion as to who's voice I am listening to.<br /><br />As with most of Jodi's novels Sing You Home explores extremely sensitive and controversial topics, in a way that makes you ask \\"what would you do?\\" This time Jodi poses hard-hitting questions about sexuality and the rights of gay and lesbian couples, frozen embryos and whether they should be treated as property or children, and religious beliefs  and the part they play in the way people wish to be treated, and the way they treat others.<br /><br />I know I'm reading a good book when I find myself imploring the characters to take a certain action, and when I can't put the book down because I'm desperate to discover which path they choose to take.<br /><br />Sing You Home is one of those books.<br /><br />It's heart-breaking, it's optimistic, it's fretful and enlightening but overall it's just a wonderful read and worth every one of the five stars I've awarded it!
B004NSULHM|4.0|This is the most beautiful & haunting Radiohead album since KidA, The King Of Limbs being the liter one in mood. As other reviewers have stated this album does in fact reveal its layers through repeated listens.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I purchased this movie for my grandchild, and she loves it so much that she watches it a couple times and day.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Yes, it features perhaps the biggest Hollywood icon of our generation in the lead, but The American is very much a subtle, european exploration of the much fabled hitman genre.  George Clooney is Jack, an expert hitman on the run, laying as low as he can in the country hillsides of Italy.  There, his past, present, and future all collide in an exploration of how a man comes to terms with his soul, glimpsing a future he had never before thought to examine.<br /><br />While many have called this film flat out boring, the truth is The American is filmed, set, and narrated much in the tradition of mid 1900's european films.  What does that mean?  Symbolism over sensational violence.  Very few characters, singular plot lines driven to help the main character find his transformative way.  Indeed, if you're looking for 10 cool guys/girls to weave a storyline in 10 different directions, this is not your film.<br /><br />Simply put, this film plays out much like a novel.  Hitman novels, in fact, for years have been a subgenre of amazing acclaim yet little mainstream fanfare.  The American will remind you more of classic assassin books like 'Stiletto', Thomas Perry's 'The Butcher's Boy', or even Lawrence Block's \\"Hitman\\" series than recent films like 'The Machinist\\" (remake)or \\"Lucky number slevin\\"<br /><br />That being said, I'm not sure i've ever seen a film carry a more novelistic feel, and it serves as an amazing canvas for an actor of Clooney's calibre to articulate a character filled with inner angst, mentally and cerebrally powerful, yet emotionally vulnerable.  A subtle yet outstanding performance that in the Taoist sense gives us \\"action through nonaction\\"

0823095223|5.0|I was not only surprised by the information this book offers, but amazed at the level of professionalism that it offers private people who sculpt and hunger for this kind of information.  Various clays are described that are unusual and can be baked in your own kitchen oven.  The beauty of the figures are inspirational.  I can't recommend this book to sculptors who like doing figure work highly enough!
B002JWD6AS|2.0|So, word of mouth has failed me.  This book was a recommend from a random girl at the library who told me it was her FAVORITE book in the whole entire world.  *sigh*  After reading it, I feel out of touch with the whole genre.  Maybe I'm too old to read YA fiction.  Maybe the time has come for me to give it up.  Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater did not start out well.  First of all, it was really slow.  Nothing was really drawing me into the story.  Usually, by the 4th chapter or so, there is an obvious storyline that is pulling you along, keeping you reading.  I put this book down a bunch of times, thinking, \\"This is not that great.\\"  But I stuck it out, because it was someone's favorite book.  Then I got to page 63.  This chapter is told from the male protagonist's viewpoint.  \\"I was a leaking womb bulging with the promise of conscious thoughts...\\"  Um... WHAT?  Did you seriously just compare your supposedly hot main character to a woman's menstruating womb???  I've read some weird metaphors before.  I once read a book where Toni Morrison compared a woman's tongue to a wagging dog penis.  But it wasn't like she was a main character.  It wasn't like we were supposed to think she was this sexy, stunning wolf boy. I can't believe this book got through TWO editors without either of them saying, \\"Hey, you might not want to compare your main character to a bleeding uterus.\\"  Shame on Abby Ranger and David Levithan.  SHAME.  This was just a perfect example for me of the author doing what she does consistently in this book which is go waaaay over the top with the descriptive language.  Now, let me clarify.  I LOVE prose.  I LOVE descriptive language.  Have you ever read a Barbara Kingsolver book?  Chock full of the stuff.  But she knows where to stop.  Comparing your main character to a bloody uterus is someone who doesn't get the fine line between prose and \\"purple prose\\".  Second thing about this book that bothered me: It had several conflicts that never really did anythingmuch whatsoever.  Usually when you read a book, you get a conflict right away.  This book has several elements that could have been the conflict for the story.   -We have Shelby, werewolf obsessed with the main guy and dangerously crazy.  But other than one big scene involving her, she isn't really mentioned and nothing really happens with her storyline  -We have Jack, newly turned and savage.  There could have been a great story element involving his rehabilitation and introduction to the new world he lives in.  But no, again, he is barely mentioned except for a few key scenes, then fades away from the story.  -Then there is the \\"cure\\" for lycanthropy, which to me is the least well explained element in the story.  I find it hard to believe that the characters had to resort to the ends they did in the book.  There are plenty of ways to accomplish the same thing without the craziness they did.  The third and fourth things about the book that bothered me were related, so I'm combining them.  Have you ever watched a TV show with a teen protagonist and even if the parents start out being ultra cool and involved, over time the show fades them out into these sort of \\"half parents\\" who don't seem to give a crap what their kids are up to, don't seem to ever be around because they're BUSY, and generally don't parent at all?  These are those parents.  And despite the fact that many of these shows exist and are watched by millions, I find it hard to believe that even THOSE parents would be as clueless as THESE parents.  Their daughter is attacked by wolves, and they don't care.  She is off with their cars at all hours of the day and night and they don't care.  She skips school to hang out with her boyfriend and they don't care.  Her boyfriend starts LIVING IN THEIR HOUSE and somehow they have no idea???  This is just an obvious way for the author to let her characters get up to whatever business they want without having to worry about the parents getting in the way.  And it doesn't work AT ALL for the plot.   And the way Grace and Sam HANG all over each other, like RichandAmy from Zits may be highly amusing in a comic strip satire way, but only serves to drag this storyline down to adolescent in the most alarming fashion.  Love is great, really, but this is ridiculous and only a hormone filled teenage girl could take any of this seriously.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This movie is about an internet prodigy, and also about the founding of Facebook. The ironic part of the film is the breakup scene that is in the begining.
0525951652|5.0|I have absolutely no idea how good a book this is to read.  Interesting that there is such a split between one and five stars.  As a listen-to, however, it earns far higher than the top number of stars available.  John Lee is the reader who, if he recorded the Manhattan phone book, say circa 1962, would have the listener, on getting to the end of the Js, be excited about going on to the Ks, wondering what will happen next, and becoming quite despondent on getting to the Xs.  Or, if it were John Lee's voice/style giving navigational directions, I could quite happily drive from point A where I live in Pennsylvania to point B in New Jersey via Vancover - and pay scant attention to how long the trip was taking.  Good reason to always carry my passport...just in case.
0743486285|4.0|The tales of sex, drugs and RandR become somewhat repetitive, but there aren't that many junky rock star diaries out there, and the behind the scenes peeks are interesting. No need to be a fan to enjoy this; the only Crue song I like is Home Sweet Home.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|After a quiet decade, In Your Dreams arrives out of the blue, an absolute gem. There are echoes of Rhiannon and Landslide, but the music, lyrics, and production are 2011, and not a retro regurgitation of the past. The album begins with a journey through \\"hyper-romantic\\" (from RS) tales, reflective and hopeful, then finishing with quiet poetry. A fantastic album. Congrats and thanks to Stevie.
B004L49K20|5.0|There is not a song in this album that you will not like.  It's like Duran Duran finally found their way back to their sound, the sound that made them a great band.  If you are a Duran Duran fan, you must have this album.  If you are not but you like good music, you got to have it to.  Buy it now.

All the songs on here are fantastic, and the mellow songs on this album are superb with outstanding David Byron vocals. \\"Tales\\" is one my all time favorite Uriah Heep songs....this whole album is highly recommended by me.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Which would you want more? A bat-man tv series or a superman tv series. Each would chronichle that hero's origins. Apperently the awnswer was a Superman series (which seemed much more intresting than chronicling batman!). So quickly they set up an excellent cast, Tom Welling (Clark Kent) Kristin Kreuk (Lana Lang) Miachel Rosenbaum (Alexander \\"Lex\\" Luthor) Sam Jones III (Pete Ross) Allison Mack (Chloe Sullivan) Annette O, Toole (Martha Kent, who had origanilly played Lana Lang in Superman III) and John Snchneider (as Jonathen Kent). They assembled the Pilot episode and BANG! There's another excellent series. The episodes are:<br />  *Pilot*<br />  *Metamorphis*<br />  *Hothead*<br />  *X-Ray*<br />  *Cool*<br />  *Hourglass*<br />  *Craving*<br />  *Jitters*<br />  *Rouge*<br />  *Shimmer*<br />  *Hug*<br />  *Leech*<br />  *Kinectic*<br />  *Zero*<br />  *Nicodemus*<br />  *Stray*<br />  *Reaper*<br />  *Drone*<br />  *Crush*<br />  *Obscura*<br />  *Temptest*<br /><br />Among my favorites are *X-Ray*, *Zero*, *Obscura*, *Stray*, and *Cool*.

0743486285|5.0|I was skeptical going in, as despite being a mild Motley Crue fan, I didn't know much of Nikki.  A friend recommended this book to me and after reading a few pages in the book store, I found myself sitting on the floor completely taken in.  I immediately came home, jumped on Amazon and ordered with due haste.  This is by far one of the most interesting books i've ever read.  Top 3 favorite books of all time.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Who knew that the drummer of Nirvana would one day become the lead singer and guitarist of one of the most popular rock bands of the 21st century? Dave Grohl has come a long way from living under Kurt Cobain's shadow, which begs me to wonder where he would be now if Kurt hadn't killed himself in 1994.    On Wasting Light, Grohl and co. team up with former Nirvana producer Butch Vig, and, as a result, belt out some of their best tunes to date. The songs are all melodic, sweet, contagious, and elusive, which makes this album the Foo Fighter's equivalent to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper, The Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street, or THE signature album that will define who they are a hundred years from now.    From the electrifying opening track Bridge Burning, right into the first single and one that sounds like a sequel to Best of You, Rope, the soaring Dear Rosemary, the heavy metal inspired White Limo, the strangely titled but brilliant Arlandria, Dave's self proclaimed \\"best song [he's] ever written\\" These Days, the potential hit singles Back & Forth, a song clearly about sex, and A Matter of Time, the rocking Miss the Misery, the spinetingling I Should Have Known, which features the other surviving Nirvana member Krist Novoselic on guitar, and the beautiful album closer Walk, this is Foo Fighters' best album so far!    Highly recommended    A

B000Z27HLS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie. It is definitely my favorite Jane Austen movie I have seen yet. Northanger Abbey has always been my favorite Jane Austen book and Catherine and Henry are my favorite couple and this movie just made me love them more. JJ Feild was PERFECT for Henry. Every scene he was in, he stole the show. The chemistry between Catherine and Henry was undeniable. Loved the rain scene and the horseback riding with them..so romantic! I am so glad we now have a decent movie version of NA, because it is truly a great book.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this...a lot more fun then the other Angry Birds.  The pigs are cute, but I love the birds and monkeys better.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|I literally waited for this moment for 10 years. And when they announced this was the last season, the anticipation grew.  In earlier seasons, sometimes I thought they took some of the heroic aspect away from Clark. But in season 10 they capitalized on Clark's true heroism and integrity. To me, this is what Superman is all about. I think season 10 was the best.  And the Finale capped it all off. While I had some questions about how they did a couple things, all in all, they launched Superman into his career with all the pomp and fanfare the hero deserves.  As somewhat of a side issue, I think this episode provides one answer to the age-old question of \\"Who is the best - Superman or ....?\\" It won't end the argument, but I think this makes quite the statement. And Superman was always my favorite.
B000UD08HW|4.0|The DVD is awesome but the surround sound is worthless. If You like David Gilmore this is worth it, just don't get the blu-ray get the regular DVD save your money
B004RE29WW|5.0|First off, people need to quit whining about this movie. I think it is dark, haunting, and displays the true horror of dealing with the Alien. It is bleak and depressing. It might not be award-winning, but I like  the vision most out of the series.    The reason this gets 5 stars:  The 2003 Assembly cut not only looks phenomenal, but it FINALLY sounds great. The whisper quiet scenes are fixed and the action sequences are boomy and dynamic.      I'll never really get why people hate this movie (I'll bet most haven't even seen it).
B001LRJH0U|3.0|The horrible miscasting of Renee Zellweger. Wholly unbelievable in her role as 'Yoko' to the two-man gun-toting horse-riding Beatles.<br /><br />Otherwise, this was an excellent movie. The indomitable energy that Ed Harris carries, both as performer and director, was only bolstered by the granite that is Viggo Mortensen.<br /><br />Kudos to both steely jawed actors - they were absolutely perfect in their respective roles. And notice how deep Mortensen got into his role: Check out the forehead tan line from wearing a hat. That's pure Method on display, and I'm very appreciative of it. Hardcore acting there brother.<br /><br />An old school cowboy narrative - and for me, it's never gone out of style. Harris does a sturdy job of creating the nascent explosive undercurrent that I've only seen Eastwood do better in a modern western.<br /><br />And props to Harris for hiring Lance Henriksen. It's not an understatement to say that he's been underutilized for years - forced to take paycheck jobs instead of performing for an audience who can appreciate his talents. I do wonder if Harris made friends with him during the shooting of '[[ASIN:B000092T6N The Right Stuff]]'. Not all ensemble casts end up lifelong friends, but I like to think so.<br /><br />This would've been an easy four-stars for me, but Zellweger's maddeningly oafish overacting is not something you can ignore. Her character is critical to the plot, and her plastic ingratiating performance detracts from the entire production. One has to wonder how Harris was conned into having her in the film, I suspect some serious arm-twisting. No way an actor's actor like him could've been that fooled by her ridiculously inflated resum&eacute;. The question is who put the pressure on for her hiring?
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Paul Simon's voice seems to get better with age, amazingly. And his lyrics are as always poetry, this time with emphasis on death, the afterlife, the lack of answers to the big questions and the humor in all this. Musically, lovely, with hints of African, doo-wop, folk and who knows what else in there. Great.
B002F6FQGK|4.0|I bought this album and I like this album, BUT I'm so tired of hearing how original it is. Anyone who listened to Siouxsie and the Banshees years ago can see the similarities. I'm not knocking Flo but please don't preach about how 'original' the album is. In this day and age I really don't think anyone can be original anymore. We've heard it all at one time or another. That being said I'm not trying to take anything away from the album. Its my 2nd best discovery next to Adele's 21 ;)
055357342X|5.0|My guy friends recommended this series and frankly I was reluctant to commit to reading yet another group of epic novels.  I have to admit though I was sucked in from the first chapter.  This series is a relatively easy read with a well developed storyline.  No character is safe and the intrigue is fantastic. Fantastic job in writing!
B000002H38|5.0|This is Anita Baker's introduction to the music world; her first album, The Songstress, was a hidden gem, but this album put Ms. Baker on the map, and she never left (in my humble opinion). She was pitch perfect, and she set the standard for everyone else to match.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|TAXI DRIVER is an iconic film, considered by many to be a masterpiece and the crowning achievement of both Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro.  Whatever your opinion this is a powerful film that starts strong and never lets up that has also stood the test of time.  Everything in the movie is done so realistically that the story could still be told today.  Robert  Deniro plays Travis.  We know little about him other than that he is an ex marine and a deep insomniac.  He also sees the world as a dirty place that needs to be cleaned up.  He becomes a taxi driver in the city of New York which takes on a realistic role of its own here.  We see the two sides of everything and the same goes for New York.  Nothing is held back on showing the realistic gritty underside of the city.<br /><br />But what of the transfer of this movie classic to blu ray.  Seems like all the classics are being brought to blu ray, some more succesfully than others.  The questions are always how does it look, is it an improvement over the dvd and does it bring the film to new life.  TAXI DRIVER was the first film to receive an enhanced 4k restoration and what it does is perform magic on a decades old film.  The video presentation is purely amazing.  It is funny for when the film starts the Columbia logo is very fuzzy and then the movie starts.  It is clear, crisp with colors strong.  The film is very definitive in that scenes are either nighttime or daytime, dark or light.  The blacks and dark colors are brilliant and all color ratios amazing.  Whites contrast perfectly.  No matter what the scene everything pops.  The night scenes are very realistic and when colors are introduced they are vibrant and real.  Nothing is overenhanced.  Instead the film looks the way it must have when released originally in theaters.  It is leaps and bounds over any dvd version.  The climactic scene at the end is brought to new devastating life with this new restoration.  Flesh tones are also perfect.  Blu ray is put to amazing use here restoring this classic film to all its glory.  The graininess here is meant to be here.  It represents New York City in full detail.  And the audio is just as perfect.  The DTS 5.1 audio allows the amazing soundtrack to fully blossom and soar over the entire film.  The score here tells the story as much as any character or visual.  And dialogue is strong and present.  Nothing is wrong here.  The film itself is told in a way that it is open to many different interpretations but the blu ray itself needs no debate.  It is spectacular.  I will reiterate again.  The film looks as pure and original as when in the theaters restored to its true glory.  Do not hesitate to double dip if you own the dvd.  This blu ray shows the movie as a whole new experience.  I give this blu ray my highest recommendations.amazing use here restoring this classic film to all its glory.

My wife was on the edge of her seat during the entire movie. Some of the physics discussed were a little hard to understand, but we hung in there and were stunned by the final conclusion that we had no problem understanding. It was super fantastic. This man has connected every thing up with everything else...science, religion, pyramids and ancient Egypt, Von Daniken's ideas, astronomy, etc. We enjoyed this movie so much, we watched it again a couple of days later and understood almost all of it the second time through. And it was just as enjoyable and fresh as it was the first time. If you like to learn about scientific advances, you'll love this one. And we plan on watching it at least a couple of more times as we expect to understand something new every time we watch it. We also bought four copies to give to three of our sons and a nephew who is like a son to us.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A co-worker let me borrow his CD's of this series.  By the third episode I was hooked.  I like how they added a little comedy to lighten up the story lines. Great writing and great characters. Some of the episodes have 3 story lines going on at the same time.  \\"Firefly\\" is a great ship and the design is imaginative.  I can not say enough good things about this series.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|The movie Agora, shows a time in the 300s when Pagan, Christian, and Jewish values collided. Agora meets market or nmmeting place and the story is of Hypathia, woman philosopher and resident of the rebuilt library at Alexandria, Egypt.

1439153663|1.0|This book was huge disappointment and I regret wasting my time reading it. Full of stereotypical characters - the mistress on opium, the evil overseer, the kindly slaves, there was little character development to distinguish this book from others of this genre. Sure, there was the twist of the poor little orphan girl from Ireland, but that was unrealistic as well. She eventually goes to Williamsburg to be tutored, but can't wait to get back to her slave family in Virginia. In the 1700s, seriously? It was at this point I realized the writer was out of touch with reality and I lost all interest in the characters and what happened to them.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|The film is \\"darker\\" than the TV Series, but it did fill in background information on the characters.  The writers did still leave a few characters background in the shadows.  Maybe more story line will be explored in the future.  I hope so, this series has \\"hooked\\" me like Star Trek did in the 1960's and Star Wars did in the 1970's.

1401310400|4.0|I am half way thru the book.  There are a couple of mistakes that I guess they missed during editing.  The book has a good story line.  I imagine the characters in the tv show as the characters in the book as I am reading.  I did think that I would be getting a bigger book based on the versions they show on the tv show, but this is a small paperback.  For the price, it is still worth it.  I will probably buy the second book when I finish this book.

B00165Q12Y|4.0|Was recently introduced to this album, and wow, couldn't wait to purchase it for myself!  Shirley Bassey has a gorgeous, clear voice to accompany the stellar musical production on this album.  There are touches of many music genres in this album that blend seamlessly, sound fresh, and should appeal to people of many ages.<br /><br />The sound quality is stunning even for a digital download.  This album is simply exciting and danceable, yet relaxing to listen to.  It should get you up and going, dancing, feeling romantic, or Get The Party Started as the title states.<br /><br />All in all, this album provides a personal capstone of years of exposure to a lot of amazing timeless music as well as some recent releases to my liking (not all noted here on Amazon).  Many elements sparking fond memories can be found in this album; the producers pulled out all the stops!

B0000AC8N4|5.0|Probably the best Dexter album in the world. No saxophonist has ever been as swinging as Dexter. Pierre Michelot fine and boring. Kenny Clarke fine and oldfashioned. Bud Powell on a fine day. But DEXTER: His \\"Scrapple from the Apple\\" is better than Charlie Parker's - and that's not possible.
B003UESJH4|4.0|THE KING'S SPEECH may not be a truly great film but it comes close. The acting is splendid, the costumes well-researched, the background score including some classic pieces of Mozart and Beethoven is inspiring, and Tom Hooper's direction is admirable.<br /><br />What hampers the film is the fact that its protagonist, a stuttering man (Colin Firth) who must ascend the throne when his brother (Guy Pearce) abdicates, is really quite a dull man with a fierce temper and an inability to express himself as a person until he meets the challenge of a speech therapist. But for all his courage in overcoming his handicap, he keeps the story from moving forward until the last thirty minutes when the story's stature becomes more important because of the impending threat from Hitler and WWII.<br /><br />However, it must be said that Colin Firth plays King George VI with gusto, matched only by Geoffrey Rush as Mr. Logue, his therapist. The two of them create sparks in many a confrontational moment of truth, and each has a firm grip on their roles. Equally proficient, but less noticeable and given a smaller amount of screen time, is Helena Bonham Carter as the gracious and adoring woman who stands by her stubborn man and presides over a household of two children, one of whom is a future Queen of England. In a lesser but still rich role, Guy Pearce is excellent as Edward VIII.<br /><br />But unfortunately, because of the film's preoccupation with King George's speech impediment, the film moves forward at a snail's pace and only becomes more urgent during the final half hour when the world awaits the king's reaction to the news that Great Britain has failed to prevent war with Germany.<br /><br />All the technical merits make the film outstanding in various departments, particularly the cinematography, costumes, settings and music. Colin Firth deserved his Oscar and Geoffrey Rush would have deserved a nomination as a Best Actor rather than Best Supporting Actor since his role his clearly a co-starring one.<br /><br />More importantly, the film does a grand job of humanizing the Royals.importantly, the film does a grand job of humanizing the Royals.

160459201X|5.0|Thank the Lord above for Dr. Joseph Murphy.  I have learned so much from The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, its the best book that I have ever read.  Since, I have read this book, my whole life has did a 360 degree turn around, due to the help from this book. I bought this book because, I have lost my job after 27 years, my job went to China, and I became depressed, literally just sleeping my life away. I was online one day, and just decided to look at Amazon books, and look at self help books that could help me get out of my state of depression I was in. Dr. Joseph Murphy gives excellent advice on how your subconscious works and how to make it a useful tool in your life. I have come to realize and understand life more in an more and understanding way. The book has made me smile and gave me the inspiration & hope that I needed.<br /><br />Since reading this book my life is better.  I am not working but now I am going back to school to become a Registered Nurse, something that I always wanted to do since age 5, but wasn't able to.  I love my life now and Iam creating it as I plan & realize it will work to my advantage.  So, losing my job was a good thing, because I was limited in growth there. I have been surrounded by a lot of negativity all my life.  I knew that something had to change. So, I decided to step out on faith and test Dr. Murphy suggestion and do the prayers and my life has changed, and I believe now beyond a shadow of a doubt. Never knew the power was within me.<br />I am happy now, and I love and The Infinite one above whom I call \\"The Great I am\\".  I have much faith in me & in God.  I speak and think  more positive now. I treat others betters, and I bless others with kind words of inspiration and I am thoughtful and helpful.  Some of these qualities I had already of me and I was doing them before I read this book. I make sure that I am in positive environment, and if not I place my subconscious mind there in a bliss.<br /><br />I also bought a copy of this book for my Mother hoping it would help her, because she brought me up in a 1/3 positive and the other was majority a negative environment. I have seen changes in her, and I pray it will continue to heal her and bless her in a more and positive way. I have alway prayed that I could find her something to bring happiness to my Mother, my prayers got answered but it took decades.  I have forgiven her & I bless her.<br />I love this book, and mostly I admire this book. It stays on my nightstand and I go back and re-read it for guidance and strength and encouragement daily.  I thank The Great Iam for giving me a mind to receive and also to understand.  This book is worth far more than I paid for it.

097747609X|5.0|Look around you, it is happening again and again and again. Know history. Who controls the media and the news? Who is over represented in the Banks, Wall street, National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, etc? It is clear why Germany did what it did to survive. It is happening again and the non chosen ones are letting it. People do what they do to survive. The non chosen ones don't need to prescribe to hate or racism to solve the problem, but they need to be aware of it and prevent discrimination. You are being discriminated against every day right now by \\"religious reasons\\", which have no basis, except a long history. The old testament was written by a tribe wandering in the desert to justify their origin and rights to some land. It is not for you who were not chosen by God. Read Voltaire.  As Voltaire said God chose no one, he chose all people. The arrogance of anyone to say that God chose them is wrong, racist, and is the basis of all discrimination in the world. All ancient literature was written by people, not God. Once you accept that premise you see how everyone is being manipulated by the chosen ones and how they are winning and we, the non chosen ones,  are losing. Yes, the non chosen ones are losing. You don't need to read Mein Kampf, like I said look around you. Why do you think the US is the strongest supporter of Israel? Why are there tax breaks for Holocaust victims? Why not for Rwandans, Serbs, Croatians, Bosnians, Georgians, etc?  Why is it right, as someone else has said in these reviews, that the chosen ones can breed a pure race but others cannot? Isn't that racism? Why do prisoners who are the chosen ones get to go to a special prison? Why are they extradited to Israel after one year and set free? Curious?<br /><br />Lastly, the flood story was taken from mesopotamian literature. The chosen ones took it from the Epic of Gilgamesh and made it their own, as well as the creation myth. You don't have to believe me. Look for yourself. It is that simple. Be aware.ourself. It is that simple. Be aware.
0778320448|5.0|The Shop on Blossom Street kept my interest the whole way through. I read book 2, A Good Yarn, first and didn't think reading backwords would work but it did and I'm glad I took the time to read it.  I love Lydia's character and love watching her grow and grasp life without Cancer.  Debbie Macomber delivers every time!  I highly recommend her books which bring real women into our lives.  We who do not have sisters or lots of female bonding enjoy hearing how women interact and recognize our own deep feelings.  Great characters!

1606863622|3.0|I've been trying to find this book in hardcover for a long time. When I was able to find it on Amazon, I was happy. However, I was expecting a book that looks like the average hardcover book complete with jacket. The book I received was the size of a mass market paperback with no jacket. It resembles something that I'd find in the library. Just be aware that none of that is listed, it just says hardcover.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I own a pair of mid-range headsets from Sennheiser and higher-end IEMs from Ultimate Ears, so I do enjoy good audio. This is the first headset that I own that has an integrated microphone. I purchased this mainly for team chatting during online gaming.       Build Quality:       Feels very sturdy and durable. The microphone boom retracts and extends with ease. The cabling is extra-thick and sleeved up to the point where it splits into separate connectors; this is where it feels weak and flimsy with the potential to rip off. I purchased a Analog-USB adapter so I don't have to deal with pulling each connector out individually.    Audio:       The audio sounds tinny and distant, like a cheap pair of Apple headphones. I doubt adjusting the EQ will change anything. If you are buying these to listen to music, look elsewhere. The microphone is clear and sensitive (my housemate owns another pair and we chat during gaming).    Comfort:       The headsets cling firmly to your head without falling off, even when I try \\"ye olde shake-your-head\\" test. The velvety padding is very thick and comfortable, much better than the fake leather and plastic that most other lower-end headsets use. Velvet is a great choice because it won't stick to your skin, or tear and become an annoyance. The padding on the portion that goes over your head is 3/4 inch thick, and has a memory foam-like consistency. I have a big head, but I don't feel that it's a tight fit. I'm sure that it will break in over time and either become more comfortable or be too loose.     Overall:        You get what you pay for. For $24 dollars with 2-day shipping, nothing can beat it. Great for gaming, but poor for listening to music. It serves its purpose. I hope this review will help you make your decision.
B00004TX5F|5.0|Sumptuous romp of a movie depicting the life of arguably the world's finest every singer, Carlo Broschi , or as he was better known, Farinelli. Tragedy and triumph, love and betrayal, every appetite was sated, and of course there was the beautiful music. I loved this movie.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Its an awesome show. The comic is awesome aswell (obviously) but it is really different in some ways than the tv show. Which is almost kind of nice becuase the show is like super boring and predictable if youve already read the books.     I just bought it so one day when im old and get married and have kids, i have something to pass down to my kids lol

0399250573|4.0|I enjoy the Alex Rider series and I thought this book ended the series appropriately. It was very well written and had it's usual twist to the plot. Alex Rider once again found himself in many difficult situations that gave the book thrill and mystery. I would recommend this book to teens and young adults. Scorpia Rising was a fantastic book!
B004UID2LC|4.0|works fine for HTC thunderbolt, only concern is the song opens in only this application, not any other app, otherwise good..
0545123275|4.0|I found this book in my English room and I was immediately  drawn to the cover. I was a little cautious when I realized it was another werewolf story. I was sick of all the Twilight seeming books. But when I started reading I was drawn to the main character Grace. She and I are both rather antisocial and I was drawn to obsession with the wolves. Then when Sam came into the picture I thought about putting the book down in case it turned into another Twilight based novel. I was very happy when it went in an entirely different direction. It is an epic fantasy/love story that sends you reeling with each passing chapter. An amazing novel over all but probably for at least freshmen and up. Anyway, a must read of the summer or winter depending on your preference.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|as i finish this series i'm just impatient to get my hands on the 3 part, this new view on Evangelion is a must see. don't miss it out.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Amazing for its time. Still great to watch even now. Great artistry - was made without much trendiness so that it is still relevant and attractive today, 35 years later; quite a feat!
6305428387|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of a group of people with different objectives gather into a new adventure, and the effort is more than reaching the objective. Based on a real life story, it gives to all of us a new lesson.    Only thing: this DVD version doesn't have subtitles in other languages.
0061726826|5.0|Heart breaking, beautiful love story. From the beginning this book has you thinking of the choice we make in our lives and what it would be like to not have them. As the book progresses there is one surprise after another building up to the big conclusion and ending. The author leaves you with enough information to finish the story in your head but also leaves enough hanging to create a sequel. I couldn't put this book down because I just had to know what would happen next. This is a great book for high schoolers to read and to open a to discussion.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|If you love Evangelion, then this is for you, a nice anime, familiar yet fresh and new, i was missing some parts i remember seen on the 1.01, don't know if this was intentional, but you can see that content on the 2 disc, so, yeah is awesome, the new animation is neat and doesn't look forced.
B002ZG976U|4.0|Not quite sure why this film made no money in the theatres, musicals are such an underappreciated lot these days. But if you like Christina's and/or Cher's voice(s) and big, splashy dance numbers, you have to see it. The music and costumes will blow you away!
B004SKLD9A|5.0|I love this movie!! Now, I have a plain old hdtv, no surround sound or any other fancy gizmos to 'optimize my viewing experience,' but this movie looks great and sounds great on my tv. If you like the movie, BUY IT. This was a lesser known movie, so i doubt any studio is going to waste its money releasing a \\"Super-Ultimate Director's Cut, presented in it's original aspect ratio with super HD sound.\\" So, if you like this movie, and don't care about the technical crap like everybody else, buy it! You won't be dissapointed.
B004TE6F66|5.0|Crazy, exciting, sad, fun and so much more. This page turn will have dieing for more. You won't be able to put the book down until the end but even then you'll be screaming for more.
0316019984|5.0|Based on the price, I was expecting an average, nothing-special pop-up book. When it arrived, I was absolutely astounded by how beautiful it was! There's so much pop-up art packed into so few pages that the book itself is thicker than a dictionary, and the artwork itself is beautiful. I've never seen a pop-up as animated or as HUGE as the ones in this book. Great overview of DC characters, SUPER interactive - I gave it to my boyfriend for his birthday and he's still excited about it weeks later.
B004ZT9QVQ|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the doctor, but this episode was total crap. I honestly think it is the worst episode of the entire new Doctor Who. One horrid cliche after another- it made me roll my eyes. There's no new information necessary for continuity, so you can safely skip it.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Very cool scenes.  Not at all what I thought how it would end.  Originally missed the ending due to the plane landing with about 20+ min left of the movie.  Second time saw more stuff that I missed the first time and, the ending was vey cool.
B00003A9QI|4.0|Product was received in a timely fashion and was in new condition as advertised. Would have liked to sample a few songs before purchase however.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I have heard about Evangelion, the manga and the TV series, from friends who are clear mecha-anime fans and they gave it their full support.  But I was bit unsure of getting into the series, which meant spending loads of money to buy box sets of DVDs and spending time to get emotionally involved.  Fast forward to today, and I see these rebuilds of the original series for sale, which are films that combine the material essences of the franchise with updated touches, shades, 3D CGI support, animation sequences, and new elements to flesh out the original creator's desires with new tools of animation at his team's disposal.    I have never watched a Neon Genesis Evangelion episode, so I was treated to an instant classic even though I was never exposed to its storyline one bit.  An intense storyline combined with imagination that is timeless, I see why Evangelion is the prime series where other mecha draw instant inspirations.  The animation and the art of this re-boot is simply fantastic, bringing modern Tokyo-3 looking like today's Tokyo but with the futuristic mold of the not too distant future with mechs and more mechanized buildings.  The action sequences are intense, but never go beyond overload; the climatic scene when facing the 6th Angel is stupendous.    Though a cliche anime story of a young boy who is pulled out of nowhere to save mankind from certain doom and follows his angst and struggles along the way, its nonetheless a timeless tale that really shows why it pushed the world of anime into a new realm staring in 95'.  A new fan myself was treated to see why that is...
B0045DO8NI|4.0|Pink at her best  ... although many of my faves were left out.  Yet how many songs can you put on a greatest hits album before it's $50 and over the top.  This CD is definitely worth every cent though. Pink rocks on!!  I love the \\"So Far!!\\" in the title as I know she still has so much to show us.  A true talent, Pink is.  And she is a fellow Virgo so of course.  hahaha
B004EC5IUW|5.0|good movie, althought it is not the exact same story as the original series, it has a couple new characters and a few different angels.  im eager to see how they tell the ending.
B0040QYROA|4.0|Metropolis:<br />Freder Is A National Socialist Hero<br />Metropolis is ruled over by a She-Devil the \\"Man Machine\\". Mr. Frederson, the head of the industrial city which is probably Berlin, adores her and worships her. He can't see beyond her and at night sits passively in his chair and gazes out at the lights of the town that have a glittering surface allure.<br /><br />The corruption of Weimar, Germany is everywhere in the 20's film. We have gaudily clad girls in flapper suits going up and down the elevators putting on makeup and looking at themselves in pocket mirrors. We have dancing girls who look like a cabaret show. We even have the Thin Man with a wicked grin and a slick suit. He positively reeks of moral decadence.<br /><br />Meanwhile the \\"good woman\\", Maria, is down below with the workers underground. But she preaches long endurance and suffering, not action. She is looking for a mediator to come to them and finds him in Mr. Frederson's son, Freder.<br /><br />In typical National Socialist style, Freder must aggressively assert himself and throw off the influence of decadent women to get anywhere. Though inspired by Maria, he does all the work himself. At the end of the film she can only point to Mr. Frederson trying to shake the hand of a worker. It takes Freder to make their hands meet. Men must be men, not womanish. That was what was wrong with Weimar, Germany. It allowed the women to take over. We are reminded that Goebbels liked this film.<br />by Linda Cargill, author of Key to Lawrence
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Well, first I have  Droid X.  If any Droid X users are having a problem getting the 1.2.0 Carnival update...Get ready to be pissed off.  Getting the 1.2.0 from the Amazon MP was a tremendous hassle.  In order to get the 1.2.0 Carnival update, I had to completely uninstall the 1.1.0 version, which really SUCKED!!!!  Then I had to re-install the 1.1.0 Rio complete game from the Android MP, not the Amazon MP.  Then I was able to install the 1.2.0 Carnival update without any problems from the Amazon MP.  The bad thing about this process was that ALL of my Rio data is now gone.  I have to start all over from the beginning from stage 1-1.  I love this game and don't mind re-doing all the stages again but having to do this to get 1.2.0 is a really piss poor way of getting this update.  Amazon Market Place never offered me the update (until I completely uninstalled the entire Rio 1.1.0 game) on my phone...and it has been 2 days already.  I tried a number of ways to get this 1.2.0 update with no luck.  Uninstalling and re-installing 1.1.0 was the only way of getting Carnival 1.2.0 on my DX.  I am kinda pissed off with this whole thing of updating my Rio.  If it wasn't such a good game, I would've uninstalled this game and never looked back.  If I have to do this every time I have to install an update with Angry Birds, Rovio can lick my balls.
B0013V33DG|3.0|I've never watched this opera and the DVD gave me the opportunity to see Dessay-Florez in action. His is a unique voice perhaps suited to comic opera [Okay, now I'll duck], but having enjoyed his performance in \\"Le Comte Ory\\" [Met HD LIVE], I wanted to see this. Being aware that the setting was, for want of a better word, fastforwarded to early 19th century, this did not detract too much, but the overabundance of movement did. Dessay really was like a wound-up doll [goodness, she even had the looks of one, sorry!] unwinding at frenetic pace. My husband was asking, what's with the modern iron and board?    Two lovely singers with worthy instruments that might have been better applied by another director.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works great on Windows Vista (64-bit). It didn't auto-install the device drivers, but according to Plugable's website they put their drivers in the Windows Update database whenever possible; I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't auto-install because of my Windows settings being set to minimize automatically downloading stuff. In any case, installing from the driver CD was a piece of cake. The drivers are easily found on Plugable's site as well.    Incidentally, I use this to connect our desktop computer, through an [[ASIN:B001TH7GUU AmazonBasics  USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (9.8 Feet / 3.0 Meters)]] out a window, then a [[ASIN:B00483WRZ6 Plugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub (with Power Adapter)]], and finally this USB-RS232 adapter, to a Celestron CGEM astronomy tracking mount.
B001E45XT4|4.0|When I purchased this headset I was a bit skeptical of how comfortable it would be. Needless to say, I'm very glad I bought it. At the time I purchased it, I got it for a steal, and I mean like 50$ less then all the other $69.99+ gaming headsets available. The most important factor for me was how comfortable the headphones would feel on my head; in the past I've had problems with pretty much every single headset I've owned not being comfortable, I was pleasantly surprised when I placed the phones on my head for the first time. The ear cups don't actually touch your ears, they fit completely around the outside of them, and luckily my ears are small enough that they don't touch the inside plastic of the earphone cups, so they're definitely the most comfortable phones I've owned to date. The amount of pressure applied to the sides of your head can get a little irritating after several hours of use, but I've found it to not really be an issue.    The sound reproduction is pretty good, and I was amazed when I tried them on for the first time and played some dubstep through them. The bass was bumping, and although the highs and mids were a bit tinny, the lows were right on point.    For the price I paid for these, I would recommend this headset to ANYBODY who asked me about my cheapest\best pc headset opinion.     Con - The Y split at the end of the cable where you plug the mic and speaker jacks into their respective line in's don't allow you to separate the mic and speaker wires. This isn't an issue for most people, but for me, my headphones jack is located on my PC speakers receiver (logitech z-5500) and the mic jack is located on the back of my pc case. This means every time I want to use my headset I have to unplug my Z-5500 speakers from the back of my computer and place my headphone jack into the green port, and the mic jack into the pink port. ITS A HASSLE.    This isn't really Plantronics fault though, Logitech should have not went lazy on the receiver design, andadded a mic throughput to the receiver so I wouldn't have to make that stretch. If keyboards nowadays do it, you would think a set of 400$ computer speakers with an LCD receiver, would come with standard features like that.
159420229X|5.0|I don't ever write reviews for books I've read, but for this one, I've made an exception. The title itself is a bit of a hint of the strategy used for memory. It's a title I haven't forgotten when recommending this book to family and friends, and a bit of the story in the book helps me to remember the authors name. I don't want to spoil anything in the book, but I like how it is not a sole \\"self-help\\" book, but it could be. it's not a short history on the art of memory from ancient times to the present, but it could be. It's not a book about people who, for one reason or another, have serious memory difficulties or memories that are borderline superhuman, but it could be. Mr. Foer has written a personal narrative about his one year journey to the American memory championship, and sprinkles in a little of the topics mentioned above for a well informed read on all-things dealing with memory.
0670022411|2.0|I was excited when I first read about Deborah Harkness' \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" since it involved magic, vampires, witches and other supernatural elements that often appeal to me.  Unfortunately the book did not live up to my expectations.      The story of witch Diana Bishop and vampire Matthew Clairmont is sort of an uneasy mix of \\"Twilight\\", Harry Potter and \\"True Blood\\".  While I think Harkness is a good stylist, her storytelling just doesn't measure up.  The book is often very boring and overly detailed.  It takes much too long to get anywhere plot-wise.  I was recently talking to my family about books over lunch and my sister-in-law mentioned that she was trying to get through a very dull book about witches and vampires; turns out we were reading the same book and felt exactly the same way about it.  She gave up before finishing.  I told her that I started this book back in March and have read at least 10 other more compelling books since then; I kept picking it up and putting it down in favor of something else.  I admit to a certain amount of ADD but if a book isn't holding my attention I tend to go elsewhere for entertainment.      I hear a sequel is in the works but I will not be reading it.  It's unforunate since Harkness is clearly not a bad writer.  I would compare my reaction to this book to what I felt about \\"Wolf Hall\\" by Hilary Mantell: that I can respect the author's obvious ability but not like her book very much.  I can't honestly recommend this book, it's just not that good.

1595826971|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo29YZ7HPISGDSJ]]The Art of Alice: Madness Returns is a video game art book. A very good one.<br /><br />The book's a 184 page hardcover published by Dark Horse. It's in a large vertical format. The paper is thick low glossy. Binding is superb. Production value is top notch.<br /><br />The concept art and ideas are awesome. There are out-of-the-world background paintings, character designs, props, weapons and gruesome creations. Also included are discarded ideas that didn't make it - usually the too abstract.<br /><br />When you mix a classic like Alice in Wonderland with pop culture, video game designers, concept artists and throw in a Victorian-gothic theme, you get very strange new world. A world so dangerous Alice has to be equipped with a kitchen knife at all times or sometimes a Bazooka firing hammer (yes, hammer) or a teapot cannon.<br /><br />Every page brings a little element of surprise and twist. You can see crows with baby faces, Jack the Ripper with tentacles, Alice helping a mother giving birth to a load of kids (gruesome concept), an angler fish with human legs, cow birds, steampunk-like contraptions, a Chinese Humpty Dumpty, flying pig noses, embellished pieces of weaponry, etc. There are lots of mix and matches for things that shouldn't go together.<br /><br />The environment and set designs are amazing. It looks like some gothic Victorian hell that Alice is treading through. The landscape is ever changing along the game. They are beautiful and detailed. They totally nailed the mood.<br /><br />There's also plenty to read with the little captions that describe the designs, characters and stories. It gives a nice idea of how such a strange game came about. It's all very interesting to read.<br /><br />Some of the artists involved in the book are Ken Wong, Sun Guoliang, Luis Melo, Hong Lei, Wu Yuehan, Ben Kerslake, Nako, Tyler Lockett, Fellipe Martins, Pu Jinsong, Wang Shenghua, Yuan Shaofeng, Jin Lei.<br /><br />This is an excellent art book.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|I have liked every album Joe has put out, but it seems to me he puts a stronger and weaker ones and I would rate this as one of the stronger ones. More so than Black Rock. My two other favorites are Blues Deluxe and The Ballad of John Henry. The guitar work is stronger here and i think the songs overall are as well.     Good duets here as well. Although I would rate Heartbreaker as the weakest because I find Glenn Hughes' voice kind of irritating. It is also why I have only listened to the Black Country Communion CD maybe twice. The songs are good and the guitar playing is excellent, I just can't take the singing.    Anyway, this is a great effort and would recommend it to anyone.
0670022411|4.0|I found this book to be unlike any other \\"fatasy\\" book that I've ever read. The Auther did a wonderful job, and it shows that she loves her history. I did find that it slowed in a few places, but it picked back up and kept me reading. I cant wait to read the next book!
B004LL1HM4|3.0|Fleet Foxes return with their sophomore album, \\"Helplessness Blues\\". It's pretty much identical to their first album. Depending on what you want from the band this is a blessing or a curse. For me, their debut album reminded me of that early 1970's folk rock vibe that bands like Crosby, Stills & Nash and America did so very well, along with some Beach Boys airiness added to the mix. This was both refreshing while not entirely 'new'. In fact, I felt their debut lacked variety, and that's what their sophomore album lacks as well. Variety.<br /><br />Now I know there are differences between the tracks on \\"Helplessness Blues\\" but they are very subtle. There's a lot of similar sounding guitar strumming on nearly every track. Many of the rhythms are similar sounding. That's not to say there are no gems to be found here. I liked \\"Battery Kinzie\\", \\"Hopelessness Blues\\", \\"Lorelai\\", \\"Someone You'd Admire\\", \\"Grown Ocean\\" and \\"Montezuma\\". This is half an album, not a full one. There are at least three tracks that I had trouble with: \\"The Plains/Bitter Dancer\\" and \\"The Shrine/An Argument\\" were much too long and didn't really seem to go anywhere. I like 10+ minute songs as much as the next person--Yes, Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, King Crimson, Rush--all of them have great long-form tracks, but Fleet Foxes have much work to do in that department. The instrumental, \\"The Cascades\\", while pleasant, also didn't really seem to enhance \\"Helplessness Blues\\". \\"Bedouin Dress\\", \\"Sim Sala Bim\\" and \\"Blue Spotted Tail\\" are decent if not faceless tunes to pad the album.<br /><br />Five stars this is not. This is three and a half stars--better than average, but not quite four stars good. This band has much work to do. You can't just keep making the same album and expect to have a solid fan base. Oh wait, isn't that what The Grateful Dead did? I stand corrected, jam bands seem to have this unshakable cult following just like Dave Matthews and Phish. I respect these jam bands, but they are just plain boring to me in their deliberateness to stay out of pop land, out of the mainstream. Fleet Foxes could end up on the cult circuit, churning out the same jammy music, or they could meld their personal style with something more accessible and have true alternative folk rock status. This remains to be seen.<br /><br />2008 Fleet Foxes: Four Stars<br />2011 Helplessness Blues: Three and a Half Starso me in their deliberateness to stay out of pop land, out of the mainstream.

0470876417|5.0|The positive reviews here say it all.  I would like to simply address two themes that come through in the negative views:    1) Simplicity.  Yes, this book does simplify a hard topic.  It is very hard to create a successful business model.  The process by which one is created, however, should not be hard: that is what this book does...it presents a simple approach to the very hard need of creating a good business model so that maximum time can be spent actually making it successful.  It is hard to boil such an advanced and important notion down to its simple essense, and that is what this book does.  Thus the criticism that the book is \\"too simple\\" really must be considered a strength, not a weaknesss.    2) The font size.  Really folks?  That never even crossed my mind as I read it, but now that I see the reviews, yes, it is small font.  But that's worth maybe a half star off for those who even care (I'm not one of them; the font size is fine), not a flaming review!
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|Cool looking game, looks like a virtual pool game that would be played on a computer but the controls are really awkward which takes all of the fun out of it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|A great movie. Such a good wrap-up to the beloved trilogy. seldom does a movie series just keep getting better and better, but toy story never disappoints.
B0038YV36U|1.0|I bought this download on the recommendation of a friend, and what a waste of $7.99 it was. I already had \\"Corazon Sin Cara\\" from another download, and the rest of this album is little more than oversimpilfied lyrics to a basic Latin beat. And his uttering \\"Royce\\" and \\"Too Strong\\" all through the lyrics shows just how in love with himself this little boy really is. I'll not waste any more of my money on this guy and his egotistical mumbo jumbo.    UPDATE***  So far I have let 4 other people listen to this album and they all agree with me, it COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD ALBUM except for his constant uttering of his name and the nonsense \\"Too strong\\" throughout the entire album. Maybe someday he will grow up and be more in love with the music than with himself, but I won't know because I will not waste any more money on him.    I wonder if there is anyway that I can get a refund?
0061353248|5.0|One of the best books I have read.  Very insightful!
B0037W68F4|5.0|It's good, really REALLY good. MGMT did here what many bands have failed to do in the last decade by making a cohesive ALBUM in it's entirety with a distinct sound that as far as new music goes, isn't mistakable for anyone else. That's right, not SINGLES, an ALBUM! If you've ever read an interview with these guys and see what kind of music they are influenced by, you'll understand where this album is coming from. Of course, I am a huge fan of Oracular Spectacular, but I really like the fact that they didn't just turn this album into Oracular Spectacular 2.    If you buy into people smashing the album to bits because it's \\"lifeless\\", \\"not catchy\\", or whatever else the kids are saying, than I guess you should be downloading top 40 songs onto your iPod and listening to them a few times with your friends before you get bored of them and move on to the next fad.    I'm not going to spell out for you which songs are better than others, because you really need to be ready for this album. You'll know within the first few seconds of the first song if you're ready or not. So you don't need my opinion to form your own. I would suggest though that you immediately place this album in your rotation.
0316236535|5.0|My son likes this book.  It is fun and entertaining and the repeating phrases make it easy to 'read along' with.  I like the cut out pages that make it really fun to look at.  It can also help kids get over fear of a monster.
B00005O3VD|1.0|This product is defective. The opening credits and begining of the movie are BLANK. Video and sound kicks in 10 minutes after the start of the movie. This is the THIRD DVD of this movie I've purchased, all of which were defective in this manner. So what is the problem? It's time for Amazon to check into this. Up until now everything I've purchased either directly from Amazon, or from an Amazon supplier has been great.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|It's rare that I spend big bucks on a brand name product if I can buy a generic brand for a lot less. But in this case it was worth it because the case fits like a glove dSLR camera. I paid fifty bucks for this case (price is creeping up) and I feel it was worth it. Some times it makes no sense to skimp on things if they protect your big purchase. When you have an expensive dSLR camera you need to protect it from dust, dirt, weather elements etc. This case fits perfectly Canon Rebel T1i, T2i, T3i with 18-55 mm lens atttached. The case is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is light, soft (spongey) and has a short strap that snaps around the wide Canon strap that comes with the camera so you can have the case dangle while you're taking pictures (or remove it if you prefer). It is not a bag and there are no extra pockets. Think of it as a glove rather then a pocket. I'm very happy with this purchase, although realistically the price should be ten dollars - but we live in the brand obsessed society, so that will not happen. Now if only Canon would make a camera cap that attaches to camera itself, so I wouldnt' lose it! All those velcro leashes are pretty useless.
B002NZK5QY|5.0|Amadeus is a terrific movie. It has a just the right balance between fact and imagination. The story line is engaging and basically accurate historically.It easily holds everyone's interest, costumes are georgeous and the music, well it's Mozart. Great family entertainment. Good way to teach a little history and music appreciation.  Showed it to the grandkids (13-17yrs.) and they were mesmerized.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I bought this CD based on one song - Grenade.  I didn't realize there were other songs I knew - and loved - on this CD.  Bruno Mars seems to be a delightful talented young man with a long road ahead of him.  I's glad I found this CD and added it to my collection.  It will be in my rotation for a long time.
0307454541|1.0|You've got to be kidding me. That is what I asked several friends who praised this book from the high mountains saying it was The Best Book Ever. My response: Not even close. I mean, really? Who could derive any pleasure from reading this novel? Rape, torture, murder, violence in every sense of the word. The real mystery is why this nonsense was ever published, why was it ever translated, and why, why, why has it remained on the best seller list for so long? I mean, really?? No, I will not be reading any sequels and will not dare let my eyes fall upon the movie- Swedish or english. Just plain awful.
0887306667|5.0|I loved this book because it's so simple but true. I have mixed feelings because it gives you insights on how to market your business but at the same time helps you realize how hard marketing really is. But who should be surprised? If the authors didn't tell us how the world really is, then I might walk away thinking that marketing would be easy when it's not.

I´m one of your satisfied customers since I chose you 6 years ago. It´s so easy to buy, because you provide avery detail of the product I want, you can choose between different ways of shipping, the way you want to pay for it, and you always delivery the products on time.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|With so many reviews there should be little left to say on it but I Loved this book and cant wait to read the rest of the series. I dont think Ive read a fantasy series that was a well put together and epic as this since The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|i Think that Matt Smith is great as the Doctor, he reminds me in a way of Tom Baker Doctor Who number four, but yet he's not doing a youger version of him.  Yet again the team behind the show, keep on hiring the right actor to protray him.  I love the way he is so unimpressed by the villians, and takes the wind out of their sails!  They think they are going to win, but hell no!  It's the Doctor that does.  I hope that Matt Smith can do a third year, one thing for sure when it's said that a good man is going to die, of course it does'nt mean the show will go, of course not its a ratings winner.  I do have a suggestion, bring back the Time Lords.  No longer have him be the last one, this way it will give the writers more story ideas.  I'm sure that they can do it.  One idea they can have for free, is that someway, somehow the Doctor was'nt offically deposed as the President, and they bring him back, and he has to figure a way out, which of course he does.  He then continues to travel throughout the universe!  And last, but not least Long live the Doctor!  This is really Part Two of my review, about the Doctor dying in 200 years, you know of course the first show of the new season.  Well no way that should happen, like the Enginzer bunnny(batteries) he keeps on going and going and going, well of course you get the idea.  Of course the Doctor will not be killed off eventually, if the writers allow that to happen, well it might be a good idea for them to don duguises and leave the country.  Just kidding, well maybe, no! really just kidding!  The writers will find a way, such as that was not the doctor, he cloned himself, because he was able to see into the future,and is not going to allow anyone to take away his 12th regeneration, which of course he will end up getting a new 12 regeneration cycle.  Which those who know Doctor Who, that in The Five Doctors, the Master was offered a new regeneration cyle, if he helped the fifth Doctor.  So gain long live (of course) the Doctor!
0312600844|4.0|This is an interesting book that slowly and stealthily gathers momentum and power. Like building a Lego castle, the precise, almost clinical observations of individual players connect to the larger theme of the contemporary American experience; the semblance of freedom yanking the chains of inner inflexibility, emotional insecurity and confusion. The author has an outstanding understanding of human psychology and social dynamics that can only reflect a remarkable inner clarity and self-understanding. Reading between the lines, i believe i can detect  an elusiveness, aloofness, irony and desire to be cool as well as a curious detachment and lack of passion.<br /><br />There is no good or evil as far as Franzen is concerned, just more or less deluded folks trying to make it through another day. We may want to love each other, to be independent, free and happy but we don;t know how. Even Republican venality, ignorance and short-termist greed hellbent on destroying the environment through mountain-top mining are mocked between the lines as lack of consciousness and social brainwashing. There are insightful vignettes describing Kristol-like NYC/DC neocons, T. Boone Pickens-like oilmen; aging rockers and the sad, insular & desperate world that represents a large part of the  alternative NYC art scene.<br /><br />The trajectories of lives in Freedom are tinged with sadness and regret, much of the book is permeated by quiet desperation which at times appears close to nihilistic. Even (or especially) when it is funny. Franzen's universe appears to be driven by human frailty, decency, (mostly) unexamined emotions and coincidence which merge into the large stream of American Life. There is no magic. Little inspiration. A curious sort of emptiness and a lack, perhaps, of soul. Walter's love of birds was a tiny little spark of light in the darkness composed of human frailty. Yet isn't it frailty, when acknowledged, that is required for authenticity? The  pain of living includes freedom for making  mistakes, correcting them or choosing to die with things left unsaid. I felt that people like Walter (a F. Doppelgaenger perhaps?) and Patty are preordained to suffer because they somehow (unconsciously? reflexively? helplessly?) see the bigger picture of what matters. Life catches them on a hook, like fish gasping in the air.<br /><br />Almost in spite of itself, an innate will to live and will to love surfaces out of nowhere at the end when the book reveals itself as a love story.<br /><br />I found the book dense & slow at the start, but it got to me after i slogged through ~half.

0060765488|4.0|This is a fantastic book. It takes you into a magical land that can only be created by one such as C.S. Lewis. There is never a dull moment which is good if you get bored with reading easily. However, there are a few downfalls. The book itself is relativley fast paced and sometimes the narrartion is a bit childish. All in all its a good read and a classic that nobody should ever miss out on.
B00006I53S|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1B37DQIBKR0L1]]great inexpensive lens.  I havent seen any of the \\"softness\\" or focusing issues with it.  The focal length is definitely the most usable of any lens out there.      The one downside is the variable aperture.  I wish it was just a 2.8.... but then the price would be ridiculous.    check the video i'm adding.  All the pictures in it are taken with this lens.  :)
B000MRAAJM|5.0|There seemed to be some confusion to which version this is. I bought it from Amazon and not a third-party, I recieved the 4 Disc BBC version for distribution in the US. Some people believe the video is 1080i (interlaced) and not 1080p. They would think this because the box says 1080i, HOWEVER, I've looked at the mt2s files contained on the Bluray disc through a codec analyzer and it contained no information about it being interlaced. Also With interlaced video there is the obvious \\"mouse teeth\\" or jaggedness seen most noticable durring fast motion and when you pause. I've look through many frames, paused, started, and took a hard look at the video. There is no interlacing. Its definatly 1080p like the other BBC released versions, likely just a missprint on the box.     Other than disputes of the video type the series is perfect. I was amazed. I didn't look to see if there were extras or not, I don't really care about extras. I just wanted to main series.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|One of the best CD purchases I made this year.  I am a fan of Jennifer Hudson, but this is the first time I purchased a CD of hers.  I really liked all the tracks.  I decided to purchase it after reading some of the other reviews on Amazon.com.  I am glad I did, and the reviews that are positive were dead on correct.  I dont know what the others were listening to, but I am sure that since their review, they are still listening to it, as it continues to grow on you the more you become familiar with the songs!  Buy it and try it for yourself !

Not sure as to what is causing this.  Perhaps a Vibrant/SGS thing?  I saw another Vibrant user reported similar issues.  Are there any other Vibrant (or other phone) users experiencing this too?  I will try some other tricks and report back.<br /><br />*UPDATE* I got it to work! See comments.

B003K1EYM6|1.0|This unit will not allow you to connect a smartphone/camera to the iPad.  An error message pops up, stating \\"Cannot connect -- device puts out too much power.\\". And that, is that.    As with all Apple products, there is no documentation in the box.  No trouble-shooting, no work-arounds.  It either works, or fails, and there is nothing you can do to save your soul.    The SD card reader works as advertised -- golly! -- but the object of the game is to connect your CAMERA to the iPad, and in this it utterly fails.      For Apple to have desiged a device that could not be connected to a camera was dumb in the extreme; for them to now sell an add-on that doesn't connect to 80 million smartphones isn't just dumb -- its criminal.   I will be returnimg this device for a refumd.

143350393X|5.0|After some of the really negative reviews on here, I was really skeptical about buying this Bible. However, I really liked the cover and was excited about the content, so I took the plunge.    Suffice it to say, I am not disappointed. Even though it's \\"imitation leather\\", it feels like real leather, and is really attractive. I did not find the pages to be too thin as people have complained. The content is unbelievable between the commentary on all the passages, introduction materials to each book, and general overviews of the OT and NT. This is an incredible tool.    Mark Driscoll has used the analogy that a lot of people are the equivalent of Christian gun collectors--they buy nice Bibles and then put them away, only so that people will admire them from the outside. The Bible is a tool, and there's nothing wrong with having an aesthetically pleasing tool, but some people have gone way too far and are complaining about things that really don't matter. Use your Bible, underline in it, and let God write its content on your heart.

BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BLAAAAAAAAAAAA BLAAAAAAAAAA!  But, this movie is SOOOOOOOOOOO much more!  This movie is about a man taking the time to understand his lover regardless of her ailment.  He fights to peel through her sarcasm, pity, and passive-aggressive behavior to understand her emotion while dealing with a disability. THAT! IS! A! REAL! MAN!<br /><br />NOW!

It's different from \\"The Heroin Diaries\\", but equally powerful and emotionally moving. Sixx:A.M. did it again! They created a work of art that makes a person take an introspective look at oneself to face the demons of the individual and society as a whole. Initial favorites... and it changes daily: \\"Are You With Me Now\\", \\"Lies Of The Beautiful People\\", \\"Live Forever\\", \\"Smile\\", \\"Help Is On The Way\\" & \\"Skin\\". (It was really hard not to write the entire album up!!!!!)

The show Enterprise answers a lot of questions that were unanswered in Next Generation and makes things a little clearer. I just wished that the show had continued on longer. I really enjoyed this series.

0802473156|5.0|I bought this book hoping to help me and mother and our relationship. My therapist recommended this book. I realize it's about couples and marriage but everything I learned in this book can be applied to any other relationship as well. Both my mother and I read it and our relationship is indeed a lot better and we have gained a much deeper and better understanding of each other. I recommend this book to anyone who feels as if there is nothing more they can do to salvage a relationship, who feels that they just don't understand the other person. Read this. It's not a miracle cure, but with some effort, it can open up new world of understanding.
B001VZY4M8|4.0|A recent hearing of Neil Young's 2005 CD PRAIRIE WIND got me to thinking that this always interesting singer songwriter had indeed matured in significant ways.  While I'm not going to argue that his early recordings remain among his most definitive--and certainly his most beloved--I can't help concluding that his more recent work is more polished, more direct and better developed than much of the early stuff.    In his earliest days, Neil Young could be downright cryptic.  I remember that, as early as BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD AGAIN, I found myself (budding teenage critic that I was) carping that a song like \\"Broken Arrow\\" only made sense if you either knew in advance just what, in indigenous American symbolism, a \\"broken arrow\\" stood for (namely, giving up the fight) OR if, like me, you happened to read all about it in an interview with the songwriter.    Yes, Young could be somewhat hard to decipher back then--as were so many other aspiring singer-songwriters held under the sway of Bobby Dylan.  And no, I'm not complaining.  Neil Young did better than most in the obcurantism department.  You kind of always knew what he was talking about, even when you didn't quite.  Did he really shoot \\"his baby, down by the river\\" or not?  Well, something bad happened, either way, but it might've just been metaphorical, right? Right.    It's pretty much the same with the title song of this, his second solo album (without Crazy Horse, I mean).  Story goes that when Ronstadt, Harris and Parton were recording that tune for the TRIO album, they gave its author a call to ask  him what the heck it all meant.  Neil's response: \\"How should I know?  I just wrote it.  Probably depends on what I was on at the time.\\"  Personally, I've always felt it had something to do with the \\"Wooden Ships\\"/BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE kind of millenniumism that was so au courant in the late 60s/early 70s.  Escaping in a silver spaceship to a \\"new home in the sun\\" sounded pretty good, especially given that \\"Mother Nature\\" was \\"on the run in the 1970s\\"--and has been doing all that well in the 40 years since either.    But significantly, for Young, it WAS a dream--one of several in the song--not the impending \\"reality\\" that Paul Kanter, say, seemed to be envisioning in his magnum opus mentioned above.  Neil Young remained something of a skeptic in the face of all that Age of Aquarius/Starship Enterprise bushwa, and it's to his lasting credit.  Still keeping it cryptic helped him hedge his bets at the time.  He could embrace counter culture values, while doubting their efficacy at the same time.  It worked for Dylan, of course, and for others (Grace Slick and Joni Mitchell, on the distaff side--although Joni's tranistion from self-conscious naif to worldly wise cynic was more abrupt).    Speaking of naivete, was the fact that Neil Young was, like Mitchell, Canadian and therefore at something of a remove from U.S. culture that led to something as (inadvertantly?) confrontational as \\"Southern Man.\\"   I say \\"confrontational\\" NOT \\"controversial,\\" since the song is plainly meant to be the latter.  But \\"Southern Man\\" is such a sweeping indictment of the U.S. South that you almost had to know that someone would eventually write a \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" response song to counter it.  Actually, I may be misspeaking a bit: Young DOES suggest that \\"change [is] gonna come at last/Now your crosses are burning fast\\"--meaning, one assumes, that barbarities such cross burning will soon be a thing of the past--so he IS placing hope in emerging cultural change--precisely from Ronnie Van Zant's generation.  But diplomacy is everything in politics if not in art, so the Lynyrd Skynyrd answer piece was all but inevitable--as was the Neil Young put-down therein.    But hey, they made up apparently, what with Neil doing \\"Sweet Home\\" in his own concerts AND Ronnie Van Zant wearing Neil Young t-shirts onstage.  Alls well that ends well, I guess.  My only point is that unlike other rock and folk songwriters of the era: Neil wasn't just about \\"epater les bourgeois,\\" or \\"l'establishment.\\"  Unintentionally perhaps, he was \\"epater-ing\\" young \\"Southern men and women,\\" potential Neil Young fans all.    All water over the dam now, of course, but while I wouldn't want \\"Southern Man\\" or \\"After the Goldrush\\" unwritten,  I find the older, wiser Neil Young somewhat more interesting in  his stark, wintry way.  I wouldn't say that Neil had \\"yet to find  his voice\\" (to cite a too-oft rendered critical cliche).  His early work was very much his voice THEN.  And musically, he was penning some of the best tunes of his life.  But AFTER THE GOLDRUSH is still a \\"young man's Young.\\"  Nowadays he almost certainly identifies even more readily with the \\"Old Man\\" he was \\"a lot like\\" in 1970.  Times change:artists grow in interesting, sometimes surprising ways.    And maybe that's the point to end on. Neil Young is full of surprises, as the erratic nature of his solo career attests.  I remember when I was 18 being a little disappointed in the relative \\"prettiness\\" of AFTER THE GOLDRUSH, and later still in HARVEST.  I liked the proto-punky, jagged edges of EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS NOWHERE and was wary of all the  \\"mellowing out\\" occurring at the time.  Didn't seem to be in the spirit of rock'n'roll to me.  Now I find it hard to understand my reaction, at least as it pertained to the ever-unpredictable Mr. Young.      It was Neil Young, after all, who almost single-handedly brought a bit of edginess to the CSN enterprise (although Crosby seemed to be genuinely trying at times).  Similarly, on AFTER THE GOLDRUSH, Neil allowed himself to rock out a bit on the aforementioned \\"Southern Man\\" and \\"When You Dance.\\"  Looking back, I may have blamed him a bit for the fact that in 1970, every sensitive 18 year old with an acoustic guitar was trotting out their covers of \\"Tell Me Why\\" or \\"Sugar Mountain\\" at college open mics everywhere.  Hardly Young's fault after all--and they're certainly not bad tunes, butthey are just one part of the array of styles and colors he dabbled in over the course of his 40+ year career.      Seems pretty remarkable looking back on it.

B000SR0K6O|5.0|It's hard to imagine a time when time signatures other than 4/4 or 3/4 were so unusual...but this album was ground-breaking back in the late 50's (9/8 anyone?).  It still holds up well today.    Time Out has always been one of my favorites.  Expertly played, well recorded, and full of amazing music...even by todays standards.  I've listened to it so many times over the years, it's actually very easy for me to think in 5/4 time now.    I was first exposed to it (Take Five) back in the mid-60's by a friends mom, who was a jazz fan.  As a young drummer at the time, it completely changed how I thought about playing, and listening to music. Hard to believe now that it was just an experiment back then, and might not have been released at all.    I have two vinyl versions, and a CD version.  I tend to prefer the vinyl, but that's not unusual for me.    If for some reason, you've not been exposed to the genius of Brubeck, Desmond, Wright, and Morello, Time Out is a VERY good place to start.  And there's a WHOLE lot more greatness where that came from!    Dave O.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I give this Soundfly Aux my highest recommendation for my particular application. I just bought a new Mazda2 and I really wanted to access my music files from a flash drive and have them played through some sort of interface, other than an MP3 player connected to the 'aux in' on the center console. I'm not an iPod generation type, don't want to spend a lot of money to buy one just for this application, and so am not interested in such. So I had to dig around to hopefully find some sort of interface that will let me play music on a solid state flash drive and play it through the head unit.    Enter the Soundfly Aux I found whilst perusing Amazon dot com's website for something like it. This little unit allows WMA files and MP3 files to be loaded into it via a flash drive or SD card, and after hooking it up to the Aux in and powering it up by the 12 volt out interface, plays them thru the head unit. Sounded exactly what I needed. And at $39.99, sounded like a bargain, too.    Now, all of my previous music files are WAV 16bit cd quality, which are not compatible with the Soundfly Aux. I'd not heard an MP3 file I liked the sound of yet, but, when I played them through the Soundfly Aux, it sounded amazing in the car. I inserted a flash drive and the Soundfly Aux categorized the files in their own folders, which are easily accessed by the remote control. I found the ability to tailor the in-car soundfield to my liking with the Soundfly Aux's bass, treble, and \\"dynamic audio booster\\" circuit (which gives a very subtle increase in dynamics that seems to put more life into the MP3 formatted music). The one and a half inch screen that can be angled for best view, can be set with a contrast adjustment to allow clear viewing, and gives all the info needed to set this up for any particular taste. Everything is very easy to use.    I can see that whoever designed this little interface really took the time to design it well. Everything works, there are a lot of soundfield adjustments, and if I didn't have an Aux input, it'll send the signal via the FM band of the head unit's radio. If I had an MP3 player, it'll access the files on it and play them thru the head unit.     But, even after all of the little things this Soundfly Aux does so well mechanically and makes it such a great digital music interface for my particular application, the bottom line for me is that it, surprise, surprise, makes MP3 files sound so great. This is one fantastic sounding car audio digital music interface. And a perfect match up for a Mazda2.     Highly recommended!
1439152780|4.0|The Distant Hours begins when its narrator learns that her mother was evacuated to a castle outside London during the blitz of WWII.  She is curious about the story and the three sisters who lived in the castle with their father (a famous author) and slowly unravels the mysteries behind her mother's and the sisters' past.     I really love the way Kate Morton writes--she has a way of describing things that leaves me speechless.  She'll toss in one-sentence descriptions that are so unique and vivid I find myself  stopping short to read them again.  Honestly I would read her books if only for that.  She is also a master of time and point of view shifts--she unravels the story in a non-linear way that is brilliant and keeps you guessing and trying to piece together the clues from all the character's lives.      The Distant Hours was an enjoyable read, and had me particularly riveted at the end, wondering how she was going to tie everything together.  The three sisters have complex, distinct personalities, and Morton slowly lets you get to know them and decide what you think of them (fascination? pity? love? disgust?) The ending had a definite gothic feel (think Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights) that I didn't particularly enjoy, but, like I said, I adore the way Morton writes so it was well worth the read.
0763644765|5.0|My little girl loves this book.  She reads it on the potty as well as off.  She loves every page.  It's simple enough to help toddlers with the idea of \\"going potty\\".  Now she tells me when she wants to go potty and we have this book in hand.  I recommend this book for every kid.
141694737X|5.0|We bought this book as a gift for my son's first birthday. It took him a few weeks to warm up to it, but when he's in a reading mood, our son carries it over to my husband and I multiple times a day to have it read to him (usually several times in a row!). The flaps are much, much sturdier than those in any of his other lift-the-flap books, most of which he's partially destroyed (the Karen Katz books in particular are ridiculously fragile, given the age range they're aimed at).
B002ZG975Q|3.0|The movie starts out 5 stars. Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) is a pretty boy running for H.S. president of the Green committee. He openly proclaims people should vote for him because he is good looking and his dad is a celebrity. He has a Barbie Doll girl friend and lives at home with his dad who ignores him. He takes out his lack of fatherly attention on everyone from the maid to the school witch, the later being a mistake. Kendra, the school witch, who can't rig an election (must not be a Chicago witch) portrayed excellently by Mary-Kate Olsen, places a curse on Kyle. Kyle will become as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside. He doesn't become Michael Berryman ugly, more like the lead singer from Midnight Oil ugly. He has one year to find someone who will tell him, \\"I Love You\\" or else he will stay ugly forever. At this point the movie becomes a two star teen-age Beauty and the Beast as Kyle stalks a girl from HS and eventually arranges for her to live in his gilded cage for her own protection from the drug dealers her dad is involved with. Neil Patrick Harris gives us a good performance as his blind private tutor who is more of a philosopher.<br /><br />When the story succumbs and becomes the Beauty and the Beast it falls apart. Neither actor was good enough to carry the burden of a trite script.<br /><br />I liked the fact that Beauty (Vanessa Hudgens) wants old fashioned hand written love letters. I thought that died with the younger electric texting generation.<br /><br />I would of liked to have seen expanded roles of Kendra and Neil Patrick Harris and less of Kyle wallowing in self pity. The movie might be a smash with young teen girls, but outside of that, it really doesn't carry much appeal.
B004SGWYVA|4.0|While other movies have come and gone, this one has certainly suprised me. I walked into this expecting something rediculously stupid, but was suprised by how amazing this really is. I like how they did stick to zombies being \\"walkers\\" because a dead body cannot run, it defies biology. The characters are interesting, there is suspense, drama, and all around awesome zombie killing. Just something that should defenitely be purchased asap by any anime lover. 10,000,000,000,000,000 times better than Garcey's Wings
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to say I was very skeptical about buying the book. I have never read a YA book before. But when my wife asked me to buy it for are Kindle I said what the heck I will read it too. This book blew me away, it dragged me into it so much I did not set it down, in fact the following day bought the other two books. O have to say Suzanne has a way with words and this book rocks for all ages.
B001608QVS|1.0|I only Rated this Item one star due to price......The content of these Movies are well worth $114, But why pay premium price for media now days Save more at Walmart, I just paid $10 for Dirty Harry/Magnum force and $10 for The Enforcer/Sudden Impact at walmart...they have them in double feature Blu Rays, Im sure even if Dead Pool Cost $20 then you will still be saving $80.....
B004GF244K|5.0|I am watching the blu-ray for probably the fifth time right now.  This is one of...no, THE most amazing concert video I've ever seen.  What strikes me most is the way that each successive song is better than the one before; when you think it can't get any better, it does--over and over again.  The lineup of musicians is absolutely incredible!  I've been a Beatles, Clapton, ELO and Petty fan for 30+ years, so seeing all of them together was a super special treat!!  The production is also top-notch; I don't know that it's ever been done better than right here.  Gosh, what an experience this must have been in person.  The Beatles are special, George is special, and it's so sad and awesome at the same time to see Paul, Ringo, Billy, Eric, and Dhani performing together--absolutely the best Beatles reunion that we will ever have from this point forward.  If you don't own this disc, buy it right now.  I don't do many reviews, so I hope you can understand how touching this was (is) to get me to write; you won't be disappointed!
B000002B35|4.0|I first purchased this CD upon it's initial release. (The Blinking Version) Over time the discs became too scratched and well listened to.     I was fortunate to see them play this concert in the New Orleans Superdome, and i will testify to this day as that being the best concert in my life. Stunning audio, effects and lighting. Although the actual concert was nearly 4 hours long and i wish they could have provided every song played during the concert, i realize it may not have been very marketable.    The VHS was missing songs, and the DVD disappointed me with even more songs missing from the actual concert performance. I would before I die hope to see a remastered full concert released on DVD or Blue-Ray.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|this is one of the most useful apps i have downloaded. works fantastic. i was looking for something to customize folders i made on my home screens on my droid2 and found this great app. once you create the widget on your home screen, say for games, you can customize the icon, then go through your list of apps in this software and classify each app where it belongs and it will show up automagically in the widget (folder) you created on your home screen. awesome! plus these widgets work 10 times better than the droid folders. also, when you download a new app, this will ask you how you want to classify it and it will show up in the folder-widget. fan-friggin-tastic!! love this app!
0140120416|5.0|I recomend this book to anyone who is serious about learning russian. it's over 500 pages long and covers just about everything, from the alphabet, the name of the letters, handwriting in russian, goes into great detail about the grammar, gives the stress marks for words, and even has decent sized dictionary in the book. whether a beginner or already know a great deal of russian this is a great book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|After repeated listening to an unbelievable album, it's clear that this is the work of a true artist. All the songs on this album are a standout, with four cuts above and beyond the rest.  In order of brilliance are Rolling In The Deep, He Won't Go, Rumor Has It and Turning Tables.  Rolling In The Deep being the obvious HIT is amazing but I think the true hit of this album is He Won't Go. I must have been missing something for a while as I listened to this number many times but never really heard it.  Last night in the car I really heard it for the first time and it totally knocked me out.  It was raining out and I had it on loud and it just ROCKS.  I love a song that has it all, from great arrangements, incredible production, sublime songwriting and most of all a perfect vocal to bring it all home.  Try this song in the car by yourself and turn it up and listen, it will blow your socks off.  As for the rest of the album, there isn't a bad song anywhere to be found, it's BRILLIANT!!

0385504225|5.0|The Lost Symbol will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I could not put it down it was so suspenceful.  I have always been interested in the Masons and this book revels a lot of their secrets.  I was intrigued with Dan Brown discription of Washington and had to buy the guide to go with the book. I can't  wait to visit Washington DC to check out some of the buildlings and landmarks mentioned in the book.
B000TERDES|5.0|I grew up listening to this album, and Smashing Pumpkins were my favorite band. It was the first of their albums I owned, and I still consider it their best. It has a beautiful mix of tranquil passages and wall-of-sound choruses. It features some of the most tender and most unique sounds that have ever come from a guitar.
0307887960|5.0|Very well written book with lots of info on how to lose weight and keep it off forever.  I may not be able to keep the weight off for life but it isn't because Dr. Dukan didn't give excellent instructions on how to do so.
0525423842|5.0|I loved this book for my 10 year old. It got him into reading more mature novels (i.e., not another Harry Potter). Its a different genre than The Firm, The Partner, The Testament, etc so shouldn't be compared to those. Its great for what it is, a book geared toward kids introducing THEM into the popular law genre of popular novels.
B003M6DJF2|5.0|I first heard about Glee via a Rolling Stone article covering the show- needless to say the article, while passable, did not do full justice to the show. After a full season and half of refusing to even tune into it,   I got turned onto it; it was Halloween, I was craving Rocky Horror, and settled for \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\". I then bought this episode, and have since been caught, hook, line, and sinker. The show hails with one of the most well crafted pilot episodes I have seen, and the show itself manages to capture the essence of nostalgic regretful longing, and boundless hope and joy in such a way as to suggest they are unified. I absolutely love this show, and recommend it to anyone searching for a \\"gleeful\\" release.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I buy from amazon all the time, and I've never been so disappointed!!  I guess I really should have read the reviews before I ordered it. The shows freeze, and I can't even watch an individual episode.  Each disc has to play in full, and the freezing starts during the 3rd or 4th show on each disc.  So the viewer actually can't even watch about half the episodes.  This will definitely be returned!
B003Y5H53S|1.0|I could not believe that this movie was marketed for children. There was a lot of violence and quite inappropriate language for the targeted audience. I found it difficult to believe that Johnny Depp would lend his voice to such a \\"project\\" for lack of a better word. Parents not only is this movie inappropriate for your children, I found that my grandkids got bored and restless and wanted to leave the theater way before the end of the movie. In short, the movie sucked and I regret wasting time and money going to see it!
0689835604|5.0|We bought this for our daughter when she was an infant and it was her favorite book! It was instant smiles as soon as we started reading it to her (with animation, of course!). As she got old enough to hold the book she started ripping the flaps off. So I bought her another one, and over time she ripped the flaps off again. She is now almost 2 and I am ordering her her 3rd copy of the book! It is still one of her favorite books.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Ready to buy the series and just am put off that the digital version is twice that of the paper back version. Wrong move publisher. You have lost my money.   (This 1 star review is related to the value of the product. When Publishers set a price that is twice that of other options then they desirve to have the product rated poorly because the value doesn't match the cost). Have too many books, so I won't be buying these. I guess I'll just check them out for free at the library. Way to not just loose money but also anger a consumer. I'll not be buying from this publisher in protest.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I do not normally read Nora Roberts books but a friend told me about this one.  You really have to be a dog lover to completely appreciate this book.

0765350386|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite books in the fantasy genre.  It has some incredibly compelling characters, an extremely well-constructed universe, and a plot that works extremely well.  Most importantly, though, it has by far the most interesting and well fleshed-out magical system of any book series I've ever read.  In most books, the magical system bends to accomodate the needs of the plot, but the metal-based magical system of Mistborn is almost mathematical in its precision.  The magic is inherently limited, but this allows Sanderson to do some very clever things with it, as the characters exploit these limited abilities to their fullest.  It also means that at no point is a character doing something that shouldn't be possible, much as it may look like they are at first.  It's this that really sets Mistborn apart from other fantasy series, and makes it such a worthwhile read.    The other books in the series are also well worth reading (and help flesh out the details of the universe), but I absolutely encourage you to give this one a try to start.
0307272702|4.0|Gary Taubes has slimmed down his previous book, Good Calories, Bad Calories in this recent NYT bestseller. He hammers the point that carbs are bad, the more recent point that calories may or may not count, and provides some historical perspective that most diet books don't.  Although the tone is sometimes strident, he seems to have an excellent grasp of the science, the scientific method, and how they look viewed through the lens of politics and public health. The scientists, clinicians, and politicians all get their share of censure.    I think this book will contribute to changing the thinking of many people about what they eat, who tells them what to eat, and why what we eat has national and even global implications.

0143116177|2.0|I feel as if I had only a rudimentary understand of financial history, and this booked provided little new information to me.  The book also seemed like two books crammed into one. One book about histrot of money, and one book with author givening their opionon on the modern finacial system, with the first book pretty good, but the second book kind of worthless. The book is an easy read: however, pretty mundane.
0440178002|5.0|This is a great plot driven novel. Exciting to read and hard to put down. The main characters are well fleshed out and interesting. It's a long book, but doesn't feel like. I think many people wouldn't consider this \\"literature\\" because it doesn't really encourage philosophical self-reflection or personal insight, so if that's what you're looking for you might want to look elsewhere. But I'm usually a bit of a lit snob and I loved this book. If you did like this book, you might also want to read Clavell's \\"King Rat\\" (in my opinion his best work), and Yoshikawa's \\"Musashi\\". Musashi actually begins at the battle of Sekigahara, when Shogun ends. It was written much closer to the time period, and by a Japanese author, so it probably gives a more accurate picture of what the time period was like.

B004OKFIYU|2.0|Mofi needs to sharpen up their act. Many of the latest releases sound a bit lifeless and do not sound better than the original remaster from Sony(and others). This mofi sounds a bit veiled compared to the Sony remaster. Why pay USD 30 then? Similar to mofi Stevie Ray Vaughan-Texas Flood, which is very very disapointing. On B. Joel-Turnstilles, mofi didn't even bother to print lyrics, and no info in general. Why? When record companys release remasters these gays, you get bonus cuts, extencive booklets, etc. Not so with mofi. What a shame and letdown for us consumers.
1151097764|3.0|A farm kid from Upstate New York, I grew up thinking of New York City as a place to be afraid of. I never went there, of course, but according to TV -- well, excluding Seinfeld -- and the movies, it was a jagged skyline towering above a huge steaming cesspool, where it was always nighttime and horrifying things happened to people. But as I got older and bored with my home county, that image began to appeal to me, and it's ultimately what brought me here.    It was that same city -- the dim grimy hole of crime and perversion, the New York of the 1980s -- that appealed to Tom Wolfe and inspired him to write 'The Bonfire of the Vanities.' Born into a genteel Virginia family, Wolfe has always been obsessed with race and class, and 'Bonfire' depicts a divided city: ethnically, politically and geographically. According to Wolfe's demographic map, in Manhattan below 96th Street is the insulated upper class of WASPs, who rarely set foot on the streets of their city. They live far above in high-rises and get ferried to and from work in taxi cabs. Also on the island are the Jews, who, after generations of struggle hold most of the positions in the city government but find power slipping from their grasp as New York demographically darkens. Then there are the masses of impoverished blacks and Puerto Ricans holding the upper half of Manhattan and nearly all of the Bronx and Brooklyn. It's clear from early in the novel that the future of the city is theirs: Riverdale is \\"a little freeport\\"; Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope \\"Hong Kongs\\"; the Bronx County Building is repeatedly called \\"Gibraltar.\\" For now they're getting chewed up by the justice system, but inevitably they'll organize and take the city. Acting as a buffer are the Queens-based lower-middle class Irish and, to a lesser degree, Italians who run the police and hold minor jobs in the city courts. Finally, there's the bohemian British expatriate community, in control of much of the city's press and motivated mainly by their contempt for Americans.    In terms of plot, Bonfire is the story of Sherman McCoy, a Wall Street bond trader from Park Avenue on the Upper East Side, born rich and getting richer. One night, while escorting his mistress from LaGuardia airport in his Mercedes-Benz, McCoy gets stuck in the wrong lane on the Grand Central Parkway and finds himself in the South Bronx. There he gets into a hit-and-run with a black high schooler that isn't entirely his fault. A good chunk of the book just consists of McCoy trembling over whether he'll get caught. But the boy's mother goes to the Reverend Bacon -- an Al Sharpton-style rabble-rouser who bends idealistic rhetoric to the purposes of intimidation and extortion -- and Bacon goes to the police.    The case lands in the lap of Lawrence Kramer, a Bronx assistant DA (one of hundreds) feeling trapped in his job and small apartment, sick of anonymity and tired of prosecuting young blacks and Puerto Ricans. However, Kramer doesn't fully realize what he has until Bacon's lawyer brings the story to Peter Fallow, an alcoholic English reporter on the verge of losing his job. When it breaks in the press, the police trace the crime back to McCoy and the car accident off Bruckner Boulevard becomes a collision of every faction in New York City. Black and Puerto Rican protestors storm Park Avenue. McCoy is dragged into a jail cell in the Bronx. The justice system revels in finally having a WASP in its teeth. Faced with a rallying block of minority voters, the Jewish politicians have no choice but to condemn the rich bond trader. McCoy hires a street-smart Irish attorney named Tommy Killian, who acquaints him with the seamier sides of the law. Ultimately, McCoy lets himself sink and embraces the violence and seediness of New York City.    If done as a drama 'Bonfire' would be painfully overwrought. But Wolfe is a satirist, and the book's outrageousness is all for the sake of comedy. The opening chapter with the mayor, the descriptions of high-class parties, of the protests, of the all-out brawl in the courtroom, of just about every scene involving Killian, are so over-the-top that the reader has to laugh. The book is also a kind of prophecy: in the '80s, an encounter like McCoy's \\"fracas in the jungle\\" probably seemed inevitable; the contradiction of the city's incredible wealth and unfathomable poverty was too great, it had to be resolved somehow. From Wolfe's perspective, as the white working class bled out of New York, the democratic process would leave the blacks and Puerto Ricans in charge, exposing the elite to the raw reality of their \\"Third World city.\\"    Of course, as I -- and countless others who've come to New York with the vision of a drippy, neon-lit metropolis -- found, that prediction proved completely wrong. In the '90s, crime was fiercely suppressed. The rich whites are richer than ever. New York has another Jewish mayor, now in his third term. Black and Puerto Rican communities are caught in a pincer between gentrification and the influx of Dominican, Mexican and Chinese immigrants. And while few neighborhoods have a strong Irish character anymore, and Italians are ceding their old strongholds in Brooklyn and Queens, the city has a growing population of white working class Eastern Europeans.    Which brings us to the question of the book's literary merits. Wolfe declared in 1989 that he'd revived the great realist tradition of the late 1800s and early 20th Century. But Bonfire is too much a portrait of a specific time and place and not enough of a novel. The book's leading men -- McCoy, Kramer, Bacon, Fallow -- are more or less the same character: vain, arrogant, sleazy, hungry for glory. Reading their interior monologues is a bit like watching a puppet show where all the dolls have the same voice. Some Internet troll will probably argue that Wolfe was trying to show the universality of certain human tendencies, but it's idiotic to think that people from such disparate backgroundswould have identical personalities. McCoy's third act conversion to a tough guy comes off as childish, and the plot is altogether too dependent on coincidence.    New York is amorphous and unpredictable, and any book whose main virtue is describing it accurately is doomed to be short-lived. 'Bonfire' is like an old Polaroid: blurring, curling at the edges, slowly turning brown and falling apart -- a reminder of the impermanence of things and of how shallow pictures really are. Like me, most people who glance at it today probably do so out of nostalgia for the dirty, gritty old city. Topical writers like Charles Dickens and John Steinbeck have endured because of their wide appeal and deep humanity. But Wolfe's writing isn't as powerful as Steinbeck's, and his characters lack the warmth and charm of Dickens'. Even though Dickens' London and Steinbeck's California have long vanished, in 100 years -- assuming anyone is still reading -- 'Great Expectations' and 'Of Mice and Men' will continue to enjoy broad audiences. But as Tom Wolfe's New York fades out of memory, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities' will likely do the same.    (...)
B004SKJIEC|1.0|Like always with AF releases, the sound is just so bad and lifeless. As ususal a reverse remaster job by the \\"great\\" Hoffman or Gray. The plot is suck the life out of the music and make it sound dull. Take away the sparkle and details. Why are not this company exsposed yet? Why do people use USD 30 to buy these discs? It really annoys me that this company still releases discs. It is an offense to the artists.

B0041IU1H4|1.0|I do not know what the other reviwer is on. The sound on this MOFI is poor and lifeless. The Sony sacd sounds much better, more life, more sparkle, more dynamics. This follows a trend in the latest Mofi releases: They generally sound like mentioned above and is not better than the old remasters. USD 30- What a letdown.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Like a lot of people, I prefer the XBox controller over the PS3 one by a pretty wide margin.  So when I started looking for a better controller for my playstation this one kept popping up.  I got the battery (3 AAA) operated ,wireless version for $29.00 and am very happy with it.  It has a good size and weight and supports both vibration and sixaxis. The buttons and analog sticks are very responsive and I have had absolutely no issue with \\"dead zone\\" that I have seen in other reviews.  This was a big concern of mine, but again, I have had no trouble at all.  The shoulder buttons and triggers are a big improvement over the PS3 controller (except that Sony games keep making me aim and fire with the shoulder buttons instead of the triggers - a pet peeve of mine).  I don't know how long the charged version lasts, but the battery version has great life.  I played through inFamous and Uncharted 2, both, without changing the batteries.    My only minor complaints are the USB dongle, not because it doesn't work, it works fine, but because I hate it sticking out of the front of the unit.  You can turn the unit off from the controller, but you can't turn it on.  Not a big deal, but I still notice it every time I power up.  And the textured grips.  I don't hate them, but I am certainly not in love with them.  I normally put a silicone cover on all of my controllers, but I have yet to find one that fits this one.  So if you're not 100% happy with the PS3 controller and are looking for something a little more thought out without sacrificing responsiveness, I think you can't go go wrong with this one.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|Only two movies ever made me feel like taking a shower after watching them because they were so raunchy. The first one was \\"Watchmen\\" the second one is this POS.<br /><br />Although I never have seen the original of I spit on your grave I think that makes it better because I can freely judge this movie. For the most part the first half of the movie just plays out like some late night porno. A girl walks around wearing a skimpy outfit gets hit on (what else is new?). She goes to a cabin alone to do what I don't know play with her laptop while drinking wine I guess. Apparently she's supposed to be a writer? Yeah I buy that. So writer girl prances around half dressed and sometimes in her underwear. She gets the attention of some locals and the obvious rape happens. I guess that's why I didn't like the film so much.<br /><br />Since this focuses on the rape so much it seems \\"FORCED\\" to say the least. I don't get the sense that the girl is being raped. I don't get to feel her trauma or her pain. I have no connection to her character. It's as though it's thrown in there to get it out the way. \\"Last House on the Left\\" had a better rape story. You got to know the victim and you felt a connection seeing her pain as she got raped. You wanted to see revenge for what they did to her. If your movie is going to be about a woman getting revenge at least build her character up so that we care about the revenge part. This was just like a dark porno (if they even make those) and a so so one at that. You actually feel that she did worse to the rapist than they did to her. Just because they developed her character so poorly.<br /><br />All I know is that the girl is from the city,dresses like a slut, smokes marijuana, and drinks A LOT of wine. That's all you get to learn about your character. How am I supposed to even care what happens to her? She might as well as be an extra in the background.<br /><br />Long story short this movie seriously lacks a decent plot. Pick this up if you like watching a girl get revenge on men in a way that would make Jigsaw smile.<br /><br />2Stars best part is the T&A from the main character that saved this from being a Lone star rating.on men in a way that would make Jigsaw smile.    2Stars best part is the T&A from the main character that saved this from being a Lone star rating.

0670022411|5.0|I thought this was an amazing effort.  Of course this book is long, with descriptive passages and seemingly redundant details that would be out of place in some other novels, but are appropriate here because of the many subject matters and the fact that this is part one of a trilogy. This book touches on history, religion, ancient alchemy, modern science, and blends in fantasy and romance - readers who are into this sort of blend would not be satisfied with a quickly written, double-spaced page turner that can be read in a matter of a few hours.  This book is meant to be savored, and the ending, which many people complained about, is not an ending at all - it is just a stopping point in this unlikely couple's journey.     I did notice that a fairly large percentage of the 1 and 2-star reviews were from 'readers' who have never posted a review on Amazon before, so this made me suspect as to their motives for writing a review at all.  And the remaining negative reviews seemed weighted towards readers who have reviewed before, but were expecting something along the lines of the Twilight series, and were disappointed.  My daughter loves the Twilight series and Harry Potter, but I would never recommend this book to her as something remotely similar, nor do I feel that this book would interest her at all.

B002ZG999U|3.0|It's been called \\"the best action movie of the year.\\" It's been the #1 movie in the country two weeks in a row! So it must be really good, right? Well, it's actually a pretty basic action flick. The plot is uncomplicated and straight-to-the-point. For some, that sounds great to them. For others, the simplicity is a little too simple and that subtracts from the film's overall quality.<br /><br />Stallone directs and co-writes the screenplay for this ultimate action star flick, and he does really well. The ensemble of Stallone, Statham, Rourke, Couture, Lundgren, Li, Crews, Roberts, and Austin (plus cameos by Willis and Schwarzenegger) do a wonderful job with the acting and blowing up body parts of bad guys. However, the story was written merely for an action purpose. There is an unbelievable part to the film near the end between partners-in-crime, the General (David Zayas) and baddie James Munroe (Roberts); I won't get specific so as not to spoil it. But, it's just not believable. Of course, the action is unrealistic but that's expected in any action flick. But this interaction with the General and Munroe makes the film -- particularly the ending -- a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Expendables\\" is a good film. I enjoyed it and liked all the action. The characters were well played and I am looking forward to the sequel that I heard is already in the works. However, I enjoyed [[ASIN:B002ZG994U The A-Team]] a lot more! Maybe it's because of my sense of nostalgia, or maybe it's 'cause I think Liam Neeson rocks. Either way, I enjoyed it better. But, again, \\"The Expendables\\" is no pushover (Stallone does a great job both in front of the camera and behind it), and I would recommend any action fan to see this as soon as possible.
0007236077|5.0|I found Humble Pie to be a really interesting read, well written in the same style Gordon speaks when he's on camera, once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  I knew nothing at all about Ramsay other than what I'd seen on Kitchen Nightmares and other TV programs.  So I was surprised to read he almost made it as a professional footballer, and was raised in a family of domestic violence, where money which should have been spent on the basics of living was instead wasted on the music career of his father.  Granted his father isn't alive to dispute Ramsay's version of events but on assumption that his memories are pretty accurate, you've got to have a huge respect for a man who didn't want to be like his father in wasting his life pursuing a dream on the slight chance he could make it (the football) and take on a less glamorous and fun, much more hard work career to become a top chef. This autobiography takes the reader on a journey into the various kitchens Ramsay learnt his skills, in both the UK and France and the hardships he had to deal with in reaching his dreams of earning his Michelin stars and ultimately owning his own restaurant.  It includes the hardships of losing his best chef who died while robbing a house to feed his drug habit and Ramsay's determination to make sure his brother didn't also end up dead due to following the same path. Although like most autobiographies, self criticism doesn't take up too much of the word count, you can't help but admire the man.  Certainly no one has made Gordon Ramsay eat humble pie, if they've done something wrong, he'll tell you about it in these pages.<br /><br />How Gordon Ramsay's TV career started is also covered as well as behind the scenes on his initial Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares and other UK shows is.  The US spinoffs, which were more to Ramsay's liking are also covered but only the initial couple of seasons when this was starting. Humble Pie was published in 2006 so it obviously doesn't include TV shows and other events that have taken place since then.<br /><br />There is a shortened version of [[ASIN:0007270968 Humble Pie (Quick Reads)]] which was released two years later in 2008 as part of the Quick Reads short fiction and non fiction story initiative to increase global literacy.  If this full length version nearly three times as long at 284 pages seems a bit much for you, you might want to consider grabbing a copy of that instead, you should be able to get it for much cheaper price as well, it definitely will be a lot cheaper to post.

B004G600A4|4.0|Disney never disappoints! Or, at least, that's what I'm rediscovering now that my girls are getting at the age of watching a film all the way through. While \\"Tangled\\" doesn't surpass \\"Toy Story 3,\\" it comes in a close second. Especially among the animated fare this year. Super-cute Repunzel is a welcome princess to join the ranks of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Belle, Ariel, Tiana, Jasmine, Mulan and Pocahontas (can't you tell I have two young daughters?). There's plenty of romance for the girls, action for the boys and laughs for everyone! The music is OK (not as good as \\"Princess and the Frog\\"), but the film itself has a lot of heart. Also, Donna Murphy (who some might remember as the wife of Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) in [[ASIN:B00005JMQW Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)]]) is excellent as the newest villain, Mother Gothel. I did see this in 3-D (which I'm not too crazy about) and it was great, especially with my daughter reaching out for the floating lanterns. If you don't have kids, this movie could probably wait -- even though it's still enjoyable. But, if you have a kid, this movie is essential viewing ... and you won't be rolling your eyes and constantly checking your watch to see when it ends. That, in of itself, is a compliment to Disney animation and story!
0783225547|4.0|Had this movie on video cassette and liked it so much I bought a dvd.  Our entire family is entertained by this movie.  Nothing to be embarrassed about when watching with your children.
B004BLJQOK|3.0|Let me make this clear: This film is good, but the original (Swedish version) is GREAT! I would highly recommend the original (\\"Låt den r&auml;tte komma in\\"; US translation [[ASIN:B001MYIXAC Let The Right One In]]), directed by Tomas Alfredson, over this remake. The original delves more into the supporting characters whereas this focuses mainly on the boy (Smit-McPhee) and girl (Moretz), but still doesn't quite catch what the original does. Nevertheless, Moretz shines in this film and with her roles lately ([[ASIN:B002ZG983M Kick-Ass]], [[ASIN:B002ZG97F6 Diary of a Wimpy Kid]], [[ASIN:B001UV4XUG (500) Days of Summer]]), she's proving to be quite the young actress! This film proves that she can do drama with the best of 'em! Reeves does great with the directing but the screenwriting adaptation is something to be desired. Like I said, if you haven't seen the original and you're not up to reading subtitles in the original, then this will do. Otherwise, I highly recommend the original. Nevertheless, a great horror film that is more suspense thriller but still gives a good uneasy feeling.
0345522478|5.0|I was lucky enough to be able to read this book as an ARE (Advanced Reader Edition), and I highly recommend it as both a fast-paced urban fantasy adventure and a witty, snarky look at modern life through the eyes of a 2100 year-old druid.    The basic setup is that Atticus, the only druid from ancient Ireland still living and the sole possessor of the knowledge of druid magic, is hiding out in Tempe, Arizona from the pantheon of old Irish gods. Half of the gods want to kill him (he made enemies by stealing Fragarach from the alpha male head honcho a long time ago and has been on the run ever since) and the other half want to use him as a pawn in their power struggles and learn his secrets of long life and protection from magic. As the story begins, his whereabouts are uncovered - but instead of running, Atticus chooses to stand and fight. So begins what is promised to be a trilogy of adventure stories pitting Atticus against deities, witches, demons, and more.    The world, where the old gods have power proportional to the strength of their followers' beliefs, and where gods can appear in human-like form and expose themselves to mortal danger, is reminiscent of the world Neil Gaiman created in American Gods and Anansi Boys. However, Hearne has forged something really special here - a page-turning romp that is as full of action and suspense as it is humor and wit. You'll read the entire book in one sitting as the time flies by and be left thirsty for the next installment. I hope Hearne is a fast writer, because I can't wait for the rest of the series.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|\\"Unknown\\" is a wonderful suspense/thriller action-er that finds (the always excellent) Liam Neeson's Dr. Martin Harris fighting an identity crisis as another man (Quinn) has taken his identity after a car accident. There is a twist that I have to admit that I figured out fairly early in the film. However, that doesn't take away from the film. It all plays out very well. The movie is based on the French novel [[ASIN:014311901X Unknown: A Novel]] by Didier van Cauwelaert, and there is no lull in the film. This is probably the best suspense action film I've seen so far this year. Definitely a film that should've had much better reviews, \\"Unknown\\" delivers the action, drama and suspense that you want in a film.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was reluctant with the original Angry Birds because I didn't understand the hype, but afterward I caved and fell in love with the game! As soon as I saw that Rio was coming out, I had to get it, and I loved it. It definitely takes advantage of the power of the phones and looks pretty good. It's definitely something I play when I'm waiting or just bored. I'd recommend people to definitely get this version if they're Angry Birds fans, it's a great addition to the series.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|I was cautious when I first heard about this I was a little worried 'cause it looked a little similar to [[ASIN:B000M5B98A Running With Scissors]] (never read the book, but an AWFUL film) meets [[ASIN:B00006FDCP One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. Nevertheless, I gave it a try anyways, and I'm glad I did. GREAT film! This dramedy stars newcomer Keir Gilchrist, Zach Galifianakis (the funny guy from [[ASIN:B001UV4XEW The Hangover (Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray]]], who does such an amazing job with drama in this), and Emma Roberts (who does another surprisingly good job), along with the rest of the cast, create realistic, likeable characters you want to know. Based on the young adult novel by Ned Vizzini, the story follows 16-year-old Craig Gilner who admits himself into a psychiatric hospital ward to treat his depression. It's a coming-of-age story in a very unlikely setting, but, trust me, it's really good. It blends drama and comedy just right -- without being too silly or too melodramatic. I recommend this 2010 sleeper hit to anybody who's looking for a good, solid film and is tired of all the usual overpretentious or mind-numbing action films that are out there.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|I was never a big fan of the original [[ASIN:B004KPLVV8 Tron: The Original Classic (Special Edition)]] (it's an acquired taste). However, there was something about its sequel that made me want to see it (and, no, it wasn't Olivia Wilde -- although that didn't hurt). The story picks up about 21 years after Sam's (Garrett Hedlund) dad, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) disappears. Now the grown-up Sam finds a clue that may lead to his dad. That's when he enters the Grid, where he's soon accompanied by a program, Quorra (Wilde). Like [[ASIN:B004G600A4 Tangled]], I saw this film in 3-D. It was cool to see even though it doesn't usually make a difference to me (plus, seeing Wilde in 3-D wasn't so bad). I have to admit that I've never seen the attraction that most people have to Olivia Wilde, but this movie did work very much in her favor. She is extremely attractive and I liked the fact that her character wasn't some vampy sex kitten-type. Bridges shines as Flynn, who is almost like an offspring of the Dude from [[ASIN:B000A7DVR2 The Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]. He plays the part well and is able to prove his coolness and great acting ability all in this performance. My only gripe is that the computer-generated de-aging of Bridges as Clu seems a bit clunky during the movie, but, then again, Clu being only a computer program, maybe it's meant to look that way. \\"Tron: Legacy\\" may not appeal to everyone as it's very technical (I didn't know every technical aspect that was mentioned), but it's great entertainment.
B004XUDJII|4.0|This is a solid debut from Christina. The album as a whole matches exactly what her audience will enjoy, which is music about LOVE. Whether she is singing about heartbreak, \\"Tragedy,\\" or writing about finding love \\"Penguin,\\" she reaches into the heart of her listeners. Though every song might not strike each listener, the lyrics are what captured my attention. Perri finds a way to write poetry into her music. Many of these songs have emotional movement without music to them. What I enjoy most about this album is what I call the \\"tender moments.\\" There are moments on this debut where the music, lyrics, and vocals sweep you away and you feel like you are listening to a legend. IE. Linda Perry. One of the most tender moments are on the songs called 'Arms' and 'Distance.'I believe Perri is an amazing song writer and her passion for music is so evident in the body of work on this album. As a fan I am excited to see where she will go next with her music and style. I can see her developing and becoming even greater.
B002ZG97E2|4.0|A great cast, a great animated film that even adults will laugh at, and a heartwarming story that makes the film rewatchable = \\"Despicable Me.\\" This film's likeability ranks the same to me as [[ASIN:B002ZG97YM How to Train Your Dragon (Single Disc Edition)]]. Both are surprisingly great films and I could watch them over and over again (as you do when you have kids), but I could see myself beginning to glare over the movie and not being as interested or impressed with the story as I would with those Disney Pixar films (\\"Toy Story,\\" \\"Up,\\" \\"Finding Nemo,\\" \\"Monsters Inc.\\"). Regardless, \\"Despicable Me\\" is a good film that's funny and touching all in one. The humor even appeals to adults! And in today's cinema, that's something rare to come by, which makes it a treasure all its own.
B001JNNDGA|1.0|I was really quite surprised that Peter Jackson handed over the reigns to Mel Gibson for this installment of the Lost Tales of Middle Earth. I have to say he did not do anywhere near as good a job as Jackson. And I'm totally lost as to why he changed the names of so many characters and places. And who's bright idea was it to totally exclude Gandalf from the story?
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Just as [[ASIN:B00005JMJG Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)]] was a love story with a slightly different angle of sci-fi-type themes, \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is a sci-fi/suspense love story. It may seem a bit out there or far-fetched, but, trust me, it works! Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have amazing chemistry together; it's easy to root for these two as they take on the agency that's doing everything within their unlimited power to keep them apart. The movie, based on a story by Philip K. Dick (also responsible for [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0001NBNDY Paycheck (Special Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00005JL78 Minority Report (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00070FX5U Total Recall]], [[ASIN:B000JMK6LW A Scanner Darkly]], [[ASIN:0767810880 Screamers]], [[ASIN:B000TGJ8CQ Next]]), does well with its story and pacing. The acting is well done and it definitely has \\"multiple viewing\\" potential (especially for fans of Damon and Blunt). The great thing about this film, though, is not just the overall idea of the film, but also the questions that arise from such a film. Would you sacrifice a better life for your love? This film explores that idea with both sides being equally explored. \\"Adjustment Bureau\\" is one of the best of the year so far and highly enjoyable.
1601251505|5.0|Like many on here I gave 4e a fair shot. However, two things really bugged me.<br /><br />First, I had a heck of a time trying to convert my extensive 3.5 homebrew over to 4e. Some of 4e's concepts caused me to discard spells, feats, PrCs and homebrew classes that added flavor to my setting. I found that 4e's rules are not conducive to wordbuilding but only tactical combat. Role playing is no longer the primary experience of D&D. Combat rules supreme. It's Risk with a d20 now.<br /><br />Second, Essentials has turned my stomach like sour orange juice. I was willing to accept the heavy combat treatment of 4e and the add-on afterthought that are rituals but the abomination that is Essentials completely changed how I will spend my hard earned money from now on! The mistake known as Heroes of Shadow nailed the coffin shut for me on 4e or 4.5 or whatever it is now.<br /><br />Thank you Paizo for Pathfinder. This is one superb product you have. I am now converting my 3.5 homebrew over to Pathfinder (of course with very little effort!)and my zeal to write and create has returned!<br /><br />If some of you are rethinking 4e, maybe it's not all you thought it would be, come on over to Pathfinder. Paizo gets it! They understand gamers and rpg design in a way WotC has not forgotten but rather ignored!
B002ZG98C8|2.0|I wanted to like this film ... but it was just too over-the-top in trying to be \\"grindhouse.\\" I loved the Grindhouse films of [[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000R7HY0K Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], but this one -- despite its excellent cast -- just didn't do \\"it\\" for me. Especially shoddy was Jessica Alba who made me wonder if she really had to try hard to be that bad of an actress. The action is plentiful and the gore is hilarious; and I realize that that was Rodriguez's aim. However, there's something about it that I wasn't too taken with. There's absolutely no \\"rewatching\\" value to this film even though it delivers on the action. Whereas \\"Grindhouse\\" pulled off the cheesy acting along with the action superbly, \\"Machete\\" just feels like a wasted exercise in trying to reach the same goal. Plus, it hits a little too close to the real-life border wars that are going on right now in the south/Mexico. I'm not political at all which is why I think I didn't appreciate Rodriguez taking a political hot topic and using this film (of all films) to make his own political statement (albeit in a cheesy fashion: \\"We didn't cross the border! The border crossed us!\\") It's good for a rent but I wouldn't buy it!

B003UESJHO|4.0|Wow! I can see why Christian Bale and Melissa Leo won Oscars for their performances in this! Great movie that even though it's a pretty basic based-on-a-true-story plot still delivers the goods with emotion, acting and directing. Also, veteran character actor Jack McGee deserves a special shout-out as Micky Ward's (Wahlberg) dad, George Ward, in the film. As for Amy Adams, I remember when they announced she would Lois Lane for the new \\"Superman\\" film, and I felt disappointed and apprehensive. While I'm still unsure (I'd rather have Elizabeth Banks), she proves her mettle with this role! Bale especially shines as he doesn't act -- he IS Dicky Eklund! Even if you're not into boxing (although I respect the sport, I'm definitely not into watching it), you'll still enjoy this film. It's not so much about boxing but the lives of the Eklund/Ward family.

The devs claim compatibility with Vista, but I would aim to use an XP 32 PC if you can just in case.      /// Practise:    Once I got the EEC working, it was very simple to set up. The button mapping is clear and simple, and the advanced set-up for sensitivity and dead zone configuration was a lot easier than I'd thought it would be. The advanced set-up consists of tapping a designated key and scrolling the mouse wheel to secure a point with your in game cursor. It's really easy, and well explained via the provided instructions.    I set the device to work with Brink. It works very well. So well that my game's gone up about 50%. It's not quite PC accuracy, but it's a /lot/ better than attempting to be pin point with your thumbs.    There is a tricky learning curve, however, as you have to unlearn a little of what you know about mice.     If you use a mouse on a PC game, your avatar will turn at different speeds according to the speed with which you move the mouse, IE: if you move the mouse slowly, your character moves slowly; if you move the mouse quickly, your character will turn quickly. The analog sticks work to a set speed depending on where they're held, not how quickly you move them.    What this means is when you're using the EEC, if you snap your mouse for a quick 180 turn like you would for a PC title, the playstation registers only a brief tap on the analog and you will hardly move at all. If you make a long, steady sweep, the playstation will register this as the analog being held and you will move full speed.    So instead of playing with small sweeps and quick sharp movements like you might on a PC FPS, you have to make sure you hold your mouse grounded and make full gestures. It feels a little odd at first, perhaps \\"a little sticky\\" is the best way to describe it, but it'll become second nature in no time if you're an adept gamer (and I'd imagine you are if you're even considering a product like this).    Once you have the hang of it, the edge the EEC gives you is very noticeable. I'd be hesitant to use it in anything above semi-serious comp play in multiplayer as it really does feel like cheating at times.      The only other game I've tried it with so far is Mass Effect 2. It would be ideal for this game were it not for the weapon and power selection wheels. The wheels are mapped to the left anlaog stick, which can cater for more points of reference than the WASD format that the EEC uses for that control aspect. This means you can't access certain points on the command wheel.    Just beware of the control mechanics in game before you choose this for a specific title. If you're unsure, then a quick google using site:penguinunited.com as the prefix to a game title you're interested in will no doubt give you some information on whether the game's been mapped successfully for.    I would try out the other FPS I own, but I've had to give the XP laptop back to its owner. I will update my reivew in a month or so when I've had the chance to test it.       /// Overall:  - Build Quality - Average (Very generous USB lead)  - Ease of Installation - Unpredictable, but easy to follow guidelines (Xp machine recommended)  - Ease of configuration - Very simple and quick (requires access to the pc you installed on to change key maps)  - Functionality - Excellent (very noticeable increase in accuracy)    Summary - Even though it lacks in physical construction, it emulates the PC gaming experience very well indeed, and while not /as/ precise, the improvement is noticeable enough to justify the price. Highly recommended for FPS enthusiasts who struggle with analog controls.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|I think this gun is somewhat like the recon but the rang is so much better.this gun is not a wast of money.I also want to say that this gun is not for kids under 7.if you are a parent of a kid that likes nerf.get them the radier cs35 or the recon.I am a owner of a recon and let me tell you some thing.the recon is a little better than the radier but if you want a gun that can hold 35 dorts in a drum mag than buy the radier.so the long strike cs6 is a pretty good gun.I give it a 9.6 out of 10.
076781326X|1.0|I ordered this DVD in April, but should have viewed it before the 30 days limit to return it expired.  When I did finally open this DVD, I found that it didn't contain the whole movie!!  Plus the disc was scratched causing the movie to freeze.  This is not my first disapointment with movies from Amazon, but be assured, it is my last! I wont be ordering again!  I'd rather pay more and know I'm getting what I paid for!
0694003611|3.0|After hearing the glowing praise of this book by nearly every parent in the world, I was unimpressed. The phrases are random and outdated...even my 13 year old neice asked me what Mush was. The colors are murky and lack disctinction, so it makes it difficult to see in \\"getting-read-for-bed\\" light. Sweet but not as amazing as I had anticipated.
0440246016|2.0|I've read all of the previous novels. plus \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" in the early going. The latter will keep me aboard the Reacher bus despite the dip that \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" represents. I share the opinion of others regarding the weak plot and the struggle to finish it, but I'll add what annoyed me the most along the way, too many occasions where I must suspend disbelief:<br /><br />A woman who can break the neck of a 200+ pound muscled man while his patrolling partner awaits his turn at the same fate? Hardly.<br /><br />A store owner who decides to rob his customer (Reacher) at gunpoint over cash that is nothing compared to the store inventory. If he shoots Reacher he is prepared to deal with those consequences and risk his business and his future? If he fails to shoot Reacher, then...What... let him go for reinforcements?<br /><br />Breaking a password in a dozen attempts? Normally a mix of alpha and numeric characters, and often others, the chances are mighty slim with millions of attempts and miniscule, especially with the silly all-alpha tries.<br /><br />A company policy of destroying the hard disk after a user's session with a computer is quite a stretch. The average person knows that it would disable the computer. An expensive policy!<br /><br />I'm a numbers person too, and also compulsive about factoring and mental computation, but wouldn't include it in a novel where it is not relevant and will bore the readers. Also stating things like \\"757 was prime\\" bothers me. Past tense? It is and will forever remain prime.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|They really give Wall-E a personality.  The story is only ok, as far as plot lines go, but the animation makes it fun to watch over and over.  There is a certain charm that will win over most skeptics, but if you read to much into it you may feel it's too intense or sad.  For Pixar fans it's a must own.

B0000256VK|5.0|Roxy Music's Avalon is a landmark recording of the 1980s. The last studio release of the band, which came out in 1982, Avalon is just about as perfect as an album can possibly be. Through 10 tracks starting with the iconic and often covered More Than This, Bryan Ferry and company take the listener on an incredible, textured, rich musical journey. While more recent Ferry releases are all atmosphere and style, Avalon has the songs. Most of the music on Avalon was written by Bryan Ferry, while Andy MacKay and the incomparable guitarist Phil Manzanera are credited with three co-writes. At this stage, Roxy Music featured Bryan Ferry (keyboards and vocals), Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy MacKay (saxophone), Neil Hubbard (guitar), Alan Spenner (bass), Andy Newmark (drums), Jimmy Maclen (percussion) and Fonzi Thornton (background vocals). Avalon was recorded at the Powerstation in New York by longtime Roxy Music collaborators Rhett Davies and Bob Clearmountain. Every song here is a winner: More Than This, The Space Between, Avalon, India, While My Heart Is Still Beating, Take A Chance With Me, To Turn You On, True to Life and the closer Tara. In 2003 Virgin released a remastered version of Avalon on Hybrid Super Audio CD using surround sound. Davies and Clearmountain supervised the remastering process. I haven't heard the remaster -- so I can't comment on the differences in sound between the original release -- but will be getting it soon. No album collection is complete without Roxy Music's Avalon.
078324228X|4.0|I thought this movie started out slow. It took a while to grab my interest. Midway through, I was hooked. This story speaks to strength of character and the human spirit, stronger than any film I have viewed in a very long time. There were a few loose ends I would have liked to have seen tied up, but overall, a movie I would highly recommend. A good example that we can ALL reach out to others and have an impact on their lives.

We will just get the las season on Blu-ray when it shows up and then maybe replace the older seasons with Blu-ray.  Whe somthing like this shows up it is could a double dip and is all about the money Blu-ray will be out before long.
031261246X|4.0|I was very pleasantly surprised.  I know Mark from my years at Microsoft and therefore expected the novel to be accurate technically.  In that I was not disappointed.  As Howard Schmidt says in the Preface, this story could happen in real life and it's time we all paid attention to that fact.  It is especially time for system designers to pay attention.    What surprised me was the excellent plotting.  Technical expertise does not imply good writing ability and I hadn't known about Mark's writing.   So, I was really surprised and pleased.  Once the characters were established and the environment was solid, the pacing was masterful and I was reluctant to put the book down.  I was reading it on my Kindle - but also with the Kindle app on my Blackberry - and my stepdaughter was constantly complaining that I would walk down the street too slowly because I was engrossed in my reading. I really couldn't put it down.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is a full 20 channel GPS receiver. It even comes complete with Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) for aircraft as well (more accuracy for aircraft.) It works well with both the boat and the van navigation software. Just think, no more multiplexers to get the information to the laptop from the large GPS receiver on the boat.  Just plug in the USB, put the small antenna somewhere where it can 'see' the sky and start up your charting or mapping software .....

B004QPOVF0|4.0|What a great concert.  I was lucky enough to see them 3 times on the Black Ice tour.  This concert DVD has really good sound and the pictures are crystal clear.  But, my goodness, it's almost painful to watch.  While they had 32 cameras I don't think they used them well at all in the final product.  No scene holds for more than a couple of seconds.  It bounces around all the time.  Oh, sure, you get Angus for a good amount of time but how many times do I need to see the crowd?  Come on guys.  I was really hoping, with that many cameras, that we'd be able to choose, at least sometimes, which camera angle to watch.  But, they didn't include that.  Instead, it's a very jumpy production.  And, way way way too much of the crowd shots.  I bought the DVD to see the band, not the crowd.  Spend a little time with the different angles.  I loved the one from behind Phil.  But, no, it's 1 second of that angle and then a cut to the crowd, and then then 1 second on Malcolm and back to the crowd.  This could have been soooo good.  Still 4 stars cuz the show was great and it sounds good.

0596805527|5.0|I was provided access by O'Reilly Publishing to an electronic copy of this book for review purposes.<br /><br />This is an updated edition to the classic reference book on Javascript to include new information on new standards (such as HTML5 and CSS3), conventions, and frameworks.  Although it is possible to learn Javascript from this book, its really meant more as a reference guide and an explanation of how and why Javascript works the way it does.  For example, the 1st chapter explains in some detail how Javascript works on the client side and how each of the following chapters will relate to this.  The book includes numerous examples of codes to illustrate the concepts and explains the concepts in a clear, easy to follow fashion that doesn't require a degree in astrophysics to understand.<br /><br />As I said it's not really a book to learn Javascript from, for that I would recommend something like \\"[[ASIN:0596527748 Head First JavaScript]]\\" (also by O'Reilly press.)  What I do really like about this book is that it is comprehensive in what is possible with Javascript.  While it may not cover the concept in depth, such as the chapter on Jquery, it does give a starting point to the concept.  I know it sounds odd, but I really liked the index.  It is completely through and easy to find the concept or word that I need to make something work correctly in whatever I'm writing.  It's even better with the book because of the hyperlinks that take you right to the section.<br /><br />My advice? Buy the ebook version, it's much easier to search and to follow to specific links vs. trying to find the stuff in the print edition.  Even better, O'Reilly provides multiple formats of the book to suit your needs.  Overall, it's a good handy reference to have around to answer questions and introduce new concepts.
030726999X|5.0|Absolutely spell binding. Third in the trilogy, probably not as good as the first two, because of endless characters and Swedish names. You must ignore the Swedish map names, unimportant to plot. Cant help with all the characters, must muddle thru that.  But, just a wonderful book, sad that there will be no more.
B004LUS390|1.0|On my evo 4g, this app. was one of my favorites, until one day it was updated, and from that point on, it crashes at launch. I'm very disappointed that there hasn't been a patch to fix it, as it is apparent from other reviews that I'm not the only one with this issue.

B0041EVYVK|3.0|This album has some real gems, which are catchy and which you can't get out of your head. Trixie's voice is beautiful and the recording is nothing less than you would expect from Lanois, very well done. The instrumental tracks are a little self-indulgent, but die hard Lanois fans will still love them I am sure. I think it is a great evolution for Lanois' music and his choice of singer was great. Whitley does lack a little feeling and her tone is repetitive, but the talent shines through regardless. The musicians he has chosen are clearly from the cream of the crop. In the end, you will enjoy this album if you are a music lover.  If you expect catchy pop tunes, you will be disappointed.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|3 Main Things:<br /><br />1. They sound better than any other headphone I've had the opportunity to try.<br /><br />2. They need to be paired with an adequate amplifier for best results.<br /><br />3. They can get a little bit uncomfortable with extended use.<br /><br />It's been a few months since I've purchased these bad boys, so I figured it was about time to post my thoughts (although I still haven't hit the end of the break-in period yet).  The AKG K702s are absolutely fantastic headphones.  They offer the best sound I've ever heard in any headphone, and I've had the privilege to sample more than a few high-end sets.<br /><br />The sound is very clean, first off.  Assuming that you have paired them with an adequate source of amplification and are starting with high quality files or music source, the K702s have absolutely no detectible distortion up to extremely high volume levels (the kind that are probably damaging to your hearing).  Secondly, the sound is very discernable.  Each spectrum is nicely sectioned off and allows for full appreciation of every piece of the sound spectrum from the very very lows to the extremely high trebles.  I have found, however, that increasing the bass level on my amplifier leads to the best overall listening experience.<br /><br />They simply demand adequate amplification.  When used with a low-power audio source like an iPod, these cans just simply can't get loud enough and are pretty much wasted.  You'd be better off with a lower-end, yet less power-hungry set for that sort of setup.  If your main use is going to be mobile, I'd suggest looking somewhere else.  But, if you do have an adequate amplifier for the majority of your use, there is simply no better option at this price.<br /><br />Lastly, they do get a bit uncomfortable with extended use.  Although I put up with it for the outstanding sound quality and have gotten used to it to some degree, I still notice the pressure that the K702s put on the top of my head.  I am not sure how any of these drawbacks could be mitigated by a better design... it might just be an intractable problem with headphones of this size.<br /><br />Edit: I have mitigated the comfort issue by rubber-banding a sweatband onto the piece that rests on your head.  Still sounding great, still highly recommend.<br /><br />P.S. Purchase experience on Amazon was pain free.  Opted for the 2-day shipping and they arrived in 1.sure how any of these drawbacks could be mitigated by a better design... it might just be an intractable problem with headphones of this size.<br /><br />Edit: I have mitigated the comfort issue by rubber-banding a sweatband onto the piece that rests on your head.

B0037KMHRY|3.0|I loved the movie and have nothing but good things to say about it. I love Daft Punk, I have liked and listened to them for years. But this particular CD, Im really not a fan of. The music in the movie seemed great and all that jazz. I couldn't wait to get it so i bought it the other day at best buy and listened to it on the way home. I was rather disappointed in it. There was maybe five out of the 22 tracks that are worth listening to. All the others are either really short, or it seems the song was really slow and didn't get anywhere before the next track. I guess I should have bought the Tron: Legacy Reconfigured CD instead. The songs are longer even tho its only 15 tracks verses 22, but for the money Id rather have a whole CD with less songs worth listening to, than a CD with a lot of tracks that only has a few good songs.

There are no true knights in the story.  This isn't the way people should behave!  There is no one in the book to admire!<br />Littlefinger: Not even your father?<br />Sansa:  Yes, my father is probably the most honorable person in the book.  And even there, the author keeps dwelling on his fathering a bastard.  One mistake in his life-<br />Littlefinger: Ah, no, one mistake?  Hardly.  Insisting on a rigid morality, or \\"honor,\\" as you put it, is itself a mistake, in a world such as ours.  To survive, you need pay attention to which way the wind's blowing.<br />Sansa: So you just drift along with the wind, willy-nilly, is that it?  That's no way to live.<br />Littlefinger: No, to steer a ship, you have to work with the wind, not against it.  It's a \\"ship\\" metaphor, not a \\"leaf\\" metaphor.  My point is that the book depicts people as they really are.<br />Sansa: But the book is supposed to be a fantasy.  It says so on the spine.  Even assuming that people \\"really are\\" this way, I read fantasy to get away from reality.  If I wanted to know about reality, I'd watch the evening news.<br />Littlefinger: Careful, you're getting out of character.  It all depends on what you want from a novel, that's true.  If you want intricate plots with a large cast of three-dimensional characters, I've seen few series which do it better.<br />Sansa: Series?  You mean I have to read those as well?<br />Littlefinger: Maybe the author will find someone else to do his reviews for him.<br /><br />Warning: This series is incomplete.  May cause Martin Derangement Syndrome in people with high impatience.  Do not read while operating heavy machinery.
B000NQRE0K|4.0|Please describe the audio/video quality when you review a Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The video quality of this Blu-Ray is very good, great at times.  But, parts of the movie didn't look very good.  Some scenes had grain (mostly in the background, but some in the faces).  Some scenes didn't even look like a Blu-Ray should look.  Most of the movie looked \\"high-def\\", but some of it didn't.  Overall, I give it 9.0 to 9.5, on a scale from 1-10.  I am not disappointed, nor do I feel \\"ripped off\\" with the video quality, like I have with other movies.  I just don't think it is as good as more recent movies, and I wouldn't call it \\"excellent.\\"<br /><br />The audio quality could have been better.  It was Dolby TrueHD 5.1, but most of the sound came from the center speaker, with some coming from the front left and right speakers.  I had to walk right up to my surround speakers to hear any sound.  I didn't notice any surround sound from where I was sitting.  And, most of the sounds from the battle scenes came out of the center speaker.  There wasn't much battle sound coming from the front left and right speakers. If I stood right next to the front speakers, I could hear swords clashing - but it wasn't very loud.  There also wasn't much sub-woofer bass, although I thought I could hear it at times.<br /><br />Before you criticize my review, watch it again on Blu-Ray, and pay attention to the audio and video quality.<br /><br />This is not one of my favorite movies, even though it is good.  I enjoy Mel Gibson's \\"The Patriot\\" movie more.  One thing I didn't catch, is what happened to John Wallace (William's brother)?  I thought he was the young kid who punched young William at the beginning of the movie, but, he suddenly disappeared from the movie. Was he in the movie as an adult?  I thought young William could have killed John for punching him, but I replayed that part, and it didn't show any evidence of that.  The movie credits at the end had a young William, and a William, but only a John Wallace (no young or old John).ohn).

0553584537|5.0|I downloaded this onto my kindle a few months back but just got around to reading it.  The beginning started out slow for me because she focused on different characters, which was confusing at first because I kept wondering who the book was about.  Well, as soon as she connected the dots between the characters the story took off.  And, boy did it.  There is a twist, turn or new secret to reveal right up to the very end of the book.  It had me sitting on the edge of my seat.    Bobby Dodge is a sharp shooter who takes out Catherine Gagnon's husband, Jimmy, while on duty.  The only problem is that Jimmy Gagnon was the son of a crooked judge.  The judge wants to have Dodge tried for murder.  He also insists that Catherine set the entire thing up so Jimmy would be killed.  Catherine has a sickly 4 yr old son, who the grandparents claim, is being abused by Catherine.  That's all I'm going to say because to tell you anything else would be to tell you far too much.  The author takes the reader on a fast paced journey while Bobby Dodge and Catherine Gagnon try to clear their names.    The only caveat I have is that far too many people got killed in this novel.  She could have gotten away with killing three people and the story would have had the same impact.    I'm downloading her other books today.
0316926345|4.0|I did a \\"cold\\" reading of this novel; that is to say, I read it without having seen the film version or even having read a synopsis of the plot. All I knew was that I wanted to read an Evelyn Waugh novel, and this one seemed to be most well known and well respected of the bunch.     This was quite a good read. The narrator's voice is laced with humor as well as quiet reflection, and he captivated me from the beginning. The first half of the novel, chronicling Charles Ryder's friendship with an eccentric young aristocrat, is the better half -- entertaining, original, quirky, unexpected. The second half takes the novel in a more conventional direction (though there was still plenty to keep me going).    Beyond the social commentary and homoerotic undertones which are often central to people's analyses of the novel, Brideshead Revisited is first and foremost just a good read -- a detailed character study, a portrait of a family, a view into another world.
B000BNI90O|5.0|My technical knowledge doesn't compare to many of the other reviews, so I'll simply write this as a fan of music and keep it short.  I am a huge fan of the movies and extended editions. I think the the movies owe a great deal of their success to this music. Sure, they put a LOT of work into every other aspect of production, and it shows. But without a great score the visuals can be left feeling lackluster. Like any good soundtrack it leaves a connection between what you saw and what you heard. Just hearing the music can evoke all the imagery and emotion portrayed in the three movies. I really like that the tracks include the little stuff, like the songs the cast performed about the Green Dragon and Pippin's song for Denethor.    The boxes these come in our awesome as well. Tons of information about the music and musical themes. And they make good decorations.    Easily my favorite soundtrack to date! I can only hope that Howard Shore is returning to work on The Hobbit.

0307272702|4.0|I purchased this book after becoming aware of it through a friend.  It has changed my life.    I am a Type 1 diabetic...a new diabetic...two years in.  I was diagnosed later in life at 38.  Becoming a diabetic is a lifestyle change in and of itself immediately...if you choose to manage it and manage it well.  In my research and asking questions of my doctors and diabetes educators, I still felt that I didn't know the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" of it all.  Simply, why must I give myself insulin...based on counting the carbs in what I'm eating....and what is actually happening in my body?  This book finally answered my questions.  I am forever grateful that Gary Taubes wrote this book.    The first half of the book is historical...and then, very scientific.  I will admit, it was difficult to get through.  But, so worth it once you get past all the groundwork he lays, so that you have the knowledge to put it all to use after you've completed the book.      This author, Gary Taubes, is a scientist.  He's not a physical trainer trying to sell you a diet.  It''s not a marketing ploy to get you to then buy a product.  He provides the reader with a wealth of information about how carbs, insulin, and fats are used by the body along with the idea of a lifestyle change...to keep from getting fat.    One of the most interesting books I've read in a long time.
B003498SDA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and whenever I watch it I'm always completely immersed in it. Tom Cruise gave an outstanding performance as Vincent, and Jamie Foxx surprised me as well. This movie is an incredible thriller with amazing dialogue and story. Michael Mann did a great job with his work on this. The disc contains a nice amount of extras: There's a deleted scene, the enlightening directors commentary, a few making of's, and some other things. If you like the movie you'll be more than satisfied, and if you haven't seen it before you won't be disappointed.

I'm not a military person so I have no basis of relativity here but suffice it to say I am proud to be an American and have guys such as this doing what they do best.<br /><br />I read this book in one day.  Start to finish.  I couldn't put the thing down.  It's that intriguing.  You often hear about the SEALs but never really get to hear stories (or at least I don't) about the operations they go on.  Yeah, they're dangerous but that's about all you get.  You hear about their training and how they've gone through hell and back and the need to prepare but you don't really understand why.  Maybe that's just me being a naive civilian (I'm sure other military folks understand firsthand) but I can tell you, reading this book gave me a much different perspective on what an \\"operation\\" is.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a military buff.  I've thought the military is absolutely something we need but this book isn't about rah-rah-rah go America, it's about the journey of one man - Marcus Luttrell - from his pre-training days, through the BUD/S training, then right on into Operation Redwing which brought him and his team into one of the most fierce battles I've ever read or heard about.<br /><br />This story makes you want to cheer and cry at the same time.  I turned the last page and was awestruck.  Proud to be part of a country where Service, Loyalty, Honesty and Integrity still mean something and that we have a duty to thank and remember our military service members.<br /><br />Coming face-to-face with Taliban and having to survive - sometimes with a bit of luck (maybe this is a higher power watching down, who knows) - six days in the backcountry, seeing your team members KIA, I can't even imagine it.  Marcus Luttrell and his fallen comrades deserve every ounce of respect, including those still serving.<br /><br />For those reading this, should you buy this book?  Absolutely.  I can say without a doubt it's a nail-biting, page-turning, harrowing experience that I think every person should read.  Doesn't matter which side of the political fence you sit on, all political BS aside, everyone should read this - it's a perspective that only comes from someone who's experienced it firsthand.<br /><br />No one likes war and reading this isn't about agreeing or disagreeing with Iraq, Afghanistan or the wars to come, it's about understanding what it takes to do what it takes to survive, to never give up, to have the courage and strength both physically and mentally to do what you have to do.  Sometimes we get caught up in our own little battles in our own little world but all it takes is something like this story to really give you a true perspective on things.<br /><br />Turning the last page (and seeing the pictures at the end, and I wish there were more of them), made me reaffirm that my family, wife and kids are the most important things in my life and that I love this country.  We fight because there are those who will try and take it away if we don't.  Never give up.<br /><br />So, now that I've stepped off my soapbox, would I buy this book.  Oh yeah I would.that I think every person should read.

B000R4SMCW|5.0|Imagine your chagrin if you happen to be a young, bright, arrogant-with-good-reason Assistant District Attorney who quits his steady job to take a new position with the high-powered law firm of his dreams, only to find himself stuck at the last minute before departure with a guilty client (Anthony Hopkin) who is smarter than he is and proving it at every turn.      The cast is superior, the cat-and-mouse dialog extremely witty.  Anthony Hopkin as the brilliant scientist accused of murder, Ryan Gosling as the young Assistant DA who finds himself suddenly mired down with a scary client in full command and in the drivers seat; and David Strathairn as the long-suffering DA juggling not only the unexpected departure of his \\"Assistant\\" which leaves him in the lurch, but protocol, public opinion and (hopefully) justice for a murder victim breathing down his neck as well.     The story line is inspired.  But the viewer will have to wait another day to see the \\"perfect murder\\" committed on screen - even though it seems almost assured that this film will be the one to do it.  I also appreciated the unusual script layout - you know who did it and how; there were no moments of importance that whizzed by while you were still trying to figure out what had just happened in the last flashback.  Yet you did not know what would come next - but whatever it was, you knew it wasn't going to be easy for poor Ryan Gosling.

0670022411|5.0|I have had this book on my Kindle for a while and wasn't in a huge rush to start it.  After running out of more interesting options, I finally gave in and started. I am so glad I did!  Loved the characters and the story!  I think my hesitancy was caused by my thought that it was a historical novel...not a huge draw for me. The reason I bought the book was the witches and vampires story line as I typically read paranormal/paranormal romance/mystery books. I would call this a paranormal romance with class. The story is well thought out and the historical references are very interesting - though not so plentiful and detailed that you need to be a scholar to enjoy. I think the story moves at a quick pace and I was unable to put it down. I was a little stumped by the somewhat mixed bag of reviews on Amazon - then I noticed the 'other books purchased by people who purchased this book'. Absolutely none of them interested me. I think that the synopsis of the book, along with the details given on the authors career as a historian, and all of the non fiction recommendations by the author may have lead people to believe this is a much different type of story than it is. While somewhat lengthy, I think its still a quick read type book - a good escape, engrossing, but not too deep. I am eagerly anticipate g the next in the series!

0060899220|5.0|Kitchen Confidential is a riot.  You can even hear the author's unmistakable voice as you read it (I'm a big fan of his travel/food show, No Reservations).  Whenever I go to restaurants and see the cooks and the wait staff working hard, I always think of his book.  The book reads quickly and is really cheap on Kindle.  On a more serious note, underneath all the joking around, the book does lay open the restaurant business and does cover several serious issues, such as dealing with the death of an employee that he fired, appreciating people for who they are, and appreciating good food!  Every culinary student reads this book like the Bible.
0312370849|4.0|I recently finished reading Sarah's Key, by Tatiana de Rosnay.      For longer than I can remember, there has been a tender place in my heart for the victims of the Holocaust and I am always amazed at the resilience of its survivors.    I love when I have the opportunity to learn something new about true events, especially of those I have never known, while reading historical fiction.  This tragic event in Paris that took place in 1942 - The Vel' d'Hiv - is something that has left a mark on my mind, heart and soul that I believe will be there for quite some time.    Knowing Sarah as only `the Girl' until almost a third into the book, contributed to being able to feel the unworthiness this 10 year old girl felt, especially before she was cared for and safe once more.  Although this caring and safety did not take away the anguish of her loss and guilt she was unable to let go of for the remainder of her life.    The contrast between trivial problems of the American Journalist, Julia compared to the critical problems of Sarah, as well as between the other victims of The Vel' d'Hiv and the French people, give light to the heart of mankind more than we would probably like to admit.    This book is compelling - I highly recommend it.
0385732554|5.0|I picked this book up to read because I had heard it is a wonderful dystopian novel.  It definitely was a great, if disturbing, read.  I am very pleased that I finally got around to reading it.<br /><br />Jonas was born into a world were couples are perfectly matched and each are given one boy and one girl.  The children are given medication starting at twelve years old that stifles any emotional urges and then are placed in work positions most appropriate to their disposition.  Jonas is different though, no one can guess what work he will be placed in.  Then he finds out that he will be the society's new Receiver of Memory; the one person in society who doesn't have to follow any of the rules and is responsible for the memories of humanity.  The old man who give Jonas these memories is forced to revel dangerous truths about their society to Jonas, they are truths that are truly stunning.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book.  It was easy to read and very well set up, the whole time you suspect that things aren't quite right but when the truth is revealed it is stunning.  Much of the book reminded me of Huxley's [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]].  Jonas is an excellent character and watching him transition from one of the ignorant masses to an enlightened individual is both painful and fascinating.<br /><br />This is a short book, but it packs a lot of story and that story has a truly powerful punch to it.  I found my self stunned and almost in tears at parts; so while this was not necessarily an easy read, it was definitely a thought-evoking and memorable one.  I zipped through it quickly and found it very hard to put down.  It is hard to talk about more of the plot without giving things away; but if you find dystopians fascinating and are intrigued by humans adopting sameness for safety you will find this book wonderful.<br /><br />My least favorite part of the book was the very end, which is incredibly ambiguous.  As a reader you know what probably happens, but you are hoping something else actually happened.<br /><br />Overall this was just an absolutely fascinating read.  It is creative and engaging and impossible to put down.  It does pull some things from Huxley's a [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]].  If you like this book or are looking for other excellent young adult dystopian reads I recommend the following: [[ASIN:0062024027 Divergent (Divergent Trilogy)]] by Veronica Roth, [[ASIN:0525423648 Matched]] by Ally Condie, [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] by Suzanne Collins, and [[ASIN:1442409053 Wither (The Chemical Garden Trilogy)]] by Lauren DeStefano.ctually happened.

B0007P0XNC|5.0|Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni 1977<br /><br />The Rally for Hitlers visit with Mussolini in Fascist Rome Italy provides the back drop for a chance encounter between two neighbors from across an italian palazzo. Though only a courtyard apart, they live in two different worlds;  one of an unappreciated housewife; and the other of a lonely bachelor.  This special day brings together a man who feels less a man, and a woman who feels less a woman and in the course of that day,  the two manage to navigate uncomfortable sexual attraction, rejection, politics and a snoopy old land lady.  This is a loving film about how people in the midst of a huge building full of people, and the fascist fervor that often looses the individual, manage to find some heart felt honesty after the polite facade drops, and they confront their inner shadows, and share them with each other.  Given the subject matter, and that this was made in 1977, it was fairly ahead of its time, and both actors give two of their most lovely performances.  Pay no attention to the critics who can't see past a pour DVD transfer, or the dubbing; yes a better copy would be wonderful; yes, if it was in italian with subtitles it might be even better, but once you get past all that, you will find that these two seasoned actors will take you on a subtle ride into their hearts and minds, and make you remember that in a crowd there are real people, with real stories.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|\\"Wasting Light\\" by the Foo Fighters is an extremely well put together rock album. I do admit that I enjoy all the songs on this album, but I chose to listen to listen to this cd multiple times before reviewing this in order to gain a deeper understanding of the songs.  I only say this because all eleven of the songs on \\"Wasting Light\\" are metaphorical masterpieces that are meant to be understood more from a creative level, rather than interpreting these songs literally. The following are my personal interpretations of a few of these good musical tracks (that stood out for me) in order to assist others reading this with making the decision to purchase \\"Wasting Light\\" by the \\"Foo Fighters\\":<br /><br />\\"Rosemary\\": This touching musical number appears to be about someone that was very much loved, and still a spiritual and emotional part of the singer.  However, this song seems to be about wishing to release this person that they very much cared about in order to make a \\"clean break\\" due to strong continual feelings.<br /><br />\\"A Matter of Time\\": This song appears to be about the inevitable changes that are about to take place in a person's life, and their choice to come to terms with accepting and making peace with these shifts.<br /><br />  My two overall favorite songs on \\"Wasting Light\\" by the Foo Fighters are \\"Arlandria\\" and \\"Walk\\".  \\"Walk\\" is currently my overall favorite musical gem that appears to be about turning over a more joyful transition to an even happier and more improved life, and looking forward to embracing whatever may come, and creating new experiences. \\"Arlandria\\" is a great song about a person's journey in coming to terms with their newfound and increasing experiences of popularity and spiritual evolution that are simultaneously taking place.<br /><br />  The best litmus test to determine if you are going to enjoy this cd is if you have listened to and have enjoyed \\"Learn to Fly\\" and \\"Everlong\\" (because \\"Wasting Light\\" is created in the similiar creative spirit as these songs).  In addition, \\"Wasting Light\\" is very much a worthwhile purchase if you enjoy modern rock/alternative rock.se songs).

0525422943|5.0|I'll be honest. When I first read If I Stay, I liked it, but I didn't love it. I didn't really understand all the hype. Fast forward 1 week later. I was still thinking about the book, how heartbreaking and beautifully written it is. That's when realized that If I Stay is one of those books that, even though you can finish it in a day, it might take a little longer for you to truly absorb everything.<br /><br />Now, onto Where She Went. This one, to me, is a little bit different. It didn't take me a week to fall in love with it. Instead, it only took me 50 pages before I was so wrapped up in the story, I didn't even know what time or day it was. Adam's voice is so heart wrenching, strong and painful, yet relatable and enticing, all at the same time. I liked Mia's point of view, but I LOVED Adam's.<br /><br />From the summary, you know Adam and Mia have gone down different paths. It's been three years since either of them spoke to one another, let alone seen each other. Now, in the city that doesn't sleep, both are reunited. Whether that's a good thing or bad thing, you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />Both books kind of remind me of the movies Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (best romantic movies ever!). So much time has passed by, and so many things have happened since both characters left off, but one thing is for sure. The chemistry between Adam and Mia is undeniable.<br /><br />Adam is definitely on my list of favorite swoon-worthy boys. In fact, I'm writing him on my list with a sharpie because I honestly don't think there will be a time where I don't love Adam. His passion, his fears, his heart, his charm...wow. Sometimes, I like to doodle his name in my journal. I'm kidding. Maybe.<br /><br />Anyway, a question I'm sure a lot of readers (especially those who haven't read If I Stay) are wondering is \\"Do I have to read the first book first?\\". I don't think you need to read If I Stay to enjoy Where She Went, but I do think both are better paired together. Some of the conversations and events will just make more sense and have more meaning if you read If I Stay first.<br /><br />Overall, I really adored Where She Went. If you're a fan of If I Stay, just wait until you read Where She Went. It didn't have me in tears like If I Stay did, but it did give me butterflies, and left me with hope,warmth, and a little bit giddy.and events will just make more sense and have more meaning if you read If I Stay first.

B00006I53S|3.0|I got this lens as the kit lens with my 50D. For the first month or so, I was pretty disappointed with the quality of images from it. Specifically, indoor available light shots were not impressive.  Outdoor shots looked very good.  As I started getting into strobist-style shooting, I became much happer with the lens.  The problem is that while the specs claim that this is a F3.5 lens, its only that for a tiny range at the widest zoom (28mm) and it rapidly drops to F5.6.  The lens is far slower than its label and size imply.<br /><br />It also suffers from lens creep, it will self zoom to 135mm when hanging over your shoulder.<br /><br />For me, the biggest downside is that the range, 28-135 would be great on a full frame camera, but it is not as good on a crop sensor camera like my 50D. 135mm is a long telephoto, and I don't have much use for it. It could have been useful for indoor sports, but at F5.6 it is simply way too slow. Similarly, 28mm on a Canon crop sensor is equivalent to 45mm on a full frame. It is more of a normal lens than wide angle. For candid shots in normal houses, the widest setting, 28, is simply too long.<br /><br />So its a good lens if you have a lot of light and a fair amount of room. Its far higher in both build and image quality compared to the $150 kit 15-55 used by cheaper Rebels.  But modern enthusiast-level Canons like the 50D and 60D, let alone the 7D, really deserve better glass.

She has trouble shifting the first time through most of the book and she finally is able to is a big surprise.<br />2. The male protagonist is a Dragon Wyr (aka Dragos).

Maneuvering inter-politics in the \\"Dragon Skyscraper Headquarters\\".<br /><br />You might not like this book if you don't like:<br />1. Lots of descriptive sex scenes... But these seemed somewhat meaningful. Unfortunately, she has commitment issues that make these scenes somewhat tiring.<br />2. The goblin soldiers were more evil than the main bad guy. Seemed he was a little weak.<br />3. There were some incredibly girly/cheesy for me plot developments... for example: What Pia eventually can turn into, was a bitter pill for me to swallow. Also, the birth control method was not very original or realistic.<br />4. My last criticism is the cover. Come on... 1. He can't just sprout wings and fly off like an angel, he has to actually change completely into a dragon. 2. He has longish straight black hair that whips in the wind, not a buzz cut.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fun book that was a quick read for me. I can see how others might compare this to the Singh's \\"Angel's Blood\\", but I felt that Elena's character a little more consistent, but Dragos's character in this book was a little more novel than Raphael's. So it all evens out.

B003Q6D25K|4.0|Sequels for horror films are normally and creatively the bottom of the barrel.  The formula for slasher and gore films was tiresome in 1982--and here we are decades later and the studios who had nothing to do with slasher films are making them!<br /><br />What I liked about PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was how footage was put together and the audience had to study over shot carefully.  When was the last time you paid that much attention to a security camera looking at an empty room?  And yet we were looking for something that wasn't really there...but it was.  And that's scary.<br /><br />So PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 wisely does the same thing AND develops a related story that includes the first film's characters.  I thought that was smart.  And it explained why the demonic presence was targeting Katie in the first film.<br /><br />So if you liked the first film, you'll probably like this one.  And if the filmmakers can keep their creative streak going, I'd even check out another sequel.

B000KQGOA4|4.0|Karajan's recording of Holst's The Planets with the Vienna Philharmonic from 1961 has been a favorite of collectors for decades. Indeed, the performance is quite good, although I do not agree with those who consider it the best ever The Planets. Karajan is at his best building pulse-pounding excitement in Mars, Bringer of War and also does a great job with the nightmarish scherzo that is Uranus. His Neptune is brisker than many, making for a more compelling listening experience. The two slower movements before Jupiter are well-played by the VPO and provide the necessary soothing after the brutish force of Karajan's Mars. Jupiter is a bit of a mix: the big tune is played triumphantly but it lacks the sentimentality of many other recordings, both British and non-British. The second theme of the movement (which precedes the big tune and makes a reprise toward the end) is taken too fast, as Gramophone noted in its review of the original LP. It's not terrible but it does detract from the coherence of this movement. Saturn too is a mix: it is loud and exciting at times but taken too fast and missing the mystery that the greatest performances have. What are they? Well, only one qualifies for near-perfection: Dutoit/Montreal, also on Decca, recorded in 1986. Dutoit reveals all layers of mystery in this suite. His Mars is not quite as brutal as Karajan's but it's pretty powerful nonetheless. Dutoit's Jupiter is absolutely perfect: spot-on tempos, sentimental but not schmaltzy, a thrilling climax that doesn't unnaturally speed up toward the end of the movement, like Karajan and especially Mehta (with the LAPO, from 1971, also Decca) do. Dutoit's Saturn, taken at nearly a minute and a half longer than Karajan, reveals the power and mystery of the movement like no other performance. There are other great performances, especially those by Boult (for sound considerations, try his 1979 recording), but Dutoit is the best of them all.     The main reason for writing this review, though, isn't to point out any flaws in Karajan's execution since, at the end of the day, Karajan's performance still stands as one of the greats. (Just don't let it be your only recording). The biggest issue is the 1961 sound quality: although remastered with 96/24 technology, it still sounds somewhat recessed and dry. The blaring brass which you know are there for the climax of Mars sound like they're kind of in the background. Interestingly, the strings fare better throughout this recording. What's the point of noting deficiencies in an early 1960s recording, you ask? Well, because there are other recordings from the same period that are far superior. Take anything from the Mercury Living Presence series and (to a lesser extent) the RCA Living Stereo series and you'll see how those sound much more full-bodied and warm than Karajan's.     As for Don Juan, I have no complaints: Karajan was probably the best Strauss conductor out there and this, one of about five recordings Karajan made of this piece, is as brash and romantic as you could ask for. The playing is full of gusto and the performance has a coherence sometimes lacking in this work. Even the sound is better than The Planets, despite being from a year earlier (1960). An easy first choice for the Strauss. But for The Planets, although this is a keeper, don't think you're getting the best of the best, since the performance and especially the sound, could be a lot better.
0393327655|5.0|Together with Richard Dawkins he stands as a beacon peering deep into the abyss that religion has wrought upon this world and us. This book is the most forthright and to the point explanation of just how messed up religion is and its affects upon the human condition.
0670022411|2.0|Wait for the paperback. Very slow read. Interesting, but not enthralling. Ending leads to an obvious sequel, if you like a book in which the conflict is not resolved. Historical alchemical allusions were interesting but the writing is not top notch.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Holds true to the book.  It might be confusing for some who haven't read the book but it's still great. It's a must see movie and an incredibly gripping story. It's so sad it will bring tears to your eyes but so worth it.

044654759X|5.0|Nicholas Sparks - a genre of his own. Sweet love stories with an added element of drama. I have laughed and cried in every one of his books. I have been made fun of for reading his books, but I will always be a fan of Sparks' books.<br /><br />A woman who has a rough past has relocated to a small town in NC outside of Wilmington to start a new life. She gets a job at a local restaurant and starts renovating a cottage on the beach. After living in this small town for awhile, she falls in love with a man with two kids who lost his wife due to a disease.<br /><br />As my sister was advised, if you get two thirds of the way through this book, you should sit and finish it. The last 70 pages are hard to put down - so make time to finish it one sitting. I am not sure the men would enjoy this one or most of his books, but the ladies will definitely enjoy this tender and dramatic read.
0316056863|5.0|If you don't know about Tina Fey, you are missing out!  She is the best female comedic writer of our times. Not  just the book, but everything she does.  If you like to  laugh out loud, you better whip out that card and  buy this!!!!
0525422943|5.0|What an amazing book that continued the story from If I Stay by Gayle Forman, which ended abruptly. A story told by her point of view as she is in the hospital after a major car accident, the first book kept me flipping pages well into the night and the same went for the sequel. I read it one day - 3 sittings.<br /><br />Told from Adam, her boyfriend's, point of view. I absolutely loved that we heard the continuation of the story 3 years after the first book ended from a different perspective. And rarely do we hear a guy's point of view, so I had to remind myself a few times that we were in Adam's head. But I loved it - the twists and turns which kept me glued until the very end.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to young and old alike. I am physically handing this book off to my mom and would recommend it for the majority of the age spectrum, but I think only the female readers would really enjoy this sweet and tender story.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Stargate universe had promise. Season one was dry and was going nowhere, but season two had more going for it. I wish those short term thinking morons gave it chance than pulling the plug too early.    I knew Syfy started to go downhill when it changed from \\"SciFi\\" to \\"ScyFy\\", started canceling good shows, showing horrendous \\"C\\" flicks, and later added shows like wrestling. I hope another company creates a science-fiction channel and promotes quality shows as well as staying true to fans/customers.    SGU was coming into its own, just needed time...

I could not pull away from it. One of the best movies I have ever seen about mountain climbing on a mountain I have always been fascinated with. I highly recommend it.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Created by Joss Whedon (Buffy, Dollhouse), Firefly was a series on FOX that was prematurely cancelled in 2002.  Although 14 episodes of the science fiction adventure were produced, only 11 were aired.  The tale that Whedon had only begun to tell, was not only left hanging, but tossed to the curb like unwanted trash.  If not for Whedon's determination, and the support of a tremendously loyal fan base, Firefly would have gone the way of countless other cancelled shows, appreciated by a few, but soon forgotten and swept into the gutter of TV history.  Thankfully, on the road to obscurity, something truly amazing and wonderful happened, as the series gained a new audience when released on DVD.  Whedon was always determined to finish telling his story, and with the support of Universal Studios, completed a screenplay for the film that would become Serenity.<br /><br />Released in 2005, Serenity is a triumphant return for the crew of the Firefly, and a magnificent achievement on almost all levels.  The film reunites the entire principal cast from the series, and takes quantum leaps forward in the scope of the story, the level of action, and the quality of the special effects.  Within the limits of a feature film, Whedon addresses most of the questions that were left hanging in the TV series.  The movie retains much of the same spirit, but has a darker more deadly serious tone.  Despite budgetary and time constraints, all the critical elements are raised to completely new levels.<br /><br />The focus of the TV series was mostly on the day to day adventures of the crew attempting find jobs and eek out a living.  Serenity however, is mostly about the Alliance's quest to recapture the mysterious River Tam (Summer Glau).  Once a passenger on the spaceship Serenity, the waifish River's importance is tremendously elevated, and her role expanded to include some impressive fight scenes.  Her brother Simon (Sean Maher) also has a larger role, as the crew of Serenity is basically at war with the Alliance, who have sent The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), to lead the attempt to recover River.  Veterans of the Unification War, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres) return to a wartime mode, and put their fighting skills to use.  Fillion also has several extended fight sequences.  Pilot Hoban `Wash' Washburne (Alan Tudyk) shines in the battle sequences in space.  Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) remains a guy you can mostly count on in a fight, while ship's mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite) is still a wiz with gadgets and a spunky fighter.  Unfortunately many scenes between Reynolds and Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin) ended up being cut.  Shepherd Book's (Ron Glass) appearance is brief, but very touching.<br /><br />The backstory of the mysterious Reavers is revealed, when the Serenity arrives at the ghost planet Miranda.  The Reavers play a key role in the climactic finish that ends with a final battle at the headquarters of Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz).  After the Serenity crash lands, the crew prepares for a battle to the death with the Reavers.  The gentlemanly and overly polite Operative, has proven to be a ruthless persecutor, killing anyone that has ever been a friend to the Serenity.  The final act is a montage of mayhem that begins with a battle in space, then features the crew battling the zombie-like Reavers, and sustaining major injuries.  Down below in the generator room, Mal is tangling with The Operative, and manages to leave him speechless.  With most everyone injured, River engages the enemy alone, in a bloody ballet of death.<br /><br />The special effects heavy Serenity, looks absolutely fabulous on Blu-ray.  The special features are prodigious, with several exclusive to the 2008 Blu-ray.  Joss Whedon's presence is extensive, as he provides a solo commentary, and one with members of the cast recorded in 2007, that can also be viewed as inserted video onscreen.  Whedon discusses why the deleted scenes were cut, as well as many of the other decisions he made regarding the plot, and why not all the characters survive.<br />With Whedon's focus clearly on telling a story galactic in scope, certain sacrifices had to be made, and Serenity is mostly a tale of war, with scant time for romance.  While the film may not totally satisfy the desires of all hardcore fans, it does a very good job of covering most of the high points, and winding up most of the loose ends, as Whedon was not counting on doing another sequel.  As over five years have passed, it seems that he made a wise choice.  Predictably, the cast are all fabulous, particularly Nathan Fillion (Castle) and Summer Glau (Terminator: The Sara Connor Chronicles).  Serenity is a straight ahead action/adventure where the nuances included for the fans, still allow for it to be enjoyed by those who have never seen Firefly.  It's science fiction that is done right, not dumbed down for the masses.ny of the other decisions he made regarding the plot, and why not all the characters survive.

B0042816YK|1.0|I notified this company within the time frame they failed to responed and now I stuck with a movie that does not work. I bought this film for my mom. I should of went to target and just bought the film. Now the company wants to say I never contacted them or within the amount time. Defected material is defected material. I order alot from this website and so do alot of people I know. I would rather pay full price or go to a store then purchase from people who sell defective materials.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this app because I have it on my iPad and it is a ton of fun.  By the time you've beaten the entire game they usually add new levels (every 3 or 4 months) which gives oyu even more time killing game play.  A definite \\"to be purchased\\" app.
B0041EVYVK|4.0|A friend told me about this artist and now it is my new favorite.  I'm an audiophile and enjoy listening to well recorded cd's and SACD's.  This one is recorded above average.

B004XWLN20|4.0|First let me say, this is an awesome show and I love the shows version of Lex Luthor. I have been watching since it began, when I was 17 years old. and here I am at age 27, just watched the finale on Friday, It wasn't the greatest it could have been but I am still happy with it :) still sad to see it go. You become attached, I know its weird because it is a show but it is like a pet, its always sad losing something you've became attached to. Despite some of the shows misses, it had a lot of great hits and brought some iconic characters to life in live action for the first and maybe only time any of these comic characters will. Characters like: Booster Gold, Hawk Man, Aquaman and more. Anyway the collection looks amazing but sadly they were unable to bring the set to Blu Ray, they tried but it was going to be to expensive to redo the special effects in the earlier of the season. It burns a lot since I already own season 7-9 on Blu Ray and want the rest, waiting for the release but now it won't happen. With that said I may sell my Blu Ray's in Mint and take advantage of the deal with iTunes. Currently they have 50% off the entire series and you don't have to wait to the Fall to see them and they are giving the season premiere of each of the 10 seasons away for FREE and it is in HD. I included Links to the article on no blu ray release and the free episodes on iTunes     bit.ly/nosvbluray  bit.ly/kK3uIm
B000CCBCAS|5.0|On my only trip to England, in 1994, this movie was played on the way over on the British Airways flight.  I found it funny then -- or, more to the point, witty -- and I love it still, 17 years later.  Hugh Grant is at his best here -- urbane, hapless, smart and comical all at once.  The funeral sequence I've used repeatedly in my college English literature class to illustrate the intense effect the reading of a \\"death poem\\" can have, as the deceased man's closest friend reads W. H. Auden's \\"Stop all the Clocks\\".  (Auden captures the essence of loss without wallowing in morbid, lugubrious, maudlin language; I've never seen a more moving funeral service.)   Andie McDowell is charming, and the additon of Rowan Martin (\\"Mr. Bean\\") as a novice, bungling clergyman, was an hysterically funny touch.  I highly recommend this movie, even to someone (mostly men, I imagine) who find romantic comedy unappealing.  Believe me, this is not your average \\"chick flick\\", guys.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|The first two tracks that caught my ear were \\"Sail\\" and \\"Guilty, Filthy Soul.\\" Now, I've listened to the whole CD five or six times, and I love every track. I think this will make my \\"All-time Top Five\\" list. They have a unique sound but plenty of variety from track to track. What I like: Syncopated rhythms, catchy hooks, and fun lyrics. I would call them alt-rock; they have a sound that mixes straight-on rock with hints of punk/new wave, hard rock, and pop.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|Thank you all for a great story and a wonderful decade.  Anxious to see all cast members go on to many wonderful projects.  Tom, thank you for your heart and dedication.  I can't imagine what it took from you personally to be so dedicated.  My favorite episodes are always the ones you directed. I am a fan of every actor on the set (O'Toole, Schneider, Mack, Harley, Durance, Rosenbaum, Kreuk, Glover, Freeman, Ashmoor, Ackles and all the rest) - you were marvelously cast and remarkable in your excellence each and every episode.  It's not easy to be in close up all the time.  To the story tellers, the actors, the extras, the special effects team, producers and directors - thank you for the family time, the hope, the inspiration.  It's never too late for a hero.
0061719544|5.0|I've only been a fan of Craig Ferguson's Late Late Show in recent months. Part of what makes it so enjoyable for me is he doesn't feel like a polished show biz guy putting on a performance. It feels like a lot of what we're seeing is pure, raw Craig Ferguson, just talking in front of a camera.    After reading his autobiography, I feel that way even more so. He tells his story with the same wit and frankness he gives us on camera every night.    While his years as an alcoholic are very much an important part of his life, this is the sort of addict's biography that I appreciate: he doesn't use his alcoholism as an excuse or a plea for pity. Nor does he revel in its sordid details. He's very matter-of-fact about the whole thing, regretting that it happened and recognizing that it's nothing to be proud of, but also acknowledging that it did happen, and is a part of who he is.    It's a quick, breezy read that gives me some insight into a personality that I enjoy watching.
0670022411|2.0|I remember how devastated I was when my first real girlfriend broke up with me in 2003. I couldn't eat, sleep, or focus on anything substantive.  All I could do was think about her. I thought about where she was, who she was with, and hoped to God that she was thinking about me; and wondering if time apart had made her reconsider her decision.  I held out hope that she would come to her senses and return to me. But she never did. She was pretty sure of her decision. Eventually, I was able to get over the painful rejection and move on.<br /><br />Eight years have passed and I realize that she made the right decision for the both of us.  In hindsight, I realize that she was not a very nice individual, and I would have been very unhappy if we were still together. So I am thankful.<br /><br />The reason why I'm starting of this review with a personal story is that 'A Discovery of Witches' reminds me of what I went through personally.  The protagonist, Diana Bishop, is a smart and hardworking professor of history at Oxford University.  She has multiple college degrees, has written books, and is  blessed with the supernatural powers of witch craft.  This woman has a lot going for her. Such a character has the potential to be a effective heroine in a novel. Sadly, she is not. In fact, she is an adult Bella Swan; an emo chick who pines over a beautiful male vampire named Matthew Claremont.<br /><br />The book had a lot of potential. Mixing history with themes of the supernatural is an intriguing premise. However, the author devotes a substantial amount of time on the unnecessary. There are entire paragraphs that detail Diana's choice of outfit; and Diana's obsession over Matthew is meticulously discussed. The author seems to take joy in writing about the superficial and the mundane. It's gotten to the point where I can only read a few pages a day because I can't stand the fact that I'm reading about nothing in particular.<br /><br />There is so much material in this novel that should not have been included; and there is so much material that the novel needed that is left out. I was hoping that the novel would enthrall me with adventure, magic, and history. Instead, I'm horrified because I've used my hard earned money to purchase a vanilla Daniel Steele novel, and I want my money back.<br /><br />Do not spend your money on 'A Discovery of Witches'. If you are really curious, wait until the novel is available at your neighborhood library. That way, you can read the novel for free and experience the disappointment without feeling like you've been swindled. If you want to read a book about a woman who loves a vampire, then read 'Twilight'. It is at least honest about its subject matter, and the author writes with a purpose that forces you read the story.uded; and there is so much material that the novel needed that is left out.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|This one is gritty realism at its grittiest.    A 17 year old girl in rural (REALLY rural) Missouri is taking care of her younger brother and sister, and her mother, who is mysteriously incapacitated and never speaks a word.  They get by, barely, by shooting squirrels, accepting handouts, and not much else.    The father, who is absent, must appear for a court date or the family will lose the house and land (a large forest), which he has put up as bond.    The girl goes on a search, against violently antagonistic family and neighbors, for the father.    She finally succeeds, with almost-worse-than-nothing help, and the outcome is cold comfort.    This is a tremendously stark movie.  The acting is great, though dour.  The setting is documentary-real: patched-siding shacks, cannibalized cars and trucks in every yard, scraggy chickens, chained barking dogs.  And the entire society seems powered by meth.  (That's what the father is charged with.)    And yet it is really beautiful and bracing.    Just don't expect to go away humming the music.
0756404738|2.0|For the first half of this book, this is an excellent sequel to the first book:\\"The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)\\".  After that it seems to go into sexual adventures of the hero.  I wish I knew that this was a sexual fantasy book, so I would have clearly avoided it.

B000002JPA|5.0|Of all the music I have ever heard in my life, This is my favorite by far, and this is the album that inspired me to play music. Nothing has ever come close to what is achieved here. Its a perfect storm of musicians at their peak. Kevin Moore's words and melodies are fascinating and intriguing and most importantly are oozing with emotion and depth (something that the band is sorely lacking as of late). At this point Petrucci is young, eager and ready to prove himself and his heart is in it 100 Percent and it really shows here. I am in absolute awe and wonder of his guitar work on this album, its extremely complicated, but never becomes tedious. A quality melody is the priority, first and foremost, not just a million notes just for the sake of playing fast.  Kevin Moore's playing and Petrucci's playing complements each other, rather then \\"Battling\\" each other like Petrucci does with Ruddess.      And my god James Labrie, what an amazing voice, and ever better, it actually fits the music, unlike the Faux death metal direction they have been moving in over the past 2 albums.          It is here when John Myung's heart was still in this band, rather then just playing in Dream Theater as an occupation. The bass lines are unique, intense, and can be clearly heard. He pushed himself as can be seen in the making of the album. And his lyrics on Learning to Live are able to rival Moore's words. I WISH so much that he still wrote lyrics. I am crossing my fingers that he will start writing lyrics once again.      And then there is Mike Portnoy, and much to my delight he is keeping his mouth shut and letting the drums do the talking for him. (when he sung part of Take the Time on the last tour, I almost walked out)(Its like when George Lucas goes back and alters the original Star Wars movies, just leave them the way they are) Portnoy's voice is not suited for singer whatsoever, yet he persists on intruding on the later albums. My respect and appreciation for Dream Theater endedthe moment I heard that god-awful death metal growling. I truly hated them for a while there, and that is the honest truth, but with Portnoy gone I am optimistic for what the future holds.      If I were ever to label an album as perfection this would be it, and there is some real magic here that they may never re-capture. I've seen them live twice, once on the Images tour and then again on the Black Clouds tour. It was like seeing two different bands, and sad really. The band on the Images tours was so full of life and energy. The band I saw on the Black Clouds tours looked bored, tired, and stale. They phoned it in. Well, Regardless of what Dream Theater does in the future, I will always have this album, it can NEVER be taken away from me.
1416550534|5.0|This was a TV book club summer read in the UK which I usually find good for introducing me to new authors. I wasn't disappointed in Kate Morton.<br /><br />The novel jumps backwards in time between the present day and the 1920's. Ordinarily I wouldn't consider a book which would be considered `historical fiction' but I'd heard good things about this and thought I'd give it a try, expecting to get part way through only to abandon. There was no abandoning this, once I started reading I was hooked. The setting is perfectly portrayed and you feel an understanding of what it must have been like to have lived through the 20's.<br /><br />Kate Morton's writing is excellent and she builds a vivid picture. Although you know what the novel is building to, the ending is still a surprise and one where I needed my box of tissues as the bond with Grace, the narrator, had become so strong.

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I found this to be a fantastic read, one of those books that you can't put down and are sad to see the end of. You can feel for all the characters and the atmosphere of the book is that of a 19th Century gothic novel, you can see why Setterfield has been compared to the Bronte's and Austen.<br /><br />This is a novel that you are drawn into, it is so well written that you can see everything happening in front of you. You never know what is going to happen next, there is no predictability in this novel and it is filled with twists and turns to keep you entranced.<br /><br />The only thing more I could have asked for when reading this book was an open fire in an old mansion, with a large high back chair to curl up on and a storm brewing outside.<br /><br />As close to perfect in a book as you're ever going to get, I can't wait for her next one.
1416596585|5.0|I am not an active book reader. But when Matt Cutts blogged about this book, and the way he did, I had to hit the buy button. I actually bought the hard copy as well as the Audible version. Great book. I love it. Anybody who uses Google as part of his job or uses more then 1 Google service could consider buying this one. But for people for whom their lives revolve around Google, its a must buy. It's like a refresher course in Google so to speak...how to evolved, how they think, and I love it.
0140271791|4.0|I am a big Marian Keyes fan and have to say that I really enjoyed this book - the 2nd time round. I did try to read it a number of years ago but just couldn't get into it. Maybe this says more about me than it does about the book.<br /><br />Rachel's Holiday is primarily set in The Cloisters, a rehab facility in Ireland and follows Rachel's journey as she faces up to her addiction to drugs. It cleverly goes backwards and forwards between the present time and the events leading up to Rachel being admitted to The Cloisters. As always there is a love interest or two lurking in the form of Luke, the ex boyfriend who remained in New York after Rachel was shipped back to Ireland and Chris, who is also a resident in The Cloisters.<br /><br />For anyone who has read other Marian Keyes books, Rachel is the middle of the Walsh children who have featured in other of her novels and there are plenty of laughs provided by characters who you'll have met before.<br /><br />Although Marian Keyes says this book is not autobiographical, she has obviously drawn on her experience in rehab facilities and managed to write about a serious subject in a humorous and entertaining manner.<br /><br />If I'd enjoyed it as much the first time I read it as I did the 2nd then I would have given this 5 stars.
0618918248|5.0|Never before had I felt such mixed emotions as have been triggered by this essential piece of literature.  As a child of loving Catholic parents and a small-town Christian Tradition, this book spoke directly to the core inner conflicts I have repressed since elementary school.  Although it took a \\"leap of faith\\" to even consider touching a book like this, I was sure that no one book could ever change my mind on God & Religion unless it were absolutely true, plain, & simple.  It was.
1400032717|5.0|This was originally written as a children's book but has subsequently been picked up by adults, almost definitely due to its subject matter. The narrator of this novel is 15 year old Christopher Boone who suffers from Aspergers Syndrome, a form of autism. You can't help but love this child and want the best for him. Many reviewers have been able to relate this book to their own children and problems they may have - I can't do this, I read it for it being a good book and I enjoyed it for it being excellently written with an ability to tug on your heart strings without being sentimental.<br /><br />I will be honest, the plot isn't great but the characters more than make up for this. I do not know how accurately it portrays the mind of someone with Aspergers but I would like to think it is pretty close to the truth.<br /><br />I think Mark Haddon has done a wonderful job in managing to create a book that not only is not condescending and difficult to read but is remarkably engaging, warm and funny.

As always there is a love interest or two lurking in the form of Luke, the ex boyfriend who remained in New York after Rachel was shipped back to Ireland and Chris, who is also a resident in The Cloisters.<br /><br />For anyone who has read other Marian Keyes books, Rachel is the middle of the Walsh children who have featured in other of her novels and there are plenty of laughs provided by characters who you'll have met before.<br /><br />Although Marian Keyes says this book is not autobiographical, she has obviously drawn on her experience in rehab facilities and managed to write about a serious subject in a humorous and entertaining manner.<br /><br />If I'd enjoyed it as much the first time I read it as I did the 2nd then I would have given this 5 stars.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|I'm usually not into pool games but this one had me entertained for a very long time.  Best of all, it isn't just the one type of pool like you get in every pool game I've ever tried.  There are all sorts of games like snooker and crokinole.  It took second to figure out how to play (aiming and putting power and english on the ball) and kept me happy for a while.  I don't think I would have paid its regular price ($3) as I got this on the day it was free, but if you like pool games then I doubt there is something better than this available.
0743454537|5.0|This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I read and I was very impressed with it, I've read a few of her others since and none of them have lived up to this, although I would give many of them 4*'s.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is very good at taking a very touchy subject and turning it on it's head, this book looks at designer babies, Anna is a teenager who is suing her parents for the right to her body. She was a designer baby who has been used to try to help cure her sisters leukaemia and now she wants her body back.<br /><br />The book is very cleverly written with each chapter coming from a different persons viewpoint, this could have been very confusing but Jodi Picoult handles it very well so you are never in doubt as to who is speaking. She also brilliantly captures the feelings and emotions of each of the people so that the book does not seem to be biased in any way.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to friends and family but they are always nervous about the subject matter but really shouldn't be. Yes, it's an emotive issue but Jodi Picoult allows you to see all sides of the argument.<br /><br />One piece of advice I would give about this book is don't read the end in a public area, it's easy to carry a book with you everywhere when you get hooked and you will get hooked to this book. Reading this in public will embarrass you as the twist in the end left me almost hysterical, to the point that I can feel myself welling up again just thinking about it now. One to be enjoyed curled up on the sofa on a Sunday afternoon.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I find these headphones great since I was looking for something light and these ones are really very light. Sound is better than most headphones but not as good as in-ear ones. But good product for a very good price I must say. After all, they are SONY and I like Sony for the quality of their products...

B004OFWLO0|5.0|I first bought vol. 2 of \\"King of the Delta Blues Singers\\" in 1985 then vol. 1 a few weeks after.  In 1990 I bought the \\"Complete Recordings\\" box set.  Now in 2011 we have the \\"The Centennial Collection\\".  I will not review the music of Robert Johnson other than to say it is Blues at its very best.    For those who own the 1990 \\"Complete Recordings\\" I say replace it with this set!  The sound of this set is so startling it was, for me, like hearing the music for the first time.  There was a subtlety and softness to Johnson's vioce I had never heard before.  One could hear him trailing his singing off at the end of a verse.  His guitar playing too is beautifully clear on this set, So dynamic and powerful.    Again, get it!

B000HL09MG|2.0|A boring movie with disturbing themes, nonsensical elements, and plenty of female nudity. As open-minded as I am, I could not find any redeeming qualities in this film...saw no purpose for it. And to be fair, as much as people have complained about the show of \\"sex\\" and nudity, I didn't care for the obvious lack of male nudity...if they're going to go so far with females, at least make it balanced (especially in the strange and dorky orgy scene). And where's Tom Cruise's bare *ss? You get to see plenty of Nicole Kidman! It's all just a bunch of krraaap! Just my two cents.
B004UQPM4E|4.0|I know many prefer the newer super hero movies. But for me along with many others in their 30s, 40s and 50s the superman movies are some of the most memorable superhero cinema experiences. I have seen every one of these movies many times I still enjoy them. The bonus features are awesome there has never been a more comprehensive superman movie experience. The only reason it got 4 stars is because about 80 percent of the bonus content in this package is already in the superman ultimate collectors edition from 2006. But as some of my favorite movies of all time its worth purchasing again in blu ray.
B004RC8NUQ|1.0|The story line of this movie was terrible.I think they thought by saying the word Penis like a million times it would be funny.  Wondering if Kutcher even went to acting school or he just got in the business on Demi Moores shirtail. Could not wait for this movie to end.  Now Kutcher is going to ruin \\"Two in a half Men series\\" will stop buying and watching this series.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I enjoyed The Killing Floor. The main character--Jack Reacher--is a military police officer rifted after spending most of his life serving his country. He copes by hitting the road and ends up in a small Georgia town near Atlanta. He is falsely accused of murder and ends up attempting to solve the case, uncovering a nefarious enterprise run by a sadistic man and his son that involves a whole town. Reacher's motivation for being co-opted to solve the case are 1) his affection for a sexy deputy and 2) a coincidence that is so impossible that it almost made me stop reading the book altogether...you'll find out what it is if you read the book.<br /><br />The book is a fun mystery to follow for the most part and the author's writing is, at times, poetic without being sappy. If you can suspend you disbelief on a couple of key elements of the plot, you will enjoy this fast-paced read. If you are apt to question far-fetched plot twists, I'd pass on this book.
B003XWEQ1G|1.0|For every one thing that this movie gets right (no, the middle ages wasn't neat like Disneyland...) it gets something else wrong (the entire beach scene...medieval LSTs, really!?).  Russell Crowe has fallen for his own publicity, and can't find a role equal to his own magnificence...Excesses will abound, and if he lives long enough he may get back to doing an excellent job on good roles.  In the meantime, expect roles with realities stretched to suit his inflated ego.      Just about any other version is superior...I'd even watch \\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\\" before subjecting myself to this dog again...
B00006I53S|4.0|I've had this lens for about 3 months now, and have taken 3000-3500 photos with it, mainly outside shots.  Most of the photos were shots of head stones in various cemetery's for my wife's volunteer genealogy work (Google findagrave if you are interested in finding out more).  Taking pictures of head stones sounds easy (they don't move very much ;)) but the composition of the various materials, their reflective properties and the aging of the stone's surface all combine to keep it interesting. In addition, many of the older cemetery's are in sad shape, with small trees and brush growing up around the stones. Several shots may be required for a given stone: shot of the stone itself, up-close shots of the text so my wife can transcribe the information later and associated nearby stones that might share the same relationship. When I first started taking cemetery shots, I was using a Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM, which produced nice clear photos, but being a prime lens I was constantly moving to and fro acting as the telephoto component.  This was do-able for awhile, but after a few hundred shots with my legs acting as the telephoto, I started using the Canon EF 28-135mm f3.5-5.6 IS USM lens instead. I can shot a 5' tall stone and be within 6.5' of it, I could never do that with my 50mm lens.  That, and the ability of the telephoto to get a shot of a stone buried in some thorny brambles has made this lens indispensable when doing this type of work. In summary I enjoy using this lens, and it is quickly becoming my most used all purpose lens.  The lens does tend to extend out when carrying it around on your camera, and some people have mentioned the weight of the lens, neither of these are a concern with me, and I have walk for hours carrying my Canon T2i with this lens attached.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|This double romance starts with Blu, the macaw, and his human partner Linda - a cute but retiring bookstore owner. It turns out that Blue is the last male of his species, and a South American ornithologist knows of a female. They get together, of course, then get chained together by animal smugglers aiming to convert our heroes into a pile of cash. They escape, still chained, the chase is on.<br /><br />Note that I didn't say \\"take flight.\\" Although Jewel, the female, has all the usual skills of a jungle-born bird, Blu's urban lifestyle has left him with the flying ability of a penguin. The story proceed predictably through trials and adventures, good guys and bad guys, and plenty of visual humor, down to the end you pretty much expected all along.<br /><br />But, with a movie like this, the fun is in getting there. The animation, especially things like feathers and the birds' mody motions, meet the best of today's high standards. Scripting works well, too, so parents taking their kids should have a good time, too. Nothing will ever replace [[ASIN:B00005KARK Dumbo]] in the learning to fly genre, but this makes an honorable companion to that classic.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0812971825|5.0|Reading Elizabeth Strout's \\"Abide with Me\\" reminded me how fiction can sometime capture the truth of things better than a factual account, just as a fine painting can sometimes be more truthful than a photograph of the same scene.<br /><br />I heard Strout speak a few years ago at a Bangor Theological Seminary Convocation, and I knew her book was about a congregational minister in rural Maine, but I only just got around to reading it.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The resonances for me to my own life are striking.  I am not Tyler Caskey, her protagonist, but I did begin my ministry in a couple of very small rural Maine towns that bear a notable resemblance to the fictional West Annett.  And I left those congregations to become the chaplain at Bangor Seminary, which is the model for Tyler's alma mater, Brockmorton Theological Seminary (a whimsical reference I am sure to my late former colleague, iconic Bangor New Testament Professor Burton H. Throckmorton.)<br /><br />Like Tyler I married a Massachusetts gal who came up to live with me in the parsonage to much speculation.  There are many differences to be sure:  I started my ministry in the mid 70's and Tyler in the late 50's, but things in small town Maine hadn't changed all that much.<br /><br />Stout deftly describes the \\"wheels within wheels\\" complexity behind the seemingly simple social life of a small Maine town.  The people of West Annett endure the soul-numbing endless winter, and they are unaware of how they have embraced their dearth of possibilities as a virtue.<br /><br />Strout takes her time. You know from the first page that some bad things have happened to Tyler Caskey and the denizens of West Annett, but she is no hurry to tell you what they are.  Her storytelling is like peeling an onion, and that in itself captures the rhythm of these small towns, where nothing ever seems to happen on the surface when it is really as busy as an ant farm just below.<br /><br />Tyler himself is a loveable character, too earnest by half, with his love of Bonhoeffer, his tenderness toward is wounded young daughter, and his quiet faithfulness in his daily round. Strout knows her church, and she knows something of the grandeur and misery of the ministry, as the minister can move in a minute from reading the Cost of Discipleship to hearing tawdry local gossip or the sordid confession of a soured marriage.  Her cast of characters will bring a smile to many a rural parson:  the hostile husband reading the paper in the car in the church parking lot, the loyalist who routinely phones Tyler to warn him what's up,  several variants of antagonists, and the married woman with a crush on the minister as well as a bone to pick.<br /><br />Strout observes her characters with clear eyes, and her depictions at times just miss being cruel. If you care for these flawed people at all it is because of something like grace, since they are not \\"good\\" people in the way that real people  generally are not.  Yet in the end, in keeping with its subject matter, this is a story of redemption.  Strout doesn't clean up the messiness of life, but she knows that the holy rhythm that runs from Good Friday to Easter isn't confined to ancient Jerusalem.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away.  Read Abide with Me.  It's the kind of book that when you finish the last page and close the cover you are already missing the characters.<br /><br />[...]
B000FC10MU|1.0|I saw that this book was an award winner and gave it a try.  It was terrible.  The premise was stupid and never made any sense.  Characters were lame.  Awful!
031261246X|5.0|I have worked in the IT field all my life.  I can say, without exception, this is very thought provoking, disturbing to \\"connect the dots\\", and accurate technically.  Although me suggesting technical accuracy is kind of like a first grader telling a college professor that their solution looks good (me being the first grader).  We always think of virus' as very specific in nature to target a specific operating system and/or software application so to start in on this book and quickly realize this virus infects a very diverse amount of equipment is very interesting.  I get the strong feeling that Mark wrote this book as a venue to openly explain very tangible possibilities, regarding the public and private efforts on both perspectives (hackers and cybercrime institutions) while being able to firmly stand behind the veil that he wrote a science fiction not a non-fiction.  He is putting the world on notice, plain and simple.  This really isn't science fiction, more like a futurist perspective salted with characters to make the read easier to chew on.  Many times in the book Mark brings \\"facts and statistics\\" forward which immediately made me stop reading for a sec, stare at the wall and mutter \\"holy s...., not good\\".  From this perspective I strongly recommend you understand and/or research Mark's career.  He pulled the pants down on both Sony and Symantec for embedding root kits in their software/hardware.  This is mentioned in the book with no reference to himself as this is science fiction .. . .right?  So, you get the idea real fast, that this scenario is not fabricated like most \\"save the planet\\" jokes of sci-fi are.  The book is even more riveting when you know this isn't just another author having done homework on the topic.  In Wikipedia under career the last sentence reads, \\"He is widely regarded as a Windows expert.\\"  Negative; he is widely regarded as the person experts turn to when they are at a loss.  Don't know what that label is, but that about sums it up.  One final note.  If you're not in the computer world or think this book is above your capability to understand, don't let that hold you up.  The 'meat' of the book is based around the situations and consequence of a computer driven world and he does a great job keeping you engaged and thinking how things could possibly get worse and hopefully get better.  You don't need to have any amazing computer sk1llz to engage.      Just start the damn thing on a 'Friday' so you don't spend all Tuesday night reading and have to go to work the next day; like I did!
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I watched this after seeing news/reviews about it on io9.com. A lot of comparisons are made between Cloverfield and it, but I feel that it is rather quite different movie. There are moments of action and it is far from dull, but it is really not deserving of classifications as \\"thriller\\" or \\"horror\\" of which I've seen. That's not to say I didn't thoroughly enjoy it. It has a really great documentary feel and is really interesting look to the culture and folklore of the area. It really feels fresh, unlike a lot of the crap Hollywood is pumping out these days. I highly recommend it, and in fact, I will be watching it again today.
0439796644|4.0|War Horse is a well told story, with decent character development.  As an adult I enjoyed reading the novel, but it's better suited to readers in their middle teens.
0307454541|2.0|This is a hard-to-read novel (a rare thing for me since in many cases I'll go to the end of a book, just to see how the author gets himself out of the pickle).<br />However, it is a huge success in Europe, which explains the reason so many European movies never made it across the Atlantic<br />It is dense and endlessly tedious, and by one third of the pages you are resisting the urge to put it down for good. But one doesn't give up just because one fails to understand the supposed brilliance of a writer. At this point, you begin to doubt your own intellectual depth or lack of it; after all, every other person and critics said it is brilliant.<br />That is, until someone else confides in you and says, \\"I couldn't finish it.\\" Then you feel vindicated, but challenged. You go home, pick it up again, and read an additional one third. Finally with your head held high, you put it back down, go to bed, and turn the light off.<br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a bloody, dark tale of crimes and corruption that requires attention to what you are reading; otherwise you will find it necessary to go back and reread because you are lost. (Could this be due to the translation?) As is true in many of these acclaimed blockbuster works, it take courage to say, \\"I couldn't finish it.\\"<br /><br />E.C. Brierfield
0525423273|4.0|Okay, first, let me address something that has been bugging me about reviews for this book: Stephanie Perkin's debut novel is not a chick lit. I repeat, it is not chick lit. It's a romance. There is a difference. Chick lit is basically about women (typically in their 20s, professional, and single) and how they relate to themselves, other women, and men. Romance may be a part of the story but isn't necessary. A romance novel, on the other hand, is centered around a romance [obviously]. Chick lit books focus mainly on how the female protag changes and the broader conflict of her vs. the world, as opposed to her vs. a man, like a romance. Therefore, Anna and the French Kiss is a romance.    Whew! Now that that's over...    I really, really, really wanted to love this book. I enjoy a good contemporary every once in a while. I had seen so many outstanding reviews that I thought it would be impossible for me not to love it. But honestly, it didn't wow me. *ignoring audible gasps from readers*    I've got to tell you, Anna's griping about her dad was obnoxious. She is so terribly embarrassed of him and for no honestly good reason. Heaven forbid he make money. Heaven forbid he try to better her life by sending her to a good school. What was she so angry about? I could understand missing your family and being miffed that your father wanted to take you away from your friends and school senior year of high school, but I think mostly everyone I've ever met would have jumped at the chance to live in Paris.    Aside from Anna's annoying tendency to be slightly bratty, I enjoyed her character. I also really liked St. Clair and all the other friends she meets. They were well-developed, and I loved their interactions. I also liked that St. Clair wasn't tall, dark, and handsome. He was an average bloke (hehe) and had flaws: he bit his fingernails constantly, he was really short, and he was terrified of heights. That all made him interestings, so props to Perkins for that!    I also liked how the relationship was slow and progressed throughout the story. There was no love-at-first-sight. Sure, there was attraction, but that's legit. You can be attracted to someone the second you meet them, but odds are, you don't love them. (Take notes, Shakespeare!) This was also a pretty squeaky clean romance. Sure, Anna thinks about sex. (All teens do.) But she states outright that she's not ready for it, and she even admits to being a virgin. I liked that. She knew who she was and didn't feel the pressure to conform. Plus, I'm a sucker for a romance that doesn't actually happen until the end (reminds me of Jane Austen), so I really liked that about this book, as well.    Speaking of the end, herein lies my chief complaint. And honestly, I think this all boils down to personal preference. I have a hard time with happy endings. If someone doesn't die, the book just doesn't feel complete. Anna and the French Kiss is sugary sweet - a little too much so for me. Everything is tied up pretty with a bow on top at the end, and I wanted some gut-wrenching pain that makes you put the book down and want to cry your eyes out but that you know had to end that way because it was just right. This could even be a happy ending book, but there needed to be some suffering along the way.    I was told once that all great literature has one overarching theme: human suffering. That was what was lacking in Anna for me: good old fashion pain.    Everything is cute and adorable, but that's not really my cup of tea...unless it's a Sophie Kinsella or Lauren Willig novel, in which case I don't care that it's corny happy because I'm laughing so hard I'm snorting. Maybe that's what I was missing in Anna: humor. I didn't get any. Sure, it was cute...but that was it. Fluff. There's certainly nothing wrong with fluff, but I guess I just wanted there to be more sustenance.    I picked out exactly where I would have liked the book to end: page 347, after Anna has almost \\"ruined\\" her whole life. She's at the theater:    \\"And I realize...it's okay. It's okay if St. Clair and I never become more than friends. His friendship alone has strengthened me in a way that no one else's ever has. He swept me from my room and showed me independence. In other words, he was exactly what I needed.\\"    And...end book. There would have been such a strong message here, that even though life doesn't always turn out the way we want it to, it's for the best, that the people we meet like St. Clair might not end up being our besties or our boyfriends but they change who we are, and we're better people for it. ...not \\"and they lived happily ever after.\\"
1594202842|4.0|Oof, I'm not sure how to put my opinion on this book into words! I basically agreed with many others' assessment: I found her theory had merit, but couldn't support her methods. I feel like some of the people who hate her and the book didn't pick up on the tongue-in-cheek writing (that is, that a lot of her supposedly extreme statements/stories were said with some amount of seriousness but also with an eye to how ridiculous they sound -- \\"dreams for Coco\\" comes to mind), or they only read the Wall Street Journal article with the unfortunate title. I came out of it feeling that she truly did what she thought was best for her kids, and, bravely, when she figured out that what she was doing WASN'T best for one of her kids - it was in fact harmful - she changed.    This book definitely hits home for a lot of people -- nothing is more personal than how you raise your kids -- and I think the fact that I'm not a parent made this an easier and more enjoyable read for me than it would if I were raising children myself.
B002M87W1I|5.0|Network may have been a satire in 1976, but, today, 41 years later, in 2017, that satire is all too real. Today with our reality TV and our present administration, this film is all too prescient. Instead of rebelling against the authority of Television and it's owners, we are rebelling against authoritarian and the administration.<br /><br />Peter Finch plays Howard Beale, a television anchor, grown old and out of tune. He is fired from his news station, UBS. His boss, Max, played by William Holden, an old friend and boss, gives him the news and they go out drinking. The next night Beale gives an impassioned plea for the TV audience to take charge of their.  This strikes a chord and Howard Beale becomes the phrophet of the ages. Unfortunately, others at the TV station have ideas of their own. Life spirals out of control.<br /><br />Faye Dunaway, who plays Diane Christenson, is a purveyor if ratings and programs that bring in big money. The people she works for and with are the same, the might dollar, lack if empathy, job focus is their life. The only real adult is Max, and he was fired. He has a life and family which is interrupted, but he has hope. There are many great performances. Peter Finch died of heart failure and won an Academy Award posthumously.  This is a film that registers with anyone over 50. Fir us it was satire, now it is reality.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 02-19-17
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I had this product for 6 weeks and one day it just stopped working.  I am so disappointed because when it worked, it worked just exactly like it was advertised.  But a product that cost over $30 should NOT stop working less than two months after purchase.  Furthermore, since it is beyond the \\"return date\\" of 30 days, I can't return it.  I would like to replace it.
0670022411|2.0|There was some amazing storytelling in this book.  However, the conflict between protagonist and antagonist is not resolved and worse, postponed to some future book.  It irks me to read a 600 page tome only to find [SPOILER ALERT] in the last 50 pages new characters, time travel and a 'to be continued' theme is introduced.  EPIC FAIL!
0786715103|5.0|This is a must-read! As many reviewers have already said, it is an incredible book. This is a book that he wants his children and grandchildren to read so they'll know what he did and did not do in the genocide (it's in the Shake Hands with the Devil Documentary). To go straight to the point, it took me a long time to read, but it was worth it. It's a very detailed book about the Rwandan genocide and I think he does a wonderful job in explaining what happened. I found the book to be really informative. He wants us to be the change that we want to see, and this is very inspiring.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|this was worth the rental. pretty cool. one thing that would make it better though is if the trolls were also done with some of the stuff Ray Harryhausen used to do. so some shots would be with the computer fancy pants stuff and other shots with the stop animation mixed in.
0865479186|5.0|Even though the title indicates a generic topic \\"Bad Science\\", be aware this book deals almost exclusively with medical topics.  It's not the criticisms aren't valid for other areas because they are, but this is not a generalist book.    Having got that out of the way, this book is simply excellent.  It's entertaining and informative.  The author's target audience is a generally intelligent layman, and with that target audience he has done a masterful job.  It should be required reading for everyone who is interested in medicine, nutrition, and their health.  It does not contain advanced material, but that is not its purpose and so it shouldn't be criticized for that.  You can't be all things to all people or you will be nothing to anyone.    The author's style is a little bit confrontational, but he does it with such wit it works perfectly.  He does a very effective job of skewering the purveyors of pseudo-science and their co-conspirators in the credulous media.  Here is the author's own description of his book in the preface:    \\"It's easy to laugh at quacks - but this book is not about easy targets or individuals.  It follows a natural crescendo, from the foolishness of quacks, via the credence they are given in the mainstream media, through the tricks of the fifty-five-billion-dollar food supplements industry, the evils of the six-hundred-billion-dollar pharmaceuticals industry, the tragedy of science reporting, and on to cases where people have wound up in prison, derided, or dead, simply through the poor understanding of statistics and evidence that pervades our society.\\"    Very highly recommended.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|I'm a huge superman fan always have been and always will be. The Smalliville series was just amazing. There were definitely certain seasons that weren't as good as others but overall it was a great show. It sucks that theres not going to be anymore Smallville on tv because I grew up with the show since the start. The finale of the Smallville series was pretty good in my opinion. The last ten minutes of the series was absoultely breathtaking and amazing. It was awesome to see Clark become the man he was destined to be and I really liked that they brought back Lex. I wish maybe they could have brought back Lana but she was really not that big a part of the Superman comics anyway. I know this is the end of the Smallville series but I just want to say that this is my favorite show of all time and I was always very excited to watch the next episode and see what they were going to do this iconic character and show. I wish success for not only the actors but anybody that contributed in anyway to the series, they put together a fantastic product that fans will not soon forget!
1935251740|4.0|This is a good book and good read...but it's not based on science. Not that there is anything wrong with that. What is wrong is that it's based on misinterpretation of science. At best, it's based on metaphysics. This is a good example of how quantum physics and other sciences can be misinterpreted to reach silly conclusions.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|The DVD is just great and these songs are where she stands out for the most part, ie her voice is crystal clear.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Wow! A fast reading book that leaves you speechless and makes you ask \\"why?\\" I loved it and will be thinking of this book for years to come.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|When the son of Tron aka Tron Legacy came out, I wanted to see the original.  As most will agree, the originals of most movies are usually better.  As I viewed the original Tron, aka Tron Classic, I was happy to revisit OLLLLLDDD memories.  Gosh, was Jeff Bridges ever really that young.  What fun.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  I am happy to be the owner of the DVD.      Remember VHS tapes?      May the force be with you.        [[ASIN:B004KPLVW2 Tron: The Original Classic (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]
B001TH16DI|4.0|These blu-ray discs offer a really great way to enjoy the first six Star Trek films. The picture is beautiful and the sound is exceptional. There are many bonus features about the making of the films and their history.  However, I would have liked an extended edition of the first film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and later editions of others and wondered why at least some of them were not included in the set.  True, I enjoy seeing movies shown as they were shown the first time in the theater, but if a later version of the film is made, and it is better and sometimes longer, it seems that it should be offered with the most modern technology.  But this set is well worth your money for the vast improvement of picture and sound if you previously owned the VHS tapes and DVD's. You will be very pleased with this new look of these now classic films.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I guess there are some people who don't know how to us the app but it is very self explanitory, to search for videos hit you're menu button, to download keep you're finger on the video then a menu will pop up,  it works wonders
B003UESJH4|5.0|Absolutely love this movie.  I saw it in a theater and just had to have it for my personal video library. I'm sure I will watch it over and over. What a great way to review history.
B0013NBBOW|4.0|Still raw much like a dress rehearsal for big things to come particularly for Hillage and Dave Stewart. The compositions are not as complex and catchy as the later recordings of Hillage as a solo artist and with Gong and Dave Stewart with National Health, Hatfield and his many mind inducing projects. Despite this neophyte like album it is still worthy of having in one's music library particularly if you are collecting every sound of these two great artists.
B00260HH3K|2.0|So where do I start...this is so not the [[ASIN:B002FOQXTQ Dragon Ball]] I knew.  For one, ChiChi was completely neutered.  Her overbearing personality was no where to be seen.  Instead she was this empowered modern chick that displayed a lot of confidence.  Another thing that stood out was Master Roshi and the fact that he dropped Bulma after grabbing her ass.  He wouldn't have done that - he would have groped (and giggled like a school girl) as long as she would let him.      The biggest disappointment was the total lack of confidence that Goku displayed.  That is one of Goku's defining characteristics - nothing gets him down and he's an eternal optimist.  And they made him a cheater!  I could probably go on all night with everything that was just wrong with this movie (they didn't get a single character right), but I don't want to waste any more time on this movie.    Seriously, if you're a fan of the cartoon series, DO NOT WATCH THIS.  You'll just end up disappointed.    Oh yeah, one last thing - WITH were the fights scenes.  Dragon Ball is known to have amazing fights and they were totally missing from the movie.  The only, remotely interesting, skirmish involved a few jocks and Goku never throws a punch.  He does nothing but dodge.
B0034KZE9U|5.0|I just got these to replace my Endeavor Crocs that I have been wearing to work, hospital laboratory, for 4 years.  Every night, I work the evening shift, the floors are wet mopped. I use to walk very slow and careful as the old E. Crocs were SO slippery on the wet floors.  Last night not at all.  I thought they would be better but they were totally non slip.  I was so glad as I carry specimens and must be very quick.  They are firmer then the original Crocs but I quickly became used to them and really appreciated the sure footedness I felt.  No regrets.  We are not allowed to have holes in our shoes hence the Endeavors and now the Bistros.  I got the Navy.?
030746363X|5.0|I have always been thin at 5' 10\\".  By following the advice in Tim's book, I was able to increase my weight from im's 145 lbs to 165 lbs in two months.  My goal is 175 lbs. The number one tip that really help was GOMAD or Gallon of Milk a Day.  I also started using kettlebells in my weight training per suggestions in this book.  This is one of the best self-help books on building a better physique that I have ever read. A++.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this for everything from keeping track of homework assignment deadlines and exam dates to shopping lists. Love the colorcoding! Helps me stay on top of my busy schedule for sure!
B004IQMXD4|4.0|This is not her best album, but it is a good album. Dave Stewart brings some great fresh production ideas to the mix, not to mention that this album sounds fantastic in the sonic sense. Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream) is my top pick on this album.  If you like Stevie Nicks you will most likely enjoy this album, if you are new to her start with Bella Donna or Time Pieces.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I cried, I screamed, and could not put it down. Please don't pass this book up. Someone recommended it to me and I was not sure at first but then I could not wait until the next time I was able to pick up where I left off. You will not be sorry I promise!!
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|the game is fun. It's simple to play, kind of addictive, and relatively clever in the weapon selection. Only problem is that it freezes every time I play it for more than 10 minutes. Would give it a 5 and would gladly pay 99 cents if it didn't crash all the time.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This film puts the lie to \\"clean natural gas.\\" \\"They're taking a beautiful piece of country and turning it into a big trash dump.\\" Who's \\"they\\"? It's not the people who have to live near the wells, breathe the toxic fumes, drink contaminated water, or try to raise crops and animals on contaminated land. Gasland shows how the wealthy few are stealing the lives and livelihoods of the unpowerful many backed by the bought or at least unfeeling politicians. What is wrong with us? I highly recommend this film.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Just caught up with this one. This is a great movie, heaps of action and hot babes, and some of them nude to boot. Just don't take this movie seriously, sit back and enjoy. A word of warning, keep it away from the kids, for me, they see enough violence on TV and in video games, let 'em grow up a bit first. For Mum and Dad, go for it enjoy. Can't wait for the sequels.
B000W4KT64|3.0|I bought this video for my 6-year old granddaughter.  She saw the movie before when I borrowed it from a friend and she absolutely fell in love with it.  We watched it a couple times this weekend and I was disappointed because there were 4 or 5 spots in the movie when the video started \\"blocking\\" out -- I had to skip those scenes and go on to the next.  Granted, I only paid about $5.00 (new) for the movie -- but it was in its original wrapper -- and I don't think it should have been \\"blocking\\" because of it being new.  My son said he has a cleaner, so I am hoping that takes care of the problem.
B003L77GW4|5.0|When you go back and watch it all on DVD you get to see just how amazing Stargate Universe really is! It's a shame how true quality gets cut while OK and mildly entertaining drivel goes on and on and on and on! Im not going to talk about how spectacular SGU is because when you buy it you WILL find out for yourself.<br /><br />Im just saddened by the fact that so many so-called SG fans quit on SGU. Appearently it wasn't low-brow enough for their needs. I guess there wasn't enough stuff blowing up for them to be satisfied. Rediculous. The same thing happened wth \\"Caprica\\"! I went back and watched it from start to finish and it too was increadible. While I watched it, it just hurt because I knew this was it.<br /><br />The quiters and haters have robbed us! Robbed us of great story telling.
B004LL1HM4|2.0|I've been reading the glowing reviews of this latest Fleet Foxes recording and I was very intrigued. I must be the only person in the world who hasn't heard the first album. Helplessness Blues is my introduction to the band and I really wanted to like it. The recording is lush and beautifully produced. The harmony singing and certain instrumental passages can be quite captivating at times. The Cascades is a really pretty, short instrumental piece. Blue Spotted-Tail is wonderful, mostly because of the simplicity of the acoustic guitar and melody line. But the problem for me, despite the clear effort that's gone into this disc, is that it just doesn't hang together very well as an album. Fleet Foxes have assembled a veritable pastiche of sounds that remind one -- too obviously at times -- of Crosby, Stills and Nash, the Beach Boys, even Simon and Garfunkel. There's too much of a grand statement trying too grandly to be made. Also, Robin Pecknold's voice is fine when it is surrounded by others in harmony, but is a bit too keening on its own. Anyway, I guess this isn't exactly my cup of tea, but I appreciate what Fleet Foxes are trying to do. I would encourage folks who are drawn to this type of music to check out the album Wake Up by indie Ottawa band Dry River Caravan. That one's really worth seeking out!
B001IFZL50|5.0|If you havent seen this movie, youre missing out. The special features on this are informative and easy to navigate. I highly recommend it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had the Ear Force X3's ever since they came out, which have been great quality sound and faithful to me for about 3 years. But, it was time for an upgrade, so I bought the Ear Force X41's and so far, they have been amazing. The surround sound (compared to the stereo of the X3's) has been a big difference and sound awesome with the bass boost on. I can hear everyone and every little thing happening around me in beautiful clear sounds when I'm playing Call of duty black ops. Plus, they are lighter and more comfortable than the X3's. I can even hear my game in the headphones when I walk out of the room. They were a sweet investment.     Audio: 10/10 - awesome surround sound, with an awesome bass boost making guns sound awesome.    Comfort: 9/10 - light weight, comfortable around the ears and on the head.
0307712508|5.0|All I can say is WOW! It's an amazing book! I wasn't too sure about what the book was about and if it would hold my interest but within the first couple of chapters I was hooked. I'm not in the medical field but it doesn't matter, it's about the history of where this has brought us in cell research and how it affected this family and the life of black people.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I have been wanting the last Season of \\"24\\" since the Season's ending. Looked for it every where in stores.  First time seeing it since it was made available, I was about to buy but the prices seemed to be so out of pocket, therefore, I waited for the price to come down. While shopping through Amazon.com, I noticed this product nearly half the price in stores.  After reading the rattings I decided to order.  Please know, I was highly pleased at not only the price, time of delivery but also the QUALITY of the product.  After viewing the videos, I give the HIGHEST RATTING EVER. TOTALLY PLEASED! is how I will some it up.
B002PJ4II4|5.0|I initially bought this book for a review I had to do for a class. It turned out to be way more enjoyable that I could have ever imagined. I just love how Woz paints a picture of his experiences so vivid that you almost feel like you could have been there. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the Woz, anyone who wants to learn more about the advent of the personal computer, or for anyone who just enjoys a good story. This book is awesome!
0385732554|3.0|I felt obligated to read The Giver, since I'd heard so much about it from friends who teach middle school English, I'd read about it in a number of scholarly articles about Young Adult literature, and it seems to be rising to the level of a YA classic. It's relatively brief, and it's a very quick read, and it seems almost purposely designed to be taught as a middle school YA novel. The futuristic setting in which everyone exists under a doctrine of Sameness in a socially engineered society and children's future occupations are determined for them at the age of 12 by a council of Elders, along with the absence of real emotions, colors, and memories clearly telegraphs a number of \\"Important Themes\\" that provide very rich fodder for trenchant analysis in middle school literature classrooms. Now, I'm not denying the value of this novel as a staple of 7th and 8th grade literature curricula--if I were still teaching secondary English, I could certainly see myself including this in my school's curriculum. In my opinion, however, the best YA novels are--first and foremost--good novels that will also appeal to young adults (e.g., any of the Harry Potter novels). Genre fiction definitely has its place, but I suspect that most young adults who read this novel read it because it's assigned to them in class and not because it has any kind of intrinsic appeal.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I don't care whether George Lucas includes the butchered \\"special editions\\" or not.  I simply want the versions I knew and loved as a child in the highest quality blu-ray.
B001AQT11M|5.0|There is nothing like watching the Disney classic Snow White.  I didn't think my grandchildren, both boys, would like it because of the love story, but they both sat with me and watched the only movie.  They didn't like the voice of Snow White, felt it too high pitched, but for the most part, they liked the movie.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|I own every album Dylan has released except for a few of his less highly-regarded live ones such as \\"Dylan and The Dead.\\" This is easily in his top ten if not top five, though the die-hard fossilized hippie types may dismiss it (as they tend to do with anything else he did after 1969 except Blood On the Tracks.)<br /><br />His voice is rough but expressive, and all of the songs strike me as either highly entertaining or downright great. The lyrics lack the surrealism of the earlier \\"greats\\" such as Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61, but have a more incisive realism, full of pithy observations, humorous asides, and highly evocative, colorful phraseology.<br /><br />The whole feel of the album is very \\"southern,\\" seeming to speak in voices of old plantation hands, washed-up riverboat gamblers, retired sharecroppers, former Confederate soldiers, small-town romantics, gator-swamp rats, and the like. None too overtly, though - it's a more subtle kind of \\"feel\\" to the atmosphere than anything identifiably obvious. Even the instruments strike me as \\"southern sounding,\\" though I can't describe why. It all tends to sound like an old folk-philosopher sitting on his front porch at sunset, dispensing rough gems of worldly wisdom and telling the occasional corny joke. Only the first song really avoids this feel, being a quick-paced and more surreal commentary on some ambiguous pair of losers referred to as Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.<br /><br />Also, the album is overall quite upbeat, unlike \\"Time Out of Mind.\\" I feel that it is the best of his last five albums, though Time Out of Mind is close and Modern Times isn't bad either.
B000BNX3B4|4.0|I cannot personally relate to the divorce situation as I've been married to the same woman since I was a teenager; I can try and imagine what it would be like to suddenly find one single and being urged to rejoin the dating scene. It seems as if that could feel very awkward.<br /><br />Both Sarah, played by Diane Lane, and Jake, played by John Cusack find themselves unwillingly thrust into that scene; the movie is the story of how they try and deal with this new reality. Sarah is supported by a strong family with efforts to help spearheaded by her two sisters and Jake has a friend who wants to help him so there is plenty of intrigue and maneuvering as the well-intentioned do what they think will help the most.<br /><br />The story is expanded when Sarah's father, Bill, played by Christopher Plummer, who has been happily married until the death of his wife, also finds himself on the dating scene looking for companionship.<br /><br />The movie has nice scenery, good sound, and a first class supporting cast. On balance it is an enjoyable evening's entertainment.
B003UESJ9M|1.0|I was very dissapointed with this movie. It has very few good songs, but worst of all, the plot is empty and extremely boring.  Paltrow looks old and has lost her former beauty and looks. Don't buy it !!!
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This was my first Lisa Gardner book but believe me it won't be the last.  I loved the way it was written.  It hooked me right from the beginning.  I couldn't stop reading this because from page to page I was not sure whether Bobby Dodge was a good guy or a bad guy.  The ending was full of excitement too.  Many twists and turns.  Full of suspense the whole book.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I bought this Season 4 of Lost because I hadn't seen any of it on television.  If I hadn't started watching Lost, I wouldn't have bought it.
B000002UVX|3.0|Jimi has some fantastic playing on this cd, especially on Machine Gun, Power to Love, and Message to Love, but Buddy Miles really has a annoying drumming style and voice. He ruins  Who Knows with his horrible vocal solo and tries to ruin all of the other Hendrix tunes. I also feel Buddy's \\"Changes\\" is a very overrated song, and \\"Live Together\\" is not very good either. If Buddy Miles was Mitch Mitchell then this would be a classic. Billy Cox and Hendrix are in very good form though. For the bass and guitar it is a good buy.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|It seems Hollywood will take any excuse to get Angelina Jolie running around with a gun and makeup. The plot of this movie is laughably bad. It revives Cold War fears of Russian sleeper agents, except Jolie's character Salt can take on squads of Americans without getting a scratch. The movie does a good job at keeping the audience guessing, to the point where I was even surprised by one or two of the plot twists. But overall it's fairly predictable and silly. I'd give it 2 stars, plus an additional star for managing to make Angelina Jolie look hot as both a blonde and brunette.
0449000729|4.0|To call this 900+ tome a saga is selling it short because this ambition undertaking by Rutherford encompasses the history -- from the last iceage, Michener-esque style -- right up to the 1980s of present day Salisbury, England.  Generations of the same handful of fictional families are traced and through them, Rutherford gives what is perhaps the most comprehensive history of this area that includes ancient Stonehenge.  Not for the faint of heart.  But well worth the read, especially if you plan on visiting the area.  His characterizations are wonderful and his history detailed.  And don't expect a family-saga just because the same families are traced through the years....frequently family lines disappear, only to reappear multiple generations later.  And whatever you do, don't expect a fairy tale ending....Rutherford is good with plot twists.  The novel is definitely an investment of your time.  No skimming allowed in this one or you'll lose the thread of the story.  Take your time, read it slowly and enjoy.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Selected the Bushnell tour v2 over the Callaway model and couldn't be happier with the Bushnell.  I like focusing on creeks and traps to get the distance to those hazards as well as pins.  Or, I pick a spot in front of the green for a layup shot and get that distance--no more second guessing the distance during the back swing!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory series so much. I pop in a disc from this collection almost everyday and can say the actors lines before they do. Jim Parsons (Sheldon) and Johhny Galecki (Leonard) are comedic geniouses.
